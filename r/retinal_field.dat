40|$|AbstractZebrafish retinal {{homeobox}} genes rx 1 and rx 2 {{are expressed}} {{exclusively in the}} optic primordia and then in cone photoreceptors of the differentiated neural retina. In this study, we show that the rx expression domain is coextensive with the region identified as the <b>retinal</b> <b>field</b> in published fate maps of the neural plate in zebrafish embryos. Analysis of the spatiotemporal relationships between retinal and forebrain precursors suggests that lateral movement of retinal precursors is responsible for evagination of the optic primordia. Overexpression of either rx 1 or rx 2 results {{in the loss of}} forebrain tissue and the ectopic formation of retinal tissue. We asked whether the deletion of forebrain and expansion of retinal tissue could be explained by the death of telencephalic precursors and enhanced proliferation of retinal precursors, and we found that it could not. Instead, our data are consistent with a change in cell fate of forebrain precursors associated with reduced expression of telencephalic markers (emx 1 and BF- 1) and ectopic expression of retinal markers (rx 1 / 2 / 3, pax 6, six 6, and vsx 2) at the neural keel stage. The rx homeodomain alone is sufficient to induce ectopic retinal tissue, although weakly so, and this observation, together with results from deletion constructs, suggests that interactions with unidentified transcriptional regulators are important for rx 1 and rx 2 function during early eye development. We conclude that regulated expression of zebrafish rx 1 and rx 2 helps to define the region of the forebrain fated to give rise to retinal tissue and may be involved in the cellular migrations that lead to splitting of the <b>retinal</b> <b>field</b> and formation of the optic primordia...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the problem of}} hierarchical processing of visual information extracted {{with a layer of}} pseudo-randomly tessellated <b>retinal</b> receptive <b>fields.</b> Afferents from the retinal neural layer were processed by a cortical neuron layer resulting in a hierarchy of feature extraction operations similar to that found in biological vision systems. The retinal tessellation was obtained by self-organization such that <b>retinal</b> neuron receptive <b>field</b> locations were allocated across the system’s field-of-view in a space-variant manner. The retinal tessellation seamlessly merged from a central dense uniform fovea region to a sparser space-variant surrounding periphery. The neural system therefore extracted high acuity visual information from the central foveal region and progressively coarser information from a space-variant increasingly coarse periphery. The paper addresses the issues of i) generating a retinal tessellation with a uniform fovea that seamlessly merges into a space-variant periphery, ii) sampling visual information contained in a digital image with pseudo-randomly positioned <b>retinal</b> neuron receptive <b>fields,</b> iii) performing hierarchical feature extraction on pseudo-randomly spaced visual information, iv) multi-resolution feature extraction using self-organized retinae, v) the targeting of the space-variant machinery by generating saccades based on bottom-up attention.

Inactivation of Pax 6 in vivo results in loss of competent RSCs as assayed by the failure to form clonal RSC spheres from the optic vesicles of conventional Pax 6 knockout embryos and from the ciliary epithelial cells of adult Pax 6 conditional knockout mice. In vitro clonal inactivation of Pax 6 in adult RSCs results in a serious proliferation defect, suggesting that Pax 6 is required for the proliferation and expansion of RSCs...|$|E

The goal {{of this paper is}} to introduce a system, known as RIVERS (Retinal Image Vessel Extraction and Registration System), which provides the community of retinal clinicians, researchers, and study directors an integrated suite of advanced digital retinal image analysis tools over the Internet. The capabilities include vasculature tracing and morphometry, joint (simultaneous) montaging of multiple <b>retinal</b> <b>fields,</b> cross-modality registration (color/red-free fundus photographs, and fluorescein angiograms), and generation of flicker animations for visualization of changes from longitudinal image sequences.

40|$|Abstract—Histogram equalization, {{which aims}} at {{information}} maximization, {{is widely used}} in different ways to perform contrast enhancement in images. In this paper, an automatic exact histogram specification technique is proposed and used for global and local contrast enhancement of images. The desired histogram is obtained by first subjecting the image histogram to a modification process and then by maximizing a measure that represents increase in information and decrease in ambiguity. A new method of measuring image contrast based upon local band-limited approach and center-surround <b>retinal</b> receptive <b>field</b> model is also devised in this paper. This method works at multiple scales (frequency bands) and combines the contrast measures obtained at different scales using Lp-norm.

Digital enhancement of contrast and brightness was performed and a X 2 digital zoom was utilised.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{conspicuous}} behavioral effects produced by surgical rotation of the eyeball through 180 degrees is the forced circling or spontaneous optokinetic reaction. Animals with inverted vision caused by eye rotation tend to turn continuously in circles (4, 6, 8). In fishes and amphibians this circling may persist indefinitely {{with little or no}} correction by reeducation. Similar circus movement is caused by contralateral transplantation of the eyeball with inversion on only one axis and also by cross-connection of the optic nerves to {{the wrong side of the}} brain (7). In all these situations movement on the part of the animal causes the visual image to pass over the <b>retinal</b> <b>field</b> or its central projection in a direction opposite to normal. The forced circling phenomenon of inverted vision is an illustration of the importance of kinesthetic effects in visual perception.

30|$|Beyond the {{multiscale}} {{nature of}} retinal representation, {{it has also}} been shown that some <b>retinal</b> receptive <b>fields</b> have far extended surround seen in the lateral mechanism of both horizontals and amacrine cells in the retina compared to the <b>retinal</b> classical receptive <b>fields</b> (CRFs) size. The idea of non-classical receptive fields (nCRFs) was first introduced by Passaglia et al. [95] with modelling RFs based on widely spread surround. This representation provides some evidence for even specific orientation tuning cells in the retina. Therefore, retinal visual output contains not only the edge map with multiscale edge information including the shades and brightness profile around the edges, but also their orientations as a result of multiscale and orientation processing of some retinal cells. This along with other evidence suggests that in many stages of our visual processing, there is spatial filtering adjustment involved such as eye movements, which creates an adaptable spatial size mechanism in the retinal ganglion cells [54]. Shapiro and Lu [64] argue that for brightness perception, the spatial filter size is relative to the object size in the whole image, which is consistent with the spatial vision literature not the retinal spatial frequency. Our DoG model has the same property.|$|R

Although pax 6 is expressed in the whole prospective <b>retinal</b> <b>field,</b> subsequently its expression becomes restricted to the optic cup by reciprocal transcriptional repression of pax 6 and pax 2 However, it remains unclear how Pax 6 protein {{is removed from the}} eyestalk territory on time. Here, we report that Mid 1, a member of the RBCC/TRIM E 3 ligase family, which was first identified in patients with the X-chromosome-linked Opitz BBB/G (OS) syndrome, interacts with Pax 6. We found that the forming eyestalk is a major domain of mid 1 expression, controlled by the morphogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Here, Mid 1 regulates the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Pax 6 protein. Accordantly, when Mid 1 levels are knocked down, Pax 6 expression is expanded and eyes are enlarged. Our findings indicate that remaining or misaddressed Pax 6 protein is cleared from the eyestalk region to properly set the border between the eyestalk territory and the retina via Mid 1. Thus, we identified a posttranslational mechanism, regulated by Sonic hedgehog, which is important to suppress Pax 6 activity and thus breaks pax 6 autoregulation at defined steps during the formation of the visual system...|$|E
40|$|The optics {{of the eye}} form {{an image}} on a surface {{at the back of}} the eyeball called the retina. The retina {{contains}} the photoreceptors that sample the image and convert it into a neural signal. The spacing of the photoreceptors in the retina is not uniform and varies with retinal locus. The central <b>retinal</b> <b>field,</b> called the macula, is densely packed with photoreceptors. The packing density falls off rapidly as a function of retinal eccentricity with respect to the macular region and there are regions in which there are no photoreceptors at all.

The neural transformations which convert retinal image signals into percepts fills in the gaps and regularizes the inhomogeneities of the retinal photoreceptor sampling mosaic. The filling-in mechamism plays an important role in understanding visual performance. The filling-in mechanism is not well understood. A systematic collaborative research program at the Ames Research Center and SRI in Menlo Park, California, was designed to explore this mechanism.
