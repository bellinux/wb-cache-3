5|$|The {{draft of}} the {{proposed}} DSM-V suggests dividing <b>RAD</b> into two disorders, Reactive Attachment Disorder for the current inhibited form of <b>RAD,</b> and Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder for what is currently the disinhibited form of <b>RAD,</b> with some alterations in the proposed DSM definition.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some {{within the field of}} attachment therapy that <b>RAD</b> may be quite prevalent because severe child maltreatment, which is known to increase risk for <b>RAD,</b> is prevalent and because children who are severely abused may exhibit behaviors similar to <b>RAD</b> behaviors. The APSAC Taskforce consider this inference to be flawed and questionable. Severely abused children may exhibit similar behaviors to <b>RAD</b> behaviors but there are several far more common and demonstrably treatable diagnoses which may better account for these difficulties. Further, many children experience severe maltreatment and do not develop clinical disorders. Resilience is a common and normal human characteristic. <b>RAD</b> does not underlie all or even most of the behavioral and emotional problems seen in foster children, adoptive children, or children who are maltreated and rates of child abuse and/or neglect or problem behaviors are not a benchmark for estimates of <b>RAD.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] An {{accidental}} radiation excursion occurring {{during a}} Pu 239 recovery operation resulted in significant exposure of three personnel, one exposure terminating in fatality. Radiation of the fatally exposed person was nonuniform, {{and it was}} possible only to estimate his average body dose and dose incident to specific body areas. His average fast neutron dose was estimated as about 900 <b>rads,</b> and p ray dose as 3000 - 4000 <b>rads.</b> The fast neutron doses incident to the head and upper abdomen were estimated as 2600 and 3000 <b>rads,</b> respectively, and the respective incident pray doses as about 7800 and 9000 <b>rads.</b> A second operator received a neutron dose estimated at 2. 6 <b>rads,</b> and his film badge showed a y-dose of 118 <b>rads.</b> The third personâ€™s neutron and y-doses were estimated as 1. 4 and 31. 5 <b>rads,</b> respectively. Most of the y-ray dose to the nonfatality exposed operators was accumulated during subsequent trips near the source...|$|R
5|$|There are {{two studies}} on the {{incidence}} of <b>RAD</b> relating to high risk and maltreated children in the U.S. Both used ICD, DSM and the DAI. The first, in 2004, reported that children from the maltreatment sample {{were significantly more likely}} to meet criteria for one or more attachment disorders than children from the other groups, however this was mainly the proposed new classification of disrupted attachment disorder rather than the DSM or ICD classified <b>RAD</b> or DAD. The second study, also in 2004, attempted to ascertain the prevalence of <b>RAD</b> and whether it could be reliably identified in maltreated rather than neglected toddlers. Of the 94 maltreated toddlers in foster care, 35% were identified as having ICD <b>RAD</b> and 22% as having ICD DAD, and 38% fulfilled the DSM criteria for <b>RAD.</b> This study found that <b>RAD</b> could be reliably identified and also that the inhibited and disinhibited forms were not independent. However, there are some methodological concerns with this study. A number of the children identified as fulfilling the criteria for <b>RAD</b> did in fact have a preferred attachment figure.|$|E

5|$|Epidemiological {{data are}} limited, but {{reactive}} attachment disorder {{appears to be}} very uncommon. The prevalence of <b>RAD</b> is unclear but it is probably quite rare, other than in populations of children being reared in the most extreme, deprived settings such as some orphanages. There is little systematically gathered epidemiologic information on <b>RAD.</b> A cohort study of 211 Copenhagen children {{to the age of}} 18 months found a prevalence of 0.9%.|$|E
5000|$|Habrobracon hebetor {{is remarkably}} {{resistant}} to radiation. While LD100 is estimated around 1000 <b>rads</b> for humans, and 56,128 <b>rads</b> (64,000 roentgens) for the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, a {{study showed that}} H. hebetor survived X-ray radiations of 158,080 <b>rads</b> (180,250 R). In this study, irradiated groups even had an increased life span compared to non-irradiated control groups. An effect attributed {{to the lack of}} activity of irradiated individuals.

5|$|<b>RAD</b> {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{researched}} and most poorly understood disorders in the DSM. There is little systematic epidemiologic information on <b>RAD,</b> its course is not well established and it appears difficult to diagnose accurately. There is a lack of clarity about the presentation of attachment disorders over the age of five years and difficulty in distinguishing between aspects of attachment disorders, disorganized attachment or the consequences of maltreatment.|$|E
5|$|Research {{from the}} late 1990s {{indicated}} there were disorders of attachment not captured by DSM or ICD and showed that <b>RAD</b> could be diagnosed reliably without evidence of pathogenic care, thus illustrating some of the conceptual difficulties with the rigid structure of the current definition of <b>RAD.</b> Research published in 2004 showed that the disinhibited form can endure alongside structured attachment behavior (of any style) towards the child's permanent caregivers.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{complexities of}} <b>RAD</b> mean that careful diagnostic evaluation by a trained mental health expert with particular expertise in differential diagnosis is considered essential. Several other disorders, such as conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, post traumatic stress disorder and social phobia share many symptoms {{and are often}} comorbid with or confused with <b>RAD,</b> leading to over and under diagnosis. <b>RAD</b> can also be confused with neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, pervasive developmental disorder, childhood schizophrenia and some genetic syndromes. Infants with this disorder can be distinguished from those with organic illness by their rapid physical improvement after hospitalization. Autistic children {{are likely to be}} of normal size and weight and often exhibit a degree of intellectual disability. They are unlikely to improve upon being removed from the home.|$|E
40|$|EVIDENCE has {{accumulated}} {{during the past}} few years that thyroid carcinoma in children and young adults has resulted from exposure to a few hundred <b>rads</b> radiation to the thyroid in infancy or early childhood (Pifer and Hempelmann, 1964). Doses of 500 to 2000 <b>rads</b> X-rays to the thyroid have been showin to induce adenomas and carcinomas of the thyroid in rats (Doniach, 1956; Frantz et al., 1957; Lindsay et al., 1961). It is of interest, and pertinent to the analysis of the carcinogenic action of radiation, to assess other biological effects oIn the thyroid of this order of radiation. 500 <b>rads</b> has no immediate recognisable action on the secretory function of the thyroid gland or on its morphology by light microscopy. Doniach and Logothetopoulos (1955) and Abbatt et al. (1957) found that 1000 <b>rads</b> X-rays to the rat thyroid produces marked impairment of response to a subsequent goitrogenic challenge. No definite impairment occurred after 500 <b>rads.</b> Recently, Crooks, Greig, Macgregor and McIntosh (1964) showed that doses of X-rays up to 1600 <b>rads</b> have no effect on iodide trapping function by the rat thyroid but reported evidence suggestive that as little as 50 <b>rads</b> impair...|$|R

5|$|There is {{one case}} study on maltreated twins {{published}} in 1999 with a follow-up in 2006. This study assessed the twins {{between the ages of}} 19 and 36 months, during which time they suffered multiple moves and placements. The paper explores the similarities, differences and comorbidity of <b>RAD,</b> disorganized attachment and post traumatic stress disorder. The girl showed signs of the inhibited form of <b>RAD</b> while the boy showed signs of the indiscriminate form. It was noted that the diagnosis of <b>RAD</b> ameliorated with better care but symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder and signs of disorganized attachment came and went as the infants progressed through multiple placement changes. At age three, some lasting relationship disturbance was evident.|$|E
5|$|According to the AACAP Practice Parameter (2005) the {{question}} of whether attachment disorders can reliably be diagnosed in older children and adults has not been resolved. Attachment behaviors used for the diagnosis of <b>RAD</b> change markedly with development and defining analogous behaviors in older children is difficult. There are no substantially validated measures of attachment in middle childhood or early adolescence. Assessments of <b>RAD</b> past school age may not be possible at all as by this time children have developed along individual lines {{to such an extent that}} early attachment experiences are only one factor among many that determine emotion and behavior.|$|E
40|$|Whole-body {{exposure}} of mice to 50, 100, 300, or 500 <b>rads</b> {{results in an}} acute dose-related {{decrease in the number}} of viable recirculating T cells. The magnitude of this decrement becomes more pronounced with the passage of time. The dose-response relationship over this range of dosages appears to consist of three components: a steep drop between 0 and 50 <b>rads,</b> a plateau between 50 and 500 <b>rads,</b> and a second drop between 300 and 500 <b>rads.</b> The residual radioresistant cells are able to recognize a histoincompatible skin graft during the initial 5 days after irradiation. Low to moderate doses (50 to 300 <b>rads)</b> abrogate the partial tolerance noted in nonirradiated recipients exposed to the skin graft for 5 days and then regrafted from the same donor source 25 days after complete removal of the primary graft. A large (500 <b>rads)</b> dose results in prolonged graft survival in comparison with the nonirradiated group. It is suggested that the subpopulation fo recirculating T cells which develops partial tolerance during a 5 -day exposure to a homograft is more radiosensitive than the effector subpopulation which is involved in graft rejection...|$|R

5|$|The {{most common}} and empirically {{supported}} method for assessing attachment in infants (11 monthsâ€“17 months) is the Strange Situation Protocol, developed by Mary Ainsworth {{as a result of}} her careful in-depth observations of infants with their mothers in Baltimore, USA (see below). The Strange Situation Protocol is a research tool that was not intended for diagnostic purposes. While the procedure may be used to supplement clinical impressions, the resulting classifications should not be confused with the psychiatric diagnosis 'Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD)'. The clinical concept of <b>RAD</b> differs in a number of fundamental ways from the theory and research driven attachment classifications based on the Strange Situation Procedure. The idea that insecure attachments are synonymous with <b>RAD</b> is, in fact, not accurate and leads to ambiguity when formally discussing attachment theory as it has evolved in the research literature. This is not to suggest that the concept of <b>RAD</b> is without merit, but rather that the clinical and research conceptualizations of insecure attachment and attachment disorder are not synonymous.|$|E

40|$|Possible {{protective}} {{effects of the}} agonist [D-Trp 6]LH-RH (analog of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone in which Gly- 6 is replaced by D-tryptophan) and antagonist N-Ac-[D-Phe(pCI) 1, 2,D-Trp 3,D-Arg 6,D-Ala 10]LH-RH against testicular damage caused by x-radiation were investigated in rats. Three months after being subjected to x-irradiation of the testes with 415 or 622 <b>rads,</b> control rats showed marked reduction in the weights of the testes and elevated levels of LH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), indicating tubular damage. Histological studies demonstrated that, in testes of rats given 415 <b>rads,</b> most seminiferous tubules had only Sertoli cells and no germinal cells, and, in the group given 622 <b>rads,</b> the depression of spermatogenesis was even more marked. Rats pretreated for 50 days with LH-RH antagonist (1000 micrograms/kg of body weight per day) showed a complete recovery of testicular weights and spermatogenesis 3 months after 415 <b>rads</b> and showed partial recovery after 622 <b>rads,</b> and LH and FSH levels returned to normal {{in both of these}} groups. Thus, pretreatment of rats with LH-RH antagonist, by reversibly inhibiting gonadal function, protected the germinal cells of the testes against damaging effects of x-rays. Three experiments were also carried out in which the rats were pretreated for 1 - 2 months with long-acting microcapsules of the agonist [D-Trp 6]LH-RH, liberating 25 micrograms of the agonist per day. Some rats were then subjected to gonadal irradiation with 415 or 622 <b>rads</b> and allowed a recovery period of 2 - 4 months. In spite of pretreatment with [D-Trp 6]LH-RH, testicular weights were significantly lower and LH or FSH levels were elevated in the irradiated groups as compared with nonirradiated controls. The recovery of spermatogenesis was incomplete, and there was a {{decrease in the number of}} germinal cells after 415 <b>rads</b> and especially after 622 <b>rads.</b> On the basis of testicular weights, histology, and gonadotropin levels, it could be concluded that the agonist [D-Trp 6]LH-RH did not protect the rat testes exposed to 622 <b>rads</b> and, at most, only partially protected against 415 <b>rads.</b> These results suggest that pretreatment with LH-RH antagonists and possibly agonists, might decrease the testicular damage caused by radiation and accelerate the recovery of reproductive functions...|$|R

5|$|There are few data on comorbid {{conditions}}, {{but there}} are some conditions that arise in the same circumstances in which <b>RAD</b> arises, such as institutionalization or maltreatment. These are principally developmental delays and language disorders associated with neglect. Conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and social phobia share many symptoms and are often comorbid with or confused with <b>RAD.</b> Attachment disorder behaviors amongst institutionalized children are correlated with attentional and conduct problems and cognitive levels but nonetheless appear to index a distinct set of symptoms and behaviors.|$|E
5|$|While <b>RAD</b> {{is likely}} to occur in {{relation}} to neglectful and abusive treatment, automatic diagnoses on this basis alone cannot be made, as children can form stable attachments and social relationships despite marked abuse and neglect.|$|E
5|$|Findings {{from the}} studies of {{children}} from Eastern European orphanages indicate that persistence of the inhibited pattern of <b>RAD</b> is rare in children adopted out of institutions into normative care-giving environments. However, there is a close association between duration of deprivation and severity of attachment disorder behaviors. The quality of attachments that these children form with subsequent care-givers may be compromised, but they probably no longer meet criteria for inhibited <b>RAD.</b> The same group of studies suggests that a minority of adopted, institutionalized children exhibit persistent indiscriminate sociability even after more normative caregiving environments are provided. Indiscriminate sociability may persist for years, even among children who subsequently exhibit preferred attachment to their new caregivers.
