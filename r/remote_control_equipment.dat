5|$|In January 1944, workers {{laid the}} {{foundations}} for the first chemical separation building, T Plant located in 200-West. Both the T Plant and its sister facility in 200-West, the U Plant, were completed by October. (U Plant was used only for training during the Manhattan Project.) The separation building in 200-East, B Plant, was completed in February 1945. The second facility planned for 200-East was canceled. Nicknamed Queen Marys by the workers who built them, the separation buildings were awesome canyon-like structures 800 feet long, 65 feet wide, and 80 feet high containing forty process pools. The interior had an eerie quality as operators behind seven feet of concrete shielding manipulated <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>equipment</b> by looking through television monitors and periscopes from an upper gallery. Even with massive concrete lids on the process pools, precautions against radiation exposure were necessary and influenced all aspects of plant design.|$|E
25|$|After being {{fitted with}} buffers, these power cars began work as {{surrogate}} DVTs {{to work with}} the Class 91s and 89. The locomotives, working with conventional Mk3 stock, worked on the line between 1987 and 1991, when the last Class 91 locomotives entered service. As well as buffers being fitted to these powercars, special <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>equipment</b> was also added to the locomotives so they could be controlled by the locomotive at the front. Once these locomotives left DVT duties, the remote equipment was removed.|$|E
2500|$|SW900 #1453, Santa Fe's last [...] "standard" [...] EMD switcher, was {{retired in}} 1987, thereby making #1460 the only {{remaining}} end cab switcher on the roster. The Beep continued its work at Cleburne until the shops were closed later that year. Since then, the unit {{has worked as a}} shop switcher at both the Argentine shops in Kansas City and in Topeka, Kansas. The locomotive was equipped with <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>equipment</b> (RCE) in the early 1990s so that it could be operated from a distance.|$|E
40|$|<b>Remote</b> <b>controlled</b> {{switches}} (RCS) {{are used}} to enhance the recovering process of distribution grids. Commonly installed on MV-lines to sectionize feeders, they are a cheap and efficient way to improve the B criterion {{as well as the}} incident localisation speed. This document explains and models the impact of <b>Remote</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>equipment</b> on B criterion and reactivity depending on grid structure and organisation (II and III). This model is then used to define an optimal <b>remote</b> <b>controlled</b> switcher number per feeder on each specific area (V). It leads to two main results: French territory is not homogeneously equipped and a lot of areas need a strong RCS policy. RCS efficiency on distributor performance is also proved to be high even for well-equipped areas...|$|R

40|$|Laboratory {{tests are}} crucial in {{education}} and training of engineers. Experimental equipment and process simulators are extremely expensive. It is not possible and justified economically to build such laboratories, for educational purposes, in large number of schools. On the other hand, education and training based on video films, etc., is not adequate and personal contact of students with a process is absolutely necessary. Thus, the solution of virtual ring-rolling laboratory connected with e-Learning platform is proposed in this paper. Due to this approach students of metallurgy and materials science faculties will be given the possibility of performance of real experiments using <b>remote</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>equipment</b> and {{will be able to}} observe the results while being far from the real laboratory. The details of the idea of such virtual laboratory is presented below including its design, functional requirements description and future perspectives...|$|R

50|$|<b>Remote</b> <b>control</b> mining <b>equipment</b> usually {{refers to}} mining {{vehicles}} such as excavators or bulldozers that are controlled with a handheld <b>remote</b> <b>control.</b> An operator stands in line-of-sight {{and uses the}} <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> to perform the normal vehicle functions. Because visibility and feel of the machine are heavily reduced, vehicle productivity is generally reduced as well using <b>remote</b> <b>control.</b> <b>Remote</b> <b>control</b> technology is generally used to enable mining equipment to operate in dangerous conditions such as unstable terrain, blast areas or in high risk areas of falling debris, or underground mining. <b>Remote</b> <b>control</b> technology is generally the least expensive way to automate mining equipment making it an ideal entry point for companies looking to test the viability of robotic technology in their mine.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years there has been an upsurge of {{interest}} in automated mining equipment, ranging from in-vehicle assistance systems (such as collision detection) through to visions of a fully automated and ‘people-less’ mine of the future. This project is aimed at understanding how new technologies can be developed in ways that take into account the human factors issues related to remote controlled/ automated mining equipment. In particular, this ongoing research is analysing the skills and cognitive capabilities that will be required to operate or maintain <b>remote</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>equipment,</b> where the focus is upon developing optimal interface designs to address performance gaps, rather than purely relying on operator training. Initially, the work includes conducting literature reviews, compiling an “active” database of existing and emerging technologies, and interviewing technology developers, regulators, managers and end-users. The interviews are ongoing at the time of writing and are still to be completed and fully analysed. Tentative analysis of the results of this work show several themes emerging. The work to date will be presented in the poster...|$|R

50|$|When a {{locomotive}} {{is converted to}} a CCRCL the traction motors and fuel tank are removed. The windows are plated over, the locomotive is painted gray with red lettering, and <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>equipment</b> is installed.

Montana Rail Link trains operate between Billings, MT and Spokane, WA using trackage rights over BN successor BNSF Railway's tracks connecting those points.

40|$|Introducing the SmartGrid goes in {{hand with}} the {{deployment}} {{of a large number of}} devices and with the establishment of a rather conmplex communication infrastructure. SmartGrid equipment like SmartMeters, other <b>remote</b> sensors, <b>control</b> <b>equipment,</b> or additional sub-stations, all have different security requirements. Common to all of them is that each device needs to be securely identified in the infrastructure and that proper security management needs to be in place. To allow for remote management, security functionality has to be incorporated in the design of a device. Furthermore, unique identities and establishment of cryptographic keys for secure communication requires an individual initial configuration of each device. Currently, this initial configuration is a manual operation executed during deployment, often by copying configuration data from memory devices such as USB tokens or SD cards. This paper introduces a novel and secure approach to support efficient roll-out processes in the domain of SmartGrid equipment providing for a faster and cost efficient scheme using already available and standardized security technologies. The main goal is to totally remove any direct physical interaction with the device during deployment and without any client-specific preconfiguration...|$|R
