5|$|News that Marc Anthony was {{recording}} an English-language album {{began in}} 1996 when RMM executive Ralph Mercado mentioned the possibility following a joint-venture between RMM (Anthony's former <b>record</b> <b>label)</b> and MCA Records.

After the release of his third studio album Contra la Corriente in 1997, disputes over business practices arose between him and Mercado. Anthony suspected that he was not receiving full payment from his <b>record</b> <b>label</b> for his recordings. Mercado would not allow Anthony to leave the <b>record</b> <b>label</b> because his contract committed Anthony to record four more albums for RMM.|$|E

25|$|As the RIAA curve was {{essentially}} an American standard, it had little impact outside the USA {{until the late}} 1970s when European <b>recording</b> <b>labels</b> began to adopt the RIAA equalization. It was even later when some Asian <b>recording</b> <b>labels</b> adopted the RIAA standard. In 1989, many Eastern European <b>recording</b> <b>labels</b> and Russian <b>recording</b> <b>labels</b> such as Melodiya were still using their own CCIR equalization. Hence the RIAA curve did not truly become a global standard until the late 1980s.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} music {{industry}} as a whole, and delves more specifically into how new technologies have disrupted the old business model. Advances in technology such as the Internet, MP 3 s, and file-sharing software {{have made it possible}} to bypass the traditional role of <b>record</b> <b>labels,</b> thus creating a closer link between artists and consumers. As {{the music industry}} transformed over time, the role of <b>record</b> <b>labels</b> became less defined. This has left once behemoth labels struggling to find a competitive advantage in a rapidly devolving industry. <b>Record</b> <b>labels</b> are no longer the most relevant segment of the music industry, and this work provides an in-depth analysis of the processes that destroyed their relevance. This thesis begins by examining the music industry at a macro level, before tracking <b>record</b> <b>labels</b> from their prominence to their current marginalized role. Advancements in MP 3, P 2 P networks, and other consumer-enabling technologies have transformed the music industry. The lack of a significant response to this shifting landscape within the industry has left <b>record</b> <b>labels</b> on a slippery slope towards extinction. As <b>record</b> <b>labels</b> failed to adapt to shifting demand and changing methods of consumption, private entrepreneurs have intervened to solve inefficiencies in the market. This thesis will leave the reader with an expansive knowledge of how the music industry has transformed, as well as its future trajectory without <b>record</b> <b>labels...</b>|$|R
