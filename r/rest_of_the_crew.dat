At approximately 8:00pm, a warning light flashed in the cockpit, indicating that the aft airstair apparatus had been activated.

Only four persons on the Tokyo set were French; the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> was Japanese. Marc Caro worked as the supervisor of set designs in Tokyo. According to Noé, Caro had three months free after finishing Dante 01, his first effort as a solo director, so Noé asked him to come to Japan.|$|E

5|$|Frakes {{believes}} that the main themes of First Contact—and Star Trek as a whole—are loyalty, friendship, honesty and mutual respect. This {{is evident in the}} film when Picard chooses to rescue Data rather than evacuate the ship with the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew.</b> The film makes a direct comparison between Picard's hatred of the Borg and refusal to destroy the Enterprise and that of Captain Ahab in Herman Melville's novel Moby-Dick. The moment marks {{a turning point in the}} film as Picard changes his mind, symbolized by his putting down his gun. A similar Moby-Dick reference was made in , and although Braga and Moore did not want to repeat it, they decided it worked so well they could not leave it out.|$|E
5|$|The {{reversal}} of course {{brought her back}} in range of the British battlecruisers, however, which quickly opened fire and scored several damaging hits. The order to abandon ship was given, and men began gathering on the deck. Engineers set scuttling charges while the men topside prepared {{to go into the}} water. At 14:25, the ship rolled over and sank. The survivors expected the British to pick them up, but they instead departed. German ships searched the area three days later, to find only one survivor, Leading Stoker Neumann; the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> had died in the water. The wreck was moved in August 1979 to render it less of an underwater hazard. Some parts of the ship were salvaged and are now preserved in the Cuxhaven Shipwreck Museum.|$|E
5|$|The {{sight of}} the burning wrecks in the night once again spread panic {{throughout}} the French fleet, the grounded ships opening a heavy fire on the scuttled ships in the assumption that they were fireships. Captain Lacaille of Tourville was so unnerved that he immediately ordered his crew to abandon ship {{and set it on}} fire. The evacuation was so hasty however that the fires did not spread effectively, and the following morning the ship was found to still be intact, the crew returning to their prematurely abandoned vessel. There they found that the ship's quartermaster Eugéne-Joseph-Romain Bourgeois had remained aboard, unconvinced by Lacaille's order, and had single-handedly driven off an attempt by a British boat to board and capture the ship. During the night about 30 sailors had joined him, keeping Touville in French hands until dawn came and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> returned.|$|E

5|$|Zimmer wrote {{several hours}} of music, and an {{abundance}} of different themes, before Malick started to shoot the film. The director played the music on the set, while filming, to get himself, and the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> and actors in the right frame of mind. The official soundtrack features tracks that were not used on the film and some tracks from the film are not found on the CD. The film features several pieces of Melanesian choral music sung by the Choir of All Saints in Honiara, only {{one of which is}} featured on the soundtrack. However, another soundtrack was released containing several tracks from the Choir, which has since gone out of circulation.|$|E
5|$|At Jason's behest, the demigods {{travel to}} Split {{to visit the}} tomb of Diocletian, {{retrieve}} his powerful scepter, and leave a note for Reyna (who has been asked by Annabeth to find the Greek demigods). The god Cupid, guardian of the scepter, refuses to relinquish it until Nico admits that he once {{had a crush on}} Percy Jackson. Sailing through the Adriatic Sea, the ship is attacked by Khione and the Boreads and is only narrowly defended by Piper's newly powerful charmspeaking skills; Piper is still disappointed in her performance and resolves to train in swordsmanship. During the attack, Leo is transported to Ogygia, where he falls in love with Calypso. Although he leaves the island, Leo promises to return for her. While Leo is detained, the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> meets with Notus, who helps Jason to realize that he has chosen to be a Greek rather than a Roman demigod, thus settling an internal conflict within himself. Jason later gives up his praetorship to Frank in accordance with this decision.|$|E
5|$|Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) {{continues}} to struggle in deciphering an encrypted Starfleet {{message that they}} previously obtained through the Hirogen relay system (""). Neelix (Ethan Phillips) returns to Voyager with a guest, Arturis (Ray Wise), who helped him obtain supplies. Arturis learns of the encoded message and offers to help decrypt it. He is successful, and finds that the message is from Starfleet Command, with a nearby set of coordinates where their means of getting back home can be found. Though the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> is elated at this news, Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) remains cautious, given that the Borg {{have never been able}} to assimilate Arturis' species. Voyager arrives at the provided coordinates to find an unmanned Starfleet vessel, the Dauntless, of unknown design. Aboard, they find the ship uses quantum slipstream technology, which will allow them to arrive back in the Alpha Quadrant within a few months.|$|E
