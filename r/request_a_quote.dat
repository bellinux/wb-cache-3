40|$|In California {{and several}} other states, {{businesses}} with employees are mandated to hold worker’s compensation coverage, which {{is a type of}} business insurance policy. A business owner obtains this coverage, as well as other needed insurance policies, by communicating with a commercial insurance broker. While insurance has existed for a couple of centuries, the process to obtain policies has remained mostly the same and has not completely adapted technologically to attract the new wave of millennial business owners. The business insurance industry will need to address how this technologically savvy generation will want to buy and negotiate their insurance policies. Currently, buying business insurance has many faults. The common means of communication, fax, postal service and in-person communication are very outdated and out of touch with our millennial business owners. These slower communication methods make understanding commercial insurance more confusing for millennial business owners. Our solution to bring business insurance into the digital age is by creating a web application that will act as a virtual broker platform. Business owners can take a variety of actions regarding their insurance policies, all in one place. They will easily be able to <b>request</b> <b>a</b> <b>quote,</b> fill out policy applications, communicate with their broker and view information about their policies. Through this web application, sensitive information is protected by the construction of a secure database and implementation of industry standard information security measures...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} models {{the impact}} of firm pricing decisions on different facets of the customer purchasing process in business-to-business (B 2 B) contexts and develops an integrated framework for inter-temporal targeted pricing to optimize long-term profitability for the firm. Pricing decisions in B 2 B settings are inherently different from those within the business-to-consumer (B 2 C) environment, commonly studied in marketing. First, B 2 B pricing often offers considerable flexibility in implementing first degree and inter-temporal price discrimination, i. e., sellers in B 2 B contexts can easily vary prices across customers and can even change prices between subsequent purchases by the same customer. While this flexibility affords significant opportunities for the firm, it also requires great care in ensuring long-term profitability. Second, transactions in the B 2 B environment are often more complex than those in B 2 C settings. Specifically, the business customer typically makes several interrelated decisions (e. g., when {{and how much to}} buy, whether to ask for a quote and whether to accept the seller's bid), which need to be modeled jointly. The proposed model considers these inter-related decisions in an integrated fashion. In addition, the model accounts for heterogeneity in customers' preferences and behaviors, asymmetric reference price effects, and purchase dynamics, while taking into account the short- and long-term implications of the pricing policy. To model the complexity of inter-related joint customer decisions, we use hierarchical Bayesian copulas, which weave together different marginal distributions to form joint distributions. To account for dynamics in purchase behavior and to model the possible long-term impact of experienced prices on the different components of the customer's decision, we use a non-homogenous hidden Markov model with multivariate interrelated state-dependent behaviors. In addition, we rely on the behavioral pricing literature in modeling the effect of price, using asymmetric reference price effects. We calibrated the model using longitudinal transaction data from a metals retailer. The results reveal several substantive insights about the short- and long-term impact of the firm's pricing decisions on each of the inter-related components of the customer's purchasing behavior. Specifically, we find positive interdependence between the quantity and purchase timing decisions and strong negative interdependence between the decision to <b>request</b> <b>a</b> <b>quote</b> and the decision to accept it. Capturing the long-term and asymmetric impact of reference prices, we find that losses not only have larger negative effects relative to gains on customers' buying behavior, but customers also take longer to adapt to losses than they do to gains. Furthermore, the firm's pricing decisions could have a long-term impact on its customers by shifting their preferences between a "vigilant" state - characterized by a cautious approach towards ordering and heightened price sensitivity, and a more "relaxed" state. These dynamics imply that the B 2 B seller needs to carefully consider both the short- and the long-term consequences of its pricing policy when setting prices for each order. Additionally, the proposed model exhibits superior predictive performance relative to several benchmark models, and in a price policy simulation results in a 52 % improvement in profitability compared to the company's current practice. Through pricing simulations performed are made when pricing in volatile economic environments. Other policy simulations are conducted to examine how the B 2 B firm should price in the recent economic environment with volatile commodity prices. We find when commodity prices increase, the firm should pass the costs to the customers, when the prices decrease, the firm should "hoard" the profit...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a manufacturer using <b>a</b> <b>Request</b> For <b>Quotes</b> reverse auction {{in combination with}} supplier qualification screening to determine which qualified supplier will be awarded a contract. Supplier qualification screening is costly for the manufacturer, for example involving reference checks, financial audits, and on-site visits. The manufacturer seeks to minimize its total procurement costs, i. e. the contract payment plus qualification costs. While suppliers can be qualified prior to the auction (pre-qualification), we allow the manufacturer to delay {{all or part of}} the qualification until after the auction (post-qualification). Using an optimal mechanism analysis we analytically explore the tradeoffs between varying levels of pre- and post-qualification. While using post-qualification causes the expected contract payment to increase (bids from unqualified suppliers are discarded) we find that standard industrial practices of pre-qualification only can be improved upon by judicious use of post-qualification, particularly when supplier qualification screening is moderately expensive relative to the value of the contract to the buyer...|$|R
40|$|My {{abstract}} is {{a little}} different, because I perform a technical service rather than do research on a project. I work in the NPD (New Product Development) lab here on BSU campus, {{under the direction of}} Blaise Lawless. My primary work is related the SLA (Stereo Lithography Apparatus) machine, which is our 3 -D printer. I write up quotes for clients, create build platforms, and perform post-printing duties. The NPD lab on campus is a team made of Boise State professors, engineering students, and professional mechanical engineers. Their purpose is to help Idaho inventors, entrepreneurs, and manufacturers with product design, prototyping, and design for manufacturing needs. The lab has several pieces of equipment designed to further assist the team in achieving these goals, such as a CNC milling machine, the CUBE, and a SLA machine. When a client e-mails us <b>requesting</b> <b>a</b> <b>quote</b> on <b>a</b> project, or asks for a part to be built on the SLA machine, I write up <b>a</b> <b>quote</b> with the information. Once the build is given the go-ahead by the client, my job is to take the SolidWorks-generated parts and place them onto a build platform through a computer program called LightYear. This program places the parts on a ‘platform’ that the SLA machine can read. The importance of this step is because of how the SLA machine builds the parts. The SLA machine holds a vat of resin that contains the liquid, plastic-like material that the physical parts are made of. This resin can be transformed from a liquid state to a solid form by the exposure to UV (ultra-violet) rays. The machine uses a UV laser for this process. The physical parts made by this machine are built on a metal, perforated square about eleven inches by eleven inches and about the thickness of a dinner plate. This ‘plate’ is set on two metal arms, called the ‘elevator’, suspended above the vat filled with resin. The SLA then reads the program that I have set up in Lightyear and begins the building process. The physical parts are uniquely built. The metal plate is lowered into the resin, then raised. The UV laser begins to harden the resin left on the plate in an outline coming from the pattern that is read from the LightYear program. After this, the metal plate is lowered again into the resin, where it will be raised and the process is repeated. In this way, the physical part is built, layer by layer, until completion. Because the physical parts cannot be built directly onto the metal plate, supports are first built. These ‘supports’ are like stilts that the part can sit upon. This is done because after the part is built, it must be removed from the metal plate without damaging the physical part. The supports are built for this purpose; they are broken off to remove the part from the metal plate. Later, the remaining bits of supports are sanded off from the physical part. After the part is built from the SLA machine, it must be rinsed of excess resin. This is because the resin, when left in the liquid form, is sticky, messy, and toxic. Therefore, the part is placed in a vat of liquid called poly-flush. This liquid helps to separate the remaining liquid resin from the part. After the part is washed in the poly-flush, I hand-rinse each part in isopropyl alcohol in a further effort to remove all the excess resin. After this brief wash, each part is blown dry with an air hose, and set in a well-ventilated room to finish drying. Once each part is dry, I place the parts into a UV oven to complete the hardening, or ‘curing’, process. This is much like placing pottery into a kiln for finishing. Finally, the parts come out of the oven. At this point, I am able to use a light-grit sandpaper to get any remaining bits of supports off, as well as sand down any cosmetic blemishes that may have occurred during the build. After this step, the parts are finished, so I package the parts into a box. Later, the parts are mailed to the client...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} two {{mechanisms to}} procure differentiated goods: <b>a</b> <b>request</b> for <b>quote</b> and <b>an</b> English auction with bidding credits. In {{the request for}} quote, each seller submits a price and the inherent quality of his good. Then the buyer selects the seller who offers the greatest difference in quality and price. In the English auction with bidding credits, the buyer assigns a bidding credit to each seller conditional upon {{the quality of the}} seller’s good. Then the sellers compete in an English auction with the winner receiving the auction price and his bidding credit. Game theoretic models predict the request for quote is socially efficient but the English auction with bidding credits is not. The optimal bidding credit assignment under compensates for quality advantages, creating a market distortion in which the buyer captures surplus {{at the expense of the}} seller’s profit and social efficiency. In experiments, the request for quote is less efficient than the English auctions with bidding credits. Moreover, both the buyer and seller receive more surplus in the English auction with bidding credits. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the problem faced by a seller in determining an optimal price to quote {{in response to}} <b>a</b> <b>Request</b> for <b>Quote</b> (RFQ) from <b>a</b> prospective buyer. The optimal price is determined by maximizing expected profit, given the underlying seller costs of the bid items and a computed probability of winning the bid {{as a function of}} price and other bid features such as buyer characteristics and the degree of competition. An entropy-based information-gain metric is used to quantify the contribution of the extracted features to predicting the win/loss label. A naive Bayes classification model is developed to predict the bid outcome (win or loss) as a function of these features. This model naturally generates the win probability as a function of bid price required to compute the optimal price. Results obtained by applying this model to a database of bid transactions involving computer sales demonstrate statistically significant lift curves for predicting bid outcome. A method for creating additional synthetic bids to improve computation of the win probability function is demonstrated. Finally, the computed optimal prices generated via this approach are compared to the actual bid prices approved by human pricing experts...|$|R
