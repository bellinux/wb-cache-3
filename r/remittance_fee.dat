40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} increasing remittances. It is often argued that the <b>remittance</b> <b>fee</b> needs to be lowered to increase remittances. We show that remittances become larger by increasing the receiving fee whereas they become larger by reducing the sending fee. We also show that, by transferring the sending fee from the migrant to the household, remittances become larger than those without transfer. It is shown that for this purpose the home country’s government can collect the sending fee from the household as taxes, and to pay it to the migrant as a subsidy...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{terrorist}} attacks of September 11, 2001, there has been increased public interest in informal funds transfer (IFT) systems. This paper examines the informal hawala system, an IFT system found predominantly in the Middle East and South Asia. The paper examines the historical and socioeconomic context within which the hawala has evolved, the operational features that make it susceptible to potential financial abuse, the fiscal and monetary implications for hawala-remitting and hawala-recipient countries, and current regulatory and supervisory responses.

40|$|The {{remittances}} that migrants send {{to their}} home countries {{are one of the}} largest international financial flows to the developing world. A common policy recommendation is that <b>remittance</b> transaction <b>fees</b> should be lowered. This paper provides the first empirical evidence on the causal impact of <b>remittance</b> transaction <b>fees</b> on <b>remittance</b> flows via a field experiment among migrants from El Salvador in the Washington D. C. area. In partnership with a local money transmitter, we randomly assigned migrants differently-sized discounts on <b>remittance</b> transaction <b>fees.</b> Reductions in <b>remittance</b> <b>fees</b> led to large increases in remittances sent to the migrant’s home country. A $ 1 reduction in fees led migrants to send $ 25 more remittances per month via our partner institution. Increases in remittances occurred via increases in the frequency of transactions, and not on funds sent per transaction. There is no evidence that this increase in remittances represents shifting of funds previously sent via other remittance channels, funds sen...|$|R

(2010) suggest that lowering <b>remittance</b> <b>fees</b> induce Salvadorian emigrants {{to send a}} larger annual amount, but also to send remittances more frequently, for example, every month instead of quarterly. This might translate into a more predictable flow for the recipients even though the authors do not specifically test whether that is the case.|$|R
50|$|Western Union {{has been}} accused of {{engaging}} in anti-competitive behavior in Africa {{as a result of a}} lack of competition on the continent. According to a report by the Overseas Development Institute, this allows Western Union to artificially inflate its fees for money transfers, charging what has been called an “Africa charge” of 8% consistently “applied across countries regardless of the size of the market, regulatory costs or market risk.” However, the fees can be as high as 10% or more, depending on the region. Africa’s remittance market remains the most expensive in the world, and the region is estimated to incur a financial loss of $1.4 billion to $2.3 billion per year as a result of these high <b>remittance</b> <b>fees.</b>|$|R
40|$|Small Island Nations (SINs) {{experience}} similar development issues {{because of}} their geographical constraints. Smallness of both the economy and population, as well as remoteness from major markets are primary causes of economic vulnerability. Trade deficits continue and are financed by economic assistance, worker's <b>remittances,</b> <b>fees</b> from fishing rights and international tourism income. In the current era of globalization, the international environment is changing, Newly industrialized economies in Asia, such as the Republic of Korea, the Peoples Republic of China and the Republic of China (Taiwan), are maintaining positive economic growth. Per capita income is increasing, as is international tourism demand. This situation can potentially be {{a great opportunity for}} SINs to achieve economic development through the promotion of international tourism since they are abundant in both natural and cultural tourism resources. Too heavy a promotion of international tourism, however, might have negative impacts on SINs in terms of their environmental and cultural carrying capacity. A large array of developmental issues remain unresolved in SINs. Promoting international tourism is one solution for earning foreign exchange but external income resources have to be diversified.

25|$|The most {{important}} {{move to a}} market-oriented exchange rate was an easing of controls on trade and other current account transactions, as occurred in several very early steps. In 1979 the State Council approved a system allowing exporters and their provincial and local government owners to retain a share of their foreign exchange earnings, referred to as foreign exchange quotas. At the same time, the government introduced measures to allow retention of part of the foreign exchange earnings from non-trade sources, such as overseas <b>remittances,</b> port <b>fees</b> paid by foreign vessels, and tourism.|$|R
40|$|A {{remarkable}} {{fact of the}} mushrooming remittances {{market is}} the absence of commercial banks as relevant players. Furthermore, remittances have been identified as a potential catalyst for the financial deepening of receiving countries through higher access to banking services by migrants' families. Building upon these features, this paper sets up a two-period financial model of remittances without uncertainty. The formulation acknowledges, on the one hand, the altruism component of remittances sent by migrants to their families and, on the other hand, the dominant position of Money Transfer Operators (MTO's) due to migrants' mistrust to banks, which hinders the access of banks to the market. Altruism compounded with a non-competitive market allows MTO's to set excessively high <b>remittance</b> <b>fees</b> and to attain monopolistic rents. The model shows that banks can challenge this position thanks to their role as providers of remunerated saving and credit, which enables them to overcome the competitive disadvantage derived by migrants' mistrust. Notwithstanding this, the main positive impact of banks' entry is attained through higher competition, not through the provision of financial services. All in all, the entry of banks reduces the fees and increases the level of remittances, allows an optimal consumption smoothing and improves the welfare of migrants and their families, although it also increases the volatility of remittances. banks, financial development, migrations, remittances...|$|R

I review the overall magnitude of remittances and what current research reveals about the motivations for migrant remittances and what effects they have. I discuss field experimental evidence on migrant desires for control over the uses of their remittances. I highlight some key distinctive characteristics of remittances—such as their high frequency and relatively small individual magnitudes—as well as recent experimental evidence {{on the effect of}} reductions in <b>remittance</b> transaction <b>fees,</b> and outline a research agenda on the microeconomics of remittance decision making. Finally, I discuss what the future holds for remittances, considering aggregate trends but also approaches likely to be taken by international development agencies, national governments, the private sector, and academic economists. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a survey conducted by the World Bank of central banks in 40 developing countries across different regions in the world. The survey focused on the following topics: (1) coverage of national statistics on remittances, (2) cost of transferring and delivering remittances, (3) regulatory regime for remittance transactions, and (4) efforts of developing countries to channel remittance flows through formal financial institutions. The study finds that in most countries existing data do not reflect the full amount of remittance inflows that they receive every year. Coverage of instruments and financial institutions through which remittances take place is limited. Moreover, only a few countries measure remittances that take place through informal channels. It also finds that the scope of financial authorities in developing countries to reduce <b>remittance</b> <b>fees</b> is limited because {{a large part of the}} fees charged to customers are set by financial institutions located in the countries where transactions originate. Cooperation between sending and recipient countries is needed to reduce remittance costs. The survey finds that in several countries money transfer companies are not properly supervised. Given the increasing international concerns with money laundering and terrorism financing issues, it is important that basic registration and reporting requirements are introduced for money transfer companies. Registration and reporting requirements should be designed in such a way that they do not deter the further development of this type of financial institution. Finally, the survey finds that most countries need to establish better mechanisms that would allow them to maximize the developmental effect of remittance inflows. By establishing new savings and investment instruments for remittance recipient households, a larger part of remittance flows might be channeled to finance productive investments, thus fostering economic growth.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} Chinese Shanxi piaohao, {{arguably the most}} important Chinese indigenous financial institutions in the nineteenth century, which emerged in one particular province. Concentrating on their governance structure, business strategy, and historical development, my thesis explores the emergence, growth and decline of the piaohao, and asks how they solved the commitment problem and developed their business by means of modern economists’ tools, such as path dependency and the principal agent model. This study uses a wealth of microeconomic data, which, although published, had not been digitized and properly analysed before. My work reveals that {{the emergence of the}} Shanxi piaohao shows reactive sequence path dependence. In a situation which gave little protection to shareholders’ capital, it imposed a highly centralized management structure, and a tenure- and performancebased incentive structure to discipline distant employees. Moreover, through establishing a widespread branch network, providing services {{to a wide range of}} clients, inventing various types of draft, and pricing <b>remittance</b> <b>fees</b> on diverse factors, the Shanxi piaohao were soon successful and controlled the Chinese remittance market for many decades. However, as it expanded and as China’s social and business environment became more unpredictable, the piaohao’s head managers reached the limits of their competence and its centralized management structure began to show diminishing returns. High financial leverage and a narrowed profits margin also indicated the hidden risks to the piaohao. When the 1911 Revolution broke out and ended China’s last feudal dynasty, many piaohao branches encountered immense losses from looting, bad loans and deposit withdrawals. It was during this time that modern Chinese banks and foreign banks penetrated the Chinese remittance market and poached the piaohao’s staff. Because the piaohao shareholders shared unlimited liabilities, when these threats materialized, many of them went bankrupt, while others turned to investments elsewhere and abandoned the piaohao...|$|R
40|$|The Philippines is {{the fourth}} largest {{recipient}} of remittances {{in the world with}} booming information and communications (ICT) services. In this study, we therefore explore the short-run and long-run nexus between remittance inflows, remittances interaction with financial development and ICT, trade openness and overseas development assistance (ODA) vis-à-vis income for the period 1976 to 2010 using ARDL bounds approach. The results show remittances and remittances interaction with ICT have positive effects on income. However, aid and remittances interaction with financial development have negative effects whereas trade openness is not statistically significant. Subsequently, encouraging remittance inflows though labour mobility, minimising transfer cost, harnessing benefits from mobile network operations, and reviewing <b>remittance</b> transfer <b>fees</b> via banking systems are would be ideal for scaling up ICT, and ensuring greater financial inclusion and sustainability of remittance inflows.

30|$|Despite the {{significance}} of migrants’ remittances, limited research has explored the ways to support remittances for DRM. The main efforts {{have focused on the}} transaction fees linked with remitting. The New Zealand-Pacific Remittance Project, for example, was a collaboration between key organizations in New Zealand and abroad, conducted by the World Bank’s Pacific office (Abel and Hailwood 2012). High-level public–private stakeholders from government agencies, central banks, and executives from remittance service providers met to discuss the state of the high <b>remittance</b> transfer <b>fees</b> to the Pacific Island region. The discussion resulted in a three-year project that was responsible for the reduction of transfer fees to PICs and was successful in providing accessible and easy-to-understand money transfer information via a website, and remittance cards that migrants could use to “top up” funds that could be used by nominated recipients in a PIC (Abel and Hailwood 2012). However, the project emphasized the views of the participating high-level organizations, with little input from the end users—the migrant senders—or consideration for aspects other than fees that may strengthen remittances for DRM. Yet, integrating the viewpoints of the migrants who send remittances is critical to designing policies that appropriately support DRM.|$|R

40|$|The historiography of {{economic}} relationships between Britain and the Southern Cone {{during the first}} half of the nineteenth century largely ignores trade. Yet, neither British direct, nor portfolio, investment was important during this period, when the main gains arose from trade, and directly associated invisible earnings: credits, shipping freights and insurance. British exports have long been taken for granted to the extent that there are no specific considerations of textile exports to Latin America. Between 1815 and 1859, textiles comprised over 80 per cent of British exports to the Southern Cone. This thesis considers in detail the process by which textiles were transferred from British manufacturers to local wholesalers. The various relationships between manufacturers, merchants, ship-brokers, underwriters and mercantile houses are assessed and analysed. New light is thrown on the relative roles of the consignment system and own account operations, advances against consignments, marine insurances, return <b>remittances,</b> commissions and <b>fees,</b> shipping strategies, packing, and on the use and management of samples and pattern books. Along with a lack of awareness of how British textiles were exported, little was known about the actual growth of Britain’s exports to this region. The picture painted by the historiography, which lacked robust data, was that early exports glutted the markets. It has been maintained that, thereafter, the small, low-income and scattered rural population of the Southern Cone had little to offer in exchange. Furthermore, it has also been put forward that high internal transport costs made this former backwater of the Spanish Empire nothing but a marginal market. This view considers the Southern Cone solely ‘responsible’ for the supposedly low volume of British exports. Post- 1860 s developments – railways and European migration on a sizeable scale – are regarded as being responsible for the growth of exports. This simplistic yet well-rooted approach is challenged. There was nothing exceptional in the development of the value of British exports to this market. When measured by volume, textiles exported by Britain to the Southern Cone expanded continuously throughout the 1820 s, 1830 s and 1840 s and at very high rates, in particular, if per capita consumption is considered. Apart from the factors considered in the historiography, an explanation of the Southern Cone’s increasing absorption of British manufactures from the 1820 s requires an examination of other local conditions as well as the changing situation in Britain, namely: improvements in packing of textiles; falling costs of productions in Britain; falling ocean freight rates; falling marine insurances; introduction of free trade in Britain; dramatic improvements in communications; falling import duties on the spot; better port facilities; struggle of local craft industries; and the establishment of a more stable political system on the spot...|$|R
