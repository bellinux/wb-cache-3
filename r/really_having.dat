[...] Of the writers in Salinger's generation, Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist John Updike attested that [...] "the short stories of J. D. Salinger really opened my eyes as to how you can weave fiction out {{of a set of}} events that seem almost unconnected, or very lightly connected... stick in my mind as <b>really</b> <b>having</b> moved me a step up, as it were, toward knowing how to handle my own material." [...] The critic Louis Menand has observed that the early stories of Pulitzer Prize-winner Philip Roth were affected by [...] "Salinger's voice and comic timing".|$|E

[...] "You hang out with all your bros and it's a great time and everything, but everybody wants {{to come home and}} have a girlfriend. And every time we'd fly home, Tom and [...] Scott [...] always had girlfriends waiting for them at the airport, and I didn't. It's about me being depressed and lonely out on tour, and not <b>really</b> <b>having</b> anything to come home to."

I think I was the last one to say yes.... I {{was actually}} blown away that they even wanted to. Once I found that out, I said 'OK, let's start doing the work, figure out how to play the songs.'

It was too easy, and we were actually <b>really</b> <b>having</b> a good time together." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} {{is believed to}} have initiated a phenomenon referred to as [...] "The Scully Effect"; as the medical doctor and the FBI Special Agent inspired many young women to pursue careers in science, medicine and law enforcement, and as a result brought a perceptible {{increase in the number of}} women in those fields. At the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con International, Anderson noted that she has long been aware of [...] "The Scully Effect" [...] and stated: [...] "We got a lot of letters all the time, and I was told quite frequently by girls who were going into the medical world or the science world or the FBI world or other worlds that I reigned, that they were pursuing those pursuits because of the character of Scully. And I said, 'Yay!'" [...] Anne Simon, a biology professor and a science adviser for the series recalls: [...] "I asked my Intro Bio class back then how many of them were influenced by the character of Scully on The X-Files to go into science and half of the hands in the room went up. That's huge! That was saying that the show was <b>really</b> <b>having</b> an effect." [...] "The Scully Effect" [...] remains a subject of academic inquiry.|$|E
2500|$|... "Donnie or Marie" [...] {{received}} positive reviews. Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic {{rated the}} episode 4.6 out of 5 stars and [...] "could barely move" [...] {{after watching the}} episode. [...] "There's still a sense of not <b>really</b> <b>having</b> any clue who killed Rosie, which may be extremely obnoxious to some and perfectly riveting to others. But that noir tone has never changed, The characters have remained true to themselves flaws and all, and the case, while at times long winded, in these last few episodes has felt like it's moved somewhere, giving us something to grasp onto and feel as if the answers are within our reach." [...] The A.V. Club's Brandon Nowalk rated this episode a B, calling it a [...] "suspenseful cliffhanger" [...] and comparing the cross-editing to the previous episode [...] "Bulldog" [...] by stating: [...] "The difference is that last week cut between an absorbing dramatic scene and an energetic detective scene while [...] "Donny Or Marie" [...] cuts between two thrilling mysteries surfing each other's wakes. Instead of falling through the dramatic pauses, the momentum carries {{all the way through}} the finale." [...] William Bibbiani of CraveOnline was pleased to see an episode dedicated to the murder investigation. He stated: [...] "I've been saying throughout this season that The Killing would have to really step up its game in the last few episodes to make the last 11 episodes seem like they were worth the trouble, and while 'Donnie or Marie' is certainly a strong one, it's not so revelatory or dramatic that it forgives the failings of the season that precedes it. If every episode of the season was this good, The Killing would have been a much better series. But even then, it would need to really end with a glorified bang to justify the buildup." ...|$|E

60|$|A week later, I met M. Claude again. He was a {{very nice}} young fellow, there was not a doubt of that. He was intelligent, well educated, manly, with all the honest, sturdy, {{independent}} Swiss nature clearly visible in his frank, bright, open face. I have seldom met a man whom I liked better at first sight than M. Claude, and after he had gone away I felt more than a little ashamed of myself to think I had been half trying to steal away Isaline's heart from this good fellow, without <b>really</b> <b>having</b> any deliberate design upon it myself.

Sixteen miles--nay, eighteen--it must be full eighteen to Manchester-street--was a serious obstacle. Were he ever able to get away, the day would be spent in coming and returning.

6000|$|Milly hesitated, for the {{question}} was somehow as the sudden point of something sharp on a nerve that winced. She just caught her breath, but she had ground for joy afterwards, she felt, in not <b>really</b> <b>having</b> failed to choose with quickness sufficient, out of fifteen possible answers, the one that would best serve her. She was then almost proud, as well, that she had cheerfully smiled. [...] "I did--three times--in New York." [...] So came and went for her, in these simple words, the speech that was to figure for her, later on, that night, as {{the one she had}} ever uttered that cost her most. She was to lie awake, at all events, half the night, for the gladness of not having taken any line so really inferior as the denial of a happy impression.|$|E
6000|$|... "I 've {{thought of}} that, and I {{rather like the}} idea; liking, as I do, the man. I told you the other day, you know, that I longed to have {{something}} on my hands.

Then I remembered there were dangers and difficulties, and asked myself whether I had a right to step in between him and his obscurity. My sense of his <b>really</b> <b>having</b> the divine flame answered the question. He is made {{to do the things that}} humanity is the happier for! I can't do such things myself, but when I see a young man of genius standing helpless and hopeless for want of capital, I feel--and it 's no affectation of humility, I assure you--as if it would give at least a reflected usefulness to my own life to offer him his opportunity." ...|$|E
60|$|So Rollo {{began to}} walk about under the portico, or piazza, to the various diligences which {{were getting ready to}} set out on the {{different}} roads. There was one where there was a gentleman and two ladies who were quite in trouble. I suppose that among the girls who may read this book there may be many who may think that it must necessarily be a very agreeable thing to travel about Europe, and that if they could only go,--no matter under what circumstances,--they should experience an almost uninterrupted succession of pleasing sensations. But the truth is, that travelling in Europe, like every other earthly source of pleasure, is very far from being sufficient of itself to confer happiness. Indeed, under almost all the ordinary circumstances in which parties of travellers are placed, the question whether they are to enjoy themselves and be happy on any particular day of their journey, or to be discontented and miserable, depends so much upon little things which they did not at all take into the account, or even foresee at all in planning the journey, that it is wholly uncertain when you look upon a party of travellers that you meet on the road, whether they are <b>really</b> <b>having</b> a good time or not. You cannot tell at all by the outward circumstances.|$|E

60|$|They had plenty, {{on these}} lines, the two elder women, {{to give and}} to take, and it was even not quite clear to the pilgrim from Boston that what she should mainly have {{arranged}} for in London was not a series of thrills for herself. She had a bad conscience, indeed almost a sense of immorality, in having to recognise that she was, as she said, carried away. She laughed to Milly when she also said that she didn't know where it would end; and the principal of her uneasiness was that Mrs. Lowder's life bristled for her with elements that she was <b>really</b> <b>having</b> to look at for the first time. They represented, she believed, the world, the world that, {{as a consequence of}} the cold shoulder turned to it by the Pilgrim Fathers, had never yet boldly crossed to Boston--it would surely have sunk the stoutest Cunarder--and she couldn't pretend that she faced the prospect simply because Milly had had a caprice. She was in the act herself of having one, directed precisely to their present spectacle. She could but seek strength in the thought that she had never had one--or had never yielded to one, which came to the same thing--before. The sustaining sense of it all, moreover, as literary material--that quite dropped from her. She must wait, at any rate, she should see: it struck her, so far as she had got, as vast, obscure, lurid. She reflected in the watches of the night that she was probably just going to love it for itself--that is for itself and Milly. The odd thing was that she could think of Milly's loving it without dread--or with dread, at least not on the score of conscience, only on the score of peace. It was a mercy, at all events, for the hour, that their fancies jumped together.|$|E
6000|$|There was happily {{enough to}} say, on so consecrated a spot, {{that could be}} said freely and fairly; so that a whole train of {{declarations}} was precipitated by his friend's having herself broken out, after a yearning look round: [...] "But I hope you don't mean {{they want you to}} pull this to pieces!" [...] His answer came, promptly, with his re-awakened wrath: it was of course exactly what they wanted, and what they were [...] "at" [...] him for, daily, with the iteration of people who couldn't for their life understand a man's liability to decent feelings. He had found the place, just as it stood and beyond what he could express, an interest and a joy. There were values other than the beastly rent-values, and in short, in short--! But it was thus Miss Staverton took him up. [...] "In short you're to make so good a thing of your sky-scraper that, living in luxury on those ill-gotten gains, you can afford for a while to be sentimental here!" [...] Her smile had for him, with the words, the particular mild irony with which he found half her talk suffused; an irony without bitterness and that came, exactly, from her having so much imagination--not, like the cheap sarcasms with which one heard most people, about the world of [...] "society," [...] bid for the reputation of cleverness, from nobody's <b>really</b> <b>having</b> any. It was agreeable to him at this very moment to be sure that when he had answered, after a brief demur, [...] "Well, yes; so, precisely, you may put it!" [...] her imagination would still do him justice. He explained that even if never a dollar were to come to him from the other house he would nevertheless cherish this one; and he dwelt, further, while they lingered and wandered, on the fact of the stupefaction he was already exciting, the positive mystification he felt himself create.|$|E
6000|$|To {{recognise}} {{the reality}} of the Jewish problem is very vital for everybody and especially vital for Jews. To pretend that there is no problem is to precipitate the expression of a rational impatience, which unfortunately can only express itself in the rather irrational form of Anti-Semitism. In the controversies of Palestine and Syria, for instance, it is very common to hear the answer that the Jew is no worse than the Armenian. The Armenian also is said to be unpopular as a money-lender and a mercantile upstart; yet the Armenian figures as a martyr for the Christian faith and a victim of the Moslem fury. But {{this is one of those}} arguments which really carry their own answer. It is like the sceptical saying that man is only an animal, which of itself provokes the retort, [...] "What an animal!" [...] The very similarity only emphasises the contrast. Is it seriously suggested that we can substitute the Armenian for the Jew in the study of a world-wide problem like that of the Jews? Could we talk of the competition of Armenians among Welsh shop-keepers, or of the crowd of Armenians on Brighton Parade? Can Armenian usury be a common topic of talk in a camp in California and in a club in Piccadilly? Does Shakespeare show us a tragic Armenian towering over the great Venice of the Renascence? Does Dickens show us a realistic Armenian teaching in the thieves' kitchens of the slums? When we meet Mr. Vernon Vavasour, that brilliant financier, do we speculate on the probability of his <b>really</b> <b>having</b> an Armenian name to match his Armenian nose? Is it true, in short, that all sorts of people, from the peasants of Poland to the peasants of Portugal, can agree more or less upon the special subject of Armenia? Obviously it is not in the least true; obviously the Armenian question is only a local question of certain Christians, who may be more avaricious than other Christians. But it is the truth about the Jews. It is only half the truth, and one which by itself would be very unjust to the Jews. But it is the truth, and we must realise it as sharply and clearly as we can. The truth is that it is rather strange that the Jews should be so anxious for international agreements. For one of the few really international agreements is a suspicion of the Jews.|$|E
