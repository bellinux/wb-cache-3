Photoluminescence intensity recorded as a function of excitation power density follows a linear dependence up to a threshold PT that depends on the design of the sample. Above this threshold, the variation of the intensity becomes sublinear, which is characteristic of the onset of Auger recombination processes. After extracting the evolution of IQE with pump power from the experimental data, we use a modified ABC modeling that includes the <b>residual</b> n-type <b>doping</b> to estimate the contribution of different recombination channels.

40|$|The stress {{transfer}} mechanism from a {{polymer substrate}} to a nano-inclusion, {{such as a}} graphene flake, is of extreme interest {{for the production of}} effective nanocomposites. Previous work conducted mainly at the micron scale has shown that the intrinsic mechanism of stress transfer is shear at the interface. However, since the interfacial shear takes its maximum value at {{the very edge of the}} nano-inclusion it is of extreme interest to assess the effect of edge integrity upon axial stress transfer at the submicron scale. Here, we conduct a detailed Raman line mapping near the edges of a monolayer graphene flake which is simply supported onto an epoxy based photoresist (SU 8) /poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix at steps as small as 100 nm. We show for the first time that, the distribution of axial strain (stress) along the flake deviates somewhat from the classical shear-lag prediction for a region of about 2 um from the edge. This behavior is mainly attributed to the presence of <b>residual</b> stresses, unintentional <b>doping</b> and/or edge effects (deviation from the equilibrium values of bond lengths and angles, as well as different edge chiralities). By considering a simple balance of shear-to-normal stresses at the interface we are able to directly convert the strain (stress) gradient to values of interfacial shear stress for all the applied tensile levels without assuming classical shear-lag behavior.

40|$|Silicon carbide (SiC) {{has been}} {{discussed}} as a promising material for high power bipolar devices for almost twenty years. Advances in SiC crystal growth especially the development of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) have enabled the fabrication of high quality material. Much progress has further been achieved in identifying minority charge carrier lifetime limiting defects, which {{may be attributed to}} structural defects, surface recombination or point defects located in the band gap of SiC. Deep levels can act as recombination centers by interacting with both the valence and conduction band. As such, the defect levels reduce the minority charge carrier lifetime, which is of great importance in bipolar devices. Impurities in semiconductors play an important role to adjust their semiconducting properties. Intentional doping can introduce shallow defect levels to increase the conductivity or deep levels for achieving semi-insulating (SI) SiC. Impurities, especially transition metals generate defect levels deep in the band gap of SiC, which trap charge carriers and thus reduce the charge carrier lifetime. Transition metals, such as vanadium, are used in SiC to compensate the <b>residual</b> nitrogen <b>doping.</b> It has previously been reported that valence band edges of the different SiC polytypes are pinned to the same level and that deep levels related to transition metals can serve as a common reference level; this is known as the LANGER-HEINRICH (LH) rule. Electron irradiation introduces or enhances the concentration of existing point defects, such as the carbon vacancy (VC) and the carbon interstitial (Ci). Limiting the irradiation energy, Eirr, below the displacement energy of silicon in the SiC lattice (Eirr < 220 keV), the generated defects can be attributed to carbon related defects, which are already created at lower Eirr. Ci are mobile at low temperatures and using low temperature heat treatments, the annealing behavior of the introduced Ci and their complexes can be studied. Deep levels, which appear and disappear depending on the electrical, thermal and optical conditions prior to the measurements are associated with metastable defects. These defects can exist in more than one configuration, which itself can have different charge states. Capacitance transient investigations, where the defect’s occupation is studied by varying the depletion region in a diode, can be used to observe such occupational changes. Such unstable behavior may influence device performance, since defects may be electrically active in one configuration and inactive after transformation to another configuration. This thesis is focused on electrical characterization of deep levels in SiC using deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS). The first part, papers 1 - 4, is dedicated to defect studies of both impurities and intrinsic defects in as-grown material. The second part, consisting of papers 5 - 7, is dealing with the defect content after electron irradiation and the annealing behavior of the introduced deep levels. In the first part, transition metal incorporation of iron (Fe) and tungsten (W) is discussed in papers 1 and 2, respectively. Fe and W are possible candidates to compensate the <b>residual</b> nitrogen <b>doping</b> in SiC. The doping with Fe resulted in one level in n-type material and two levels in p-type 4 H-SiC. The capture process is strongly coupled to the lattice. Secondary ion mass spectrometry measurements detected the presence of B and Fe. The defects are suggested to be related to Fe and/or Fe-B-pairs. Previous reports on tungsten doping showed that W gives rise to two levels (one shallow and one deep) in 4 H- and only one deep level in 6 H-SiC. In 3 C-SiC, we detected two levels, one likely related to W and one intrinsic defect, labeled E 1. The W related energy level aligns well with the deeper levels observed in 4 H- and 6 H-SiC in agreement with the LH rule. The LH rule is observed from experiments to be also valid for intrinsic levels. The level related to the DLTS peak EH 6 = 7 in 4 H-SiC aligns with the level related to E 7 in 6 H-SiC {{as well as with the}} level related to E 1 in 3 C-SiC. The alignment suggests that these levels may originate from the same defect, probably the VC, which has been proposed previously for 4 H- and 6 H-SiC. In paper 3, electrical characterization of 3 C-layers grown heteroepitaxially on different SiC substrates is discussed. The material was of high quality with a low background doping concentration and SCHOTTKY diodes were fabricated. It was observed that nickel as rectifying contact material exhibits a similar barrier height as the previously suggested gold. A leakage current in the low nA range at a reverse bias of - 2 V was achieved, which allowed capacitance transient measurements. One defect related to DLTS peak E 1, previously presented in paper 2, was detected and suggested to be related to an intrinsic defect. Paper 4 gives the evidence that chloride-based CVD grown material yields the same kind of defects as reported for standard CVD growth processes. However, for very high growth rates, exceeding 100 mm/h, an additional defect is observed as well as an increase of the Ti-concentration. Based on the knowledge from paper 2, the origin of the additional peak and the assumed increase of Ti-concentration can instead both be attributed to the deeper and the shallower level of tungsten in 4 H-SiC, respectively. In the second part of the thesis, studies of low-energy (200 keV) electron irradiated as-grown 4 H-SiC were performed. In paper 5, bistable defects, labeled EB-centers, evolved in the DLTS spectrum after the annihilation of the irradiation induced defect levels related to DLTS peaks EH 1, EH 3 and the bistable M-center. In a detailed annealing study presented in paper 6, the partial transformation of M-centers into the EB-centers is discussed. The transition between the two defects (M-centers → EB-centers) takes place at rather low temperatures (T ≈ 400 oC), which suggests a mobile defect as origin. The M-center and the EB-centers are suggested to be related to Ci and/or Ci complex defects. The EB-centers anneal out at about 700 oC. In paper 7, the DLTS peak EH 5, which is observed after low- and high-energy electron irradiation is presented. The peak is associated with a bistable defect, labeled F-center. Configuration A exists unoccupied and occupied by an electron, whereas configuration B is only stable when filled by an electron. Reconfiguration temperatures for both configurations were determined and the reconfiguration energies were calculated from the transition kinetics. The reconfiguration B→A can also be achieved by minority charge carrier injection. The F-center is likely a carbon related defect, since it is already present after low-energy irradiation...|$|R

Depending on the thickness ratio between InAs and GaSb layers in the SL period, the residual background carriers of this adjustable material can be either n-type or p-type. Using this flexibility in <b>residual</b> <b>doping</b> of the SL material, the p–n junction of the device is made with different non-intentionally doped (nid) SL structures. The SL photodiode processed shows a cut-off wavelength at 4. 65 μm at 77 K, residual carrier concentration equal to 1. 75 × 1015 cm− 3, dark current density as low as 2. 8 × 10 − 8 A/cm 2 at 50 mV reverse bias and R 0 A product as high as 2 × 106 Ω cm 2. The results obtained demonstrate the possibility to fabricate a SL pin photodiode without intentional doping the pn junction...|$|E
