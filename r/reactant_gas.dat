40|$|The solid {{oxide fuel}} cell (SOFC) is an {{electrochemical}} device that converts the chemical energy present in reactant fuels into electrical energy and heat. Such conversion {{is given by}} the electrochemical reactions that occur inside the fuel cells when the <b>reactant</b> <b>gases</b> reach the so-called Three-phase Boundary (TPB). However, before the <b>reactant</b> <b>gases</b> can reach the TPBs, they have to pass through an anisotropic layered material in which the fluid behavior {{is not easy to}} explain. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to obtain a detailed behavior of the fluid flow through a modeled SOFC anode with gradient porosity using the Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). Three different modeled SOFC anodes are analyzed keeping the porosity as a constant value, but varying the void space distribution in the flow direction. Results show that the an decreasing porosity in the flow direction can offer more possibilities for <b>reactant</b> <b>gases</b> to get easily the TPB; and therefore, the reaction rate during the electrochemical reactions can be increased...|$|R

Although there are many computational models in literature that describe the behavior of Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cell, there is a only few models that simulates the catalyst surface concentration of <b>reactant</b> <b>gases</b> at the catalyst-membrane layer inteface. A modeling of a PEM fuel cell is presented to determine both the bulk reactant concentrations and the catalyst surface concentrations at the catalyst layer-membrane layer interface. The {{results suggest that the}} reactant deficiencies experienced at high current densities are localized to the catalyst surface. However, the bulk concentration of reactant is not zero, and, in most cases, the bulk concentration of the <b>reactant</b> <b>gases</b> is significantly greater than zero. In actuality, it is the catalyst surface, which is being depleted of reactant, and, at the limiting current density, the surface concentrations of <b>reactant</b> <b>gases</b> are zero.

Some of those features are low start-up, high power density, high efficiency and remote applications. In the present study, a numerical investigation was conducted to analyse the flow field and <b>reactant</b> <b>gas</b> distribution in a PEM fuel cell channel with transversely inserted pin fins in the channel flow aimed at improving <b>reactant</b> <b>gas</b> distribution. A fin configuration of small hydraulic diameter was employed to minimise the additional pressure drop.

The parameters examined were optimized using a mathematical optimization code integrated with a commercial computational fluid dynamics code.
