25|$|Bill C-38 entered <b>Report</b> <b>Stage</b> on June 16, 2005.

25|$|The {{bill was}} {{examined}} in 13 sittings by the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill Committee, a public bill committee established to scrutinise the bill line by line. The bill completed its committee stage on 12 March 2013 and had its <b>report</b> <b>stage</b> in the House of Commons on 20–21 May 2013. The third reading {{took place on}} 21 May, and was approved by 366 votes to 161, with the bill receiving its first reading in the House of Lords the same evening.|$|E
2500|$|The {{government}} lost {{divisions in}} the House of Lords at <b>Report</b> <b>Stage</b> on the exclusion of Wilmslow and Poynton from Greater Manchester and their retention in Cheshire, and also on whether Rothwell should form part of the Leeds or Wakefield districts. (Rothwell had been planned for Wakefield, but an amendment at <b>report</b> <b>stage</b> was proposed by local MP Albert Roberts and accepted by the government. [...] This was overturned by the Lords.) Instead, the Wakefield district gained the town of Ossett, which was originally placed in the Kirklees district, following an appeal by Ossett Labour Party.|$|E

However, a high test-retest reliability estimate (. 91) was obtained from a sample of 525  K- 12 teachers from a metropolitan north Texas public school district during August 1999. A Pearson product-moment correlation was calculated between the two <b>reported</b> <b>Stage</b> measures {{as a form of}} test-retest reliability.

All of these sittings (including Committee stage) took place on the floor of the House and ten votes for various amendments.|$|E

Lord Annan, author of the 1977 Report of the Committee on the Future of Broadcasting, spoke in defence of Radio Caroline in the House of Lords at <b>report</b> <b>stage</b> on the Broadcasting Act 1990, saying [...] "Why break a butterfly upon the wheel?" [...] In a 1995 article for the pressure group Charter88, Steve McGann commented: [...] "Whether Caroline was right to maintain her defiance {{for so many years}} is irrelevant. Her story illustrates how uniquely dangerous government regards an independent voice transmitted over unrestricted airwaves and to what ends it will go to silence it." [...] This legislation remains in force.|$|E
2500|$|June 15, 2005 - It is {{appearing}} {{less likely}} {{the bill will}} be out of 3rd reading stage by the time MPs recess from the summer on June 23 (unless sittings area extended) due to Conservatives stalling the budget bill (C-48), and the Government wants to deal with C-48 before C-38. The Government can invoke closure and force a vote on C-38 immediately, but it seems unlikely to happen since even the Liberal Government has disgruntled MPs against C-38 [...] that want more debate now that the committee has reported. Weeks ago, Pat O'Brien left the Liberal caucus over the same-sex marriage legislation, that he felt was being rushed through the Commons. Cotler says the Government is where they expected to be which is now at <b>Report</b> <b>Stage</b> and that although he wants to see the legislation passed by the summer, he's only the Minister of Justice.|$|E
50|$|The bill's {{first reading}} in the House of Commons was made on 19 June 2013.

It then progressed through its Committee and <b>Report</b> <b>Stages</b> between July and November 2013 and finally cleared the Commons in November 2013.|$|R
40|$|We used a {{simulation}} methodology {{to provide a}} direct measurement of how incidents and accidents are investigated. Thirty-seven aviation maintenance personnel with incident investigation experience investigated are six incident scenarios that we developed from actual maintenance incidents. Using a methodology developed by Woodcock and Smiley (1999), participants were given a brief incident description and had to question the experimenter {{to determine how the}} incident happened. We counted the number and types of information requests, and recorded their sequence. Based on the sequence data we propose a five-stage model of incident investigation. An initial trigger initiates an interactive data collection/ data analysis period, starting by determining spatial and temporal boundaries then investigating in a somewhat sequential manner. A stopping rule is used to determine when to stop investigating and begin the final <b>reporting</b> <b>stage.</b> The number of facts considered grows during the investigation stage, but then decreases at the <b>reporting</b> <b>stage.</b> Thus, basing recommendations on the reports of incidents may not consider all causal factors...|$|R

60|$|What Mr. Gladstone called 'the evil of {{parliamentary}} interference' did not tarry, {{and on the}} <b>report</b> <b>stage</b> of the bill, a clause removing the theological test at matriculation was carried (June 22) against the government by ninety-one. The size of the majority and the diversified material of which it was composed left the government {{no option but to}} yield. 'Parliament having now unhappily determined to legislate upon the subject,' Mr. Gladstone writes to the provost of Oriel, 'it seems to me, I may add it seems to my colleagues, best for the interests of the university that we should now make some endeavour to settle the whole question and so preclude, if we can, any pretext for renewed agitation.' 'The basis of that settlement,' he went on in a formula which he tenaciously reiterated to all his correspondents, and which is a landmark in the long history of his dealing with the question, 'should be that the whole teaching and governing function in the university and in the colleges, halls, and private halls, should be retained, as now, in the church of England, but that everything outside the governing and teaching functions, whether in the way of degrees, honours, or emoluments, should be left open.' The new clause he described as 'one of those incomplete arrangements that seem to suit the practical habits of this country, and which by taking the edge off a matter of complaint, are often found virtually to dispose of it for a length of time.' In the end the church of England test was removed, not only on admission to the university, but from the bachelor's degree. Tests in other forms remained, as we shall in good time perceive. 'We have proceeded,' Mr. Gladstone wrote, 'in the full belief that the means of applying a church test to fellowships in colleges are clear and ample.' So they were, and so remained, until seventeen years later in the life of an administration of his own the obnoxious fetter was struck off.|$|E

50|$|At the bill's <b>report</b> <b>stage,</b> 165 {{amendments}} were proposed.

30|$|This review has {{described}} the typical patterns of tumour spread for the more common cancers occurring within the abdomen and pelvis. Sites of nodal and haematogenous dissemination clearly vary depending on tumour type. Knowledge of the characteristic sites of spread in such cancers is felt to be essential for the radiologist when <b>reporting</b> <b>staging</b> and restaging CT scans. It is hoped that the summary tables in particular will act as a useful aide-mémoir to the reporting radiologist. Correct identification of metastatic sites of disease is important, as this will not only {{have an impact on}} patient management, but also a bearing on patient prognosis.|$|R
30|$|Thus, the {{performance}} evaluation {{function of the}} divisional manager {{is equal to the}} local profit plus the transferred amount multiplied by the transfer price. In a more general case, this is equal to the local profit plus the expected profit of the other division (the relevant part marked by a*) or rather the expected profit of the entire company. At the <b>reporting</b> <b>stage,</b> it is rather obvious that both of the divisions are interested in sending a report which leads to maximizing the total expected profit rather than the local profit as in the classical Hirshleifer setting. In fact, it is a Nash equilibrium to report truthfully about the production schedules.|$|R
