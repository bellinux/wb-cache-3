5|$|Dunball wharf {{was built}} in 1844 by Bridgwater coal merchants, and was {{formerly}} linked to the Bristol and Exeter Railway by a <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> which crossed the A38. In 1875, the local landowner built The Dunball Steam Pottery & Brick & Tile Works adjacent to the wharf.|$|E

40|$|Construction of <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> {{requires}} appropriate improvement {{techniques for}} ballast and underlying soft formation soil, {{both of which}} deform and degrade progressively under heavy train loads. This paper aims to demonstrate and discuss some major aspects in relation to stabilisation of ballasted <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> overlaying soft formation soils. The use of geocomposites (i. e. bonded geogrid-geotextile layers) for enhancing the performance of <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> is described, {{with the aim of}} achieving reduced track settlement, increased resilient modulus and decreased ballast degradation. The effects of increasing the confining pressure on <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> in regard to particle breakage are studied using laboratory tests. The utilization of prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) to improve soft subgrade and provide better drainage system is introduced. Finite element analysis using an equivalent plane strain conversion is employed to predict settlements, excess pore pressures and lateral displacements under <b>rail</b> <b>tracks.</b> Finally, the use of native vegetation to stabilise soft formations of <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> is discussed, with the aid of preliminary suction models based on evapotranspiration mechanics applied to tree roots...|$|R

50|$|According to the Philadelphia City Planning Commission, {{the main}} {{boundaries}} for the Overbrook neighborhood are North 63rd Street to the west, Lansdowne Avenue to the south, and the SEPTA regional <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> to the northeast. A very {{small portion of}} Woodbine Avenue between North 63rd Street and the SEPTA regional <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> bounds Overbrook to the north while a very small portion of North 52nd Street between Lansdowne Avenue and the SEPTA regional <b>rail</b> <b>tracks</b> bounds Overbrook to the south.|$|R
5|$|Located on {{the south}} bank of the Chicago River, the park {{is divided into three}} {{sections}} by a Santa Fe <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> and 18th Street. Currently, only development in the area south of 18th Street has been completed. It was designed by Ernest C. Wong of Site Design Group and features a pagoda-style pavilion, bamboo gardens, and a playground. The park is named in honor of prominent Chinatown businessman and civic leader Ping Tom; a bronze bust of Tom is installed near the park's pavilion.|$|E
5|$|The A. sp. was {{discovered}} in 2007. It {{was found in the}} course of the construction of a high-speed <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> connecting Madrid with Valencia, in a fossil site that many animals were found in, in the Villalba de la Sierra Formation. The site was at a locality named “Lo Hueco,” near the village of Fuentes, Castile-La Mancha, Spain. Over the course of several months, a large-scale emergency excavation by over 60 paleontologists and 100 manual workers allowed thousands of specimens of plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates of late Campanian-early Maastrichtian age to be saved, including A. sp.|$|E
5|$|Railway traffic {{throughout}} the state was paralyzed, as some train bridges collapsed, and extensive damage {{was found in the}} track ballast in multiple rail lines. Kansas City Southern Railway reported it expected a net loss of five cents per share on its annual earnings due to the stoppage affecting its Mexican subsidiary. The company later reported a drop of $33 million (2010 USD) in revenue due to hurricane damage. The damage to the railway infrastructure caused automotive part shortages throughout North America. General Motors was forced to cancel shifts at plants in Michigan, Missouri and Kansas. Ford also idled production in its Oakville, Ontario assembly plant, and suffered two-week delays in U.S. deliveries of its Fiesta model due to the <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> damage. The damage to the road system paralyzed a route used by 40% of the trade between the United States and Mexico, as 22,000 trucks were stalled after damage to the Nuevo LaredoMonterrey highway.|$|E

5|$|CR492 intersects M-35 near Eagle Mills Location. M-35 {{approaches}} the county {{road from the}} north before it turns east to run concurrently with CR492. The two roadway designations cross a <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> before M-35 separates and turns south; traffic along the state highway must yield the right-of-way to traffic on the county road in the process. Eagle Mills is {{the location of the}} main LS rail yard and the former Pioneer Pellet Plant. CR492 curves away from this industrial area to the northeast. The roadway crosses Morgan Creek and enters the Morgan Heights area on the border of Negaunee Township and Marquette Township. This is the site of the first tuberculosis sanatorium in the Upper Peninsula built in 1911; the facility {{is said to have been}} haunted before the main buildings were torn down around 2002. The road continues east through forested lands in Marquette Township, rounding Dead Man's Curve and running downhill into the Morgan Meadows area. CR492 passes a convent of the Sisters of St. Paul de Chartres before entering a residential area. The road curves north past these subdivisions, meeting the western end of CR500 (Grove Street). Further north, CR492 intersects Brookton Road before the southern segment terminates at US41/M-28 in the middle of Marquette Township's commercial corridor.|$|E
