Most applied research on metaheuristics has focused on static (non-changing) opti-mization problems and these methods often lack from adap-tation strategies.

As particular examples, two different effective algorithms, named Path Relinking Particle Filter (PRPF) and Scatter Search Particle Filter (SSPF) are <b>respectively</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> the proposed hybridization method.
