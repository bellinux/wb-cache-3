The NPR executives were misled that they would be meeting with representatives of a self-described Muslim group, Muslim Education Action Center (MEAC), that wished to donate money to NPR, [...] "partly out of concern for the defunding process the <b>Republicans</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> engage in." [...] On the recording, Schiller indicates that he is sharing his personal point of view, not NPR’s, saying he'll [...] "talk personally, as opposed to wearing my NPR hat"; then he contrasted the fiscally conservative Republican party of old that didn't get involved in people's personal and family lives with [...] "the current Republican Party, particularly the Tea Party, that is fanatically involved in people's personal lives and very fundamental Christian—I wouldn't even call it Christian. It's this weird evangelical kind of move." [...] Schiller said some highly placed Republicans believed the Republican Party had been hijacked by this radical group, and characterized them as [...] "Islamophobic" [...] and [...] "seriously racist, racist people". Later in the recording, Schiller said he believes NPR [...] "would be better off in the long run without federal funding, and the challenge right now is that we'd have a lot of stations go dark", explaining that removal of federal funding would allow NPR more independence, and remove the widely held misconception that NPR is significantly funded by the public. Subsequent analysis of the raw videos showed that the clips were heavily edited to present only one point of view, and that much of the context of the conversation was changed.|$|E

While the <b>republicans</b> of 1848 <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> solve the constitutional question, he observed, Louis Napoleon realized that the social question was the most important one. Parliamentarism, with its conflicting political parties and class struggles, was incapable of solving the social question. Only a dictatorship with a social outlook, in the view of Napoleon, could solve it. His great aim was to establish a political system based upon the unity of all classes and of all interests in France. It was Napoleon, according to Bremer, who first created the new type of state in the form of authoritarian, plebiscitarian leadership."

5000|$|When Will starts {{working for}} the White House, Josh and Will develop a working {{friendship}} and Josh is not initially angered by Will's defection {{to work with the}} Vice President. Will acknowledges Josh as [...] "the finest mind in the Democratic Party," [...] second only to Leo McGarry, and as such lobbies Josh to run the campaign of the newly minted Vice President, Bob Russell. As Will puts it, he wants Josh to make Russell a candidate that America would vote for, and when the Vice President wins, the two can work together to make him a worthy President. Josh turns down the offer, but the two work together to stop what Josh views as a faulty Patients' Bill of Rights that the <b>Republican</b> Congress <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> pass. Will <b>is</b> also against the bill, mainly because it is an issue that he wishes to address in the Russell campaign. It is through working against the bill that Josh realizes how politically savvy Congressman Matt Santos is, which leads to Josh picking him as his [...] "fantasy candidate" [...] for the presidency several episodes later. The relationship between Josh and Will becomes considerably antagonistic during the 2006 primaries when Josh becomes Santos' campaign manager in his run for the Democratic nomination, thus making him Russell's opponent in the primaries. Will can't understand why Josh would pour his political talent into backing a candidate with little chance of success, while Josh questions Will's integrity, both for backing an unworthy candidate and for his methods. The tension between the two eventually comes to a head at the Democratic National Convention, where Santos ultimately triumphs and is nominated. Despite the tough politicking between the two, their aggression disappears once Santos is nominated. Following the nomination of Santos, the two are seen drinking beers together in the backroom of the convention.|$|R
5000|$|From {{the end of}} World War II, Indonesian <b>republicans</b> had <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> secure Indonesian {{independence}} from Dutch colonial control. From 16-25 July 1946, the Dutch organised a conference {{in the town of}} Malino on Celebes (Sulawesi) as part of their attempt to arrange a federal solution for Indonesia. The Malino Conference resulted in plans for a state in Borneo and another for East Indonesia (then called the [...] "Great East"), areas where the Dutch held both de facto and de jure control. [...] Later that year, the unilaterally declared Republic of Indonesia agreed to the principle of a federal Indonesia with the Linggadjati Agreement of 15 November. [...] The Denpasar Conference of 18-24 December was held to work out the specifics of a state to be called the State of the Great East (Negara Timoer Besar). [...] That state was established on 24 December and, on 27 December, renamed the State of East Indonesia (Negara Indonesia Timoer or NIT which some opponents joked stood for negara ikoet toean or [...] "state which goes along with the master", i.e. the Dutch). With the realisation of the United States of Indonesia on 27 December 1949, East Indonesia became a constituent of the new federation. In much of Indonesia, the federal USI was seen as an illegitimate regime foisted on the islands by the Dutch, and many of the federal states began to merge with the Republic of Indonesia. However many in East Indonesia, with its non-Javanese population and greater number of Christians, opposed moves toward a unitary state. East Indonesia had already dealt with the [...] "Twelfth Province" [...] secessionist movement in Minahasa in 1948. The formation of East Indonesia's last cabinet in May 1950 with the intention of dissolving the state into the Republic of Indonesia led to open rebellion in the largely Christian Moluccas and the proclamation of an independent Republic of the South Moluccas (RMS). [...] The USI was dissolved on 17 August 1950 and the rebellion in the Moluccas was crushed in November of the same year.|$|R

The measures were hotly contested in the state legislature, passing on a party-line vote, with Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed. This measure prompted two federal lawsuits. The first lawsuit, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio on behalf of the NAACP and League of Women Voters of Ohio, resulted in a settlement in April 2015, in which the state agreed to provide evening and Sunday hours for early voting in elections in Ohio through 2018. The second lawsuit, Ohio Democratic Party v. Husted, was brought in May 2015 by Democratic election lawyer Marc Elias; plaintiffs argued that the Ohio bill eliminating [...] "golden week" [...] violated the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act because it disproportionately burdened black, Latino and young voters. The federal district court agreed and struck down the legislation, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed that decision in a 2-1 vote, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal. In July 2015, Kasich said that it was [...] "pure demagoguery" [...] for Hillary Clinton to [...] "say that there <b>are</b> <b>Republicans</b> who <b>are</b> deliberately <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> keep people from voting." [...] In April 2015, Kasich used his line-item veto power to veto a provision added to a highway-budget bill by Republicans in the state legislature that would have required college students who register to vote in Ohio to obtain a state driver's license and vehicle registration, imposing an estimated $75 in motor vehicle costs on out-of-state college students who wanted to vote in the state. The veto was celebrated by voting rights advocates, Ohio Democrats, and the Cleveland Plain Dealer editorial board, which viewed the proposal as effectively a [...] "poll tax" [...] motivated by a partisan desire to limit college-town voting.|$|R
40|$|Between 1750 and 1861 in Italy, {{the term}} ‘democracy’ {{underwent}} a crucial change in meaning and in use. This change affected both {{the perception of}} democracy as a political model and {{as a form of}} government as well as the value assigned therein. In the space of a century, at least three different phases can be singled out in the relationship existing between Italian political thought and the democratic experience seen as a whole in historical and theoretical terms. Between 1750 and 1790 the word ‘democracy’ was prevalently used, for better or worse, in reference to classical antiquity and the relevant term was really ‘republic’: a <b>republican</b> ideal <b>was</b> slowly <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> free itself from its aristocratic features to adapt to the modern commercial society and to a more egalitarian and individualist concept. Beginning in 1790, probably with the help of Edmund Burke’s invectives against the French Revolution, the term democracy began to be used, above all by adversaries, with a prevalently negative connotation and precisely in reference to the developments of the above mentioned event. This use was reinforced when the Jacobins took possession of the term and matched it with a model that was to end tragically with the ‘Terror’, but would not cease to hold great charm for its Italian supporters, up to and beyond the conclusion of the Revolutionary Triennium in 1799. This mirror-like choice of the same term by opposing political positions, radical and reactionary, lasted until 1835 and throughout those years caused the moderate supporters of democratic reforms to rely on the concept of ‘representative government’ instead. It was Tocqueville’s masterpiece on America, published in the same year, that permanently reintroduced democracy at the centre of the Euro-Atlantic debate, whether conceived as a form of government or as a ‘social state’. In Italy, the term ‘democracy’ therefore began to acquire a number of different shades of meanings with liberal to socialist variants. However, particularly after 1848, the term became a given essential in the process of national Unification, which ended in 1861...|$|R
