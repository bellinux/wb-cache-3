5|$|In {{the video}} game Halo 2 (2004), {{a member of the}} Covenant Prophet triumvirate, <b>Regret,</b> arrives at Earth with a fleet. Most of his fleet is destroyed; Regret's ship flees to another ring, Delta Halo, and is {{followed}} by the human ship In Amber Clad and the Master Chief aboard her. The Chief kills <b>Regret</b> before the majority of the Covenant fleet arrives at Delta Halo, along with the Covenant's holy city of High Charity. The death of <b>Regret</b> leads the remaining Prophets to promote the Brutes as their guards, replacing the Elites. The Elites, outraged, threaten to resign from the Covenant high council; in turn the Prophets give the Brutes carte blanche to kill the Elites, sparking a civil war. In the midst of these developments, the Flood are again released; the High Prophet Mercy is killed by the parasite, while the last remaining leader, Truth, flees to Earth in a Forerunner ship, entrusting the activation of Halo to the Brute Tartarus. The Elites ally with the humans of In Amber Clad to stop the firing of the ring, but inadvertently set all the remaining Halo rings to be remotely activated from a location known as the Ark, placed outside the range of the Halo Array to protect certain species from the firing of the Halo rings, built as a foundry for the rings including replacing any that get destroyed.|$|E
