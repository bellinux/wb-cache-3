This work includes the design and estimates of continuous <b>R.</b> <b>C.</b> C. beams and continuous pre-stressed concrete beams of various spans. In today’s jet age, we have a host of construction techniques at our disposal. Steel structures, <b>R.</b> <b>C.</b> C.

At times this choice available leads to confusion. The best way is to select the type of construction, depending on the circumstances and type of structure. The aim {{of this paper is}} to design medium span continuous <b>R.</b> <b>C.</b> C. beams as well as continuous pre-stressed concrete variety and then compare the results. Programming in MS EXCEL is done to design the beams. The idea is to reach a definite conclusion regarding the superiority of the two techniques over one another.

40|$|The {{effect of}} rapidly {{lowering}} bathing solution temperature from 36. 5 +/- 0. 5 degrees C to various low temperatures was examined in guinea-pig ventricular muscle {{to explore the}} possible role of intracellular Ca 2 + store sites in excitation-contraction coupling. Rapid cooling from 36. 5 +/- 0. 5 degrees C to below 18 degrees C caused contracture (rapid cooling contracture, <b>r.</b> <b>c.</b> c.) with subthreshold depolarization for contraction, if electrical stimulation was applied before cooling. <b>R.</b> <b>c.</b> c. peak tension depended on cooling temperature, and pre-cooling stimulation frequency and duration. <b>R.</b> <b>c.</b> c. induced after pre-cooling stimulation was enhanced by increased extracellular Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]o) and decreased by reduction of [Ca 2 +]o. Co 2 + (2 - 4 mM) added to the HEPES-buffered Krebs solution, which suppressed the action potential plateau and inhibited twitch response, did not abolish <b>r.</b> <b>c.</b> c. after pre-cooling stimulation at high frequency. Reduction of extracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]o) before cooling enhanced <b>r.</b> <b>c.</b> c., and even in non-stimulated preparations, incubation in low [Na+]o below 68. 8 mM for 20 min produced <b>r.</b> <b>c.</b> <b>c.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>c.</b> c. was superimposed on the tonic component of the K+ contracture, after a quiescent preparation has been depolarized beyond - 40 mV by addition of solid KCl to normal Krebs solution. The relation between <b>r.</b> <b>c.</b> c. tension and membrane potential was shifted to the left along the voltage axis by reducing [Na+]o and shifted to the right by decreasing [Ca 2 +]o. Results suggest that well-developed intracellular Ca 2 + store sites could sequester enough Ca 2 + to generate tension by an energy-dependent process which had been loaded mainly by a voltage-dependent Na+-Ca 2 + exchange mechanism and Ca 2 + current, and that rapid cooling could cause Ca 2 + release from the intracellular store sites with little contribution to membrane excitation in the guinea-pig ventricular muscle...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{majority}} of COL 2 A 1 missense mutations are substitutions of obligatory glycine residues in the triple helical domain. Only a few non-glycine missense mutations {{have been reported}} and among these, the arginine to cysteine substitutions predominate. Objective: To investigate in more detail the phenotype resulting from arginine to cysteine mutations in the COL 2 A 1 gene. Methods: The clinical and radiographic phenotype of all patients in whom an arginine to cysteine mutation in the COL 2 A 1 gene was identified in our laboratory, was studied and correlated with the abnormal genotype. The COL 2 A 1 genotyping involved DHPLC analysis with subsequent sequencing of the abnormal fragments. Results: Six different mutations (<b>R</b> 75 <b>C,</b> <b>R</b> 365 <b>C,</b> <b>R</b> 519 <b>C,</b> <b>R</b> 704 <b>C,</b> <b>R</b> 789 <b>C,</b> <b>R</b> 1076 <b>C)</b> were found in 11 unrelated probands. Each mutation resulted in a rather constant and site-specific phenotype, but a perinatally lethal disorder was never observed. Spondyloarthropathy with normal stature and no ocular involvement were features of patients with the <b>R</b> 75 <b>C,</b> <b>R</b> 519 <b>C,</b> or <b>R</b> 1076 <b>C</b> mutation. Short third and/or fourth toes was a distinguishing feature of the <b>R</b> 75 <b>C</b> mutation and brachydactyly with enlarged finger joints a key feature of the <b>R</b> 1076 <b>C</b> substitution. Stickler dysplasia with brachydactyly was observed in patients with the <b>R</b> 704 <b>C</b> mutation. The <b>R</b> 365 <b>C</b> and <b>R</b> 789 <b>C</b> mutations resulted in classic Stickler dysplasia and spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC), respectively. Conclusions: Arginine to cysteine mutations are rather infrequent COL 2 A 1 mutations which cause a spectrum of phenotypes including classic SEDC and Stickler dysplasia, but also some unusual entities {{that have not yet}} been recognised and described as type II collagenopathies.
