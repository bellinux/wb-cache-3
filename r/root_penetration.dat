This paper presents a rigorous numerical model that simulates the saturated and unsaturated flow through fine­-grained soils (clays) that contain micro-pores and macro-pores. Micro-pores are the pores where liquid can move vertically downwards as well as upwards due to capillary action and due to evaporative gradients. Macro-pores are large inter-clod voids, desiccation cracks, <b>root</b> <b>penetrations,</b> and other large size voids where water can only move downward due to gravity. Groundwater recharge from vadoze zone and solute or contaminant transport within vadoze zone and into the saturated aquifer is controlled by macro as well as micro pores.

The influence of vertical distribution of soil Ninorg on root distribution and capacity for depletion of soil Ninorg was much less than the effect of inherent differences between species.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 The incitant of Verticillium wilt of {{peppermint}} (Verticillium dahliae Kleb.) causes disease symptoms {{only in the}} genera Mentha (the mints) and Monarda. This fungus {{is unable}} to grow saprophytically through natural soil. V. dahliae survives in soil by colonizing and forming microsclerotia in susceptible plants, living root tissue of many resistant plants, and, to a limited extent, non-living plant residues. Fluctuations in populations of V. dahliae in the rhizosphere and <b>penetration</b> of the <b>roots</b> of host and non-host plants were studied in the greenhouse. Rhizosphere soil was collected from plants and diluted into ethanol-streptomycin agar (ESA) by standard soil dilution techniques. Rhizosphere soils from all plants tested had significantly higher populations of V. dahliae than did non-rhizosphere soils. V. dahliae populations in non-rhizosphere soil always remained relatively stable over an eight week period. Resistant and susceptible mint species supported in the rhizosphere, indicating that similar populations of V. dahliae susceptible mint species do not selectively stimulate the pathogen near the root surface. Tomato, a symptomless host of the mint strain of V. dahliae, also supported large populations of V. dahliae in the rhizosphere, but plants such as wheat, corn, and beans (non-hosts) tended to support fewer numbers of Verticillium propagules in the rhizosphere than host plants. Roots from the rhizosphere test plants were thoroughly washed, coarsely chopped, placed in petri dishes, and covered with ESA to determine relative numbers of <b>root</b> <b>penetrations.</b> There were {{no statistically significant differences}} in numbers of <b>root</b> <b>penetrations</b> between resistant and susceptible mint species, but if roots were finely fragmented to release the contents of the vascular system, many more V. dahliae propagules were recovered from susceptible mint roots than from resistant mint roots. of susceptible mints were invaded to a much those of resistant mints.

The vascular systems greater extent than and non-host plants had resistant or susceptible Three mint species of low, medium, and high resistance were grown in field soil infested with 10, 100, and 1000 V. dahliae microsclerotia per gram of soil. Susceptible Mentha piperita L. exhibited severe disease symptoms at all inoculum density levels. Symptoms on moderately resistant Hybrid 88 - 148 increased from mild to moderate to severe with each increase in inoculum density. Resistant M. crispa L. showed only mild to moderate symptoms at all inoculum density levels. However, yields were drastically reduced in all species at the lowest inoculum density compared to non-infested controls. Higher levels of inoculum density reduced yields still more, {{but not as much as}} the low inoculum density, which was the most critical level of infestation for yield reduction. Soil assays after two years' cropping showed that V. dahliae populations increased over the original level of infestation only at the low inoculum density, regardless of the mint species grown. The amount of increase in V. dahliae populations was correlated with susceptibility. Soil assays after a six month fallow period showed that increases in V, dahliae populations at the low inoculum density were temporary; all plots had populations lower than the original level of infestation. Susceptible indicator plants were grown in all plots after the fallow period to measure inoculum potential. Disease symptoms and reductions in yields were unusually severe in low inoculum density plots on which susceptible M. piperita was originally grown. The susceptible mint apparently maintained a higher inoculum potential at the low inoculum density than did resistant species...|$|R

40|$|Soil {{compaction}} is {{a worldwide}} problem in modern agriculture associated with overuse of heavy machinery and intensification of cropping systems. Though tillage is traditionally used to alleviate compaction effect, increasing concerns about {{environmental impacts of}} tillage have led to interest in conservational tillage systems and incorporation of cover crops into crop rotations.

However, {{this study did not}} provide any quantitative data to support the observational conclusion. We studied "biodrilling" abilities of three cover crops and the effects of "biodrilling" on corn (Zea mays) /soybean growth by conducting three experiments.

The third experiment was conducted on field with a legacy plowpan (subsoil compaction) using FR, rye and NC cover crops. Roots of FR were least inhibited by compaction, while rye roots were severely arrested by compaction. The order of "biodrilling" ability was FR > rape > rye.

In a previous report, we analyzed the effect of 5 -azacytidine (5 azaC) on the pathogenicity of F. oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum strain F 9 (Akiyama et al. 1997). This cytidine analogue is an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase (for review, see Santi et al. 1983), and it causes demethylation of DNA and heritable alteration of gene expression in various biological system...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{hybridization}} {{with the}} cloned nodulation region of Rhizobium meliloti as a probe revealed DNA homology with four HindIII fragments, 12. 5, 6. 8, 5. 2, and 0. 3 kilobases (kb) in size, of the symbiotic plasmid pRjaUSDA 193. Both hybridization and complementation {{studies suggest that}} the common nodulation genes nodABC and nodD of R. fredii USDA 193 are present on the 5. 2 -kb HindIII and 2. 8 -kb EcoRI fragments, respectively, of the Sym plasmid. Both fragments together could confer nodulation ability on soybeans when present in Sym plasmid-cured (Sym-) and wild-type (Sym+) Rhizobium strains or in a Ti plasmid-cured Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain. Furthermore, the 2. 8 -kb EcoRI fragment alone was able to form nodulelike structures on Glycine max L. cv. "Peking" (soybean). Microscopic examination of these nodules revealed bacterial invasion of the cells, probably via <b>root</b> hair <b>penetration.</b> Bacterial strains harboring plasmids carrying the 5. 2 - and 2. 8 -kb nod fragments elicited root-hair-curling responses on infection. These data suggest that the genes responsible for host range determination and some of the early events of nodulation may be coded for by the 5. 2 -kb HindIII and 2. 8 -kb EcoRI fragments...|$|R
