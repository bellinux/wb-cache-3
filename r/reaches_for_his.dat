5|$|Despite Pauline's pleas {{that the}} duel is a trap, Silence stands outside the saloon. A killer shoots his left hand, greatly {{impairing}} his speed and marksmanship.

Loco fires at Silence's head, killing him. Distraught, Pauline attempts to shoot Loco herself, but swiftly dies as well. The bounty killers turn their guns on the outlaws, massacring the entire group. As Loco and his men prepare to collect their bounties, he takes Silence's Mauser from Pauline's hands. The killers ride out of Snow Hill into the morning sun. A title card explains that Loco's actions resulted in public condemnation of bounty killing, and a memorial was erected in Snow Hill to honor those who died by his greed.|$|E

There could be no two meanings to that look. It said, as clearly as if he had shouted it, that this was no accidental meeting; that he had tracked her down and proposed to resume matters at the point where they had left off.|$|E
6000|$|... "Take your time," [...] he was saying. [...] "You've got 'm, {{but you got}} to {{take your}} time. I've seen 'm fight. He's got a punch {{to the end of the}} count.

5000|$|Antonello da Messina's Madonna and Child is superficially {{very like}} that of Verrocchio, but it is much less formal and both {{the mother and the}} child appear to be moving rather than posing for the painter.
