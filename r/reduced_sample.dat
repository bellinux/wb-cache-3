5000|$|Sample rate {{reduction}} (also called down-sampling) intentionally reduces the sample rate to degrade {{the quality of}} the audio. As the sample rate is reduced, high frequencies are aliased or, if the digital signal is first low-pass filtered, they are lost. If a primitive step-wave DAC is used, or if the DAC filter cutoff frequency is not adjustable to track with the sample rate, but instead is fixed at half the Nyquist frequency for the maximum supported sample rate, then waveforms also become more [...] "coarse" [...] sounding. At extreme reductions, the waveform becomes metallic sounding as a result of severe aliasing and perhaps nonlinear distortion from poorly tuned digital-to-analog conversion. (Note that all of these effects are avoidable if the signal is low-pass filtered before being downsampled and if the DAC parameters for playback are proper to the <b>reduced</b> <b>sample</b> rate; then the waveform just sounds band-limited like a telephone, an AM radio with clear reception, or a magnetic tape recorder at a slow tape speed.) ...|$|E
50|$|For a doubly doped {{lithium niobate}} (LiNbO3) crystal there exists an optimum oxidation/reduction state for desired performance. This optimum {{depends on the}} doping levels of shallow and deep traps {{as well as the}} {{annealing}} conditions for the crystal samples. This optimum state generally occurs when 95 - 98% of the deep traps are filled. In a strongly oxidized sample holograms cannot be easily recorded and the diffraction efficiency is very low. This is because the shallow trap is completely empty and the deep trap is also almost devoid of electrons. In a highly <b>reduced</b> <b>sample</b> on the other hand, the deep traps are completely filled and the shallow traps are also partially filled. This results in very good sensitivity (fast recording) and high diffraction efficiency due to the availability of electrons in the shallow traps. However, during readout, all the deep traps get filled quickly and the resulting holograms reside in the shallow traps where they are totally erased by further readout. Hence after extensive readout the diffraction efficiency drops to zero and the hologram stored cannot be fixed.|$|E

Although next generation sequencing provides robust, comparable and highly informative expression profiling data, with several million of tags per blood sample, reticulocyte globin transcripts can constitute up to 76 % of total mRNA compromising the detection of low abundant transcripts. We have removed globin transcripts from 6 human whole blood RNA samples with a human globin reduction kit and compared them with the same non-reduced samples using deep Serial Analysis of Gene Expression. Results Globin tags comprised 52 - 76 % of total tags in our samples. Out of 21, 633 genes only 87 genes were detected at significantly lower levels in the globin <b>reduced</b> <b>samples.</b> In contrast, 11, 338 genes were detected at significantly higher levels in the globin <b>reduced</b> <b>samples.</b> Removing globin transcripts allowed us to also identify 2112 genes {{that could not be}} detected in the non-globin <b>reduced</b> <b>samples,</b> with roles in cell surface receptor signal transduction, G-protein coupled receptor protein signalling pathways and neurological processes.

50|$|Bailey and Pearson’s (1983) 39‑Factor Computer User Satisfaction (CUS) {{questionnaire}} and its derivative, the User Information Satisfaction (UIS) short-form of Baroudi, Olson and Ives {{are typical of}} instruments which one might term as 'factor-based'. They consist of lists of factors, each of which the respondent is asked to rate on one or more multiple point scales. Bailey and Pearson’s CUS asked for five ratings for each of 39 factors. The first four scales were for quality ratings and the fifth was an importance rating. From the fifth rating of each factor, they found that their sample of users rated as most important: accuracy, reliability, timeliness, relevancy and confidence in the system. The factors of least importance {{were found to be}} feelings of control, volume of output, vendor support, degree of training, and organisational position of EDP (the electronic data processing, or computing department). However, the CUS requires 39 x 5 = 195 individual seven‑point scale responses. Ives, Olson and Baroudi (1983), amongst others, thought that so many responses could result in errors of attrition. This means, the respondent's failure to return the questionnaire or the increasing carelessness of the respondent as they fill in a long form. In psychometrics, such errors not only result in <b>reduced</b> <b>sample</b> sizes but can also distort the results, as those who return long questionnaires, properly completed, may have differing psychological traits from those who do not. Ives, et al. thus developed the UIS. This only requires the respondent to rate 13 factors, and so remains in significant use at the present time. Two seven‑point scales are provided per factor (each for a quality), requiring 26 individual responses in all. But in a recent article, Islam, Mervi and Käköla (2010) argued {{that it is difficult to}} measure user satisfaction in the industry settings as the response rate often remain low. Thus, a simpler version of user satisfaction measurement instrument is necessary.|$|E

Updated {{data of the}} 153 Galactic {{globular}} clusters are used to readdress fundamental parameters of the Milky Way, such as {{the distance of the}} Sun to the Galactic centre, the bulge and halo structural parameters, and cluster destruction rates. Methods. We build a <b>reduced</b> <b>sample</b> that has been decontaminated of all the clusters younger than 10 Gyr and of those with retrograde orbits and/or evidence of relation to dwarf galaxies. The <b>reduced</b> <b>sample</b> contains 116 {{globular clusters}} that are tested for whether they were formed in the primordial collapse. Results. The 33 metal-rich globular clusters ([Fe/H] ≥ − 0. 75) of the <b>reduced</b> <b>sample</b> basically extend to the Solar circle and are distributed over a region with the projected axial-ratios typical of an oblate spheroidal, Δx : Δy : Δz ≈ 1. 0 : 0. 9 : 0. 4.

The 81 metal-poor globular clusters span a nearly spherical region of axial-ratios ≈ 1. 0 : 1. 0 : 0. 8 extending from the central parts to the outer halo, although several clusters in the external region still require detailed studies to unravel their origin as accretion or collapse. A new estimate of the Sun’s distance to the Galactic centre, based on the symmetries of the spatial distribution of 116 globular clusters, is provided with a considerably smaller uncertainty than in previous determinations using globular clusters, RO = 7. 2 ± 0. 3 kpc. The metal-rich and metal-poor radial-density distributions flatten for RGC ≤ 2 kpc and are represented well over the full Galactocentric distance range both by a power-law with a core-like term and Sérsic’s law; at large distances they fall off as ∼R− 3. 9.

Although the influence of decentralisation on economic growth has received some attention form researchers in recent years, very few studies deal with its impact on regional inequalities. We analyse the relationship between different measures of regional inequalities in productivity, and various dimensions of political and fiscal decentralisation for a sample of nineteen OECD countries. It could be argued, however, that decentralisation is more relevant in large countries, where political power could be far removed (not only in distance, but also in other economically relevant senses) from peripheral regions. To check this hypothesis we will, in addition, work with a <b>reduced</b> <b>sample</b> of small countries, while controlling for other possible influences by widening the analysis to includes measures of public sector size {{and the type of}} governing party.
