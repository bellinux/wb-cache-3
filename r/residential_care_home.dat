40|$|During {{the last}} years the numbers of unaccompanied {{children}} seeking asylum in Sweden have increased rapidly. Most of these children are placed in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>homes.</b> Although influence is a right for the children, many studies show that their influence lacks at <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>homes.</b> Previous studies have also shown that social workers {{were aware of the}} importance of children’s influence but the problem was that they didn’t have any methods to make it work in practice. Further there are other studies that present methods in working with children’s influence. Client- focused work and actively listening to the children are two methods among others that studies has shown are important when working with influence. At the same time it has shown that the conditions at <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>homes</b> are not satisfying for working with children’s influence. We therefore wanted to study the accommodation- staffs’ experiences of children’s influence at <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>homes.</b> 8 accommodation- staffs’ were interviewed in various <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>homes</b> in a county in southern Sweden. We found that, based on the staffs reasoning, there is a lack of influence among the children at <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>homes.</b> The accommodation- staffs’ experiences however seemed to be based on the lack of sufficiently good methods and conditions at the <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>homes,</b> which also confirmed previous studies...|$|R

40|$|To the Editor—In {{response}} to the article “Prevention of medication error and unintentional drug poisoning in the elderly”, 1 I agree with and support the belief that health professionals visiting <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>homes</b> can prevent medication incidents. During the past two decades, many new drugs and technologies have been developed. In females, the life expectancy at birth has increased from 79 years in 1984 to 84. 6 years in 2004, whereas male life expectancy has increased from 73 years in 1984 to 78. 6 years in 2004. Most elderly people need to take many different medicines, therefore a proper medication management system {{is very important for}} <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>homes.</b> A medication management system not only focuses on storage, drug administration and record keeping but also on reconciliation. Health care professionals can play a vital part in medication management and safety in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>homes.</b> As pharmacists have adequate knowledge of drugs, they can make visits to <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>homes</b> to advise on drug management systems and ensure that the staff at <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>homes</b> are following the guidelines.

ICI moved out in 1961 and for some years the future of Vale Royal was in doubt. There were abortive schemes to use the abbey as a health centre, a country club, a school and even a prison (this latter proposal was resisted by local inhabitants as strongly, though less violently, as the original foundation of the abbey had been, and did not occur). In 1977, the abbey {{was made into a}} <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>home</b> for people with learning difficulties. Since 1998, Vale Royal has been home to a private golf club.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Studies {{done in the}} 1990 's {{suggested}} {{nursing home}} residents with cardiac arrest had minimal chance of survival and resuscitation was not recommended. More recent studies showed opposing results. In Hong Kong, the proportion of elderly living in the <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>homes</b> for the elderly is increasing. There is no study of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest outcomes in this population. This study aimed at evaluating the prognosis of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest occurring in the <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>homes</b> for the elderly. It is hoped that the findings may inform the local emergency medical service concerning the issue of futility of resuscitating the residents with cardiac arrest in the <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>homes.</b> METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of a database of all patients aged 65 years or above with atraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and who were attended by the emergency medical service in a 12 -month period. Data in the database were prospectively collected by the emergency medical service. The characteristics of patients and cardiac arrests, timeliness of the emergency medical service, and survival were analyzed. Comparison was made between elderly living in and not living in the <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>homes.</b> Predictors of survival were evaluated with logistic regression. RESULTS: 3919 patients aged >/= 65 years were analyzed. There were 1506 cases of cardiac arrest occurring in the <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>homes</b> for the elderly. Resuscitation was discontinued at the emergency department in over 70 % of these cases. The survival to hospital admission rate and the 30 -day survival rate were 9. 6 % and 0. 3 % respectively. Both were lower than patients not residing in the <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>homes.</b> Younger age, witnessed arrest, bystander defibrillation, and shorter call to ED interval were associated with higher chance of surviving to hospital admission. CONCLUSION: Elderly suffering from cardiac arrest in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>homes</b> had a poor chance of survival. Except age, witnessed arrest, bystander defibrillation, and call to ED interval are modifiable predictors of survival. It is inappropriate to declare that resuscitating elderly in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>homes</b> is futile unless those factors have been fully addressed...|$|R

40|$|Set {{within the}} context that the world’s {{population}} is ageing at an unprecedented rate, {{it is argued that}} care of the elderly, and their everyday lived experiences are poised to become prominent concerns. In the shadow of this, the ageing population poses a myriad of challenges not only for the elderly but also for policy makers who put in place systems for the provision of services within <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>homes.</b> By virtue, given that communities of elderly consumers voices are often muted within many academic analyses of social policy and service provision this study illuminates and distils communities of elderly consumers understandings of <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>homes.</b> Given the absence of suitable literature within the fields of marketing and interpretive consumer research, this study turns to the sociological and anthropological literature of Hall and Jefferson (1976) and Levi-Strauss (1966). In doing so, communities of elderly consumers within <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>homes</b> can be theorised as a cultural community of ‘bricoleurs’ within a ‘cultural map of meaning’. Furthermore, viewed through this lens, such bricoleurs can be seen to understand their meaningful everyday lived experiences within, and through, the use of ‘bricolage’. Emanating from eight existential-phenomenological interviews, a rich picture emerges wherein bricoleurs understandings of <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>homes</b> can be seen to be embedded not only within, but also through, such things as the body, leisure trips, noise disturbances, death, large items of furniture, small hand-sized objects, mobility aids, quality of care and social interaction. Moreover, {{in the light of the}} resultant interpretations common themes can be seen to emerge within communities of bricoleurs social and material understandings of <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>homes,</b> namely the notion of cultures of dependency, trauma and comfort. This research contributes to marketing knowledge in that it argues that communities of ‘elderly bricoleurs’ within <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>homes</b> can be seen to be held together by unique understandings of cultures of dependency, trauma and comfort. Furthermore, it is also argued that elderly bricoleurs address themselves to a relatively limited amount of bricolage that enables them to keep alive actual, desired, imagined and fictional community ties. Furthermore, the reality and efficacy of cultural communities of elderly bricoleurs seems to depend on their ability to address ‘whatever is to hand’ (Levi-Strauss, 1966) in order to construct and understand their cultural maps of meaning within <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>homes...</b>|$|R
