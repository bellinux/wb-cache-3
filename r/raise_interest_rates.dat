25|$|During the 1980 recession, {{manufacturing}} shed 1.1million jobs, while {{service industries}} remained intact. Employment in automotive manufacturing in particular suffered, experiencing a 33% reduction {{by the end}} of the recession. Collectively these factors contributed to the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. The Federal Reserve once again began to <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> in 1981, which plunged the economy back into recession. Unemployment rose to a peak of 10.8% in December 1982, a post-war high.|$|E
25|$|During the Great Depression, {{every major}} {{currency}} abandoned {{the gold standard}}. Among the earliest, the Bank of England abandoned the gold standard in 1931 as speculators demanded gold in exchange for currency, threatening the solvency of the British monetary system. This pattern repeated throughout Europe and North America. In the United States, the Federal Reserve was forced to <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> {{in order to protect}} the gold standard for the US dollar, worsening already severe domestic economic pressures. After bank runs became more pronounced in early 1933, people began to hoard gold coins as distrust for banks led to distrust for paper money, worsening deflation and depleting gold reserves.|$|E
25|$|The {{worldwide}} {{recession of}} the early 1990s significantly damaged the government's financial situation. Mulroney's inability to improve the government's finances, {{as well as his}} use of tax increases to deal with it, were major factors in alienating the western conservative portion of his power base – this contrasted with his tax cuts earlier as part of his 'pro-business' plan which had increased the deficit. At the same time, the Bank of Canada began to <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> in order to meet a zero inflation target; the experiment was regarded as a failure that exacerbated the effect of the recession in Canada. Annual budget deficits ballooned to record levels, reaching $42 billion in his last year of office. These deficits grew the national debt dangerously close to the psychological benchmark of 100% of GDP, further weakening the Canadian dollar and damaging Canada's international credit rating.|$|E

25|$|It is {{generally}} accepted {{that the price}} of gold is closely related to interest rates. As interest rates rise, the general tendency is for the gold price, which earns no interest, to fall, and vice versa. As a result, the gold price can be closely correlated to central banks via their monetary policy decisions on interest rates. For example, if market signals indicate the possibility of prolonged inflation, central banks may decide to <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> which could reduce the price of gold. But this does not always happen: after the European Central Bank raised its interest rate slightly on April 7, 2011, {{for the first time since}} 2008, the price of gold drove higher, and hit a new high one day later. Similarly, in August 2011 when interest rates in India were at their highest in two years, the gold prices peaked as well.|$|E
2500|$|In this era, the {{experience}} of Great Britain and others was that the gold standard ran counter {{to the need to}} retain domestic policy autonomy. To protect their reserves of gold, countries would sometimes need to <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and generally follow a deflationary policy. The greatest need for this could arise in a downturn, just when leaders would have preferred to lower rates to encourage growth. Economist Nicholas Davenport ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, Greenspan raised {{interest}} rates several times; these actions were believed {{by many to}} have caused the bursting of the dot-com bubble. According to Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, however, [...] "he didn't <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> to curb the market's enthusiasm; he didn't even seek to impose margin requirements on stock market investors. Instead, he waited until the bubble burst, {{as it did in}} 2000, then tried {{to clean up the mess}} afterward". E. Ray Canterbery agrees with Krugman's criticism.|$|E
5000|$|Between 2004 and 2006, the Fed <b>raised</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> 17 times, {{increasing}} {{them from}} 1% to 5.25%, before pausing. The Fed paused <b>raising</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> {{because of the}} concern that an accelerating downturn {{in the housing market}} could undermine the overall economy, just as the crash of the dot-com bubble in 2000 contributed to the subsequent recession. However, New York University economist Nouriel Roubini asserted that [...] "The Fed should have tightened earlier to avoid a festering of the housing bubble early on." ...|$|R
5000|$|Banks: Banks can tend {{to change}} the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> to either slow down or speed up economy growth. This {{involves}} either <b>raising</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> to slow the economy down, or lowering <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> to promote economic growth.|$|R

2500|$|Currency {{speculation}} {{is considered a}} highly suspect activity in many countries. [...] While investment in traditional financial instruments like bonds or stocks often is considered to contribute positively to economic growth by providing capital, currency speculation does not; according to this view, it is simply gambling that often interferes with economic policy. For example, in 1992, currency speculation forced the Swedish National Bank (the central bank of Sweden) to <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> {{for a few days}} to 500% per annum, and later to devalue the krona. Mahathir Mohamad, one of the former Prime Ministers of Malaysia, is one well-known proponent of this view. He blamed the devaluation of the Malaysian ringgit in 1997 on George Soros and other speculators.|$|E
2500|$|On May 3, 2007, Ellison {{introduced}} a bill to outlaw universal default, the practice whereby credit card companies <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> on customers who are behind on payments to other creditors. The bill was supported by House Financial Services Committee chairman Barney Frank. Ellison, who described the bill as [...] "the beginning of a whole credit reform effort we're going to be pursuing," [...] also announced his interest in limiting high interest rates on credit cards and easing the process {{for those who have}} a legitimate need to file bankruptcy. This provision ultimately became law in 2009 as part of the [...] "Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights" [...] portion of the Credit CARD Act of 2009.|$|E
2500|$|MMT does point out, however, {{that debt}} {{denominated}} {{in a foreign}} currency certainly is a fiscal risk to governments, since the indebted government cannot create foreign currency. In this case {{the only way the}} government can sustainably repay its foreign debt is to ensure that its currency is continually and highly demanded by foreigners over the period that it wishes to repay the debt – an exchange rate collapse would potentially multiply the debt many times over asymptotically, making it impossible to repay. In that case, the government can default, or attempt to shift to an export-led strategy or <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> to attract foreign investment in the currency. Either one has a negative effect on the economy. Euro debt crises in the [...] "PIIGS" [...] countries that began in 2009 reflect this risk, since Greece, Ireland, Spain, Italy, etc. have all issued debts in a quasi-"foreign currency" [...] – the Euro, which they cannot create.|$|E

2500|$|Contrary to Truman's expectations, however, Martin {{guarded the}} Fed's independence, not just through Truman's {{administration}} but also through the four administrations that would follow. To the present day, his term as Chairman {{is the longest}} term the Board of Governors has seen. Over nearly two decades, Martin would achieve global recognition as a central banker. He was able to pursue independent monetary policies while still paying heed to the desires of various administrations. Although the objectives of Martin's monetary policy were low inflation and economic stability, he rejected {{the idea that the}} Fed could pursue its policies through the targeting of a single indicator and instead made policy decisions by examining a wide array of economic information. As Chairman, he institutionalized this approach within the proceedings of the FOMC, gathering the opinions of all governors and presidents within the System before making decisions. As a result, his decisions were often supported by unanimous votes on the FOMC. The job of the Federal Reserve, he famously said, is [...] "to take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going," [...] that is, <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> just when economy reaches peak activity after a recession.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1833, Jackson, despite {{opposition}} from {{some members of}} his cabinet, decided to withdraw the Government's funds from the Bank. The incumbent Secretary of the Treasury, Louis McLane, a member of Jackson's [...] Cabinet, professed moderate support for the Bank. He therefore refused to withdraw the Federal funds directed by the President and would not resign, so Jackson then transferred him to the State Department. McLane's successor, William J. Duane, was also opposed to the Bank, but would not carry out Jackson's orders either. After waiting four months, President Jackson summarily dismissed Duane, replacing him with Attorney General Roger B. Taney as a recess appointment when Congress was out of session. In September 1833, Taney helped transfer the public deposits from the Bank to seven state-chartered banks. Faced {{with the loss of}} the Federal deposits, Biddle decided to <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and deliberately induce a recession. A mild financial panic ensued from late 1833 to mid-1834. Intended to force Jackson into a compromise, the move backfired, increasing anti-Bank sentiment. Meanwhile, Biddle and other Bank supporters attempted to renew the Bank's charter though the Congress on numerous occasions. All their attempts failed under the threat of a Jackson presidential veto.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{entering}} office, Obama {{focused on}} handling {{the global financial}} crisis and the subsequent Great Recession, which was generally regarded as the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. On February 17, 2009, Obama signed into law a $787 billion economic stimulus bill that included spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and incentives, and direct assistance to individuals. The tax provisions of the law temporarily reduced taxes for 98 percent of taxpayers, bringing tax rates to their lowest levels in 60 years. The Obama administration would later argue that the stimulus saved the United States from a [...] "double-dip" [...] recession. Obama asked for a second major stimulus package in December 2009, but no major second stimulus bill passed. Obama also launched a second bailout of US automakers, possibly saving General Motors and Chrysler from bankruptcy {{at the cost of}} $9.3 billion. For homeowners in danger of defaulting on their mortgage due to the subprime mortgage crisis, Obama launched several programs, including HARP and HAMP. Obama re-appointed Ben Bernanke as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in 2009, and appointed Janet Yellen to succeed Bernanke in 2013. Short-term interest rates remained near zero for much of Obama's presidency, and the Federal Reserve did not <b>raise</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> during Obama's presidency until December 2015.|$|E
40|$|Some new {{empirical}} {{evidence on the}} determination of long-term <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> in the United States is presented.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{model of}} {{balance of payments}} crises implicitly assumes that the central bank sits passively as international reserves dwindle. In practice, however, central banks typically defend pegs aggressively by <b>raising</b> short-term <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> This paper analyzes the feasibility and optimality of <b>raising</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> to delay a potential BOP crisis. <b>Interest</b> <b>rate</b> policy works through two distinct channels. By raising demand for domestic, interest-bearing liquid assets, higher <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> tend to delay the crisis. Higher <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> however, increase public debt service and imply higher future inflation, which tends to bring forward the crisis. We show that, under certain conditions, it is feasible to delay the crisis, but <b>raising</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> beyond a certain point may actually hasten the crisis. A similar nonmonotonic relationship emerges between welfare {{and the increase in}} <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> It is thus optimal to engage in some active <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> defense but only up to a certain point. In fact, there is a whole range of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> increases for which it is feasible to delay the crisis but not optimal to do so. ...|$|R

Using a dataset that covers 54 countries from March 1964 through December 2005, we find strong evidence that <b>raising</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> in advance has significantly different impacts in different country groups. It significantly reduces the probability of attacks in countries that have a de facto hard peg but increases it in de facto soft-pegging countries. This finding is robust to alternative measure of monetary policy and to different specifications and samples.
