40|$|The {{examination}} of critical factors determining {{the performance of}} bioscouring showed that a short treatment of the fabric at greater than 80 °C after pectinase treatment at 60 °C was essential for removal of waxes from the fabric as demonstrated by diminished intensities of methylene peaks in FT-IR measurements. Batch-wise bioscouring of cotton knits was carried out several times with post-treatment at 80 °C using a <b>rapid</b> <b>dyeing</b> machine. The dye-ability of bioscoured knits {{was as good as}} the company's alkaline scoured ones with slightly higher K/S values. Water pollution caused by effluents of bioscouring and alkaline processes were estimated, as well as that due to the input of chemicals and enzymes. Higher BOD:CODCr ratios for enzymes indicated their biodegradable character. After calculation of energy consumption using a simulation program, an economic evaluation of the two processes was done on the basis of one ton production by considering the costs of chemicals and enzyme, water usage, energy consumption and waste water treatment charge...|$|E

The rate of fade is much slower with dye-based inks on swellable media and, in general, with pigment-based inks. As {{part of an ongoing}} effort to establish a standardized test method to accelerate the rate of ozone-induced fade, we have been exploring the use of high concentrations of ozone under controlled conditions. A key assumption, necessary to estimate the corresponding rate of fade at much lower, ambient levels of ozone, {{is that there is a}} reciprocal relationship between ozone concentration and time of exposure.

40|$|A highly {{efficient}} {{mechanism for the}} regeneration of the cisbis(isothiocyanato) bis(2, 2 ′-bipyridyl- 4, 4 ′-dicarboxylato) -ruthenium (II) sensitizing dye (N 3) by I- in acetonitrile has been identified by using molecular dynamics simulation based on density functional theory. Barrier-free complex formation of the oxidized dye with both I- and I - 2, and facile dissociation of I- 2 and I- 3 from the reduced dye are key steps in this process. In situ vibrational spectroscopy confirms the reversible binding of I 2 to the thiocyanate group. Additionally, simulations of the electrolyte near the interface suggest that acetonitrile is able to cover the (101) surface of anatase with a passivating layer that inhibits direct contact of the redox mediator with the oxide, and that the solvent structure specifically enhances the concentration of I- at a distance which further favors <b>rapid</b> <b>dye</b> regeneration...|$|R
40|$|During the light-harvesting {{process of}} {{dye-sensitized solar cells}} (DSSCs), the hole {{localized}} on the dye after the charge separation yields an oxidized dye, D^+. The fast regeneration of D^+ using the redox pair (typically the I^–/I_(3) ^– couple) is critical for the efficient DSSCs. However, the kinetic processes of dye regeneration remain uncertain, still promoting vigorous debates. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to determine that the inner-sphere electron-transfer pathway provides a <b>rapid</b> <b>dye</b> regeneration route of ∼ 4 ps, where penetration of I^− next to D^+ enables an immediate electron transfer, forming a kinetic barrier. This explains the recently reported ultrafast dye regeneration rate of a few picoseconds determined experimentally. We expect that our MD based comprehensive understanding of the dye regeneration mechanism will provide a helpful guideline in designing TiO_ 2 −dye−electrolyte interfacial systems for better performing DSSCs...|$|R

Coffee, tea, lettuce and citrus waste have been utilized without any pre-treatment, thus the adsorption capacities and dye removal efficiency were determined. Coffee waste showed highest adsorbent capacity, followed by tea, lettuce and citrus waste. The dye removal was more effective as dye concentration increases from 5 up to 60 mg/L. The favorable results obtained for lettuce waste have been especially encouraged, as this material has not been commonly employed for sorption purposes. Equilibrium data fitted very well in a Freundlich isotherm model, whereas pseudo-second-order kinetic model describes the process behavior.

40|$|The {{susceptibility}} {{of human}} {{herpes simplex virus}} (HSV) to acyclovir (ACV) was determined {{with the use of}} a single dose of the drug (1 and 2 μg of ACV per ml for HSV- 1 and HSV- 2, respectively) in two rapid assays: a rapid cytopathic effect inhibitory assay (Rapid CIA) and a <b>rapid</b> <b>dye</b> uptake assay (<b>Rapid</b> DUA). These tests allow the simultaneous determination of virus titer and susceptibility to ACV at a determined viral concentration (100 50 % tissue culture infective doses and 100 50 % dye uptake units). These tests were compared with a conventional susceptibility assay (dye uptake assay) and showed similar results. Indeterminate results with the Rapid CIA appeared in 3 of 30 samples. With the use of both Rapid CIA and Rapid DUA, we were able to determine the susceptibility of 100 % of the isolates. The rapid tests, unlike conventional assays, are able to provide susceptibility results within 3 days after the virus has been isolated from a clinical specimen and could thus play a direct role in therapeutic decisions...|$|R
40|$|Marasmius cladophyllus was {{examined}} {{for its ability}} to degradatively decolourise the recalcitrant dye Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) and screened for the production of ligninolytic enzymes using specific substrates. Monitoring dye decolourisation by the decrease in absorbance ratio of A 592 /A 500 shows that the decolourisation of RBBR dye was associated with the dye degradation. Marasmius cladophyllus produces laccase and lignin peroxidase in glucose minimal liquid medium containing RBBR. Both enzyme activities were increased, with laccase activity recorded 70 times higher reaching up to 390 [*]U[*]L− 1 on day 12. Further in vitro RBBR dye decolourisation using the culture medium shows that laccase activity was correlated with the dye decolourisation. Fresh RBBR dye continuously supplemented into the decolourised culture medium was further decolourised much faster in the subsequent round of the RBBR dye decolourisation. In vitro dye decolourisation using the crude laccase not only decolourised 76 % of RBBR dye in just 19 hours but also decolourised 54 % of Orange G and 33 % of Congo red at the same period of time without the use of any exogenous mediator. This <b>rapid</b> <b>dye</b> decolourisation ability of the enzymes produced by M. cladophyllus thus suggested its possible application in the bioremediation of dye containing wastewater...|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} potential cooperative interactions of Listeria monocytogenes phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) and listeriolysin O (LLO), a pore-forming hemolysin, in a liposome lysis assay. Large unilamellar vesicles, approximately 0. 1 micron in diameter, encapsulating the fluorescent probe calcein, {{were treated with}} PI-PLC or LLO at pH 6. 0, and each was capable of causing dye release. With phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylinositol/cholesterol liposomes at 0. 1 microM lipid, minimal release of dye was observed on addition of 80 pM LLO or 7 nM PI-PLC. Addition of the two proteins together produced <b>rapid</b> <b>dye</b> release. Unexpectedly, essentially identical results were obtained with phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol liposomes. Thus, the effect of PI-PLC did not depend on lipid hydrolysis. Both proteins also released inulin (M(r) 5200) from liposomes. Membrane permeabilization was not accompanied by membrane fusion. Very little dye release from phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylinositol/cholesterol liposomes was seen with PI-PLC from Bacillus thuringiensis, and addition of this enzyme to LLO produced no additional dye release; however PI-PLC from L. monocytogenes cooperated with perfringolysin O from Clostridium perfringens. PI-PLC from L. monocytogenes and LLO bind to phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol liposomes, {{and the rate of}} binding of each protein was not influenced by the presence of the other.

40|$|Secretion {{of hormones}} and other {{bioactive}} substances {{is a fundamental}} process for virtually all multicellular organisms. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), we have studied the calcium-triggered exocytosis of single, fluorescently labeled large, dense core vesicles in the human neuroendocrine BON cell line. Three types of exocytotic events were observed: (1) simple fusions (disappearance of a fluorescent spot by rapid diffusion of the dye released to the extracellular space), (2) "orphan" fusions for which only <b>rapid</b> <b>dye</b> diffusion, but not the parent vesicle, could be detected, and (3) events with incomplete or multi-step disappearance of a fluorescent spot. Although all three types were reported previously, only the first case is clearly understood. Here, thanks {{to a combination of}} two-color imaging, variable angle TIRFM, and novel statistical analyses, we show that the latter two types of events are generated by the same basic mechanism, namely shape retention of fused vesicle ghosts which become targets for sequential fusions with deeper lying vesicles. Overall, approximately 25 % of all exocytotic events occur via sequential fusion. Secondary vesicles, located 200 - 300 nm away from the cell membrane are as fusion ready as primary vesicles located very near the cell membrane. These findings call for a fundamental shift in current models of regulated secretion in endocrine cells. Previously, sequential fusion had been studied mainly using two-photon imaging. To the best of our knowledge, this work constitutes the first quantitative report on sequential fusion using TIRFM, despite its long running and widespread use in studies of secretory mechanisms...|$|R
30|$|Surface {{properties}} and adsorption mechanism of anionic Reactive Red 120 (RR 120) dye onto raw clay was investigated by Errais’ group. The kinetics of the RR 120 adsorption {{on the four}} clays [Fouchana clay, smectite (SWy- 1), kaolinite (KGa- 2) and illite (IMt- 2)] determined in the same operating conditions showed <b>rapid</b> <b>dye</b> removal {{in the initial stages}} of contact time and reached equilibrium after 20  min for Fouchana and KGa- 2, and after 60  min for SWy- 1 and IMt- 2 during a 180  min reaction time. The rapid adsorption during the first 20  min for KGa- 2 and Fouchana clay was due to the abundant availability of active sites on the clay surface; but with the gradual occupancy of these sites, the adsorption became less efficient. By contrast, adsorption of the RR 120 dye on SWy- 1 and IMt- 2 was less rapid and completed in about 1  h, indicating that for the same initial mass of clay and dye concentration, the adsorption rate was higher for KGa- 2 and Fouchana clay (~ 98  %) than for SWy- 1 (~ 4  %) and IMt- 2 (~ 3  %) (Errais 2011). At the chosen experimental conditions, KGa- 2, with the lowest CEC, possessed the highest adsorption rate and yield. The adsorption capacity of SWy- 1 was low compared with that of KGa- 2 or Fouchana clay (which contains 30  % kaolinite), although it has high exchange capacity. Thus, the exchange phenomena between the layers were not the main processes of adsorption that was to be expected considering the negative surface charge of the clay and the anionic nature of the dye molecules; they may, however, be responsible for retention of dye molecules in the case of SWy- 1 (Errais et al. 2012).|$|R
40|$|The present work {{examines}} {{and models}} physico-chemical aspects of dyeing processes of cotton fibre with a direct dye (C. l. Direct Yellow 162). The models and methods {{in this thesis}} were developed {{with the aim of}} providing analytical tools that could help to cut back dyeing process times compared to current standard industrial practice, to reduce the need for dye additions and re-works, and to diminish or eliminate the use of some types of auxiliary, such as levelling agents. Theoretical considerations revealed that three parameters appear to be central to the scaling of jet dyeing equipment: the liquor ratio, the number of fabric as well as of dyeliquor revolutions per minute and the dimensionless parameter L, which describes the influence of the tlow regime in the dyeing machine on the exhaustion kinetics. Experiments on the pilotscale jet dyeing machine showed that, under scaled-down industrial process conditions, the dye uptake rate was not affected by boundary layer effects. Several thermodynamic models were examined for their accuracy to predict the dye amount sorbed by the fibre under equilibrium conditions. Two versions of the Gouy-Chapman model and three models derived from the Donnan membrane equilibrium were evaluated. Best overall results were obtained with a GOlly-Chapman model using a variable fibre saturation molality for the dye. The average back-prediction error of this model for the dye on fibre amount was below two per cent. A newly developed model of the exhaustion kinetics of the dyeing process interprets the dye uptake rate as a combination of <b>rapid</b> <b>dye</b> adsorption at the fibre surface with slow diffusional dye transfer from the surface into the fibre interior. The model predicted the exhaustion values of isothermal experiments with an average accuracy of + 1 - 2. 3...|$|R

40|$|Eggs attract sperm by {{chemical}} factors, {{a process}} called chemotaxis. Sperm from marine invertebrates use cGMP signalling to transduce incident chemoattractants into changes in the Ca 2 + concentration in the flagellum, which control the swimming behaviour during chemotaxis. The signalling pathway downstream of the synthesis of cGMP by a guanylyl cyclase is ill-defined. In particular, the ion channels {{that are involved in}} Ca 2 + influx and their mechanisms of gating are not known. Using <b>rapid</b> voltage-sensitive <b>dyes</b> and kinetic techniques, we record the voltage response that is evoked by the chemoattractant in sperm from the sea urchin Arbacia punctulata. We show that the chemoattractant evokes a brief hyperpolarization followed by a sustained depolarization. The hyperpolarization is caused by the opening of K+-selective cyclic-nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels in the flagellum. Ca 2 + influx commences at the onset of recovery from hyperpolarization. The voltage threshold of Ca 2 + entry indicates the involvement of low-voltage-activated Ca(v) channels. These results establish a model of chemosensory transduction in sperm whereby a cGMP-induced hyperpolarization opens Ca(v) channels by a 'recovery-from-inactivation' mechanism and unveil an evolutionary kinship between transduction mechanisms in sperm and photoreceptors...|$|R

Compound 1 forms vesicles both in the absence and in the presence of guest species, and its fluorescence intensity does not change. Compound 2 forms fibers, which change into vesicles upon guest addition. This behavior is accompanied by a reduction in fluorescence intensity. The aggregates were visualized by transmission electron microscopy using both the freeze fracture technique and the uranyl staining method.

We investigated whether their transduction sites are located on major blood vessels close to and within the gut wall. METHODS: In vitro extracellular recordings were made from mesenteric nerve trunks in guinea pig ileum, combined with <b>rapid</b> axonal <b>dye</b> filling and immunohistochemical analysis of nerve trunks. RESULTS: Recordings revealed sensory fibers with focal mechanosensitive sites in the mesenteries that could be activated by von Frey hairs and by stretch. Dye filling revealed varicose branching sensory axons on mesenteric blood vessels but no other anatomically specialized structures in mesenteric membranes or the serosa. Large-amplitude stretch and von Frey hairs also activated sensory endings within the gut wall itself {{but only if the}} submucosa was present; mechanotransduction sites in the serosa or outer muscle layers were sparse. Mechanosensitive sites in submucosa were exclusively associated with submucosal blood vessels. Submucosal endings had significantly higher thresholds to stretch than specialized low-threshold mechanoreceptors characterized previously in the rectum (P<. 05) and were therefore classified as medium/high-threshold mechanoreceptors. Capsaicin (0. 3 – 1 _mol/L) activated most mechanosensitive mesenteric (68 %) and submucosal (85 %) afferent endings. Similar intramural mechanosensitive afferent endings on blood vessels also exist in the colon and bladder. CONCLUSIONS: Varicose branching axons of sensory neurons on intramural blood vessels, previously shown to mediate sensory vasodilation, are transduction sites for medium/ high-threshold, stretch-sensitive mechanoreceptors, encoding large distentions in hollow viscera.

The decrease in MO dye concentration was examined by UVâVisible spectroscopy at different time intervals under ultraviolet light irradiation, until the dye was completely degraded to colorless end product. <b>Rapid</b> MO <b>dye</b> decomposition was observed with a degradation rate of â¼ 93, 70 and 44 % on the CZC- 1, CZC- 0. 25 and ZnO/CNT within the initial 110 Â min, respectively. The fast degradation rate and high degradation efficiency of CZC- 1 and CZC- 0. 25 is attributed to the porous nature, large specific surface area (162. 5 and 136. 1 Â m 2 Â gâ 1), narrow pore size distribution (7. 46 and 12. 98 Â nm) evaluated from N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms analysis and excellent electron accepting features of the engineered porous Cd@ZnO/CNT-NCs. The kinetic results revealed that the degradation rate of MO on the CZC- 1 (i. e. Cd 0. 5 Zn 0. 5 O/CNT) and CZC- 0. 25 (i. e. Cd 0. 25 Zn 0. 75 O/CNT) is approximately 2 - and 4 -folds larger than the CNT/ZnO that {{can be explained by the}} replacement of Cd ions in the ZnO structure. The degradation of the model dyes was observed to follow pseudo first order degradation kinetics.

40|$|Objective: Rapid {{discrimination}} {{of three}} classes of safflowers, dyed safflower, adulterated safflower, and pure safflower using computer vision and image processing algorithms. Methods: A low cost {{computer vision system}} (CVS) was designed to measure the color of safflowers in the RGB (red, green, blue), L∗a∗b∗, and HSV (hue, saturation, vale) color spaces. The color moments in these three color spaces were extracted from the acquired images as color features of safflower. In addition, five kinds of pigments that are commonly used to dye safflowers were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography as a reference. Pattern recognition methods were investigated for rapid discrimination, including an unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm and a supervised partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) algorithm. Results: The mean error (e¯) between color values measured with the colorimeter and calculated with the CVS was 2. 4 %, with a high correlation coefficient (r) of 0. 9905. This result indicated that the established CVS was reliable for color estimation of safflowers. The PLS-DA model, which had a total accuracy of 91. 89 %, outperformed the PCA model in classifying pure, adulterated, and dyed safflowers. Conclusion: The color objectification is a promising tool for <b>rapid</b> identification of <b>dyed</b> and adulterated safflowers...|$|R
40|$|In the {{previous}} papers {{of this series}} it was shown that trypan blue injected directly into an inflamed area was fixed in situ and failed to reach the tributary lymph nodes (1). When this dye was introduced into the circulating blood stream it rapidly entered the inflamed area and was fixed there. Subsequent studies showed that the <b>rapid</b> accumulation of <b>dye</b> in an inflamed area {{is the result of}} increased capillary permeability (2). These studies were then extended and it was found that colloidal iron or ferric chloride injected directly into an inflamed area was fixed in situ by the inflammatory process, and that ferric chloride injected intravenously rapidly entered inflamed cutaneous areas, where its presence was identified by both qualitative and quantitative determinations (3). The earlier literature on the dissemination of substances from the site of injection has been reviewed in previous publications (1 and 2). Opie (4) showed that foreign protein injected into the skin of an actively immunized animal is fixed at the site of injection where the contact of antigen and antibody causes an acute inflammatory reaction (Arthus phenomenon). In view of this work on immunized animals and of the results obtained with trypan blue and iron, experiments were undertaken to determine whether a readily identified foreign protein such as horse serum injected into an area of inflammation caused by either bacteria or a sterile irritant would also be retained in situ by the inflammatory reaction...|$|R
40|$|State University is toenhance the {{international}} competitiveness of the U. S. fiber, textile and apparel industries through research. Theresearch program integrates the design, manufacturing and marketing {{functions of the}} textile product pipeline. Over the past two years, faculty and students from the departments of textile engineering, chemistry, and science, textile and apparel management, mechanical and aerospace engineering and industrial engineering have focused on three interdisciplinary projects to achieve the goal. One of the three projects focused on wet processing optimization and control. Improvement of the batch dyeing process through real-time data acquisition and control is the major goal of the project. Data acquisition in batch dyeing typically involves gathering information {{on the status of}} time, temperature, pressure and speed variables. Current state-of-the-art commercial dyeing produces shade variations which may require that each dye lot be handled separately. To control shade variation so that downstream mixing of lots is possible, additional variables-pH, conductivity and dye absorbance-must be sensed and controlled. A system that senses variables in real-time has been developed. The system includes a minicomputer to manage and graphically display the real-time data, a sampling system and four sensors. Absorbances of the dyes in the bath are measured by a microcomputercontrolled fiber optics spectrophotometer. The system has proven useful in both the study of the dyeing process and in the <b>rapid</b> determination of <b>dye</b> compatibility. Use of real-time data to control the dyeing process is anticipated...|$|R
40|$|The {{unsymmetrical}} cyanine dye thiazole orange homodimer (TOTO) binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA, M 13 mp 18 ssDNA) to form {{a fluorescent}} complex that is stable under the standard conditions of electrophoresis. The stability of this complex is indistinguishable {{from that of the}} corresponding complex of TOTO with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). To examine if TOTO exhibits any binding preference for dsDNA or ssDNA, transfer of TOTO from pre-labeled complexes to excess unlabeled DNA was assayed by gel electrophoresis. Transfer of TOTO from M 13 ssDNA to unlabeled dsDNA proceeds to the same extent as that from M 13 dsDNA to unlabeled dsDNA. A substantial amount of the dye is retained by both the M 13 ssDNA and M 13 dsDNA even when the competing dsDNA is present at a 600 -fold weight excess; for both dsDNA and ssDNA, the pre-labeled complex retains approximately one TOTO per 30 bp (dsDNA) or bases (ssDNA). <b>Rapid</b> transfer of <b>dye</b> from both dsDNA and ssDNA complexes is seen at Na+ concentrations > 50 mM. Interestingly, at higher Na+ or Mg 2 + concentrations, the M 13 ssDNA-TOTO complex appears to be more stable to intrinsic dissociation (dissociation in the absence of competing DNA) than the complex between TOTO and M 13 dsDNA. Similar results were obtained with the structurally unrelated dye ethidium homodimer. The dsDNA- and ssDNA-TOTO complexes were further examined by absorption, fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The surprising conclusion is that polycationic dyes, such as TOTO and EthD, capable of bis-intercalation, interact with dsDNA and ssDNA with very similar high affinity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe cathelicidin-derived {{antimicrobial}} tritrpticin {{could be}} classified as either Trp-rich or Pro/Arg-rich peptide. We recently found that the sequence modification of tritrpticin focused on Trp and Pro residues led to considerable change in structure and antimicrobial potency and selectivity, but their mechanisms of microbial killing action were still unclear. Here, to better understand the bactericidal mechanisms of tritrpticin and its two analogs, TPA and TWF, we studied their effect on the viability of Gram-positive S. aureus and Gram-negative E. coli in relation to their membrane depolarization. Although TWF more effectively inhibited growth of S. aureus and E. coli than TPA, only a 30  min exposure to TPA was sufficient to kill both bacteria and TWF required a lag period of about 3 – 6  h for bactericidal activity. Their different bactericidal kinetics was associated with membrane permeabilization, i. e., TWF showed negligible ability to depolarize the cytoplasmic membrane potential of target cell membrane, whereas we observed significant membrane depolarization for TPA. In addition, while TPA caused <b>rapid</b> and large <b>dye</b> leakage from negatively charged model vesicles, TWF showed very little membrane-disrupting activity. Interestingly, we have looked for a synergism among the three peptides against E. coli, supporting that they are working with different modes of action. Collectively, our results suggest that TPA disrupts the ion gradients across the membrane, causing depolarization and a loss of microbial viability. By contrast, TWF more likely translocates across the cytoplasmic membrane without depolarization and then acts against one or more intracellular targets. Tritrpticin exhibits intermediate properties and appears to act via membrane depolarization coupled to secondary intracellular targeting...|$|R
40|$|Neutrophils {{respond to}} a variety of stimuli by {{generating}} superoxide anion, degranulating, and aggregating. Because {{it has been suggested that}} fusion of granules with the plasmalemma (degranulation) is necessary for aggregation and superoxide anion generation, we have tested whether these responses can be demonstrated in "neutrophilic cytoplasts" (granule-free vesicles of cytoplasm enclosed by plasmalemma). When examined by electron microscopy, cytoplasts were found to be approximately 4 microns in diameter and essentially granule free. Cytoplasts exposed to fMet-Leu-Phe (0. 1 microM) generated superoxide anion after a lag of 16 sec but released no detectable beta-glucuronidase, lysozyme, or elastase. Aggregation of cytoplasts, as measured by changes in light transmission, was also activated by fMet-Leu-Phe; no lag period was observed. Electron microscopy of the aggregates demonstrated clusters of cytoplasts with a scalloped appearance. Superoxide anion generation and aggregation of cytoplasts were also activated by phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate, concanavalin A, and leukotriene B 4. Exposure of cytoplasts to the dye 3, 3 '-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC 6 (3) ] led to dye uptake and enhancement of fluorescence, implying that the vesicles were sealed and maintained a membrane potential across the plasmalemma. Exposure of DiOC 6 (3) -loaded cytoplasts to fMet-Leu-Phe and PMA caused a <b>rapid</b> loss of <b>dye</b> fluorescence that was not inhibited by CN-, compatible with their lack of mitochondria. Exposure of dye-loaded cytoplasts to concanavalin A or leukotriene B 4 caused an increase in fluorescence [...] i. e., a hyperpolarization. These results demonstrate that degranulation is not a prerequisite for aggregation or superoxide anion generation. The retention of ionic gradients and changes in membrane potential, as measured by DiOC 6 (3) fluorescence changes, suggest a fundamental role for ionic movements in activating superoxide anion generation and aggregation...|$|R
