5|$|The Great Circle was {{surrounded}} by a ditch and is accompanied by smaller stone circles to the north east and south west. There is also a group of three stones, known as The Cove, in the garden of the local pub. Slightly further from the Great Circle is a single stone, known as Hautville's Quoit. Some of the stones are still vertical, but the majority are now <b>recumbent</b> and some are no longer present.|$|E
5|$|The Rokeby Venus {{may have}} been {{intended}} as a pendant to a sixteenth-century Venetian painting of a <b>recumbent</b> Venus (which seems to have begun life as a Danaë) in a landscape, in the same pose, but seen from the front. The two were certainly hung together {{for many years in}} Spain when in the collection of Gaspar Méndez de Haro, 7th Marquis of Carpio (1629–87); at what point they were initially paired is uncertain.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{striking}} differences between <b>recumbents</b> and upright bikes. Since <b>recumbents</b> vary widely, {{the advantages and}} disadvantages listed below may apply to different types to different degrees or not at all.

5|$|There are 76memorials in the church. These {{include the}} 14th-century tomb of Ralph Davenport with the <b>recumbent</b> {{figure of a}} knight wearing plate armour with a gorget (collar) of mail (armour {{consisting}} of linked metal rings) and a conical helmet, a tomb chest of 1654, and a <b>recumbent</b> effigy (statue) of LadyEgerton, who died in 1599. The church also contains two sanctuary chairs and six old chests, {{one of which is}} iron-bound and dates from the 13thcentury. There is a ring of eight bells, six of which were recast in 1925 by Taylor's of Loughborough from the metal of the previous four 17th-century bells. The other two bells were added in 1998 and were also supplied by Taylors. The organ was made by J.J.Binns for King's Hall, Stoke-on-Trent in 1912. It was presented to the church by Stoke City Council in 1962 and was rebuilt and installed by Reeves and Merner. The parish registers begin in 1572 and the churchwardens' accounts in 1711, but the latter are incomplete.|$|E
5|$|These designs, {{such as the}} Python Lowracer, a <b>recumbent,</b> {{usually have}} very lax head angles (40° to 65°) and {{positive}} or even negative trail. The builder of a bike with negative trail states that steering the bike from straight ahead forces the seat (and thus the rider) to rise slightly and this offsets the destabilizing effect of the negative trail.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} these circles {{were built in the}} area around modern Dorset, {{typically}} being smaller than those found elsewhere. Most of these Dorset circles are made of sarsen stone, although the Rempstone circle is unique in being made from local sandstone. The southern half of the circle has been destroyed, with five upright and three <b>recumbent</b> stones remaining extant. Having been damaged by eighteenth century clay workings, the monument is at present situated within dense woodland. In 1957, a possible avenue of stones leading to the circle was discovered by ploughing but subsequently removed. Local folklore holds that the stones arrived in their position after being thrown at Corfe Castle by the Devil.|$|E

5|$|Car/SUV – Used {{either as}} a fly-car for rapid {{response}} or for patients who can sit, these are standard car models adapted {{to the requirements of}} the service using them. Some cars are capable of taking a stretcher with a <b>recumbent</b> patient, but this often requires the removal of the front passenger seat, or the use of a particularly long car. This was often the case with early ambulances, which were converted (or even serving) hearses, as {{these were some of the}} few vehicles able to accept a human body in a supine position.|$|E
5|$|In the Mainwaring chapel is the canopied wall tomb of SirWilliam Mainwaring of Baddiley and Peover {{who died}} in 1399. His effigy is in alabaster, it is <b>recumbent</b> and dressed in plate armour as a knight. His head rests on a helm bearing an ass's head and around his neck is a gold collar of esses. The rest of the {{monument}} is in red sandstone. At {{the east end of}} the south aisle is a marble tomb commemorating SirRichard Wilbraham (1578–1643), his son SirThomas Wilbraham (1601–1660) and their wives. It includes the <b>recumbent</b> effigies in marble of SirThomas and his wife, Elizabeth. At the east end of the south aisle is an ancient piscina which is in good condition. In the chancel is another piscina and a sedilia, both of which are damaged. The screen in the Dorfold chapel is dated 1685 while that dividing the chancel from the nave is from a later date. The communion rail is also dated 1685. The brass chandelier dates from the 18thcentury. Stained glass in the east window and in windows of the south aisle is by Kempe and is dated between 1885 and 1888. The reredos includes the Ten Commandments {{to the north of the}} altar and the Lord's Prayer and the Creed to the south. The carved oak pulpion a stone base and the oak eagle lectern date from the 19thcentury.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, if {{the center of}} mass height is behind or below the line, such as on most tandem {{bicycles}} or long-wheel-base <b>recumbent</b> bicycles, as well as cars, it is less likely that the front wheel can generate enough braking force to flip the bike. This means they can decelerate up to nearly the limit of adhesion of the tires to the road, which could reach 0.8 g if the coefficient of friction is 0.8, which is 40% more than an upright bicycle under even the best conditions. Bicycling Science author David Gordon Wilson points out that this puts upright bicyclists at particular risk of causing a rear-end collision if they tailgate cars.|$|E
50|$|<b>Recumbents</b> {{differ from}} more {{traditional}} bicycles {{in that the}} rider sits in a reclining or semi-reclining position with their legs in front. Benefits claimed include greater comfort and aerodynamic efficiency. The luggage carrying arrangements of <b>recumbents</b> are also different, often requiring special panniers and racks designed to fit under and behind the seat to provide similar capacity to a conventional touring bike.|$|R
50|$|Center steered or pivot steered <b>recumbents,</b> such as Flevobikes and Pythons, {{may have}} no {{handlebars}} at all.|$|R

5|$|The monuments {{within the}} cathedral include <b>recumbent</b> figures and {{memorials}} of several abbots and bishops: Abbot Walter Newbery {{who died in}} 1473 and Abbot William Hunt (died 1481) are within 14th-century recesses {{on the north side}} of the Lady Chapel, while the <b>recumbent</b> effigy of Abbot John Newland (died 1515) is in a similar recess on the southern side. The coffin lid of Abbot David (died 1234) is in the north transept. In the north choir aisle is a chest tomb to Bishop Bush (died 1558) which includes six fluted Ionic columns with an entablature canopy. Also honoured are: Thomas Westfield, Bishop of Bristol (1642–44), Thomas Howell (Bishop of Bristol) (1644–45), Gilbert Ironside the elder, Bishop of Bristol (1661–71), William Bradshaw (bishop), Bishop of Bristol (1724–32), Joseph Butler, Bishop of Bristol (1738–1750), John Conybeare, Bishop of Bristol (1750–55) and Robert Gray (bishop of Bristol) (1827–34), who is buried in graveyard attached to the cathedral. The Berkeley family as early benefactors are represented by Maurice de Berkeley (died 1281), *Thomas de Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley (died 1321), Lord Berkeley (died 1326) and Thomas Berkeley (died 1243) who are depicted in military effigies on the south side of the choir aisle, along with the chest tomb of Maurice Berkeley (died 1368).|$|E
5|$|The tomb monument's design {{included}} {{figures of}} the three Virtues in niches, Cossa's family arms, a gilded bronze <b>recumbent</b> effigy laid out above an inscription-bearing sarcophagus supported on corbel brackets, and above it a Madonna and Child in a half-lunette, with a canopy over all. At {{the time of its}} completion, the monument was the tallest sculpture in Florence, and one of very few tombs within the Baptistry or the neighboring Duomo. The tomb monument was the first of several collaborations between Donatello and Michelozzo, and the attribution of its various elements to each of them has been debated by art historians, as have the interpretations of its design and iconography.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{there are}} notable monuments to local dignitaries of the 17th and 18th century. There is a perpendicular reredos showing figures kneeling at a prayer desk flanked by angels to Robert Codrington (died 1618) and his wife. Phillip Freke (died 1729) is commemorated with a marble wall tablet {{in the north}} choir aisle. The oval wall tablet to Rowland Searchfield, English academic and Bishop of Bristol (died 1622) is made of slate. The Newton Chapel, which is between the Chapter House and south choir aisle contains a large dresser tomb of Henry Newton (died 1599) and a <b>recumbent</b> effigy of Sir John Newton (died 1661), {{as well as a}} dresser tomb dedicated to Sir Charles Vaughan who died in 1630.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} the Hour Record may be divided into three categories: UCI Hour Records, <b>Recumbents</b> Hour Records and Streamlined Human Powered Vehicle Records.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{records were}} on the track: unpaced, human-paced and mechanically paced. They were promoted for three classes of bicycle: solos, tandems and unusual machines such as what are now known as <b>recumbents,</b> on which the rider lies horizontal. Distances were imperial and metric, from 440 yards and 500 metres to 24 hours. The UCI banned <b>recumbents</b> in competitions and in record attempts on 1 April 1934. Later changes included restrictions on riding positions {{of the sort that}} affected Graeme Obree in the 1990s and the banning in 2000 of all frames that did not have a seat tube.|$|R
50|$|Bicycle racks are {{installed}} {{on the front of}} all CATA buses, except the trolley-style buses. Each bus can accommodate up to three bicycles. Non-safety bicycles, such as <b>recumbents</b> and tandems, are not allowed.|$|R
5|$|Numerous works, {{from the}} ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of {{inspiration}} for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: <b>recumbent</b> on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She {{is often described as}} looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.|$|E
5|$|The main {{muscular system}} in {{bivalves}} is the posterior and anterior adductor muscles, although the anterior muscles {{may be reduced}} or even lost in some species. These strong muscles connect the two valves and contract to close the shell. They work {{in opposition to the}} ligament which tends to pull the valves apart. In sedentary or <b>recumbent</b> bivalves that lie on one valve, such as the oysters and scallops, the anterior adductor muscle has been lost and the posterior muscle is positioned centrally. In file shells that can swim by flapping their valves, a single, central adductor muscle occurs. These muscles are composed of two types of muscle fibres, striated muscle bundles for fast actions and smooth muscle bundles for maintaining a steady pull.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{pressures}} of other projects, Jagger did not begin work on the memorial until the following year, by which time {{he had decided to}} alter the design. The revised memorial would be a third larger than before, cruciform in plan, and guarded by three bronze soldiers. Jagger initially intended to point the howitzer east, towards the Wellington Arch, but after much discussion—including advice from Lutyens and Sir Reginald Blomfield—it was agreed that the howitzer would point south to produce a pleasing silhouette from the park. A lengthy, year-long debate occurred within the RAWCF as to what inscription should be placed on the memorial, adding to the delay. Jagger then decided that the fourth side of the memorial should feature a dead soldier, a proposal which proved controversial. Although <b>recumbent</b> effigies were not uncommon on tombs and (to a lesser extent) war memorials, a sculpture of a dead soldier at eye level was an unusual and dramatic feature among First World War memorials—architects often preferred abstract, classical designs (such as the Cenotaph) or portrayed death through allegory. Jagger was adamant about the inclusion, even offering to pay for the casting of the additional figure himself. After considerable debate, the RAWCF agreed to the modification. Jagger's work continued to take longer than planned, partially due to shortages of staff, the need to approve each amendment to the plan and practical problems on the site itself. The names of his models for three of the statues are known: William Fosten for the Driver, another ex-gunner called Metcalfe for the Ammunition Carrier, and Lieutenant Eugene Paul Bennett, VC, who fought in the same regiment as Jagger.|$|E
50|$|Luggage {{carriers}} can {{be mounted}} on <b>recumbents</b> and on folding bicycles, but may require customization or additional hardware. Additionally, specialized or customized luggage carriers are often required on bicycles with (rear) disc brakes or full suspension.|$|R
25|$|On tandem {{bicycles}} and other long-wheel-base bicycles (including <b>recumbents</b> and other specialized bicycles), the lower relative {{centre of mass}} makes it virtually impossible for heavy front braking to flip the bicycle; the front wheel would skid first.|$|R
50|$|Randonneuring {{bicycles}} are {{not subject}} to the UCI regulations for road-racing: a cycle is acceptable for randonneuring if it is solely human powered, uses wheels, and {{is no more than a}} metre wide. Tricycles and <b>recumbents,</b> therefore, are allowed.|$|R
5|$|The churchyard {{contains}} 51gravestones {{dating from}} the 17thcentury. The most important monument is the canopied tomb {{of a member of}} the Venables family, which dates from the late 13thcentury; crocketed pinnacles on the canopy date from the 17thcentury. Formerly inside the church, the tomb contains two figures, male and female, with their hands clasped in prayer. The only one of its kind in Cheshire, it is listed GradeII*, and is a scheduled monument. There are two further notable memorials in the churchyard, one to the north and the other to the south of the Venables tomb. Both are in yellow sandstone, date from the medieval period, and include weathered <b>recumbent</b> effigies. The one to the north possibly depicts a cleric with his hands in prayer, and the one to the south is a knight in armour with a missing leg. The churchyard also contains a sundial, consisting of two octagonal steps that were originally the base of a 16th-century cross supporting an 18th-century octagonal pillar. In addition to being listed, it is also a scheduled monument. The gateway to the churchyard dates from the 17thcentury, and consists of a yellow sandstone arch with crocketed pinnacles and a battlemented parapet. All of these structures are listed as GradeII. The churchyard contains the war graves of 16British servicemen, 15of World War I, and one of World War II. A yew tree in the churchyard is believed to be over 1,000years old.|$|E
25|$|A <b>recumbent</b> bicycle has a {{reclined}} chair-like {{seat that}} some riders find {{more comfortable than}} a saddle, especially riders who suffer from certain types of seat, back, neck, shoulder, or wrist pain. <b>Recumbent</b> bicycles may have either under-seat or over-seat steering.|$|E
25|$|Irish <b>recumbent</b> stone circles take {{a rather}} {{different}} form, with the <b>recumbent</b> being small {{and placed in}} an isolated position on the southwest side while the two tallest stones, known as portals, stand opposite on the northeast side. It is highly likely that the <b>recumbent</b> stone circles of northeast Scotland and south-west Ireland are related, given how similar they are, but the geographical distance between them – several hundred kilometers of mountain terrain, bogs and sea – has prompted debate about how exactly the relationship came about. It is possible that rather than there being direct communication between the two locations, the ideas underlying <b>recumbent</b> stone circles were transmitted by a single influential person or {{group of people who}} – for whatever reason – left one location and perhaps settled in the other.|$|E
50|$|Road cycling is an {{activity}} most commonly performed on a bicycle. Modern form {{was invented in}} Germany on Aug 12, 1817 thus this year represents 200th birthday. There are many types of bicycles that are used on the roads including: BMX, <b>recumbents,</b> racing, touring and utility bicycles.|$|R
50|$|Charles Mochet died a {{short time}} after the ban was enacted, still protesting against the UCI decision, and the firm {{continued}} to make <b>recumbents</b> under his widow and, later, Georges Mochet until at least 1941 for {{a limited number of}} customers. Their final versions were a single-chain design named the 'Vélorizontal', the final model using a 'Cyclo' four-speed gear.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>recumbents</b> {{have the}} cranks {{attached}} to a boom fixed to the frame, with a long drive chain for rear wheel drive. However, due to {{the proximity of the}} crank to the front wheel, front wheel drive (FWD) can be an option, and it allows for a much shorter chain. One style requires the chain to twist slightly to allow for steering.|$|R
