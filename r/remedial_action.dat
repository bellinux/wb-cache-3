5|$|In 1996, the Department of Energy, {{which had}} succeeded the Atomic Energy Commission, decided {{that since the}} Dayton sites already had been decontaminated, they did not warrant {{inclusion}} in the Army Corps of Engineers' Formerly Utilized Sites <b>Remedial</b> <b>Action</b> Program (FUSRAP). However, the local community in Dayton were concerned that the cleanup did not meet 21st century environmental standards. Therefore, the state of Ohio asked the United States Congress to have the Army Corps of Engineers conduct a review. This {{was carried out in}} 2004 and 2005. The review concluded that no radioactive contaminants were found that would warrant inclusion in FUSRAP.|$|E
5|$|Toothache is {{the most}} common type of {{orofacial}} pain and, when severe, it is considered a dental emergency, since there may be a significant impact on sleep, eating, and other daily activities. It is one of the most common reasons for emergency dental appointments. Correct diagnosis can sometimes be challenging. The treatment of a toothache depends upon the exact cause, and may involve a filling, root canal treatment, extraction, drainage of pus, or other <b>remedial</b> <b>action.</b> The relief of toothache is considered one of the main responsibilities of dentists. In 2013, 223 million cases of tooth pain occurred as a result of dental caries in permanent teeth and 53 million cases occurred in baby teeth. Historically, the demand for treatment of toothache is thought to have led to the emergence of dental surgery as the first specialty of medicine.|$|E

25|$|A {{remedial}} {{response is}} a long-term action that stops or substantially reduces a release of a hazardous substance that could affect public health or the environment. The term remediation, or cleanup, is sometimes used interchangeably with the terms <b>remedial</b> <b>action,</b> removal action, response action, remedy, or corrective action.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{notification}} of a potentially hazardous waste site, the EPA conducts a Preliminary Assessment/Site Inspection (PA/SI), which involves records reviews, interviews, visual inspections, and limited field sampling. Information from the PA/SI {{is used by}} the EPA to develop a Hazard Ranking System (HRS) score to determine the CERCLA status of the site. Sites that score high enough to be listed typically proceed to a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS). The RI includes an extensive sampling program and risk assessment that defines {{the nature and extent of}} the site contamination and risks. The FS is used to develop and evaluate various remediation alternatives. The preferred alternative is presented in a Proposed Plan for public review and comment, followed by a selected alternative in a ROD. The site then enters into a Remedial Design phase and then the <b>Remedial</b> <b>Action</b> phase. Many sites include Long-Term Monitoring. 5-year reviews once the <b>Remedial</b> <b>Action</b> has been completed are required whenever hazardous substances are left onsite above levels safe for unrestricted use.|$|E

40|$|We {{suggest the}} {{incorporation}} of <b>remedial</b> <b>actions</b> for profit-oriented disassembly lines with stochastic task times. When task times are stochastic, there is a probability {{that some of the}} tasks are not completed within the predefined cycle time. For task incompletions in disassembly lines, pure <b>remedial</b> <b>actions</b> of stopping the line and offline disassembly are proposed along with the hybrid line which is {{a combination of the two}} pure <b>remedial</b> <b>actions.</b> The <b>remedial</b> <b>actions</b> have a significant effect on the expected cycle time as well as the expected profit due to line stoppages and offline disassembly, which together make up the incompletion costs. Stopping the line allows the line to be stopped until all incomplete tasks are completed, while in offline disassembly, incomplete tasks are completed in an offline disassembly area after the core leaves the line. The approaches used in assembly lines for quantifying the associated costs with stopping the line and offline repair for a given line balance are modified and used. Hybrid lines can implement both pure <b>remedial</b> <b>actions</b> for two different task classes: The line is stopped for Finish (F-) tasks and offline disassembly is executed for Pass (P-) tasks. For hybrid lines, we formulate the problem for given line balance so as to maximize the expected profit as a Mixed Integer Programming model. A full enumeration scheme is proposed to derive the hybrid line solution. As partial disassembly is allowed, for offline disassembly and hybrid line, we also formulate and solve the task selection problem so as to determine which incomplete P-tasks to execute during offline disassembly. Our computational study aims to show the significance of incompletion costs, analyze the effect of the base cycle time and demonstrate that hybrid lines are capable of improving the expected profit as well as expected cycle time compared to the pure <b>remedial</b> <b>actions.</b> Stopping the line and hybrid line on average yield 26 % higher expected profits compared to offline disassembly...|$|R
25|$|The EPA {{and state}} {{agencies}} use the Hazard Ranking System (HRS) to calculate a site score (ranging from 0 to 100) based on the actual or potential release of hazardous substances from a site. A score of 28.5 places a site on the National Priorities List, eligible for long-term <b>remedial</b> <b>action</b> (i.e., cleanup) under the Superfund program. , there were 1,328 sites listed; an additional 391 had been delisted, and 55 new sites have been proposed.|$|E
25|$|Dam {{failures}} {{are generally}} catastrophic if {{the structure is}} breached or significantly damaged. Routine deformation monitoring and monitoring of seepage from drains in and around larger dams is useful to anticipate any problems and permit <b>remedial</b> <b>action</b> to be taken before structural failure occurs.

40|$|The {{destructive}} {{impact of}} land degradation {{on social and}} economic endeavours {{of the residents of}} certain urban areas of Abeokuta communities in Ogun State, Nigeria calls for <b>remedial</b> <b>actions</b> to restoring the affected land areas.

Taken <b>remedial</b> <b>actions</b> in this regard included the use of sandbags, debris and wood logs, rubbles and stones, construction of contours and drainages. While each of these actions, in one way or the other, effectively improves the degraded land, it was concluded that the use of rubbles and stones, and drainage construction were sustainably durable for land restoration on the premise that these actions does not allow for water logging or flooding in of the study area. It was however recommended that these sustainable <b>remedial</b> <b>actions</b> should rather be pro-actively taken for prevention of land degradation than being taken as degraded land restoration actions basically because it is much cheaper to prevent environmental degradation than to have the degraded land restored...|$|R
25|$|Evidence of {{that fact}} came in 1939, when Newport {{reported}} to the Bureau that the exploder was giving unexplained prematures. Admiral Furlong arranged for a physicist to visit the station and investigate the failures. For approximately a week, the scientist and his assistants worked with the device. Four sources of prematures were uncovered. Even more significant, the investigator reported to the Bureau that the responsible engineers at Newport were not employing proper tests on the Mark 6.

25|$|The {{two sides}} to this dispute each {{advocated}} for different <b>remedial</b> <b>action.</b> Thompson argued that environmental factors were {{to blame for the}} decline of Pacific salmon, and that the best remedy was to repair the damage to the migration pathway. Ricker believed that over-fishing was the primary threat to the Fraser salmon run, {{and that it would be}} a “gamble” to rely solely on the fishways as a means of conservation. Instead stringent regulations should be placed on salmon fishing, lest they be threatened by over fishing. Further, he feared that conservationists and fishers alike may take the construction of the fishways as an excuse to relax their vigilance, which would consequently threaten the survival of the Fraser salmon.|$|E
