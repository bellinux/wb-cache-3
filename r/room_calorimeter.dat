METHODS: Five healthy children (age 5. 2 +/- 0. 4 y) performed an activity protocol in a <b>room</b> <b>calorimeter,</b> ranging from sedentary to vigorous-intensity activities. Energy expenditure (EE) was calculated from continuous measurements of O 2 -consumption and CO 2 -production using Weir 2 ̆ 7 s formula. Resting EE was defined as EE during the first 30 min of the study where participants were seated while watching television. The children wore an ActiGraph accelerometer on the right and left hip. RESULTS: The protocol was well tolerated by all children, and lasted 150 to 175 min. Further, differences were seen in both EE and accelerometer counts across 3 of the 4 activity intensities.

40|$|Indirect {{whole room}} {{calorimetry}} {{is commonly used}} in studies of human metabolism. These calorimeters can be configured as either push or pull systems. A major obstacle to accurately calculating gas exchange rates in a pull system is that the excurrent flow rate is increased above the incurrent flow rate, because the organism produces water vapor, which also dilutes the concentrations of respiratory gasses in the excurrent sample. A common approach to this problem is to dry the excurrent gasses prior to measurement, but if drying is incomplete, large errors in the calculated oxygen consumption will result. The other major potential source of error is fluctuations in the concentration of O 2 and CO 2 in the incurrent airstream. We describe a novel approach to measuring gas exchange using a pull-type whole <b>room</b> indirect <b>calorimeter.</b> Relative humidity and temperature of the incurrent and excurrent airstreams are measured continuously using high-precision, relative humidity and temperature sensors, permitting accurate measurement of water vapor pressure. The excurrent flow rates are then adjusted to eliminate the flow contribution from water vapor, and respiratory gas concentrations are adjusted to eliminate the effect of water vapor dilution. In addition, a novel switching approach is used that permits constant, uninterrupted measurement of the excurrent airstream while allowing frequent measurements of the incurrent airstream. To demonstrate the accuracy of this approach, we present the results of validation trials compared with our existing system and metabolic carts, {{as well as the}} results of standard propane combustion tests...|$|R

40|$|Circulating {{levels of}} leptin {{may play a}} role in the central {{regulation}} of energy expenditure (EE) and maintenance of body weight. Acute negative changes in energy balance such as 24 hours of fasting induce decreases in both leptin levels and EE. On the other hand, positive changes during overfeeding dietary different interventions cause increases in leptin levels and EE. In our recent studies, a greater decrease in EE during fasting predicted less weight loss under caloric restriction and weight gain in free-living conditions. The physiologic underpinnings of the changes in EE are not known but, as leptin changes also with negative or positive energy balance, it is a good candidate for mediating decrease in EE and influencing future weight gain. Fifty-nine healthy subjects (48 men, age: 37 ± 10 y, body fat by DXA: 28 ± 10 %) with normal glucose regulation were admitted to our clinical research unit to measure 24 h-EE and RQ within a whole <b>room</b> indirect <b>calorimeter</b> during a standard diet in energy balance (EB), 24 h fasting (FST) and five different overfeeding diets. Leptin plasma concentrations were measured in the morning prior to and after FST and five different dietary interventions. The percentage change in 24 h-EE (%EE) was calculated as the difference divided by the 24 h-EE during EB. Follow-up data of weight change were available for 45 subjects after 6 months. As compared to EB, %EE decreased during FST (− 7. 3 ± 4. 4 %, p 0. 24). Furthermore, percent reduction in leptin during FST did not predict weight change at 6 months (p= 0. 77) and no correlation were observed between the change in body weight and the leptin change (%) during the five overfeeding diets (all p value > 0. 3) Although leptin and EE both decrease during fasting and both increase during overfeeding, the reduction/increase in leptin levels was not associated with the concomitant decline/raise in EE or with subsequent weight change.

The two types of environment used in fire testing, open hood and room, may result in very different fire behaviors (Sundström [2007]; Ohlemiller [1995]). In a systematic study on effects of room environment on fire performance of furniture, CBUF report shows wide disparity between furniture calorimeter and <b>room</b> <b>calorimeter</b> results for propagating mattress fires (Sundström [2007]). More flammable mattresses experience major radiative augmentation from the room resulting in rapid fire growth. Ohlemiller (Ohlemiller [1995]) studied fire tests in both environments using NIST furniture calorimeter (oxygen consumption-based calorimeter similar to the system described in ASTM 1590 (ASTM E 1590 - 12 [2999])) and identified two mechanisms by which a room environment could affect the burning behavior of a mattress: through thermal feedback from the smoke layer to the burning surfaces and through oxygen limitation, which depends on the openings {{in the room and}} their effect on ventilation. This susceptibility to room effects makes it difficult to achieve inter-laboratory agreement on data and on the evaluation of the fire hazard for mattresses of similar construction. However, to avoid such a discrepancy in compliance testing of mattresses, the test criteria for the 16 CFR 1633 is relatively severe with PHRR of[*]>[*] 200 [*]kW is an immediate test failure resulting in test termination.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Prepubescent {{children}} may oxidize fatty acids {{more readily than}} adults. Therefore, dietary fat needs would be higher for children compared with adults. The dietary fat recommendations are higher for children 4 to 18 yrs (i. e., 25 to 35 % of energy) compared with adults (i. e., 20 to 35 % of energy). Despite this, many parents and children restrict dietary fat for health reasons. Methods This study assessed whether rates of fat oxidation are similar between prepubescent children and adults. Ten children (8. 7 ± 1. 4 yr, 33 ± 13 kg mean ± SD) in Tanner stage 1 and 10 adults (41. 6 ± 8 yr, 74 ± 13 kg) were fed a weight maintenance diet for three days to maintain body weight and to establish a consistent background for metabolic rate measurements (all foods provided). Metabolic rate was measured on three separate occasions before and immediately after breakfast and for 9 hrs using a hood system (twice) or a <b>room</b> <b>calorimeter</b> (once) where continuous metabolic measurements were taken. Results During all three sessions whole body fat oxidation was higher in children (lower RQ) compared to adults (mean RQ= 0. 84 ±. 016 for children and 0. 87 ±. 02, for adults, p Conclusion These data suggest that fat oxidation relative to total calorie expenditure is higher in prepubescent children than in adults. Consistent with current dietary guidelines, a moderate fat diet is appropriate for children {{within the context of}} a diet that meets their energy and nutrient needs. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Evaluate the {{predictive}} validity of ActiGraph energy expenditure equations and the classification accuracy {{of physical activity}} intensity cut-points in preschoolers. Methods: Forty children aged 4 – 6 years (5. 3 ± 1. 0 years) completed a ~ 150 -min <b>room</b> <b>calorimeter</b> protocol involving age-appropriate sedentary, light and moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activities. Children wore an ActiGraph GT 3 X on the right mid-axillary line of the hip. Energy expenditure measured by room calorimetry and physical activity intensity classified using direct observation were the criterion methods. Energy expenditure was predicted using Pate and Puyau equations. Physical activity intensity was classified using Evenson, Sirard, Van Cauwenberghe, Pate, Puyau, and Reilly, ActiGraph cut-points. Results: The Pate equation significantly overestimated VO 2 during sedentary behaviors, light physical activities and total VO 2 (P< 0. 001). No difference was found between measured and predicted VO 2 during moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activities (P = 0. 072). The Puyau equation significantly underestimated activity energy expenditure during moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activities, light-intensity physical activities and total activity energy expenditure (P< 0. 0125). However, no overestimation of activity energy expenditure during sedentary behavior was found. The Evenson cut-point demonstrated significantly higher accuracy for classifying sedentary behaviors and light-intensity physical activities than others. Classification accuracy for moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activities was significantly higher for Pate than others. Conclusion: Available ActiGraph equations do not provide accurate estimates of energy expenditure across physical activity intensities in preschoolers. Cut-points of ≤ 25 counts⋅ 15 s− 1 and ≥ 420 counts⋅ 15 s− 1 for classifying sedentary behaviors and moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activities, respectively, are recommended...|$|E

40|$|In lean humans, {{increasing}} {{dietary fat}} intake causes {{an increase in}} whole-body fat oxidation and changes in genes that regulate fat oxidation in skeletal muscle, but whether this occurs in obese humans is not known. We compared changes in whole-body fat oxidation and markers of muscle oxidative capacity differ in lean (LN) and obese (OB) adults exposed to a 2 -day high-fat (HF) diet. Ten LN (BMI = 22. 562. 5 kg/m 2, age = 3068 yrs) and nine OB (BMI = 35. 964. 93 kg/m 2, 3865 yrs, Mean 6 SD) were studied in a <b>room</b> <b>calorimeter</b> for 24 hr while consuming isocaloric low-fat (LF, 20 % of energy) and HF (50 % of energy) diets. A muscle biopsy was obtained the next morning following an overnight fast. 24 h respiratory quotient (RQ) did not significantly differ between groups (LN: 0. 9160. 01; OB: 0. 9260. 01) during LF, and similarly decreased during HF in LN (0. 8660. 01) and OB (0. 8560. 01). The expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK 4) and the fatty acid transporter CD 36 increased in both LN and OB during HF. No other changes in mRNA or protein were observed.

40|$|Objectives Examine the {{predictive}} {{validity of the}} activPAL™ metabolic equivalents equation, develop an activPAL™ threshold value to define moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activities, and examine the classification accuracy of the developed moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activities threshold value in 4 - to 6 -year-old children. Design A sample of forty 4 - to 6 -year-old children from the Illawarra region in New South Wales, Australia were included in data analysis. Methods Participants completed a ∼ 150 -min <b>room</b> <b>calorimeter</b> protocol involving age-appropriate sedentary behaviors, light-intensity physical activities and moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activities. activPAL™ accelerometer counts were collected over 15 s epochs. Energy expenditure measured by room calorimetry and direct observation were used as the criterion measure. Predicted metabolic equivalents were calculated using the activPAL™ metabolic equivalents equation (activPAL™ software version 5. 8. 0). Predictive validity was evaluated using dependent-samples t-tests. Participants were randomly allocated into two groups to develop and cross-validate an intensity threshold for moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activities. Receiver operating characteristic curve {{analysis was used to}} determine moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activities threshold. The classification accuracy of the developed threshold was cross-validated using sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic-curve. Results The activPAL™ metabolic equivalents equation significantly overestimated metabolic equivalents during sedentary behaviors and significantly underestimated metabolic equivalents for light-intensity physical activities, moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activities and total metabolic equivalents compared to measured metabolic equivalents (all P 3 ̆c 0. 001). The developed threshold of ≥ 1418 counts per 15 s resulted in good classification accuracy for moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activities. Conclusion The current activPAL™ metabolic equivalents equation requires further development before {{it can be used to}} accurately estimate metabolic equivalents in preschoolers. The developed threshold exhibited acceptable classification accuracy for moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activities; however studies cross-validating this moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activities threshold in free-living preschool-aged children are recommended...|$|E
40|$|Metabolic {{flexibility}} is commonly measured as {{the change in}} respiratory quotient (RQ) from the fasted state to the insulin-stimulated state. This measurement is performed using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and hood calorimetry. A study was performed to evaluate if room calorimetry alone could provide the same results and to examine how diet composition and exercise affect metabolic flexibility. Sixteen healthy males and females stayed overnight in a <b>room</b> <b>calorimeter</b> on four separate occasions. While in the calorimeter, they participated in meal and exercise challenges. The subjects took part {{in one of two}} exercise sessions on the treadmill (high intensity – short duration or low intensity – long duration). They were also provided one of two treatment beverages for lunch (high carbohydrate or high fat shake). Blood samples were collected before and 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after breakfast and lunch to measure glucose, insulin, and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs). Metabolic flexibility was calculated {{in a manner similar to}} the literature, and new metabolic flexibility variables were also considered including the rate of change of RQ (slope) following exercise or a meal and the lag in RQ following exercise. Delta RQ - calculated as the difference between a two hour average night RQ and a two hour average morning RQ - was negatively correlated to % body fat, positively correlated to VO 2 peak, and trending negatively with age. The post-lunch slope of RQ was significantly larger following the high carbohydrate shake compared to the high fat shake. The slope of the increase in RQ following the start of exercise was negatively correlated with age and % body fat and positively correlated with VO 2 peak. This study shows that the non-invasive room calorimetry method can be used to measure many metabolic flexibility variables...|$|E
40|$|Adequate {{sleep is}} crucial during {{childhood}} for metabolic health, and physical and cognitive development. Inadequate sleep can disrupt metabolic homeostasis and alter sleeping energy expenditure (SEE). Functional data analysis methods {{were applied to}} SEE data to elucidate the population structure of SEE and to discriminate SEE between obese and non-obese children. Minute-by-minute SEE in 109 children, ages 5 - 18, was measured in room respiration calorimeters. A smoothing spline method {{was applied to the}} calorimetric data to extract the true smoothing function for each subject. Functional principal component analysis was used to capture the important modes of variation of the functional data and to identify differences in SEE patterns. Combinations of functional principal component analysis and classifier algorithm were used to classify SEE. Smoothing effectively removed instrumentation noise inherent in the <b>room</b> <b>calorimeter</b> data, providing more accurate data for analysis of the dynamics of SEE. SEE exhibited declining but subtly undulating patterns throughout the night. Mean SEE was markedly higher in obese than non-obese children, as expected due to their greater body mass. SEE was higher among the obese than non-obese children (p 0. 1, after post hoc testing). Functional principal component scores for the first two components explained 77. 8 % of the variance in SEE and also differed between groups (p = 0. 037). Logistic regression, support vector machine or random forest classification methods were able to distinguish weight-adjusted SEE between obese and non-obese participants with good classification rates (62 - 64 %). Our results implicate other factors, yet to be uncovered, that affect the weight-adjusted SEE of obese and non-obese children. Functional data analysis revealed differences in the structure of SEE between obese and non-obese children that may contribute to disruption of metabolic homeostasis...|$|E
