The modules would be pre-fabricated, delivered by railcar, barge or special trucks and assembled on-site.

5|$|NuScale {{designs and}} markets small modular nuclear {{reactors}} that the Department of Energy {{expects to be}} commercially available around 2025. Its designs use the light water approach to cooling and power generation that is common in conventional nuclear plants. Water is heated by the nuclear core {{at the base of}} the <b>reactor</b> <b>vessel.</b> Heated water flows upwards inside the riser, then down over steam generators. As heat is transferred to steam generators, the water becomes cooler and denser, sinking back to the bottom of the device, where the cycle is repeated. Heat transferred to the steam generators is used to create steam that turns a turbine, which drives an electrical generator.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of {{adequate}} cooling, the materials inside of the <b>reactor</b> <b>vessel</b> overheat and deform as they undergo thermal expansion, and the reactor structure fails once the temperature reaches the melting point of its structural materials. The corium melt then accumulates {{at the bottom of}} the <b>reactor</b> <b>vessel.</b> In the case of adequate cooling of the corium melt, the melt can solidify and the spread of damage is limited to the reactor itself. However, corium may melt through the <b>reactor</b> <b>vessel</b> and flow out or be ejected as a molten stream by the pressure inside the <b>reactor</b> <b>vessel.</b> The <b>reactor</b> <b>vessel</b> failure may be caused by heating of its vessel bottom by the corium melt, resulting first in creep failure and then in breach of the vessel. Cooling water from above the corium layer, in sufficient quantity, may obtain a thermal equilibrium below the metal creep temperature, without <b>reactor</b> <b>vessel</b> failure.|$|E

25|$|However the {{dynamics}} of the movement of corium in and outside the <b>reactor</b> <b>vessel</b> is highly complex, and the number of possible scenarios is wide; slow drip of melt into an underlying water pool can result in complete quenching, while the fast contact of a large mass of corium with water may result in a destructive steam explosion.

25|$|August 2002: a {{widespread}} falsification scandal starting in {{that led to}} the shut down of all Tokyo Electric Power Company’s 17 nuclear reactors; Tokyo Electric's officials had falsified inspection records and attempted to hide cracks in <b>reactor</b> <b>vessel</b> shrouds in 13 of its 17 units.|$|E
50|$|The main {{function}} of the core shroud is to direct the current of water flow inside of the <b>reactor</b> pressure <b>vessel.</b> Cold water is pumped into the <b>reactor</b> pressure <b>vessel</b> from an outside water source. The cold water flows down in between {{the wall of the}} <b>reactor</b> pressure <b>vessel</b> and the outside wall of the core shroud where it meets the fuel assemblies. It is here that the cold water is heated, and the heated water flows back up the gap between the wall of the <b>reactor</b> pressure <b>vessel</b> and the outside wall of the core shroud. This creates steam, since the water is heated, which is then used to drive the steam turbine, which powers the generator and creates electricity. By directing the cold water into the <b>reactor</b> pressure <b>vessel,</b> and allowing the heated water to rise and evaporate, the core shroud will have successfully cooled the nuclear reactions.|$|R

25|$|On October 17, 1980, 100,000 {{gallons of}} Hudson River water leaked into the Indian Point 2 {{containment}} building from the fan cooling unit, undetected by a safety device designed to detect hot water.

25|$|The coolant {{is pumped}} around the primary circuit by {{powerful}} pumps. After picking up heat as it passes through the reactor core, the primary coolant transfers heat in a steam generator to water in a lower pressure secondary circuit, evaporating the secondary coolant to saturated steam — in most designs 6.2MPa (60atm, 900psia), 275°C (530°F) — {{for use in the}} steam turbine.

25|$|Experts soon {{agreed that}} the cause was a {{hydrogen}} explosion.

There is no way to replace the gargantuan highly-radioactive vessels, nor any proven method to fix the increasing fragility of the steel.
