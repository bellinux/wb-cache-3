40|$|In {{artificial}} environments like spacecraft, hyperbaric chambers inhospitals {{and deep}} sea diving　equipment, the　flammability or ease　of　ignition　of　flammable　materials increases under the influence　of enriched-oxygen and/or elevated partial pressure of oxygen. 　For safety, the insulated wire used under these environments {{needs to be}} insulated with nonflammable and heat-resistant resin, and connected to the overcurrent relay. When connected, the charactor of the overcurrent relay must agree with the temperature rise of the insulated wire under artificial environments. But, the temperature rise of insulated wire under artificial environments has not been studied up to the present. 　In this paper， the authors reveal the temperature rise on the conductor of insulated wire depending on pressure and gases, and the approximate equations of the <b>current</b> <b>rating,</b> minimum <b>thermal</b> damaging <b>current</b> and heat transmission coefficient by natural convection were obtained from that temperature rise...|$|R

Asymptotic parallel and antiparallel tails of the nonequilibrium distribution to an average <b>thermal</b> <b>current</b> are identical to ones of equilibrium distribution with different temperatures. These temperatures characterizing the tails are dependent on a characteristic length in which a memory of dynamics is completely erased by several particle collisions. This property of the tails of nonequilibrium distribution is confirmed in other thermal transport systems. In addition, statistical properties of a particle trapped by a harmonic potential in a steady thermal conducting state are also studied.

40|$|The {{detrimental}} effect {{of climate change}} induced bleaching on Caribbean coral reefs has been widely documented in recent decades. Several {{studies have suggested that}} increases in the abundance of thermally tolerant endosymbionts may ameliorate the effect of climate change on reefs. Symbionts that confer tolerance to temperature also reduce the growth rate of their coral host. Here, we show, using a spatial ecosystem model, that an increment in the abundance of a thermally tolerant endosymbiont (D 1 a) is unlikely to ensure the persistence of Caribbean reefs, or to reduce their rate of decline, due to the concomitant reduction in growth <b>rate</b> under <b>current</b> <b>thermal</b> stress predictive scenarios. Furthermore, our results suggest that given the documented vital rates of D 1 a-dominated corals, increasing dominance of D 1 a in coral hosts may have a {{detrimental effect}} by reducing the resilience of Caribbean reefs, and preventing their long-term recovery. This is because Caribbean ecosystems appear to be highly sensitive to changes in the somatic growth rate of corals. Alternative outcomes might be expected in systems with different community-level dynamics such as reefs in the Indo-Pacific, where the ecological costs of reduced growth rate might be far smaller...|$|R

40|$|According to {{constructal}} area-point {{heat conduction}} model, the <b>thermal</b> <b>current</b> {{in the high}} conductive link increases only at conjunction points. If the optimum number of the lower order constructs which formed higher order constructs is finite, {{the number of the}} conjunction points is finite and the <b>thermal</b> <b>current</b> in the high conductive link increases discretely. The cross-section of the high conductive link should be adapted with the change of the <b>thermal</b> <b>current</b> through it. For minimizing the thermal resistance, the more <b>thermal</b> <b>current</b> flows into the high conducting path, the wider the cross-section of the high conducting path should be. A new method based on discrete variable cross-section conducting path is introduced in this paper. Both the case of the elemental area with constant cross-section conducting path and the case of the elemental area with variable cross-section conducting path are discussed. The results show that the minimum of maximum thermal resistance which is obtained through assembling can be obtained by changing the cross-section conducting path based on constructal theory and in each assembly, the optimized minimum thermal resistance based on variable cross-section conducting path element is smaller than that based on constant cross-section conducting path element. When the optimum number of the lower order constructs (niÂ [greater-or-equal, slanted]Â  4) which formed higher order constructs is fixed, at the same construct, the constructal optimal method based on discrete variable cross-section conducting path can reduce the thermal resistance further.
