50|$|Although Ignace was {{incorporated}} in 1908, {{it was something}} of a latecomer to some modern conveniences, such as <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> <b>telephone,</b> which did not arrive to the town until 1956.|$|E
50|$|The {{telegraph}} keys {{or telephone}} dial creates trains of on-off current pulses {{corresponding to the}} digits 1-9, and 0 (which sends 10 pulses). This equipment originally consisted of two telegraph keys engaged by knife switches, and evolved into the <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> <b>telephone.</b>|$|E

50|$|In the {{earliest}} days of telephone technology, prior {{to the development of the}} <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> <b>telephone,</b> all telephone calls were operator-assisted. To place a call, the caller was required to pick up the telephone receiver, sometimes turn a magneto crank, and wait for the telephone operator to answer. The caller would then ask to be connected to the number they wished to call, and the operator would make the required connection manually, by means of a switchboard.|$|E
50|$|Although {{push-button}} touch-tone telephones {{made their}} debut {{to the general}} public in 1963, the <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> <b>telephone</b> still was common for many years. In the 1970s the majority of telephone subscribers still had rotary phones, which in the Bell System of that era were leased from telephone companies instead of being owned outright. Adoption of the push-button phone was steady, but {{it took a long time}} for them to appear in some areas. At first it was primarily businesses that adopted push-button phones. By 1979, the touch-tone phone was gaining popularity, but it wasn't until the 1980s that the majority of customers owned push-button telephones in their homes; by the 1990s, it was the overwhelming majority.|$|E

The setting is Halloween themed with skulls, candles and dim lighting through out the area. All girls then {{stand in front of}} a hotel, with different colored suitcases and each wearing coats while dancing. Lauren then sings as she holds a <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> <b>telephone</b> in her hand. The scene intensifies as rapid shots of the girls appear on screen. Synchronized choreography is performed by all the girls, in front of the hotel. Interchanged scenes consist of movie clips and Normani and Dinah behaving in a seductive way as the monsters make their way towards the halls.|$|E
50|$|Tritium {{lights are}} also found in some old <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> <b>telephones,</b> though due to their age they no longer produce a useful amount of light. Tritium lights or beta lights were {{formerly}} used in fishing lures. Some flashlights have slots for tritium vials so that the flashlight can be easily located in the dark.|$|R
50|$|A {{vertical}} {{service code}} (VSC) is {{a sequence of}} digits and the signals star (*) and number sign (#) <b>dialed</b> on a <b>telephone</b> keypad or <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> to enable or disable certain telephony service features. Some vertical service codes require the <b>dialing</b> of a <b>Telephone</b> number after the code sequence. On a touch tone telephone, the codes are usually initiated with the star key, resulting in the commonly used name star codes. On <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> <b>telephones</b> the star is replaced by dialing 11.|$|R
50|$|Although DTMF was {{the driving}} {{technology}} implemented in push-button telephones, some telephone manufacturers used push-button keypads to generate pulse dial signaling. Before {{the introduction of}} touch-tone telephone sets, the Bell System sometimes used the term push-button telephone to refer to key system <b>telephones,</b> which were <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> <b>telephones</b> that also had a set of push-buttons to select one of multiple telephone circuits, or to activate other features.|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the Dial-A-Phone (D-A-P) instructional package plus a least intrusive prompt hierarchy was {{compared with that of}} a least intrusive prompt hierarchy alone for teaching adults with developmental disabilities (DVDs) to match digits of personal phone numbers with digits on a <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> <b>telephone.</b> Instructional programs were administered to a 36 -yr-old man with moderate DVDs and to a 44 -yr-old man with Down syndrome and severe DVDs. The dependent variable was the percentage of digits matched independently per session (21 digits per session). Results suggest that although a least intrusive prompt hierarchy alone produced findings similar to the D-A-P plus prompts procedure for 1 S, the D-A-P plus prompts package was the most effective in helping both Ss to match digits independently...|$|E
40|$|Inspired, {{during a}} three month stay in India {{in the summer}} of 2012, by the ubiquity of the mobile phone in that country and its long and complex life span in {{contrast}} to the increasingly short life span of the mobile phone in the west, my research addresses questions of obsolescence, mobility, communications networks and innovation. Initially grounded in the real-world conditions of rapid mobile phone obsolescence, my research subsequently adopted critical design and performance methods and culminated in two projects, stereoPHONEic and textDIAL that demonstrate ways to repurpose so-called obsolete <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> <b>telephone</b> hardware, combining it with other available technologies, and even human beings at times, to recreate smartphone functionality. Together with a literature review (addressing the mobile phone in India, ubiquitous computing, persistence versus obsolescence and actor-network-theory) and a survey of relevant art, design and performance work, this thesis describes the process and outcomes of my research...|$|E
5000|$|Telephone callers will {{recognize}} an automated attendant system {{as one that}} greets calls incoming to an organization with a recorded greeting of the form, [...] "Thank you for calling .... If you know your party's extension, you may dial it any time during this message." [...] Callers who have a touch tone (DTMF) phone can dial an extension number or, in most cases, wait for operator ("attendant") assistance. Since the telephone network does not transmit the DC signals from <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> <b>telephones</b> (except for audible clicks), callers who have <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> phones {{have to wait for}} assistance.|$|R
50|$|In 1951, the Verendrye Electric Cooperative {{board of}} {{directors}} established the Souris River Telephone Mutal Aid Corporation to bring telephone service to those living {{in the rural areas}} of McHenry and Ward Counties. The first telephone exchange, the town of Martin, was purchased for $500 and had 82 telephone customers. In 1960, Minot Air Force Base became SRT's largest phone exchange, and by 1970 <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> <b>telephones</b> were replaced with touch pad style phones. In 1980, SRT began to sell cable television service, first available in the town of Westhope.|$|R
50|$|NorthernTel's +1-705-642 {{exchange}} at 5 Cameron Avenue, Swastika was {{a throwback}} to a simpler era in which mechanical stepping switches rotated in response to <b>dial</b> pulses from <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> <b>telephones.</b> As a step-by-step exchange offers none of the calling features of an electronic or digital switch, these are becoming increasingly rare as mechanical switching equipment is displaced by electronics. This one held out {{a little longer than}} most as it was a small community in formerly independent telco territory, but was ultimately replaced by a digital remote station SWASONXTRSA controlled from Timmins TMNSONXTCG0.|$|R

50|$|Dialling, (dialing in US English), is {{the action}} of {{initiating}} a telephone call by operating the <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> or the <b>telephone</b> keypad of a telephone.|$|R
50|$|Note: The four-digit {{numbers are}} not {{implemented}} in some areas. The codes prefixed with an asterisk (*) symbol {{are intended for}} use on Touch-Tone telephones, whereas the four-digit numbers prefixed 11xx are intended for use on <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> <b>telephones,</b> where the Touch-Tone * symbol is not available.Not all NANP countries use the same codes. For example, the emergency telephone number is not always 911: Trinidad and Tobago and Dominica uses 999, as in the United Kingdom. The country of Barbados uses 211 for police force, 311 for fire, and 511 for ambulance, while Jamaica uses 114 for directory assistance, 119 for police force, and 110 for fire and ambulance services.|$|R
5000|$|In the United Kingdom {{the letter}} [...] "O" [...] was {{combined}} with the digit [...] "0" [...] rather than [...] "6". Older Australian <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> <b>telephones</b> also had letters, but the combinations were often printed in the center plate adjacent to the number. The Australian letter-to-number mapping was A=1, B=2, F=3, J=4, L=5, M=6, U=7, W=8, X=9, Y=0, so the phone number BX 3701 was in fact 29 3701. When Australia changed to all-numeric telephone numbers, a mnemonic to help people associate letters with numbers was the sentence, [...] "All Big Fish Jump Like Mad Under Water eXcept Yabbies." [...] However, such letter codes were not used in all countries.|$|R
5000|$|United States and Canada: Vertical {{service code}} *69; 1169 on <b>rotary</b> phone/pulse <b>dial</b> <b>telephones.</b> The prompt voice behind most U.S. AT&T {{implementations}} of this feature is Pat Fleet. Where available, it is offered on a per-call charge (typically 50¢) or an unlimited-use monthly subscription {{for a few}} dollars.|$|R
5000|$|Low digits: in {{the days}} of <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> <b>telephones,</b> using only those digits that require the least dial {{rotation}} (1 and 2) permitted a dial lock in hole 3 to effectively disable unauthorised access to the telephone network without preventing access to the emergency number 112. The same choice also maximised <b>dialling</b> speed. Additionally, <b>telephone</b> systems used pulse dialling instead of later DTMF tones; briefly activating the hook once has the same effect as dialling [...] "1", so repeatedly pushing the hook might result in calling 1-1-1. For this reason, Germany's police emergency number was changed from 111 to 110. With numeric keypads, pressing only the first and second button on the keypad is marginally easier in a difficult situation than other keys.|$|R

50|$|Despite {{its early}} {{importance}} {{as a share}} of the worldwide telephone system, few of the NANP's codes, such as 911, have been adopted outside the system. Determining that 911 requires unnecessary rotation time on <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> <b>telephones,</b> the European Union has adopted its own standardized number of 112, while countries in Asia {{and the rest of the}} world use a variety of other two- or three-digit emergency telephone number combinations. The 112 code is gaining prevalence because of its preprogrammed presence in mobile telephones that conform to the European GSM standard. The European Union and many other countries have chosen the International Telecommunication Union's 00 as their international access number instead of 011. The toll-free prefix 800 has been widely adopted elsewhere, including as the international toll-free country code. It is often preceded by a 0 rather than a 1 in many countries where 0 is the trunk prefix.|$|R
50|$|After {{leaving the}} employ of his {{father-in-law}} J.J. Hill, Sam Hill undertook {{a variety of}} business ventures and other projects, with varied results. His Seattle Gas and Electric Company was continually in hard-fought rivalry with other utilities, most notably head-on competition with the Citizens' Light and Power Company, whose leadership included several defectors from Hill's company. Ultimately, after a price war, {{he was able to}} sell the company's gas facilities to the consolidated Seattle Lighting Company in 1904 on favorable terms. Another venture into utilities was less successful: the Home Telephone Company of Portland, Oregon pioneered <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> <b>telephones</b> in the region, but ultimately this independent telephone company lost out to the better-integrated Bell System. Its stockholders were wiped out, and bondholders—Hill himself was the largest of these—ultimately received 70 cents on the dollar. Another business failure of his was the Deep Water Coal and Iron Company in Alabama. At the end of his life, the shares in this last enterprise were worthless, {{due in part to the}} Great Depression.|$|R
50|$|Pulse dialing is a {{signaling}} {{technology in}} telecommunications {{in which a}} direct current local loop circuit is interrupted according to a defined coding system for each signal transmitted, usually a digit. This lends the method the often used name loop disconnect dialing. In the most common variant of pulse dialing, decadic dialing, each of the ten Arabic numerals are encoded in a sequence of up to ten pulses. The most common version decodes the digits 1 through 9, as one to nine pulses, respectively, and the digit 0 as ten pulses. Historically, the most common device to produce such pulse trains is the <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> of the <b>telephone,</b> lending the technology another name, <b>rotary</b> <b>dialing.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{calculator}} had spoked metal wheel dials, {{with the}} digit 0 through 9 displayed around {{the circumference of}} each wheel. To input a digit, the user placed a stylus in the corresponding space between the spokes and turned the dial until a metal stop at the bottom was reached, {{similar to the way}} the <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> of a <b>telephone</b> is used. This displayed the number in the windows {{at the top of the}} calculator. Then, one simply redialed the second number to be added, causing the sum of both numbers to appear in the accumulator.|$|R
5000|$|Varèse {{designed}} {{a very complex}} spatialization scheme which was synchronized to the film. Prefiguring the acousmonium style of sound projection, hundreds of speakers were controlled by sound projectionists {{with a series of}} <b>rotary</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>dials.</b> Each dial could turn on five speakers at a time out of a bank of 12. Many estimates of the pavilion's sound system go as high as 450 speakers, but based on the limitations of the switching system and the number of projectionists used, an estimate of 350 seems more reasonable.|$|R
