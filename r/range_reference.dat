40|$|SUMMARY. The current {{interest}} in reference evaluation {{has its roots}} in the unobtrusive testing begun twenty years ago. Evaluation before that was centered on criteria of quantity rather than quality. When unobtrusive testing began reporting accuracy rates hovering in the 50 % <b>range,</b> <b>reference</b> services responded by exploring a vari-ety of techniques to measure quality of service including unobtrusive testing, patron surveys, and peer review. Methods to improve refer-ence service, such as training workshops, peer coaching, and chang-es in organizational climate are also beginning to be critically exam-ined.

30|$|BEV {{operation}} {{is a complex}} process, which involves driving conditions and human factors besides battery status. Based on the mechanism modeling methods, reference [16] attempted to use published vehicle parameters and driving range information {{as a basis for}} establishing a simplified BEV power train model. The results of driving range estimation were compared with published manufacturer specifications under various route and driving conditions. The significant correlations among the experimental results were also examined. Reference [17] analyzed the operational mechanism regarding the complexity and nonlinearity of the BEV system. A fuzzy transform method is adopted to estimate the driving <b>range.</b> <b>Reference</b> [18] investigated the operation characteristics of inductive power transfer systems in BEV and regarded it as an important affecting factor for the driving range. A corresponding mechanism model was established to estimate the driving <b>range.</b> <b>Reference</b> [19] attempted to estimate the driving range based on energy consumption information and driving conditions. A model of driving range was established through analysis of the operational mechanism. However, the human factors, namely driving behavior, cannot be involved in this method. Moreover, considering topography and the traffic conditions of the road network, reference [20] proposed several linear models to determine energy expenditure equations under different conditions. Dijkstra’s graph search algorithm was introduced to identify the route with minimum energy consumption. The result was a routing system that could extend the driving range by calculating the minimum energy route to a destination. Once again, the human factors are not reflected in the models that are based on the mechanism analysis. When driving a vehicle, the driving behavior of the driver is not a certain factor, because it can be affected by many external and uncertain factors. Due to the human factors, the operation of BEV is a typical complex system. It is very difficult, even impossible, to predict the driving behavior through a deterministic method, such as the mechanism analysis. Therefore, the complexity of the BEV operation cannot be presented in the models as mentioned above.|$|E
