5|$|In 1953, Woodruff {{moved to}} Dunedin {{to take up}} a {{position}} as the Chair of Surgery at the University of Otago Dunedin School of Medicine, New Zealand's only medical school at that time. Woodruff had earlier failed in his applications for the corresponding position at St Mary's in London and St Andrews University in Edinburgh. While in Dunedin, Woodruff conducted research on the use of white blood cells to increase tolerance for allografts in rats. This line of research proved to be largely unsuccessful, but some of Woodruff's other projects did well. Among his more important accomplishments in the period, Woodruff established a frozen skin bank for burn treatment. As there was no plastic surgeon in the city, Woodruff ended up being responsible for treating burns. He also worked on the phenomenon known as <b>runt</b> <b>disease</b> (graft versus host disease). Although Woodruff had been productive in four years in New Zealand, Dunedin had a population of roughly 100,000, so there were not enough people in the region to supply a clinical medical school, so he began to look for an appointment elsewhere.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY-Acute <b>runt</b> <b>disease</b> induced in Sprague-Dawley and Wistar Fl rats at ~ {{weeks of}} age is {{characterized}} by death of the rats within 30 days after allogenic transplantation. In a previous study we observed that treatment with metopirone not only reduced the death rate from acute <b>runt</b> <b>disease</b> but also prolonged survival For 2 years under standard laboratory conditions. These survivors appeared almost normal, except For some residual loss of hair, but visceral examination revealed splenomegaly and moderate lymphadenopathy. The pathologic changes in chronic <b>runt</b> <b>disease</b> in rats differ From those previously well-documented in acute <b>runt</b> <b>disease.</b> The pathologic changes observed in the survivors were principally restricted to lymphoid tissues. After 12 months, germinal centers reappeared in the spleen of surviving runted rats, and the structural pattern of the Follicle was modiRed {{by the presence of}} numerous reticuloendothelial cells. These cells were large, had irregular nuclear morphology, and presented large chromatin bodies as well as occasional mitosis. In contrast to studies reported b...|$|E

40|$|Reticuloendotheliosis viruses (REVs) ` are a {{group of}} avian retroviruses that infect chickens, turkeys, and ducks (1). The {{prototype}} virus of this group is reticuloendotheliosis virus strain T, REV-T(REV-A), a mixture of a replicationdefective virus (REV-T) that induces acute neoplastic disease and a nondefective helper virus (REV-A) capable of inducing an immunosuppressive <b>runting</b> <b>disease</b> (2 - 4). REV-A and other nondefective REVS can be distinguished from REV-T by their ability to replicate in vitro in fibroblasts and their inability to induce acute neoplastic disease in vivo (5, 6). Some nondefective REVS, chick syncytial virus (CSV) and REV-A, induce a bursal-dependent B cell lymphoma that is indistinguishable from avian leukosis virus (ALV) -induced lymphoid leukosis (6, 7). These tumors develop after a long latent period, are monoclonal, and are characterized by proviral insertion within the c-myc locus (8, 9). In contrast, REV-T causes an acute neoplastic disease known as reticuloendotheliosis because the prominent cell in the original neoplastic lesion was morphologically identified as reticuloendothelial (10).

40|$|SUMMARY-In rats with <b>runt</b> <b>disease,</b> spleen cell {{transfer}} raised {{initially the}} plasma corticosterone level, but it decreased to subnormal level the 2 d day. Thereafter, the increase again became evident and remained almost {{twice that of}} intralitter control rats. It varied from 22. 4 - 40. 9 Jlg/ 1 00 ml. These high levels were generally associated with intensity of clinical symptoms. Of rats with <b>runt</b> <b>disease,</b> 1000 / 0 (11 / 11), 98 % (11 / 12), and 100 % (18 / 18) had elevated plasma corticosterone levels 7, 11,and 25 days after cellular transfer, respectively. After 26 days, the plasma corticosterone level declined to normal range. These results show that <b>runt</b> <b>disease,</b> induced by injection of parental spleen cells into rats, hod a biphasic pattern of cor-ticosterone secretion. These elevated levels resulted from "immunological stress " by cellular transFer in the initial stage, but aggravated the process of <b>runt</b> <b>disease</b> at the terminal stage. -J Nat Cancer Inst 48 : 119 - 123, 1972.

40|$|One of the {{possible}} consequences of the graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR) 1 in animals and man is <b>runt</b> <b>disease</b> or acute graft-versus-host (GVH) disease (GVHD). It is frequently fatal and produces a variety of symptoms, which include atrophy of the skin and the gastrointestinal mucosa and hypoplasia of the hemopoietic and lymphoid tissues manifested by anemia and immunodeficiency, respectively (1, 2). Donor T cells {{are known to be}} responsible for the induction of <b>runt</b> <b>disease</b> (3, 4). However, the mechanisms by which T cells induce the pathological symptoms of <b>runt</b> <b>disease</b> are poorly understood. Another possible outcome of the GVHR is a chronic GVHD which can lead to different conditions, such as lymphadenopathy (5, 6), immune complex glomerulonephritis (6, 7), and formation of multiple autoantibodies (8 - 11). Previous analyses performed in nonirradiated Fa mice have shown that there are two minimal, essential requirements for the induction of the symptoms of chronic GVttD: immunocompetent T lymphocytes must be present in the donor cell inoculum and they must be able to react to incompatible H- 2 structures of the recipient (5 - 7, 9, 11) ...|$|E
40|$|Female BALB/c (H- 2 d, Mlsb) mice alloimmunized {{prior to}} and during syngeneic {{pregnancy}} with DBA/ 2 (H- 2 d, Mlsa) splenocytes gave rise to offspring with severely reduced responsiveness in adult life to DBA/ 2 stimulation in vitro mixed lymphocyte cultures. The offspring of the hyperimmunized mothers were also tolerant to neonatal challenge {{with large numbers of}} DBA/ 2 splenocytes, which resulted in <b>runting</b> <b>disease</b> of control neonatal BALB/c mice. Both challenged and unchallenged offspring of the immunized BALB/c mothers were hyporesponsive to DBA/ 2 but both stimulated and responded to normal BALB/c lymphocytes, indicating alteration in their T-cell repertoire. There was no reduction in the V beta 6 -positive thymocyte subpopulation in the challenged or unchallenged offspring of the alloimmunized BALB/c mothers compared to normal controls, suggesting that hyporesponsiveness to DBA/ 2 is not due to thymic deletion of Mlsa-responsive clones. Examination of the T-cell subset composition of the hydrocortisone-resistant thymocytes and peripheral lymphocytes of the challenged and unchallenged groups of experimental mice revealed large increases in the percentage of Lyt- 2 + T cells, sometimes accompanied by a decrease in the L 3 T 4 + T-cell subset compared to age-matched control BALB/c. Lymphocytes from the hyporesponsive mice specifically suppressed the proliferative responses of control BALB/c to DBA/ 2 but not to AKR.

40|$|The {{immunologic}} {{competence of}} spleen cells of mice, as assessed by their graft versus host capabilities, increases to 35 days {{of age and}} beyond. Thymectomy at any point along this continuum of development produces "immunologic arrest;" the peripheral lymphoid tissues of such mice do not show significant increases in activity as the animals mature, nor is there appreciable loss of activity up to 6 months after surgery. Adult spleen cells from mice thymectomized at 1 to 24 hours of age have a greatly reduced ability to induce <b>runt</b> <b>disease.</b> Five million spleen cells from immunologically mature animals will uniformly cause fatal <b>runt</b> <b>disease</b> in neonatal recipients, but this same number of cells from neonatally thymectomized animals produces almost no <b>runt</b> <b>disease.</b> When the dosage of cells from neonatally thymectomized C 57 Bl mice is increased to 20 million, {{about half of the}} A recipients develop <b>runt</b> <b>disease.</b> Thus, the defect is a quantitative one. Spleen cells from neonatally thymectomized mice will induce tolerance of skin grafts from the donor strain. In one recalcitrant strain combination, C 57 Bl to A, use of spleen cells from neonatally thymectomized donors as the tolerance-inducing inoculum permits survival of the recipients, which usually die with severe <b>runt</b> <b>disease,</b> but does not induce tolerance. Cell free extracts of spleen and thymus tissue, including "promine" of Szent-Gyorgyi et al., did not affect the runting syndrome or the immunologic reactivity of neonatally thymectomized mice. When syngeneic thymic tissue is grafted into neonatally thymectomized mice, or the animals are given viable syngeneic spleen or thymus cells, the majority of the animals escape the early mortality characteristic of this group. Administration of syngeneic spleen cells from adult donors and grafting of syngeneic neonatal thymus provide restoration of homograft immunity and graft versus host reactivity of the peripheral lymphoid tissues in most of the neonatally thymectomized animals. Thymus cells rarely provide significant restoration of these parameters. Allogeneic thymus grafts also restore neonatally thymectomized mice. Such animals are chimeric: the immunologically competent cells of their peripheral lymphoid tissues are chiefly of host origin as determined by the discriminant spleen assay, but in many instances a significant donor component is also demonstrable in this system. These chimeric animals accept skin grafts from both donor and host strains. A degree of reconstitution has also been attained by grafting of allogeneic adult spleen in neonatally thymectomized animals. The discriminant spleen assay indicates that cells of the donor strain predominate in the peripheral lymphoid tissues of such mice...|$|E

The timing of the initial antigenic stimulation was of importance, and animals started on their course of injections at an age of 48 hours or older showed no effect. There was a considerable variation in {{the severity of the}} disease within litters and from one litter to another. This variation could not be ascribed to a difference in susceptibility between sexes, since both male and female mice were observed to runt under appropriate conditions. Germ-free ICR mice were much more resistant to the runting phenomenon than conventional animals of the same strain, but could be induced to runt by injection of the staphylococcal vaccine suspended in homologous antiserum.

40|$|Previously (1) it was {{demonstrated}} that, in the strain combination of mice under study, acquired tolerance to skin homografts was lost with increasing age. The chronic rejection pattern suggested a host versus graft reaction which increased in severity with time, {{culminating in the}} elimination of donor lymphoid cells and skin grafts. Since the rejection of homologous tissues by normal animals is accompanied by pronounced histological changes in the lymphoid organs of the host (2 [...] 4), the present studies were undertaken to detect similar histological indications of a host versus graft reaction in seemingly tolerant mice and to determine the onset of such a reaction. The strain combination used was particularly advantageous because a standard dose of 5 million adult CBA strain spleen cells, injected intravenously into newborn C 3 H mice, will result in 100 per cent tolerance without <b>runt</b> <b>disease</b> (5, 6).

Histologic lesions were observed in 69 per cent of adequately thymectomized animals and 17 per cent of normal controls, and involved lymph nodes, spleen, liver, lungs, kidneys, joints, heart, and skin.

40|$|Newborn rats of one inbred strain {{were given}} an {{intracardiac}} injection of adult thoracic duct lymphocytes from another inbred strain. It was found that {{although there was a}} direct relationship between the number of small lymphocytes injected and the incidence of fatal <b>runt</b> <b>disease,</b> there was no particular relationship between the large lymphocyte content of an inoculum and its runt-inducing potentiality. Using tritiated thymidine and an autoradiographic technique, the small lymphocytes in the inoculum were labelled and found to migrate in large numbers into the cortex of the lymph nodes and into the Peyer's patches of the host animal, and in smaller numbers into the white pulp of the spleen. Within 24 hours isotope, previously present in the DNA of small lymphocytes, appeared in a number of the large pyroninophilic cells which were a characteristic feature of the spleen and lymph nodes in this early phase of <b>runt</b> <b>disease.</b> When the large lymphocytes in the inoculum were labelled they were found to migrate to the red pulp of the spleen, medulla of the lymph nodes, and the Peyer's patches and the lamina propria of the small intestine. Later some labelled small lymphocytes appeared at these sites. These findings suggest that: (1) Some small lymphocytes are immunologically competent cells, and (2) After introduction into the circulation of a newborn rat, these same small lymphocytes are the first cells to react with the antigens of the host, and in the process they become transformed into large pyroninophilic cells capable of division. The large lymphocytes seem to play little part in this initiating of an immunological response, but do give rise to some small lymphocytes...|$|E
40|$|The thymus, spleen, and {{lymph nodes}} were studied in <b>runt</b> <b>disease</b> induced by a graft of {{intravenously}} injected homologous splenic cells into newborn rats and mice. Adult Long-Evans cells (70 x 106) were injected into Sprague-Dawley rats. Adult DBA cells (7 x 106) were injected into C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Runted rats were sacrificed at 14 to 28 days of age; mice at 10 to 20 days. The thymic cortex is depleted of small lymphocytes. Those remaining are severely damaged and phagocytized. Evidence of damage includes swelling of mitochondria, myelin figure formation, margination of chromatin, and sharp angulation in nuclear contour. Large numbers of macrophages are present. Epithelial-reticular cells which envelop small cortical blood vessels are often retracted, {{with the result}} that the most peripheral layer in the thymic-blood barrier suffers abnormally large gaps. Lymphocytes of the periarterial lymphatic sheaths of spleen and of the cortex of lymph nodes are reduced in number and damaged. Vast numbers of plasma cells and many lymphocytes are evident throughout lymph nodes, in the periarterial lymphatic sheaths, and in the marginal zone and red pulp of the spleen. Plasma cells are of different sizes, the larger having dilated sacs of endoplasmic reticulum. Lymphocytes are small to medium in size. They contain, in varying quantity, ribosomes and smooth membrane-bounded cytoplasmic vesicles approximately 350 to 500 A in diameter. Most plasma cells and lymphocytes are damaged and many of these are phagocytized. Many lymphocytes in lymph nodes, however, show no evidence of damage. Reticular cells and other fixed cells of the connective tissues seldom appear affected. Thus, the major cell types reacting in <b>runt</b> <b>disease</b> are lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes or macrophages.

40|$|Tolerance, {{as defined}} by an {{inability}} to produce <b>runt</b> <b>disease</b> {{and the failure to}} elicit a normal lymphocyte transfer reaction, was induced in Lewis and Brown Norway rats by the neonatal injection of bone marrow from the opposite strain. When thymus, thoracic duct lymph, or lymph node cells from such tolerant Lewis and Brown Norway rats were cultured together, or were individually cultured with similar cells from an F 1 hybrid of these strains, transformation was suppressed to the levels observed in nonmixed control cultures. In contrast, mixtures of cells involving nontolerant donors demonstrated significant transformation as measured by per cent enlarged cells and thymidine- 3 H uptake. The specificity of the tolerance was confirmed by the presence of transformed cells in mixtures involving cells from a tolerant donor and an unrelated or a partially related third strain of rats. From these results, it is suggested that the mixed lymphocyte reaction may be used as a simple test for tolerance and that it most likely represents an in vitro immune response...|$|E
40|$|It is well {{established}} that the syndrome known as "runt disease", "homologous disease", or "secondary disease " can be produced {{by the introduction of}} immunologicaily competent lymphoid ceils into allogeneic (homologous) individuals incapable of rejecting the donor cells. This syndrome has been produced in newborn mice (1), in adult mice previously made tolerant of the injected lymphoid ceils (2), in adult mice pretreated with lethal doses of x-irradiation (3), and in F 1 hybrid mice injected with parental strain lymphoid cells (4). These diverse experimental preparations have three characteristics in common: (a) the injected donor cells are immunologically competent; (b) the recipient animal is unable to reject the donor cells; and (c) the donor cells are injected into a recipient which differs at strong histocompafibillty loci from the donor.

40|$|Using rats of the Lewis and BN (Ag-B locus incompatible) {{isogenic}} strains, {{a comparative}} {{study has been}} made of the capacity to prevent or mitigate the development of <b>runt</b> <b>disease</b> with: (a) lymph node cell suspensions from normal adult BN rats, (b) node cells, or (c) serum from donors sensitized against Lewis tissue antigens, or (d) heterologous anti-lymphocyte serum (ALS) raised in rabbits against rat thymocytes. Following a standard intravenous or intraperitoneal inoculation of 20 x 106 Lewis node cells into neonatal BN hosts, there are cutaneous manifestations of <b>runt</b> <b>disease</b> within 11 – 15 days and death invariably takes place within 20 days. However, complete protection is afforded by administration of a similar number of normal BN node cells via a different vein, or admixed with the otherwise harmful Lewis node cells. However, timing of the administration was crucially important—precedence or delay by as little as 4 hr resulted in a great impairment of protection. When the inoculations of the two cell suspensions were separated by 24 hr, no protection was afforded. These and other observations suggested that a necessary condition for protection of the hosts by unsensitized isologous cells requires that they establish a prompt and intimate confrontation with the homologous target cells. At the same dosage level, suspensions of node cells from sensitized isologous donors were much more effective therapeutically, saving the lives of 92 % of treated subjects when administered after a delay of 3 days, and of 19 % when the delay was 4 or 5 days. Of the various immunotherapeutic agents studied, daily injections of 0. 2 ml of isoantiserum gave the best results, and could totally reverse the course of the disease even when initiated at age 10 – 13 days and subjects already presented symptoms. ALS, although inferior to isoantiserum at the dosage levels tested, proved to be superior to sensitized isologous cells as a protective agent, since the initiation of daily injections after delays of 6 or 8 days were still effective. The observations that delayed treatments of infant rats with isoantisera or ALS resulted in complete recoveries sustain the thesis that the lesions responsible for the fatal outcome of runt diseases are not inflicted at a very early stage. The efficacy of both isoantisera and ALS as a means of inhibiting the progression of homologous disease also suggests that they may have therapeutic value in situations where this condition is encountered...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of {{experiments}} designed to study tolerance, Billingham and Brent observed {{the development of a}} disease 1 to 2 weeks following the injection of immunologically competent homologous lymphoid cells into newborn mice (1).

The clinical and histologic pictures, and the overwhelming evidence that <b>runt</b> <b>disease</b> represents an immunologic attack by the grafted cells on the host have been considered in detail in several recent comprehensive reviews (7 - 9). In the adult animal it has been possible to produce a graft versus host reaction only after immunologic manipulations which permit survival of the transplanted lymphoid cells. This has been achieved by injection of parent strain cells into an F 1 hybrid recipient (10 - 14), by irradiation of the recipient (15 - 17), and by parabiotic union which permits a prolonged exchange of cells (18).

40|$|In 1953, Medawar and {{his colleagues}} (1) induced tissue {{transplantation}} tolerance in mice by injecting allogeneic bone marrow cells intravenously into newborn recipients. Permanent chimerism was established without <b>runt</b> <b>disease.</b> Recipients accepted donor skin grafts but rejected third-party grafts (2). These experimental results were predicted by Burnet and Fenner (3). Although chimerism can be established by injecting allogeneic bone marrow into lethally irradiated adult mice, a lethal graft vs. host disease ensues in most strains of mice (4). Even in those strains in which minimal graft vs. host disease is observed, late deaths (> 100 days after transplantation) occur in a high proportion (up to 40 %) of recipients (5). Recently, stable chimerism and specific tolerance have been induced in adult mice and rats by lethal whole body irradiation of recipients followed by the intravenous infusion of allogeneic fetal liver cells (6) or adult bone marrow cells treated in vitro to remove thymus-derived (T) cells and/or T-cell precursors (7, 8).

40|$|It has {{recently}} been established that the thymus plays {{a fundamental role in}} developmental immunobiology (1 - 3), a role that is most important in early life, before birth and immediately thereafter, but continues into adult life (4). Mice thymectomized immediately after birth are extremely defective in rejecting allogeneic skin or tumor grafts (2, 4, 5) and even xenogeneic skin (6). Their responsive antibody formation is also greatly impaired (6 - 8), although not necessarily for all antigens (8). These animals often develop a wasting syndrome, with failure of body growth and early mortality (6, 8 - 10), and are extremely susceptible to the <b>runt</b> <b>disease</b> produced by administration of aUogeneic lymphoid cells (9 - 11). Furthermore, the lymphoreticular cells derived from neonatally thymectomized mice are defective with respect to their capacity to elicit graft versus host reactions (12, 13). These animals also have a low level of circulating lymphocytes, a depletion of lymphocytes in the tissues, and, to a somewhat lesser degree, a depletion of plasma cells (2, 6, 8 - 11, 13).

40|$|The {{reaction}} between immunologically reactive {{cells and}} a sensitizing antigen {{has been studied}} in several different contexts. The direct action of antigen with cells actually or potentially capable of producing antibody may under some circumstances lead to growth stimulation (1) or under different conditions to death of the cells and curtailment of antibody production (2). Both macrophages (3) and lymphoid cells (4) {{have been found to}} be damaged by exposure to the sensitizing antigen. Gofer and Boyse have suggested that spleen cells from C 57 BL mice immunized against A strain antigens may be destroyed by "allergic death " following injection into their respective F 1 hybrids (2). Recently it was found that the capacity of C 57 BL spleen cells to induce <b>runt</b> <b>disease</b> in newborn Swiss mice was reduced if the spleen donors were previously immunized with antigens from the prospective recipients. This was attributed to the deleterious effect on the allogeneic spleen cells resulting from exposure to the antigens of the host and from the immune response of the host (5).

40|$|A {{previous}} {{report that the}} offspring of outbred Sprague-Dawley rats, born of mothers presensitized or tolerant with respect to tissue antigens of the Lewis strain, and reinoculated with Lewis cells during their pregnancy, reject test grafts of Lewis skin in an accelerated manner has been confirmed. This "maternally induced" alteration in reactivity of the progeny {{has been found to}} be long lasting, immunologically specific, and probably not due to transfer of humoral antibody. It has been established that the reexposure of the mothers to donor cellular antigen during pregnancy augmented the influence of the prior states of tolerance or sensitivity. To obviate the complications inherent in working with the outbred Sprague-Dawley rats, the key experiments summarized above were repeated with isogenic Fischer rats as parents and Lewis rats as the tissue donors as before. With this combination it was found that a state of prior sensitization or tolerance in the mothers resulted in the apparent induction of tolerance in some of their progeny. Reinoculation of either the tolerant or sensitized mothers during pregnancy slightly increased the incidence and degree of impairment of their offsprings' capacity to reject Lewis skin grafts. A single intraperitoneal injection of 100 x 106 million Lewis lymphoid cells into normal Fischer rats in the 14 th– 16 th day of pregnancy also weakened the reactivity of their progeny to Lewis test grafts. Further to test the premise that this weakened reactivity might be due to maternal induction of tolerance, by antenatal transmission of alien cells, the lymphohematopoietic tissue system of adult Fischer females was replaced by that from Lewis donors with the aid of cyclophosphamide. It was anticipated that when these animals were mated with Fischer males, sufficient Lewis leukocytes might cross the placentas to induce high degrees of tolerance. Although normal sized healthy litters were born, about 50 % of the infants succumbed to graft-versus-host (GVH) or <b>runt</b> <b>disease</b> within 40 days, many of them giving evidence of being tolerant of Lewis grafts. The mothers, too, developed chronic GVH disease. The offspring of Fischer females made chimeric with cells from (Fischer x Lewis) F 1 hybrid donors, as well as their mothers, remained healthy. Intraperitoneal injection of normal Fischer females, in the 15 th– 17 th day of pregnancy, with 100 million lymphoid cells from specifically sensitized Lewis rats, also caused fatal <b>runt</b> <b>disease</b> to develop in about 50 % of their offspring, but left the mothers unscathed. Taken together, these various findings indicate that in some genetic contexts at least the extent of the natural surreptitious transplacental cellular traffic can be considerably augmented experimentally, though how this comes about and why lymphocytic cells that are foreign to the mother can apparently gain access to fetuses more readily than her own cells remain to be determined...|$|E
40|$|Erythropoietic {{cells of}} two {{unrelated}} strains, C 3 H (or C 3 Hf) and C 57 BL/ 6, can coexist throughout hematopoiesis in allophenic mice experimentally produced from aggregated, undifferentiated blastomeres of separate genotypes. The presence of two red cell genotypes {{in these circumstances}} signifies that the erythroid population must normally be multiclonal, i. e., derived mitotically from at least two genetically determined cells. The two strains were detected by hemagglutination and absorption tests of erythrocytes for the specific histocompatibility antigens dictated by the H- 2 k and H- 2 b alleles. Of 34 C 3 H(f) ↔ C 57 BL/ 6 allophenics tested, 16 had both red cell types; the remaining 18 showed only C 3 H or C 57 red cells and included 12 mice with both cell strains present in some other tissues. All animals with evidence of two H- 2 phenotypes among circulating erythrocytes were permanently immunologically tolerant of both antigenic types and remained free of <b>runt</b> <b>disease.</b> They lived a full lifespan, up to 2 yr 7 ½ months of age. The data suggest a possible specific selective advantage of C 57 BL/ 6 over C 3 H erythropoietic tissue. There is considerable individual variability, not only in proportions of antigenically distinct erythrocytes, but also in strain composition of other tissues in the same animals. A broad spectrum of distinctive situations is found, in which parameters are varied within or outside of the circulatory system. Allophenic mice can therefore serve as investigative tools for entirely new kinds of experimental studies of gene control mechanisms and blood physiology in normal hematopoiesis and {{in a number of}} hereditary blood diseases...|$|E
40|$|Immunological {{tolerance}} of tissue homografts can be induced in rats {{if they are}} injected with living cells from the prospective donors during the neonatal period (1 - 3). When the cell suspension used to bring about tolerance contains {{a high percentage of}} immunologically competent cells, many of the treated animals, after an initial period of apparently normal growth, become ill, fail to grow at a normal rate, and soon die (3 - 5). This syndrome, first described in mice, was christened "runt disease " by Billingham and Brent (6). Recently {{it has been shown that}} <b>runt</b> <b>disease</b> can be induced in rats by an injection of cells from thoracic duct lymph (7, 8). Since about 95 per cent of the cells in such lymph are typical small lymphocytes considered to be incapable of division, and the other 5 per cent are medium and large lymphocytes known to divide in culture (9), it has been generally assumed that the large lymphocytes are the immunologically active cells in the inoculum responsible for any ensuing illness (7). In this paper evidence is presented which suggests that in fact the large lymphocytes are relatively inactive in this situation and that it is the small lymphocytes which initiate the reaction against the host. Materials and Methods Rats. [...] The rats used belong to laboratory sublines of two isogenic strains originating at the Agricultural Research Council, Compton, Berkshire, England: albino A and black-hoo'ded B.

40|$|In rabbits, {{complete}} thymectomy {{before the}} age of 5 days produced immunologic deficiency in the adult animals, as indicated by reduced antibody production to bovine serum albumin and bacteriophage T 2. Homotransplantation immunity was unaffected, however. In an inbred strain of mice, complete neonatal thymectomy resulted in complete inability of the 60 -day-old animals to form antibody to bacteriophage T 2. Inbred mice, completely thymectomized at birth, had a deficient homograft response, indicated by acceptance of skin homografts from strains differing in both the weaker and stronger (H- 2) histocompatibility antigens. Tumor transplants (mammary adenocarcinoma) were also successful across the H- 2 genetic barrier in mice thymectomized at birth. Neonatal thymectomy also eliminated the Eichwald-Silmser phenomenon, rendering female mice capable of accepting isografts of male skin. Transplantation immunity in mice was also affected by later thymectomy, at 30 days of age, in certain strain combinations involving weak histocompatibility differences. Spleen and lymph node cells from mice thymectomized at birth or at 6 days of age, and sacrificed 2 months later, did not produce a graft versus host reaction in appropriate F 1 hybrid recipients, indicating that such cells are immunologically inactive. Neonatal thymectomy of F 1 hybrid mice, and in one strain combination thymectomy at 40 days of age, produced animals with inordinate susceptibility to <b>runt</b> <b>disease</b> (homologous disease) following injection of parent strain spleen cells 35 days (neonatal surgery) and 10 days (surgery at 40 days) later. Mice thymectomized at birth also showed growth failure and were short-lived. Studies of newborn mice indicated that they have true lymphocytes only in the thymus, and lack such cells in the spleen, lymph nodes, and gut. In normal mice, adult lymphoid structure develops gradually, beginning during the 1 st week of life and continuing for the next month. In contrast, mice thymectomized at birth do not develop mature lymphoid structure: the lymph nodes and spleens tend to be small and poorly organized, and show a quantitative deficiency in lymphoid cells. It is our current working hypothesis that the thymus makes a major contribution toward the centrifugal distribution of lymphoid cells which, in turn, is essential to the full expression of immunologic capacity...|$|E
