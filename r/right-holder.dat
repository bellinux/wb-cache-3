5000|$|Some {{philosophers}} and political scientists {{make a distinction}} between claim rights and liberty rights. A claim right is a right which entails responsibilities, duties, or obligations on other parties regarding the <b>right-holder.</b> In contrast, a liberty right is a right which does not entail obligations on other parties, but rather only freedom or permission for the <b>right-holder.</b> The distinction between these two senses of [...] "rights" [...] originates in American jurist Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld's analysis thereof in his seminal work Fundamental Legal Conceptions, As Applied in Judicial Reasoning and Other Legal Essays.|$|E

5000|$|A liberty {{right or}} privilege, in contrast, {{is simply a}} freedom or {{permission}} for the <b>right-holder</b> to do something, {{and there are no}} obligations on other parties to do or not do anything.

[...] For example, if a person has a legal liberty right to free speech, that merely means that it is not legally forbidden for them to speak freely: {{it does not mean that}} anyone has to help enable their speech, or to listen to their speech; or even, per se, refrain from stopping them from speaking, though other rights, such as the claim right to be free from assault, may severely limit what others can do to stop them.|$|E

5000|$|A claim {{right is}} a right which entails that another person {{has a duty to}} the <b>right-holder.</b> Somebody else must do or refrain from doing {{something}} to or for the claim holder, such as perform a service or supply a product for him or her; that is, he or she has a claim to that service or product (another term is thing in action). In logic, this idea can be expressed as: [...] "Person A has a claim that person B do something if and only if B has a duty to A to do that something." [...] Every claim-right entails that some other duty-bearer must do some duty for the claim to be satisfied. This duty can be to act or to refrain from acting. For example, many jurisdictions recognize broad claim rights to things like [...] "life, liberty, and property"; these rights impose an obligation upon others not to assault or restrain a person, or use their property, without the claim-holder's permission. Likewise, in jurisdictions where social welfare services are provided, citizens have legal claim rights to be provided with those services.|$|E

"The New Renaissance", {{the report}} of the Comité des Sages Reflection Group on Bringing Europe’s Cultural Heritage Online, {{published}} on 10 January 2011, stated that the public sector had a duty to digitize their cultural heritage. Under the heading of [...] "Ensuring wide access to and use of digitised public domain material" [...] the report stated:The Copyright Term Directive of 2006 was intended to address the second concern, but has not been effective in harmonizing the terms and definitions.It does state that the term of protection for works whose <b>right-holder</b> is a legal person, as well as for collective works, is 70 years after the work is made available to the public.It also states that where [...] "the natural persons who have created the collective work are identified as such in the versions of the works which are made available to the public" [...] the duration of protection is 70 years after the death of the last surviving author.However, there is no standard European definition of the terms [...] "works of joint authorship" [...] and [...] "collective works", so each country must define laws and make legal decisions over when a work with multiple authors is a work of joint authorship, collective work or simply a collection of separate works.|$|E
5000|$|The {{inclusion}} of defense of one's family and home recognizes the universal benefit claimed {{to stem from}} the family's peaceable possession of private property. This general approach implicitly attacks Hohfeld's focus on the correlative relationship between right and duty as an aspect of human interactiveness as opposed to rights deemed implicitly more important because they attach to a person {{by virtue of his}} or her ownership of property. Further, it follows that, in this moral balancing exercise, laws must simultaneously criminalize aggression resulting in loss or injury, but decriminalize qualitatively identical violence causing loss or injury because it is used in self-defense. As a resolution of this apparent paradox and in defiance of Hohfeld, Robert Nozick asserted that there are no positive civil rights, only rights to property and the right of autonomy. In this theory, the [...] "acquisition principle" [...] states that people are entitled to defend and retain all holdings acquired in a just way and the [...] "rectification principle" [...] requires that any violation of the first principle be repaired by returning holdings to their rightful owners as a [...] "one time" [...] redistribution. Hence, in default of self-defense in the first instance, any damage to property must be made good either in kind or by value. Similarly, theorists such as George Fletcher and Robert Schopp have adopted European concepts of autonomy in their liberal theories to justify the <b>right-holder</b> using all necessary force to defend his or her autonomy and rights. This right inverts the felicitation principle of utilitarianism with the responsive violence being the greatest good to the individual, but accurately mirrors Jeremy Bentham who saw property as the driving force to enable individuals to enhance their utilities through stable investment and trade. In liberal theory, therefore, to maximise the utility, {{there is no need to}} retreat nor use only proportionate force. The attacker is said to sacrifice legal protection when initiating the attack. In this respect, the criminal law is not the tool of a welfare state which offers a safety net for all when they are injured. Nevertheless, some limits must be recognized as where a minor initial attack simply becomes a pretext for an excessively violent response. The civil law systems have a theory of [...] "abuse of right" [...] to explain denial of justification in such extreme cases.|$|E

40|$|A Human Rights-Based Approach (HRBA) to {{development}} has been adopted by numerous international NGOs, multilateral and bilateral agencies. In theory, the HRBA {{has the potential to}} dislodge inequalities and discrimination that perpetuate poverty. However, the implementation of the HRBA at the local level has been a challenge. This thesis is an examination of how the HRBA is operationalized at the local level by international NGOs and its actual impact on women s empowerment. In order to achieve this, a case of ActionAid s intervention on women s rights in Malawi s Rumphi district, was studied. Contrary to what an HRBA assumes, the study indicates a top-down approach during the implementation of the project. This shows that the HRBA as applied by AAM did not lead to a radical transformation of power relations among development actors namely: the donor, AAM staff, the RWF and the <b>right-holders.</b> This in turn limited the desired empowerment outcomes among the <b>right-holders.</b> The study established that there are many challenges that affect the implementation of the HRBA. These include low education levels among the <b>right-holders,</b> high poverty levels and lack of financial resources to implement a holistic approach. The study further indicates that the HRBA aided in filling the knowledge gap among women on various developmental issues. However, the study confirmed that such intangible benefits do not address the immediate needs of the <b>right-holders.</b> The study suggests that for effective poverty reduction, development actors must consider blending the HRBA with other approaches in order to address the immediate needs of the <b>right-holders...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{rights of}} first refusal and rights of first offer in a multiple-buyer, sequential bargaining setting. A {{right of first refusal}} entitles the <b>right-holder</b> {{to purchase a}} subject asset on the same terms as those accepted by a third party. A right of first offer requires a seller to first offer the <b>right-holder</b> to buy a subject asset and prohibits the seller from subsequently selling the asset to a third party on better terms than those offered to the <b>right-holder.</b> We examine when and how such rights yield benefits to or impose costs on the <b>right-holder</b> and the seller. We show that a right of first refusal transfers value from other buyers to the <b>right-holder,</b> but may also force the seller to make suboptimal offers. A right of first offer induces the seller to lower his first-period offer, which will tend to increase the net surplus to the seller and <b>right-holder,</b> but also forces the seller to make suboptimal subsequent offers. We find conditions under which it is in the ex ante interest of the seller and the <b>right-holder</b> to contract for a right of first refusal or a right of first offer, respectively...|$|E
40|$|When {{a seller}} encumbers a {{property}} with {{a right of}} first refusal, whenever a third party offers to purchase the property, the <b>right-holder</b> can acquire the property by simply matching the third party's offer. I model the right as a modified auction where the <b>right-holder</b> gets to observe the third party's bid before making his own. I show that, compared to the standard auctions, the right increases the joint profit of the seller and the <b>right-holder</b> by reducing the third party's profit. This result is independent of whether the third party {{is aware of the}} right's existence and whether the right creates a welfare loss. Copyright 2009 The Authors.

40|$|The {{controversy}} {{regarding the}} appropriate purpose of tort law continues to rage. Some advocate that tort rules should minimize accident costs {{as an instrument}} for maximizing social welfare and wealth. Others argue that tort rules should fairly protect the individual right to physical security. Although these two conceptions of tort law are fundamentally incompatible, it is a separate question whether the requirements of welfare economics can be satisfied by rights-based tort rules. This article identifies a class of rights-based tort rules that conforms to existing tort practice and satisfies the distributional requirements of welfare economics. These fair tort rules protect the individual right to physical security for reasons of individual autonomy, a justification that rules out the maximization of social welfare {{as a reason for}} compromising the right-holder’s autonomy. The tort right, however, does not constrain social welfare in all possible states of the world. The right only protects the autonomy of the <b>right-holder</b> and does not bar the <b>right-holder</b> from exercising her autonomy. The <b>right-holder</b> can exercise her autonomy to promote her welfare, eliminating any conflict between the tort right and the Pareto principle. In addition to being consistent with the Pareto principle, this class of rights-based tort rules satisfies the equity-efficiency criterion. These rights-based tort rules therefore satisfy the two requirements of welfare economics that are relevant for evaluating distributional rules. The substantive compatibility of rights-based tort rules and welfare economics is further confirmed by analyses showing that any rights-based tort system is likely to provide an important role for economic analysis, one that operates within the constrained space of individual welfare. As a distributional matter, there is no conflict between efficiency and fairness in tort law...|$|E

40|$|The {{paper offers}} {{analysis}} of a right to existential use of water resources (public waterways and water recipients) by owners of agricultural law located immediately next to these types of water resources. This right covers the right to drinkable water, livestock drinking water and basic irrigation without a use of special irrigation equipment. The <b>right-holder</b> of the listed types {{of the use of}} water resources is different from the <b>right-holder</b> of the general use of water resources. In the earlier case the <b>right-holder</b> is the owner of the riparian agricultural land. The holder of the general right of use may be any person, under equal terms, regardless of whether he owns agricultural or other type of land next to the waterway. The right of the riparian land owners differs from the general right of use because they enjoy priority over the right of use by other persons holding general rights of use over waterways. The water rights of riparian land owners overlaps with the general right of use in that it covers the use of water for existential needs. The rights of the riparian land owner are different from the so called special or commercial use of water resources (use of water and water power for commercial purposes, such as production of electrical power, etc.). The difference is that the rights of the riparian land owners is derived directly from the law, without the need for any action by the state organs (water resource permits) and is free of charge. On the other hand, the right to commercial use of public water resources is always based on water use permits or approvals and concession agreements and is associated with a fee payable to the owners of the public water resource...|$|E
