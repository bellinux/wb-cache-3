New genres have been studied for their rhetorical effectiveness, like sermons, letters, and, more recently, non-verbal genres like political cartoons, film, and public monuments. Further contemporary genre criticism has revised our understanding of genre in several ways.

The ’am ha-aretz, people accused of non-compliance with ritual purity, are also a focus of the paper.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade several metrics that reflect the {{variability}} of vocalic and consonantal intervals in speech {{have been used to}} quantify the impressionistic division of languages into stress- and syllable-timed. Although all such metrics successfully separate prototypical languages, such as stress-timed English and syllable-timed Spanish, their results for other languages are less clear. The problem is related to the limited datasets used, which consist of either a small number of sentences per language elicited from several speakers, or longer stretches of speech elicited from one speaker per language. Here we elicited short sentences, story reading and spontaneous speech from several speakers of stress-timed English, syllable-timed Spanish, Korean, a hitherto unclassified language, and Greek, which has shown to <b>resist</b> <b>classification.</b> Our results show that different metrics yield different classifications for some languages, like Greek, while scores for the same language differ depending on speaking style. Taken all together these results cast doubt on the robustness and usefulness of the popular metrics and suggest that alternative ways of conceiving of speech rhythm that do not rely exclusively on timing but take relative prominence into account may ultimately be more successful in explaining speech rhythm...|$|E

In analogy with pseudogenes, we define pseudo-messenger RNA to be RNA molecules that resemble protein- coding mRNA, but cannot encode full-length proteins owing to disruptions {{of the reading}} frame. Using a rigorous computational pipeline, which rules out sequencing errors, we identify 10, 679 pseudo - messenger RNAs (approximately half of which are transposonassociated) among the 102, 801 FANTOM 3 mouse cDNAs: just over 10 % of the FANTOM 3 transcriptome.

In summary, we survey a large class of non- standard but potentially functional transcripts that are likely to encode genetic information and effect biological processes in novel ways.

Utilizing examples from an online ethnographic observation of eighteen 12 - 13 year old girls in Christchurch, New Zealand, I discuss how these girls constituted online subject positions through co-constructive relationships with friends.

40|$|Identity is an {{ambiguous}} concept, {{yet it is}} central to virtually every sphere of human interaction. "Who" one is, claims to be, or is designated as delineating a horizon of possibility. The question "who?" is a riddle. On the one hand, the answer is defined by where one fits into the world. On the other hand, there is an almost inalienable presence of one's self/soul to oneself that seems to <b>resist</b> <b>classification</b> with respect to world structures. The point of intersection between {{the world and the}} soul is a ground of ambiguity upon which the story of a life is told, performed, observed, produced and sold. This work riddles with Ricoeur, Merleau-Ponty, and Hannah Arendt in order to articulate and delineate identity {{in such a way as}} to be faithful to both worldly conditions and the fears and aspirations of the soul. Insofar as one's identity is knowable, it is knowable as a narrative. Ricoeur's contribution to narrative identity is his assertion that human existence is fundamentally temporal. Consequently, the circle of action and narrative is central to the question of identity. Novel narrative forms are emerging from technological advances. For example, computer games have developed into a multi-billion dollar endeavor. Just as fiction and history imitate action and in turn inspire action, so too do digital narratives. This thesis explores the ways in which identity is articulated and ascribed by emerging digital narrative forms...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the pillars}} of my {{dissertation}} is the tenet that the material form that conveys a text to its readers or audience mediates the production of meaning. My dissertation {{is based upon the}} proposition that many Spanish and Latin American novels of the 20 th century are questioning, through their internal structures and forms, the book as a compact object, as unique container of texts. In many ways these novels are questioning the book and its form as appropriate material support to express the meaning that the writer intended. Publishing houses demand that texts such as archives, letters, manuscripts, reports of any kind, notebooks, scripts, booklets, diaries, images, quotes, codices, handwritten notes, etc. be shaped in a traditional book form. In order to publish, writers have sometimes to conform unwillingly to the rules of the market and to pressure by publishers. I research the implications of these texts as they apply to reader reception and the meanings suggested in the form of these textual materials. My research is of significance because to this date there have been few studies undertaken on how current Spanish and Latin American writers handle textual materials in order to produce meaning for the reader. I propose that {{in the same way that}} a writer chooses a narrative voice, a time, a space, or characters to develop the text, he or she also has to choose a form, and this textual form has meaning in itself. In order to show that preoccupation with textual form is a wide phenomenon, my research focuses on five novels of different writers and countries. Still, it must be taken into consideration that they represent just a small sample of texts in which the problem of textual materials and their meaning is significant. These novels are Manuel Puig 2 ̆ 7 s Heartbreak Tango, a Serial (Boquitas pintadas, Folletín 1968), Clarice Lispector 2 ̆ 7 s Stream of Life (Água viva. Ficção, 1973), Ignácio de Loyola Brandão 2 ̆ 7 s Zero (1975) and Carmen Martín Gaite 2 ̆ 7 s Variable Cloud (Nubosidad variable, 1992). The aforementioned novels <b>resist</b> <b>classification</b> as books; rather, they could be considered 2 ̆ 2 non-book texts 2 ̆ 2 since not all texts are necessarily given in traditional book form. I propose the use of terms such as 2 ̆ 2 novel of documents 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 material infraestructure 2 ̆ 2 to describe those works built or composed by 2 ̆ 2 unrelated 2 ̆ 2 texts that the reader must combine in order to give them a common meaning and create his/her own fiction. Since the reader is dealing with textual materials, his/her role in these novels is active and of great importance because s/he needs to connect the threads among the different texts. Here lies the essential relation between material forms of writing and reading. So, from now on, when we read the question that brings up is whether we are reading books that hide other textual formats: 2 ̆ 2 books which are not books 2 ̆ 2. ...|$|E

This paper examines the movement from a political ecology perspective and focuses on violence arising from natural resource-related grievances, notably land alienation, forest policy and employment from Jharkhand’s mines. Drawing from political ecology’s emphasis {{on the need to}} examine conflict from a range of different spatial scales, the paper emphasises the impor-tance of a micro-political ecology approach for understanding how locally based conflicts over natural resources can harden into more established grievances that can be mobilised politically as part of a wider and potentially violent protest movement. It is also suggested that micro-political ecology approaches can assist participatory resource management initiatives in ameliorating local conflicts over access to resources, thus helping to prevent them from escalating into more wide-spread violence...|$|R

Obeying the law of corsi e ricorsi, there was a certain return in the 80 s to simpler expression which, however, does not pretend to be that of the "man on the street" reflecting the historical circumstance, but rather a search for essences, for eternal values. Each poet—M. V. Atencia, Jesus Munarriz, and Luis Suñen can serve as examples of the "essential" inclination—traces his own way and creates a personal poetics. Faith in the word is their common denominator.

40|$|Hume {{developed}} an original and revolutionary theoretical paradigm for explaining the spontaneous {{emergence of the}} classic conventions of justice - stable possession, transference of property by consent, and the obligation to fulfill promises. In a scenario of scarce external resources, Hume's central {{idea is that the}} development of the rules of justice responds to a sense of common interest that progressively tames the destructiveness of natural self-love and expands the action of natural moral sentiments. By handling conceptual tools that anticipated game theory for centuries, Hume was able to break with rationalism, the natural law school, and Hobbes's contractarianism. Unlike natural moral sentiments, the sense of justice is valuable and reaches full strength within a general plan or system of actions. However, unlike game theory, Hume does not assume that people have transparent access to the their own motivations and the inner structure of the social world. In contrast, he blends ideas such as cognitive delusion, learning by experience and coordination to construct a theory that still deserves careful discussion, even though it <b>resists</b> <b>classification</b> under contemporary headings...|$|R

These are the very features that Oakeshott highlights in his lectures on the ‘Political Experience’ and ‘Political Thought’ of the Romans. Oakeshott values the distinction that the Romans, but not the Greeks, made between public and private, but unlike later republicans he does not associate the public sphere exclusively with political participation and civic virtues. One may contribute just as significantly to the public concern by being a music-hall entertainer. Oakeshott is clearly differentiated from modern instrumental republicans who in his view would be rationalists obsessed with institutional design and with viewing the civil condition as an enterprise association...|$|R

The results suggest that rhythmic scores can be severely affected by the choice of materials, especially in languages such as Italian, in which it is easy to avoid or accentuate variability (e. g., by excluding or including geminates).
