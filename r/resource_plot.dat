40|$|Carnivore (top-down) and {{resource}} (bottom-up) influences in food webs are strong and pervasive, but {{few studies have}} investigated their interactive effects in species-rich terrestrial ecosystems. This study focused on arthropods associated with the dominant tree species, Metrosideros polymorpha (Myrtaceae), in Hawaiian forests. Severe soil nutrient limitation on a 120 -yr-old lava flow was removed by fertilization and combined with bird predator exclusion cages in a randomized block design. Arthropod densities were measured from clipped foliage at the outset and conclusion of a 33 -mo experiment, and their biomass was estimated using regression equations. Metrosideros foliar nitrogen, tree growth, and biomass increased directly in response to fertilization but did not change with bird exclusion. Fertilization increased detritivore densities but not biomass, and both density and biomass of herbivores, while bird exclusion increased both density and biomass of carnivores. Fertilization also increased spider density and biomass, but bird exclusion increased spider numbers (15 species) only in high <b>resource</b> <b>plots.</b> Overall, trophic level biomass responses were less pronounced than density because smaller bodied individuals responded more to enrichment. Bottom-up factors controlled basal trophic levels, and detritivores comprised the largest fraction of arthropod density and biomass.

40|$|We {{hypothesised}} that (i) increased feeding motivation {{will cause}} sheep to move further apart {{as a result}} of individuals trying to find food and (ii) in conditions of high food availability, sheep will move less and show greater social attraction. The effects of both feeding motivation and food availability on spatial distribution was examined in eight groups of food-deprived (high feeding motivation) and satiated (low feeding motivation) sheep in good or poor food <b>resource</b> <b>plots</b> in a 232 design. Distance travelled was assessed using Global Positioning System collars, grazing time using scan sampling and social cohesion using proximity collars that record the number and duration of encounters within 4 m. Food-deprived sheep in the good-resource plots grazed the most, whereas satiated sheep in the poor-resource plots grazed the least (P 50. 004). Food deprivation had no significant effect on the number or duration of encounters and feeding motivation appeared to have little effect on spatial distribution. Contrary to expectation, sheep had more encounters (P 50. 04) of a longer total duration (P 50. 02) in poor-resource plots than in good-resource plots, indicating that sheep were showing more social cohesion if food was scarce. Our findings suggest that when food is scarce, animals may come together in an attempt to share information on food availability. However, when a highly preferred food is abundant and well dispersed, they may move apart in order to maximise the intake. It is concluded that the particular details of our experiment, namely the even distribution or absence of a highly preferred food, affected spatial distribution patterns as sheep tried to find this food and maximise the intake...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT—Charniodiscus is a leaf-shaped Ediacaran (terminal Neoproterozoic) fossil with a {{worldwide}} distribution, but {{the scarcity of}} complete specimens has previously hindered evaluation of its taxonomy and ecology. The presence of hundreds of complete (fronds with stem and disc attached) Charniodiscus specimens from the Avalon Zone of Newfoundland has allowed for detailed morphometric analysis of Charniodiscus specimens and permits determination of characteristics which vary with growth (e. g., stem length, frond width, and disc diameter) versus those that reflect taxonomic differences (e. g., number of primary segments, presence of a distal spine, shape ratios). This {{has led to the}} recognition of three species of Charniodiscus in the Mistaken Point biota, including numerous specimens of two new taxa, C. procerus n. sp. and C. spinosus n. sp., and rare specimens of the Australian species C. arboreus.

Additionally, our approach can also be used for other ecosystem compositions: multiple resources-multiple species communities with equilibrium or oscillatory dynamics.

Three hypotheses have been presented: imperfect markets, soil characteristics, and measurement error. This thesis focuses on soil quality and imperfect markets as the cause of the relationship: smaller plots are simply more fertile and thus more productive than larger, more marginal lands. Since soil characteristics have not been considered in previous analyses, the resulting omitted variable bias induces the inverse relationship. The soil hypothesis is tested within the context of imperfect markets, including various types of labor and household or village fixed effects. Using soil and labor data from Madagascar, this thesis finds that soil characteristics do not influence the inverse relationship The inverse relationship remains even after controlling for house-hold level effects questioning imperfect markets as a cause.

The upscaling of such arrangements requires an understanding of why they emerge, how they function and how they are sustained. This paper presents a case study of local level water institutions in Bangalala village in the Makanya catchment, Tanzania. Unlike most research on collective action in which water asymmetry, inequality and heterogeneity are seen as risks to collective action, this study looked at how they dynamically interact and give rise to interdependencies between water users which facilitate coordination and collective action. The findings are confined to relatively small spatial and social scales, involving irrigators from one village. In such situations there may be inhibitions to unilateral action due to social and peer pressure. Spatial or social proximity may thus be a necessary condition for collective action in water asymmetrical situations to emerge. This points to the need for further research, namely to describe and analyse the dynamics engendered by water asymmetry, inequality and heterogeneity at larger spatial scales...|$|R

In savanna systems, Macrotermes termites, through forming spatially explicit mounds with unique woody plant assemblages, emerge as important sources of such heterogeneity. Despite a growing consensus regarding {{the importance of}} functional diversity (FD) to ecosystem processes, no study has quantified how termite mounds affect woody plant FD. We address whether termite mounds alter the distribution of functional traits, and increase FD of woody plant communities within Africa's largest savanna woodland, the 2. 7 million km 2 miombo system. Using plant traits that change according to soil resources (for example, water and nutrients), and disturbance (for example, fire and elephant herbivory), we identified response functional groups and compared relative representation of these groups between mound and matrix habitats. We also asked whether mound and matrix habitats differed in their contribution to FD within the system. Although species representing most functional groups were found in both mound and matrix habitats, relative abundance of functional groups differed between mound and matrix. Mound plant assemblages had greater response diversity to soil <b>resources</b> than matrix <b>plots,</b> {{but there was no}} difference in response diversity to disturbance.

Poly-(lactic acid) (PLA) is an aliphatic polyester {{that can be}} derived from 100 % renewable <b>resources.</b> The load-extension <b>plot</b> of a polylactide fiber seems to be especially compatible with that of wool. Consequently polyester/wool 55 / 45 and polylactide/wool 55 / 45 yarns were spun using the Sirospun process and plain and twill woven fabrics were industrially produced. Washed and heat set fabrics were subjected to a conventional process of dyeing and decatizing. Fabrics were gradually worn by abrasion using a Martindale wear and abrasion tester.; Using the bursting strength test, the viscoelastic behavior of the fabrics when multidirectional extended was simulated and modeled using a modified non-linear Maxwell model. The three steps of fiber decrimping and orientation, fiber stretching and maximum yield and breaking were analyzed. PET/wool fabrics show a more linear behavior than PLA/wool ones and the influence of weave, finishing and wearing on the viscoelastic behavior of PLA/wool fabrics were highly relevant when compared with that on PET/wool ones. It seems that when blended with PET, wool develops its felting effect during finishing and wearing, while when blended with PLA, the felting effect of wool is hardly developed due to the lower resistance of PLA to hydrolysis and its lower thermal stability.

40|$|International audiencePlant {{structural}} {{diversity is}} usually considered as beneficial for ecosystem functioning. For instance, {{numerous studies have}} reported positive species diversity-productivity relationships in plant communities. However, other aspects of structural diversity such as individual size inequality have been far less investigated. In forests, tree size inequality impacts directly tree growth and asymmetric competition, but consequences on forest productivity are still indeterminate. In addition, the effect of tree size inequality on productivity is likely to vary with species shade-tolerance, a key ecological characteristic controlling asymmetric competition and light <b>resource</b> acquisition. Using <b>plot</b> data from the French National Geographic Agency, we studied the response of stand productivity to size inequality for ten forest species differing in shade tolerance. We fitted a basal area stand production model that included abiotic factors, stand density, stand development stage and a tree size inequality index. Then, using a forest dynamics model we explored whether mechanisms of light interception and light use efficiency could explain the tree size inequality effect observed for three of the ten species studied. Size inequality negatively affected basal area increment for seven out of the ten species investigated. However, this effect {{was not related to}} the shade tolerance of these species. According to the model simulations, the negative tree size inequality effect could result both from reduced total stand light interception and reduced light use efficiency. Our results demonstrate that negative relationships between size inequality and productivity may be the rule in tree populations. The lack of effect of shade tolerance indicates compensatory mechanisms between effect on light availability and response to light availability. Such a pattern deserves further investigations for mixed forestswhere complementarity effects between species are involved. When studying the effect of structural diversity on ecosystem productivity, tree size inequality is a major facet that should be taken into account...|$|R

[...] Humboldt State University, 1988 Bird {{community}} {{structure was}} described in an oak woodland near Hopland, Mendocino County, California, between March 1986 and June 1987. The bird community was censused, the vegetative community was measured, and the foraging behavior of 20 insectivorous and/or granivorous bird species was observed on 23 5 ha study <b>plots.</b> <b>Resource</b> partitioning between bird species in the foliage-foraging guild was investigated. Seventy-three bird species were detected during censuses. Thirty-three species were insectivorous and confirmed breeders. Cavity nesters comprised {{a large proportion of}} the breeding bird community in terms of species (24. 5 percent) and individuals (58. 1 percent). Deciduous oak trees dominated most study plots, and blue oak was the most abundant deciduous oak. Floristics, structure, and elevation varied among study plots. The 800 m elevation gradient that existed among study plots was partially responsible for the variance in vegetative characteristics among plots. Three guilds (bark-, ground-, and foliage-foragers) were delineated based on frequency of use of substrates where foraging attempts were directed. The foliage-foraging guild consisted of 10 species. These 10 species were widespread, with an average of 90 percent frequency of occurrence across study plots. Year-round residents (three species) appeared to be more abundant than summer residents (seven species). Resource partitioning between bird species in the foliage-foraging guild occurred on both spatial and behavioral "axes". Spatial overlap was measured by habitat association, plant species use, and location on the plant. Behavioral overlap was measured by substrates and maneuvers used to obtain prey, search movements, and prey type. Spatial and behavioral overlap was extensive among species, but the abundance of each species and the frequency of use of resources and behaviors varied between species. All species differed significantly on one or more resource axes. The influence of residency, body size, and nest type on resource use is discussed...|$|R

In the soldier part of the licentiate stays and in the united two, undoubtedly, very much of Vidriera. On having tried to interpret the formal and plot elements of La ilustre fregona, generally considered hybrids, the fundamental structure of the novel is emphasized between two kinds, the picaresca one and the novela de caballerías. The metamorphosis marks the structure and the sense of the novella. And the reader of Cervantes will have learned, once again, that in this set can glimpse the narrative verisimilitude and an education. Between least studied by the critics who have approached the Novelas ejemplares, Las dos doncellas has suffered alternadamente, especially between the first interpretations, extreme judgments of merit or of scanty value. In the novella the repetition of the <b>plot</b> <b>resources</b> in the duplication of seemingly similar prominent figures, or to offer at least two possible solutions {{to the question of the}} loss of the honor and of the honor, Teodosia's history and Leocadia's history, would have the effect of teaching a narrative process to the reader still in fieri, in which the prominent figures are constructed at the same time they are telling about themselves...|$|R
40|$|Across {{species and}} populations, {{encounters}} between neighboring social groups take {{a variety of}} forms. In particular, intergroup encounters (IGEs) {{may or may not}} be aggressive and may include the participation of males and/or females. The proximate causes of aggressive participation by each sex, particularly among primates, is generally thought to be the availability of mates and food. However, existing hypotheses of resource defense have rarely been explicitly tested through identification of the proximate causes of male and female aggression. In this dissertation, I sought to test the existing hypotheses by determining whether female food defense, male food defense, and male mate defense occur in grey-cheeked mangabeys (Lophocebus albigena) and redtail monkeys (Cercopithecus ascanius). With a team of field assistants, I observed six mangabey groups for 15 months and four redtail groups for 12 months at the Ngogo site in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We observed naturally-occurring IGEs in both species, simulated IGEs among mangabey groups using playback experiments, and measured the availability of food <b>resources</b> in botanical <b>plots.</b> I evaluated multiple aspects of intergroup relations, including initiation of encounters, occurrence of intense aggression, encounter outcomes, overall encounter rates, and the effect of neighbors' long-distance calls on group movements. For each IGE aspect, I determined the effects of group size and resource value. I found strong evidence for female food defense by redtails and male food defense by both species, weak evidence of male mate defense by redtails and no evidence for mangabeys, and no evidence of female food defense by mangabeys. In addition, the specific conditions under which food defense is expected to occur in primates were appropriate for male mangabeys, but not for female or male redtails. This pattern of results indicates that existing hypotheses cannot accurately predict which populations will exhibit food or mate defense by males or females, or the specific social and ecological conditions that elicit defense. I also found that mangabeys exhibited two types of IGE: whole group encounters, where the majority of two groups were in visual contact, and subgroup encounters, where one or a few individuals left their group and interacted aggressively with a neighboring group. Whereas whole group IGEs appeared to function as defense of specific feeding sites, subgroup IGEs did not; instead, they appeared to be a means of defending the core of the home range. Compared to earlier studies, the mangabey groups in this study exhibited higher encounter rates and more pronounced aggression. Higher group densities and more intense feeding competition have given rise to a dramatically different pattern of mangabey intergroup relations. This study demonstrates the importance of considering multiple IGE aspects, hypotheses, and food characteristics when evaluating the role of intergroup relations in the lives of social animals...|$|R
