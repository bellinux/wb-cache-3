Wet or dry lubrication is recommended to reduce friction against the circlip, maintaining its function.|$|R
40|$|YesDynamic wetting {{failure was}} {{observed}} in the simple dip coating flow {{with a series of}} substrates, which had a <b>rough</b> <b>side</b> and a comparatively smoother side. When we compared the air entrainment speeds on both sides, we found a switch in behaviour at a critical viscosity. At viscosity lower than a critical value, the <b>rough</b> <b>side</b> entrained air at lower speeds than the smooth side. Above the critical viscosity the reverse was observed, the smooth side entraining air at lower speed than the <b>rough</b> <b>side.</b> Only substrates with significant roughness showed this behaviour. Below a critical roughness, the <b>rough</b> <b>side</b> always entrained air at lower speeds than the smooth side. These results have both fundamental and practical merits. They support the hydrodynamic theory of dynamic wetting failure and imply that one can coat viscous fluids at higher speeds than normal by roughening substrates. A mechanism and a model are presented to explain dynamic wetting failure on rough surfaces...|$|R
2500|$|When {{the ball}} is older {{and there is an}} {{asymmetry}} in roughness the seam no longer causes the pressure difference, and can actually reduce the swing of the ball. Air turbulence is no longer used to create separation point differences and therefore the lift and pressure differences. On the <b>rough</b> <b>side</b> of the ball there are scratches and pits in the ball's surface. [...] These irregularities act {{in the same manner as}} the dimples of a golf ball: they trap the air, creating a layer of trapped air next to the <b>rough</b> <b>side</b> of the ball, which moves with the surface of the ball. The smooth side does not trap a layer of air. The next layer of air outward from the ball will have a greater velocity over the <b>rough</b> <b>side,</b> due to its contact with a layer of trapped air, rather than solid ball. This lowers the static pressure relative to the shiny side, which swings the ball. If the scratches and tears completely cover the <b>rough</b> <b>side</b> of the ball, the separation point on the <b>rough</b> <b>side</b> will move to the back of the ball, further than that of the turbulent air, thereby creating more lift and faster air flow. [...] This is why a new ball will swing more than an old ball. If the seam is used to create the turbulent air on the <b>rough</b> <b>side,</b> the tears will not fill as quickly as they would with laminar flow, dampening the lift and pressure differences.|$|R

The other end of the dop is placed into the quill of the faceting head. The exposed piece of rough usually becomes the bottom of the stone, known as the pavilion.

2500|$|Reverse swing {{occurs in}} exactly the same manner as {{conventional}} swing, despite popular misconception. Over time the <b>rough</b> <b>side</b> becomes too <b>rough</b> and the tears become too deep – this is why golf ball dimples are never below a certain depth, and so [...] "conventional" [...] swing weakens over time; the separation point moves {{toward the front of the}} ball on the <b>rough</b> <b>side.</b> When polishing the shiny side of the ball, numerous liquids are used, such as sweat, saliva, sunscreen, hair gel (which bowlers may apply to their hair before a game) and other illegal substances like Vaseline (applied to the clothing where the ball is polished). These liquids penetrate the porous surface of the leather ball. Over time the liquid expands and stretches the surface of the ball (which increases the surface area meaning more lift) and creates raised bumps on the polished side, due to the non-uniform nature of the expansion. The valleys between the bumps hold the air in the same manner as the tears on the <b>rough</b> <b>side.</b> This creates a layer of air over the shiny side, moving the separation point towards the back of the ball on the shiny side. The greater air coverage is now on the shiny side, giving rise to more lift and faster secondary airflow on that side. There is therefore lower static pressure on the shiny side, causing the ball to swing towards it, not away from it as in conventional swing.|$|R
