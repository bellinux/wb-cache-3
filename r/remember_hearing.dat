25|$|I {{actually}} {{never met}} the Three Kings—it didn't matter how hard my little brother and I tried to keep awake at night {{to catch a glimpse}} of the Three Royal Visitors, we would always fall asleep just before they arrived. But I do <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> them. I remember the weird cadence of their song in the dark distance; I remember the brittle sound of the camel's hooves crushing the frozen snow; and I remember the mysterious tinkling of their silver bridles.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of the crash, Saint-Donat villagers <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> the noise of a large {{aircraft}} passing overhead and moments later an impact. Jos Gaudet, then on duty in fire tower number four at Archambault lake did see the light emitted by the burning wreckage on top of the mountain but thought of it as the reflection of the sun on a moist rocky slope. On the morning of the crash Gaudet and Georges Moore took a boat around lake Archambault to look for signs of wreckage such as oil slicks or debris, believing that the aircraft had fallen in the water. Later on, Mr. Moore went to the town hall to alert the military authorities but his claim was dismissed as being implausible.|$|E
500|$|In 1968, R singer Wilson Pickett {{released}} a cover recorded at Muscle Shoals, with guitar {{from a young}} Duane Allman, who recommended the choice to Pickett. Eric Clapton commented, [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> [...] and calling either Ahmet Ertegun or Tom Dowd and saying, 'Who's that guitar player?'...To this day, I've never heard better rock guitar playing on an R record. It's the best." [...] Pickett commented on the outro that [...] "people were going crazy" [...] and session musician Jimmy Johnson said that the Allman's solo [...] "created Southern rock".|$|E

500|$|In general, the First Lady's {{desire for}} {{everything}} to appear just {{right in the}} White House led the residence staff to consider her not easy to work for, with tirades following what she perceived as mistakes. One staffer later recalled, [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> her call for her personal maid one day and it scared the dickens out of me—just her tone. I {{never wanted to be}} {{on the wrong side of}} her." [...] She did show loyalty and respect to a number of the staff. In particular, she came to the public defense of a maid who was indicted on charges of helping to smuggle ammunition to Paraguay, providing an affidavit to the maid's good character (even though it was politically inopportune to do so at the time of the Iran–Contra affair); charges were subsequently dropped, and the maid returned to work at the White House.|$|E
500|$|Overnight figures {{indicated}} that the episode averaged 8.7million viewers and a 37% audience share. Official figures gave the episode ratings of 8.86million for its original airing and 740,000 for its 10pm repeat on BBC Three. Brown's performance in the episode was praised by Robert Hanks of The Independent who wrote: [...] "I don't ever <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> anybody on a soap talk like this before. I mean, like a real person, with real feelings, such as self-pity and a desperate urge for self-preservation. Brown conveyed the seedy gloom of it all beautifully, as well." [...] Nancy Banks-Smith of The Guardian deemed Brown possibly {{the only member of}} the cast, with the exception of Barbara Windsor (Peggy Mitchell), capable of carrying such a monologue, opining that she [...] "carried it off magnificently". She took issue with Dot's characterisation, however, believing that Dot is presented as the serial's [...] "moral compass", and would not leave her husband in a nursing home.|$|E
500|$|Brown's {{single-hander}} {{episode of}} EastEnders received much critical acclaim. The Guardian Nancy Banks-Smith deemed Brown possibly {{the only member}} of the cast with the exception of Barbara Windsor (Peggy Mitchell) capable of carrying such a monologue. Robert Hanks for The Independent wrote that [...] "I don't ever <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> anybody on a soap talk like this before. I mean, like a real person, with real feelings, such as self-pity and a desperate urge for self-preservation. Brown conveyed the seedy gloom of it all beautifully, as well." [...] Conversely, Tim Teeman posed the question in The Times: [...] "I know she’s a national institution and June Brown plays her like a dream, but was last night’s Dot Cotton extravaganza really that great? Or even necessary?" [...] Teeman opined that: [...] "Quite rightly, the producers want to eke as much gold out of the character and actress as possible: both are fantastic. But this was much-loved character overkill." [...] He deemed Dot a [...] "soap icon", however he also assessed that: ...|$|E

500|$|In 2011, Rolling Stone {{magazine}} ranked [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] {{at number}} 45 on [...] "100 Best Songs of the 2000s" [...] list, noting that Minogue had [...] "seduced the U.S. with this mirror-ball classic" [...] and that [...] "we've been hearing {{it at the}} gym ever since." [...] NME ranked the song at number 74 on their [...] "100 Best Track of the Noughties" [...] list, saying it [...] "encapsulated everything enviable in a well-crafted song" [...] and heralding it as Minogue's best single. In 2012, Priya Elan from NME ranked the song at number four on his [...] "The Greatest Pop Songs in History" [...] list, saying: [...] "It was unlike any song I <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> before." [...] In 2012, The Guardian included the song in their list of [...] "The Best Number One Records," [...] labelling it to be [...] "sleek, Arctic-blue minimalism, like an emotionally thwarted retelling of Donna Summer's [...] "I Feel Love." [...] In the same year, PRS for Music, a UK copyright collection society and performance rights organisation which collects royalties on behalf of songwriters and composers, named [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] the [...] "Most Popular Song of the Decade" [...] as it received the highest airplay and live covers in the 2000s (decade).|$|E

50|$|Willis {{testified to}} the Warren Commission in 1964 that she <b>remembered</b> <b>hearing</b> three shots, with the last two shots bunched much closer {{together}} than the first two shots. Specifically, Willis testified that the assassination started when President Kennedy was already waving (his waving motion does not start until Zapruder film frame 174) {{when she heard the}} first shot that she <b>remembered</b> <b>hearing</b> (from Z-165 through Z-208 the president was hidden by a large oak tree from the view of anyone located in the Warren Commission lone snipers lair). Like many Dealey Plaza witnesses, the first shot she <b>remembered</b> <b>hearing</b> sounded to her like a firecracker. She testified that this first shot hit President Kennedy because she saw the president immediately and nearly simultaneously quickly raise both his arms and clench his fists in front of his throat {{as a result of the}} first shot she remembered. Willis testified that she did not know where the second shot that she <b>remembered</b> <b>hearing</b> came from or went to. Willis testified that it was the third shot that she remembered that hit President Kennedy in his head. In 1978 Willis {{testified to the}} House Select Committee on Assassinations that she “had a distinct impression that the head wound to President Kennedy was a result of a front-to-rear shot“ when she saw his head “blow up.” In her 1989 video interview for The Men Who Killed Kennedy documentary, Willis stated that when she saw the president’s head explode in blood that she saw head matter came out the back of the president’s head, so, the head shot must have been fired from the front of President Kennedy.|$|R

2500|$|First {{there is}} {{explicit}} or conscious memory, {{which refers to}} the conscious recollection of previous experiences. [...] An example of explicit memory is remembering what you did last weekend. [...] When it comes to an anesthetized patient, a doctor may ask the patient after undergoing general anesthesia {{if he or she}} could <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> any distinct sounds or words while under anesthesia. [...] This approach is called a [...] "recall test" [...] because patients are asked to recall any memories they had during surgery.|$|E
2500|$|Absent from Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 are {{top-down}} levels, {{which in}} its predecessor symbolized an enemy attack while {{en route to}} a location. [...] When the game's producer Rey Jimenez was asked why they are being excluded, Jimenez responded “People liked them because they were in the original, but I don’t <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> anyone say that was their favorite part of the game. It doesn’t have the swinging, you know?” Jimenez also revealed that with Rearmed 2 level progression will be linear instead of allowing the player to pick and choose their path. [...] Players will, however, be able to return to previous levels using newly acquired abilities and weaponry to access areas they were previously unable to.|$|E
2500|$|I {{found him}} petulant... I don't <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> him laugh, or ever seeing him laugh. Everything that {{concerned}} him was very serious... He {{had a certain}} screen personality... but as an actor... I never made any contact with him. He wouldn't look at me. He'd say, [...] "I love you..." [...] he'd be looking out there some place. Finally, I said,"Alan, I'm he-ere!!"... I think he was very conscious of his looks. Alan would not look beyond {{a certain point in}} the camera because he didn't think he looked good... Jimmy Cagney was not tall but somehow Jimmy was at terms with himself, always. I don't think Alan Ladd ever came to terms with himself.|$|E
50|$|Like {{many other}} {{supporting}} witnesses, Brehm {{stated that he}} distinctly <b>remembered</b> <b>hearing</b> another separate shot after the shot which wounded the President's head. The latter shot missed hitting anyone and was the reason that Brehm quickly dragged his son to the ground, covering him protectively.|$|R
5000|$|He further {{testified to}} the Warren Commission that after he <b>remembered</b> <b>hearing</b> the first audible muzzle blast or {{mechanically}} suppressed fired bullet bow shockwave, the assassination then ended in a [...] "flurry of shells" [...] coming into the limousine that {{reminded him of a}} jet sonic-boom sound quickness.|$|R

2500|$|Present party designations {{have become}} empty of all contents... Vastly {{extended}} State expenditure, vastly increased demands from the taxpayer {{who has to}} provide the money, social reform regardless of expense, cash exacted from the taxpayer already at his wits' end—when were the problems of plus and minus more desperate? How are we to measure the use and abuse of industrial organization? Powerful orators find [...] "Liberty" [...] the true keyword, but then I <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> from a learned student that of [...] "liberty" [...] he knew well over two hundred definitions.

50|$|Like {{many other}} witnesses, Tague <b>remembered</b> <b>hearing</b> this first shot and likened it to a firecracker. He later {{testified that the}} first shot he {{recalled}} hearing occurred after the presidential limousine had already completed the 120-degree slow turn from Houston Street onto Elm Street and then straightened out. The motorcade then proceeded towards him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not supposing anything," [...] Anthony defended himself. He just <b>remembered</b> <b>hearing</b> of the trial.

He interrupted himself to suggest: ...|$|R
