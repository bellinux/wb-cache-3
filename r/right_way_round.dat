25|$|The reach method, (or hose trace method), is {{the most}} {{reliable}} as it will work in all cases where the DV is not snagged somewhere. The diver reaches back over the right shoulder to the low pressure hose feeding the DV, and loops thumb and fingers round the hose, then slides the hand along the hose, pulling it forward and over the shoulder until the DV is in the right hand, at which stage it can be turned the <b>right</b> <b>way</b> <b>round</b> and replaced in the mouth.|$|E
25|$|The rack {{bars are}} machine {{cut from a}} special quality of steel: the profile is not {{symmetrical}} and the bars must be installed the <b>right</b> <b>way</b> <b>round.</b> Bars tend to fracture between the fixings. When spotted these breaks are marked and then supported with wedges until the bar can be replaced. The pinions consist of an outer ring that is easily replaced. This ring is mounted onto a centre disc, and springs between the two reduce shock loads and allow the small movement needed to accommodate joints and curves. The pinion rings have symmetrical teeth and are turned round to double their working life.|$|E
25|$|These {{scenes are}} on the main, lower, section of the shaft, which was broken above the largest scenes, and {{possibly}} the two sections were not restored the <b>right</b> <b>way</b> <b>round.</b> Above the large scene {{on the north side}} is either John the Baptist holding a lamb, or possibly God the Father holding the Lamb of God, who opens a book as in Apocalypse 5:1-10. Above this (and another break) are two remaining figures of the Four Evangelists with their symbols that originally were on the four arms of the cross-head: St. Matthew on the lowest arm, and St. John the Evangelist on the top arm. The side arms and centre roundel of the cross are replacements, of purely speculative (and most improbable) design.|$|E

60|$|Wolfe, with 1200 men, {{made his}} <b>way</b> <b>right</b> <b>round</b> the harbour, and took {{possession}} of the battery at Lighthouse Point which the French had abandoned; planted guns and mortars there, and opened fire on the battery on the islet which guarded {{the entrance to the}} harbour; while other batteries were raised, at different points along the shore, and opened fire upon the French ships. These replied, and the artillery duel went on night and day, until, on the 25th, the battery on the islet was silenced. Leaving a portion of his force in the batteries he had erected, Wolfe returned to the main army in front of the town.|$|R

Recopying a daguerreotype will make the writing appear normal and rings worn on the fingers {{will appear on the}} correct hand.

50|$|Beer {{consisted}} of a cylindrical metal container 8+1/2 in in diameter and 9 in long containing seven or eight half-pint bottles. Each bottle was a SIP grenade - it contained white phosphorus, benzene, water and a strip of raw rubber, 2 in long, which dissolved and formed a layer. After a delay caused by a slow burning fuse, the metal container was tipped open and its contents allowed to fall out. Around {{the neck of the}} bottle was a small metal sleeve that held a heavy ball about 1 in in diameter. The ball was attached to a strip of canvas; this ensured that when the bottles dropped they fell the <b>right</b> <b>way</b> <b>round.</b> The SIP grenades would spontaneously ignite on shattering.|$|E

5000|$|In December 1912 the Theatre {{was renamed}} as [...] "The New Palace", {{presenting}} a forerunner of the TV talent show Opportunity Knocks. In 1919 Mrs Gertude Mouillot bought the theatre for £25,000, intending {{to open it}} as a cinema but owing to the steep [...] "rake" [...] of the circle, {{it was impossible to}} project pictures from the front. Accordingly a small annexe was constructed {{at the back of the}} stage and rear projection was used. Unfortunately this meant that any films shown had to be run all the way through on to a blank reel to make it the <b>right</b> <b>way</b> <b>round</b> for the audience and then re-run again afterwards to make it right for the next person hiring it. The annexe is still there today and greatly used.|$|E
5000|$|Prof. Bryan Coles, Professor of Liberal Studies at Imperial College wrote “these reconstructions (many {{of which}} compel assent) ... {{it would be}} a pity for {{scholarship}} not to profit from his (Konstam’s) imaginative researches”. Rembrandt was the first artist Konstam discovered to be using mirrors and similar usage by Diego Velázquez, Johannes Vermeer and Filippo Brunelleschi soon followed. The Konstam Maquette of Musicians comparative image is posited as solid evidence that Rembrandt used models and a mirror in the construction of his drawing of Four Musicians with Wind Instruments. The nearest flautist holds the flute the wrong way round and the oboist's hands are shown too close to the mouthpiece. This would not have occurred if the subject was drawn from true musicians. The second flautist has his instrument the <b>right</b> <b>way</b> <b>round,</b> proving the mirror reversal. Konstam has discovered 80 instances of this method of doubling the subject matter in Rembrandt's drawings. The Adoration of the Shepherds is the one instance where Konstam has found Rembrandt making two paintings, one from a mirror image and the other from life direct but both observed from the same position. Thus geometry is part of the proof.|$|E
40|$|Vascularised grafts of {{the tubes}} have {{practically}} been given up now that such {{progress has been}} made by in vitro fertilisation. All the same, the possibility of non-vascularised grafts must still exist. We have carried out an experimental study on the uterus of rats. A piece of the uterus 1 cm long was taken from each cornu. After switching the right to the left and vice versa, the grafts were sewn into new sites, either the right way up or the wrong way up, using a microsurgical suture technique. Three out of 20 animals that were operated on became pregnant after having been serviced by the male, of which one was pregnant in both horns. This success was usually associated with putting the graft in the <b>right</b> <b>way</b> <b>round</b> and with an absence of intra-peritoneal adhesions. Of those uteri that did not become pregnant only one had an almost normal histological appearance. All the other had lesions suggestive of more or less severe progressive inflammatory changes or of scar tissue formation. Much more work will be necessary to improve these results for this type of grafting before they can be used in women, whether they be auto or allografts. The main good result from this technique would derive from its ease of operation and eventually a reduction in immunological problems that arise from allografts...|$|E
