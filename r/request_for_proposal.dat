5|$|In January 2005, the US101 was {{selected}} for the VXX Presidential Helicopter Replacement Program, and was promptly re-designated as the VH-71. However, development was subject to delays, cost overruns, and engineering issues; Lockheed attributed much of these issues to unanticipated and extensive modifications being demanded by the government that had been absent from the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>proposal</b> (RFP) issued. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report in 2011 also recognised {{that a lack of}} flexibility and compromise {{on the part of the}} government had negatively impacted the programme. By late 2008, the cancellation of the VH-71 was looking increasingly likely.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} 1970, when NASA {{released}} a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>proposal</b> for 'Phase B' main engine concept studies, requiring {{development of a}} throttleable, staged combustion, de Laval-type engine. The request {{was based on the}} then-current design of the Space Shuttle which featured two reusable stages, the orbiter and a manned fly-back booster, and required one engine which would be able to power both vehicles via two different nozzles (12 booster engines with 550,000lbf sea level thrust each and 3 orbiter engines with 632,000lbf vacuum thrust each). Rocketdyne, P and Aerojet General were selected to receive funding although, given P's already-advanced development (demonstrating a working 350,000lbf concept engine during the year) and Aerojet General's prior experience in developing the 1,500,000lbf M-1 engine, Rocketdyne was forced to put a large amount of private money into the design process to allow the company to catch up to its competitors.|$|E
5|$|During 1982, the U.S. Army {{initiated}} the Light Helicopter Experimental (LHX) {{program with the}} aim of producing a replacement for several existing rotorcraft, including the UH-1, AH-1, OH-6, and OH-58 helicopters. It was a further six years until, during 1988, a formal <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>proposal</b> (RFP) was issued to various manufacturers, in time which the requirement had evolved into a battlefield reconnaissance helicopter. During October 1988, it was revealed that two separate teams, these being Boeing–Sikorsky and Bell–McDonnell Douglas, received contracts to proceed with further development work upon their submitted concepts. During the 1990s, it was announced that the program's name had been changed from LHX to simply Light Helicopter (LH). During April 1991, the U.S. Army decided to select the design proposal produced by the Boeing–Sikorsky team as the contest winner; shortly thereafter, the team received a contract for the construction of four prototypes, which were intended to be operated in an extended demonstration and evaluation phase. It was in that same month that the helicopter received its official designation, that being RAH-66 Comanche, issued by the U.S. Army.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, Biman {{put out a}} <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>proposal</b> for the {{acquisition}} of four wide-bodied aircraft to replace the DC–10s, but both the fleet renewal plans and the airline's expected privatisation were shelved by the government. A further attempt was made in 2005 to acquire new aircraft and plans were submitted {{for the purchase of}} ten new wide-bodied Airbus and Boeing aircraft at a total cost of $1billion. Boeing arranged to finance the purchase provided a guarantee was given by the Bangladesh government. After bureaucratic delays and a perceived lack of commitment from the government, Boeing lost interest and the plans were cancelled. A similar attempt to purchase medium-haul aircraft for domestic service was also postponed. In , Biman put out a tender for the dry lease of two Airbus A310-300 and two Airbus A300-600 aircraft for two years. The sole response to the tender came from Star Aviation of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).|$|E

25|$|In late January 2007 the USAF {{issued the}} KC-X Aerial Refueling Aircraft <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> <b>Proposal.</b> The RFP called for 179 (4 system {{development}} and demonstration and 175 production) tankers, in a contract {{worth an estimated}} US$40 billion. However, Northrop and EADS expressed their displeasure at how the RFP was structured and threatened to withdraw, leaving only Boeing to offer an aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, the USAF {{released}} a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>proposal</b> (RFP) {{for a new}} tanker program, KC-X, to be selected by 2007.

25|$|Transport Canada made a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>proposal</b> for {{an airport}} rail link in April 2001. In May 2003, the {{submissions}} were pared down to four pre-qualified private consortia, who were then invited to submit business cases. An SNC-Lavalin subsidiary named the Union Pearson AirLink Group {{was selected as}} the successful respondent to finance, design, construct, operate and maintain an airport rail link on November 13, 2003. The service was to be called Blue22, as a trip would take 22 minutes to or from Pearson with a stop at the Bloor GO/Dundas West TTC Station. Trains were to be refurbished Budd Rail Diesel Cars, and were expected to begin running between 2008 and 2010.|$|E
25|$|Up {{to three}} cost-plus {{contracts}} {{were to be}} awarded nine months after the RfP was released. An acquisition decision memorandum on 17 August allowed the program to award technology development contracts. It also initiated two reviews of alternatives including a revised analysis of alternatives and an analysis of non-developmental vehicles. The 18 August, the Army awarded technology development contracts to only BAE and GDLS. BAE was awarded $450 million while GDLS was awarded $440 million. SAIC followed up with a bid protest on 26 August further delaying GCV development. It believed the evaluations process was flawed and the evaluation took factors into consideration that were not stated in the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>proposal.</b>|$|E
25|$|A <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>proposal</b> (RFP) for the TFX was {{provided}} to industry in October 1961. In December of that year Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed, McDonnell, North American and Republic submitted their proposals. The proposal evaluation group found all the proposals lacking, but the best should be improved with study contracts. Boeing and General Dynamics were selected to enhance their designs. Three rounds of updates to the proposals were conducted with Boeing being picked by the selection board. Instead Secretary McNamara selected General Dynamics' proposal in November 1962 due to its greater commonality between Air Force and Navy TFX versions. The Boeing aircraft versions shared {{less than half of}} the major structural components. General Dynamics signed the TFX contract in December 1962. A Congressional investigation followed, but did not change the selection.|$|E

25|$|Aitken Spence {{first entered}} the power sector in 1996 {{in a joint}} venture with a Japanese {{investor}} to build two thermal power plants in Sri Lanka with the Government of Sri Lanka inviting private sector to invest in resolving the then power crisis. However, due to the longevity of the process in obtaining clearances, the Japanese partner backed out and in 1999, Aitken Spence (51%) partnered with Commonwealth Development Corporation Globeleq (29%), Baneras House of India (10%) and Wartsila Finland Oy (10%) to construct the Ace Matara Power Station (24.4MW) and Ace Horana Power Station (24.4MW). Subsequently, following a <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> <b>Proposal</b> by Ceylon Electricity Board in February 2002, Aitken Spence together with Caterpillar Power Ventures Corporation began the construction of the Embilipitiya Power Station (100MW), which came online in April 2005.|$|E
500|$|Tucson, Arizona based Big Splash Games {{was formed}} in late 2005 by three {{veterans}} of the videogame industry: Jon Blossom, Stephen Lewis and Michael Wyman. They came together to produce a prototype video game for the casual market. They worked on this {{for a few months}} when they were not working (they still held jobs within the industry to support themselves). This prototype was pitched to a few publishers in order to gain feedback. PlayFirst, though not interested in the prototype, issued the team a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>proposal</b> for an economic simulation game, hoping that Big Splash could produce another proposal. The next morning, Big Splash co-founder Stephen Lewis remembered that he had been told that some people, in particular women, [...] "have an almost religious connection with chocolate". Taking this idea he quickly wrote a proposal and forwarded it to his two partners. After brainstorming the idea the team decided that it satisfied PlayFirst's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>proposal,</b> forwarded a copy of the idea and received word from the publisher that they [...] "had {{hit the nail on the}} head".|$|E

Webb jumped in and defended von Braun, until Kennedy ended the squabble by stating that the matter was [...] "still subject to final review". Webb held firm, and issued a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>proposal</b> to candidate Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) contractors. Wiesner finally relented, unwilling to settle the dispute once and for all in Kennedy's office, because of the President's involvement with the October Cuban Missile Crisis, and fear of Kennedy's support for Webb. NASA announced the selection of Grumman as the LEM contractor in November 1962.|$|E

500|$|In 1981, the U.S. Air Force {{developed}} {{a requirement for}} an Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) as a new air superiority fighter to replace the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon. This was made more crucial by the emerging worldwide threats, including development and proliferation of Soviet MiG-29 and Su-27 [...] "Flanker"-class fighter aircraft. It would {{take advantage of the}} new technologies in fighter design on the horizon including composite materials, lightweight alloys, advanced flight-control systems, more powerful propulsion systems and stealth technology. [...] In 1985 the Air Force sent out technical requests for proposals to a number of aircraft manufacturing teams. The formal <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>proposal</b> (RFP) was issued in July1986, and two contractor teams, Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics, along with Northrop and McDonnell Douglas, were selected on 31October1986 to undertake a 50-month demonstration phase, culminating in the flight test of the two teams' prototypes, the YF-22 and the YF-23.|$|E
500|$|Amtrak {{employed}} {{a mix of}} inherited cars on its long-distance trains in the Western United States. Most of these were conventional single-level cars, but Amtrak had also inherited 73 Hi-Level cars from the Santa Fe. The Budd Company built these between 1954 and 1964; the bilevel design, with its superior views and smooth riding characteristics, was well-suited to the long distances in the west. Michael R. Weinman, {{who worked at the}} design firm Louis T. Klauder & Associates, recalled that when Amtrak issued a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>proposal</b> (RFP) in 1973 for a [...] "totally new" [...] passenger car, it [...] "was assumed" [...] that the design would be bilevel. Thirteen companies responded to the RFP; Amtrak selected the proposal by Louis T. Klauder & Associates. The design was finished by mid-1974 and Amtrak invited four companies to bid on its construction—Boeing, Budd, Pullman-Standard, and Rohr—with Pullman-Standard winning the contract.|$|E
500|$|American {{reconnaissance}} satellites first {{spotted the}} advanced Soviet Su-27 and MiG-29 fighter prototypes in 1978, which caused {{concern in the}} U.S. Both Soviet models were expected to reduce the maneuverability advantage of contemporary US fighter aircraft. In 1981, the USAF requested information from several aerospace companies on possible features for an Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) to replace the F-15 Eagle. After discussions with aerospace companies, the USAF made air-to-air combat the primary role for the ATF. The ATF was {{to take advantage of}} emerging technologies, including composite materials, lightweight alloys, advanced flight-control systems, more powerful propulsion systems, and stealth technology. [...] In October 1985, the USAF issued a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>proposal</b> (RFP) to several aircraft manufacturers. The RFP was modified in May 1986 to include evaluation of prototype air vehicles from the two finalists. At the same time, the U.S. Navy, under the Navalized Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF) program, announced that it would use a derivative of the ATF winner to replace its F-14 Tomcat. The NATF program called for procurement of 546 aircraft along with the USAF's planned procurement of 750 aircraft.|$|E
