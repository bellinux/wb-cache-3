For each question, the team has 60 seconds to unanimously agree on an answer; the available money decreases the longer it takes. Each contestant must enter the same response on their respective panel and then everyone must simultaneously lock in an answer and stop the clock. If the team answers the question correctly, they bank whatever money is left on the clock; if they are wrong, or if time runs out, their bank is <b>reduced</b> <b>by</b> <b>half.</b>|$|E

On his 'second debut' for Kidderminster, he put his side ahead in a Worcestershire Senior Cup tie against Stourbridge. He also scored on his league return against Woking at Aggborough, scoring in the 39th minute in a 1–1 draw.

5|$|The {{massacre}} at Kraljevo, {{as well as}} a similar and nearly concurrent massacre in nearby Kragujevac, was met with outrage by the Serbian puppet government, which responded with pleas, interventions and threats of resignation. The killings led German military commanders in Serbia to question the efficacy of mass reprisal shootings, as they pushed thousands of Serbs into the hands of anti-German guerrillas. The killing of airplane factory workers in Kraljevo convinced the OKW that arbitrary shootings of Serbs not only incurred a significant political cost but were also counterproductive. The ratio of 100executions for one soldier killed and 50executions for one soldier wounded was <b>reduced</b> <b>by</b> <b>half</b> in February 1943, and removed altogether that autumn. Henceforth, each individual execution had to be approved by Special Envoy Hermann Neubacher.|$|E

5|$|The parties {{reached a}} {{compromise}} which {{was recorded in}} the Kolozsmonostor Abbey on 6 July. They agreed that the tithe would be <b>reduced</b> <b>by</b> <b>half.</b> The payment of the rents, taxes and other levies due to the landowners and the royal treasury was suspended until the tithe was collected. The agreement abolished the ninth and prescribed that the peasants were only required {{to pay the rent}} to the landowners. The annual amount of the rent was fixed at 10 dinars, much lower than the rent from before the uprising. The noblemen also acknowledged the peasants' right to free movement, which could only be limited if a peasant failed to fulfill his obligations to the landowner. To keep the execution of the agreement under surveillance, the peasants were authorized to hold an annual assembly at Mount Bábolna. Their assembly was entitled to punish noblemen who had broken the compromise.|$|E
5|$|Several senior German {{military}} officials were tried and convicted for {{their involvement in}} the reprisal shootings at the Nuremberg trials and the subsequent Nuremberg trials. The massacre {{had a profound effect}} on the course of the war in Yugoslavia. It exacerbated tensions between the two guerrilla movements, the communist-led Partisans and the royalist, Serbian nationalist Chetniks, and convinced Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović that further attacks against the Germans would only result in more Serb civilian deaths. The Germans soon found mass executions of Serbs to be ineffectual and counterproductive, as they tended to drive the population into the arms of insurgents. The ratio of 100executions for one soldier killed and 50executions for one soldier wounded was <b>reduced</b> <b>by</b> <b>half</b> in February 1943, and removed altogether later in the year. The massacre is commemorated by the October in Kragujevac Memorial Park and the co-located 21stOctober Museum, and has been the subject of several poems and feature films. The day the massacre took place is commemorated annually in Serbia as the Day of Remembrance of the Serbian Victims of World War II.|$|E

25|$|So-called tipjets, {{actually}} {{hydrogen peroxide}} rockets, are {{placed at the}} tips of the rotor. The rockets are used only during takeoff and emergency landing, so they do not consume much propellant.

Furthermore, the engine weight and engine power may be <b>reduced</b> <b>by</b> <b>half</b> because a smaller engine is needed for takeoff. The Fairey Jet Gyrodyne and Fairey Rotodyne had true tipjets instead of the rockets. They were technically successful but were not mass-produced due to concerns about tipjet noise.|$|E
25|$|Performance of cross {{interleaver}} : As {{shown in}} the above interleaver figure, the output is nothing but the diagonal symbols generated {{at the end of}} each delay line. In this case, when the input multiplexer switch completes around half switching, we can read first row at the receiver. Thus, we need to store maximum of around half message at receiver in order to read first row. This drastically brings down the storage requirement by half. Since just half message is now required to read first row, the latency is also <b>reduced</b> <b>by</b> <b>half</b> which is good improvement over the block interleaver. Thus, the total interleaver memory is split between transmitter and receiver.|$|E

Royal licence had not previously been secured for the 1349 grant and a 200 mark fine was imposed by the king before they were allowed to retain the church.
