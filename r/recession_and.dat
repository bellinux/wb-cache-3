5|$|A study {{commissioned}} by Experian rated Trafford as {{the strongest and}} most resilient borough in North West England to dealing with sudden changes in the economy. Trafford's low reliance on vulnerable businesses in the current <b>recession</b> <b>and</b> its high proportion of multinational companies were two factors which give the borough its high ranking.|$|E
5|$|Global {{sales of}} Lexus {{vehicles}} reached {{an all-time high}} in 2007, {{with a total of}} 518,000. Sales decreased in subsequent years due to the effects of the 2008 <b>recession</b> <b>and</b> the Japanese tsunami of 2011. Following this, sales recovered and reached a new high of 523,000 in 2013.|$|E
50|$|As a result, {{government}} expenditure increases automatically in <b>recessions</b> <b>and</b> decreases automatically in booms in absolute terms.

5|$|After the war, Skopje was in ruins. Most of the {{official}} buildings were restored or rebuilt, but the city experienced new plague and cholera epidemics and many inhabitants emigrated. The Ottoman Turkish Empire as a whole entered in <b>recession</b> <b>and</b> political decline. Many rebellions and pillages occurred in Macedonia during the 18th century, either led by Turkish outlaws, Janissaries or Hajduks. An estimation conducted by French officers around 1836 revealed that at that time Skopje only had around 10,000 inhabitants. It was largely overwhelmed by two towns of the present-day Republic of Macedonia: Bitola (40,000) and Štip (15–20,000).|$|E

The scheme includes a hotel, offices, shops and eating places, and is expected to create 2,000permanent jobs. A further £20million is earmarked for a refurbishment of the nearby Altrincham Interchange. A 2010 survey found that despite being in one of the country's most affluent areas, {{nearly a third of the}} shops in Altrincham were vacant; Trafford council attributed the high number (78) to the effects of the <b>recession</b> <b>and</b> plans to refurbish Stamford House, which left most of its shops unused.|$|E

The saga over Gascoigne's proposed transfer to Lazio dominated the tabloid press throughout 1991, often overshadowing the key national news of that time – namely the <b>recession</b> <b>and</b> rise in unemployment that it sparked – although the broadsheet newspapers generally kept stories about Gascoigne confined to their back pages.|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{suggested}} {{that there is some}} relationship between banking crises <b>and</b> <b>recessions.</b> We assess whether there is evidence for interdependency between <b>recessions</b> <b>and</b> banking crises using both non-parametric tests and unconditional bivariate probit models and find strong evidence for interdependence. We then consider whether leading indicators can help predict banking crises <b>and</b> <b>recessions</b> <b>and</b> if these variables can explain the previously observed interdependence. Inclusion of exogenous variables means that the observed interdependence between banking crises <b>and</b> <b>recessions</b> disappears - indicating that the observed interdependence is a result of easily observable common causes rather than unobserved links...|$|R
30|$|Stability of {{revenues}} {{is an important}} feature of sub-national revenue systems. Because spending obligations generally increase in <b>recessions,</b> <b>and</b> states and localities are sharply constrained {{in their ability to}} run deficits, the greater the volatility {{of revenues}} over the business cycle, the greater the pressure to cut spending and raise taxes during <b>recessions,</b> <b>and</b> the greater the incentive to expand spending commitments and cut taxes during recovery. Such instability reinforces the pro-cyclical impact of state and local budgets.|$|R
5|$|Some unusual {{features}} of the Chinese vampire include its long, curved fingernails, perhaps derived from the appearance of growing fingernails on corpses due to flesh <b>recession,</b> <b>and</b> its greenish-white furry skin, perhaps derived from fungus or mould growing on corpses. Jiangshi legends have inspired a genre of jiangshi films and literature in Hong Kong and East Asia. Films like Encounters of the Spooky Kind and Mr. Vampire were released during the jiangshi cinematic boom of the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The Great <b>Recession</b> <b>and</b> {{the turmoil}} {{caused by the}} Arab Spring have {{depressed}} Jordan's GDP growth, damaging trade, industry, construction and tourism. Tourist arrivals have dropped sharply since 2011. Jordan's finances have also been severely strained by 32 attacks on the natural gas pipeline in Sinai supplying Jordan from Egypt by Islamic State affiliates, causing it to substitute more expensive heavy-fuel oils to generate electricity. In November 2012, the government cut subsidies on fuel, increasing its price. The decision, which was later revoked, caused large scale protests to break out across the country.|$|E
5|$|With {{the state}} still {{recovering}} from an economic <b>recession</b> <b>and</b> an election year upcoming, legislators refused to raise taxes. Collins eventually withdrew her request and submitted a continuation budget instead. Some education proposals advocated by Collins were passed, including mandatory kindergarten, remedial programs for elementary school children, mandatory testing and internship for teachers, and the implementation of academic receivership for underperforming schools. Among the other accomplishments of the 1984 legislative session were passage of a tougher drunk driving law, and a measure allowing state banking companies to purchase other banks within the state.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>recessions</b> <b>and</b> recoveries {{in advanced}} economies {{and the role}} of countercyclical macroeconomic policies. Are <b>recessions</b> <b>and</b> recoveries associated with financial crises different from others? What are the main features of globally synchronized recessions? Can countercyclical policies help to shorten <b>recessions</b> <b>and</b> strengthen recoveries? The results suggest that recessions associated with financial crises tend to be unusually severe and that recoveries from such recessions are typically slow. Similarly, globally synchronized recessions are often long and deep, and recoveries from these recessions are generally weak. Countercyclical monetary policy can help shorten recessions, but its effectiveness is limited in financial crises. By contrast, expansionary fiscal policy seems particularly effective in shortening recessions associated with financial crises and in boosting recoveries. However, its effectiveness is a decreasing function of the level of public debt. These findings suggest that the current recession is likely to be unusually long and severe and the recovery sluggish...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} nonparametric test that distinguishes 'depressions' and 'booms' from {{ordinary}} <b>recessions</b> <b>and</b> expansions. Depressions and booms {{are defined as}} coming from another underlying process than <b>recessions</b> <b>and</b> expansions. We find four depressions and booms in the NBER business cycle between 1919 and 2009, including the Great Depression and the World War II boom. Our {{results suggest that the}} recent Great Recession does not qualify as a depression. Multinomial logistic regressions show that stock returns, output growth, and inflation exhibit predictive power for depressions. Surprisingly, the term spread is not a leading indicator of depressions, in contrast to recessions...|$|R
5|$|American's service {{peaked in}} 1992 with 265 daily departures, after which flights were {{gradually}} scaled back until the hub eventually closed in 1995. American cited {{the aftermath of}} the early 1990s <b>recession</b> <b>and</b> the lack of local passengers as reasons for the closure. As American scaled down its operations, it subleased its gates to other carriers, largely in order to cover the debt used to construct the hub facilities, which American had guaranteed. Southwest Airlines quickly filled the void by seizing 54% of the Nashville market and making it a focus city, with American remaining as the second-largest carrier at Nashville, followed by Delta Air Lines.|$|E
5|$|Early {{attempts}} by Ernest Flagg {{to limit the}} height of New York's skyscrapers in 1896 failed; further unsuccessful attempts followed between 1906 and 1908, and legislation was turned down again in 1909, partially because of pressure from the real estate industry. After 1913, however, the property market in New York entered a <b>recession,</b> <b>and</b> vacancy levels in buildings began to rise. The campaign for change was helped by {{the construction of the}} Equitable Building in 1915 at the estimated cost of $29 million ($10.9 billion in 2010 terms), which rapidly became infamous as its vast height and bulk blocked views and cast neighbours into permanent shade. The real estate industry finally ceased its objections to new legislation, and the 1916 Zoning Resolution was passed.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, she {{returned}} to India {{in the wake of}} the economic <b>recession</b> <b>and</b> moved to Mumbai to stay with Priyanka. During a visit to Yash Raj Films studio, Priyanka (who was filming for Pyaar Impossible!) introduced Parineeti to the head of the public relations team of the company. Chopra obtained an internship in the marketing department, joining the production company as a public-relations consultant. She considered it a perfect job, because she could use what she had learned and work in films. Chopra had disliked actors and acting; to her, the profession seemed like an excuse to wear too much makeup. This changed when she observed Priyanka's preparations for her role in 7 Khoon Maaf (2011), which highly influenced her and changed her perception towards acting and actors. Once she learnt more about filmmaking, her respect for the profession increased.|$|E

5|$|Japan is {{the third}} largest {{national}} economy in the world, after the United States and China, in terms of nominal GDP, and the fourth largest national economy in the world, after the United States, China and India, in terms of purchasing power parity. , Japan's public debt was estimated at more than 230 percent of its annual gross domestic product, the largest of any nation in the world. In August 2011, Moody's rating has cut Japan's long-term sovereign debt rating one notch from Aa3 to Aa2 inline {{with the size of}} the country's deficit and borrowing level. The large budget deficits and government debt since the 2009 global <b>recession</b> <b>and</b> followed by the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 caused the rating downgrade. The service sector accounts for three quarters of the gross domestic product.|$|E
5|$|On 7 February 1999, Abdullah II {{ascended the}} throne upon {{the death of}} his father Hussein. Abdullah {{embarked}} on aggressive economic liberalisation when he assumed the throne, and his reforms led to an economic boom which continued until 2008. Abdullah II has been credited with increasing foreign investment, improving public-private partnerships and providing the foundation for Aqaba's free-trade zone and Jordan's flourishing information and communication technology (ICT) sector. He also set up five other special economic zones. During the following years Jordan's economy experienced hardship as it dealt with the effects of the Great <b>Recession</b> <b>and</b> spillover from the Arab Spring, including a cut in its petroleum supply and the collapse of trade with neighbouring countries.|$|E
5|$|On {{moving into}} , Thatcher {{introduced}} {{a series of}} political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain's struggles {{in the wake of the}} Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession. Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation (particularly of the financial sector), flexible labour markets, the privatisation of state-owned companies, and reducing the power and influence of trade unions. Thatcher's popularity during her first years in office waned amid <b>recession</b> <b>and</b> increasing unemployment, until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support, resulting in her decisive re-election in 1983. She survived an assassination attempt in 1984.|$|E
