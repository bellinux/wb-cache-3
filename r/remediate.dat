5|$|The southernmost {{part of the}} Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway, {{from south}} of DE 10 to north of Bay Road, was placed under {{construction}} in 1990 and opened along with the DoverSmyrna portion of DE 1 in 1993. US 113 traffic needed to use a temporary tie-in during construction, and after the new freeway opened, traffic on the U.S. Highway needed to use Exit 95 to transfer between the new freeway and Bay Road. The extension of the DE 1 freeway south through Dover Air Force Base was constructed later due {{to the need to}} coordinate negotiations with the military installation and to allow the base to <b>remediate</b> hazardous material sites, maintain security and access restrictions with construction of a new main gate, and reconstruct base housing {{on the west side of}} the highway. The main gate to Dover Air Force base was moved further east, and a diamond interchange was built between the main gate and the base housing area. The upgrade of US 113 and DE 1 through the military base was built in two phases, the first from 1996 to 1998 and the second in 1999 and 2000.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, various {{methods are}} being {{considered}} with appropriate amendments, not with conventional reclamation to recycle deteriorated soils after remediation as agricultural addition, backfilling and construction materials etc. Among these amendments, microbial amendments with effective microorganism(EMs) {{are known to}} improve soil qualities such as fertility, strength and toxicity to be recycled into possible utilizations. This study indicates the possibility of recycling the <b>remediated</b> soils by using these EMs most efficiently. Soil samples will be collected from contaminated sites with either heavy metals or petroleum and will be <b>remediated</b> by bench-scale soil washing and thermal desorption. And then the <b>remediated</b> soils will be treated with easily obtainable inocula, substrates (culture media) near our life and they are compared with commercial EM products {{in terms of the}} cost and efficiency. Also, after treating with a number of mixing ratios, soil properties of (1) fresh, (2) contaminated, (3) <b>remediated</b> (4) amended soils will be evaluated based on soil quality indicators depending on demands and the optimal mixing ratios which are effective than commercial EM products will be determined. The ratio derived from pre-tests could be applied on the <b>remediated</b> soils with pilot-scale in order to assess suitability for recycling and characterize correlation between soil properties and microbial amendments regarding contaminants and remediation, and furthermore for modelling. In conclusion, application of the established models on recycling <b>remediated</b> soils may help to dispose the <b>remediated</b> soils in future, including environmental and ecological values as well as economical values...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a discussion of}} the long term condition of <b>remediated</b> sediments from a geoenvironmental perspective. It examines the problem of long term maintenance of the <b>remediated</b> condition of treated sediments and establishes a set of goals and requirements for their sustainability. First, a number of basic interacting factors are considered in relation to treatment requirements for minimizing the potential for resuspension and remobilization. Next, a geoenvironmental engineering perspective is used to argue that the most viable means for sustainable <b>remediated</b> sediments preservation is to replace removed contaminated sediments with sediment material that has high attenuation capabilities and augment the natural recovery processes in the sediments. It is recognized that ultimate sustainability requires not only preservation of the <b>remediated</b> condition of sediments, but also habitat restoration and regeneration of biodiversity two important issues beyond the purview of this paper...|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the use of}} straw compost and <b>remediated</b> soil as inocula for bioremediation of chlorophenol-contaminated soil. The in situ biotransformation of pentachlorophenol (PCP) and mineralization of radiolabeled [U-(sup 14) C]PCP by straw compost and <b>remediated</b> soil were studied under field-simulating conditions before and after 3 months of adaptation with PCP in a percolator. After PCP adaptation, the straw compost mineralized up to 56 % of the [(sup 14) C]PCP. No partial dechlorination of PCP was found. The native straw compost did not mineralize PCP, but partial dechlorination of PCP occurred (i) at pH 8 under near-thermophilic conditions (45 (deg) C) and (ii) at pH 7 under aerobic and mesophilic conditions. No biotransformation reactions occurred at room temperature (25 (deg) C) at pH 8. Enrichment in the percolator enhanced the mineralization rate of <b>remediated</b> soil to 56 % {{compared with that of}} the native <b>remediated</b> soil, which mineralized 24 % of [(sup 14) C]PCP added. Trace amounts of chloroanisoles as the only biotransformation products were detected in PCP-adapted <b>remediated</b> soil.

25|$|Excavation {{processes}} can be {{as simple}} as hauling the contaminated soil to a regulated landfill, but can also involve aerating the excavated material in the case of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Recent advancements in bioaugmentation and biostimulation of the excavated material have also proven to be able to <b>remediate</b> semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) onsite. If the contamination affects a river or bay bottom, then dredging of bay mud or other silty clays containing contaminants (including sewage sludge with harmful microorganisms) may be conducted.|$|E

25|$|The castle saw further {{construction}} and remodelling in the 17th, 18th and 19th century, reinforcing the bastions. Between 1640 and 1662, during the Restoration War, the castle were repaired, including alterations {{to the line}} of walls, gates and barbicans that were in state of ruins, as well as necessary repairs to the town's defenses. From a report by Nicolau de Langres, the infantry garrison and cavalry left the castle of Castelo de Vide for Marvão, resulting in a compliment of 400. This concentration made the castle the primary line of defense. In 1641, Spanish forces attacked the fortress at Marvão, followed by a second wave in 1648. Repairs to the walls were undertaken in 1662, to <b>remediate</b> the damaged caused during the Restoration Wars, under the direction of Luís Serrão Pimentel.|$|E
25|$|Physical, chemical, and {{biological}} {{methods have been}} used to <b>remediate</b> arsenic contaminated water. Bioremediation is said to be cost effective and environmentally friendly Bioremediation of ground water contaminated with arsenic aims to convert arsenite, the toxic form of arsenic to humans, to arsenate. Arsenate (+5 oxidation state) is the dominant form of arsenic in surface water, while arsenite (+3 oxidation state) is the dominant form in hypoxic to anoxic environments. Arsenite is more soluble and mobile than arsenate. Many species of bacteria can transform arsenite to arsenate in anoxic conditions by using arsenite as an electron donor. This is a useful method in ground water remediation. Another bioremediation strategy is to use plants that accumulate arsenic in their tissues via phytoremediation but the disposal of contaminated plant material needs to be considered.|$|E
25|$|Aggressive: The {{new medium}} {{attempts}} to “absorb the older medium entirely, {{so that the}} discontinuities between the two are minimized” (p.47). Bolter and Grusin speak to the computer games Myst and Doom, which <b>remediate</b> cinema so that “players become characters in a cinematic narrative” (p.47). Video games allow for an (limited) ability to determine narrative within a subjective realization through the capacity to “decide where to look—where to direct their graphically realized points of view” (p.47). In regard to film, Bolter and Grusin, in part, understand this form of aggressive remediation as “an attempt to hold off the threat that digital media might pose for the traditional, linear film” (p.48). This form of aggressive remediation seeks a different form of transparency, through attempting making any electronic interventions invisible. This concealment of its relationship to earlier media, “promises the user an unmediated experience” (p.48).|$|E

25|$|Housing improvement: In {{an effort}} to reduce lead hazards in buildings, HPD and DOHMH created a grant program {{focusing}} on residential buildings in the Bushwick Initiative target area. As a result of this outreach, 64 buildings received lead abatement work worth approximately $750,000. 150 buildings were referred to HPD's Housing Litigation Division (HLD) for action. HLD brought cases to compel the owners of those buildings to correct outstanding violations, to obtain civil penalties for the owners' failure to comply with the Housing Maintenance Code and the Multiple Dwelling Law where appropriate, and to compel those owners who had failed to register with HPD to do so. In addition, where owners had failed to correct emergency conditions, including lead paint hazards, and had denied HPD's inspectors and contractors access to scope and complete the necessary work to <b>remediate</b> the conditions, the HLD obtained access warrants ordering the owners to allow HPD's inspectors and contractors into the buildings to complete necessary emergency repairs.|$|E
500|$|Bill and Jerri Osberg {{sued the}} state and seven other parties in April 2003 over runoff from the construction, {{claiming}} that it killed hundreds of trees and polluted ponds on their property. Later investigation uncovered damage to wildlife habitat in the Wisconsin River. Included in the original lawsuit were six individual WisDOT employees, the primary contractor and a local pet supply company. The court of appeals partially upheld a ruling by the district court dismissing the employees and the contractor from the lawsuit in March 2006. The pet supply company was reinstated in the case by the appeals court. The couple settled their claims, and the state pursued the matter against Pagel Construction in a related lawsuit. WisDOT alleged that the contractor did not follow proper erosion controls and failed to <b>remediate</b> the erosion damage to the Osbergs' property. The state wanted the construction company to forfeit their $70,000 retainer (equivalent to $ in [...] ) and pay damages of $150,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] ).
