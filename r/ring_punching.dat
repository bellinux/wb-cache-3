50|$|The first semi-final between Corporate-sponsored Mankind and fan-favorite Steve Austin started {{more with}} a brawl than wrestling; Mankind threw off his tuxedo jacket {{as the two}} {{exchanged}} rough punches until Austin landed in the corner at which point Mankind began to bite him before landing a knee drop into his face and using his shoe as a weapon. After receiving a Lou Thesz press and a stunner attempt, Mankind ran away but McMahon's cronies, who were at ringside {{caught up with him}} and stopped him. Austin caught him from behind with a clothesline and the two fought {{in and out of the}} ring with referee Mike Chioda reluctant to count out or disqualify either wrestler. As the two met back in the ring, they grappled so much that Mankind's shirt came out of his trousers, resembling more and more his old appearance by the time a double clothesline floored both wrestlers. Mankind was thrown a chair from the outside but as he ran it into Stone Cold, Austin put his foot up, kicking Mankind through the chair. Still, Mankind was unabated delivering a double-armed DDT onto the chair and when that would not keep Austin down, he tried a piledriver on the chair but Austin ran him forward then tossed him over his back so that he landed on the chair. He picked him up and executed a Stone Cold Stunner on the chair too and as he made what seemed to be the inevitable victory, McMahon jumped out of his wheelchair and pulled the referee out of the <b>ring,</b> <b>punching</b> him to the ground and kicking him. With Austin looking on in shock, Mankind applied the mandible claw but as his trousers fell down he had trouble maintaining balance. Austin threw him into the ropes and caught another stunner, covering him despite there being no referee; suddenly Shane McMahon ran down the ramp and slid into the ring counting, but then stopping suddenly at two and as Austin looked up, Shane sat up on his knees and gave Austin the finger. Gerald Brisco and Slaughter climbed in the ring and hit Austin with a chair, then Shane counted the pinfall advancing Mankind into the final. McMahon's entourage sped off quickly, jumping into a limousine and being followed by Austin.|$|E

50|$|Tools {{and punches}} can be interchanged for {{different}} part requirements.One advantage of hydroforming is the savings on tools. For sheet metal only a draw <b>ring</b> and <b>punch</b> (metalworking) or male die is required. Depending {{on the part}} being formed, the punch {{can be made from}} epoxy, rather than metal. The bladder of the hydroform itself acts as the female die eliminating the need to fabricate it. This allows for changes in material thickness to be made with usually no necessary changes to the tool. However, dies must be highly polished and in tube hydroforming a two-piece die is required to allow opening and closing.|$|R

There was chaos in the ring till trainers from both sides as well as officials break up the brawl with Grigorian still lying dazed with a deep cut over his eye. Groenhart later console Grigorian and they seemingly made up with Groenhart planting a kiss on Grigorian face. This led to speculation that a third grudge match between the two rivals is very possible.|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to reduce a manufacturing complexity of bottom sheet metal parts by improving the accuracy of parts produced. This study is aimed at using the finite element analysis to prove assumptions that there is a transition frontier between the processes of forming and drawing, and there are capabilities to control springback effect by moving this frontier positions. The process, the stress-strain state of which in the dome corresponds to the process of forming parts, and in the flange area to the drawing process, was considered to be a formingdrawing process. Based on previous studies, techniques to reduce a springback have been proposed which enable us to use three calculation schemes for the process simulation: The frontier transition position control between the processes of forming and drawing by changing the contact pressure on the flange by varying the frictions coefficients on the die and binder surfaces; Springback manage through the additional tensile forces in the flange area of the blank; Springback manage through the technological insert at the first process stage. For ease of comparison with previous research results the same geometric parameters and material properties of the items are used in the simulation. The springback analysis used a finite element method in the AutoFormTM incremental module with automatically mashed and standard tolerance computation properties. The blank, binder, punch, and die were then imported to the module by CATIATM interface in. iges format. The calculation has shown that the optimal value for the least thinning and springback parts are available for the second scheme whereby <b>ring</b> <b>punch</b> makes additional tension in the flange area (from 1. 09 to 0. 35 mm with thinning from 0. 80 to 0. 73 mm). The use of flange retention of sheet blank at the expense of variable frictional forces showed the springback value reduction by 4 times (from 1. 09 to 0. 27 mm). However thinning was 16 % (from 0. 80 to 0. 63 mm). Application of the scheme with technological insert allowed us to achieve the least thinning of the blank material (from 0. 80 to 0. 75 mm), but with only 1. 8 -fold (from 1. 09 to 0. 69 mm) springback decrease. As a result, it is found that in bottoms manufacturing the most preferred in terms of the smallest springback is the predominate forming zone, and the position of the transition frontier between the forming and drawing processes should be behind the cutting line of flange. </p...|$|R

5000|$|The {{most widely}} {{discussed}} example of Kayfabe breaking is the Montreal Screwjob, centered around a match in which then-WWF World Heavyweight Champion Bret Hart wrestled challenger Shawn Michaels {{for the championship}} at the Survivor Series in Montreal on November 9, 1997. Hart had previously {{signed a contract with}} rival World Championship Wrestling and still had three weeks left on his contract with the WWF. The agreed-upon finish was to have Hart retain the title that night and appear on Raw the following night to give up the championship. WWF head Vince McMahon had, months before, informed Hart that he could not financially guarantee the terms of his contract with Hart, encouraging him to make another deal if he was able to. As events transpired leading up to Survivor Series with Hart still champion and booked to remain champion following the event, McMahon feared that his championship would appear on his rival's television program. During the match, Michaels put Hart in the sharpshooter, Hart's finisher. Referee Earl Hebner signaled that Hart submitted, even though he had not. At the same time, McMahon came to the ringside area and directed the ring crew to ring the bell and announce that Michaels had won the match. Hart, very upset, spat on McMahon and began trashing equipment around the <b>ring,</b> later <b>punching</b> McMahon in the dressing room. While everyone involved in the incident maintain that it was legitimate some fans claim that it was a very elaborate storyline and only pretended to [...] "break kayfabe". and several within the business, Legitimate or not the [...] "Montreal Screwjob" [...] as it was referred to later on, has been recreated over the years by various companies as part of their own internal storylines.|$|R
40|$|Boxing {{has seen}} limited advancements {{in way of}} {{quantification}} of the sport during live professional fights. The PunchR system is an automated measurement system to collect information about a fight in realtime with fine-grained temporal resolution. The system employs nonintrusive accelerometers placed on the insides of boxers' wrists beneath their gloves to wirelessly relay acceleration data to a ringside laptop. Statistical models process the data for realtime estimates of fight metrics to quantify the action {{taking place in the}} <b>ring</b> including <b>punch</b> count, punch speed, punch force, and punch type. There are no new risks provided to the boxers during the fight nor do these accelerometers affect either of the boxers' physical performances. The statistical methods used to construct these statistical models are non-parametric in a sense that the data is really driving the modeling procedure without any notion of a structure prior to model construction. Data for the models is collected in a controlled experimental boxing setting or through video review of live fights. Model features are derived from the acceleration profiles of punches combined with boxer physical measurements to create a complete feature set to train the models. Primarily, the boxing metrics are largely tangible quantities that already are commonplace in boxing discussions (count, speed, force, and type) but have no prior method of measure. Methods are also developed to measure number of counterpunches and flurries using the timing of certain punches. Newly proposed metrics not in typical boxing terminology are either combinations of the common punch metrics or other measures taken from the acceleration data. These metrics attempt to measure a boxer's aggression and different measures of overall punch quality. The groundwork for these new contributions to boxing metrics and resulting visualizations for these metrics arise through the study of 65 professional boxing matches. Two complete fight summaries illustrate how a fight narrative can be told through use of the new metrics and visualizations. The PunchR system has been developed to begin the higher level quantification of boxing...|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} match saw Mari Apache defending her AAA Reina de Reinas Championship in an eight-way elimination {{match against}} Cynthia Moreno, Faby Apache, Jennifer Blake, Lolita, Mickie James, Sexy Star and surprise entrant exotico Pimpinela Escarlata, {{a man with}} a transvestite character. Throughout the match La Sociedads own referee, Hijo del Tirantes, favored his stablemates Blake, James and Sexy and in doing so helped in the eliminations of Moreno and both of the Apache sisters. In the end, the match came down to two La Sociedad members, James and Sexy, and Pimpinela Escarlata. While Faby Apache distracted Hijo del Tirantes, her sister re-entered the ring, performed a double clothesline on the La Sociedad duo and a sitout powerbomb on Sexy Star. After the Apaches cleared the ring, Escarlata pinned Sexy to eliminate her from the match. Shortly afterwards, Escarlata accidentally took out Hijo del Tirantes with a missile dropkick, which led to Mari once again entering the ring and giving him a senton bomb. This led to La Sociedad leader Konnan coming out and hitting Escarlata with a baseball bat. However, Escarlata was able to survive the following pin, as Hijo del Tirantes was not able to make the count and his replacement Piero took such a long time to enter the ring from the backstage area. As Escarlata surprised James with a schoolgirl roll-up, Konnan pulled Piero out of the <b>ring</b> and <b>punched</b> him in the face. James, who in AAA had developed a habit of surprising her opponents with a kiss prior to pinning them, was this time herself surprised by a kiss from Escarlata, who then used her disgust to his advantage and rolled her up with another schoolgirl, which led to Piero re-entering the ring and making the three count, while Konnan was preoccupied with tending to Hijo del Tirantes. With the win, Escarlata became the first man to ever hold the Reina de Reinas Championship. After the match, the Apaches and Lolita re-entered the ring to celebrate Escarlatas win over the TNA invader.|$|R
50|$|Broners next {{fight was}} {{scheduled}} for November 17, 2012, in Atlantic City at Boardwalk Hall, and was aired on HBO. The fight marked Broner's debut in the Lightweight division. The opponent was the WBC Lightweight champion and Ring No. 1-ranked Lightweight, Antonio DeMarco. Broner started the fight off boxing DeMarco, working behind his jab and using his shoulder roll defense to frustrate DeMarco. In the early rounds, Broner was able to hit DeMarco with his quick counter left hook several times. By the 4th round, Broner and DeMarco decided to stand toe-to-toe {{in the center of}} the <b>ring</b> and trade <b>punches.</b> It was Broner who got the better of the inside fight though, with his speed and quick combination punching taking its toll on DeMarco. By the 6th round, DeMarco was cut and his face was swollen in several places while still standing toe-to-toe with Broner, with Broner barely missing his right uppercuts and working the body of DeMarco as well. Then, in the 8th round, Broner opened up another fast combination which hurt DeMarco and then a swinging left uppercut sent DeMarco to the canvas for the first time in his professional career. DeMarco's corner stopped the fight right after the knockdown, giving Broner his second world title in as many weight classes.|$|R
50|$|Khan {{seemed the}} faster {{of the two}} early, but Garcia pretty quickly {{found a way to}} catch many of Khan's punches and was clearly finding the range with his own. Khan won the first two rounds and could have been on his way to winning the third, but with twenty-nine seconds left in the round Garcia countered a Khan {{combination}} with a left hook that caught Khan on the neck and dropped him to the canvas. Khan rose to his feet quickly but had been hurt by the punch, and referee Kenny Bayless took an extra few seconds after administering the standing eight count to make sure that Khan could continue. Garcia resumed his attack and nearly finished off Khan, who was saved when the bell rang to end the round. Eight seconds into the fourth Khan, now on unsteady legs, could not withstand a barrage of punches from Garcia, who was now taking control of the fight. Garcia kept pounding away at Khan, who lost his balance and touched the canvas with his gloves, thus forcing Bayless to administer another standing eight count as a fighter is considered down once any body part of his other than his feet touch the <b>ring</b> after a <b>punch.</b>|$|R

Foghorn warns Banty that the box may be a trap but opens the box anyway, revealing a coo-coo clock. The clock chimes and Banty punches Leghorn again.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to extend the process limits of the {{mechanical}} joining technique self-pierce riveting in currently critical application scenarios such as the joining direction "thick in thin", the joining of cast aluminum with limited ductility and carbon fiber reinforced plastics {{as well as the}} combination of self-pierce riveting with adhesive {{through the use of a}} new die concept. Core of the new process variant is the separation of the die in a die <b>ring</b> and counter <b>punch</b> in which the counter punch is moved during the joining process. Through the use of the additional kinematics of the die tool significant improvements with respect to the joint quality compared to the conventional process can be achieved at all investigated application scenarios. Especially remarkable potential has the new process variant with separated die when joining materials with limited ductility. By the application of the force-controlled counter punch and the resulting additional superposition of the parts with compressive stresses, in contrast to the conventional self-pierce riveting, cracking in the parts can be avoided completely. In the numerical studies, a basic understanding of the new self-pierce riveting process was generated and the main influence factors on joint quality could be identified. The in the project realized, consistent comparison between the conventional and the new self-pierce riveting technique with respect to joint quality, joint strength and process-induced component deformation provides information on the advantages and disadvantages of the different self-pierce riveting technologies...|$|R

40|$|Der Siedlungskomplex von Udabno in Ostgeorgien wurde in den Jahren 2000 bis 2007 intensiv archäologisch untersucht. Auf mehreren Bergkuppen befinden sich dicht beieinander drei Siedlungen in strategisch günstiger Lage. Die Untersuchungen von insgesamt 25 einphasigen und regelhaft, einheitlich orientierten, rechteckigen Grubenhäusern ergab eine zeitliche Einordnung der Besiedelung an den Übergang vom 2. zum 1. Jt. v. Chr. und damit in die Spätbronze-/Früheisenzeit. Mehr als 1400 stratigraphisch gesicherte Kleinfunde wurden während den Ausgrabungen dokumentiert. Das Spektrum umfasst zahlreiche Metall-, Knochen-, Keramik- und Steinartefakte. Aus der typologischen und funktionalen Zusammensetzung der Kleinfundinventare können verschiedene Aktivitätsbereiche innerhalb der Häuser und des gesamten Siedlungsplatzes abgeleitet werden. So beschränkten sich die Bewohner vor allem auf landwirtschaftliche Arbeiten wie die Viehzucht. Ebenso sind handwerkliche Tätigkeiten in den Siedlungen nachgewiesen. Funde wie zum Beispiel Spinnwirtel, Webkämme und Webgewichte belegen die Herstellung von Textilien in allen Siedlungsbereichen. In einzelnen Arealen fanden sich depotartige Niederlegungen von zum Teil noch im Herstellungsprozess befindlichen Schmuckstücken, wie Karneolperlen, Steinanhängern oder bronzenen Zierblechen. Innerhalb der Häuser dienten architektonische Strukturen (z. B. Lehmbänke) der Abgrenzung bestimmter Aktivitätsbereiche, so dass mit Hilfe der Kleinfunde Koch-, Arbeits-, Wohn- und Lagerbereiche lokalisiert werden können. Anhand von naturwissenschaftlichen Untersuchungen an ausgewählten Funden – wie zum Beispiel Mahlsteinen aus ortsfremdem Material – werden zudem Verbindungen zu anderen Gebieten aufgezeigt. This {{dissertation}} {{is based}} on the activities of the University of Tübingen at Troy and their implications for research related to Black Sea archaeology which goes back to the 1990 s. Udabno is situated about 40 km from the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, in the East Georgian region of Kakheti. Intensive excavation work in three large settlements was started in 2002 and finally completed in 2007. The investigations at the areas of Udabno I–III revealed single-phase settlements, which date in the Late Bronze-/Early Iron Age, i. e. the transition from the second to first millennium BC. According a conflagration the majority of the houses were destroyed. The inventories in these burnt houses were therefore preserved in situ. Altogether, remains of 25 houses were discovered. The aim of this thesis was to examine more than 1400 small finds which were documented stratigraphically during the campaigns. A special focus involved drawing conclusions about the everyday life and organisation in the settlements and trading activities of its residents. A second part of this dissertation includes important information on the production technology of metals, and the reconstruction of trade routes, based on grinding stones, and obsidian, which was the result of archaeometrical investigations. Among other finds, a large number of stone artefacts were analysed, including mortars and pestles, grinders and rubbers, pounders, pendants, and carnelian beads. Beside these artefacts, the assemblage includes metal finds in the form of spearheads, knives, pins, <b>rings,</b> and <b>punched</b> sheets. Almost all the metal artefacts are made of arsenic- or tin-copper. Iron is used only sporadically. In addition, there are some small finds made of bone and pottery, like combs, and seals, and also some obsidian objects. As a result of the investigation of the small finds and their architectural context {{it can be said that}} there is no compelling evidence for specific differences within the settlement that indicate social stratification. It is probable that the development of social stratification was prevented by the short duration of the settlement activity in this region.
