The building was damaged during the war, so in 1946, the School of Occupational Therapy moved to Oxford, whilst the patients moved to Clevedon. To ensure costs were kept {{down for the}} patients, Casson subsidised their treatment from her own funds. She began to <b>release</b> <b>control</b> of the projects in 1948, first by passing the school to a nonprofit company with her as vice-president and remaining as medical director. Then, in 1949, Casson created the Elizabeth Casson Trust which focused on occupational therapy treatment and education, {{with the majority of}} funds going to Dorset House school. In 1992, the school became part of Oxford Brookes University.|$|E

He accepts her challenge, {{which results in}} the creation of a self-aware hologram of Professor Moriarty (Daniel Davis). Pulaski joins Data and Lieutenant Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), but is captured by Moriarty who also takes over manual control of the Enterprise. Moriarty demands that they find a way to enable him to leave the holodeck, but is persuaded by Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) to <b>release</b> <b>control</b> and be stored within the ship's computer memory until a means can be found to grant his wish. (Years later, Moriarty is released from the computer and takes control of the ship's computer, again demanding his freedom. He is finally tricked into thinking that his wish was granted, but remains trapped inside a computer simulation ("").) ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the latter}} {{years of her}} time in the soap, Pauline changes from a caring mother into a more {{inflexible}} battle-axe. Pauline's relationship with Martin is often shown to be strained by Pauline's refusal to <b>release</b> <b>control</b> over his life. Though initially a teenage delinquent, following Mark's death in 2004, Martin becomes Pauline's [...] "dutiful son", forced to put his mother's wishes above those of his wife—a recurring theme within the serial. Eventually, this causes a rift between the two characters. When Martin goes against his mother's wishes in 2006 and rekindles a romance with his adulterous ex-wife Sonia, Pauline cuts him out of her life. Television personality Paul O'Grady addressed Pauline's refusal to [...] "share her son like a normal mother", commenting, [...] "she's suspicious of anybody that comes into the family who wants to take her son away from her. She has already lost one son; she has lost her husband, so she's hanging onto the last [...] like a mother tiger with her cub." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{involves a}} combined experimental and modeling study that builds on our previous DOE-sponsored work in investigating how KMnO{sub 4 } {{can be better}} used with in situ remediation of groundwater contaminated by chlorinated ethylenes (e. g., PCE, TCE, DCE). This study aims to provide scientific basis for developing a new long-term, semi-passive ISCO scheme that uses <b>controlled</b> <b>release</b> KMnO{sub 4 } as a reactive barrier component. Specific objectives of the study are (1) to construct <b>controlled</b> <b>release</b> KMnO{sub 4 } as a new reactive barrier component that could deliver permanganate at a controlled rate over long time periods of years, (2) to quantitatively describe release mechanisms associated with the <b>controlled</b> <b>release</b> KMnO{sub 4 }, (3) to demonstrate efficacy of the new remediation scheme using proof-of-concept experiments, and (4) to design advanced forms of <b>controlled</b> <b>release</b> systems through numerical optimization. The new scheme operates in a long-term, semi-passive manner to control spreading of a dissolved contaminant plume with periodic replacement of the <b>controlled</b> <b>release</b> KMnO{sub 4 } installed in the subsurface. As {{a first step in}} developing this remedial concept, we manufactured various prototype <b>controlled</b> <b>release</b> KMnO{sub 4 } forms. Then we demonstrated using column experiments that the <b>controlled</b> <b>release</b> KMnO{sub 4 } could deliver small amount of permanganate into flowing water at controlled rates over long time periods of years. An analytical model was also used to estimate the diffusivities and durations of the <b>controlled</b> <b>release</b> KMnO{sub 4 }. Finally, proof-of-concept flow-tank experiments were performed to demonstrate the efficacy of the <b>controlled</b> <b>release</b> KMnO{sub 4 } scheme in controlling dissolved TCE plume in a long-term, semi-passive manner. Another important thrust of our research effort involved numerical optimization of <b>controlled</b> <b>release</b> systems. This study used a numerical model that is capable of describing release patterns of active agent from <b>controlled</b> <b>release</b> systems of varied forms and applications. We manufactured prototype single- and double-layered matrix-type <b>controlled</b> <b>release</b> systems and tested their release patterns using numerical simulations and column experiments. In a series of simulations, we demonstrated that an encapsulated, dispersed-agent polymeric matrix-type <b>controlled</b> <b>release</b> system could deliver active agent at a predetermined constant rate for long time periods of years and decades. Such long-term, constant release system is useful in the construction of fertilizers, herbicides, or implantable drug delivery devices as well as in subsurface treatment. Construction of more advanced forms of <b>controlled</b> <b>release</b> systems is currently under way...|$|R
