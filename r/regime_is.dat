5|$|Intrinsic {{diffusion}} {{occurs on}} a uniform surface (e.g. lacking steps or vacancies) {{such as a}} single terrace, where no adatom traps or sources are present. This <b>regime</b> <b>is</b> often studied using field ion microscopy, wherein the terrace is a sharp sample tip on which an adparticle diffuses. Even {{in the case of}} a clean terrace the process may be influenced by non-uniformity near the edges of the terrace.|$|E
5|$|Mass {{transfer}} diffusion {{takes place}} in the case where adparticle sources and traps such as kinks, steps, and vacancies are present. Instead of being dependent only on the jump potential barrier Ediff, diffusion in this <b>regime</b> <b>is</b> now also dependent on the formation energy of mobile adparticles. The exact nature of the diffusion environment therefore plays a role in dictating the diffusion rate, since the formation energy of an adparticle is different for each type of surface feature as is described in the Terrace Ledge Kink model.|$|E

It is studied especially inflation, growth and financial crises. It’s found that for emerging market countries, fixed <b>regimes</b> <b>are</b> associated with lower inflation than floats. On growth effect of exchange rate <b>regime</b> choice <b>is</b> not same all period. Fixed <b>regimes</b> <b>are</b> associated with faster growth but after 1990 fixed regimes brought about slower growth.

Tilting of {{the young}} {{continental}} margin created the first tectonic regime, the ultimate cause of this was thermal subsidence after continental breakup. The second <b>regime</b> <b>was</b> the direct cause of the uplift of the Angolan coast, mostly in the Oligo-Miocene but continuing into the Plio- Pleistocene, while the late tectonic <b>regime</b> <b>was</b> probably the differential movement of reactivated crustal blocks, whose slip directions depended on their orientation...|$|R

5|$|Dissent within Uganda and Amin's {{attempt to}} annex the Kagera Region of Tanzania in 1978 {{led to the}} Uganda–Tanzania War and the demise of his eight-year regime. Amin then went into exile, first in Libya and then in Saudi Arabia, where he lived until his death on 16 August 2003. Amin's rule was {{characterized}} by rampant human rights abuses, political repression, ethnic persecution, extrajudicial killings, nepotism, corruption, and gross economic mismanagement. The number of people killed {{as a result of}} his <b>regime</b> <b>is</b> estimated by international observers and human rights groups to range from 100,000 to 500,000.|$|E
5|$|After the High Councillor's {{downfall}} and the regime's {{defeat in}} Metropolis, the <b>Regime</b> <b>is</b> dismantled {{and all of}} its accomplices are arrested. Harley Quinn has the Joker sent back to the prime universe after realizing that he does not care about her, Green Lantern hands over his counterpart and Sinestro to the Guardians of the Universe to stand trial, and Wonder Woman dethrones her counterpart. The dictator Superman is placed in a prison emitting red sun radiation that renders him powerless, and his prime counterpart admits that if he were placed in the same position, he might have done the same thing. The alternate Batman tells Superman that he hopes that Superman never has to learn what he could be capable of if he turns evil, and warns him that if something ever happens to him, causing him to go down the path of his counterpart, he will come after him. As they walk away, the alternate Superman's eyes glow red, indicating he still has some degree of his powers.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies how {{the choice}} of fixed or {{flexible}} exchange rate <b>regimes</b> <b>is</b> affected by the existence of intensive and extensive margins. We study two models where firms enter during or before each period of production. We show how the {{the choice of}} those regimes depend on the level and the volatily of the intensive and extensive margins {{as well as on}} the congruence between consumers' preferences and the supply and diversity of products. We show that fixed exchange rate <b>regimes</b> <b>are</b> preferred for high enough labor supply elasticities. Fixed exchange rate <b>regimes</b> <b>are</b> unambigously better when entry occurs at the same time as production in each period. Fixed exchange rate <b>regimes</b> <b>are</b> less attractive in the presence of production lags and higher love of product diversity...|$|R

50|$|It {{is in its}} {{capacity}} as a social movement that food <b>regime</b> analysts <b>are</b> interested in food sovereignty. With its Marxist influences, food <b>regime</b> theorists <b>are</b> interested in how moments of crisis within a particular food <b>regime</b> <b>are</b> expressive of the dialectical tension that animates movement between such configurations (i.e., periods of transition). According to leading theorist Philip McMichael, food <b>regimes</b> <b>are</b> always characterised by contradictory forces. Consolidation of a regime does not so much resolve as it does contain, or else strategically accommodate, these tensions; meanwhile, their intensification, often via the mobilisations of social movements, often signals a period of transition.|$|R
