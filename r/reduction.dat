Seventy-seven PTSD patients with mixed traumas went through 8 to 12 sessions of imaginal exposure and exposure in vivo without any cognitive interventions.

Design and Setting. Descriptive study nested within a community-based randomized controlled trial on prolotherapy injections and exercises. Patients. A total of 110 participants with chronic low back pain. Interventions. Prior to treatment, participants were asked what minimum percentage <b>reductions</b> in pain and disability would make treatment worthwhile and what percentage <b>reductions</b> in pain and disability they desired with treatment. Outcome Measures. Minimum worthwhile <b>reductions</b> and desired <b>reductions</b> in pain and disability. Results. Median (inter-quartile range) minimum worthwhile <b>reductions</b> were 25 % (20 %, 50 %) for pain and 35 % (20 %, 50 %) for disability. This compared with desired <b>reductions</b> of 80 % (60 %, 100 %) for pain and 80 % (50 %, 100 %) for disability. The internal consistency between pain and disability responses was high (Spearman's coefficient of association of 0. 81 and 0. 87, respectively). A significant association existed between minimum worthwhile <b>reductions</b> and desired <b>reductions,</b> but no association was found between these two factors and patient age, gender, pain severity or duration, disability, anxiety, depression, response to treatment, or treatment satisfaction.
