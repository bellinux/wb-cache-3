5|$|Sea vessels were {{required}} by law to register at the Castellania to operate in Maltese waters and each had to pay a minimum ten grani, {{depending on the size of}} the vessel and its purpose. With the Registri Patentarum, the Castellania issued legal patents for galleys to travel from the port of Valletta to other ports and vice versa. The patents gave details subject to health inspections which included the names of the merchants and the description of the belongings for trade. Those galleys coming from non-European ports or from places subjected to possible disease were withheld in quarantine for days and only given permission to mix with the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> once a Pratica was issued by the Commission of Public Health. The Clean Bill of Health continued to be issued and gradually reformed during the British period, under the supervision of the Chief Medical Officer. The Castellania imposed a charge for those not having health assurance and having to lodge at the Lazzaretto.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{go to the}} Shipley {{house and}} find the {{bathroom}} door barricaded shut, no sign of any people. The two have a brief run-in with Deputy Greer who believes they are burglars until Mulder disarms the man and Scully shows him her FBI ID. They attempt {{to go to the}} airport but are trapped by the hurricane. Elsewhere at the Breakers Condominiums, Deputy Greer encounters the creature after finding a dead man covered in a slimy substance on a toilet. Mulder and Scully later find the deputy's vehicle parked outside the apartments. Searching the building, they discover Greer on the ground, his neck covered with red welts. Mulder goes around the complex to find the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> and warn them that the thing is in the plumbing. He encounters Dougie, a looter, Walter Suarez whose girlfriend Angela Villareal is nine months pregnant, and George Vincent, an anti-government Second Amendment activist. Mulder attempts to get Vincent to come out and join them for his own protection. Vincent refuses but, after being attacked by the creature in his apartment, relents. Mulder hypothesizes that the entity attacking them was driven {{from the bottom of the}} sea by the hurricane into the city's water system.|$|E

25|$|The Duala {{continued}} to prosper. Though the French had largely stripped their kings of power, {{almost half of}} the ethnic group's 15-20,000 members were important traders, plantation managers or owners, chiefs, or clerks in the civil service by the 1930s. The <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> were fishermen and farmers. By the 1940s, many Duala had attained prominence as builders, as well, servicing the growing cities of Douala and Victoria.|$|E
25|$|In 1914, Russia {{entered the}} First World War by attacking the Germans and the Austrians from the east, but {{soon it was}} pushed back {{in a series of}} devastating German victories, which {{eventually}} left almost the entire Baltic region in German hands. The Livonian Coast was occupied by the Germans in 1915. At their approach, many Livonians fled their homes, often never to return. Their main destinations were Estonia and inner parts of Latvia. The <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> were driven from their homes by the Germans and had to wait until 1919 before they were allowed to return.|$|E

50|$|Del Monte {{and other}} {{contemporary}} writers like Félix Varela, José Antonio Saco, and José de la Luz y Caballero, {{identified themselves as}} autonomous nationalists. Most of them envisioned a Cuba without black or mixed Cuban races. In that sense they all had patriarchal beliefs.

25|$|On February 15, 1858, a {{group of}} 151 Icarians took {{possession}} {{of a few hundred}} acres in Cheltenham, St. Louis, Missouri. These Cabetists used Cabet's money and put down $500 on a $25,000 mortgage for thirty-nine acres and three buildings southwest of this city. Adjusting to a new area and new locals was difficult, but the Icarians adopted a constitution, a replica of the Nauvoo one, worked in the city, and enrolled their children into the local public schools. The colony quickly fell into various arguments. During the Civil War, many young men joined the Union cause. By 1864, only about twenty residents remained on the property. For the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> epidemics of dysentery and cholera occurred in the warmer months. Because the Icarians could not meet the mortgage payments, in March 1864, Arsène Sauva returned the keys to the property to St. Louis banker Thomas Allen (from whom the property had been purchased in 1858), leaving a large debt. That same year, most members left the community, and the Cheltenham Icaria was no longer extant.|$|E

2500|$|... is {{regarded}} by biblical scholars as {{key to understanding}} the Urim and Thummim; the passage describes an attempt to identify a sinner via divination, by repeatedly splitting the people into two groups and identifying which group contains the sinner. In the version of this passage in the Masoretic Text, it describes Saul and Jonathan being separated from the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> and lots being cast between them; the Septuagint version, however, states that Urim would indicate Saul and Jonathan, while Thummim would indicate the people. In the Septuagint, a previous verse uses a phrase which is usually translated as inquired of God, which is significant as the grammatical form of the Hebrew implies that the inquiry was performed by objects being manipulated; scholars view it as evident from these verses and versions that cleromancy was involved, and that Urim and Thummim were {{the names of the}} objects being cast.|$|E
2500|$|The Tosefta {{reasoned}} that if God charged even the wise and righteous Joshua {{to keep the}} Torah near, then so much more so should the rest of us.

But the 12th century Spanish commentator Abraham ibn Ezra taught that the words [...] "God of the spirits" [...] just explain the word [...] "God," [...] indicating that God could destroy the congregation because God had their spirits in God's hand. Ibn Ezra acknowledged that some say that [...] "God of the spirits" [...] means that God has the power to investigate human souls, and that God knew that one man — Korah — alone sinned and caused the others to sin. But Ibn Ezra wrote that he believed that the words [...] "Separate yourselves from among this congregation" [...] in [...] refer to Korah and his congregation — and not to the entire congregation of Israel — and that God destroyed Korah's congregation.|$|E
