During the past decades, it has been well documented that this phenolic compound has health benefits and a protective action has been found in preclinical studies against several diseases. Here we review its bioavailability in humans and several assays showing significant results related with cardiovascular diseases, cancer and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Mechanisms of action include potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, among others. The importance of hydroxytyrosol in protection of low density lipoproteins (LDL) and consequently its implication in the reduction of cardiovascular disease risk has been highlighted by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), concluding that 5 mg of hydroxytyrosol and its derivatives should be consumed daily to reach this effect at physiological level. We discuss the potential uses of this compound in supplements, nutraceutic foods or topical formulations in the disease risk reduction. Finally, we conclude that more studies are needed to sustain or <b>reject</b> many other <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> not yet fully documented and to validate these newly available hydroxytyrosol-based products, because it seems to be a good candidate to reduce the risk of diseases mentioned...|$|R

40|$|Food {{manufacturers}} are increasingly placing <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> on their products like “important for eyesight” or “calcium {{is good for}} bones”. In order to protect consumers from erroneous claims and misleading information and to prevent unfair competition, uniform provisions have been introduced within the EU for <b>health</b> <b>claims.</b> The legal foundation is Regulation (EC) No. 1924 / 2006 on nutrition and <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> made on food. According to this Regulation, food manufacturers may only use <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> in future when they are contained in an EU positive list. The precondition {{for this is that}} the claim is based on generally recognised scientific evidence and is correctly understood by consumers. At the present time, <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> which are used for food, including food supplements, are being examined for inclusion in the EU positive list.

The objective {{of this research was}} to study how <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> affect consumers' perception of other product attributes. A survey with a total of 4612 respondents from the Nordic countries explored consumers' perceptions of attractiveness, healthiness, naturalness, tastiness and ability to reduce risk of disease by comparing ratings of products with and without <b>health</b> <b>claims.</b> Used claims varied in their benefit, active ingredient, claim structure and framing. The results showed that <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> had a moderate but mostly negative impact on theÂ perception of other product attributes; the most significant impact was decrease in perceived naturalness. Consumers could also interpret the benefits in claims as intended. The wording of the claim had only small impact on the perception of the products, whereas earlier market presence of the ingredient had a large impact: differences among the Nordic countries reflected the previous exposure to <b>health</b> <b>claims.</b> The findings from this study suggest that consumers do not imply other health benefits from <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> and the <b>health</b> <b>claim</b> per se is not likely to cause any unrealistic positive inferences in perceived product quality. <b>Health</b> <b>claim</b> Healthiness Product quality Product attributes Consumer Attitude Food choice...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to survey the {{labelling}} of drinks with pronounced health benefits found on the Swedish market today and to evaluate whether they are in accordance to EU and national regulations or not. Especially the nutrition and <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> were looked into. This study shows that there are several drinks with <b>claimed</b> <b>health</b> effects being sold today. The process of approaching full functioning regulations in the EU on nutrition and <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> is proceeding slowly. A snapshot of today�’s market of drinks with pronounced health effects shows that there are multiple cases of misleading statements and interfering labelling on the products. Often it concerns nutritional labelling or <b>health</b> <b>claims.</b> In this study a total of 60 <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> were found on the products. The <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> were made on 10 different vitamins, seven different minerals, five other substances, dietary fibre (one claim) and lactic acid bacteria (three <b>claims).</b> One <b>health</b> <b>claim</b> had reached a final decision from the European Commission and is no longer allowed. For 44 <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> found in this study similar claims were found in EFSA�’s (European Food Safety Authority) Register of questions database and the evaluations of these were used to estimate the outcome for those claims found in the study. The estimation reveals that 38 <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> might be approved though 13 of these might be considered to be misleading since the EU population does not have an inadequate intake of the subject of the claim. Six of the <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> might not be permitted to use.

40|$|The Nutrition and <b>Health</b> <b>Claim</b> Regulation 1924 / 2006 /EC, {{together}} with EFSA guidances on the scientific requirements for {{different type of}} <b>health</b> <b>claims,</b> is setting the basis for <b>health</b> <b>claim</b> substantiation in the EU. Aim The aim of this presentation is {{to bring up the}} key challenges that the food industry and clinical research organizations are facing when meeting these requirements. Results and discussion Key issues in clinical research planning to meet the requirements set for the <b>health</b> <b>claim</b> substantiation are: (1) Selection of right outcome markers since the selection of outcome marker defines actually the formulation of the <b>health</b> <b>claim</b> to be used on food or food ingredient.

From the regulation point of view, a single risk factor approach is emphasized, but from the clinical and scientific point of view the pattern of different risk markers or biomarkers could, in some cases, be a more relevant choice to reflect the final health outcome.

Results and conclusions We find that risk perceptions for obesity, diabetes and cardiac illnesses are lower (higher) for the restaurant with stronger (lower) <b>health</b> <b>claims,</b> i. e., Subway (McDonald's). Moreover, we also find that food deprivation levels moderate this effect, such that health risk underestimation is aggravated for individuals who suffer from food insufficiency.

The European Union wanted {{to regulate the}} use of <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> on products. An online survey was carried out to evaluate the situation, particularly of small and medium-sized companies, dealing with the new regulation. Methods: The online survey on <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> was conducted with 16 enterprises. To underline the findings a SWOT (Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis {{was made of the}} {{nutrition and}} <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> regulation regarding small and medium-sized companies in the European food and drink market. Results: The findings of this study indicated that the European Union did {{a step in the right}} direction. Most companies defined the decent competition, the simplified trade within the inner-European market, and the consumer protection as positive aspects.

40|$|The {{publication}} of a Preliminary Final Assessment Report on 4 April 2007 heralded another step towards {{the introduction of a}} new <b>Health</b> <b>Claims</b> Standard to be inserted into the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code. This <b>Health</b> <b>Claims</b> Standard, once approved by the Board of Food Standards Australia New Zealand and by the Australia New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council, will permit the making of certain substantiated <b>health</b> <b>claims.</b> Prior to the introduction of the new Standard, <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> have not been permitted on food labels, with the exception of claims in relation to maternal folate consumption and its positive effect in reducing the risk of foetal neural tube defects. The new <b>Health</b> <b>Claims</b> Standard as outlined in the Preliminary Final Assessment Report is likely to {{have a significant impact on}} the dairy industry. This paper seeks to analyse that impact, including threats, opportunities and challenges that the Standard poses to the dairy industry and other food suppliers. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> on {{purchase}} intent, emotional response and liking {{has never been}} previously reported. In this study prebiotic enriched bread {{was used as a}} model functional food. Purchase intent, emotional response and liking were investigated in 3 phases: 1 : focus groups were used to gauge consumer perception of <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> and functional foods. 2 : the impact of <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> on purchase intent and emotional responses were measured using an online survey (n = 122) and 3 : hedonic ratings on bread rolls presented with or without any associated claims were obtained (n = 100). A cluster analysis of the purchase intent data identified two clusters of consumers who were either receptive or non-receptive to <b>health</b> <b>claims.</b> Receptive and non-receptive consumers significantly differed in the emotions they reported with respect to the claims. The hedonic ratings did not significantly differ between the breads tasted with or without <b>health</b> <b>claims...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background The Nutrition and <b>Health</b> <b>Claim</b> Regulation 1924 / 2006 /EC, {{together}} with EFSA guidances on the scientific requirements for {{different type of}} <b>health</b> <b>claims,</b> is setting the basis for <b>health</b> <b>claim</b> substantiation in the EU. Aim The aim of this presentation is {{to bring up the}} key challenges that the food industry and clinical research organizations are facing when meeting these requirements. Results and discussion Key issues in clinical research planning to meet the requirements set for the <b>health</b> <b>claim</b> substantiation are: (1) Selection of right outcome markers since the selection of outcome marker defines actually the formulation of the <b>health</b> <b>claim</b> to be used on food or food ingredient. (2) Selection of right target population since that determines the target consumer group for the food with a <b>health</b> <b>claim.</b> (3) Selection of dose regime and food matrices used since these largely determine the conditions set {{for the use of the}} <b>health</b> <b>claim.</b> One of the major challenges in <b>health</b> <b>claim</b> substantiation is the deviant approach to risk factors or biomarkers. From the regulation point of view, a single risk factor approach is emphasized, but from the clinical and scientific point of view the pattern of different risk markers or biomarkers could, in some cases, be a more relevant choice to reflect the final health outcome. This is especially the case in the nutrition and health area because we are often dealing with weak but multiple health effects of certain food items or ingredients. Also the lack of validated well-established biomarkers potent to be affected by diet is a challenge in <b>health</b> <b>claim</b> substantiation. The selection of right target population is often a compromise between choosing a more potential target group to obtain efficacy (i. e. risk factors elevated vs. patient groups) and choosing a rationale to generalize the results to wider population (target consumer) group. The selection of optimal dosing regime and matrices for a clinical study is partly dependent on previous scientific data on the dose response, if existing. But equally important is the choice of feasible doses from product formulation and food consumption point of view. Conclusion With careful analysis of the existing data, advance planning and clinical research strategy it is possible to build up a <b>health</b> <b>claim</b> substantiation that meets the requirements both of Nutrition and <b>Health</b> <b>Claim</b> Regulation and EFSA...|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of studies examining {{the effect of}} nutrition information on food packets (such as the nutrition information panel (NIP), front-of-pack labels (FoPLs) and <b>health</b> <b>claims)</b> have examined each in isolation, even though they often occur together. This study investigated the relationship between FoPLs and <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> since (i) they both appear {{on the front of}} packs and typically receive more attention from consumers than the NIP, (ii) they can convey contradictory messages (i. e., <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> provide information on nutrients that are beneficial to health while FoPLs provide information on nutrients associated with increased health risks) and (iii) there is currently scant research on how consumers trade off between these two sources of information. Ten focus groups (n = 85) explored adults 2 ̆ 7 and children 2 ̆ 7 s reactions when presented with both a FoPL (the Daily Intake Guide, Multiple Traffic Lights, or the Health Star Rating) and a <b>health</b> <b>claim</b> (nutrient content, general-level-, or high-level). A particular focus was participants 2 ̆ 7 processing of discrepant information. Participants reported that <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> {{were more likely to be}} considered during product evaluations if they were perceived to be trustworthy, relevant and informative. Trust and ease of interpretation were most important for FoPLs, which were more likely than <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> to meet criteria and be considered during product evaluation (especially the Health Star Rating and Multiple Traffic Lights). Results indicate that consumers generally find FoPLs more useful than <b>health</b> <b>claims...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects on prices of {{nutrition}} and <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> for foodstuffs, {{in addition to other}} attributes, using fruit beverages as a case study. The model estimation is based on revealed purchasing behaviour for fruit beverages in the north-east of Italy. Applying an hedonic price model, the price of a product is explained as a function of product attributes. The model estimate identifies the implicit retail-market-level price of specific attributes such as nutrition and <b>health</b> <b>claims,</b> ceteris paribus. Nutrition and <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> significantly affect retail prices. Our findings suggest that retail price response to nutrition and <b>health</b> <b>claims</b> differs in relation to other product attributes, showing a strong reduction of price variation among flavours when such benefits are claimed on the label...|$|R
