5|$|Since the anemone lacks a rigid skeleton, the {{contractile}} cells pull {{against the}} fluid in the gastrovascular cavity, forming a hydrostatic skeleton. The anemone stabilizes itself by flattening its pharynx which {{acts as a}} valve, keeping the gastrovascular cavity at a constant volume and making it rigid. When the longitudinal muscles relax, the pharynx opens and the cilia lining the siphonoglyphs beat, wafting water inwards and <b>refilling</b> the gastrovascular cavity. In general, the sea anemone inflates its body to extend its tentacles and feed, and deflates it when resting or disturbed. The inflated body {{is also used to}} anchor the animal inside a crevice, burrow or tube.|$|E

40|$|Capillary <b>refill</b> time (CRT) {{is widely}} {{recommended}} {{as part of}} the routine assessment of sick children. Recent systematic reviews have resulted in better understanding of the validity and diagnostic value of this test. We recommend standardisation of the measurement of capillary <b>refill</b> time.

A prolonged capillary <b>refill</b> time is a specific sign for a range of serious conditions in children, and is appropriate for use as a “red-flag” in primary care.

40|$|PURPOSE: To assess <b>refill</b> {{adherence}} to dispensed oral long-term medications among {{the adult population}} and to investigate whether the percentages of self-reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and sub-therapeutic effects (STEs) differed for medications with adequate <b>refill</b> adherence, oversupply, and undersupply. METHOD: Survey responses on self-reported ADRs and STEs were linked to the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register in a cross-sectional population-based study. <b>Refill</b> {{adherence to}} antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and oral anti-diabetic medications was measured using the continuous measure of medication acquisition (CMA). The percentages of self-reported ADRs and STEs were compared between medications with adequate <b>refill</b> adherence (CMA 0. 8 - 1. 2), oversupply (CMA[*]>[*] 1. 2), and undersupply (CMA[*][*] 0. 5) for ADRs and 1. 1 %, 1. 6 %, and 1. 5 % (p[*]>[*] 0. 5) for STEs. CONCLUSIONS: Adequate <b>refill</b> adherence was found in {{two thirds of the}} medication therapies. ADRs and STEs were unexpectedly equally commonly reported for medications with adequate <b>refill</b> adherence, oversupply, and undersupply. These results suggest that a better understanding of patients' <b>refill</b> behaviors and their perceived medication adverse outcomes is needed and should be considered in improving medication management. The impact of individual and healthcare factors that may influence the association between <b>refill</b> adherence and reported medication adverse outcomes should be investigated in future studies.

40|$|Background: Repeat {{prescribing}} used {{in long-term}} pharmacotherapy is {{often associated with}} inadequate patient medication, including non-adherence. In this paper we explore patients' drug <b>refill</b> adherence with repeat prescriptions and relate <b>refill</b> data to patient age and gender, type of prescriber, type of prescribed drug, and reimbursement level. Methods: During one week of 2002, copies of 3636 repeat prescriptions filled at 16 large Swedish pharmacies were collected. Satisfactory <b>refill</b> adherence was defined as dispensed <b>refills</b> covering 80 - 120 % of the prescribed treatment time. Under- and oversupplying were defined as 120 % coverage, respectively. Result: The average level of <b>refill</b> adherence was 57 %, and the level of under- and oversupplying 21 % and 22 %, respectively. There was no gender difference. Patients who were exempt from payment had higher oversupplies than others (33 % versus 19 %), and patients of general practitioners had higher <b>refill</b> adherence than patients of hospital physicians. The highest <b>refill</b> adherence was observed for contraceptives (81 %) and the lowest for anti-asthmatics, proton pump inhibitors and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (30 - 40 %). Conclusions: <b>Refill</b> non-adherence includes both under- and oversupplying and may vary due to different attitudes between prescribers and between patients. Different therapeutic indications and reimbursement systems are other apparent causes. These observations should be considered in programs aiming to assist patients in following medication prescriptions...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES—Capillary <b>refill</b> time is an {{important}} diagnostic adjunct in the acute resuscitation phase of the shocked child. This study assesses its relation to commonly measured haemodynamic parameters in the postresuscitation phase when the child has reached the intensive care unit, and compares this with core-peripheral temperature gap.  METHODS—Ninety standardised measurements of capillary <b>refill</b> time were made on 55 patients, who were divided into postcardiac surgery (n = 27), and general (n = 28), most of whom had septic shock (n = 24). A normal capillary <b>refill</b> time was defined as ⩽ 2 seconds. Measured haemodynamic variables included: cardiac index, central venous pressure, systemic vascular resistance index, stroke volume index (SVI), and blood lactate. Seventy measurements were made on patients while being treated with inotropes or vasodilators.  RESULTS—Capillary <b>refill</b> time and temperature gap both correlated poorly with all haemodynamic variables among postcardiac surgery children. For general patients, capillary <b>refill</b> time was related to SVI and lactate; temperature gap correlated poorly with all variables. General patients with a prolonged capillary <b>refill</b> time had a lower median SVI (28 v 38 ml/m 2) but not a higher lactate (1. 7 v 1. 1 mmol/l). A capillary <b>refill</b> time of ⩾ 6 seconds had the best predictive value for a reduced SVI.  CONCLUSION—Among ventilated, general intensive care patients, capillary <b>refill</b> time is related weakly to blood lactate and SVI. A normal value for capillary <b>refill</b> time of ⩽ 2 seconds has little predictive value and might be too conservative for this population; septic shock...|$|R

40|$|Background: Online patient portals {{are being}} widely implemented, but {{their impact on}} health {{behaviors}} are not well-studied. Objective: To determine whether statin adherence improved after initiating use of the portal <b>refill</b> function. Research Design: Observational cohort study within an integrated health care delivery system. Subjects: Diabetic patients on statins who had registered for online portal access by 2010. A total of 8705 subjects initiated the online <b>refill</b> function use within the study window, including "exclusive" and "occasional" users (ie, requesting all vs. some <b>refills</b> online, respectively). Usin g risk-set sampling, we temporally matched 9055 reference group patients who never used online <b>refills.</b> Measures: We calculated statin adherence before and after <b>refill</b> function initiation, assessed as percent time without medications (nonadherence defined as a gap of > 20 %). Secondary outcome was dyslipidemia [low-density lipoprotein (LDL) > 100]. Difference-in-differences regression models estimated pre-post changes in nonadherence and dyslipidemia, comparing <b>refill</b> function users to the reference group and adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, medications, frequency of portal use, and outpatient visits. Results: In unadjusted examinations, nonadherence decreased only among patients initiating occasional or exclusive use of the <b>refill</b> function (26 %- 24 % and 22 %- 15 %, respectively). In adjusted models, nonadherence declined by an absolute 6 % (95 % confidence interval, 4 %- 7 %) among exclusive users, without significant changes among occasional users. Similar LDL decreases were also seen among exclusive users. Conclusions: Compared with portal users who did not <b>refill</b> medications online, adherence to statin medications and LDL levels improved among diabetic patients who initiated and exclusively used the patient portal for <b>refills,</b> suggesting that wider adoption of online <b>refills</b> may improve adherence.
