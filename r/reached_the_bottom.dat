5|$|About half-past {{one o'clock}} on the morning, an {{explosion}} {{took place in}} Felling colliery, by which nine men and thirteen boys were hurried into eternity, several others severely burnt, and all the underground horses but one destroyed. The accident occurred {{at the time of}} calling course, or when one set of men were relieving another. Several of the morning shift men were standing round the mouth of the pit, waiting to go down, when the blast occurred, and the part who had just descended met it soon after they had <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the shaft; these were most miserably burnt and mangled.|$|E
5|$|With the {{inclined}} plane, {{the problems}} {{stemmed from a}} mis-calculation. Power was provided by a large tank, filled with water, which descended in a shaft, raising one boat on a trolley and allowing another to descend as it did so. When the tank <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the shaft, the water discharged, and the second tank was used to reverse the process. Green had been the engineer on the Bude Canal, where this design had been used successfully, but {{the size of the}} tanks at Wellisford were much too small. On the Bude Canal, a tank holding 15tons of water was required to raise a boat weighing six tons. The Grand Western Canal used boats holding eight tons, but the tanks only held ten tons of water, whereas tests indicated that about 25tons was needed. It was for this reason that the steam engine was obtained to supply the power.|$|E
5|$|A {{blast furnace}} {{converts}} raw iron ore into pig iron, {{which can be}} remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron. The earliest specimens of cast iron found in China date to the 5th century BC during the late Spring and Autumn period, yet the oldest discovered blast furnaces date to the 3rd century BCE and the majority date to the period after Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BCE) established a government monopoly over the iron industry in 117 BCE (most of the discovered iron works sites built before this date were merely foundries which recast iron that had been smelt elsewhere). Iron ore smelted in blast furnaces during the Han was rarely if ever cast directly into permanent molds; instead, the pig iron scraps were remelted in the cupola furnace to make cast iron. Cupola furnaces utilized a cold blast traveling through tuyere pipes from the bottom and over the top where the charge of charcoal and pig iron was introduced. The air traveling through the tuyere pipes thus became a hot blast once it <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the furnace.|$|E

5|$|Rovers' {{losing streak}} resumed in October {{with a loss}} at league leaders Bury. Tranmere finally scored a goal, which was only their second in seven games, in the League Trophy Second Round clash against Carlisle United. The game went to a shoot-out, won by Rovers 5–4 after Patrick Brough missed the sixth shot for the guests. On 11 October, after fourth {{consecutive}} league defeat at Plymouth Argyle, Tranmere Rovers <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the League Two table with only nine points in 12 games. Two days later manager Rob Edwards had been sacked. On 16 November, ex-Port Vale manager Micky Adams was announced as his replacement, though the team was {{to be prepared for}} the next game by the assistant managers. Adams took charge after a fifth straight league defeat and announced the return to the club of Chris Shuker as assistant manager while Alex Russell left the club. Also, a double loan signing was made in order to strengthen the attack line: Armand Gnanduillet joined from Chesterfield and Danny Johnson signed from Cardiff City, while midfielder Steve Jennings, who was signed by Adams for Port Vale last summer, rejoined him at Tranmere on loan until January.|$|E

25|$|After Titanic, Cameron began {{a project}} that took almost 10 years to make: his science-fiction epic Avatar (2009), which was in {{particular}} a landmark for 3D technology, and for which he received nominations for the same three Academy Awards. Despite Avatar being his only movie made to date in 3D, Cameron is the most successful 3D film-maker in terms of box-office revenue. In the time between making Titanic and Avatar, Cameron spent several years creating many documentary films (specifically underwater documentaries) and co-developed the digital 3D Fusion Camera System.

500|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} the balance, a second chain was fixed {{to the bottom of the}} caisson, so that the total length of chain on each side of the lift remained the same. As a caisson descended, the chain coiled up at the bottom of the lift. The small amount of energy was created by ensuring that the ascending caisson was a little too low by the time the descending one <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom.</b> Thus it would hold a greater depth of water by the time it was ready to descend again.

500|$|The second six {{companies}} landed {{while it}} was still dark, the destroyers coming to within [...] to disembark the troops, under fire. They also landed at Anzac Cove, but now as planned the 11th were in the north, 10th in the centre and the 9th in the south. The 12th Battalion landed all along the beach. This extended the beachhead [...] to the north of Ari Burnu, and [...] to the south. Landing under fire, some of the assaulting troops were killed in their boats, and others as they reached the beach. Once ashore they headed inland.

500|$|Further {{progress}} required apparatus {{which could}} overcome the depth limitation of breathing pure oxygen. In 1955 using an aqualung and swimming with fins, Bob Davies <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the 11th chamber at [...] depth in clear water and discovered the 12th and 13th chambers. Unfortunately, he got {{separated from his}} guideline {{and the other two}} divers in the 11th chamber, ending up spending three hours trapped in the 13th chamber and had much trouble getting back to safety. Opinion hardened against the use of the short-duration aqualung in favour of longer-duration closed-circuit equipment. Likewise, the traditional approach of walking along the bottom was preferred over swimming. Employing semi-closed circuit nitrogen-oxygen rebreathers, between 1957 and 1960 John Buxton and Oliver Wells went on to reach the elbow of the sump upstream from the ninth chamber at a depth of [...] This was at a point known as [...] "The Slot", the way on being too deep for the gas mixture they were breathing.|$|E
500|$|After a {{few days}} delay caused by heavy snowfalls, the attack {{commenced}} at 02:45 on 12 February. During the approach march {{to the foot of}} the Cuklahöhe, some men disappeared up to their neck in snow due to the many snow-filled depressions and the depth of the snow. This meant that the march to the bottom of the channel took two hours instead of the thirty minutes Mikl had estimated. When they <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the channel, they had to climb a [...] high smooth ice wall to enter the gutter, which even highly experienced climbers were unable to scale. Around 06:00, the whole company had assembled at the bottom of the channel, but dawn was beginning to break, threatening to expose the assembled force to flanking Italian positions. Schlatte then came forward, carrying the trunk of an alpenrose, a shrub that grows just above the tree-line in the Alps. He used the trunk to reach the channel ledge, and the troops were able to enter the gutter with his help. The troops could now see the glow of the candles in the Italian position. The assault took the Italians completely by surprise, and three officers and 84 soldiers surrendered, for the loss of four dead, including one officer, and four wounded. The Italian response was to concentrate all available artillery fire on the position. The dugout was exposed to direct Italian fire, and was therefore unusable. The Austrians were in an exposed position in deep snow and with extremely cold winds at an altitude of , and during the first day Mikl's company lost 20 dead and 60 seriously wounded. On the night of 15 February, the Italians commenced two days of unsuccessful counterattacks, some carried out in four or five consecutive waves. For several weeks starting on 17 February, Benito Mussolini, then a member of the Italian 11th Bersaglieri Regiment, was on the front line near the Cuklahöhe, and described some of his experiences in his diary. On 5 March, prior to the withdrawal of his company from the Cuklahöhe, Mikl was wounded in the face by an Italian hand grenade. When his company was relieved on the Cuklahöhe on 12 April, it had shrunk to just 44 men. For his leadership of the assault on the Cuklahöhe, Mikl was awarded the Order of the Iron Crown 3rd Class. On 10 May, the Cuklahöhe was retaken by the Italians from three companies of Bosnian-Herzegovinian Infantry, who lost 250 men. The assault force, consisting of four battalions of the Italian 24th Infantry Division lost 18 officers and 516 men.|$|E
