5|$|Enderlin <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> Leconte and Jeambar in January 2005 in Le Figaro. He thanked {{them for}} rejecting that the scene had been staged. He had {{reported}} that the shots were fired by the Israelis because, he wrote, he trusted the cameraman, {{who had worked for}} France 2 since 1988. In the days following the shooting, other witnesses, including other journalists, offered some confirmation, he said. He added that the Israeli army had not <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> France 2's offers to cooperate with their investigation.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} state governments issued {{requests}} for tender for {{the supply of}} sterile fluids and PD fluids.

5|$|A year later, Manekshaw was {{promoted}} {{to the position of}} army commander and took over Western Command. In 1964, he moved from Shimla to Calcutta as the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) of the Eastern Command. As GOC-in-C Eastern Command, he successfully <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> an insurgency in Nagaland for which he was later awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1968.|$|E

5|$|After lunch, Morris was bowled for 62. Bradman joined Barnes and the Australian skipper {{played and}} missed {{a few times}} before {{settling}} down. Barnes <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> his captain's difficulties by manipulating the strike and shielding Bradman from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the leg trap Bedser set for him, scoring freely into the leg side and taking the shine off the second new ball. Generally however, Barnes also scored sedately after lunch, and after one extended period of defence, he drove Laker for four through the covers, eliciting a round of ironic applause. Barnes <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> the public gallery by placing {{his hand on his}} chest and bowing to the spectators. Barnes had started slowly, but accelerated after reaching his half-century. He reached 96 with Australia at 1/222 half an hour after tea. By this time, the pace of the pitch appeared to have slowed, making batting relatively easy.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{describe}} readers’ reception of story fact elements (character, plot, and setting) in Ayat-Ayat Cinta (AAC). The data sources were reception texts uploaded by readers and were downloaded through Google. The data {{analysis and interpretation}} employed a combination of two perspectives, i. e. text reception and hermeneutics. The findings show that readers <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the elements in the reception with positive and negative tones. In general, however, they <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the elements positively. The characters that most readers <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> are Fahri, Aisha, Maria, and Nurul.

40|$|Should {{monetary}} policy <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> asset prices? This paper analyzes this {{question from the}} vantage point of equilibrium determinacy. A central bank <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> asset prices is indirectly <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> firm profits. In a model with sticky prices, increases in inflation tend to lower firm profits so that a central bank <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> share prices implicitly weakens its overall response to inflation. This is the novel source of equilibrium indeterminacy highlighted in the paper. (Copyright: Elsevier) Monetary policy; Equilibrium determinacy; Interest rate rules...|$|R
