The <b>refractivity</b> <b>profile</b> is modeled using four parameters, i. e., the gradient of the <b>refractivity</b> <b>profile</b> (c 1, c 2) and the vertical altitude (h 1, h 2). We apply the NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), a multiobjective optimization algorithm, to achieve the goals of joint optimization inversion in the inverting process, and compare this method with traditional individual inversion methods. The anti-noise ability of joint inversion is investigated under the noiseless condition and adding noise condition, respectively. The numerical experiments demonstrate that joint inversion is superior to individual inversion. The adding noise test further suggests that this method can estimate synthesized parameters more efficiently and accurately in different conditions. Finally, a set of measured data is tested in the new way and the consequence of inversion shows the joint optimization inversion algorithm has feasibility, effectiveness and superiority in the retrieval of the <b>refractivity</b> <b>profile...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Radar clutter in a {{non-standard}} atmosphere {{usually is}} modeled {{based on a}} single grazing angle at each range. Instead, the angular distribution of incident power {{can be used to}} obtain a more accurate model of the clutter. Angular spectral estima-tion provides the grazing angle distribution of propagating power. However, a large gradient in the <b>refractivity</b> <b>profile,</b> e. g., an evap-oration duct, distorts plane wave propagation which in turn vio-lates assumptions of plane wave spectral estimation. Ray tracing is used in these situations, but has its own limitations (e. g., shadow zones). We suggest using curved wave spectral estimation (CWS) that yields reliable results for any <b>refractivity</b> <b>profile,</b> in contrast to plane wave spectral estimation.

40|$|Horizontal {{refractivity}} gradients in {{the atmosphere}} introduce errors in retrieved profiles from radio oc-cultation measurements. These errors are introduced because the profiles are retrieved using the assump-tion of spherical symmetry and interpreted as verti-cal profiles. However, a more correct interpretation would be {{to think of them}} as a mapping of the two-dimensional structure of the refractivity into a one-dimensional profile. For data assimilation purposes this is an important realization, because error covari-ances may be significantly reduced if the retrieved profiles are interpreted in a way more closely related to {{the manner in which the}} data are obtained and processed. In this paper we assess close to worst-case errors in retrieved <b>refractivity</b> <b>profiles</b> by simulating the occultation measurements in cases where the sig-nals propagate through a model of a weather front, including moisture. The synthetic occultation data are inverted using the assumption of spherical sym-metry to obtain retrieved <b>refractivity</b> <b>profiles.</b> We compare the retrieved <b>refractivity</b> <b>profiles</b> with pro-files obtained from the frontal model in three differ-ent ways: i) refractivity values at the tangent points, ii) refractivity values averaged over 2 ◦ of longitude in the occultation plane, and iii) a mapping of the two-dimensional refractivity field in the occultation plane into a one-dimensional profile. We show that the latter method reduces the errors by about 80 %. Key words: radio occultation, refractivity, horizontal gradients, data assimilation...|$|R

40|$|We {{reconstruct}} atmospheric wet <b>refractivity</b> <b>profiles</b> for {{the western}} part of Switzerland with a least-squares collocation approach from data sets of (a) zenith path delays that are a byproduct of the GPS (global positioning system) processing, (b) ground meteorological measurements, (c) wet <b>refractivity</b> <b>profiles</b> from radio occultations whose tangent points lie within the study area, and (d) radiosonde measurements. Wet refractivity is a parameter partly describing the propagation of electromagnetic waves and depends on the atmospheric parameters temperature and water vapour pressure. In addition, we have measurements of a lower V-band microwave radiometer at Payerne. It delivers temperature profiles at high temporal resolution, especially in the range from ground to 3000 m a. g. l., though vertical information content decreases with height. The temperature profiles together with the collocated wet <b>refractivity</b> <b>profiles</b> provide near-continuous dew point temperature or relative humidity profiles at Payerne for the study period from 2009 to 2011. In the validation of the humidity profiles, we adopt a two-step procedure. We first investigate the reconstruction quality of the wet <b>refractivity</b> <b>profiles</b> at the location of Payerne by comparing them to wet <b>refractivity</b> <b>profiles</b> computed from radiosonde profiles available for that location. We also assess the individual contributions of the data sets to the reconstruction quality and demonstrate a clear benefit from the data combination. Secondly, the accuracy of the conversion from wet refractivity to dew point temperature and relative humidity profiles with the radiometer temperature profiles is examined, comparing them also to radiosonde profiles. For the least-squares collocation solution combining GPS and ground meteorological measurements, we achieve the following error figures with respect to the radiosonde reference: maximum median offset of relative refractivity error is − 16 % and quartiles are 5 % to 40 % for the lower troposphere. We further added 189 radio occultations that met our requirements. They mostly improved the accuracy in the upper troposphere. Maximum median offsets have decreased from 120 % relative error to 44 % at 8 km height. Dew point temperature profiles after the conversion with radiometer temperatures compare to radiosonde profiles as to: absolute dew point temperature errors in the lower troposphere have a maximum median offset of − 2 K and maximum quartiles of 4. 5 K. For relative humidity, we get a maximum mean offset of 7. 3 %, with standard deviations of 12 – 20 %. The methodology presented allows us to reconstruct humidity profiles at any location where temperature profiles, but no atmospheric humidity measurements other than from GPS are available. Additional data sets of wet refractivity are shown to be easily integrated into the framework and strongly aid the reconstruction. Since the used data sets are all operational and available in near-realtime, we envisage the methodology of this paper to be a tool for nowcasting of clouds and rain and to understand processes in the boundary layer and at its top...|$|R

Analysis of the shortening and lengthening of the phase of the Satellite-to-Satellite Tracking (SST) data that passed within 40 - 700 km above the earth's surface during its ATS- 6 to GEOS- 3 to ATS- 6 path, caused by the atmosphere, results in refractivity versus height profiles.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{summarizes}} current {{developments in}} the refractivity from clutter (RFC) techniques and describes the global parametrization approach in estimation of the lower atmospheric electromagnetic sea ducts. RFC uses radar clutter to gather information about the environment the radar is operating in. Range and height dependent atmospheric index of refraction (M-profile) is statistically estimated from the sea-surface reflected radar clutter. These environmental statistics can then be used to predict the radar performance by taking multidimensional integrals of the posterior probability density. All of the following methods use a Bayesian framework and use split-step fast Fourier transform based parabolic equation approximation to the wave equation as the propagation model. Environmental parameters are inverted using genetic algorithms, Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers, and a hybrid genetic algorithm- Markov chain Monte Carlo technique. The methods are compared {{with respect to their}} estimated maximum a posteriori accuracy, speed and ability to sample correctly from posterior density.

40|$|In {{coastal regions}} the {{presence}} of the marine boundary layer can significantly affect RF propagation. The relatively high specific humidity of the underlying "marine layer" creates elevated trapping layers in the radio refractivity structure. While direct sensing techniques provide good data, they are limited in their temporal and spatial scope. There is a need for assessing the three-dimensional (3 -D) time-varying refractivity structure. Recently published results (Gingras et al.

This paper is aimed at precisely quantifying the performance one can expect with matched-field processing methods for remote sensing of the refractivity structure using signal strength measurements from a single emitter to an array of radio receivers. The performance is determined via simulation and is evaluated as a function of: 1) the aperture of the receive array; 2) the <b>refractivity</b> <b>profile</b> model; and 3) the objective function used in the optimization. <b>Refractivity</b> <b>profile</b> estimation results are provided for a surface-based duct example, an elevated duct example, and a sequence of time-varying refractivity profiles.

GNOS was designed for acquiring setting and rising radio occultation (RO) data by using GNSS signals from both the Chinese BeiDou System (BDS) and the U. S. Global Positioning System (GPS). An ultra-stable oscillator with 1 -sec stability (Allan deviation) at the level of 10 − 12 was installed on FY- 3 C GNOS, thus both zero-difference and single-difference excess phase processing methods should be feasible for FY- 3 C GNOS observations. In this study we focus on evaluating zero-difference processing of BDS RO data vs. single-difference processing, in order to investigate the zero-difference feasibility for this new instrument, which after its launch in September 2013 started to use BDS signals from 5 geostationary orbit (GEO) satellites, 5 inclined geosynchronous orbit (IGSO) satellites and 4 medium earth orbit (MEO) satellites. We used a 3 -month set of GNOS BDS RO data (October to December 2013) for the evaluation and compared atmospheric bending angle and <b>refractivity</b> <b>profiles,</b> derived from single- and zero-difference excess phase data, against co-located profiles from ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) analyses. We also compared against co-located <b>refractivity</b> <b>profiles</b> from radiosondes. The statistical evaluation against these reference data shows that the results from single- and zero-difference processing are consistent in both bias and standard deviation, clearly demonstrating the feasibility of zero-differencing for GNOS BDS RO observations. The average bias (and standard deviation) of the bending angle and <b>refractivity</b> <b>profiles</b> were found to be as small as about 0. 05  %– 0. 2  % (and 0. 7  %– 1. 6  %) over the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, including for the GEO, IGSO, and MEO subsets. Zero-differencing was found to perform slightly better, as may be expected from its lower vulnerability to noise.

The impact of the GPS measurement is expressed as an improvement over the a priori knowledge (taken from a 24 h old analysis).

Water vapor improvements are only significant between about 1 km to 7 km. No pronounced difference is found between retrievals based upon bending angles or refractivity. Results are compared to idealized retrievals, where the atmosphere is spherically symmetric and instrument noise is not included. Comparing idealized to quasi-realistic calculations shows that the main impact of a ray tracing algorithm can be expected for low latitude water vapor, where the horizontal variability is high.
