5|$|Some {{species have}} large natural ranges. The eared dove ranges across the {{entirety}} of South America from Colombia to Tierra del Fuego, the Eurasian collared dove has a massive (if discontinuous) distribution from Britain across Europe, the Middle East, India, Pakistan and China, and the laughing dove across most of sub-Saharan Africa, as well as India, Pakistan, and the Middle East. Other species have tiny, restricted distributions; this is most common in island endemics. The whistling dove is endemic to the tiny Kadavu Island in Fiji, the Caroline ground dove is <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> two islands, Truk and Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands, and the Grenada dove is <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> Grenada in the Caribbean. Some continental species also have tiny distributions; for example, the black-banded fruit dove is <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> a small area of the Arnhem Land of Australia, the Somali pigeon is <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> a tiny area of northern Somalia, and Moreno's ground dove is <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> the area around Salta and Tucuman in northern Argentina.|$|E
