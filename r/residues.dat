5|$|A linear {{chain of}} amino acid <b>residues</b> {{is called a}} polypeptide. A protein {{contains}} at least one long polypeptide. Short polypeptides, containing less than 20–30 <b>residues,</b> are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides, or sometimes oligopeptides. The individual amino acid <b>residues</b> are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid <b>residues.</b> The sequence of amino acid <b>residues</b> in a protein {{is defined by the}} sequence of a gene, which is encoded in the genetic code. In general, the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids; however, in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and—in certain archaea—pyrrolysine. Shortly after or even during synthesis, the <b>residues</b> in a protein are often chemically modified by post-translational modification, which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and ultimately, the function of the proteins. Sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors. Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein complexes.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes {{are usually}} {{much larger than}} their substrates. Sizes range from just 62 amino acid <b>residues,</b> for the monomer of 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase, to over 2,500 <b>residues</b> in the animal fatty acid synthase. Only {{a small portion of}} their {{structure}} (around 2–4 amino acids) is directly involved in catalysis: the catalytic site. This catalytic site is located next to one or more binding sites where <b>residues</b> orient the substrates. The catalytic site and binding site together comprise the enzyme's active site. The remaining majority of the enzyme structure serves to maintain the precise orientation and dynamics of the active site.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes {{that contain}} a {{catalytic}} triad {{use it for}} one of two reaction types: either to split a substrate (hydrolases) or to transfer one portion of a substrate over to a second substrate (transferases). Triads are an inter-dependent set of <b>residues</b> in the active site of an enzyme and act in concert with other <b>residues</b> (e.g. binding site and oxyanion hole) to achieve nucleophilic catalysis. These triad <b>residues</b> act together to make the nucleophile member highly reactive, generating a covalent intermediate with the substrate that is then resolved to complete catalysis.|$|E

40|$|Pesticide <b>residue</b> {{assessments}} are conducted to establish legal limits, called Maximum <b>Residue</b> Limits (MRLs). MRLs {{are derived from}} the results of these pesticide <b>residue</b> trials, which are performed according to critical Good Agricultural Practice. Only one <b>residue</b> value per <b>residue</b> trial may be selected for the MRL derivation. Here, a proposal is described for the selection and presentation of <b>residue</b> values in advisory reports, drafted in the Netherlands either by order of the Dutch Board for the Authorisation of Pesticides or the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations. In these advisory reports, <b>residue</b> values from each submitted <b>residue</b> trial are presented in a table. Independent and replicate <b>residue</b> trials are distinguished. <b>Residue</b> trials conducted at the same location and same point in time with the same equipment are considered as one <b>residue</b> trial with several replicates (when the area of application, formulation, dose rate, number of applications and crop variety are the same). For a <b>residue</b> trial consisting of replicate trials, all individual <b>residue</b> values are presented, but only the maximum <b>residue</b> value is selected. Furthermore, one or more field samples can be taken per <b>residue</b> trial and each field sample can be subdivided into one or more laboratory samples, which in turn can be subdivided into one or more analytical portions. For a <b>residue</b> trial consisting of repeated field samples, all individual <b>residue</b> values are presented, but only the mean <b>residue</b> value is selected. Finally, for a <b>residue</b> trial consisting of repeated laboratory samples or repeated analytical portions, only the mean <b>residue</b> values are presented and selected...|$|R

5|$|The {{molecules}} {{bound and}} acted upon by enzymes are called substrates. Although enzymes can consist {{of hundreds of}} amino acids, it is usually {{only a small fraction}} of the <b>residues</b> that come in contact with the substrate, and an even smaller fraction—three to four <b>residues</b> on average—that are directly involved in catalysis. The region of the enzyme that binds the substrate and contains the catalytic <b>residues</b> is known as the active site.|$|E
5|$|The {{sophistication of}} the active site network causes <b>residues</b> {{involved}} in catalysis (and <b>residues</b> in contact with these) to be highly evolutionarily conserved. However, there are examples of divergent evolution in catalytic triads, both in the reaction catalysed, and the <b>residues</b> used in catalysis. The triad remains {{the core of the}} active site, but it is evolutionarily adapted to serve different functions.|$|E
5|$|A {{catalytic}} triad {{refers to}} the three amino acid <b>residues</b> that function together at {{the centre of the}} active site of some hydrolase and transferase enzymes (e.g. proteases, amidases, esterases, acylases, lipases and β-lactamases). An Acid-Base-Nucleophile triad is a common motif for generating a nucleophilic residue for covalent catalysis. The <b>residues</b> form a charge-relay network to polarise and activate the nucleophile, which attacks the substrate, forming a covalent intermediate which is then hydrolysed to regenerate free enzyme and release the product. The nucleophile is most commonly a serine or cysteine amino acid, but occasionally threonine. Because enzymes fold into complex three-dimensional structures, the <b>residues</b> of a catalytic triad can be far from each other along the amino-acid sequence (primary structure), however, they are brought close together in the final fold.|$|E
40|$|Corn <b>residue</b> is {{used for}} forage and feed, but <b>residue</b> removal effects on soil {{properties}} and yield is a concern. <b>Residue</b> removal effects on corn yields and soil organic carbon is site specific. Removing 50 % of the <b>residue</b> from rain fed sites reduced corn yield by 1. 9 bu/ac, whereas removing 40 % of the <b>residue</b> from irrigated sites increased corn yield by 15. 4 bu/ac. However, removing 53 % of the <b>residue</b> increased soil erosion by 30 %. Agronomic practices such as reduced tillage, cover crops, or manure may offset <b>residue</b> removal impacts. <b>Residue</b> removal {{should be based on}} site-specific characteristics and management, but is feasible when sufficient <b>residue</b> is retained to protect soil from erosion and sustain soil biota...|$|R
40|$|Long term {{success of}} {{rehabilitation}} on bauxite-processed <b>residue</b> storage areas is dependant on establishing a capping stratum which will satisfy water use and nutrient cycling {{requirements of the}} intended plant community. Bauxite <b>residue</b> sand is the primary growth media for rehabilitating <b>residue</b> disposal areas (RDAs) in Western Australia however; the sustainability of the vegetation cover can be compromised by the poor water-retention and nutrient cycling properties of the <b>residue</b> sand. This glasshouse {{study was conducted to}} determine if adding untreated or altered <b>residue</b> fines (150 μm) would improve the characteristics of the final storage capping layer for sustained plant growth. <b>Residue</b> sand was amended by adding increments (1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20 % w/w) of untreated or treated (carbonated or seawater washed) <b>residue</b> fines to determine whether these materials affected the chemical and physical properties of the growth media, and their ability to support vegetative growth (Acacia saligna), compared with the current practice of using only <b>residue</b> sand. Addition of <b>residue</b> fines increased water retention and extractable nutrient concentrations relative to untreated <b>residue</b> sand. However, the addition of <b>residue</b> fines increased both the electrical conductivity and exchangeable sodium percentage. Vegetative growth over a 3 -month growing period varied with rate of <b>residue</b> fines addition, and <b>residue</b> fines pre-treatment (seawater > carbonated = unaltered). However, the addition of <b>residue</b> fines did not yield greater growth when compared with unamended <b>residue</b> sand. The importance of differences found in water retention and nutrient concentrations among <b>residue</b> treatments for plant growth need to be investigated in a water-limited field environment...|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} methods to {{calculate}} this carbon <b>residue.</b> It may be expressed as Ramsbottom Carbon <b>Residue</b> (RCR), Conradson Carbon <b>Residue</b> (CCR) or Micro Carbon <b>Residue</b> (MCR). Numerically, the CCR value {{is the same}} as that of MCR.Sometimes the carbon <b>residue</b> value can be listed as Residual Carbon Content, RCC, which is normally the same as MCR/CCR.|$|R
5|$|In 2015 N. Budisa, D. Söll and {{co-workers}} reported the full substitution of all 20,899 tryptophan <b>residues</b> (UGG codons) with unnatural thienopyrrole-alanine in {{the genetic code}} of the bacterium Escherichia coli.|$|E
5|$|The base is most {{commonly}} histidine since its pKa allows for effective base catalysis, hydrogen bonding to the acid residue, and deprotonation of the nucleophile residue. β-lactamases such as TEM-1 use a lysine residue as the base. Because lysine's pKa {{is so high}} (pKa=11), a glutamate and several other <b>residues</b> act as the acid to stabilise its deprotonated state during the catalytic cycle. Threonine proteases use their N-terminal amide as the base, since steric crowding by the catalytic threonine's methyl prevents other <b>residues</b> from being close enough.|$|E
5|$|The {{enzymology}} of proteases {{provides some}} of the clearest known examples of convergent evolution. The same geometric arrangement of triad <b>residues</b> occurs in over 20 separate enzyme superfamilies. Each of these superfamilies is the result of convergent evolution for the same triad arrangement within a different structural fold. This is because there are limited productive ways to arrange three triad <b>residues,</b> the enzyme backbone and the substrate. These examples reflect the intrinsic chemical and physical constraints on enzymes, leading evolution to repeatedly and independently converge on equivalent solutions.|$|E
40|$|Following harvest, {{agricultural}} {{fields are}} left with varying amounts of crop <b>residue</b> cover. The erodibility and health of the topsoil is determined, in part, by the amount and type of this <b>residue</b> cover. Although radar sensors could be useful for mapping <b>residue</b> and/or tillage in order to monitor soil conservation practices, little is understood {{about the relationship between}} <b>residue</b> and radar backscatter. Two ground-based microwave scatterometer experiments were conducted on agricultural plots at the Central Experimental Farm of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, in Ottawa (Canada). The experiments were designed to address the influence of <b>residue</b> type (corn and barley), <b>residue</b> moisture content and <b>residue</b> amount on radar backscatter, and to examine the effect of look direction on radar response. Scatterometer measurements (C- and L-Band in four linear transmit-receive polarization combinations) were taken of corn and barley plots where treatments varied in <b>residue</b> amount and moisture level. The experiments demonstrated that crop <b>residue</b> can retain significant amounts of moisture and that <b>residue</b> is not transparent to incident microwaves. <b>Residue</b> cover will impede the use of radar sensors for mapping soil moisture. Both <b>residue</b> amount and <b>residue</b> moisture content were correlated with radar backscatter, with the strongest correlations associated with corn <b>residue</b> treatments, C-Band cross-polarized backscatter and shallow incidence angles. Cross-polarized scattering was not sensitive to radar look direction effects...|$|R
40|$|Direct seeding {{in fields}} with high amounts of <b>residue</b> {{has always been}} a problem for producers. Excess <b>residue</b> causes hair-pining of the straw which results in {{decreased}} penetration of disk openers. Hair-pinning also results in poor seed placement which decreases the crop establishment. In the past, <b>residue</b> managers have commonly been used in the United States to clear <b>residue</b> for precision planters in high value crops. The precision planter <b>residue</b> managers are costly and therefore are not commonly used to seed other types of crops. Manufacturers have recently designed universal cheaper types of <b>residue</b> managers. The new <b>residue</b> managers are designed for cereal, pulse and oilseed type crops to clear the <b>residue</b> away from the path of the opener to allow for good soil penetration, <b>residue</b> clearance and seed placement. The AgTech Centre was approached by the Alberta Reduced Tillage Linkages (ARTL) to test the performance of several different <b>residue</b> managers. The ARTL wanted to increase the exposure of <b>residue</b> managers in Alberta with hopes of more producers direct seeding in heavy <b>residue</b> conditions. The AgTech Centre performed an experiment to test various types of <b>residue</b> managers while seeding with disk openers under different conditions. Measurements were made and analyzed. <b>Residue</b> managers did increase the crop emergence of wheat and canola but results were not significant. Further testing and data is needed to conclude the study...|$|R

5|$|The {{mechanism}} of proteolysis by the β subunits of the 20S core particle {{is through a}} threonine-dependent nucleophilic attack. This mechanism may depend on an associated water molecule for deprotonation of the reactive threonine hydroxyl. Degradation occurs within the central chamber formed by the association of the two β rings and normally does not release partially degraded products, instead reducing the substrate to short polypeptides typically 7–9 <b>residues</b> long, though they can range from 4 to 25 <b>residues,</b> depending on the organism and substrate. The biochemical mechanism that determines product length is not fully characterized. Although the three catalytic β subunits have a common mechanism, they have slightly different substrate specificities, which are considered chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidyl-glutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing (PHGH)-like. These variations in specificity {{are the result of}} interatomic contacts with local <b>residues</b> near the active sites of each subunit. Each catalytic β subunit also possesses a conserved lysine residue required for proteolysis.|$|E
