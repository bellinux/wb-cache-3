500|$|While {{promoting}} 2014's The Endless River, Nick Mason named A Saucerful of Secrets as his favourite of Pink Floyd's studio albums. “I {{think there}} are ideas contained there that we have continued to use {{all the way through}} our career,” he says. “I think [...] was a quite good way of marking Syd ’s departure and Dave ’s arrival. It’s <b>rather</b> <b>nice</b> to have it on one record, where you get both things. It’s a cross-fade rather than a cut.” ...|$|E
500|$|After the WaveAid concert, {{from early}} 2005, Powderfinger had {{a period of}} hiatus. During the separation, most band members pursued other musical projects; on the {{personal}} front, Haug and Middleton each had children, and Fanning met his future wife. Middleton's side project, Drag, had issued an EP, Gas Food Lodging, in 2002. Zombos Reviews found the EP was [...] "full of well-written jangly pop, and has some <b>rather</b> <b>nice</b> ballads". Their debut album, The Way Out, recorded in March 2005 and released on 10 July, was [...] "a tad disappointing ... mostly mid-tempo pop-rock songs, mixed with some slower, pretty ballads. Everything's tastefully arranged, and there's always nice melodies and harmonies". Collins and Haug formed The Predators with Powderfinger's former drummer, Steven Bishop, now on drums and lead vocals. The group released a six-track EP, Pick Up the Pace, in July 2006 and undertook a short tour around Australia.|$|E
500|$|Schaffner {{recalled}} that Cooper appeared {{familiar with the}} local terrain; {{at one point he}} remarked, [...] "Looks like Tacoma down there," [...] as the aircraft flew above it. He also correctly mentioned that McChord Air Force Base was only a 20-minute drive (at that time) from Seattle-Tacoma Airport. Schaffner described him as calm, polite, and well-spoken, not at all consistent with the stereotypes (enraged, hardened criminals or [...] "take-me-to-Cuba" [...] political dissidents) popularly associated with air piracy at the time. Tina Mucklow, another flight attendant, agreed. [...] "He wasn't nervous," [...] she told investigators. [...] "He seemed <b>rather</b> <b>nice.</b> He was never cruel or nasty. He was thoughtful and calm all the time." [...] He ordered a second bourbon and water, paid his drink tab (and attempted to give Schaffner the change), and offered to request meals for the flight crew during the stop in Seattle.|$|E

500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, enjoyed the episode, commenting: [...] "A case perhaps of life {{reflecting}} art as guest star Helen Hunt is now married to Hank Azaria, who is, of course, Moe, which is <b>rather</b> <b>nice</b> as you can't help but feel sad that, {{by the end of}} this rather clever and charming episode, Moe has been unlucky in love once more." [...] In a 2006 article in USA Today, [...] "Dumbbell Indemnity" [...] was highlighted among the six best episodes of The Simpsons season 9, along with [...] "Trash of the Titans", [...] "The Last Temptation of Krust", [...] "The Cartridge Family", [...] "The Joy of Sect", and [...] "Das Bus". IGN ranked Hail to the Chimp, the film Homer goes to see in the episode, as the seventh best fictional film within another work. Show runner Mike Scully greatly enjoyed the scene where Homer attempts to escape Moe's car when it is going down the cliff, and has said that it is one of his favorite scenes from the show.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} case, [...] is jointly unsatisfiable {{and in the}} second the case the leaf node of the open branch gives an {{assignment}} to the atomic formulae and negated atomic formulae which makes [...] jointly satisfiable. Classical logic actually has the <b>rather</b> <b>nice</b> property that we need to investigate only (any) one tableau completely: if it closes then [...] is unsatisfiable and if it is open then [...] is satisfiable. But this property is not generally enjoyed by other logics.|$|E

6000|$|... "It is <b>rather</b> a <b>nice</b> point," [...] he said. [...] "It {{might be}} claimed that I {{appointed}} myself. You may say, however, that Comrade Windsor appointed me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{that young}} sprig of fashion, Lord Felixstowe," [...] Jacob replied. [...] "I haven't {{heard from him}} yet. He is <b>rather</b> a <b>nice</b> boy. And there is Miss Bultiwell herself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aunt Myra says I have no constitution, {{and never}} shall be strong," [...] {{observed}} Rose, in a pensive tone, {{as if it}} was <b>rather</b> a <b>nice</b> thing to be an invalid.|$|R
60|$|LADY CHESHIRE. The {{girls like}} her, so does your father; {{personally}} I must say I think she's <b>rather</b> <b>nice</b> and Irish.|$|E
60|$|MISS LORE (wisely)--Well, {{if he had}} {{the twenty}} that he {{believed}} he had, it might buy her a <b>rather</b> <b>nice</b> one.|$|E
60|$|Reginald {{closed his}} eyes with the {{elaborate}} weariness of one who has <b>rather</b> <b>nice</b> eyelashes and thinks it useless to conceal the fact.|$|E
60|$|Boulter, who had {{the matter}} in hand, Jobling having died some years before, told him that in his opinion it was <b>rather</b> a <b>nice</b> point; he would like counsel's opinion on it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it?" [...] said Cornelia, not so {{much with}} preoccupation, perhaps, as with indifference. She thought it <b>rather</b> a <b>nice</b> name, {{but she did not}} know what she had to do with it.|$|R
60|$|Thereupon he plunged in his hands, {{and they}} paddled together. It {{being the first}} time in his life that he had touched female fingers under water, Dick duly {{registered}} the sensation as <b>rather</b> a <b>nice</b> one.|$|R
6000|$|She {{stared down}} at the picture interestedly, forgetting him, {{pinching}} her chin thoughtfully, while she murmured: [...] "They're <b>rather</b> <b>nice.</b> Rather good. Rather good." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him again. She had <b>rather</b> <b>nice</b> eyes, quite dark and very soft, {{and she was a}} great believer in their efficacy.|$|E
6000|$|She {{took the}} curiously-decorated box {{he gave her}} and broke the seal. [...] "Since you don't smoke these things, Tom, you were <b>rather</b> <b>nice</b> to remember." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, {{we do have}} <b>rather</b> a <b>nice</b> collection; but you haven't {{seen the}} best of all. We expect her every minute; and Margery Daw is {{to let us know}} the minute she lights on the island," [...] replied Peter, with his mouth full.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I am so {{glad you}} admire it. I think it is <b>rather</b> a <b>nice</b> dress, but then I always say that nobody in London can make a dress like Madame Jules. Oh, no, Geoffrey did not choose it; he thinks of other things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's the top {{and bottom}} of it," [...] he laughed, flushed with wine, and handsome. We're all as right as ninepence. Only it's <b>rather</b> <b>nice</b> to talk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it's a very proper {{feeling and}} you're <b>rather</b> <b>nice.</b> But {{you talked about}} {{going to see the}} {{mountains}} for a few days. When do you start?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{was looking}} <b>rather</b> <b>nice.</b> She {{had a very}} smart hat on {{with a lot of}} white ostrich {{feathers}} on it. She must be doing pretty well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That'll be <b>rather</b> a <b>nice</b> cottage when it's launched," [...] {{said the}} Captain, {{pointing}} to a building in process of erection, which stood {{so close to the}} edge of the Thames that its being launched seemed as much a literal allusion as a metaphor.|$|R
5000|$|But {{perhaps more}} startling, and disturbing, was the {{tendency}} for aggression and violence within chimpanzee troops. Goodall observed dominant females deliberately killing the young of other females in the troop {{in order to maintain}} their dominance, sometimes going so far as cannibalism. [...] She says of this revelation, “During the first ten years of the study I had believed … that the Gombe chimpanzees were, for the most part, <b>rather</b> <b>nicer</b> than human beings. … Then suddenly we found that chimpanzees could be brutal—that they, like us, had a darker side to their nature.” These findings revolutionized contemporary knowledge of chimpanzee diet and feeding behaviors, and were further evidence of the social similarities between humans and chimpanzees, albeit in a much darker manner.|$|R

6000|$|Halson looked down, {{and then}} he glanced at Minver after a furtive passage of his eye over Rulledge's intense face. [...] "There was {{something}} <b>rather</b> <b>nice</b> happened after--But, really, now!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{know the}} place," [...] said Miss Mohun. [...] "Strange to say, it {{produces}} <b>rather</b> a <b>nice</b> girl, under the compulsion {{of the school}} officer.

6000|$|But Kipps {{lay awake}} {{for a long}} while {{building}} his house, and in the morning at breakfast he made his meaning clear.

6000|$|... "Ah, well!" [...] she said, [...] "I don't want to dishearten you, {{only you}} seem <b>rather</b> a <b>nice</b> little thing, and I am afraid you don't quite {{understand}} {{the sort of}} man my father is. However, you'll find out, and until you do I should have as good a time as I could if I were you. How do you like New York?" ...|$|R
