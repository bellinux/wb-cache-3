The discussion arises from an attempt {{to move beyond the}} use of technology as an alternative publication tool, or as an adjunct to distance education or asynchronous learning, and looks at the issues that arose in an attempt to use technology to introduce new ways of teaching and learning. The aim was to introduce e-learning as a personal experience as well as a methodology for future use. The many issues encompass the teaching strategies used; the implications for resourcing and managing the resources, hardware and software; the licensing of software; the new demands on the library for managing CD-ROM materials and providing access for reviewing <b>restricted</b> <b>loan</b> materials; ease of access for students of both hardware and software; compatibility with home computers; the technical support required from systems/program writers and the hours of brainstorming possibilities and ways and means. Within the context of preparing the student teachers to teach literacy and English it meant teaching them to teach in ways that we ourselves have not taught; to introduce them to the distinctive literacy skills required for the use of e-learning, including the critical literacy necessary for the thoughtful use of electronic information sources; to challenge them to explore the use of e-learning approaches in their lesson preparation, and to be informed about the programs and resources available for their use in the classroom...|$|E

This credit position resulted both from foreign direct investment by Japanese corporations, and portfolio investment (holdings of foreign exchange by the central government).

Yet recently microcredit programs, such as the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, have become popular among donors and governments as a way to channel funds to the poor. This paper uses a unique panel dataset from two Bangladeshi villages to test if the modern microcredit movement is different from its predecessors. Poverty is measured by levels of consumption. Vulnerability is measured as fluctuations in consumption associated with inefficient risk sharing. We find that subsidized credit is largely successful at reaching the poor and vulnerable. The probability that a microcredit member is below the poverty line is substantially higher than that of a randomly picked household in both villages. In the village where female headed households were found to be vulnerable, nearly half of the female headed households belonged to microcredit programs yet only a quarter of male headed households were microcredit members.

40|$|Threadneedle is a multi-agent {{simulation}} framework, {{based on}} a full double entry book keeping implementation of the banking system's fundamental transactions. It is designed {{to serve as an}} experimental test bed for economic simulations that can explore the banking system's influence on the macro-economy under varying assumptions for its regulatory framework, mix of financial instruments, and activities of borrowers and lenders. Support is provided for Basel Capital and central bank reserve regulatory frameworks, inter-bank lending and correct handling of loan defaults within the bank accounting framework. In this paper we provide an overview of the design of Threadneedle, and the rational for the double entry book keeping approach used in its implementation. We then provide evidence from a series of experiments using the simulation that the macro-economic behaviour of the banking system is in some cases sensitive to double entry book keeping ledger definitions, and in particular that loss provisions can be systemically affecting. We also show that credit and money expansion in Basel regulated systems is now dominated by the Basel capital requirements, rather than the older central bank reserve requirements. This implies that bank profitability is now the main factor in providing new capital to support lending, meaning that lowering interest rates can act to <b>restrict</b> <b>loan</b> supply, rather than increasing borrowing as currently believed. We also show that long term liquidity flows due to interest repayment act in favour of the bank making the loan, and do not provide any long term throttling effect on loan expansion and money expansion as has been claimed by Keynes and others.

40|$|In early 2008 {{the federal}} {{government}} instructed the Productivity Commission (PC) to enquire into {{the social and economic}} policy issue of paid parental leave (PPL). In their draft report, the PC (2008) has called for a taxpayer funded scheme of 18 weeks duration, despite Australian governments having so far resisted the introduction of a broad grants-based system. A case for government subsidy of PPL can be made on the basis that the social benefits exceed the advantages accruing directly to families. However, as there are also indisputable private benefits accruing to the parents taking leave, there is a case for private contributions. We identify a market failure in that commercial banks will not provide funds in the absence of collateral due to repayment uncertainty during parental leave, a situation quite similar to the market failure inherent with respect to the financing of tuition for higher education (Gans, 2008). To address this financing impasse, we consider how an income contingent loan (ICL) could be used as an optional supplement to a taxpayer funded PPL scheme. Moral hazard and adverse selection are critical policy issues and these are addressed in the scheme design by: <b>restricting</b> <b>loan</b> duration and size; restricting eligibility to parents with workforce attachment; reducing minimum repayment thresholds to below those of HECS; imposing a loan surcharge, and; making the debt an obligation of both parents. We explain and present simulations of debt, repayment and subsidies for different households. The results show that an optional top-up ICL would not require major contributions from taxpayers, yet would introduce flexibility and choice, and provide consumption-smoothing and lifetime income distribution advantages over possible alternatives. paid parental leave; income contingent loans; public policy; industrial relations...|$|R

50|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 33AD is largely {{considered to be}} caused by credit easing policies that Tiberius took in order to limit the Aristocrats' wealth and land-ownership, and done in response to Augustus's massive private and public expenditures. Prior to 33AD, Augustus engaged in lavish spending in the public and private sector, while greatly encouraging land ownership and investment in real estate. Augustus thought that all citizens should have access to land and money. As a result, he aggressively engaged in a massive extension of credit into the real estate and public sector, and engaged in riskier and riskier loans. Due to his policies, land and real estate prices rose dramatically, benefitting his wealthy and noble land-owner friends who owned large amounts of property and invested heavily in real estate. Tiberius noticed such collusion, and looked to curb the amount of land that the wealthy and elites owned, as well as control the rapidly inflating money supply. He engaged in heavy austerity policies such as ordering for all loans be paid off immediately, and began confiscating property from the wealthy land-owners, in what is now known as monetary easing. By <b>restricting</b> <b>loans</b> for land purchasing, and the demand to pay loans in full, debtors were forced to sell off their property and real estate, which drastically dropped real estate and land prices. Paired with Tiberius' credit easing policy and the Senate naively demanding that people continue to invest in land despite what was going on, massive deflation occurred which ultimately cause the market to collapse. This {{financial crisis}} and Tiberius' engagement in Quantitative easing is one of the earliest records of monetary policy being used to adjust economic conditions.
