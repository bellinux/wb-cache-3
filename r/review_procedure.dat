5|$|However, Graham {{suggests}} that Lord Steyn's comments {{were limited to}} the use of the Parliament Acts and would not apply to legislation enacted using the ordinary legislative procedure. He also argues that it would be difficult to explain how courts would refuse to apply legislation unless human rights were involved, citing the example of the removal of judicial review: using fundamental common law principles to interpret legislation is very different from striking down legislation supported by the elected House of Commons, and would be even more contentious if the legislation only substantially modified judicial <b>review</b> <b>procedure.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Judge Sam Sparks {{issued a}} {{preliminary}} injunction barring {{the city from}} enforcing the ordinance after finding it imposed a higher fine than state law allowed and lacking in a <b>review</b> <b>procedure.</b> Between that time and trial a year later, the city issued several sets of guidelines on the [...] "necessary steps" [...] a business must take to prevent smoking within its premises, a phrase which had been attacked by the plaintiffs as particularly vague.

2500|$|Most pits {{proposed}} for closure in 1981 were closed {{on a case-by-case}} basis by the colliery <b>review</b> <b>procedure,</b> and the NCB cut employment by 41,000 between March 1981 and March 1984. [...] The effect of closures was lessened by transfers to other pits and the opening up of the Selby Coalfield where working conditions and wages were relatively favourable. [...] Localised strikes occurred at Kinneil Colliery in Scotland and Lewis Merthyr Colliery in Wales. [...] The industry's Select Committee heard that 36,040 of the 39,685 redundancies between 1973 and 1982 were of men aged 55 and over, and redundancy pay was increased substantially in 1981 and 1983.|$|E

2500|$|In April 1984, NACODS {{voted to}} strike but was {{short of the}} two-thirds {{majority}} that their constitution required. In areas where the strike was observed, most NACODS members did not cross picket lines and, under an agreement from the 1972 strike, stayed off work on full pay. [...] When the number of strikebreakers increased in August, Merrick Spanton, the NCB personnel director, said he expected NACODS members to cross picket lines to supervise their work threatening the 1972 agreement {{which led to a}} second ballot. Ian MacGregor suggested that deputies could be replaced by outsiders as Ronald Reagan had done during the 1981 airline strike. In September, for the first time, NACODS voted to strike with a vote of 81% in favour. The government then made concessions over the <b>review</b> <b>procedure</b> for unprofitable collieries, much to the anger of Ian MacGregor, and a deal negotiated by North Yorkshire NCB Director Michael Eaton persuaded NACODS to call off the strike action.|$|E
2500|$|In Cinpres Gas Injection Ltd v Melea Ltd, an {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt was made}} to resurrect the supplemental bill of review. [...] Jacob LJ, giving the judgement of the Court of Appeal, held that an attempt to invoke the old bill of review could not succeed because, for generations, applications for rehearing on the basis of fresh evidence had been made to the Court of Appeal and, if the bill of <b>review</b> <b>procedure</b> had survived the Judicature Acts, it had long since lapsed. The judge observed that [...] "it would make for better justice in principle for a prior decision to be impugnable on the grounds for which a bill of review once lay, namely that there was fresh evidence not discoverable by reasonable diligence, which 'entirely changes the aspect of the case,'" [...] (para. [...] ). However, he also observed that the Court of Appeal had not been asked to consider its powers under CPR 52.17 to re-open a final appeal in [...] "exceptional circumstances" [...] and therefore could not say whether such an application would have succeeded.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study is to open up the black box of peer review and to {{increase}} its transparency, understanding, and credibility. To this end, two arguments will be presented: First, epistemic and social aspects of peer <b>review</b> <b>procedures</b> are inseparable and mutually constitutive. Second, a content analysis of written reviews indicates that certain elements of peer culture from the 17 th century are still active in the scientific community. These arguments are illustrated by a case study on the peer review practices of a national funding institution, the Swiss National Science Foundation. Based on the case study and the two arguments it will be concluded more generally that peer <b>review</b> <b>procedures</b> show a distinctive specificity to the reviewed objects (e. g. papers or proposals), the organisational format (e. g. panels or external reviewers), or the surrounding context (e. g. disciplinary or interdisciplinary). Scientists, administrators, and the public may conclude that appraising peer <b>review</b> <b>procedures</b> should not be done by way of general principals but should be based on concrete factual knowledge on the specific process under discussion...|$|R
