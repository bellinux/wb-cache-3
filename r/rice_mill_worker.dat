40|$|Abstract: There {{are many}} <b>rice</b> <b>mills</b> and food grain depots where {{a large number}} of workers are engaged for {{processing}} paddy and rice, storage and distribution. Lifting, carrying and depositing sacs of food grain are the major jobs carried out by these workers. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the workers with respect to their nutritional status, workload, energy expenditure and musculoskeletal pain or discomfort resulting out of work practice. Average peak heart rate of the depot and <b>rice</b> <b>mill</b> <b>workers</b> suggested the workload as moderate to very heavy. Their average energy expenditure values also indicated the workload as moderate to heavy. Subjective assessment of the workers showed the workload as heavy for 60. 7 % depot workers and 23. 1 % <b>rice</b> <b>mill</b> <b>workers.</b> Musculoskeletal pain or discomfort was maximally reported in knee by 59 % depot workers whereas low back and knee was reported by 61. 5 % <b>rice</b> <b>mill</b> <b>workers.</b> Besides the weight of the sac, awkward postures like bending and twisting of trunk adopted frequently causes the problem.

40|$|Background: There {{are several}} occupations where {{individuals}} {{are exposed to}} high concentration of dust particles. The exposed dust can be organic, inorganic, bacterial toxins, viruses or lipopolysaccharides. Exposure to rice husk causes activation of eosinophils and inammation reactions. Cardiovascular diseases are associated with increased lipid peroxidation and decrease in levels of antioxidants. Aim & Objectives: Aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the effect of occupational exposure on haematological and biochemical parameters of <b>rice</b> <b>mill</b> <b>workers</b> by analyzing blood cell Counts, Malondialdehyde (MDA), Nitric Oxide (NO) and Ascorbic acid. Material and Methods: A total of 134 eligible individuals who had been exposed to dust in <b>rice</b> <b>mills</b> for more than 5 years were included in the study group where as another 134 unexposed individuals constituted control group.

Disamping efek negatifnya terhadap fungsi pendengaran, paparan bising diperkirakan mempunyai pengaruh fisiologis. Efek fisiologis non-auditory dad paparan bising adalah kenaikan tekanan darah. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah menganalisa pengaruh pemakaian earplug terhadap tekanan darah akibat paparan bising. Penelitian ini dilakukan pada 30 pekerja penggilingan padi yang telah memenuhi kriteria inklusi dan eksklusi yang ditetapkan. Jenis penelitian ini termasuk eksperimen semu dengan rancangan pretest-postest group design. Pada penelitian ini menggunakan subyek (pekerja) yang sama sebagai unit analisisnya, dimana tekanan darah pekerja dibandingkan ketika tidak memakai earplug dan ketika memakai earplug. Pengukuran tekanan darah dilakukan sebelum dan setelah bekerja baik pada saat memakai ataupun tidak memakai earplug. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa intensitas kebisingan berada diatas NAB di semua penggilingan padi. Dad uji pairedt t-test didapatkan bahwa terdapat perbedaan rata-rata tekanan darah pekerja antara ketika memakai earplug dengan tidak memakai earplug Tekanan darah pekerja ketika memakai earplug lebih rendah 14 / 6 mmHg daripada ketika tidak memakai earplug.
