5|$|A 2011 {{study by}} Walk Score ranked Denver sixteenth most {{walkable}} of fifty largest U.S. cities, though massive {{gaps in the}} cities sidewalks <b>remain</b> <b>an</b> oft-discussed issue. Many walkability advocates believe the city's need for pedestrian infrastructure is only growing as Denver and the Colorado Department of Transportation place the needs of cars over the needs of people by widening roads or the purposeful plowing of snow onto sidewalks during winter storms.|$|E
5|$|Electricity is used within telecommunications, {{and indeed}} the {{electrical}} telegraph, demonstrated commercially in 1837 by Cooke and Wheatstone, was one of its earliest applications. With the construction of first intercontinental, and then transatlantic, telegraph systems in the 1860s, electricity had enabled communications in minutes across the globe. Optical fibre and satellite communication have taken {{a share of the}} market for communications systems, but electricity can be expected to <b>remain</b> <b>an</b> essential part of the process.|$|E

5|$|Fired bricks {{were being}} used to build durable masonry across Europe, Asia and North Africa by 1200 BC and still <b>remain</b> <b>an</b> {{important}} building material. Modern fired clay bricks are formed from clays or shales, shaped and then fired in a kiln for 8–12 hours at a temperature of 900–1150°C.|$|E
5|$|Greenhouses convert solar {{light to}} heat, {{enabling}} year-round {{production and the}} growth (in enclosed environments) of specialty crops and other plants not naturally suited to the local climate. Primitive greenhouses were first used during Roman times to produce cucumbers year-round for the Roman emperor Tiberius. The first modern greenhouses were built in Europe in the 16th century to keep exotic plants brought back from explorations abroad. Greenhouses <b>remain</b> <b>an</b> important part of horticulture today, and plastic transparent materials have also been used to similar effect in polytunnels and row covers.|$|E

5|$|The Tudor era saw {{prominent}} {{artists as}} part of their court, portrait painting which would <b>remain</b> <b>an</b> enduring part of English art, was boosted by German Hans Holbein, natives such as Nicholas Hilliard built on this. Under the Stuarts, Continental artists were influential especially the Flemish, examples from the period include—Anthony van Dyck, Peter Lely, Godfrey Kneller and William Dobson. The 18th century was a time of significance with the founding of the Royal Academy, a classicism based on the High Renaissance prevailed—Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds became two of England's most treasured artists.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{felt the}} contractors could not complete {{the program and}} instructed them to repay most of the $2 billion that had been spent on A-12 development. McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics disputed this in Federal Claims court. The reasons and causes for the cancellation have been debated and <b>remain</b> <b>an</b> issue of controversy, with suggestions of political expediency and scheming to be behind the action.|$|E
5|$|With urbanisation, {{distinctive}} urban accents {{have arisen}} which often differ greatly from the historical accents {{of the surrounding}} rural areas and sometimes share features with Southern English accents. Northern English dialects <b>remain</b> <b>an</b> {{important part of the}} culture of the region, and the desire of speakers to assert their local identity has led to accents such as Scouse and Geordie becoming more distinctive and spreading into surrounding areas.|$|E

5|$|Among the Fundamental Truths was a {{statement}} regarding speaking in tongues as the initial physical evidence of Spirit baptism. Its inclusion was challenged by F.F. Bosworth, an executive presbyter, who argued that while for many speaking in tongues was an evidence of the baptism {{it was not the}} only evidence. The issue was decided at the General Council of September 1918 where Bosworth, who two months earlier had resigned so as not to damage the fellowship, was present and invited to address the council. Following debate two resolutions were passed which assured that initial evidence would <b>remain</b> <b>an</b> official teaching of the fellowship.|$|E
5|$|As such, {{the role}} of the Army Reserve now {{encompasses}} the '3 Rs'—that is reinforcement, round-out and rotation. With a total strength in 2005–06 of just 15,579 active personnel, recruitment and retention <b>remain</b> <b>an</b> ongoing issue for Defence planners, nevertheless Reservists continue to have a high training obligation. Since September 2006, in an incentive to rectify sliding retention rates, Reservist salaries have been streamlined with those of regular forces as a reflection of overall higher standard of training. This initiative shows that in recent decades, there are now many positions for which there is little training gap at all between Reservists and Permanent Force members. In 2008–09 total strength included 17,064 active personnel. In addition there were another 12,496 members of the Standby Reserve.|$|E
5|$|From {{the five}} on the shortlist, two sites were considered, the Cathays Park Building and Cardiff City Hall. Cardiff City Hall was favoured because the {{executive}} and legislative functions would be separated, Cardiff City Hall was more widely recognised by the Welsh public and was a more prestigious building compared with the Cathays Park Building. The move to Cardiff City Hall would have also avoided a disruptive move for Welsh Office staff at the Cathays Park Building. The Welsh Office concluded that Cardiff City Hall would only <b>remain</b> <b>an</b> option if the initial costs were £17M or less, which was the top end of the estimate figure given in the white paper. This would only be possible if essential works were carried out immediately and {{the remainder of the}} work carried out later. Cardiff Council would need to agree a selling price of £5M or less for this to be possible.|$|E

5|$|Gangtok rose to {{prominence}} {{as a popular}} Buddhist pilgrimage site after {{the construction of the}} Enchey Monastery in 1840. In 1894, the ruling Sikkimese Chogyal, Thutob Namgyal, transferred the capital to Gangtok. In the early 20th century, Gangtok became a major stopover on the trade route between Lhasa in Tibet and cities such as Kolkata (then Calcutta) in British India. After India won its independence from Britain in 1947, Sikkim chose to <b>remain</b> <b>an</b> independent monarchy, with Gangtok as its capital. In 1975, after the integration with the union of India, Gangtok was made India's 22nd state capital.|$|E

5|$|In southeastern Anatolia, the Ayyubids {{continued}} {{to rule the}} principality of Hisn Kayfa and managed to <b>remain</b> <b>an</b> autonomous entity, independent of the Mongol Ilkhanate, which ruled northern Mesopotamia until the 1330s. After {{the breakup of the}} Ilkhanate, their former vassals in the area, the Artuqids, waged war against the Ayyubids of Hisn Kayfa in 1334, but were decisively defeated, with the Ayyubids gaining the Artuqids' possessions on the left bank of the Tigris River. In the 14th century, the Ayyubids rebuilt the castle of Hisn Kayfa which served as their stronghold. The Ayyubids of Hisn Kayfa were vassals of the Mamluks and later the Dulkadirids until being supplanted by the Ottoman Empire in the early 16th century.|$|E

5|$|It {{was against}} this {{backdrop}} that the Canadian Lady Corset Company had to act. In 1964, Moe Nadler died and his son, Larry Nadler inherited control of the company. Larry Nadler was a Harvard-trained MBA and brought modern marketing strategies to the industry. He commissioned market research that identified women's feelings about intimate apparel. Women did not hate their bras. Rather, they saw bras {{as a means to}} feel and look beautiful, to be fashionable and sexy, and to attract men. While women sometimes went braless, they were making a fashion choice and not a political statement. Canadian Lady's management knew that girdles were out, but bras would <b>remain</b> <b>an</b> essential part of women's wardrobes. So during the 1960s, while competitors were cutting back on their bra marketing and diversifying into other products, Canadian Lady aggressively pursued bra market share.|$|E
5|$|Pitt became Prime Minister in December 1783, with Wilberforce a key {{supporter}} of his minority government. Despite their close friendship, {{there is no}} record that Pitt offered Wilberforce a ministerial position in this or future governments. This may have been due to Wilberforce's wish to <b>remain</b> <b>an</b> independent MP. Alternatively, Wilberforce's frequent tardiness and disorganisation, as well as the chronic eye problems that at times made reading impossible, may have convinced Pitt that his trusted friend was not ministerial material. When Parliament was dissolved in the spring of 1784, Wilberforce decided to stand as a candidate for the county of Yorkshire in the 1784 general election. On 6 April, he was returned as MP for Yorkshire at the age of twenty-four.|$|E
