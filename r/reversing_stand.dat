2500|$|Art {{historian}} Cornelius Vermeule, in his {{volume on}} U.S. coins and medals, admired Aitken's Missouri piece, writing that Aitken [...] "became the first American medalist {{to apply the}} principles of Renaissance medallic design to a coin of the United States and the first such artist to make a frontiersman look like a Medici prince". He suggested that the figures on the <b>reverse</b> <b>stand</b> [...] "like Roman soldiers in an Antonine relief on the Arch of Constantine or Renaissance condottieri in a large fresco of court ceremonials." [...] Mermeule noted that [...] "the lettering on the obverse follows the forms and system of Pisanello" [...] and that [...] "the coin {{as a whole is}} a work of art rather than just another way to market a silver fifty-cent piece because all three of the mottoes that usually burden and constrict America's attempts of numismatic art are omitted." [...] The author concluded of Aitken's works, [...] "his imagination in selecting from the past to rephrase the present worked very well in the United States commemorative coinage".|$|R

6000|$|There {{had been}} talk of mono-rails for several years. But the real {{mischief}} began when Brennan sprang his gyroscopic mono-rail car upon the Royal Society. It {{was the leading}} sensation of the 1907 soirees; that celebrated demonstration-room was all too small for its exhibition. Brave soldiers, leading Zionists, deserving novelists, noble ladies, congested the narrow passage and thrust distinguished elbows into ribs the world would not willingly let break, deeming themselves fortunate if they could see [...] "just {{a little bit of}} the rail." [...] Inaudible, but convincing, the great inventor expounded his discovery, and sent his obedient little model of the trains of the future up gradients, round curves, and across a sagging wire. It ran along its single rail, on its single wheels, simple and sufficient; it stopped, <b>reversed</b> <b>stood</b> still, balancing perfectly. It maintained its astounding equilibrium amidst a thunder of applause. The audience dispersed at last, discussing how far they would enjoy crossing an abyss on a wire cable. [...] "Suppose the gyroscope stopped!" [...] Few of them anticipated a tithe of what the Brennan mono-rail would do for their railway securities and the face of the world.|$|R

Saint Mark holds the gospel, which is his usual attribute, and presents a gonfalone to the doge. The legend on the left identifies the saint as S M VENET, i.e. Saint Mark of Venice, and the legend on the right identifies the doge, with his title DVX in the field. On the <b>reverse,</b> Christ <b>stands</b> among a field of stars in an oval frame. The reverse legend is the same as on Roger II’s ducats.|$|R

50|$|Prior to 1996 CONAIE {{had been}} very untrusting of {{politicians}} and wary of those who sought {{to become involved in}} politics because of politicians' tendency to make concessions.

Rumblings began within the organization to adapt to the political process, but a statute was passed in 1995 by CONAIE prohibiting members from running for political office.
