40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an implementation of several consistent recovery protocols at the abstract device level and their performance comparison. We have performed experiments using three NAS Parallel Benchmark applications with class C datasets on {{state of the}} art equipment. The interesting result is that causal message logging protocol has the most expensive <b>recovery</b> <b>cost</b> with communication intensive applications since it su ers from concentrated overload of simultaneous message replaying. Receiver-based optimistic message logging has the least <b>recovery</b> <b>cost</b> with drawback of extensive disk access overhead in failure-free executions. Coordinated checkpointing seems the most practical choice among them. ...|$|R

2500|$|The flight {{recorders}} and suspected debris were located, {{but were not}} initially recovered due to a dispute between Adam Air and the Indonesian Government over who should pay <b>recovery</b> <b>costs.</b> Both recorders were retrieved after Adam Air agreed to pay for 7 days worth of searching. A 2009 episode of Mayday (Air Crash Investigation, Air Emergency) about Flight 574 stated that the official crash report had concluded the Inertial Reference System (IRS) had failed. This failure, which should not by itself have brought the plane down, caused the pilots to become preoccupied with trying to fix it. After changing the IRS from [...] "Navigate" [...] mode to [...] "Attitude" [...] mode, the pilots failed to manually fly the plane while the computer system recalibrated, a procedure that takes about 30 seconds. The failure to maintain {{straight and level flight}} during the recalibration caused the autopilot to completely disengage and cease compensating for the plane's tendency to roll to the right, which caused the nose of the plane to dip. In attempting to correct the pitch of the aircraft before levelling the wings, the pilot sent the aircraft into an unrecoverable downward spiral, leading to the plane suffering massive structural failure as it descended at near the speed of sound. [...] The investigation disclosed that the accident aircraft, including the faulty IRS and several other systems, had been the subject of more than 40 pilot complaints, or [...] "write ups" [...] in the months prior to the crash.|$|E

40|$|Context-aware {{applications}} automatically adapt {{their behavior}} according to environmental conditions, {{also known as}} contexts. However, in practice contexts are often inaccurate, noisy or even inconsistent (e. g., two RFID readers may report different numbers for {{the same set of}} goods processed). These kinds of problematic contexts may cause context-aware applications to behave abnormally or even fail. It is thus desirable to detect and resolve context inconsistency. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach to detect problematic contexts and resolve resulting context inconsistencies with the help of context-aware application semantics. By combining low-level context inconsistency resolution with high-level application error recovery, our approach can resolve the inconsistent contexts more effectively. Moreover, error <b>recovery</b> <b>cost</b> for context-aware applications is reduced. Our experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing approaches in terms of more accurate inconsistency resolution and less error <b>recovery</b> <b>cost...</b>|$|R
