The <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>part</b> of the global Census of Marine Life (CoML) and has disclosed some remarkable findings. More than 235 marine organisms live in both polar regions, having bridged the gap of [...] Large animals such as some cetaceans and birds make the round trip annually. More surprising are small forms of life such as sea cucumbers, and free-swimming snails found in both polar oceans. Various factors may aid in their distribution– fairly uniform temperatures of the deep ocean at the poles and the equator which differ {{by no more than}} 5°C, and the major current systems or marine conveyor belt which transport eggs and larval stages.|$|E

The bureau is headed by the Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research, Daniel B. Smith. [...] The Bureau of Intelligence and Research constructed a intelligence assessment on justifying war with Iraq. [...] The assessment was based on the seven principles of traditional just war theory and provided a framework for organizing critiques of the presumed US plans for Iraq. [...] The assessment went through each of the seven principles just cause, competent authority, last resort, justifiable cost, openness to peaceful resolution, prospect of success, and just means. [...] Each principle was analyzed against the reasons the US wanted {{to go to war with}} Iraq. [...] The assessment showed that there were problems and prospects of justifying war with Iraq.|$|E
