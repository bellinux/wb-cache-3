40|$|The top {{priority}} of car-tire suppliers {{is to improve}} wetland grip force of the using tires, reduce the rolling resistance and the rolling noise of tires. It is urgent for the tire industry to research and develop high-performance tires to solve the above problems. They must use the high- performance synthetic rubber and auxiliary rubber to develop the most advanced manufacturing technologies and equipment. Silica, a kind of important tire auxiliary rubber, can significantly reduce the rolling resistance of tires, improve the grip force and properties resistant to ice, wetness or slippery of tires. In this paper, based on the conventional tire <b>rubber</b> <b>forming</b> technologies of extrusion, dewatering, drying and expanding, a study is made on the conical screw, the dewatering barrel, the drying barrel, the pin layout scheme, the expanding die head, cutter and the control system. The nonlinear pin <b>rubber</b> <b>forming</b> equipment integrating the functions of extrusion, dewatering, drying and expanding is designed and applied to tire auxiliary <b>rubber</b> <b>forming.</b> The experiment shows that the forming device can realize the one-step forming, with high forming efficiency, low cost and less labor. ...|$|E

Metal sheet on which channel is formed can be {{implemented}} as a bipolar plate in the fuel cell. The effects of important parameters in <b>rubber</b> <b>forming</b> such as hardness and thickness of rubber pad, speed and pressure of punch that compress blank, and physical property of materials on the channel depth were analyzed. In the soft material sheet Al 1050, deeper channels are formed than in materials SS 304 and Ti-G 5. Formed channel depth was increased when hardness of rubber pad was lower, thickness of rubber pad was high, and speed and pressure of punch were high. It was found the deepest channel was achieved when forming process condition was set with punch speed and pressure at 30 mm/s and 55 MPs, respectively using rubber pad having hardness Shore A 20 and thickness 60 mm. The channel depths of bipolar plates formed with Al 1050, SS 304 and Ti-G 5 under the above process condition were 0. 453, 0. 307, and 0. 270 mm, respectively...|$|E
40|$|<b>Rubber</b> <b>forming</b> is {{a common}} process for the {{fabrication}} of flanged metallic parts in the aerospace industry. The process enables cheap tooling, which is important since the product series are limited. In the process a rigid and a soft tool are combined to form a metal blank into the required shape. Most components made in this way are “flanged parts”, i. e. parts with a rather flat web plate and curved flanges at {{the periphery of the}} web plate. For flanged parts the determination of spring back of the flanges, straight or curved, is important, since the forming dies compensated with the spring back, should result in accurate products. Like all metal forming processes elastic and plastic deformations are combined in the same process cycle. The elastic deformations result in spring back and residual stresses, the ratio between these two depends on the shape of the product and the distribution of the plastic and elastic deformations. In this research an aluminium alloy was used. The low Young’s modulus of this alloy results in rather high elastic responses upon deformation. Other aspects that have been evaluated are the effect of processing parameters like friction and distribution of strains. For stretch flanges the strain is distributed evenly along the flange, but not for shrink flanges, where buckling plays a role. Experimental research shows that the spring back of the flanges depend on a number of variables like the thickness, flange geometry, and material parameters. The spring back of a flange is also a mixture of different contributions: spring back due to the bending over the bend line, spring back due to the curvature of the flange, and spring back due to in-plane deformations. The research performed focused on the different components of the spring back and their interaction. Analysis of the data resulted in a new parameter by which a number of variables could be captured. This improves the understanding of the spring back phenomena and a generalization of the results...|$|E

40|$|Compression {{moulding}} is {{the ideal}} candidate for large series production of thermoplastic composite parts. Improvements in this production technique will make it more appealing for those markets that are reluctant to use composites because of their development costs. Unlike other composites processing systems, the compression moulding press is capable of producing fibre-reinforced plastic parts in significant volumes, with the accuracy, repeatability and speed to which, for example, the automotive industry has been accustomed in the stamping of metal parts. This thesis aims at {{a better understanding of}} the behaviour of the rubber mould during compression moulding of thermoplastics and consequently at the reduction of the development costs and improving the design of the rubber mould. The classical problems that need to be addressed when designing a rubber mould are the correct dimensions to accommodate the laminate and the positions of the details. The standard process, though, does not take into account the temperature changes in the mould during production and in particular the effect of the coefficient of thermal expansion of the rubber. In this thesis, an envisioned method to reduce this problem is to add a certain amount of aramide in the rubber mould, in order to restrict the expansion due to increased temperature. The second issue that has to be considered is the friction between the melted thermoplastic and the rubber mould. The use of lubricant is extremely effective, but can be used only in a prototyping phase, as the lubricant affects the mechanical properties of the thermoplastic composite. Proper modelling of the <b>rubber</b> <b>forming</b> process, considering the correct rubber parameters, allows identification of the problems that might occur during manufacturing. The way to eliminate those problems numerically, though, is computationally challenging as well as uncertain and time consuming. With those results in mind, an improved method was developed which substitutes the flexible rubber mould with a collection of rubber particles. The collection of rubber particles acts in a way similar to that of a fluid and has the advantage of filling the mould completely so that there is always contact between the rigid and the flexible mould. The new method allows the manufacturing of a wider range of products and allows the reduction of development costs related to the definition of the proper rubber mould shape. To be able to describe the collection of rubber particles as a homogeneus material, a series of tests has been designed for the determination of some of their physical parameters. The obtained material has a very variable stiffness, from a very low modulus when the particles are not compressed, to two orders of magnitude higher values when compaction is almost complete. Bulk and shear modulus are related to the Poisson’s ratio that does not vary much during the entire process, having a value always slightly below 0. 5. This value is consistent with the fluid-like behavior in the beginning of the process and with the, almost incompressible, solid rubber block at the end of the process. Finally, the parameters found have been used to model the compression moulding process with a collection of rubber particles. Modeling is not strictly necessary because most of the existing problems in the conventional production method have been eliminated. However it might become useful when the limitations of the new production technique will be explored and in particular for those geometries that are not possible with the conventional method.

The mechanical energy required to separate two fracture surfaces that were brought back into contact is about one order of magnitude larger than that for surfaces close to thermodynamic equilibrium. Moreover, we find that fracture faces stored apart at room temperature still self-heal after 12 h but that this self-healing can be fully deactivated {{within a couple of}} hours by annealing around 90 °C.

40|$|Abstract: Silicone rubber when {{contaminated}} by dust {{has the ability}} to transfer the hydrophobicity through pollutants. Water on the polluted silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>forms</b> separate droplets. It is a unique advantage of this material. However, the pollution layer on silicone rubber absorbs moisture at high air humidity similar to the pollutants on the glass surface. Under high humidity conditions the surface conductivity on heavy polluted (ESDD and DDD in the range of 0, 1 mg/cm 2) silicone insulators increases to the value in the range of a few mS. This leads to dry band formation, arcing and possible surface erosion. The surface conductivity on the silicone rubber contaminated a week earlier by NaCl without bentonite is very small, in the range of 0, 1 mS. The surface conductivity of 6 mS was measured on similarly polluted porcelain sample. The pure sea salt pollution is not dangerous for silicone insulators. ...|$|R
