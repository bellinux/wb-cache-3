40|$|Journalism {{and mass}} {{communication}} school graduates who have personal connections with those making hiring decisions are {{significantly more likely}} to receive job offers. Hiring is a highly uncertain and risky process, and personal familiarity reduces uncertainty. ‘ Confidence in ability to present oneself in a professional way is significantly related to <b>receiving</b> <b>job</b> <b>offers.</b> The ability of job candidates to mold their behavior to the expectations of the professional culture during interviews is likely to reassure employers. This finding suggests students should seek internships, attend professional conferences and read trade literature for the exposure of the culture of the field as much as for the exposure to practical skills. ‘ Having personal connections and having confidence in the ability to present oneself {{in a way that is}} consistent with the professional culture were more strongly related to job-finding success than the traditional, formal factors of GPA, internships, campus media involvement and curriculum sequence. ‘ Perceived ability to get along with others was not related to job-finding success.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the efficiency}} of the Finnish Employment Service's management in selecting unemployed individuals who are offered a job. The database used considers short-term unemployed individuals who face the same labour market conditions in 1996. Duration analysis with a Weibull model has been performed in order to study the determinants of the transition probability from unemployment into employment and the impact of <b>receiving</b> <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> through the Employment Service (ES). In order to carry this out, it has been taken into account that the reception of such job offers may be endogenous because the ES selects the individuals who will receive the offers. The empirical results suggest that the decisions made by the ES are adequate {{in the sense that they}} increase the benefit of society, compared with a random assignment of the vacancies offered through the ES. Moreover, the effects of the other determinants depend on whether the individual receives offers. The results also point out that individuals who receive no offers through the ES are more likely, as time passes by, to be discouraged in searching for a job than those who do. ...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical and {{empirical}} works on job search often neglect {{the role of}} unemployed environment like spatial constraints meets while searching for a job. This paper proposes a job search model where both the spatial search area and the reservation wage {{are assumed to be}} endogenous. We exploit data from a French survey conducted by Research Direction of Employment Ministry (DARES) to estimate the structural parameters of the model. First we estimate the choice of the search area, i. e. the choice between passive (<b>receiving</b> <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> through the local public employment agencies) and active strategies (extending the job search area using others search channels). Using a bivariate probit model, we highlight that this choice depends significantly on individual attributes and spatial constraints and that it affects job quality. Besides, the independence of irrelevant alternatives is not rejected. Secondly, using Gamma duration model we treat both individual and unobservable heterogeneity and the multiple destinations after unemployment (long-term jobs, short-term jobs and subsidised jobs). Moreover, estimations are made on sub-samples in which individuals are homogenous according to their level of diploma and their situation towards the unemployment insurance. Controlling for unobservable heterogeneity and selection bias, the econometric results show that the passive strategy is more efficient for lowgraduate...|$|E

40|$|The {{personal}} {{networks of}} managers have received widespread {{attention in the}} management literature in recent years because these networks represent a form of social capital for achieving various goals in economic and social life (Lin, 2001). Having an extensive network {{is a key element}} to career success (Seibert et al., 2001). Other advantages of having an extensive network include <b>receiving</b> <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> (Granovetter, 1995; Mouw, 2002), gaining access to decisions in higher authority (Podolmy & Byron, 1997), upward mobility, and information exchange (Brass, 1985). In the entrepreneurship literature, the personal network of the entrepreneur is viewed as the most important resource of the organization (Johannisson, 1990) as it is through this network that the firm acquires the necessary scarce resources for its growth and survival. The above benefits of personal networks are by no means limited to the Western world.
