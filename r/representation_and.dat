5|$|Airline EasyJet is {{interested}} in the inspection of aircraft with drones. It made a first inspection in 2015. Equipped with laser sensors and high resolution camera, the drone performs autonomous flight around the aeroplane. It generates a three-dimensional image of the aircraft and transmits it to a technician. The operator can then navigate in this <b>representation</b> <b>and</b> zoom to display a high-resolution picture of some parts of the aircraft. The operator must then visually diagnose {{the presence or absence of}} defects. This approach avoids the use of platforms to observe the upper parts of the aeroplane.|$|E

50|$|<b>Representations</b> <b>and</b> {{warranties}} by {{the seller}} {{with regard to}} the company, which are claimed to be true at both the time of signing and the time of closing. Sellers often attempt to craft their <b>representations</b> <b>and</b> warranties with knowledge qualifiers, dictating the level of knowledge applicable and which seller parties' knowledge is relevant. Some agreements provide that if the <b>representations</b> <b>and</b> warranties by the seller prove to be false, the buyer may claim a refund of part of the purchase price, as is common in transactions involving privately held companies (although in most acquisition agreements involving public company targets, the <b>representations</b> <b>and</b> warranties of the seller do not survive the closing). Representations regarding a target company's net working capital are a common source of post-closing disputes.|$|R
5|$|During the 1990s, {{the company}} {{was the subject of}} {{controversy}} for its official stance against gay and lesbian employees and for discriminatory practices against African-American customers and female employees. In 2004, a U.S. Department of Justice (USDOJ) investigation found that Cracker Barrel discriminated against minority customers; patrons complained of racially segregated seating and service quality. In an agreement with the USDOJ, Cracker Barrel implemented non-discrimination policies and pledged to focus on improving minority <b>representation</b> <b>and</b> civic involvement, particularly in the black community. Company shareholders added sexual orientation to the company's non-discrimination policy in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Flower was {{intended}} as a spiritual successor to Flow. Using the PlayStation 3's motion sensitive controller, the player controls wind that blows a flower petal through the air. Flying close to flowers results in the player's petal being followed by other flower petals. Approaching flowers may also have side-effects on the game world, such as bringing vibrant color to previously dead fields or activating stationary windmills. The game features no text or dialogue, forming a narrative arc primarily through visual <b>representation</b> <b>and</b> emotional cues. It was released for the PlayStation 3 on February 12, 2009.|$|E

In 1943, Roy Zimmerman's refusal to play an exhibition game without compensation resulted in his trade from the Washington Redskins to the Philadelphia Eagles. With {{the formation of the}} competing All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in 1946, NFL owners instituted a rule which banned a player for five years from NFL-associated employment if he left the league to join the AAFC.|$|E
