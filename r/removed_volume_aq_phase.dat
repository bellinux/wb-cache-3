Tetra-methyl-ortho-silicate (TMOS) {{is often used}} as a precursor in sol-gel chem. to produce silica gels in aq. systems. TMOS can also be mixed with many hydrocarbons without chem. reaction, which allows for various applications in multiphase systems. In this study, TMOS was mixed with n-hexadecane and placed together with water in small cylinders.
