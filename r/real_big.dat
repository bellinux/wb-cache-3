500|$|Rather {{than being}} {{considered}} a separate sport on its own, ski flying {{is essentially an}} offshoot of ski jumping involving larger hills and longer jump distances. According to former US national ski jumping coach Larry Stone, [...] "It's the same thing, just bigger. You're going faster and flying higher. ... Basically, it's just a <b>real</b> <b>big</b> jump." [...] The competitive standard for distance in ski flying is {{in the range of}} , with 254m being the absolute longest distance reached to date. By comparison, the longest ever distance from a ski jumping hill is , set at Mühlenkopfschanze ("Mühlenkopf hill") in Willingen, Germany.

500|$|On Burton's hiring, he and Logan {{reworked}} the screenplay; Logan {{felt they}} agreed over the film's tone due to [...] "share stunted childhoods watching Amicus movies". Turning a three-hour stage musical into a two-hour film required some changes. Some songs were shortened, {{while others were}} completely removed. Burton said [...] "In terms of the show, it was three hours long, but we weren't out to film the Broadway show, we were {{out to make a}} movie, so we tried to keep the pace like those old melodramas. Sondheim himself is not a <b>real</b> <b>big</b> fan of movie musicals, so he was really open to honing it down to a more pacey shape." [...] Burton and Logan also reduced the prominence of other secondary elements, such as the romance between Todd's daughter Johanna and Anthony, to allow them to focus on the triangular relationship between Todd, Mrs. Lovett, and Toby.|$|E

500|$|Led Zeppelin {{have been}} {{credited}} with {{a major impact on}} the nature of the music business, particularly in the development of album-orientated rock (AOR) and stadium rock. In 1988 John Kalodner, then-A executive of Geffen Records, remarked that [...] "In my opinion, next to the Beatles they're the most influential band in history. They influence the way music is on records, AOR radio, concerts. They set the standards for the AOR-radio format with 'Stairway to Heaven,' having AOR hits without necessarily having Top 40 hits. They're the ones who did the first <b>real</b> <b>big</b> arena concert shows, consistently selling out and playing stadiums without support. People can do as well as them, but nobody surpasses them". Andrew Loog Oldham, the former producer and manager of the Rolling Stones, commented on how Led Zeppelin had a major influence on the record business, and the way rock concerts were managed and presented to huge audiences.|$|E
500|$|McDonald's {{initially}} {{downplayed the}} new sandwich, with a spokesman stating {{that there was}} only one place to get the <b>real</b> <b>Big</b> Mac. Despite McDonald's claims that the sandwich was not a major issue for the company, its highly promoted Arch Deluxe sandwich was not a success and its [...] "Campaign 55" [...] promotion, which reduced the price of certain sandwiches to 55¢ (USD), was eliminated after franchisees complained that it had failed to boost sales. Against McDonald's struggles, Burger King's successful introduction of the Big King was later paired with a newly introduced, improved type of french fry in November of the same year. Along with these two product introductions, the company began a massive financial investment in product development across all parts of its menu which, in total, provided a boost in the chain's market performance. The mirrored failure and success for the two companies showed itself in the market share of the United States fast-food market: Burger King's share rose a percentage point, to 19.2%, while McDonald's share slipped 0.4 points, to 41.9% by the end of 1997. The McDonald's drop capped a three-year decline in the larger chain's market share in the United States, which stood at 42.3% at the start of 1995.|$|E

Pierce was chosen to start the All-Star Game for the AL – the first White Sox pitcher ever to do so – and allowed only one hit through three innings (a single by Stan Musial). Boston Red Sox star Ted Williams recalled of the game: [...] "It was a hot day at Crosley Field and I remember being so concerned for little Billy Pierce of the White Sox. Billy probably threw harder than anybody for a guy his size, he had a <b>real</b> <b>big</b> delivery, nice to look at, and he had overcome a lot. I understand he had had epilepsy, and I was really pulling for him. He was a nervous little guy, {{and here he was}} starting his first All-Star game in a bandbox park that's tough to pitch in, and against Robin Roberts to boot. Pierce held them {{in the palm of his}} hand that day. He threw the ball right by everybody." ...|$|E

If you {{watch a lot of}} the stuff I do, you can almost see the influence in it, Because these animators would animate these performances that were off the hook, And the guy that, the guy that did the voices was Mel Blanc.

2500|$|After {{the release}} of The Real Thing, Faith No More {{developed}} somewhat of a rivalry with fellow Californian funk rock group Red Hot Chili Peppers, whom they had previously played with on The Uplift Mofo Party Tour. Singer Anthony Kiedis accused Mike Patton of stealing his [...] "style" [...] in the [...] "Epic" [...] music video. He told Kerrang! magazine [...] "My drummer says he’s gonna kidnap , shave his hair off and cut off one of his feet, just so he’ll be forced to find a style of his own". In a separate interview, he clarified his comment, remarking [...] "I love The Real Thing, and I liked his vocals on that record. I mean, when I heard the record I noticed subtle similarities, but when I saw that video it was like, 'Wait a second here, what the fuck?.'" [...] Roddy Bottum responded by saying [...] "To me, our band sounds nothing like Red Hot Chili Peppers. If you're talking about long hair, rapping with his shirt off, then yeah, I can see similarities. But beyond that, I can't see any. I haven't talked to them since this whole thing started. We're really good friends with that band and i'd like to think they're doing it... like as a favour". Mike Patton finally addressed the allegations from Kiedis in 1990, commenting that [...] "It just kind of {{came out of the}} blue. It doesn't bother me a bit. I got a <b>real</b> <b>big</b> kick out of it to tell you the truth. I mean, if he's gonna talk about me in interviews, that's fine - it's free press! Either he's feeling inadequate or old or I don't know, but I have no reason to talk shit about him." [...] Later in 2001, Patton also theorized that [...] "I think Anthony, deep down, feels like I'm a better dancer than he is. I think I shake my booty just a little bit fresher than he does. And if he would stop doing drugs I think he could outdance me. Maybe one day we'll have a breakoff, just breakdance." ...|$|E
