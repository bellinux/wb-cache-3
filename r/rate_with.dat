5|$|In 1981, Faisalabad {{was among}} four districts in Punjab, which {{included}} Gujranwala, Jhelum and Gujrat, that were experiencing low literacy rates, due primarily {{to either a}} lack of resources or family pressure; the latter of which may also be attributable to illiteracy.

5|$|As noted above, {{variants}} that {{deviate from}} this template are known; what designates a Nazarov cyclization {{in particular is}} the generation of the pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation. In order to achieve this transformation, the molecule {{must be in the}} s-trans/s-trans conformation, placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation. The propensity of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction <b>rate,</b> <b>with</b> α-substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain. Coordination of an electron donating α-substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation.|$|E

5|$|Jorge Remes Lenicov {{resigned}} in April, alongside ministers De Mendiguren and Capitanich. Peronist governors, legislators, and union leaders {{met at the}} Quinta de Olivos, amid rumors that Duhalde would appoint the populist Daniel Carbonetto as minister of economy. They gave their full support {{to the president and}} the economic policies instrumented so far. As a result, Duhalde appointed the conservative Roberto Lavagna. Lavagna was the Argentine ambassador to the European Union, and switched offices with Remes Lenicov. He was suggested by Governor Carlos Ruckauf and supported by Alfonsín. He stabilised prices and the exchange <b>rate</b> <b>with</b> tight fiscal and monetary policies, and prevented the crisis from growing into an hyperinflation. The recovery also benefited from the idle capacity of the economy.|$|E

5|$|Minibuses are {{the most}} common type of public {{transportation}} in Mogadishu. The next most frequently used public vehicles in the city are auto rickshaws (bajaj). They number around 3,000 units and come in various designs. The auto rickshaws represent a lower cost alternative to taxis and minibuses, typically charging half the price for the same distance, with flexible rates. Due to their affordability, capacity to negotiate narrow lanes and low fuel consumption, the three-wheeled vehicles are often appealing investment opportunities for small-scale entrepreneurs. They are generally preferred for shorter commutes. In June 2013, two new taxi companies also started offering road transportation to residents. Part of a fleet of over 100 vehicles, Mogadishu Taxi's trademark yellow cabs offer rides throughout the city at flat rates of $5. City Taxi, the firm's nearest competitor, charges the same flat <b>rate,</b> <b>with</b> plans to add new cabs to its fleet.|$|E
5|$|The Intel 8080 did {{not have}} {{dedicated}} circuitry to support dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) because in 1975, this type of memory was still a new technology. MITS wanted to use DRAM because it consumed less power than static RAM. However, they had several design and component problems {{that led to a}} high failure <b>rate</b> <b>with</b> their 4K Dynamic RAM board. By July, new companies such as Processor Technology were selling 4K Static RAM boards with the promise of reliable operation. MITS released its own 4K Static RAM board in January 1976.|$|E
5|$|The greater honeyguide guides {{people in}} some parts of Africa to the nests of wild bees. A guiding bird attracts a person's {{attention}} with a chattering call, and flies in short bounds towards a bees' nest. When the human honey-hunter has taken their honey, the honeyguide eats what is left. The Boran people of East Africa use a specific whistle, which doubles the encounter <b>rate</b> <b>with</b> honeyguides; they find that using a honeyguide reduces the time to find honey by two-thirds. The Bushmen of the Kalahari thank the honeyguide with a gift of honey.|$|E

5|$|Under normal {{conditions}} about 75% {{of the eggs}} hatch. Hatching success can drop to about 35% in unusually hot conditions. Egg shell thinning, a potential cause of egg mortality, {{can be caused by}} pollutants. About 78% of chicks fledge in normal years, with that percentage only dropping slightly, to 77%, in abnormally hot years. Most egg and chick mortality during periods of normal climate is caused by nest fights between the parents and other birds. Breeding adults usually survive the year, with only about 18% dying every year. The young have a lower survival <b>rate,</b> <b>with</b> about 29% dying each year. The lifespan for this bird is anywhere from 16 to 30 years.|$|E
5|$|When the {{pressure}} within the skull (intracranial pressure, abbreviated ICP) rises too high, {{it can be}} deadly. Signs of increased ICP include decreasing level of consciousness, paralysis or weakness {{on one side of}} the body, and a blown pupil, one that fails to constrict in response to light or is slow to do so. Cushing's triad, a slow heart <b>rate</b> <b>with</b> high blood pressure and respiratory depression is a classic manifestation of significantly raised ICP. Anisocoria, unequal pupil size, is another sign of serious TBI. Abnormal posturing, a characteristic positioning of the limbs caused by severe diffuse injury or high ICP, is an ominous sign.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{factors such}} as time spent outside and {{distance}} travelled by workers has been correlated to colony size. Workers living in smaller colonies tend to forage smaller distances and spend less time outside, whereas those in larger colonies spend more time outside and at greater distances from their nest. Such results have also {{been seen in the}} western honey bee (Apis mellifera), but, unlike the honey bees, workers from small and large colonies transported equal workloads. The decreased foraging time may reduce the risk of predation and save energy; for example, the limited energy in R.aurata is a result of time spent looking for food sources, rather than the collection of food items. The shorter foraging periods seen in smaller colonies results in these nests preserving energy and adopting behaviour that is less energetic. Group retrieval only occurs if a worker encounters another nestmate that is heavily loaded with resources. As these ants are solitary foragers and rarely recruit other nestmates, the chance of a worker encountering others is improved by marking the ground with trail pheromones. This behaviour may serve as a simple method of localised chemical recruitment of other nestmates. Marking behaviour increases when workers encounter large prey items, which suggests that foragers with heavy loads deliberately try to raise the encounter <b>rate</b> <b>with</b> nestmates. However, when workers are transporting small to large crickets, marking behaviour decreases to ensure transport efficiency and lower the retrieval time for other ants. Workers can quickly readjust their foraging activity in accordance with food quality.|$|E
