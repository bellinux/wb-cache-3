40|$|Abstract: This {{experimental}} study of dynamic wetting in metering and pre-metered forward roll coating shows that the dimensionless applicator flow rate λA, is the key parameter as it defines whether dynamic failure occurs by air entrainment (λA>λA, trans) or cascade (λA< λA, trans). λA, trans is the flow rate when the regime switches from metering to pre-metered and λA, min, the minimum flow rate in the pre-metered regime. When Ca was varied in the range 0. 2 → 5, λA, trans and λA, min were in the range 1. 40 → 1. 29 and 1. 20 → 1. 18 respectively. These values compare very well with theoretical predictions. The air entrainment speeds V*M {{were found to be}} similar to the corresponding speeds V*plunging, measured in plunging tape flow but the cascade speeds V**M can be smaller or larger depending on λA. This led to exploring hydrodynamic assistance and drawing an analogy with curtain coating, which was supported by the data. It was also observed that cascade occurred in the pre-metered regime because the dynamic wetting line XD, moves near the minimum gap position just as in <b>reverse</b> roll <b>coating.</b> Indeed the cascade speeds conform to correlations developed for <b>reverse</b> roll <b>coating.</b> Finally the study gives data on XD, and compares them with theoretical predictions. The agreement in this case is only qualitative and this points to deficiencies in current modeling of the dynamic wetting region...|$|R
50|$|<b>Reverse</b> roll <b>coating</b> is a roll-to-roll coating {{method for}} wet coatings. It is {{distinguished}} from other roll coating methods by having two reverse-running nips. The metering roll and the applicator roll contra-rotate, with an accurate gap between them. The {{surface of the}} applicator roll is loaded with an excess of coating prior to the metering nip, so its surface emerges from the metering nip with a precise thickness of coating equal to the gap. At the application nip, the applicator roll transfers all of this coating to the substrate, by running {{in the opposite direction}} to the movement of the substrate, wiping the coating onto the substrate.|$|R
40|$|Although spaying {{can result}} in {{qualitative}} hair coat changes in dogs, the influence of spaying on the hair growth cycle has never been described. The study aims were to {{examine the effect of}} spaying and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) treatment on canine hair coat, cycle stages of hair follicles, plasma gonadotropin concentrations and mRNA transcription of luteinizing hormone (LH) and GnRH receptors in hair follicles. Fifteen female dogs were examined before and 1 year after spaying and 24 spayed dogs before and after GnRH treatment. Spaying resulted in increased plasma gonadotropin concentrations and increased anagen : telogen ratio of hair follicles, but only 20 % of the dogs developed coat changes. No differences were found in mRNA transcription of LH and GnRH receptors. GnRH treatment resulted in reduced plasma gonadotropin concentrations and improvement of coat changes in 79 % of patients. This was associated with an increase in catagen hair follicles without changes in the anagen : telogen ratio. The present study demonstrated that spaying had an effect on the anagen : telogen ratio of hair follicles. Spaying-induced coat changes did not correlate with the anagen : telogen ratio. GnRH treatment reduced gonadotropin concentrations and <b>reversed</b> <b>coat</b> changes in some dogs, but had no effect on the hair growth cycle other than increasing the number of catagen hair follicles. A weak positive correlation between the plasma LH concentration and the anagen : telogen ratio was noted; however, our data did not suggest a direct receptor-mediated hormonal effect on the hair follicle. The present study did not identify the pathomechanism of spaying-induced coat changes...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of a coating operation is to transfer a defect free liquid film onto a continuous substrate {{in order to}} meet the requirements of the final products. Mainly two concerns govern the process. The first concern is the economics of the process and the second concern is the quality of the coated film. The economics of the process are dictated by the speed of coating and the film thickness. Clearly, higher speeds mean better productivity hence less cost of operation and thinner films are desirable because less material is being used. Quality is governed by film uniformity and integrity, indicating that the film will perform as designed. Film defects such as streaks or tiny air bubbles are indication that the film properties are not uniform rendering it unacceptable to customers. One of the most versatile coating systems to achieve thin films at high speeds is <b>reverse</b> roll <b>coating</b> which has been used for a long time all over the world. At low speed, typically 1 m/s, this coating operation is inherently stable and with small gaps of order 100 microns can ii lead to film thickness of order 30 - 50 microns. Much research, theoretical and experimental, has been devoted to this coating flow but only at low speeds and for large gaps (> 100 microns). There are no comprehensive data how very thin films, 20 microns and less (particularly lower limits in the region of 5 microns) can be achieved at high speeds, of 2 or more metres per second. This study is concerned precisely with this aim, that of investigating the effect of large speeds and small roller gaps (rollers nearly touching or in elastohydrodynamic contact) to achieve the very thin films desired by modern applications (electronics, medical and others). In order to achieve this aim, a rig was designed and built to enable to understand the effect of various coating conditions and liquid properties on the metered film thickness and coating instability. To achieve thin films at high speeds, small roll gap and low viscosity are needed, however flow instabilities will develop under these conditions. To achieve stable coating window at high speeds high surface tension is needed. It was found that the roll gap and the viscosity have complicated effect on the coating window. In the case of low viscosity liquid (7 mPa. s), small roll gaps are needed, whereas in the case of high viscosity liquid (more than 30 mPa. s), large gaps are needed. It was found that Weber number is better describer for ribbing instability in rigid <b>reverse</b> roll <b>coating</b> unlike in rigid forward roll coating in which capillary number is the one. In addition the potential of <b>reverse</b> deformable roll <b>coating</b> (rolls in elastohydrodynamic contact) was investigated in order to achieve much thinner films at higher speeds. As a result of the investigation of <b>reverse</b> deformable roll <b>coating,</b> it was found that there is a possibility to get much thinner stable films at much higher speeds compared to <b>reverse</b> rigid roll <b>coating.</b> The liquid transfer from an applicator roller to a PET film was investigated in this study. It was found that air stagnation at downstream meniscus and air entrainment at upstream meniscus depend on the liquid properties such as viscosity and surface tension and coating conditions such as web tension and wrap angle of web. As a result, wet film instability also depends on liquid properties and coating conditions. It was found that air stagnation causes streaks on the wet film and air entrainment caused bubbles on the wet film. To get a stable wet film, it was found that suitable viscosity and high surface tension were needed. TOYOB...|$|R
