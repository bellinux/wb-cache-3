The conversion was not completed until June 1945 and work on Cefalu was not due until July. Even the conversion of Contessa was ineffective with the ship being returned to San Francisco on 20 September 1945 because its refrigeration could not maintain required low temperatures in the tropics.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn <b>refrigerated</b> <b>spaces,</b> {{the inside}} air is cooled by {{a heat sink}} {{operating}} either by forced or natural convection. The last situation is more frequently used in small apparatus, such as domestic household refrigerators. The inside air temperature is not usually monitored in these <b>refrigerated</b> <b>spaces.</b> Therefore, knowledge of the air temperature field inside of these units is limited and large air temperature gradients often exist that can put the stored products at risk. This work studies temperatures in a commercial household refrigerator that were monitored with thermocouples located at several points. The measured temperatures were then compared with those obtained from two different simulation tools: the Fluent code and another method based on an Artificial Neural Network with supervised learning performed using a Genetic Algorithm. Results lead to the conclusion that, {{at least in this}} case, the second tool produced a lower absolute error (0. 8 K) when compared with the first (1 K) and yielded modelled inside air temperature fields that are more consistent with reality...|$|R

50|$|The {{excavation}} of the Ice Maiden {{was carried out}} with great care, although {{in some ways it}} has been seen as problematic, due to the methods used to melt the ice and remove the artifacts and body from the coffin.

50|$|Due to the {{construction}} of the evaporator there are two failure modes. The first is not a failure of the evaporator but rather the consequence of a failing boiler assembly. As an example, if the fridge has been operated off-level and the boiler is allowed to overheat, the volume of liquid ammonia Q4 is reduced. The reduced ammonia flow Q4 results in the ammonia evaporating before reaching {{the lower half of the}} evaporator. As a result, the freezer may be very cold, while the <b>refrigerated</b> <b>space</b> is too warm to prevent food spoilage.|$|E
50|$|The {{evaporator}} {{is located}} within the foam cabinet in an RV Fridge. When one looks into either the freezer or refrigerated cabinets the back wall will generally have an aluminum plate which may have fins for increasing surface area for the absorption of heat from the <b>refrigerated</b> <b>space.</b> Depending on the type and construction of the RV Fridge, {{as a rule of}} thumb, {{the top half of the}} evaporator is in thermal contact with the freezer section and the lower half is in contact with the refrigerated section of the cabinet.|$|E

50|$|The RV Fridge {{evaporator}} {{is where}} cooling of the refrigerated cabinet occurs. Basically all refrigeration process use evaporation for cooling. In the absorption type RV Fridge liquid ammonia Q4 enters from the condenser and flows down the evaporator. Within the evaporator the liquid ammonia {{comes in contact}} with the assistant gas which is generally hydrogen. Due to Dalton's law of partial pressures the liquid ammonia Q4 evaporates thereby absorbing heat from within the <b>refrigerated</b> <b>space.</b> Because the ammonia gas Q5 is heavier than the assistant gas, the ammonia gas flows out the bottom of the evaporator.|$|E

5000|$|A {{common form}} of {{refrigeration}} economizer is a [...] "walk-in cooler economizer" [...] or [...] "outside air refrigeration system". In such a system outside air that is cooler than the air inside a <b>refrigerated</b> <b>space</b> is brought into that space and {{the same amount of}} warmer inside air is ducted outside. The resulting cooling supplements or replaces the operation of a compressor-based refrigeration system. If the air inside a cooled space is only about 5°F warmer than the outside air that replaces it (that is, the ∆T>5°F) this cooling effect is accomplished more efficiently than the same amount of cooling resulting from a compressor based system. If the outside air is not cold enough to overcome the refrigeration load of the space the compressor system will need to also operate, or the temperature inside the space will rise.|$|E
