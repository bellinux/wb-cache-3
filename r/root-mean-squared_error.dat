In combination with the partical least square (PLS), the quantitative calibration models of forsythoside A and ethanol-extract were established.

Moreover, analytical parsimonious models are desired to provide forecasts and different utilized learning algorithms are further compared based on some specified performance measures.

40|$|In vitro {{study of}} the {{deposition}} of drug particles is commonly used during development of formulations for pulmonary delivery. The assay is demanding, complex, and depends on: properties of the drug and carrier particles, including size, surface characteristics, and shape; interactions between the drug and carrier particles and assay conditions, including flow rate, type of inhaler, and impactor. The aerodynamic properties of an aerosol are measured in vitro using impactors {{and in most cases}} are presented as the fine particle fraction, which is a mass percentage of drug particles with an aerodynamic diameter below 5 µm. In the present study, a model {{in the form of a}} mathematical equation was developed for prediction of the fine particle fraction. The feature selection was performed using the R-environment package “fscaret”. The input vector was reduced from a total of 135 independent variables to 28.

40|$|Economists {{are often}} puzzled {{as to why}} profit-maximizing firms buy {{professional}} forecasts when statistics such as the <b>root-mean-squared</b> <b>error</b> or the mean absolute error often indicate that a naive model will forecast about as well.

Using profit measures, the authors find only very weak relationships between such summary error statistics and forecast value. If these results are robust, then least-squares regression analysis may not be appropriate for many studies of economic behavior. Copyright 1991 by American Economic Association. ...|$|E
30|$|However, {{because of}} the large {{dimension}} data set (1197 objects), the initial CART model is highly complex with a very high number of nodes. This model produces very accurate prediction for the training data but largely fails to predict accurately when supplied with unknown data (the objects of validation set). This is the well-known overfitting problem. The determination of a smaller tree, got from the maximal one, is therefore essential for successful modeling. The choice of the ideal tree is accomplished by a tree pruning methodology. Many techniques were used to generate the optimal model like examination of resubstitution error, cross-validation, control depth, evaluating <b>root-mean-squared</b> <b>error</b> (RMSE), correlation coefficient (R) and mean absolute error (MAE).|$|E
30|$|Stage 2 can {{be split}} into steps 2 a, 2 b, etc., each {{corresponding}} to beamformers with different beam widths, resolutions, and scan areas. The {{number of steps}} depends on {{the ratio of the}} resulting <b>root-mean-squared</b> <b>error</b> (RMSE) of stage 1 and the required RMSE of stage 2. The larger the ratio, the more steps should be used to keep the number of observation intervals down. The coefficients in stage 2 a are chosen to create relatively wide (sector) beams for the subarrays in order to decrease the number of points on the scan grid, while still providing an SNR (signal-to-noise-ratio) gain compared to that of the omnidirectional antennas. This translates into a smaller number of sequence periods required for estimation.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Calculation of the viewshed from {{a digital}} {{elevation}} model (OEM) is a common capability of a GIS packages.

40|$|Denoising electrocardiographic (ECG) signals is an {{essential}} procedure prior to their analysis. In this paper, we present a normalized adaptive neural filter (NANF) for cancellation of artifacts in ECG signals. The normalized filter coefficients are updated by the steepest-descent algorithm; the adaptation process is designed to minimize the difference between second-order estimated output values and the desired artifact-free ECG signals. Empirical results with benchmark data show that the adaptive artifact canceller that includes the NANF can effectively remove muscle-contraction artifacts and high-frequency noise in ambulatory ECG recordings, leading to a high signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, {{the performance of the}} NANF in terms of the <b>root-mean-squared</b> <b>error,</b> normalized correlation coefficient, and filtered artifact entropy is significantly better than that of the popular least-mean-square (LMS) filter...|$|E
