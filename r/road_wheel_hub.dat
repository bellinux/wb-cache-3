40|$|Abstract. A <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> {{is a key}} rotor {{component}} of automobile. Nowadays alloy <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs</b> are used more and more widely. They are typically lighter for the same strength and provide better heat conduction. As we know that do a FEA (finite element analysis) is necessary {{before and after the}} alloy <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs</b> have been made. In this paper, a detail analysis was done with FEM (finite element method), and the stress distribution of <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> we got was consistent with the real distribution. Also the FEA results show that the maximum stress is much less the yield stress and the working safety factor is less than the allowed safety factor and it is useful for further work such as fatigue life prediction and reliability assessment...|$|R

50|$|An inboard {{braking system}} is an {{automobile}} technology wherein the disc brakes are {{mounted on the}} chassis of the vehicle, rather than directly on the <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs.</b> The main advantages are twofold: {{a reduction in the}} unsprung weight of the <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs,</b> as this no longer includes the brake discs and calipers; also,braking torque applies directly to the chassis, rather than being taken through the suspension arms.|$|R
40|$|The {{failure of}} the left <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> {{assembly}} was due to fatigue cracking of the rear half hub. The sharp edges resulting from the fracture {{were responsible for the}} deflation of the tyre. Evidences suggest that abnormal forces acted on the outboard surface of the <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> resulting in pulling apart of the two hubs. The most probable reason for the generation of such forces appears to be either due to heavy landing or inadequate tyre pressure. This had resulted in digging of the axle flange into the <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> with subsequent fatigue crack initiation at these locations. No abnormalities such as over-tightening of the bolts, material defects etc were responsible for the failure...|$|R

Based on the simulation result, the solidification characteristics of the original project were compared with two modified projects and accordingly the optimized casting project with chill and rider feeding was selected for application during the development of the <b>wheel</b> <b>hub.</b> The result shows that casting shrinkage defect has been effectively controlled and the trial production cycle of the <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> was significantly shortened...|$|R

In this paper we demonstrate, one of the rapid prototyping techniques FDM is used to produce the working model of Aircraft <b>Wheel</b> <b>hub.</b> Meanwhile the task is to reduce the stress concentration in the <b>Wheel</b> <b>Hub</b> due to body weight of aircraft and other loads on the <b>wheel</b> <b>hub.</b> For design of the <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> Catia V 5 is used. It is analysed by using the ANSYS. While analyzing the stress, stress concentration is found in the fixed regions (location of its bolts). The stress concentration is checked in three ways and selecting the one which gives the optimum stress concentration. The three ways are Design modification, Material changing without design modifications, material changing with design modification. From these three ways we will find out optimum changes in stress concentration. After selecting the best design and converting that 3 D-CAD file into STL file or saving file in STL form.
