40|$|This paper generalizes the {{analysis}} of distributive con?ict, politics, and growth developed by by Alesina-Rodrik (1994). We construct a heterogenous-agent framework in which both growth {{and the distribution of}} wealth are endogenous. Due to adjustments in the distribution of wealth, the composition of factor ownership across households equalizes in the long run. This implies that the optimal tax rate is the same for all households and equals the growth maximizing tax rate. Hence, there is no distributive con?ict in the long run. When the model is augmented with a non-political <b>redistributive</b> <b>policy,</b> the model predicts that long run growth exhibits a negative monotonic relationship with respect to this policy, i. e., a <b>redistributive</b> <b>policy</b> that leads to a more equitable wealth distribution unambiguously reduces growth in the long run...|$|E
40|$|Does {{economic}} inequality affect <b>redistributive</b> <b>policy?</b> This paper {{turns to}} U.

Examining within-state variation also reduces the potential impact of latent institutional and political variables. The paper also uses a variety of identification strategies, including historic variables as well as county weather and crop characteristics, as instruments for land inequality. The evidence consistently suggests that greater inequality is significantly associated with less redistribution. This negative relationship is especially large in heavily rural counties, where concentrated landownership implied that landed elites also controlled the majority of economic production.

40|$|Analyses of <b>redistributive</b> <b>policies</b> {{generally}} {{focus on}} income flows while subordinating most concerns to the overarching objective of promoting economic growth. This paper follows {{an alternative approach}} {{with the objective of}} proposing an asset-centred analytical framework, which encompasses income flows, but is centred on the stock of income-generating assets in the private and public sectors. Such a stock-flow approach reveals an artificial blind spot common to many analyses of redistributive policies: wealth redistribution. The proposed framework further allows better outlining key linkages between <b>redistributive</b> <b>policies</b> and sustainable development, including issues arising from the private ownership and overexploitation of finite natural resources. Contrasting the potential scope of asset-centred <b>redistributive</b> <b>policies</b> with the more narrow set of policies that have been implemented in most countries/regions over the last 30 years, the paper makes several recommendations for <b>redistributive</b> <b>policies</b> in support of greater equity, economic democracy and sustainable development. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper tests {{predictions}} of <b>redistributive</b> <b>policy</b> theory. Lowi claims that <b>redistributive</b> <b>policy</b> is not influenced by economic conditions. Limited empirical evidence exists {{to confirm this}} prediction, and what little evidence exists is indefinite. Policy theory also suggests that such a policy need not produce actual outcomes, but rather, only possess the capacity to produce outcomes.

This paper tests this hypothesis using results from the General Social Survey and data from the Current Population Survey. Revisiting one redistributive program {{during a period of}} economic downturn—a US Department of Labor initiative that was found to have produced measurable redistribution during the economic growth of the 1990 s—this study examines both capacity and reallocation, and partially confirms that redistributive policies are impervious to recession. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: The social {{environment}} {{is a fundamental}} determinant of early child development and, in turn, early child development is a determinant of health, well-being, and learning skills across the life course. <b>Redistributive</b> <b>policies</b> aimed at reducing social inequalities, such as a welfare state and labour market policies, have shown a positive association with selected health indicators. In this study, we investigated the influence of <b>redistributive</b> <b>policies</b> specifically on the {{social environment}} of early child development in five countries with different political traditions. The objective of this analysis was to highlight similarities and differences in social and health services between the countries and their associations with other health outcomes that can inform better global early child development policies and improve early child health and development. Methods: Four social determinants of early child development were selected to provide a cross-section of key time periods in a child's life from prenatal to kindergarten. They included: 1) prenatal care, 2) maternal leave, 3) child health care, and 4) child care and early childhood education. We searched international databases and reports (e. g. Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, World Bank, and UNICEF) to obtain information about early child development policies, services and outcomes. Results: Although a comparative analysis cannot claim causation, our analysis suggests that <b>redistributive</b> <b>policies</b> aimed at reducing social inequalities {{are associated with a}} positive influence on the social determinants of early child development. Generous <b>redistributive</b> <b>policies</b> are associated with a higher maternal leave allowance and pay and more preventive child healthcare visits. A decreasing trend in infant mortality, low birth weight rate, and under five mortality rate were observed with an increase in <b>redistributive</b> <b>policies.</b> No clear influence of <b>redistributive</b> <b>policies</b> was observed on breastfeeding and immunization rates. In the analysis of child care and early education, the lack of uniform measures of early child development outcomes was apparent.

40|$|I {{develop a}} model in order to study long-run effects of the {{heterogeneity}} of wealth and efficiency among agents. More precisely I consider overlapping generations of agents who differ from one another in wealth and inefficiency level. Those agents, when young, choose whether to invest or not in human capital. Since the net return of human capital investment is positive, agents who can afford human capital investment, do invest. In the second period of life, agents make an occupational choice. They choose if being workers or entrepreneurs. There exists a critical level of inefficiency below which becoming entrepreneur is profitable. The wealth distribution of agents changes over time because of wealth accumulation process. The long run distribution is stationary and can be ergodic or not, with long-run occupational mobility or not. Theoretical results are analyzed in a <b>redistributive</b> <b>policy</b> perspective. When long-run distribution of wealth is ergodic, one-shot redistributive policies are ineffective, whereas repetitive redistribution are effective. When lung-run distribution collapses to a unique level of wealth and to a unique occupation, no kind of <b>redistributive</b> <b>policy</b> is possible. ...|$|E

Using data from Taiwan Social Change Survey of 2006, the findings from this study provide supportive evidence for the arguments of previous literature and offer some further distinct results. In particular, under the social and cultural context of an East Asian country, the linkages between religious affiliation and frequency of religious attendance and preferences for <b>redistributive</b> <b>policies</b> are different from what have been found in studies of Western Christian societies. Being Protestant leads to a more favorable attitude toward several social insurance and welfare programs in Taiwan, while Buddhists and Taoists tend to be more supportive of a governmentâ€™s role in providing health care and believers of folk religions are more favorable for the provision of financial help to students from low-income families. By contrast, the frequency of religious attendance displays some negative relationships with preferences for <b>redistributive</b> <b>policies.</b> As an important part of traditional cultures, religion is influential to the cultivation and indoctrination of peopleâ€™s beliefs about fairness, social justice, and the legitimization of <b>redistributive</b> <b>policies.</b> income redistribution, welfare policies, religion, redistribution, religion, welfare policies...|$|R

We …nd that a higher adjustment cost for human capital slows down the intergenerational mobility and results in persistent inequality across generations. This result is robust in alternative environments. In addition to adjustment cost, other productivity parameters such as the output elasticity of human capital, labour supply elasticity of home production and the productivity of child care determine the intergenerational mobility. A public <b>redistributive</b> <b>policy</b> favouring poor helps the intergnerational mobility.

40|$|As {{its title}} suggests, the thesis {{considers}} various theoretical aspects of optimal government policy. The method {{is described in}} Chapter One: it is essentially that of `normative' public economics and provides the common theme of the remaining chapters. Chapters Two and Three are concerned with <b>redistributive</b> <b>policy</b> in general. Chapter Two discusses the use of observed information in <b>redistributive</b> <b>policy.</b> It derives the appropriate optimality conditions in simple models of redistribution, comparing the outcome with the existing theoretical literature and actual <b>redistributive</b> <b>policy.</b> Chapter Three considers quantities as redistributive tools, {{in contrast with the}} more usual concentration on incomes and prices. Chapter Four addresses the optimal taxation of wealth. To tax current wealth under optimal life-cycle saving may imply negative marginal tax rates at some point of the tax schedule, an outcome avoided when lifetime wealth is taxed directly. The principal theoretical obstacle to redistributing wealth is found to be the anticipation of tax implementation. Chapters Five and Six are both concerned with unemployment benefits. Chapter Five discusses them within the optimal policy framework. Attention is first concentrated on the optimal level of benefits and then on their optimal time pattern, in cases where they can vary with the duration of unemployment. Chapter Six digresses from the optimal policy format to discuss the macroeconomic role of unemployment benefits, arguing that the replacement ratio deserves a more explicit inclusion in the Keynesian income/expenditure analysis. Chapter Seven applies the optimal policy method to pension and retirement practices. The initial concern is whether or not formal pensions and retirement are theoretically justifiable as part of an optimal approach to policy. The discussion is then broadened to consider redistributive issues, within and between generations. Chapter Eight concludes...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the interaction among inequality, redistribution and economic growth. The literature proposes {{two kinds of}} connection: the so called virtuous circle which sug-gests that redistribution reduces inequality and this accelerates growth which also reduces inequality. According to this view there is no space for permanent <b>redistributive</b> <b>policies.</b> A one-time redistribution is adequate and can guarantee both less income inequality and higher growth. The second type of connection concludes that redistribution reduces inequality and this accelerates growth however economic growth tends to increase inequality. Therefore, {{there is a need}} for permanent <b>redistributive</b> <b>policies</b> that play a countercyclical role against this vicious circle. According to this approach government intervention through taxation and <b>redistributive</b> <b>policies</b> can play an active role by enhancing growth and reducing inequality. Using an Overlapping Generations model with heterogeneous agents, in a two-sector econ-omy we conclude that in the presence of credit market imperfections redistribution affects growth.

In these two studies, the government’s <b>redistributive</b> <b>policy</b> is constrained by the skilled workers’ binding downward incentive-compatibility constraint, which makes them indifferent between {{whether or not to}} mimic the unskilled workers.

As the undeserving poor would have to increase their working hours in order to mimic the deserving poor, an effective upper bound on the undeserving poor’s working hours is desirable.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{interaction}} between population demographics, the desire for intergenerational redistribution in the economy, and the optimal inflation rate in a deterministic life-cycle economy with capital. Young cohorts do not initially have any assets and wages are {{the main source of}} income; they prefer relatively low real interest rates, relatively high wages, and relatively high rates of inflation. Older generations work less and prefer higher rates of return from their savings, relatively low wages, and relatively low inflation. In the absence of intergenerational redistribution via lump-sum taxes and transfers, the constrained effi cient competitive equilibrium entails optimal distortions on relative prices. We allow the planner to use inflation to try to achieve the optimal distortions. In the economy changes in the population structure are interpreted as the ability of a particular cohort to influence the <b>redistributive</b> <b>policy.</b> When the old have more influence on the <b>redistributive</b> <b>policy,</b> the economy has a relatively low steady state level of capital and a relatively low steady state rate of inflation.
