60|$|Helen <b>realized</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> Bo {{saw through}} the cowboy--that the {{ultimatum}} {{was only one}} of his tricks.|$|E
60|$|Helen <b>realized</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> {{whatever}} his calling, hunter or wanderer or hermit, {{he was not}} uneducated, even if he appeared illiterate.|$|E
60|$|A faint flush stole {{into her}} anæmic. One <b>realized</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> under {{different}} conditions {{she might have}} been pretty. Her face was no longer expressionless.|$|E
50|$|Gorham <b>realizes</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> Farley {{must be the}} murderer. Six months {{working in}} Titan's hydrogen/methane {{atmosphere}} had accustomed Farley to using jets of oxygen to create combustion. He had booby-trapped the oxygen cylinder from force of recent habit, <b>then</b> <b>realized</b> his mistake and also booby-trapped the hydrogen cylinder. Davenport is convinced, and orders Farley's arrest.|$|R
6000|$|Therefore, as capital increases, more labor can be employed. When [...] the Pittsburg rioters, in 1877, {{destroyed}} property, or {{the product}} [...] of past labor, {{they did not}} <b>realize</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> that property might, [...] but now could never again, be employed for productive purposes, [...] and thereby support laborers.|$|R
5000|$|Sharzer was all set for {{a career}} in academia, until she took a summer film course at New York Film Academy. <b>Realizing</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> she was [...] "not meant for academia," [...] Sharzer left Berkeley and {{enrolled}} in NYU Film School. In 2002, she won the school’s Wasserman Award for her graduate thesis film, The Wormhole.|$|R
60|$|Elizabeth {{felt the}} color rising slowly to her cheek. She <b>realized</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> {{if she had}} thrown down the gage of battle {{the young man had}} lost no time in taking it up.|$|E
6000|$|Lenore <b>realized</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> {{she would}} have to confide in Jake or run the risk of having {{violence}} done to Nash. So she nodded wisely at the cowboy and winked mischievously, and, taking advantage of Anderson's entering the car, she whispered in Jake's ear: [...] "I'm finding out things. Tell you--later." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who does not?" [...] she flashed back at him, and she rose, {{feeling as}} if drawn by a {{powerful}} current. She <b>realized</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> she must be prepared any moment to be overwhelmed by the inevitable climax of this meeting. But she prayed {{for a little more}} time. She fought her emotions.|$|E
5|$|The Grinch <b>realizes</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> Christmas is {{something}} more than its trappings. The book criticizes the commercialization of Christmas and satirizes those who exploit the holiday. The tale was adapted into a 1966 short animated film for television with a screenplay by Seuss and narration by Boris Karloff. Later adaptations include a Broadway musical and a feature film in 2000 starring Jim Carrey.|$|R
2500|$|At {{first she}} denies this, then in panic admits {{it in order}} not to have to provide a sample of her handwriting. Michael, horrified, <b>realizes</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> Hanna has a secret that she refuses to reveal at any cost—that she is illiterate. This {{explains}} many of Hanna's actions: her refusal of the promotion that would have removed her from the responsibility of supervising these women and also the panic she carried her entire life over being discovered.|$|R
50|$|Colman <b>then</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> {{one can be}} rich {{without any}} money (Curtayne-Linnane).|$|R
6000|$|A faint {{sound like}} the {{rattling}} of thin chains diverted Madeline's attention. At first she imagined it {{was made by the}} telegraph wires. Then she heard a step. The door swung wide; a tall man entered, and with him came the clinking rattle. She <b>realized</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> the sound came from his spurs. The man was a cowboy, and his entrance recalled vividly to her that of Dustin Farnum in the first act of [...] "The Virginian." ...|$|E
60|$|Helen listened {{again for}} the roar of wind. It seemed to come on a breath of air that fanned her cheek and softly blew Bo's curls, and it was stronger. But it died out presently, only to come again, and still stronger. Helen <b>realized</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> the sound was that of an {{approaching}} storm. Her heavy eyelids almost refused to stay open, and she knew if she let them close she would instantly drop to sleep. And she wanted to hear the storm-wind in the pines.|$|E
60|$|She {{paused for}} a moment to take breath. I <b>realized</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> the woman whom I had known was {{something}} of a fraud, a puppet hung out with the rags of a European manner, according to the study and observation of the shrewd, little lady who pulled the strings. It was Mrs. Van Reinberg of London and Paris whom I had met upon the steamer; it was Mrs. Van Reinberg of New York who was talking to me now, and she was speaking in her own language.|$|E
25|$|It was <b>then</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> {{the sport}} had been {{transformed}} into one's livelihood.|$|R
5000|$|When Lily and Ted {{reach his}} house, Lily realizes that Marshall's mother {{is trying to}} {{convince}} Marshall to not go to Italy, after seeing some Facebook photos. When Lily sees a [...] "For Sale" [...] sign, Ted reveals that he's moving to Chicago because he cannot be around Robin after the wedding. Marshall calls Lily for a final time, saying {{that no matter what}} happens, he will move to Italy with her. After this, Marshall receives a call, saying that his application to be a judge has been granted. Marshall <b>realizes</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> he can't join Lily in Italy.|$|R
50|$|Aiomun-Kondi <b>then</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> {{there would}} always be {{corruption}} in the world, and moved on.|$|R
6000|$|Lenore slowly {{stepped to}} that shadowed spot beyond the {{curtains}} {{where she had}} told her love to Dorn; and there she stood, praying and fighting for strength to let him go, for power to conceal her pain. The one great thing {{she could do was}} to show him that she would not {{stand in the way of}} his duty to himself. She <b>realized</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> if he had told her sooner, if he were going to remain one more hour at [...] "Many Waters," [...] she would break down and beseech him not to leave her.|$|E
60|$|Then the {{war broke}} out. South Carolina seceded in December, 1860 and other States followed. Clemens was in New Orleans in January, 1861, when Louisiana seceded, and his boat {{was put into}} the Confederate service and sent up the Red River. His {{occupation}} gone, he took steamer for the North--the last one before the blockade closed. A blank cartridge was fired at them from Jefferson Barracks when they reached St. Louis, {{but they did not}} understand the signal, and kept on. Presently a shell carried away part of the pilot-house and considerably disturbed its inmates. They <b>realized,</b> <b>then,</b> <b>that</b> war had really begun.|$|E
60|$|Majesty {{had broken}} into a trot when a shrill whistle rent the air. The horse leaped and, {{wheeling}} so swiftly that he nearly unseated Madeline, he charged back straight for the mesquites. Madeline spoke to him, cried angrily at him, pulled with all her strength upon the bridle, but was helplessly unable to stop him. He whistled a piercing blast. Madeline <b>realized</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> Stewart, his old master, had called him and that nothing could turn him. She gave up trying, and attended to the urgent need of intercepting mesquite boughs that Majesty thrashed into motion. The horse thumped into an aisle between the trees and, stopping before Stewart, whinnied eagerly.|$|E
50|$|Fifteen years later, Roxane {{lives at}} a convent, {{mourning}} {{the loss of}} Christian. Cyrano comes to her every day, delivering his Gazette, or news from the outside world. Cyrano comes to visit her, and tell her news, and Roxane notices blood on his head. Cyrano confesses {{that he has been}} brutally beaten by one of his enemies, and is dying. Before he dies, Cyrano requests he read Christian's farewell letter to her one last time. Roxane noitices that Cyrano is not reading the letter, but he is reciting it. She <b>realizes</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> it was Cyrano she loved all along. Cyrano dies in Roxane's arms.|$|R
50|$|Kitty finally {{makes it}} clear to Hugh she married twice out of love for him. He, however, does not {{consider}} the relationship {{as anything other than}} business. The Earl of Carstairs, freshly returned from India, gets Kitty to agree to marry him. Hugh finally comes to his senses, but is unable to convince Kitty to break her engagement. Finally, he brings Old Meg to see her and Carstairs. Kitty tells Meg to tell all she knows about her old life, but Carstairs' love is unshaken. Defeated, Hugh genuinely congratulates Kitty and leaves. She <b>realizes</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> she will always love him and goes after him.|$|R
50|$|Richard gets a {{visit from}} the {{commander}} in chief of the Keltan army who says he is very concerned about the fate of his country, as, with the death of the Duchess Lumholtz, there could be bloody war of succession. So the general asks Richard to appoint a king for the Keltons and he responds by choosing Kahlan as Queen of Kelton. To the astonishment of Richard the general knows that Kahlan is the Mother Confessor and also the Mord-Sith are aware; Richard <b>realizes,</b> <b>then,</b> <b>that</b> the spell that protected Kahlan has dissolved and decides to send his soldiers to look for and to make sure she's okay.|$|R
60|$|Smith-Oldwick and {{the girl}} saw the two nearing each other. The former swore softly beneath his breath while he nervously fingered the pitiful weapon at his hip. The girl pressed her open palms to her cheeks as she leaned forward in stony-eyed, horror-stricken silence. While she had every {{confidence}} in the prowess of the godlike creature who thus dared brazenly to face the king of beasts, she had no false conception of what must certainly happen when they met. She had seen Tarzan battle with Sheeta, the panther, and she had <b>realized</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> powerful as the man was, it was only agility, cunning, and chance that placed him upon anywhere near an equal footing with his savage adversary, {{and that of the}} three factors upon his side chance was the greatest.|$|E
6000|$|... [After {{taking charge}} of his new regiment, Grant was encamped a short time near Springfield. A month was spent in drill and discipline; {{when the time came}} for the {{mustering}} into the national service of those who were willing to enter, the regiment went in as a body. July 3d he was ordered to Quincy, Mo. While here he was ordered to move against Colonel Tom Harris, a Confederate, who was encamped on a creek with high hills on both sides. Grant approached the place with much uneasiness, expecting to find Harris and his men drawn up ready to meet him. Instead, they had fled. He <b>realized</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> Harris had had quite as much fear of him as he had had of Harris. This experience was a valuable lesson to him; remembering it, he never again felt trepidation before encountering an enemy.] ...|$|E
60|$|Shefford strode {{away into}} a secluded {{corner of the}} Square, where in the shade and quiet of the trees he {{suffered}} a storm of heart and mind. During that short or long time--he {{had no idea how}} long--the Indian remained with him. He never lost the feeling of Nas Ta Bega close beside him. When the period of acute pain left him and some order began to replace the tumult in his mind he felt in Nas Ta Bega the same quality--silence or strength or help--that he had learned to feel in the deep cañon and the lofty crags. He <b>realized</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> the Indian was indeed a brother. And Shefford needed him. What he had to fight was more fatal than suffering and love--it was hate rising out of the unsuspected dark gulf of his heart--the instinct to kill--the murder in his soul. Only now did he come to understand Jane Withersteen's tragic story and the passion of Venters and what had made Lassiter a gun-man. The desert had transformed Shefford. The elements had entered into his muscle and bone, into the very fiber of his heart. Sun, wind, sand, cold, storm, space, stone, the poison cactus, the racking toil, the terrible loneliness--the iron of the desert man, the cruelty of the desert savage, the wildness of the mustang, the ferocity of hawk and wolf, the bitter struggle of every surviving thing--these were {{as if they had been}} melted and merged together and now made a dark and passionate stream that was his throbbing blood. He realized what he had become and gloried in it, yet there, looking on with grave and earnest eyes, was his old self, the man of reason, of intellect, of culture, who had been a good man despite the failure and shame of his life. And he gave heed to the voice of warning, of conscience. Not by revengefully seeking the Mormon who had ruined Fay Larkin and blindly dealing a wild justice could he help this unfortunate girl. This fierce, newborn strength and passion must be tempered by reason, lest he become merely elemental, a man answering wholly to primitive impulses. In the darkness of that hour he mined deep into his heart, understood himself, trembled at the thing he faced, and won his victory. He would go forth from that hour a man. He might fight, and perhaps there was death in the balance, but hate would never overthrow him.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile Jill {{has learned}} that her baby is fine and can be {{released}} the next day. She goes home to take up where her mother left off in convincing her father to accept hte money and go to Arizona. Liz has even accused him of refusing only as a punishment to Jill and urges {{him to do something}} for his daughter for once in his life. Jill has told him never to mention the baby to her again. She calls Katherine and arranges to meet her at the hospital tomorrow. But the next day the nurse puts the baby into Jill's arms and she <b>realizes</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> she can never give him up! ...|$|R
50|$|In the end, Kyung-ah {{is about}} to leave for America with Gi-joo but <b>then</b> <b>realizes</b> <b>that</b> she only loves Eun-sik.|$|R
5000|$|... "Klaustrofoobia" [...] {{is about}} a man, {{who falls in love}} with a woman and <b>then</b> <b>realizes,</b> <b>that</b> he's just a puppet for her.|$|R
5000|$|White later said, [...] "I had a devil of a {{time getting}} that scene. Curly just couldn't {{get the hang of}} it. I should have <b>realized</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> he was deteriorating even further." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1964, in high school, {{she wrote}} a musical that had a full production. She <b>realized</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> she wanted to write musical theatre, {{but it was a}} while before she {{returned}} to her calling.|$|E
50|$|Duren {{began to}} paint {{when he was}} {{diagnosed}} with polio at the age of six. To occupy their bedridden son, his parents gave him crayons and a tablet. In an interview shortly before his death, Duren said he <b>realized</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> he would be an artist.|$|E
6000|$|He {{looks into}} her face; <b>then,</b> <b>realizing</b> <b>that</b> she means it, [...] {{suddenly}} {{bends down to}} her fingers, and puts his lips to them.|$|R
50|$|We {{discover}} psychoanalysis to {{have been}} superseded by tyrannous sadism, practiced by unprincipled men, themselves evidently in the last stages of dementia. This, then, {{is the end of}} the trail for psychoanalysis—a world of failure and brutality. Today men who call themselves analysts are merrily sawing out patients’ brains, shocking them with murderous drugs, striking them with high voltages, burying them underneath mounds of ice, placing them in restraints, “sterilizing” them sexually and generally conducting themselves much as their patients would were they given the chance. It is up to us to <b>realize,</b> <b>then,</b> <b>that</b> psychoanalysis in its pure practice is dead the moment the spirit of humanity in which Freud developed the work is betrayed by the handing over of a patient to the merciless misconduct which passes today for treatment.|$|R
5000|$|In Tom and Lamont's hotel, Tom finds a {{newspaper}} detailing his own death. He <b>realizes</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> Glen Upshaw is the killer, not Barbara. He killed Jeanine after she threatened to expose his political corruption {{and the fact}} that he had made Gloria, his daughter, then a little girl, his sex slave. When Anton was blamed for the crime, Magda, Tom's grandmother, found out what a horrible person Glen was, and in a depressive state, waded into the lake and drowned herself. Tom and Lamont write I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE over and over on pieces of paper, copying Barbara Deane's notes, and mail them to Glen in order to [...] "rattle his cage". Lamont lends Tom [...] "The Divided Man", a novelization of the Blue Rose murders written by Timothy Underhill.|$|R
