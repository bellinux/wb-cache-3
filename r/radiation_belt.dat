5|$|Concerns {{had been}} raised that the <b>radiation</b> <b>belt</b> {{produced}} in orbit by the recent Operation Dominic nuclear tests would be dangerous to manned space missions, but an extensive study announced in early September declared that {{it was safe to}} fly. While the outside of the capsule was expected to receive a dosage of around 500 röntgens, the study concluded that shielding and the effect of the spacecraft structure would reduce this to around 8 röntgens experienced by the astronaut, well within established tolerance limits.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede is the Solar System's largest {{moon and}} the Solar System's only known moon with a magnetosphere, {{but this does not}} shield it from cosmic {{radiation}} to a noteworthy degree, because it is overshadowed by Jupiter's magnetic field. Ganymede receives about 0.08Sv (8rem) of radiation per day. Callisto is farther from Jupiter's strong <b>radiation</b> <b>belt</b> and subject to only 0.0001Sv (0.01rem) a day. For comparison, the average amount of radiation taken on Earth by a living organism is about 0.0024Sv per year; the highest natural radiation levels on Earth are recorded around Ramsar hot springs at about 0.26Sv per year.|$|E
5|$|Interplanetary space {{contains}} {{the magnetic field}} generated by the Sun. There are also magnetospheres generated by planets such as Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury and the Earth that have their own magnetic fields. These are shaped by {{the influence of the}} solar wind into the approximation of a teardrop shape, with the long tail extending outward behind the planet. These magnetic fields can trap particles from the solar wind and other sources, creating belts of magnetic particles such as the Van Allen <b>radiation</b> <b>belt.</b> Planets without magnetic fields, such as Mars, have their atmospheres gradually eroded by the solar wind.|$|E
30|$|The {{large number}} of high-energy charged {{particles}} in the <b>radiation</b> <b>belts</b> can cause the electronic devices mounted on spacecraft to fail and hamper accurate measurements of the charged particles inside the belts. Therefore, it {{has been difficult to}} observe and characterize the <b>radiation</b> <b>belts,</b> particularly in the center. Consequently, the questions of when, where, how, and why the high-energy particles in the <b>radiation</b> <b>belts</b> are generated and lost have remained a scientific mystery. Indeed, the physical process of generating relativistic electrons in the <b>radiation</b> <b>belts</b> is still quite controversial. The exploration of energization and radiation in geospace (ERG) satellite launched in 2016 was intended to solve this mystery of the <b>radiation</b> <b>belts.</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{tutorial}} introduces {{students to}} Earth's <b>radiation</b> <b>belts,</b> {{also known as}} the Van Allen Belts after their discoverer. Topics include the structure of the <b>radiation</b> <b>belts</b> and the currents of particles trapped in Earth's magnetic fields, their properties, and where they come from. There is also a set of classroom activities for exploring <b>radiation</b> <b>belts</b> and solar storms and a set of illustrations and movies of the belts. Other materials include news items related to the <b>radiation</b> <b>belts,</b> recordings of 'space sounds' related to the influence of lightning on Earth's magnetic field, and a frequently-asked-questions feature.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{electron}} and proton radiation on spacecraft which will {{operate in the}} trapped <b>radiation</b> <b>belts</b> of the planet Jupiter are considered, and the techniques and results of the testing and simulation used in the radiation effects program at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory are discussed.

5|$|The {{extent of}} Earth's {{magnetic}} field in space defines the magnetosphere. Ions and electrons {{of the solar}} wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail. Because the velocity of the solar wind {{is greater than the}} speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind. Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates; the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field, and the Van Allen <b>radiation</b> <b>belt</b> are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{permanent}} {{magnetic moment}} carves {{a part of}} space around Ganymede, creating a tiny magnetosphere embedded inside that of Jupiter; {{it is the only}} moon in the Solar System known to possess the feature. Its diameter is 4–5 RG (RG = 2,631.2km). The Ganymedian magnetosphere has a region of closed field lines located below 30° latitude, where charged particles (electrons and ions) are trapped, creating a kind of <b>radiation</b> <b>belt.</b> The main ion species in the magnetosphere is single ionized oxygen—O+—which fits well with Ganymede's tenuous oxygen atmosphere. In the polar cap regions, at latitudes higher than 30°, magnetic field lines are open, connecting Ganymede with Jupiter's ionosphere. In these areas, the energetic (tens and hundreds of kiloelectronvolt) electrons and ions have been detected, which may cause the auroras observed around the Ganymedian poles. In addition, heavy ions continuously precipitate on Ganymede's polar surface, sputtering and darkening the ice.|$|E

30|$|The XEP has {{initiated}} high-energy electron measurements in the Earth’s <b>radiation</b> <b>belts</b> since March 24, 2017. We {{confirmed that the}} XEP achieves the expected observation performance as designed, and the XEP has successfully captured dynamic variations of relativistic electron fluxes in the <b>radiation</b> <b>belts</b> during magnetic storms. The XEP is providing us with information {{on the behavior of}} MeV range electrons. The measurement of the XEP will contribute to better understanding of physical mechanisms behind such dynamic variation of the <b>radiation</b> <b>belts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The term Van Allen belts refers {{specifically}} to the <b>radiation</b> <b>belts</b> surrounding Earth; however, similar <b>radiation</b> <b>belts</b> have been discovered around other planets. The Sun does not support long-term <b>radiation</b> <b>belts,</b> as it lacks a stable, global, dipole field. The Earth's atmosphere limits the belts' particles to regions above 200-1,000 km, (124-620 miles) while the belts do not extend past 8 Earth radii RE. The belts are confined to a volume which extends about 65° {{on either side of}} the celestial equator.|$|R

25|$|The {{innermost}} {{region of}} the magnetosphere near the rings is generally devoid of energetic ions and electrons because they are absorbed by ring particles. Saturn, however, has the second <b>radiation</b> <b>belt</b> discovered by Cassini in 2004 and located just inside the innermost D Ring. This belt probably consists of energetic charged particles formed via the CRAND process or of ionized energetic neutral atoms coming from the main <b>radiation</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E
25|$|Objects in LEO {{encounter}} atmospheric drag from {{gases in}} the thermosphere (approximately 80–500km up) or exosphere (approximately 500km and up), depending on orbit height. Due to atmospheric drag, satellites do not usually orbit below 300km. Objects in LEO, orbit Earth between the denser part of the atmosphere and below the inner Van Allen <b>radiation</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} {{advantage is}} that considerably less launch energy is needed to place a spacecraft into a Molniya orbit than into a geostationary orbit. Disadvantages are that, {{as opposed to a}} spacecraft in a geostationary orbit, the ground station needs a steerable antenna to track the spacecraft and that the spacecraft will pass the Van Allen <b>radiation</b> <b>belt</b> four times per day.|$|E
50|$|<b>Radiation</b> <b>belts</b> exist {{around other}} planets and moons {{in the solar}} system that have {{magnetic}} fields powerful enough to sustain them. To date, most of these <b>radiation</b> <b>belts</b> have been poorly mapped. The Voyager Program (namely Voyager 2) only nominally confirmed the existence of similar belts around Uranus and Neptune.|$|R
40|$|A {{simplified}} {{model of}} the Jovian magnetosphere consists of a thermal plasma with superimposed <b>radiation</b> <b>belts.</b> The model is derived using the following assumptions: (1) The <b>radiation</b> <b>belts</b> are located in a cavity of the Jovian magnetosphere and the field geometry in that cavity is a pure dipole. (2) The conductivity in the Jovian ionosphere {{is large enough to}} force the magnetosphere to corotate. (3) The population of electrons in the <b>radiation</b> <b>belts</b> is in a steady state, and the observational data are representative of such average conditions. (4) The nonthermal continuum is produced by the synchrotron radiation of trapped relativistic electrons...|$|R

25|$|Explorer 1 was {{launched}} on January 31, 1958 at 22:48 Eastern Time (equal to February 1, 03:48 UTC) atop the first Juno booster from LC-26 at the Cape Canaveral Missile Annex, Florida. It {{was the first}} spacecraft to detect the Van Allen <b>radiation</b> <b>belt,</b> returning data until its batteries were exhausted after nearly four months. It remained in orbit until 1970, and has been followed by more than 90 scientific spacecraft in the Explorer series.|$|E
25|$|Saturn has {{relatively}} weak radiation belts, because energetic particles are {{absorbed by the}} moons and particulate material orbiting the planet. The densest (main) <b>radiation</b> <b>belt</b> lies between the inner edge of the Enceladus gas torus at 3.5Rs and {{the outer edge of}} the A Ring at 2.3Rs. It contains protons and relativistic electrons with energies from hundreds of kiloelectronvolts (keV) to as high as tens of megaelectronvolts (MeV) and possibly other ions. Beyond 3.5Rs the energetic particles are absorbed by the neutral gas and their numbers drop, although less energetic particles with energies in the range of hundreds keV appear again beyond 6Rs—these are the same particles that contribute to the ring current. The electrons in the main belt probably originate in the outer magnetosphere or Solar wind, from which they are transported by the diffusion and then adiabatically heated. However, the energetic protons consist of two populations of particles. The first population with energies of less than about 10 MeV has the same origin as electrons, while the second one with the maximum flux near 20 MeV results from the interaction of cosmic rays with solid material present in the Saturnian system (so called cosmic ray albedo neutron decay process—CRAND). The main <b>radiation</b> <b>belt</b> of Saturn is strongly influenced by interplanetary solar wind disturbances.|$|E
25|$|The Van Allen <b>radiation</b> <b>belt</b> is a torus {{of energy}} charged {{particles}} around Earth, {{held in place}} by Earth's magnetic field. On the sun side, it is compressed because of the solar wind and on the other side, it is elongated to around three earth radii. This creates a cavity called the Chapman Ferraro Cavity, in which the Van Allen radiation belts reside. The existence of the belt was confirmed by the Explorer 1 and Explorer 3 missions in early 1958, under Dr. James Van Allen at the University of Iowa.|$|E

The <b>radiation</b> <b>belts</b> intensify or weaken over time {{as part of the}} much larger space weather system driven by the energy and material that erupt off the sun's surface and fill the entire Solar System.|$|R
25|$|Similarly, {{cosmic rays}} cause higher {{background}} exposure in astronauts than in humans {{on the surface}} of Earth. Astronauts in low orbits, such as in the International Space Station or the Space Shuttle, are partially shielded by the magnetic field of the Earth, but also suffer from the Van Allen <b>radiation</b> <b>belt</b> which accumulates cosmic rays and results from the Earth's magnetic field. Outside low Earth orbit, as experienced by the Apollo astronauts who traveled to the Moon, this background radiation is much more intense, and represents a considerable obstacle to potential future long term human exploration of the moon or Mars.|$|E

Because of the greater photographic resolution allowed by a closer approach, most observations of the moons, rings, magnetic fields, and the <b>radiation</b> <b>belt</b> environment of the Jovian system were made during the 48-hour period that bracketed the closest approach. Voyager 1 finished photographing the Jovian system in April 1979.|$|E

By consensus, any region beyond cislunar space is referred to as deep space.

Callisto's rotation is tidally locked to its orbit around Jupiter, so that the same hemisphere always faces inward; Jupiter appears to stand nearly still in Callisto's sky. It is less affected by Jupiter's magnetosphere than the other inner satellites because of its more remote orbit, located just outside Jupiter's main <b>radiation</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E
