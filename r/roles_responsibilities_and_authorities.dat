40|$|I explore {{issues of}} {{communication}} among career civil servants and political appointees {{in the government}} of a large democracy, the United States. Influenced by the work of Cooks (2000) and Stacey (2007), I use narrative inquiry to explore micro-interactions of which I am a part. My inquiry shows that, in contrast to the mainstream 'sender receiver' model of communication, people use processes of ambiguity and revealing and concealing in their ordinary interactions. I claim that such processes are not 'errors' in the transmission of a signal, but are essential processes through which people of diverse interests reach agreement among themselves that enable them to get along with each other (Eisenberg, 2007). I assert that such processes are inevitable because messages cannot be 'sent' with fully predictable results due, in part, to processes of revealing and concealing. Influenced by Stacey (2007), I argue that governing occurs among people interacting with each other in ordinary ways in small groups. Such interactions include telephone calls, emails, face to face meetings, and hallway conversations as well as large group meetings and events. I also assert that g'overning occurs in minute, frequently ignored aspects of such interactions, such as pauses in conversations. I maintain that, in such activities, participants consider numerous factors before deciding their next steps, such as issues of influence, authority, organizational position, personal need, political preference, and issues of 'face,' image, and self-presentation. I argue that, although such activities are influenced by others, they are not fully controlled by others. Therefore, my thesis contrasts to 'mainstream' theories oforganizational behavior (Weber, 1947; Merton, 1949; Parsons, 1951; Simon, 1997), because I argue that patterns of interaction cannot be fully controlled or 'designed' in advance. The assertion is based on my research finding that processes of revealing and concealing pervade interactions and influence ongoing patterns that emerge. I address processes of governing and observe that, in the large democracy I have explored, they are influenced by patterns of interdependence in which government employees are paradoxically related to the head of government. For example, employees are voters who playa role in selecting the leader whose 'agendas' they are expected to implement. Therefore, such paradoxical relations have a 'flattening' effect on organizational relationships within the bureaucracy; the President is 'playing' to the civil servants as voters {{at the same time he}} is directing their work. I take the position that, in the U. S. government, processes of ambiguity are fostered by the country's Constitutional separation of powers, as a result of which no one, including the President, has ultimate power. As a result, ambiguity pervades interactions among officials including the President's own appointees, career civil servants, and elected officials. Due to the ambiguity and paradoxical power relations mentioned above, I show that, even in a large government headed by a visible, powerful elected official such as the President, no one is fully in control. I maintain that the exercise of discretion is critical to the successful development of employee influence, whether the employee is a political appointee, career civil servant, or elected official. I argue that the exercise of discretion by the government employee is critical to the navigation of ambiguous <b>roles,</b> <b>responsibilities,</b> <b>and</b> <b>authorities</b> and is related to influence, which is political. As a result, I assert that the exercise ofdiscretion, including processes of ambiguity, is critical to governing. My contributions include clarifying the importance of ambiguity in governing, and showing that processes of ambiguity and revealing and concealing are pervasive in human interaction. Therefore, my work contributes to the development of a theory ofcomplex responsive processes (Stacey, 2007) by showing that such processes are instrumental in choices people make and therefore, influence predictability, control, and the patterning of interactions.

This is evidenced by the fact that locally the relationships between water users, differently scaled state agencies, and broader networks greatly determined how water users associations negotiated the irrigation management transfer program as well as the development of new water policies.

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{direction for}} every activity in Kuteb land revolve round the theocratic {{role of the}} Kwe Kukwen, Akwen and Council of elders called Ndufu who represent the major known sub clans and extended families. Kukwen is the Chief-Priest located in Mbarikam or Ikam or Teekum and the Akwen are the minor priests who are heads of the other clans. This practice started with Kuteb himself as the paramount chief priest / King of the Kutebs. The Kwe Kukwen may be chosen from any clan. However, he must, on his election, come to reside in Teekum (Mbarikam Hill) being the ward of Likam and the Headquarters of the Kuteb Nation The traditional Kuteb political system is thus federal in nature. Even though the Kutebs recognised the seniority of Likam, the other clans had some autonomy to exercise powers of maintaining peace, protecting and achieving the interest of their respective clan members. However, such power ended where collective interest and programmes of the entire nation was to begin and where the settlement of disputes between individuals and clans were brought before the Kwe Kukwen.

This article describes a survey conducted of 200 department heads to determine job performance. Results show that the role is poorly defined and multifaceted, and most department heads lack adequate prepa-ration. Suggestions for improvement are offered. The role of the secondary school department head is largely unde-fined, open to interpretation, and multifaceted in nature. Principals and central office staff often have difficulty agreeing on the <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> for department heads.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the perceptions of Saudi high school teachers and their students about cooperative learning. It also investigates teachers’ classroom practices based on the five cooperative learning (CL) principles (Johnson & Johnson, 2014). Most empirical studies in the field focus on assessment instead of examining attitudes and perceptions. The improvement of teachers and learners’ understanding of CL and its implementation is, however, unlikely to be achieved if researchers are only concerned with achievement. Moreover, only a few studies have been conducted in the Middle East and in traditional lecture-style contexts, such as Saudi Arabia, where CL is still considered a new teaching method. The current study was conducted in one state all-male high school in Saudi Arabia. The participants were eight teachers who received in-service teacher training on using CL based on Johnson and Johnson’s model and who have been using CL for more than one year, along with their 97 participant-students in Years 10, 11 and 12. The data comes from individual semi-structured interviews, a questionnaire and classroom observations. The findings indicate that all teachers and the majority of students in this investigation showed positive attitudes towards CL and prefer it to lecture-style lessons. The findings suggest that training in cooperative learning is important to help teachers change their practice and their perceptions of classroom <b>roles,</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>authority.</b> However, there are considerable initial challenges when teachers change from lecture-style to CL. Furthermore, there are some challenges and difficulties in implementing CL in the Saudi context, such as curricula and the assessment system.

It could also create communities of learning among students, thus helping them with their academic and social learning and shaping their identities...|$|R

Hazards are controlled within the requirements set forth in the reference section {{at the end of this}} report. It is the intent of the WVDP Occupational Safety and Health Program to assure that each employee is provided with a safe and healthy work environment. This report shows the logical path toward ensuring employee safety in planning work at the WVDP. In general, planning work to be performed safely includes: combining requirements from specific programs such as occupational safety, industrial hygiene, radiological control, nuclear safety, fire safety, environmental protection, etc.; including WVDP employees in the safety decision-making processes; pre-planning using safety support re-sources; and integrating the safety processes into the work instructions. Safety management principles help to define the path forward for the WVDP Occupational Safety <b>and</b> Health Program. <b>Roles,</b> <b>responsibilities,</b> <b>and</b> <b>authority</b> of personnel stem from these ideals. WVNS and its subcontractors are guided by the following fundamental safety management principles: ''Protection of the environment, workers, and the public is the highest priority. The safety and well-being of our employees, the public, and the environment must never be compromised in the aggressive pursuit of results and accomplishment of work product. A graded approach to environment, safety, and health in design, construction, operation, maintenance, and deactivation is incorporated to ensure the protection of the workers, the public, and the environment. '' These principles are demonstrated through: Conducting all activities in an atmosphere of trust and confidence based on open, honest, and responsive communication. Using innovative and effective approaches to risk identification and management. Applying a systematic approach to planning and execution of all activities that affect the environment, safety, and health through use of the Integrated Environment, Safety, and Health Management System.

40|$|This {{paper is}} the final report of a {{research}} project spanning three years, exploring three field locations and capturing the stories of forty (plus) housing workers. Using an ethnographic research approach, this paper provides an account of how housing workers use language and stories {{to make sense of}} their challenging and changing work. First hand accounts (2 ̆ 7 stories 2 ̆ 7) about everyday housing work frame the data in this paper, explaining how housing workers in Victoria have experienced and made sense of the shift from public housing as 2 ̆ 7 affordable housing for the working poor 2 ̆ 7 to 2 ̆ 7 housing of last resort for the most vulnerable and needy members of the community 2 ̆ 7. Using a number of composite stories, this paper provides the reader with a glimpse into the work of public housing staff, transporting the reader from the relativley static world of policy and procedure to the more colourful world of tenants with 2 ̆ 7 high and complex 2 ̆ 7 needs, 2 ̆ 7 wicked 2 ̆ 7 problems, weary staff and the daily reality of organisational change. A unique feature of this research is the comparison of how different workers use their stories to build a range of 2 ̆ 7 socially constructed realities 2 ̆ 7 around the housing work and its wicked problems. With a few exceptions (Saugeres, 1999, Howe, 1998, Clapham et al., 2000, Darcy, 1999) the voices of frontline staff are largley absent from contemporary housing literature. In this paper, I use the stories of frontline staff to build a comparative case study of the socially constructed realities for frontline staff and the corresponding realities of the managers at head office (and vice versa). This 2 ̆ 7 same problem, different perspective 2 ̆ 7 approach allows the reader to better understand how the same problem is understood and approached in different ways, depending on the individual 2 ̆ 7 s organisational <b>role,</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>authority.</b> Using stories about 2 ̆ 7 working with problem tenants 2 ̆ 7, 2 ̆ 7 collecting rental arrears from the poor and marginalised 2 ̆ 7, maintaining old, neglected properties 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 coping with organisational change 2 ̆ 7, this paper illustrates how the shifting (and sometimes contradictory) construction of housing problems has meant that the organisation has long struggled to devise and implement sustainable remedies to these problems. The following pages describe how the problem identified in the Housing Office Review (and experienced in the daily work of the 2 ̆ 7 modern day 2 ̆ 7 housing worker) are simply a contemporary manifestation of  2 ̆ 7 age old public housing issues 2 ̆ 7. This paper describes and explains how housing staff have long used narrative to make sense of their often difficult work and ultimately, how they understand and experience a major process of operational policy change associated with the shift from 2 ̆ 7 public 2 ̆ 7 housing to 2 ̆ 7 welfare 2 ̆ 7 housing. <br /...|$|R

Increased {{attention is}} being given to the promise of co-management {{as a means of}} achieving sustainable fish stocks {{while at the same time}} providing benefits to those dependent on the fishery. At the same time, the view that co-management represents a continuum between state or user control is being replaced by the view that co-management is better represented by more complex networks comprised of a variety of stakeholders who may each assume different <b>roles,</b> <b>responsibilities</b> <b>and</b> levels of <b>authority.</b> Experiences from research funded through the UK Department for International Development’s Fisheries Management Science Programme (FMSP) have highlighted the potential role of researchers, a stakeholder group not traditionally given an active role in management, within such networks. Often in fisheries management the approach taken has been to separate research from management decision-making or to research and then manage, with scientific advice being provided to government agencies. However, in co-managed fisheries there is a danger that this can lead to advice that does not reflect the needs and constraints of those dependent on the fishery and/or advice that is not available to all the stakeholder groups involved in making decisions. The FMSP experiences suggest that there are many benefits from involving researchers more actively in the management process. This not only makes information generation (the traditional role of the researcher) more relevant but can also lead to improvements in the sharing of information so that decisions are made on the basis of a common understanding amongst stakeholder groups. Management uncertainties can be reduced and, at the same time, management strategies can be developed that better meet the objectives of those dependent upon, or affected by, the fishery...|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{the global}} economy require swift action by organisations to respond to new demands, as such the {{organisational}} design of choice within the last decade has been the matrix structure. Flaws with the matrix organisation design are widely cited, but the prolific adoption leads to a conclusion that the benefits must outweigh these flaws. This research focuses on the interpersonal challenges arising from the dual reporting structure which leads to unclear <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> <b>and</b> ambiguous <b>authority.</b> Given that managers within the matrix structure have different goals, how do they influence project team members to execute project responsibilities which align with organisational goals? The objective of this research was to uncover how the dyadic relationships in a dual leader reporting structure, employed in a matrix organisation affect work attitudes. The research conducted was quantitative and descriptive in design. The outcomes of the literature review were used as input into the questionnaire development which was aligned with the research objectives. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to employees operating within matrix structures in a large multinational company operating within the energy and chemical industry. Quantitative data from 148 project personnel was collected and analysed. Individual leader member relationships were strong predictors of certain work attitudes. A stronger quality of relationship between the project personnel and project manager showed a lower role ambiguity whereas a stronger quality of relationship with the functional manager leads to a greater fulfilment of basic psychological needs (competence, autonomy and relatedness) and higher job satisfaction. Furthermore the alignment and misalignment between perceived leader member exchanges between the two managers was able to explain variances in outcomes beyond that of a single leader member exchange. The alignment between project personnel and project manager, and project personnel and functional manager were associated with perceived basic psychological needs and job satisfaction such that these outcomes are higher when alignment is high rather than low. When alignment is high it can be shown that role ambiguity is the lowest.
