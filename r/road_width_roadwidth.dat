40|$|AbstractThis paper aims {{to assess}} the {{characteristics}} of red light violations in Tabuk city of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The paper also analyzes the effect of intersection characteristics, such as geometric design, control system and location, on number of violations. Data on traffic characteristics and violations, intersection geometric design (<b>road</b> <b>width,</b> number of lanes, speed) were collected at 38 intersections in Tabuk using video cameras. Statistical analysis reveals that number of approaches, speed, <b>road</b> <b>width,</b> speed on cross <b>road,</b> and <b>width</b> of cross <b>road</b> significantly affects red light violation. Regression analysis implies that <b>road</b> <b>width,</b> red time and speed {{are the most important}} factors affecting red light violation...|$|R

40|$|Safety of any {{particular}} Road way facility cannot be attributed to set of parameters specific to a certain domain. Unsignalized intersections are no exceptions, thus, making them an important area of study. This paper {{presents the results of}} the analysis of four parameters, namely <b>road</b> <b>width,</b> traffic control, lane marking and landuse; and their sub-class on the safety of unsignalized intersections. The raw accident data was obtained from MIROS (Malaysian Institute of Road Safety Research). It was then reduced for descriptive analysis. Hypothesis testing was performed to assess the significance of all parameters and severity analysis was done to accomplish micro scale examination of each sub-class. The results show that landuse and lane marking are statistically significant. They are important variables to predict accidents whereas traffic control and <b>road</b> <b>width</b> are not significant. Intersections located in city with single line lane marking having no control and major <b>road</b> <b>width</b> greater than 9 meters were found to have the highest severity indices...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{describes}} an experimental design technique {{for determining the}} optimum surface finish and dimensional accuracy of a part built by the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) process. The design investigates {{the effect of the}} process parameters layer thickness, <b>road</b> <b>width,</b> raster angle and air gap on the surface finish and dimensional accuracy. Experiments were conducted using Taguchi’s design of experiments with three levels for each factor. The results are statistically analyzed to determine the significant factors and their interactions. From the ANOVA analysis, {{it was found that the}} layer thickness and <b>road</b> <b>width</b> affect the surface quality and part accuracy greatly. Raster angle has little effect. But air gap has more effect on dimensional accuracy and little effect on surface quality...|$|R
40|$|Urban road {{infrastructure}} {{is crucial in}} determining air pollution. Yet, {{little is known about}} the roles played by <b>road</b> <b>width</b> vs. <b>road</b> length. This paper attempts to fill this gap by estimating the effects of {{road infrastructure}} on 10 -micron particulate matter (PM 10) using city-level data from the People's Republic of China (PRC). Our robust modeling results show that the road density index, defined as the ratio of surface area of roads to city territory size, is negatively correlated with PM 10. More importantly, when the index of road density is decomposed into <b>road</b> <b>width</b> and <b>road</b> length components, the width is found to help reduce PM 10, whereas the length is positively correlated with PM 10, although the latter relationship is statistically insignificant...|$|R

40|$|The {{determination}} of the road geometry is a basic step in automatic road extraction. The <b>road</b> <b>width</b> {{plays an important role}} in this context. An unpaved road, by definition, is covered by bare soil and has high intensity values in relation to the neighboring features. The method for {{determination of}} <b>road</b> <b>width</b> proposed in this work is based in that spectral characteristic of the unpaved road. Therefore, the gradient is used for the detection of the borders of the road and, consequently, for the determination of its width. The proposed methodology is applied to high space resolution images. The method is evaluated with experiments using synthetic and real images. The validation of the results is accomplished through comparisons with measures obtained by visual analysis. Pages: 7143 - 714...|$|R

40|$|An urban {{passenger}} transportation {{problem is}} studied. Municipal authorities and passengers {{are regarded as}} participants in the passenger transportation system. The municipal authorities have to optimise <b>road</b> <b>width</b> and public transport frequency. The road consists of a dedicated bus lane and lanes for passenger cars. The car travel time depends {{on the number of}} road lanes and passengers’ choice of travel mode. The passengers’ goal is to minimize total travel costs, including time value. The passengers try to find the optimal ratio between public transport and cars. The conflict between municipal authorities and the passengers is described as a game theoretic model. The existence of Nash equilibrium in the model is proved. The numerical example shows the influence of the value of time and intensity of passenger flow on the equilibrium <b>road</b> <b>width</b> and public transport frequency. </p...|$|R

40|$|Maintenance {{planning}} of road pavement requires reliable estimates of roads’ lifetimes. In determining {{the lifetime of}} a road, this study combines maintenance activities and road condition measurements. The scope of the paper is to estimate lifetimes of road pavements in Sweden with time to event analysis. The model used includes effects of pavement type, road type, bearing capacity, <b>road</b> <b>width,</b> speed limit, stone size and climate zone, where the model is stratified according to traffic load. Among the nine analyzed pavement types, stone mastic had the longest expected lifetime, 32 percent longer than asphalt concrete. Among road types, ordinary roads with cable barriers had 30 percent shorter lifetime than ordinary roads. Increased speed lowered the lifetime, while increased stone size (up to 20 mm) and increased <b>road</b> <b>width</b> lengthened the lifetime. The results are of importance for life cycle cost analysis and road management...|$|R
