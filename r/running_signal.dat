30|$|Even though station overruns {{are usually}} {{associated}} with low rail adhesion (LRA), there were several incidents in the studied period which were outside the LRA season. An in-depth investigation of the locations revealed unusual positions of a <b>running</b> <b>signal.</b> Instead of being at a platform’s end, the <b>running</b> <b>signal</b> at such locations was located further down the line. The respondents indicated that while {{attention is paid to}} the <b>running</b> <b>signal</b> at the platform while coming to a scheduled stop, their perception is that the two (the <b>running</b> <b>signal</b> and the stopping position) are not related. The station overruns have been historically treated as LRA-related incidents in T&W Metro which could have led to the participant not being able to consider other factors. However, the statements were worded {{in a way that does}} not make the association with a certain driver-related incident type obvious. Most respondents have never been in a station overrun incident outside the LRA season. On the other hand, the most important factor in choosing the stopping point for a driver is the ability to interact with driver only operations (DOO) dispatch equipment.|$|E
30|$|Differences {{have been}} found between effect {{magnitude}} suggested by the historic data and driver attitudes {{for some of the}} features of system design. Namely, additional attention needs to be focused on complexity of the sidings and the depot, factors involved in SASSPaD incidents, and effects of a <b>running</b> <b>signal</b> on a stopping position. Further steps are required to investigate whether the drivers do not perceive the physical environment as something that introduces performance shaping factors or the hypotheses drawn from past the incident data analysis are incorrect. Non-intrusive psychometric methods like eye-tracking or posture sensors can be useful for this type of investigation.|$|E
30|$|For {{the problem}} that the linear scale of {{intrusion}} signals in the optical fiber pre-warning system (OFPS) is inconsistent, this paper presents a method to correct the scale. Firstly, the intrusion signals are intercepted, and an aggregate of the segments with equal length is obtained. Then, the Mellin transform (MT) is applied to convert them into the same scale. The spectral characteristics are obtained by the Fourier transform. Finally, we adopt back-propagation (BP) neural network to identify intrusion types, which takes the spectral characteristics as input. We carried out the field experiments and collected the optical fiber intrusion signals which contain the picking signal, shoveling signal, and <b>running</b> <b>signal.</b> The experimental {{results show that the}} proposed algorithm can effectively improve the recognition accuracy of the intrusion signals.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the line}} was worked on the one engine in steam principle, {{in the early years}} there were signal boxes at all the stations. The points were not locked by key on the train staff as was the later custom, and {{ordinary}} <b>running</b> <b>signals</b> indicated the lie of the points. From 1904 the signal boxes were abolished and replaced with ground frames.|$|R
30|$|Further {{investigation}} into the category A SPaD accidents in the T&W Metro showed {{a large proportion of}} these being start against a signal SPaD (SASSPaD) accidents. SASSPaD occurs when a train leaves a station against a red signal at the station’s <b>running</b> <b>signal.</b> However, the drivers did not see the difference between running signals at and between the stations. Taking into account a very low number of SPaDs compared to the overall amount of signals encountered by the metro drivers in an operational year, it is possible that many drivers even do not notice any difference. However, the drivers previously involved in category A SPaDs are more inclined to evaluate both running signals at the stations (U =  9.5, p =  0.032) and between the stations (U =  11.5, p =  0.051) less positively. Moreover, the SASSPaDs are potentially caused by non-signalling-related factors as stations have more dynamic environment than tracks between those.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSpherical {{microphone}} arrays {{are becoming}} increasingly important in acoustic signal processing systems for their applications in sound field analysis, beamforming, spatial audio, etc. The positioning of target and interfering sound sources is a crucial step {{in many of the}} above applications. Therefore, 3 D sound source localization is a highly relevant topic in the acoustic signal processing field. However, spherical microphone arrays are usually composed of many microphones and <b>running</b> <b>signal</b> processing localization methods in real time is an important issue. Some works have already shown the potential of Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) for developing high-end real-time signal processing systems. New embedded systems with integrated GPU accelerators providing low power consumption {{are becoming increasingly}} relevant. These novel systems play a very important role in the new era of smartphones and tablets, opening further possibilities to the design of high-performance compact processing systems. This paper presents a 3 D source localization system using a spherical microphone array fully implemented on an embedded GPU. The real-time capabilities of these platforms are analyzed, providing also a performance analysis of the localization system under different acoustic conditions...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis {{is related to the}} condition monitoring of rail-wheel interaction using Acoustic Emission (AE), the principle being that both normal and abnormal rolling give rise to AE, features of which are related to the mechanical intensity of the interaction and hence the stress range (or stress intensity factor range) to which sections of track is being exposed. Most of the work was carried out on a model wheel running on a model circular track, which was first characterised using a simulated source before studying the wave propagation from a continuously moving (wheel) source. Using a number of sensor arrays placed on the track, primary wave propagation characteristics such as wave speeds and attenuation coefficients and also secondary wave propagation characteristics such as reflection and transmission from and through the joint. A high speed camera was used to confirm, that wheel slip does not occur at the wheel speeds and loads of interest. A simple analytical model was derived using the measured wave propagation characteristics which describes the expected AE recorded at a track-mounted sensor as the wheel approaches and recedes. Using the analytical model, the effect of increasing wheel speed and axle load on the normal rolling signal was measured. Wheel rattling was observed, particularly at lower wheel speeds and loads, and this was eliminated in some trails by introducing a spacer. The effect of minor track defects and wheel flange rubbing on the track was also studied, where the comparison of the expected normal <b>running</b> <b>signal</b> with excursions above background allowed the locations of track defects to be identified. Finally, a set of experiments were carried out with simulated wheel defects. The signals were analysed using the principle of demodulated frequency resonance and matching to the expected pulse train spectra.. The findings of the work, along with a limited set of field tests on actual train-track interactions allows recommendations to be made for the deployment of sensors for cumulative damage monitoring on critical areas of track.

30|$|Analysis of the {{historic}} category A SPaD statistics also revealed that only 4  % of such incidents happen between Pelaw and South Hylton (mainline railway owned by Network Rail). This part of the network accounts for almost 25  % {{of the length of}} the system and 21  % of the signals in the system. This line differs {{from the rest of the}} network in several aspects. Those include bigger distances between stations and straighter alignment of the track. However, the biggest difference is use of mainline 4 -aspect signals. These mainline signals use LED lights, whereas conventional light bulbs are used in the rest of the network. Exploring mean marks for the <b>running</b> <b>signals,</b> it is possible to claim that drivers prefer the <b>running</b> <b>signals</b> on Network Rail infrastructure. The drivers also expressed concerns that the signalling on the metro infrastructure does not give as much advance warning and is more prone to overgrowth. The incident data analysis returned no correlation between approach distance and any incident type propagation. The drivers also have not reported any effect on their alertness due to the distances between stations.|$|R

40|$|The work {{addressed}} the {{greenhouse gas emission}} and electrical energy consumption of the aluminum industry. The objective {{was to provide a}} means for reducing both through the application of wireless instrumentation, coupled to mathematical modeling. Worldwide the aluminum industry consumes more electrical energy than all activities in many major countries (e. g. the UK) and emits more greenhouse gasses (e. g. than France). Most of these excesses are in the 'primary production' of aluminum; that is the conversion of aluminum oxide to metal in large electrolytic cells operating at hundreds of thousands of amps. An industry-specific GHG emission {{has been the focus of}} the work. The electrolytic cells periodically, but at irregular intervals, experience an upset condition known as an 'anode effect'. During such anode effects the cells emit fluorinated hydrocarbons (PFCs, which have a high global warming potential) at a rate far greater than in normal operation. Therefore curbing anode effects will reduce GHG emissions. Prior work had indicated that the distribution of electrical current within the cell experiences significant shifts in the minutes before an anode effect. The thrust of the present work was to develop technology that could detect and report this early warning of an anode effect so that the control computer could minimize GHG emissions. A system was developed to achieve this goal and, in collaboration with Alcoa, was tested on two cells at an Alcoa plant in Malaga, Washington. The project has also pointed to the possibility of additional improvements that could result from the work. Notable among these is an improvement in efficiency that could result in an increase in cell output at little extra operating cost. Prospects for commercialization have emerged in the form of purchase orders for further installations. The work has demonstrated that a system for monitoring the current of individual anodes in an aluminum cell is practical. Furthermore the system has been installed twice on a smelter in the US without exposing workers to hazards usually associated with <b>running</b> <b>signal</b> wires in aluminum plants. The results display the early warning of an anode effect that potentially can be used to minimize such anode effects with their excessive GHG emissions. They also point to a possible, but substantial, economic benefit that could result in improved current efficiency by anode adjustment based on individual anode current measurements...|$|E

30|$|In this study, {{the authors}} {{examined}} {{attitudes of the}} Tyne & Wear (T&W) Metro drivers towards system design-related factors and their influence on the propagation of driver-related incidents. The system design features assessed include the position of <b>running</b> <b>signals,</b> visibility of different signal types, and platform location {{in relation to the}} travelling direction. The methodology based on data gathering through a self-administered questionnaire distributed among the drivers has been used. These data have been evaluated using multivariate analysis techniques against historic data on incidents to uncover potential relationships between drivers’ perceptions and incident occurrence. The results show that the participants do not tend to consider system design factors as influential towards incident propagation. However, the analysis shows correlation between the driver responses and historical incident data such as corroboration of the increased incident propagation risks during the engineering works and the possessions.|$|R

30|$|Route {{knowledge}} {{is one of}} the most important skills of a train driver as a considerable part of their movement authority is often hidden from a driver’s view [18]. Taking into account the more closed nature of metro systems in comparison to mainline railways, it is safe to assume that the route knowledge of the metro drivers is at a very high level. This is also supported by a relatively small amount of category A SPaDs in T&W Metro with a considerably higher frequency of the <b>running</b> <b>signals</b> than in the mainline railways. The drivers also believe that they know the system very well. Moreover, involvement in category A SPaD incidents does not make the drivers reconsider their route knowledge (U =  21.5, p =  0.234). On the other hand, the incident data analysis suggests that the increased familiarity with the day-to-day running causes a decrease in drivers’ safety-related performance during non-routine operations. For example, engineering works and possessions affect the routine operation protocols in the system. The drivers’ assessment corroborates a reduction in confidence in such operational conditions.|$|R

40|$|With {{increasingly}} popular marathon events in urban environments, structural designers face {{a great deal}} of uncertainty when assessing dynamic performance of bridges occupied and dynamically excited by people running. While the dynamic loads induced by pedestrians walking have been intensively studied since the infamous lateral sway of the London Millennium Bridge in 2000, reliable and practical descriptions of running excitation are still very rare and limited. This interdisciplinary study has addressed the issue by bringing together a database of individual <b>running</b> force <b>signals</b> recorded by two state-of-the-art instrumented treadmills and two attempts to mathematically describe the measurements. The first modelling strategy is adopted from the available design guidelines for human walking excitation of structures, featuring perfectly periodic and deterministic characterisation of pedestrian forces presentable via Fourier series. This modelling approach proved to be inadequate for running loads due to the inherent near-periodic nature of the measured signals, a great inter-personal randomness of the dominant Fourier amplitudes and the lack of strong correlation between the amplitudes and running footfall rate. Hence, utilising the database established and motivated by the existing models of wind and earthquake loading, speech recognition techniques and a method of replicating electrocardiogram signals, this paper finally presents a numerical generator of random near-periodic <b>running</b> force <b>signals</b> which can reliably simulate the measurements. Such a model is an essential prerequisite for future quality models of dynamic loading induced by individuals, groups and crowds running under a wide range of conditions, such as perceptibly vibrating bridges and different combinations of visual, auditory and tactile cues...|$|R
