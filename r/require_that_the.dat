5|$|Loading and {{unloading}} a bulker is {{time-consuming and}} dangerous. The process is planned by the ship's chief mate under {{the direct and}} continued supervision of ship's captain. International regulations <b>require</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> captain and terminal master agree on a detailed plan before operations begin. Deck officers and stevedores oversee the operations. Occasionally loading errors are made that cause a ship to capsize or break in half at the pier.|$|E
5|$|Some {{national}} standards <b>require</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cylinder valve includes a bursting disk, a {{pressure relief device}} that will release the gas before the cylinder fails {{in the event of}} overpressurization. If a bursting disk ruptures during a dive the entire contents of the cylinder will be lost in a very short time. The risk of this happening to a correctly rated disc, in good condition, on a correctly filled cylinder is very low.|$|E

5|$|The pony is {{typically}} a 2- to 5-litre cylinder. Its capacity determines {{the depth of}} dive and decompression duration for which it provides protection. Ponies may be fixed to the diver's buoyancy compensator (BC) or main cylinder behind the diver's back, or can be clipped to the harness at the diver's side or chest or carried as a sling cylinder. Ponies provide an accepted and reliable emergency gas supply but <b>require</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> diver is trained to use them.|$|E

Luke, a Fishes member, drives them and former midwife Miriam towards the coast to a boat. They are ambushed by an armed gang, and Julian is killed. Luke kills two police officers who stop their car, and they bury Julian in the forest as Theo breaks down crying over her death. The group ditches their car for another to escape to a Fishes safe house.|$|E
5|$|One study {{looked at}} how reward {{discounting}} is context specific. By differing {{the time and}} space between small and large rewards, {{they were able to}} test how these factors affected the decision making in tamarins and marmosets. They showed that tamarins will travel longer distances for larger food rewards, but will not wait as long as marmosets. Conversely, marmosets will wait longer, but will not travel as far. They then concluded that this discounting behavior directly correlates to the normal feeding behavior of species. The tamarins feed over large distances, looking for insects. Capturing and eating insects requires a quick and impulsive decision and action. The marmosets, on the other hand, eat tree sap, which takes more time to secrete, but does not <b>require</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> marmosets to cover large distances.|$|E
5|$|The National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA, {{now known}} as the Alzheimer's Association) {{established}} the most commonly used NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria for diagnosis in 1984, extensively updated in 2007. These criteria <b>require</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> presence of cognitive impairment, and a suspected dementia syndrome, be confirmed by neuropsychological testing for a clinical diagnosis of possible or probable AD. A histopathologic confirmation including a microscopic examination of brain tissue is required for a definitive diagnosis. Good statistical reliability and validity have been shown between the diagnostic criteria and definitive histopathological confirmation. Eight cognitive domains are most commonly impaired in AD—memory, language, perceptual skills, attention, constructive abilities, orientation, problem solving and functional abilities. These domains are equivalent to the NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria as listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) published by the American Psychiatric Association.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} granted a {{production}} budget of $60 million, with $30 million funded by New Regency. Brett Ratner's RatPac-Dune Entertainment, {{a joint venture between}} Ratner's RatPac Entertainment and 20th Century Fox's former financing partner, Dune Entertainment, also funded the film. Worldview Entertainment, who also co-financed Birdman, was originally set to fund the film but backed out in July 2014 due to the departure of its CEO, Christopher Woodrow. New Regency approached 20th Century Fox for additional funding, but the company declined, citing the pay-or-play contracts made for both DiCaprio and Tom Hardy, which would <b>require</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> actors be paid regardless of whether the film is completed. Annapurna Pictures' Megan Ellison entered negotiations to finance the film shortly after. The Chinese company Guangdong Alpha Animation and Culture Company partially financed the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{investigation was}} carried out by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB, precursor to the NTSB). It emerged that pilot Roger Peterson had over four years of flying experience, of which one with Dwyer Flying Service, and had accumulated 711 flying hours, of which 128 on Bonanzas. He had also logged 52 hours of instrument flying training, although had passed only his written examination, and was not yet qualified to operate in weather that required flying solely by reference to instruments. He and Dwyer Flying Service itself were certified to operate only under visual flight rules, which essentially <b>require</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pilot must be able to see where he is going. However, {{on the night of the}} accident, visual flight would have been virtually impossible due to the low clouds, the lack of a visible horizon, and the absence of ground lights over the sparsely populated area.|$|E
5|$|The {{preliminary}} hearing began on March 13, 1951, and lasted three days, {{during which the}} Crown called 20witnesses. Diefenbaker alleged that {{the rules of the}} CNR did not <b>require</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> telegraph operator listen to the repeat of his message, but merely recommended that he should. Nevertheless, Diefenbaker's motion to dismiss was unsuccessful and Atherton was committed for trial before the Supreme Court of British Columbia (a trial-level court). Manslaughter was a charge for which the accused did not have the option of a speedy trial before a county court judge, and Atherton's case was set for the Spring Assizes in Prince George.|$|E

5|$|The {{purchase}} {{must be made}} at a treaty, as {{in other}} cases. This insures publicity, and affords a protection against fraud. But the proviso does not <b>require</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> treaty should be one between the United States and the tribe from whom the purchase is made, as in the cases coming under the first clause of the section.

5|$|The {{rules of}} {{baseball}} <b>require</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> official scorer view the game {{only from the}} press box, for two basic reasons. First, this ensures that every scorer has nearly the same perspective of the game. One of the intentions of this rule is to improve consistency in scorekeeping decisions between different official scorers working on different games at the same stadium, and between scorers in different stadiums. Second, the press box is the most neutral position within the stadium. Seated in the press box, the official scorer is surrounded by writers and broadcasters who are ostensibly neutral, and the scorer {{is less likely to}} be unduly influenced by the players, the coaches, and the crowd.|$|E
5|$|Welders often {{develop a}} {{technique}} of rapidly alternating between moving the torch forward (to advance the weld pool) and adding filler metal. The filler rod is {{withdrawn from the}} weld pool each time the electrode advances, but it is always kept inside the gas shield to prevent oxidation of its surface and contamination of the weld. Filler rods composed of metals with a low melting temperature, such as aluminum, <b>require</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> operator maintain {{some distance from the}} arc while staying inside the gas shield. If held too close to the arc, the filler rod can melt before it makes contact with the weld puddle. As the weld nears completion, the arc current is often gradually reduced to allow the weld crater to solidify and prevent the formation of crater cracks {{at the end of the}} weld.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the line's planning, Downtown Flushing was a quiet Dutch-colonial-style village; what is now Roosevelt Avenue in the area was known as Amity Street, a major {{commercial}} thoroughfare in the neighborhood. In late 1912, Flushing community groups were petitioning the Public Service Commission (PSC) to depress the proposed line in Flushing into a subway tunnel, rather than an elevated line. Unlike a subway, an el would cause disturbances to the quality of life and a loss in nearby property values, as well as a widening of Amity Street that would cause more changes to the already existing town. One Amity Street property owner compared the planned effect of an elevated Flushing Line on Amity Street to the degradation of Myrtle Avenue in Brooklyn after the Myrtle Avenue Elevated was built there. On the other hand, a subway would only <b>require</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> street be widened, even though it was more expensive than an elevated of the same length.|$|E
5|$|The legal {{elements}} and {{features of the}} major federal public corruption offenses differ. The various jurisdictional elements of the offenses <b>require</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> prosecution prove, alternatively: that the payee was a federal official; that the payee organization received $10,000 in federal funds; that the corrupt communications involved {{the use of the}} mail or interstate wires; that the corruption affected interstate commerce or interstate travel. The mens rea elements differ in whether they require a quid pro quo; a mere nexus is an easier element to prove; more difficult elements to prove include the intent to be influenced and inducement. The offenses also differ in whether the act to be procured from the public official must be an official, a violation of an official duty, a fraud on the United States, or an official transaction. The offenses also differ in whether the payor may be prosecuted in addition to the public official. Finally, the offenses differ in whether they are predicates for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and money laundering prosecutions, and in the maximum authorized prison sentence that may be imposed upon conviction.|$|E
5|$|The player {{takes on}} the role of various {{characters}} during a single-player campaign. The characters' involvement in the plot occurs simultaneously and overlaps the events in the game. As such, the player's perspective changes from one character to another between missions. Each mission features a series of objectives; the player is led to each objective with the heads up display, which marks its direction and distance. Some objectives <b>require</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> player arrives at a checkpoint, while other objectives require the player to eliminate enemies in a specified location, stand their ground to defend an objective, or plant explosive charges on an enemy installation. After the credits, a special epilogue mission is unlocked for play, featuring a four-man squad retrieving a VIP from terrorists who have hijacked an airliner. The SAS rescue the VIP and escape before the plane is destroyed. The main campaign features 30 collectible pieces of intel that award the player with game cheats and visual filters such as infinite ammunition, cluster grenades, and increased contrast.|$|E
