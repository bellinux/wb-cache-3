40|$|Unlike English law, Singapore {{has always}} been {{receptive}} to the <b>remedial</b> constructive <b>trust.</b> The {{first part of the}} article unpacks the concept of ‘remedialism’ within constructive trusts under Singapore law. It argues that the institutional and remedial dichotomy is only one way to understand ‘remedialism’ within constructive trusts; some institutional constructive trusts in fact display strong ‘remedial’ attributes. The second and third parts of the article, which form its principal focus, examine Singapore’s model of <b>remedial</b> constructive <b>trust</b> (as opposed to an institutional constructive trust) as established in three recent decisions. The discussion highlights that the Singapore <b>remedial</b> constructive <b>trust</b> is uncertain in both scope and operation...|$|R
40|$|This {{article will}} {{primarily}} consider {{the important role}} that third parties play in the award of the Australian <b>remedial</b> constructive <b>trust.</b> In his groundbreaking article "Remedies as a Legal Subject" Waddams argued that by looking at all remedies together {{it may be possible}} to examine individual remedies and to evaluate any differences. This is even more accurate with a developing remedy such as the <b>remedial</b> constructive <b>trust.</b> This article will attempt to do this with this remedy. David Wrigh...|$|R
50|$|A <b>remedial</b> {{constructive}} <b>trust</b> {{is a type}} of {{constructive trust}} recognised in New Zealand, Canada and the United States, which allows courts to give a discretionary property remedy for breaches of certain obligations, or to acknowledge various rights. It has not been recognised in English trusts law, although a number of judges have proposed that it be acknowledged.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the theoretical justifications in awarding restitutionary damages for civil wrongs and argues that restitutionary damages should be available as of right so long as appropriate rules of causation and remoteness to {{the different kinds of}} wrongs; are developed as well. In addition the scope of proprietary remedies should be rationalized and should only be explicable on institutional constructive trust principles. Only exceptionally should the <b>remedial</b> constructive <b>trust</b> be invoked...|$|R
40|$|<b>Remedial</b> {{constructive}} <b>trusts</b> {{are held}} {{out as a}} way for the courts to make better decisions: freed from the strictures of rules, courts would be better positioned to do justice on the facts, tailoring a remedy to the circumstances of the case. If this were true, their rejection in English law would be a serious failing. But {{a closer look at the}} relationship between rules and discretion suggests that it’s not true and that, when discretion is in genuine opposition to rule-determined decision-making, the outcome is not more justice but less. Moreover, when we look to the arguments of those calling for <b>remedial</b> constructive <b>trusts</b> to be introduced into English law and to those jurisdictions which claim to recognize them, this much seems to be agreed. Such differences as there are go instead to the substantive rules which govern the operation of constructive trusts. So the question English law faces is not whether we should recognise some ‘new model’ of constructive trust, but rather the more familiar inquiry into what rules are best. In addressing this question, the idea of the ‘remedial’ constructive trust is only an unnecessary distraction...|$|R
5000|$|Lac Minerals further {{confirms}} the divergence of Canadian common-law jurisprudence on constructive trusts {{to that of}} English law, which began to arise in Pettkus v. Becker. While English law {{is based on the}} concept of institutional constructive trusts (as it was later described by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council), Canadian courts have broadened it to include <b>remedial</b> constructive <b>trusts.</b> Australian and New Zealand jurisprudence can be characterized as falling in between the other two.|$|R
40|$|In England the {{constructive}} trust is characterised as institutional, arising by {{operation of law}} at the time of a recognised triggering event. In Canada and Australia the <b>remedial</b> constructive <b>trust</b> is recognised through the exercise of judicial discretion to secure equity and justice. In fact, the categories of {{constructive trust}} are not as distinct as orthodoxy dictates. Motivated by the aim of seeking harmonisation where possible, this paper proposes a new model of constructive trust, the modified constructive trust, which embodies the institutional core but modified by reference to recognised principles.

40|$|This article {{challenges}} the traditional assumption that all cases of unauthorised fiduciary gain warrant the same legal treatment, {{in particular the}} imposition of a constructive trust as a disgorgement remedy. It proposes a method of categorising the cases and ranking them based on the strength of the principal’s interest. It is suggested that in cases where the principal’s interest is not particularly strong, there is room for taking into account the interests of innocent third parties and affording them the necessary protection. For this purpose, the <b>remedial</b> constructive <b>trust</b> supplies the needed flexibility...|$|R

50|$|The Federal Superfund program, {{authorized}} by CERCLA, {{was established to}} identify, prioritize, and clean up hazardous wastes sites posing threats to {{human health and the}} environment. Sites identified under the Superfund program are placed on the National Priority List (NPL). In 2013, there were 14 NPL sites in Arkansas (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2013). ADEQ HWD ensures that State requirements are met during investigation and cleanup of sites designated under this Federal Superfund program. ADEQ’s HWD administers a similar cleanup program for abandoned hazardous wastes sites under authority of the <b>Remedial</b> Action <b>Trust</b> Fund Act (RATFA) of 1985. The Arkansas RATFA State Priority List identifies those hazardous substance sites for which expenditures to investigate and remediate are authorized.|$|R
40|$|Is the {{constructive}} trust really a trust? To answer this simple question, {{it is essential}} to understand the current meaning of the constructive term. There are many different meanings applicable to this term. Different jurisdictions (and different cases within the same jurisdiction) emphasize different aspects of the term. Outside of the USA, where a purely remedial approach is taken to the {{constructive trust}} and so it is not envisaged as a trust, then the question remains; is it a trust? In a very recent article Swadling has answered this question in the negative. However, his very important and well considered argument is not totally convincing. On balance, the constructive trust, even the Australian <b>remedial</b> constructive <b>trust,</b> remains a trust. David Wrigh...|$|R
50|$|Lord Scott held to {{the view}} that {{proprietary}} estoppel can only be used where the assurer believes they have or will have very soon acquired a right in someone’s land. He said though he would not disagree about proprietary estoppel, he would ‘find it easier and more comfortable to regard David’s equity as established via a remedial constructive trust.’ The elements of a claim are clear assurance, reasonable reliance, substantial detriment. Proprietary estoppel brings uncertain results, e.g. if Peter intended to give up the farm, but before then had wanted to use the farm as a home given his old age. Cases like Ramsden and Crabb can easily be understood as proprietary estoppel, but he finds inheritance cases easier to understand as being remedied through a <b>remedial</b> constructive <b>trust,</b> created by the parties’ common intention, since Gissing.

40|$|Security {{modifications}} to legacy network protocols are expensive and disruptive. This paper outlines an approach, based on external security monitors, for securing legacy protocols by deploying additional hosts that locally monitor the {{inputs and outputs}} of each host executing the protocol, check {{the behavior of the}} host against a safety specification, and communicate using an overlay to alert other hosts about invalid behavior and to initiate <b>remedial</b> actions. <b>Trusted</b> computing hardware provides the basis for trust in external security monitors. This paper applies this approach to secure the Border Gateway Protocol, yielding an external security monitor called N-BGP. N-BGP can accurately monitor a BGP router using commodity trusted computing hardware. Deploying N-BGP at a random 10 % of BGP routers is sufficient to guarantee the security of 80 % of Internet routes where both endpoints are monitored by N-BGP. Overall, external security monitors secure the routing infrastructure using trusted computing hardware and construct a security plane for BGP without having to modify the large base of installed routers and servers. ...|$|R
2500|$|Constructive trust: Unlike {{an express}} trust, a {{constructive}} trust is not created by {{an agreement between}} a settlor and the trustee. A constructive trust is imposed by the law as an [...] "equitable remedy". This generally occurs due to some wrongdoing, where the wrongdoer has acquired legal title to some property and cannot in good conscience be allowed to benefit from it. A constructive trust is, essentially, a legal fiction. For example, a court of equity recognizing a plaintiff's request for the equitable remedy of a constructive trust may decide that a constructive trust has been created and simply order the person holding the assets to deliver them {{to the person who}} rightfully should have them. The constructive trustee is not necessarily the person who is guilty of the wrongdoing, and in practice it is often a bank or similar organization. The distinction may be finer than the preceding exposition in that there are also said to be two forms of constructive trust, the institutional constructive <b>trust</b> and the <b>remedial</b> constructive <b>trust.</b> The latter is an [...] "equitable remedy" [...] imposed by law being truly remedial; the former arising due to some defect in the transfer of property.|$|R
40|$|From the 1970 s onward {{there have}} been {{numerous}} attempts to persuade the courts of New Zealand that unjust enrichment might be an acceptable basis for imposing equitable remedies. The foundation for this proposition rests upon the supposed existence of a broad principle that the imposition of a constructive trust is justified in any circumstances where it would be against equity or good conscience to allow the retention of property by one who has an ostensible legal title.   So the unjust enrichment, once established, becomes the cause of action and the constructive trust follows as an equitable remedy of a proprietary nature which is available to prevent the unjust enrichment.   This has important ramifications {{for the development of the}} law pertaining to restitution in this country. This paper will show that the acceptance of the <b>remedial</b> constructive <b>trust</b> is linked to the development of a law of restitution founded upon the principle of unjust enrichment.   It will also be shown that, while the roots of the conceptual distinction between law and equity remain intact, in many courts the practical ramifications of that distinction are being eroded, particularly in commercial cases. </p...|$|R

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1995 Pamela Anne O'Connor. The Social Security Act 1991 incorporates the general legal meaning of property in its definition of an asset, {{for the purpose of}} the pension means test. This creates the opportunity for pension applicants to argue that assessable assets held by them should be reduced by the amount of any equitable proprietry rights held by others in the assets. The Federal Court has held in Kintominas v Secretary, DSS and in Kidner v Secretary, DSS that equitable proprietry claims under remedial doctrines, such as under the constructive trust doctrine discussed in Baumgartner v Baumgartner are to be regarded as property even though there has been no judicial declaration of their existence, no dispute between the legal owner and the person claiming an equitabe interest, an no unconscionable abuse of title rights by the legal owner. This thesis argues that the Federal Court’s approach is not the preferable one, for three main reasons. The first relates to the changing nature of the constructive trust to a necessary element. The second is that, {{at a time when the}} constructive trust in Australia is in transition from the traditional institutional conception to a remedial paradigm along North American lines, the beneficial interest should no longer be viewed as existing independently of a judicial decree. The third argument is that, even if an equitable interest under a <b>remedial</b> constructive <b>trust</b> is accepted as existing independently of a curial declaration, it cannot be valued for the purposes of the assets test.

Given the recent attention focused on indexing, this report examines (1) the current use of indexing in the Social Security program and how reform proposals might modify that use, (2) the experiences of other developed nations that have modified indexing, (3) the effects of modifying the indexing on the distribution of benefits, and (4) the key considerations associated with modifying the indexing. To illustrate the effects of different forms of indexing on the distribution of benefits, we calculated benefit levels for a sample of workers born in 1985, using a microsimulation model. We have prepared this report under the Comptroller General's statutory authority to conduct evaluations on his own initiative as part of a continued effort to assist Congress in addressing the challenges facing Social Security.
