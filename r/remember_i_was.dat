Reflecting on the final, Mourinho was happy to admit he played part of a historic moment in football. He said, [...] "As a football game, Celtic-Porto in Seville was the most exciting football game I have ever been involved in. An unbelievable game.

500|$|By {{the summer}} of 2003, Lovering was feeling depressed. In a 2004 interview, he commented: [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{on the way to}} the bank, and I was just bummed out—everything, financially, was really a mess for me. I was {{involved}} in this relationship that was absolutely terrible. I was bottoming out. And I'm {{on the way to the}} bank and my cellphone rings. It's Joe he says, 'Guess what?'" [...] Santiago had just received a call from Thompson stating his desire to reunite the Pixies. Lovering was overjoyed at the news. He added that [...] "the saddest thing is that when I sat down to rehearse for the Pixies, I couldn't believe that I had given up something that I loved". In 2004 Lovering and the band recorded their reunion single, [...] "Bam Thwok".|$|E
500|$|Killen {{conceived}} {{of the idea}} for the Brittens after creating and developing Lone Star for the Fox network. NBC had encouraged Killen to conceive a concept for a future television series after Lone Star cancellation. Within a few weeks, Killen sent a rough draft of the script to his agent Marc Korman. [...] "It was 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, and I <b>remember</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so freaked out by the script that I went upstairs to our guest bedroom where my wife was sick with the flu and I got into bed with her," [...] recalled Korman. [...] "I called Jen and said: 'I'm telling you, this script is remarkable. I've never read a pilot like this, and for a guy who has never written a procedural show in his life, he's actually making two cases work". Initially, Salke and Korman looked to sell acquisition rights to Fox.|$|E

2500|$|Poirier faced Conor McGregor on September 27, 2014 at UFC 178. He {{lost the}} fight by TKO {{in the first}} round. This {{resulted}} in him being stopped by strikes {{for the first time}} in his career. On his match with Conor McGregor he said “I always saw it as a plus but the Conor McGregor fight was the turning point. I <b>remember</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> backstage getting ready to walk out and I saw him and he threw this smile and pointed at me. I don’t know why but it really got to me, man. It really messed with my head." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} {{was not without}} its lucky accidents: The company had just finished shooting the final segment of the sequence where Phyllis and Walter make their getaway after dumping their victim's body on the tracks. The crew was breaking for lunch before striking the set. In the script, the pair get in their car and simply drive away. But as Wilder got into his own car to leave, it wouldn't start. Inspired, he ran back and ordered the crew back. Wilder reshot the scene, only this time as Phyllis starts the car, the motor stalls and won't turn over. She tries several more times, but the car won't start and the two {{look at each other}} in growing panic. Walter desperately reaches over, turns the key and guns the motor, finally starting the car. Only then do they speed away from the crime scene. The result {{was one of the most}} suspenseful scenes in the film, but was not in the original script. MacMurray was surprised when he first saw it onscreen: [...] "...When I... turned the key I <b>remember</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing it fast and Billy kept saying, 'Make it longer, make it longer,' and finally I yelled, 'For Chrissake Billy, it's not going to hold that long,' and he said, 'Make it longer,' and he was right." ...|$|E
