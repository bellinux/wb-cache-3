40|$|Rail {{grinding}} is a {{key maintenance}} activity for Network Rail. It is performed at night through possession of the track, so process speed is critical. Increasing the metal removal rate (MRR) <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> grinding operations would {{be a way to}} improve the time taken for this operation. The aerospace industry has recently seen advances in grinding technologies that have increased MRR. This work was aimed at assessing their best practice and its application to rail grinding operations. Current Network Rail grinding operations include preventative and corrective <b>re-profiling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> head. The majority of work performed in the UK is preventative re-profiling with current train speeds ranging from 1 to 10 mile/h. Opportunities exist to increase train speed and improve the productivity of this operation through the use of more advanced grinding technologies. The most relevant aerospace technology is high efficiency deep grinding (HEDG). This approach uses: a high surface speed of the grinding wheel, superabrasive tooling, and high workpiece feed rates to remove material quickly from the cut-zone. Productivity improvements were identified by applying theory on power requirements (by assessing the specific grinding energy) and chip thickness of the grinding process. Computer CAD/CAM modelling was also performed to assess the effect of changing grinding techniques on potential gouging of the track infrastructure and/or interference with example trackside obstructions. The work concluded that opportunities do exist to improve the current productivity of grinding operations. Utilizing HEDG technology theoretically provides a 100 % train speed increase (utilizing the same power available with the current setup) for preventative re-profiling. This requires the application of high surface speeds of the grinding wheel and superabrasive technology. Further increases in train speed require increased spindle power. The chip thickness experienced by grinding grains is reduced for a peripheral grinding setup and high wheel surface speeds that is beneficial for wheel wear. The application of HEDG technology cutting {{on the periphery of the}} wheel provided optimum conditions during CAD/CAM simulation to avoid rail gouging, and any potential collision of the grinding stone with modelled trackside obstructions...|$|R

One negative flight performance attribute was its stall characteristics, which was described as initially occurring [...] "at almost the worst possible place - the inboard end of the ailerons". The stalling regime was explored heavily during the flight test programme, which led to a <b>re-profiling</b> <b>of</b> the wing's leading edge for additional outboard camber being adopted on production aircraft to improve this performance, giving greater warning and a tendency for relatively straight flight during typical stall conditions.|$|R

40|$|Rail track {{undergoes}} complex loading patterns under {{moving traffic}} conditions compared to roads {{due to its}} continued and discontinued multi-layered structure, including rail, sleepers, ballast layer, sub-ballast layer, and subgrade. Particle size distributions (PSDs) of ballast, subballast, and subgrade layers can be critical in cyclic plastic deformation <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> track under moving traffic on frequent track degradation <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> tracks, especially at bridge transition zones. Conventional test approaches: static shear and cyclic single-point load tests are however unable to replicate actual loading patterns of moving train. Multi-ring shear apparatus; {{a new type of}} torsional simple shear apparatus, which can reproduce moving traffic conditions, was used in this study to investigate influence of particle size distribution <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> track layers on cyclic plastic deformation. Three particle size distributions, using glass beads were examined under different loading patterns: cyclic sin-gle-point load, and cyclic moving wheel load to evaluate cyclic plastic deformation <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> track under different loading methods. The results of these tests suggest that particle size distributions <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> track structural layers have significant impacts on cyclic plastic deformation under moving train load.

40|$|Purpose. Calculation of {{a railway}} track on the {{strength}} {{is one of the}} sections of the overall complex research problems of interaction track and rolling stock. This paper describes the experimental study of horizontal transverse stiffness <b>of</b> railway <b>rails</b> with various strands <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> fasteners. Materials <b>of</b> this article should be relevant and will make it possible to calculate the strength of railway track using the correct and corrected performance of horizontal transverse stiffness <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> threads. Methodology. Determination of horizontal transverse rigidity <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> yarns with different designs <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> fasteners was conducted by measuring the quantities of transverse displacement <b>of</b> <b>rails</b> calculation points – namely the head and sole. For research the specialist equipment was created, made up of lineside jack DC- 20, equipped with a hydraulic pressure gauge to measure pressure and rigid rod for horizontal rail stop in the thread, the opposite of the jack. Lateral movement of the head and sole of the track were recorded, and measured with indicators of clock type within a few hundredths of a millimeter. The horizontal lateral load on the rail jack was created by the injection pressure in the cylinder which was fixed with manometer into the jack. Load <b>of</b> <b>rails</b> was conducted over 2 tons of degrees ranging from 0 to 8 tons. To obtain reliable measurement results of lateral movement of the head and the base rails, its movement was conducted for each type fasteners not less than in 3 sections. Measurements were carried out without the creation of vertical load. Findings. With the developed method was found transverse displacement magnitude <b>of</b> <b>rails</b> calculation points at different designs <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> fasteners. Originality. The experimental studies were first found the mentioned horizontal transverse stiffness <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> threads in the head and sole of modern designs for different rail fasteners.
