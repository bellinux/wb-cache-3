5|$|The Singapura was {{accepted}} for registration by the CFA in 1982 and granted championship status in 1988. In between this period, breeders {{found that the}} occasional litter would have a solid colored kitten, caused by the <b>recessive</b> <b>gene</b> for solid color. In a desire for the Singapura to breed true, many breeders chose to do test matings to pinpoint and remove from their breeding programs individuals with the <b>recessive</b> <b>gene.</b> It was discovered {{that two of the}} three foundation cats carried this gene.|$|E
5|$|One {{particular}} cultivar {{lacks the}} usual orange pigment due to carotene, owing its white colour to a <b>recessive</b> <b>gene</b> for tocopherol (vitamin E), but this cultivar and wild carrots {{do not provide}} nutritionally significant amounts of vitamin E.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{conditions}} such as dilated cardiomyopathy, where the heart becomes weakened and enlarged, and sick sinus syndrome, which {{is a type of}} abnormal heart beating which causes low blood pressure, have been identified in the breed. Phosphofructokinase deficiency is a condition caused by a <b>recessive</b> <b>gene</b> in the breed which prevents the metabolism of glucose into energy, causing the dog to have extremely low energy and be unable to exercise. The gene which causes this appears in around 10 percent of the population, but DNA testing can prevent two carrier dogs from breeding and thus creating puppies with this condition.|$|E
50|$|Litters of {{different}} colored cubs are not unusual because {{the white and}} golden tabby colours are caused by combinations of hidden <b>recessive</b> <b>genes</b> carried by the parents. White tigers, such as Dreamworld's Mohan (named after the white tiger captured in India in the 1950s), are highly inbred. Inbreeding reduces genetic variability and may cause hidden genes to manifest {{as there is a}} greater probability that two <b>recessive</b> <b>genes</b> will meet up.|$|R

5|$|The Galloway breed {{comes from}} the cattle native to the {{south-west}} region of Scotland, first fully developed in the 17th century. Originally there was much variation within this breed, including many different colours and patterns. The original Galloway herd book only registered black cattle, but the <b>recessive</b> <b>gene</b> for red colour persisted in the population, and eventually dun Galloways were also allowed into the herd book. As a result, although black {{is still the most}} common colour for Galloways, they can also be red and several shades of dun. In 1877 the Galloway Cattle Society was formed.|$|E
5|$|After the tournament, Yusuke returns home, but {{has little}} time to rest as he is {{challenged}} to a fight by three teenagers possessing superhuman powers and who end up taking the detective hostage. Kuwabara and the others rescue him and learn that the whole scenario was a test put on by Genkai. It is disclosed that Shinobu Sensui, Yusuke's predecessor as Underworld Detective, has recruited six other powerful beings to help him take over where Sakyo left off, opening a hole to the Demon Plane in order to cause genocide of the human race. Yusuke and his friends challenge and defeat Sensui's associates one-by-one, culminating in a final battle between the two detectives. Sensui kills Yusuke then retreats into the newly opened portal to the Demon Plane. Yusuke is reborn as a partial demon, discovering that his ancestor passed down a <b>recessive</b> <b>gene</b> that would hide until an heir with sufficient power surfaced, when his demonic lineage would be revealed. Yusuke travels to the Demon Plane and defeats Sensui {{with the aid of}} the spirit of his ancestor who takes control of Yusuke's body to finish the fight.|$|E
25|$|Juvenile Dilated Cardiomyopathy is a rare, fatal {{condition}} {{caused by}} an autosomal <b>recessive</b> <b>gene.</b> It affects young dogs, who succumb to heart failure before reaching adulthood. As a simple <b>recessive</b> <b>gene,</b> it had been difficult to identify and was particularly heartbreaking as seemingly healthy puppies would suddenly die, often shortly after joining their adopted families. Since a <b>recessive</b> <b>gene</b> is responsible, that means if {{at least one parent}} is homozygous dominant (that is, it does not carry a copy of the cardio version of the gene), its offspring cannot develop the disease.|$|E
50|$|Mitotic {{recombination}} {{is a type}} {{of genetic}} recombination that may occur in somatic cells during their preparation for mitosis in both sexual and asexual organisms. In asexual organisms, the study of mitotic recombination is one way to understand genetic linkage because it is the only source of recombination within an individual. Additionally, mitotic recombination can result in the expression of <b>recessive</b> <b>genes</b> in an otherwise heterozygous individual. This expression has important implications for the study of tumorigenesis and lethal <b>recessive</b> <b>genes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Both {{dominant}} and <b>recessive</b> <b>genes</b> exist {{which can cause}} mild to profound impairment. Rarely X-linked <b>recessive</b> <b>genes</b> for hearing loss occur and these are passed from unaffected mothers onto sons who then have hearing loss. Daughters are unaffected carriers because the second X chromosome will provide the second normal copy of the gene, whereas the shorter Y chromosome does not.Dominant and recessive hearing impairment can be syndromic or nonsyndromic. Recent gene mapping has identified dozens of nonsyndromic dominant (DFNA#) and recessive (DFNB#) forms of deafness.|$|R

40|$|In diallel crossing, {{excluding}} reciprocal ones, five divergent genotypes {{of barley}} (Vada, Đerdap, NS- 293, Jagodinac and Sladoran) were {{included with the}} mode of inheritance and gene effect studied using the regression analysis of variance and co-variance {{for the number of}} kernels per spike. The absence of inter-allele interaction established using the regression analysis VrWr and WrW resulted from the use of the mode selected. In the inheritance of the number of kernels per spike, the regression pointed at dominant gene effect {{as well as at the}} unevenly distributed dominant and <b>recessive</b> <b>genes</b> in the genotypes selected. While Jagodinac, Vada and NS- 293 had the highest number of dominant, Đerdap and Sladoran had the highest one of the <b>recessive</b> <b>genes</b> for the number of kernels per spike. Therefore, in the two-rowed genotypes, the higher number of dominant genes was, the higher number of kernels per spike was, and conversely, the higher number of the <b>recessive</b> <b>genes</b> was, the lower number of kernels per spike was...|$|R

25|$|Due to a {{deficiency}} of the enzyme diaphorase I (NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase), methemoglobin levels rise {{and the blood}} of met-Hb patients has reduced oxygen-carrying capacity. Instead of being red in color, the arterial blood of met-Hb patients is brown. This results in the skin of Caucasian patients gaining a bluish hue. Hereditary met-Hb {{is caused by a}} <b>recessive</b> <b>gene.</b> If only one parent has this gene, offspring will have normal-hued skin, but if both parents carry the gene, there is a chance the offspring will have blue-hued skin.|$|E
25|$|There are two coat {{types in}} the Akita, the {{standard}} coat length and the long coat. The long coat is considered a fault in the show ring, however. The long coat, also known as 'Moku' {{is the result of}} an autosomal <b>recessive</b> <b>gene</b> and may only occur phenotypically if both sire and dam are carriers. They have longer (about 3–4inches in length) and softer coats and are known to have sweeter temperaments. It is believed that this gene comes from the now extinct Karafuto-Ken 樺太犬. Unlike their short coat cousins, the long coats are less highly prized and thus more affordable.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that 1 in 25,000 babies born in the United States will {{have some form of}} the mucopolysaccharidoses. It is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that only individuals inheriting the defective gene from both parents are affected. (The exception is MPS II, or Hunter syndrome, in which the mother alone passes along the defective gene to a son.) When both people in a couple have the defective gene, each pregnancy carries with it a one in four chance that the child will be affected. The parents and siblings of an affected child may have no sign of the disorder. Unaffected siblings and select relatives of a child with one of the mucopolysaccharidoses may carry the <b>recessive</b> <b>gene</b> and could pass it to their own children.|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{basis of}} {{salinity}} tolerance for three parameters Ct, C 50 and C 0 in P. americanum using the diallel analysis was investigated. Tolerance for Ct, C 50, and C 0 {{was due to}} both additive and dominance genetic effects with indication of over-dominance. For these three parameters, dominance is predominantly towards salt sensitivity, {{but it appears that}} in different accessions, there are different gene effects for each character. <b>Recessive</b> <b>genes</b> are evident in the salt tolerant line ICMV- 94474 for Ct and C 50, and in the other tolerant line 10878 are also evident for C 50 and C 0 for <b>recessive</b> <b>genes.</b> Salinity data set were found to be adequate totally for C 50 and C 0, but partially adequate for Ct. It appears in pearl millet that in some accessions <b>recessive</b> <b>genes</b> are responsible for salt tolerance for Ct, C 50, and C 0, but this trend is not consistent. Different (dominant / <b>recessive)</b> <b>genes</b> control each accession for Ct, C 50, and C 0. The maximum narrow sense and broad sense of heritability were found for C 50 and this suggests that C 50 is the best character for selection, rather than absolute root length. C 50 is highly correlated with Ct, and C 50 is also signifi cantly correlated with C 0. These results suggest that the genetic bases of these genes are linked to some degree. These correlations would be of considerable value in breeding for improved salinity tolerance...|$|R

25|$|White is {{acceptable}} {{on the chest}} and toes. The presence of black guard hairs or ticking is not addressed in the AKC standard, although the elaboration of the AKC standard notes the amount of black or dark brown in the coat should not be excessive. The FCI standard states that excessive black hairs throughout the coat are highly undesirable. Ridgebacks sometimes have a dark mask. The dog's nose should be black or brown (liver) {{in keeping with the}} color of the dog. No other colored nose is permissible. The brown nose is a <b>recessive</b> <b>gene.</b> It is not as common as a black nose; some breeders believe the inclusion of brown noses in a breeding program is necessary for maintaining the vibrancy of the coat. The eyes should be round and should reflect the dog's color: dark eyes with a black nose, amber eyes with a brown (liver) nose. Ridgebacks have a strong, smooth tail, which is usually carried in a gentle curve backwards.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{strain of}} snow white tigers came from {{repeated}} brother–sister matings of Bhim and Sumita at Cincinnati Zoo. The gene involved {{may have come}} from a Siberian tiger, via their part-Siberian ancestor Tony. Continued inbreeding appears to have caused a <b>recessive</b> <b>gene</b> for stripelessness to show up. About one fourth of Bhim and Sumita's offspring were stripeless. Their striped white offspring, which have been sold to zoos around the world, may also carry the stripeless gene. Because Tony's genome is present in many white tiger pedigrees, the gene may also be present in other captive white tigers. As a result, stripeless white tigers have appeared in zoos as far afield as the Czech Republic (Liberec), Spain and Mexico. Stage magicians Siegfried & Roy were the first to attempt to selectively breed tigers for stripelessness; they owned snow-white Bengal tigers taken from Cincinnati Zoo (Tsumura, Mantra, Mirage and Akbar-Kabul) and Guadalajara, Mexico (Vishnu and Jahan), as well as a stripeless Siberian tiger called Apollo.|$|E
25|$|Hypokalaemia, {{a genetic}} disease which is {{characterized}} by low serum potassium levels, has also {{been seen in the}} British Burmese and can similarly be traced to certain bloodlines. The gene is recessive, and both parents must carry it for the kittens to develop the problem. A carrier mated to a non-carrier may pass the problem on unnoticed for several generations. Clinical signs include skeletal muscle weakness, which is often episodic in nature and either affects the whole cat or is localised to the neck muscles. As a consequence the cat can have difficulty in walking and holding their head correctly. In extreme cases, the clinical symptoms can result in death if unattended medically. Hypokalaemic cats can usually lead a normal life if they get the correct potassium supplement. Onset of symptoms often occurs around puberty and many may never experience another attack. A DNA test is now available to identify cats affected by or carrying this <b>recessive</b> <b>gene.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{devised a}} novel {{procedure}} to identify human cancer genes {{acting in a}} recessive manner. Our strategy was to combine {{the contributions of the}} different types of genetic alterations to loss of function: amino-acid substitutions, frame-shifts, gene deletions. We studied over 20, 000 genes in 3 Gigabases of coding sequences and 700 array comparative genomic hybridizations. <b>Recessive</b> <b>genes</b> were scored according to nucleotide mismatches under positive selective pressure, frame-shifts and genomic deletions in cancer. Four different tests were combined together yielding a cancer recessive p-value for each studied gene. One hundred and fifty four candidate <b>recessive</b> cancer <b>genes</b> (p-value < 1. 5 x 10 (- 7), FDR = 0. 39) were identified. Strikingly, the prototypical cancer <b>recessive</b> <b>genes</b> TP 53, PTEN and CDKN 2 A all ranked in the top 0. 5 % genes. The functions significantly affected by cancer mutations are exactly overlapping those of known cancer genes, with the critical exception for the absence of tyrosine kinases, as expected for a recessive gene-set...|$|R

500|$|Mark Lawson of The Guardian {{noted that}} the cause of Cal's {{hermaphroditic}} condition is an inherited <b>recessive</b> <b>gene.</b> According to UC Riverside psychology professor Sonja Lyubomirsky, the novel examines how an individual's traits are due neither solely to nature nor solely to nurture. Similarly, Cal's gender cannot be defined solely as male or female. Rather, it is both male and female. Addressing how genetic determinism may have renewed the antediluvian beliefs about destiny, Eugenides refutes the post-Freudian beliefs that a person's traits are mainly due to nurture. Thus, the novel pits evolutionary biology against free will. Eugenides sought to find a compromise between these two views.

50|$|Another {{consequence}} is that hymenopterans {{may be more}} resistant to the deleterious effects of inbreeding.
