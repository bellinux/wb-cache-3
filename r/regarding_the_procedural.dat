30|$|Here {{there is}} a caveat that is our concern. Although skilled writers showed much higher {{procedural}} awareness, one cannot deny the fact that strategy has a capability of becoming implicit and automatized to that extent {{that it could be}} hardly ever accessible to skillful writers’ consciousness (DeKeyser 2003; Scheffler and Cinciała 2010). Moreover, no agreements have been reached in term of the degree of consciousness involved in metacognitive knowledge and strategy (Cary and Reder 2002). Therefore, <b>regarding</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedural</b> awareness, relying on qualitative analyses rather quantitative ones would yield more reliable results. This issue also applies to conditional metacognitive awareness because some of the participants including skilled and less-skilled writers did not explicitly know why and when they do what they do while preparing an essay. However, skilled writers showed a higher awareness of the conditions in which they employ strategies and this was unveiled through giving explicit examples in their interviews.|$|E

Further to the amendments brought through the New Civil Procedural Code, the claim for annulment of the resolutions of the general assembly must be analyzed from a procedural point of view, as well as from a substantial standpoint. The shareholders must be aware of the grounds for challenging a general assembly's resolution to properly safeguard their rights.

40|$|Studies on {{the fate}} and effects of organic {{pollutants}} in soil and sediment are often carried out under laboratory conditions and often require the study compound to be introduced, or spiked, into the test substrate. The procedures adopted to spike relatively large amounts of hydrophobic organic compounds into soil and sediment can introduce interferences into experiments that {{have the potential to}} dominate the process(es) under investigation. This review identifies and discusses key factors of spiking procedures that can introduce significant interferences to experiments. These include soil or sediment drying and rewetting, effects of carrier solvents, and the homogeneity of spike distribution. The persistence of solvents, and therefore their contribution to soil and sediment organic carbon, is discussed with reference to potential effects on the partitioning behavior of spiked compounds. We have summarized the spiking procedures used in 64 published articles and have evaluated the information supplied by authors. From this analysis, we conclude that, in general, authors should report more detailed information <b>regarding</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedural</b> aspects of compound spiking. We conclude that standard operating procedures need to be validated and recommended for spiking organic compounds into soil and sediment by recommended organizations. As an aid to this process, we recommend a number of practices to observe when spiking organic compounds into soil and sediment...|$|E
40|$|Legal context The {{recognition}} {{and protection of}} well-known marks in Indonesia has improved {{over the last few}} years for a variety of reasons. Key points First, the Asian Crisis resulted in the creation of a Commercial Court, which is a clear improvement over the previously responsible District Courts. Secondly, the increasingly frequent publication of court decisions has improved transparency and consistency of those decisions. Well-known marks are now clearly protected against use for similar goods/services. Protection is extended to dissimilar goods/services by applying Article 16 (3) TRIPS directly or by arguing that registration occurred in bad faith. Nevertheless, decisions thus far concern almost exclusively revocation and invalidity of registrations. Civil remedies such as damages and interim injunctions are hardly used, because the outdated civil procedural law has not familiarised judges with such legal instruments. Clearing the register of infringing registrations is another matter of concern. Cancellation for non-use for three consecutive years can be difficult, because the plaintiff is required to provide evidence of the last use in the production of the goods/services rather than in the course of trade more generally. Practical significance While it has become much easier to protect well-known marks in Indonesia, much work remains to be done <b>regarding</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedural</b> framework of civil infringement proceedings and regarding the clearing of the register. <br /...|$|E

40|$|Existing {{research}} on {{the legitimacy of the}} UN Security Council is conceptual or theoretical, for the most part, as scholars tend to make legitimacy assessments with reference to objective standards. Whether UN member states perceive the Security Council as legitimate or illegitimate has yet to be investigated systematically; nor do we know whether states care primarily about the Council's compliance with its legal mandate, its procedures, or its effectiveness. To address this gap, our article analyzes evaluative statements made by states in UN General Assembly debates on the Security Council, for the period 1991 – 2009. In making such statements, states confer legitimacy on the Council or withhold legitimacy from it. We conclude the following: First, the Security Council suffers from a legitimacy deficit because negative evaluations of the Council by UN member states far outweigh positive ones. Nevertheless, the Council does not find itself in an intractable legitimacy crisis because it still enjoys a rudimentary degree of legitimacy. Second, the Council's legitimacy deficit results primarily from states' concerns <b>regarding</b> <b>the</b> body's <b>procedural</b> shortcomings. Misgivings as regards shortcomings in performance rank second. Whether or not the Council complies with its legal mandate has failed to attract much attention at all...|$|R

Further, the proportion of distribution to heirs and non-heirs can {{be determined by the}} donor. Most hibah cases are decided by referring to the traditional legal opinions of Muslim scholars. No doubt these has been the practice and position to follow and adhere to the earlier rulings of the traditional scholars by the Syariah courts, however with the evolution and development of new issues and cases in hibah in either the preliminary up {{to the end of the}} legal process has contributed to difficulties of the assets distribution. Among others which often arise is that no specific law or enactment of how the hibah cases should be dealt with. Further, with lack of information <b>regarding</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedural</b> law on hibah in the Syariah court has brought to the difficulties in implementing and giving accurate and just decision(s) made by the court as well as the administration and the judiciary wise. This article tries to analyze and ascertain the possible legal and procedural reforms in the application of hibah with emphasis on its application in Melaka Tengah. The study is based on the relevant statutory, statistics on the registered hibah cases in Syariah Courts in Melaka Tengah and views of some authoritative persons in the area. Based on the findings, it revealed that most reported hibah cases were very minimal in which proven that most Muslims did not realized of its existence and importance although it can be the best alternative for them to manage the distribution of their assets rather opt for wasiyyah and faraidh. This discussion is not meant to say that wasiyyah and faraidh is no longer significant in muslim assets management but its practice was a bit hastle with the interference from other institution(s) or parties i. e. confirmation or declaration from state land office, direct or indirect individuals involvement, management issues which contribute to the postponement and lateness resolution to the case(s) which may take years sometimes, as well as the jurisdiction of the courts to hear the case(s). Thus, the significant of this paper is to seek the best route i. e. to have a specific laws and procedural in hibah to address these issues or problems in Melaka Tengah and perhaps it could be extended and implemented to other states in Malaysia. By having a step to a step hibah procedure and clear law to it, somehow it may ease the difficulties and burden of both parties involved. Besides by enacting a specific hibah law, Muslims will be more aware of its existence and roles and opt to manage their assets by using hibah rather than involving themselves into unfortunate problems that may encounter in the future...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper had}} been {{presented}} for promotion at the University of Khartoum. To {{get the full}} text please contact the other at babiker 69 @hotmail. com•	This paper mainly focuses on what the author calls ‘the judiciary of conciliation’ {{and the role of}} the Judiciary in settling disputes in accordance with Sharia Law and Sudanese statutory legislations. The author further highlights similar substantive laws and practices in other jurisdictions such as Egypt, Syria and France. •	The author has argued that conciliation is defined in Article 3 of the 1984 Sudanese Civil Transactions Act and it is main purpose is 'to settle or end a dispute or claims between two parties through consensus’. The author argues that this definition is derived from Hanafi religious school of thought as one of the sources of Sudanese legislations. The author in the Article addresses the elements of ‘conciliation’ which include the following: (a) consent; (b) the existence of a dispute or an expected dispute; (c) mutual concessions to be offered by both parties; (d) the intention or willingness of both parties to settle or end the dispute. The author further highlights the importance of ‘conciliation’ in reducing the burden of litigation on the parties to the dispute in terms of cost involved, effort and time as well as removing from courts huge burden to adjudicate cases. Above all, conciliation is also perceived as realizing justice, create societal peace and security. •	The author further examined the distinction between ‘conciliation’ and ‘pardoning’. The author has also addressed the issue of ‘conciliation’ in criminal cases arguing that ‘conciliation’ as a general rule is not permitted under Sharia law with regard to ‘hudud crimes’ while it is permitted in Qisas crimes. The author has also examined the practice of other jurisdictions such as Egypt, France and Syria where statutory laws in these countries recognize ‘conciliation’ and set up first instance courts or ‘conciliation councils’ to deal with disputes. As far as Sudan is concerned, the author has referred to judicial precedents regarding conciliation. He further argues that court judgements cannot even be subjected to appeals in higher courts according to article 155 of the Civil Procedures Act which prohibits appeals in cases where the parties to the dispute have agreed or consented to the decision reached as a result of ‘conciliation’. The author also argues that 'conciliation' is regarded as the ‘master of all judgements’. However, the High Court in some cases decided that the ‘conciliation’ judgement can be appealed if there are procedural or legal mistakes directly affecting the rights of the parties. •	<b>Regarding</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedural</b> aspects of conciliation in Sudanese laws the author argues that the 1984 Civil Procedures Act does not adequately address the required procedures for reaching consensus or conciliation. However, the case shall be referred to the Judge in order to reach conciliation. The Judge in this case may himself engage in the process of conciliation or delegate his powers. Also, Article 226 (1) of the 1984 Civil Procedures Act provides that at any time and before the court makes a final decision the parties the conflict may reach ‘conciliation’ or settlement outside court and this conciliation may be done inside or outside the court. Sudan’s legal system also recognizes two types of conciliations: (1) judicial conciliation which falls under the jurisdiction of the judicial Council; and (2) non-judicial conciliation which takes place outside the Judicial Council. Article 227 provides that before a court issues a verdict and due to the nature and circumstances of the case and the relationship of the parties to the dispute the court may invite the parties and advice them to reach ‘conciliation’. In this case, the court can issue an order to stop the claim and gives a deadline for the parties to reach a final agreement. •	Regarding the verification of conciliation in front of the court Article 228 (1) provides that once the parties reach conciliation before the court it shall be included and authorized as part of the court proceedings and hence endorsed by the parties to the dispute. The court can also endorse written conciliation agreement reached by the parties outside the court. The court however, shall verify that any conciliation agreement reached by the parties does not contradict the law or ‘good conduct’. Also, agreements reached outside the court under Article 228 (3) requires from the parties to inform the court so as to be formally endorsed and to be part of the legal claims. Article 228 (4) also provides that courts can stop the legal proceedings to enable the parties to reach conciliation within a specific timeframe to decided by the court. If the parties did not reach any conciliation the court will proceed an issue a verdict...|$|E
40|$|Romantic {{relationships}} {{are assumed to}} be guided by norms and rules, however research in the field of personal relationships has not directly addressed the area of relationship rules in romantic relationships, but has investigated their violations, with a specific focus on examples such as infidelity and deception. The present research program provides the first comprehensive study of rules and expectations in romantic relationships. The overall aim of the research is to explore the types of rules and expectations, or relational standards that exist in romantic relationships, how they come to exist, and their function within relationships. Given the lack of research on relational standards, a program of four studies, utilising both qualitative and quantitative methods was proposed to address the research aims. A combination of methods was deemed appropriate as qualitative methods would allow exploration of the types of relational standards that exist in romantic relationships, while quantitative methods could be used to explore their structure, function, and potential correlates. An initial study of the use of deception was based on previous work by the author. This study aimed to combine research on the strategies of deceptive use, with the motivations that are provided for engaging in deception, in order to further understand how deception is used in romantic relationships. A survey of 152 individuals currently in romantic relationships demonstrated that individuals tend to use multiple strategies when they engage in deception, and prefer to use less overt strategies than lying. Consistent with research on victim and perpetrator accounts, individuals believed their partners would view the deception as more serious than they themselves would.;Deception can be viewed as one example of the violation of major relationship rules and expectations regarding trust and honesty, which prompted the question of what other rules and expectations exist in romantic relationships. This question provided the impetus for the subsequent studies, the aims of which were to explore what rules and expectations exist in romantic relationship, and how they come to exist. A qualitative study using focus groups and interviews with couples enabled the development of 16 categories about which rules and expectations typically exist. These categories described both the emotional aspects of a relationship, such as loyalty, fidelity, help and support, and the day-to-day functioning of a relationship, such as those regarding roles and time allocation. A third study, using quantitative methods, presented the 16 categories to 106 individuals in order to validate the categories, investigate how they come to exist (whether they are discussed or exist as expectations) and explore their function in terms of their importance to the relationship and levels of threat and (un) forgivability when they are violated. It also sought to explore whether relational standards were related to a measure of adjustment, specifically one. s self-restraint. All 16 categories were endorsed, and were generally seen as being common in most relationships, and important to a relationship. s functioning. The categories differed in their importance, threat and unforgivability, with rules and expectations about the emotional aspects of a relationship consistently rated as more important than rules and expectations about the procedural aspects of a relationship. The number of rules endorsed, and the types of rules discussed and expected, were not related to an individual. s adjustment. A final study of 45 couples aimed to replicate the results from the third study, as well as explore whether there was agreement in partners. responses.;The final study also investigated whether relational standards were related to individual factors such as adjustment, personality, and the tendency to betray, and relationship variables such as trust, satisfaction and commitment. The results confirmed the pattern of endorsement found in the third study, that rules and expectations regarding the emotional aspects of relationship are regarded as the most important, and the most threatening and unforgivable when violated. Rules and expectations <b>regarding</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedural</b> aspects or the day-to-day functioning of the relationship are seen as least important to therelationship, and least threatening and easily forgiven when violated. The present research program demonstrated that there are identifiable areas about which couples have rules and expectations, and that these form a hierarchy based on their importance to the relationship. No differences were found in the way that relational standards come to exist, and relational standards were not found to be related to either individual or relationship factors. The identification of rule and expectation categories may help couples clarify their expectations of each other, and reduce potential areas of conflict. They also provide a starting point from which to further explore the importance of relational standards to relationship functioning...|$|E

40|$|The article focuses, comparatively, on {{remarkable}} {{recent developments}} in Latin America <b>regarding</b> <b>the</b> programmatic adjudication, <b>procedural</b> enforcement, and internationalization of fundamental entitlements. It applauds, first, {{the manner in which}} many Latin American courts have uncompromisingly enforced positive guaranties in the last decade or so. Secondly, it analyzes various widely available procedures for the vindication of rights, including the writ of protection or security, unconstitutionality actions, and collective suits. Thirdly, it studies {{the manner in which the}} interaction between domestic and transnational rights has become extremely intense in the region. Finally, it notes the tension between the realization of the juridical precept and the sporadic precariousness of the rule of law and contends that, beyond adopting new measures or punishing violators more severely, Latin American countries must generally enhance the legitimacy of legal norms by renewing their commitment to democracy, as well as to other ideals, such as the rule of law itself, personal freedom, and (above all) solidarity...|$|R

40|$|As {{our world}} {{effectively}} shrinks, many countries {{are beginning to}} reach a striking substantive consensus <b>regarding</b> <b>the</b> prohibition of employment discrimination. Yet, and in sharp contrast, nothing approaching consensus has yet emerged <b>regarding</b> <b>the</b> best <b>procedural</b> method with which to resolve individual claims of employment discrimination. Instead, while countries have struggled, individually, to devise processes that meet a variety of needs, none seems {{to be satisfied with}} its efforts. Litigation is slow, costly, and impersonal. Informal processes such as conciliation, mediation, arbitration, or administrative processes aim to be faster and cheaper, but may not result in adequate enforcement of discrimination laws. This Article suggests that by comparing <b>the</b> <b>procedural</b> approaches taken by three countries we can learn a great deal about why it has been so difficult to devise a good procedure for resolving employment discrimination disputes and also gain some significant insights regarding how to better handle such disputes in the future. Specifically, it provides an in-depth examination of how the United States, Britain, and Australia have attempted to handle employment discrimination disputes. This original comparative research reveals that policy makers in each country have typically focused only or primarily on what has and has not worked in their own jurisdiction, and have often devised systems that oscillate, somewhat predictably, between formal systems such as litigation and informal systems such as conciliation. Through examining ten aspects of employment discrimination claims that are common to all three jurisdictions, the Article then offers several key prescriptive insights. First, because {{it is highly unlikely that}} any single dispute resolution process will be able to serve all of our public and private interests in resolving employment discrimination claims, it is instead desirable that a jurisdiction offer multiple processes. Second, in designing each of these processes policy makers should focus explicitly on the public and private interests that have been identified, and try to design each process to serve certain of the interests. Whereas public interests are often best served by litigation, private interests are instead often best served by mediation or conciliation. Third, policy makers need to focus on how the selection is made among processes, and by whom, to protect as many of the identified interests as is possible. Finally, this Article contends that while these insights have been drawn from the context of employment discrimination, they will also have applicability to disputes arising in other substantive contexts...|$|R
