40|$|As {{the market}} for high speed Internet and {{cellular}} communication services reaches maturity, communication services have shown a limit to growth {{based on the number}} of subscribers. Next Generation Networks services based on IP <b>Routing</b> <b>form</b> the beginning of a new age of innovative and affordable services where consumers will witness substantial new service offerings and also savings in their consumption bills for such services. The requirement of these applications challenges the limitations of the network technologies that are in place today. Next Generation Networks are based on internet technologies including Internet Protocol (IP) and Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS). The thesis therefore presents an overview of the converged IP Network services, focusing on opportunities for service differentiation and introducing current service oriented technology to meet up the demands of consumers. These technologies allow service providers to build and operate networks that can be able to provide local, long distance, global, mobile, data, voice and internet services to consumers. In meeting the demands of these newer services to its customers adequately with high Quality of Service (QoS), Speed, Traffic Engineering and Scalability, Internet Service Providers have engaged Next Generation Networks using the more reliable Multi-Protocol Label Switching in the core of their networks while also delivering such services through a secure means over the public internet by using Virtual Private Networks. osagiesolo@yahoo. co. uk, sirozed@yahoo. co...|$|E

It is argued that the effective design of an e-voting system and its viability can be enhanced by a two-pronged approach to robustness. First, it requires a clear distinction between two forms of robustness: robustness at protocol level and robustness at system level. Second, selected technologies should be integrated into an appropriate architecture in order to address robustness simultaneously at the two levels. The proposed approach is illustrated by the design and implementation of an e-voting system based on the FOO 92 protocol. A service-oriented architecture supported by onion <b>routing</b> <b>forms</b> the basis of the system.

This inclination leads systems to some local and global minimum tension states called "jammed states" and "balanced states", respectively. We show that not only paths towards jammed states are not completely random but also there exist secret pseudo deterministic paths that bound the system to end up in these special states. Our results display that the Inverse Participation Ratio method (IPR) can be a suitable indicator that exhibits collective behaviors of systems. According to this method, these specific paths are those that host the most participation of the constituents in the system. A direct proportionality exists between the distance and the selectable paths towards local minimums; where by getting close to the final steps there is no other way but the one to the jammed states.

40|$|Abstract — Our propose works a {{load-aware}} routing {{scheme for}} wireless networks (WNs). In a WMN, the traffic load {{tends to be}} unevenly distributed over the network. In this situation, the load-aware routing scheme can balance the load, and consequently, enhance the overall network capacity. We design a routing scheme which maximizes the utility, i. e., the router is a primary component in the infrastructure of today’s internet and are consequently are active target for the attackers. The Load balancing is difficult due to dropping, diverting, delaying or manipulating the packets and thereby mount denial of service, surveillance or {{man in the middle}} attach. In this paper. We detect the existence of compromised routers and isolate them from the routing fabric by the degree of user satisfaction, using mobile agents call the Ant-Nets. It is a distributed mobile agent that was inspired by the works on the ant colony metaphor for solving optimization problems. In this paper, when the packets moved from one AP to another AP using default path, if any problem occur in any AP, the AntNet is solved that existence problems to transmit the another shortest path. From that we can conclude avoid the packet loss and reduce the reception time to achieve the load optimization global load balancing.

40|$|Wireless Sensor Network is made-up {{of large}} number of sensor node and one or more sink node. Sensor nodes are small in size and low in cost. Sensor network are {{equipped}} with sensor devices and powered by small size batteries. Since each sensor node has low energy, these nodes are usually put to sleep mode to conserve energy, and this helps to increase the network lifetime. Sleep scheduling algorithm should take care that data continuously <b>routed</b> <b>form</b> sensor node to sink node. In this paper we are going discuss sleep scheduling for sensor network using energy conservation protocol and tree integrated with proposed sleep scheduling algorithm. The root node in tree is sink node and other sensor nodes are branch nodes and leaf nodes. The leaf nodes are always put to sleep mode and branch nodes are remain awake. This ensures that path must exist from any sensor node to sink node. The tree is periodically reconstructed considering the remaining energy of each node by checking balance energy consumption of nodes, and removes the failed nodes from the tree. This proposed approach greatly minimize average energy consumption rate of all sensor node as we are putting more number of nodes in sleep mode. In this paper, we are proposing a novel Efficient Energy-Aware Routing Protocol (EEAR) to increase lifetime of sensor network by minimizing energy consumption and balancing load between all the sensor nodes.

40|$|The Internet’s routing {{system is}} facing {{stresses}} {{due to its}} poor fundamental scaling properties. Compact routing is a research field that studies fundamental limits of routing scalability and designs algorithms that try to meet these limits. In particular, compact routing research shows that shortest-path <b>routing,</b> <b>forming</b> a core of traditional routing algorithms, cannot guarantee routing table (RT) sizes that on all network topologies grow slower than linearly as functions of the network size. However, {{there are plenty of}} compact routing schemes that relax the shortest-path requirement and allow for improved, sublinear RT size scaling that is mathematically provable for all static network topologies. In particular, there exist compact routing schemes designed for grids, trees, and Internet-like topologies that offer RT sizes that scale logarithmically with the network size. In this paper, we demonstrate that in view of recent results in compact routing research, such logarithmic scaling on Internet-like topologies is fundamentally impossible in the presence of topology dynamics or topology-independent (flat) addressing. We use analytic arguments to show that the number of routing control messages per topology change cannot scale better than linearly on Internet-like topologies. We also employ simulations to confirm that logarithmic RT size scaling gets broken by topology-independent addressing, a cornerstone of popular locator-identifier split proposals aiming at improving routing scaling in the presence of network topology dynamics or host mobility. These pessimistic findings lead us to the conclusion that a fundamental re-examination of assumptions behind routing models and abstractions is needed in order to find a routing architecture that would be able to scale “indefinitely. ...|$|R

Sine COPE can only discover coding opportunities in established routes, which neglects many potential coding opportunities, the network throughput of COPE is the lowest in the four routings. Furthermore, compared to DCAR and FORM, NAER has a better throughput because it improves the network coding condition of DCAR and FORM, and proposes UCC which increase the quantity of coding opportunities and guarantee the decodable of coded packets.|$|R
