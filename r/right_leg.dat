5|$|Ellie Victoria Cole {{was born}} in the Melbourne suburb of Lilydale on 12 December 1991. Her mother and {{grandfather}} were both swimmers, and her father was athletic. At two years of age, she was diagnosed with a rare tumour, a sarcoma that was wrapped around the nerves of her <b>right</b> <b>leg.</b> After unsuccessful attempts to treat her cancer with chemotherapy, her <b>right</b> <b>leg</b> was amputated above the knee on 14 February 1994. Eight weeks after the surgery, as part of her rehabilitation, Cole's mother Jenny enrolled her in swimming lessons. Cole's instructors expected her to take up to a year to learn how to swim in a straight line, but it took her two weeks.|$|E

5|$|Ali is Baba's servant, a Hazara {{believed}} to be Hassan's father. In his youth, Baba's father adopted him after his parents were killed by a drunk driver.

His <b>right</b> <b>leg</b> was amputated in 1977 after {{he was diagnosed with}} osteosarcoma, though he continued to run using an artificial leg.

5|$|He is ambidextrous, and {{had trouble}} {{differentiating}} {{between right and}} left, which affected his football games as a boy. He uses his right hand to draw and color and his left hand to write. He typically kicks with his <b>right</b> <b>leg</b> in Sweet Chin Music, but uses either arm for his signature elbow drop, depending on position.|$|E
5|$|Alcoholism {{and poor}} health afflicted Clark during his final years. In 1809 he {{suffered}} a severe stroke. When he fell into an operating fireplace, Clark suffered a burn on his <b>right</b> <b>leg</b> that was so severe {{it had to be}} amputated. The injury made it impossible for Clark to continue to operate his mill and live independently. As a result, he moved to Locust Grove, a farm eight miles (13km) from the growing town of Louisville, and {{became a member of the}} household of his sister, Lucy, and brother-in-law, Major William Croghan, a planter.|$|E

5000|$|Also {{known as}} a foot stomp, this attack sees a wrestler stamp his foot on any part of a fallen opponent. One {{variation}} of the stomp sees a wrestler perform a series of stomps all over {{the body of a}} fallen opponent in the order of left arm, left chest, left stomach, left upper leg, left lower <b>leg,</b> <b>right</b> lower <b>leg,</b> <b>right</b> upper <b>leg,</b> <b>right</b> stomach, right chest, right arm, and finally the jaw.

5|$|As Barksdale's men pushed toward Sickles's {{headquarters}} {{near the}} Trostle barn, the general {{and his staff}} began {{to move to the}} rear, when a cannonball caught Sickles in the <b>right</b> <b>leg.</b> He was carried off in a stretcher, sitting up and puffing on his cigar, attempting to encourage his men. That evening his leg was amputated, and he returned to Washington, D.C. Gen. Birney assumed command of the III Corps, which was soon rendered ineffective as a fighting force.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1990s, Bradbury accidentally hit his leg while {{chopping}} firewood. Gangrene set in, and his <b>right</b> <b>leg</b> was amputated {{below the}} knee.

He was {{survived by his wife}} Lois, who died in January 1998, and his three sons. A funeral service was held in Los Alamos, and he was buried at Guaje Pines Cemetery in Los Alamos.|$|E

In 2000, {{when he was}} 19 years old, his <b>right</b> <b>leg</b> was amputated {{above the}} knee {{following}} a serious motorcycle accident. He took up running again after being fitted with a prosthesis, and participated in his first race in 2004. The following year, he was selected to represent Great Britain at the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) European Championships, and took the bronze medal in the 200metres (sport class T42).|$|E
5|$|Many adult insects use six {{legs for}} walking and {{have adopted a}} tripedal gait. The tripedal gait allows for rapid walking while always having a stable stance and has been studied {{extensively}} in cockroaches and ants. The legs are used in alternate triangles touching the ground. For the first step, the middle <b>right</b> <b>leg</b> and {{the front and rear}} left legs are in contact with the ground and move the insect forward, while the front and rear <b>right</b> <b>leg</b> and the middle left leg are lifted and moved forward to a new position. When they touch the ground to form a new stable triangle the other legs can be lifted and brought forward in turn and so on. The purest form of the tripedal gait is seen in insects moving at high speeds. However, this type of locomotion is not rigid and insects can adapt a variety of gaits. For example, when moving slowly, turning, avoiding obstacles, climbing or slippery surfaces, four (tetrapod) or more feet (wave-gait) may be touching the ground. Insects can also adapt their gait to cope with the loss of one or more limbs.|$|E
5|$|Originally from Ghana, Aidoo played college {{football}} for the McMaster Marauders from 1998 to 2002. Aidoo was most successful during the 2000 season, {{when he broke}} conference records for rushing yards and touchdowns. His performance earned him the Hec Crighton Trophy as the most outstanding university football player in Canada, and he was honored with numerous other accolades. After breaking his <b>right</b> <b>leg</b> while filming Brian's Song, Aidoo missed most of his final two seasons with the Marauders.|$|E

40|$|Lateralisation (i. e. {{functional}} and/or structural specialisations of {{left and}} right sides of the brain) of aggressive traits has been studied {{in a number of}} vertebrates, while evidence for invertebrates is scarce. Mosquito females display aggressive responses against undesired males, performing rejection kicks with the hind legs. In this research, we examined lateralisation of kicking behaviour in females of the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus. We found a right-biased population-level lateralisation of kicking behaviour. Four repeated testing phases onmosquito females confirmed the preferential use of <b>right</b> <b>legs.</b> However, when left legs were used, the mean number of kicks per rejection event was not different to that performed with <b>right</b> <b>legs.</b> Both {{left and right}} kicking behaviour lead to successful displacement of undesired partners. This is the first report about behavioural lateralisation in mosquitoes...|$|R
50|$|Hod is the {{tendency}} to control and break down energy into different forms, the two forms being contending and balancing forces.

5|$|Planet Terror makes {{heavy use}} of digital effects {{throughout}} the film. Perhaps {{the most notable}} effect is Cherry's (Rose McGowan) fake leg. To accomplish the fake leg that Cherry sports after her accident, during post-production the effects teams digitally removed McGowan's <b>right</b> <b>leg</b> from the shots {{and replaced it with}} computer-generated props—first a table leg and then an M16 rifle. During shooting for these scenes, McGowan wore a special cast which restricted her leg movement to give her the correct motion, and helped the effects artists to digitally remove it during post-production.|$|E
5|$|The Marathon {{began on}} April 12, 1980, when Fox dipped his <b>right</b> <b>leg</b> in the Atlantic Ocean near St. John's, Newfoundland, and filled two large bottles with ocean water.

5|$|Crystal Palace Football Club {{was formed}} on 10 September 1905 {{playing in the}} Aston Villa colours of claret and blue. The choice of colours {{was a result of}} the {{important}} role in the club's formation played by Edmund Goodman, an Aston Villa employee who was recommended to the fledgling club by the Villa chairman, William McGregor. Goodman organised the business side of the club and managed the team from 1907 to 1925. A former amateur player with Villa, Goodman had lost his <b>right</b> <b>leg</b> after an injury led to amputation. Goodman hired John Robson from Middlesbrough to be the team's manager. Robson had transformed his previous club from an amateur side to an established Football League First Division side.|$|E
