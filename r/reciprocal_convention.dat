40|$|We {{requested}} Mr. Bagenal, {{one of our}} body, to make enquiries as to what {{impediments to}} the trade between The United Kingdom and America exist in the port of Dublin; and he wrote to the United States consul. The answer, in effect, was that the chief complaints were a lack of power {{to act on the}} side of the local authorities as well as {{on the side of the}} consul; that the United States and the United Kingdom have no treaty regarding sailors; that police aid to recover deserters is extended sometimes, and that by courtesy only. The consul 2 ̆ 7 s note ended with a suggestion that a <b>reciprocal</b> <b>convention</b> between the two countries would arrange matters satisfactorily...|$|E
40|$|The International Association of Agricultural Librarians and Documentalists (IAALD) has {{understood}} {{since its}} creation (in 1955) that {{the access to}} the primary documents and namely for the non-conventional ones is essetial in agriculture for everyone in all countries all over the world, and that the 2500 agricultural libraries (in 1980) need an internationally supported structure {{in order to promote}} their cooperation. AGLINET (AGricultural LIbrary NETwork) was crete in November 1971, under the coordination of David Lubin library of the FAO. The principle of the system is the reciprocal non commercial availability of catalogs and the photocopy supplying or lending services. In the same period the need for an agricultural bibliographic database, accessible in the developing countries is discussed by IAALD conference. AGRIS is create in 1974 under FAO coordination. Its principle is the participation of a great nomber of countries by putting into the database the bibliographic descriptions of the conventional, but also non-conventional literature issued on their own territory. The national and international centres are responsible for collecting and making available the national and international output of grey literature. Since the beginning of AGRIS a special tag pointing non conventional documents is create (the bibliographic indicator V) and a field in the bibliographic description receives the complete address of availability. The <b>reciprocal</b> <b>convention</b> which relies all AGRIS participants to provide each other the primary documents hold by the country of origin reinforces the work of AGLINET. The second common AGLINETcatalogue of periodicals (1985) comprised the 3700 titles most frequently cited in AGRIS, with their location in the AGLINET libraries. Participation to AGRIS has permitted the developing countries to became conscians of the importance of their own grey litterature and also create their own national agricultural bibliography. From 1975 to now, near 400 000 descriptions of grey documents are present in AGRIS database (20 per cent of all the descriptions). An analysis of the document types, country of origin, annaual increase and their occurrence in CAB is given. Includes : Conference preprint, Pratt student commentaryXAInternationa...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{pedagogical}} {{review of the}} phenomenology of CP violation, with emphasis on B decays. Main topics include the phenomenology of neutral meson systems, CP violation in the Standard Model of electroweak interactions, and B decays. We {{stress the importance of}} the <b>reciprocal</b> basis, sign <b>conventions,</b> rephasing invariance, general definitions of the CP transformation and the spurious phases they bring about, CP violation as originating from the clash of two contributions, the rho-eta plane, the four phases of a generalized CKM matrix, and the impact of discrete ambiguities. Specific B decays are included in order to illustrate some general techniques used in extracting information from B physics experiments. We include a series of simple exercises. The style is informal. Comment: Invited lectures at the Central European School in Particle Physics; 94 pages; format appropriate to print two pages per physical pag...|$|R
2500|$|This rough {{classification}} can {{be quantified}} by various definitions to express the moneyness as a number, measuring how far the asset is in the money {{or out of the}} money with respect to the strike – or conversely how far a strike is in or out of the money with respect to the spot (or forward) price of the asset. This quantified notion of moneyness is most importantly used in defining the relative volatility surface: the implied volatility in terms of moneyness, rather than absolute price. The most basic of these measures is simple moneyness, which is the ratio of spot (or forward) to strike, or the <b>reciprocal,</b> depending on <b>convention.</b> A particularly important measure of moneyness is the likelihood that the derivative will expire in the money, in the risk-neutral measure. It can be measured in percentage probability of expiring in the money, which is the forward value of a binary call option with the given strike, ...|$|R

It can be measured in percentage probability of expiring in the money, which is the forward value of a binary call option with the given strike,and is equal to the auxiliary N(d2) term in the Black-Scholes formula. This can also be measured in standard deviations, measuring how far above or below the strike price the current price is, in terms of volatility; this quantity is given by d2. (Standard deviations refer to the price fluctuations of the underlying instrument, not of the option itself.) Another measure closely related to moneyness is the Delta of a call or put option. There are other proxies for moneyness, with convention depending on market.|$|R
