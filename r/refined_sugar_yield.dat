In this trial, the eight fertilization variants of N, P 2 O 5 and K 2 O increased amounts were studied. Sugar beet root and tops yields were determined, {{as well as the}} elements of technological sugar beet root quality. Based on these results, percentage of sugar utilization and <b>refined</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>yield</b> was defined. In the spring, before applying of N fertilizer, amount of nitrate nitrogen in the soil and its influence on yield and quality was determined. The highest root yield in 2002 was produced at the variant N 100 P 150 K 150, and in 2003 at the variant N 150 P 150 K 150. However, in both years, referring to the variant N 100 P 100 K 100, the differences were not statistically significant.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was performed to}} determine the effects of using humic acid with irrigation on quantitative and qualitative yield traits of sugar beet grown on calcareous soils in Esfaraen, located in the North-East of Iran. Treatments consisted of three levels of humic acid concentration (zero or control, 2. 5 and 5 L ha - 1) and the number of applications (once 45 days after planting; twice, 45 and 75 days after planting; three times, respectively 45, 75 and 105 days after planting). The effect of the two experimental factors on sugar beet yield traits such as the content of sucrose, refined sugar, molasses forming substances, root yield and <b>refined</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>yield</b> were evaluated. The results proved the existence of a significant interaction between humic acid concentration and the number of applications on all parameters under study. The application of humic acid caused a significant increase of sucrose, refined sugar, root yield and <b>refined</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>yield</b> and a reduction in molasses forming substances content, compared to the control. The increased amount of sucrose and refined sugar content in all applications in concentration of 2. 5 L ha - 1 humic acid was more than with 5 L ha - 1. Similarly, the content of molasses forming substances showed more reduction in 2. 5 L ha - 1 than in 5 L ha - 1 treatment. However, the results revealed that the highest root yield and <b>refined</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>yield,</b> as the main qualitative and quantitative parameters of sugar beet yield, were achieved by three times application of 5 L ha - 1 that had 24 and 37 % increase compared to control. </p...|$|E

Validate and refine parameters, which affect ethanol yield such as detoxification conditions mentioned above, and to fermenter conditions such as temperature, pH adjustment, aeration, nutrients, and charging sequence. Materials of construction will be evaluated also.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effects of micronutrients on quantitative and qualitative yield traits of sugar beet, an experiment was performed during growing season of 2013 - 2014 in the Esfarayen region, located in the North-East of Iran. Treatments consisted of three levels of mixture of micronutrients (spraying with 0, 1, 2 L ha- 1) {{and the number of}} applications (once 45 days after planting; twice, 45 and 75 days after planting; three times, respectively 45, 75 and 105 days after planting). The results revealed the highest root yield was obtained with the spraying 2 L ha- 1 of the micronutrients. Foliar spraying of micronutrients significantly increased content of sucrose and refined sugar compared to the control. The highest percentage of sucrose and refined sugar (75 % and 74. 45 %) was recorded by spraying of mixture of micronutrients twice at the rate of 2 L ha- 1. Micronutrient concentrations and the number of applications as well as their interaction effect had significant effects on the content of molasses forming substances. The highest amount of these compounds occurred in the control treatment and reduced by applying the micronutrient. Foliar spray of micronutrients added to the <b>refined</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>yield</b> so that in all times of application the highest <b>refined</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>yield</b> was obtained by 2 L ha- 1 spraying. Generally, it could be recommended that fertilizing sugar beet plants by spraying 2 L ha- 1 of the micronutrients at 45, 75 and 105 days after planting produce the highest productivity and quality of sugar beet under this study...|$|E

40|$|Effects of {{potassium}} (K), magnesium (Mg), and sulphur (S) containing fertilizers on root yield, <b>refined</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>yield,</b> and K, Mg, and S concentrations of leaf of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) were studied on 3 different locations in Konya province, namely Kuzucu, Karaarslan, and Alakova, in 2004, 2005, and 2006. In the trails, a uniform diammonium phosphate (DAP) + urea application {{was used as}} the control treatment, while potassium sulphate and Mg containing Kalimagnesia, were applied at varying rate combinations. Compared to the control treatment (DAP + urea), all fertilizer treatments containing K, Mg, and S increased root yield in the Kuzucu and Alakova locations, while in the Karararslan location only potassium sulphate treatment improved root yield. The Kalimagnesia fertilizer containing all 3 nutrients, namely K, Mg, and S, enhanced root yield by 42 % and 39 % in the Kuzucu and Alakova locations, respectively. But, this yield-stimulating effect of the Kalimagnesia fertilizer was rate-dependent. Kalimagnesia was also effective in improving the sugar content of the root, while the amino-N levels were not consistently affected by the fertilizer treatments. Despite increases in the leaf concentrations of K, Mg, and S by the tested fertilizers, the changes in the leaf concentrations of these nutrients could not fully explain the increases in root yields. In the discussion of the results, the possible role of basic cation saturation ratios of soils was also taken into consideration. The results indicate that a fertilizer treatment including 81 kg K 2 O ha(- 1), 27 kg Mg ha(- 1), and 46 kg S ha(- 1) may be recommendable in fertilization of sugar beets, together with regular nitrogen and phosphorus applications, under similar conditions, in order to achieve a balanced mineral nutrition and sustain better root and sugar yields...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} the intake of <b>refined</b> <b>sugar</b> in Australian children and adolescents, aged 2 – 18 years. Design: Foods contributing to total sugar intake were identified {{using data from}} the National Nutrition Survey 1995 (NNS 95), the most recent national dietary survey of the Australian population. The top 100 foods represented means of 85 % (range 79 – 91 %) and 82 % (range 78 – 85 %) of total sugar intake for boys and girls, respectively. Using published Australian food composition data (NUTTAB 95), the proportion of total <b>sugar</b> being <b>refined</b> <b>sugar</b> was estimated for each food. Where published food composition data were not available, calculations from ingredients and manufac-turer’s information were used. Subjects: The NNS 95 assessed the dietary intake of a random sample of the Australian population, aged 2 – 18 years (n 3007). Results: Mean daily intakes of <b>refined</b> <b>sugar</b> ranged from 26. 9 to 78. 3 g for 2 – 18 -year-old girls, representing 6. 6 – 14. 8 % of total energy intake. Corresponding figures for boys were 27. 0 to 81. 6 g and 8. 0 – 14. 0 %, respectively. Of the 10 highest sources of <b>refined</b> <b>sugar</b> for each age group, sweetened beverages, especially cola-type beverages, were the most prominent. Conclusion: <b>Refined</b> <b>sugar</b> is an important contributor to dietary energy in Australian children. Sweetened beverages such as soft drinks and cordials were substantial sources of <b>refined</b> <b>sugar</b> and represent a potential target for campaigns to reduce <b>refined</b> <b>sugar</b> intake. Better access to information on the amounts of sugar added to processed food is essential for appropriate monitoring of this important energy source...|$|R
