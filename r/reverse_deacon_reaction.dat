40|$|Rates of dehydroxylation of two Nd-doped {{metaphosphate}} laser glasses (LG- 770 and LHG- 8) {{are measured}} and modeled. Glass melts {{ranging in size}} from 100 g to 2. 8 kg were bubbled with 02 containing various H 20 partial pressures (PH 20) and with 02 /C 12 mixtures at temperatures ranging from 925 - 13 () O°C. The OH content in the glass was measured by monitoring the OH absorption at 3. 333 im at various bubbling times. The OH removal by inert gas bubbling (e. g. 02 bubbling) is governed by the transport (diffusion) of OH to the glass liquid/vapor interface and by the chemical equilibrium between OH at the surface and H 20 in the gas phase. The equilibrium OH content in glass melts bubbled with 02 containing different PH 2 O varies as PH 2 O 1 '. Reactive gas dehydroxylation (using Cl 2 bubbling) is enhanced by the <b>reverse</b> <b>Deacon</b> <b>reaction</b> where Cl 2 gas reacts with H 2 O in the gas phase to form HCI. A time-dependent, one-dimensional bubble-column dehydroxylation model is developed and used to describe the rates of dehydroxylation for glasses.

40|$|In the {{presence}} of heavy metal containing chloride melts, metallic materials show a strongly accelerated corrosion. In this work, the influences of the elements Fe, Cr, Ni and Si and the partial pressures of O 2 and HCl on the salt melt-induced high temperature corrosion have been studied, {{as well as the}} quantity of the chloride deposit. Primarily, thermogravimetric investigations have been conducted on the pure metals Fe, Cr and Ni but also on the alloys Alloy 625, Alloy 625 Si and Fe- 10 %Cr, which have been covered by a chloride mixture containing 50 mol. % ZnCl 2 and 50 mol. % KCl. The experiments have been carried out in Ar - O 2 - and Ar - O 2 - HCl-containing atmospheres at 320 °C. The studies were complemented by experiments on the solubility of metals in a 50 mol. % ZnCl 2 - 50 mol. % KCl melt. Thermodynamic calculations have been done for the interpretation of the results. The exposure of Fe covered by a ZnCl 2 - KCl deposit in O 2 -containing atmospheres results in an increased corrosion rate. 3 kinetic stages have been observed: a: an incubation phase, b: a linear stage and c: a stage that follows either a logarithmic or a parabolic rate law. It was shown that the kinetic constants depend on the amount of the salt deposit and on the oxygen concentration in the gas atmosphere. According to thermodynamic calculations the partial pressure of Cl 2 is established by the oxidation of ZnCl 2 to ZnO and Cl 2. The reason for the intense corrosion is attributed to the high solubility of FeCl 2 in the 50 mol. % ZnCl 2 - 50 mol. % KCl melt, which was demonstrated by a newly developed phase diagram. The addition of HCl to the reaction gas generally yields an increased formation of iron chloride and a further acceleration of the corrosion rate. This traces back to the formation of Cl 2 by the oxidation of HCl in the gas atmosphere. Furthermore, thermogravimetric experiments also show evaporation of iron chloride and zinc chloride. In contrast, in Ar - O 2 - H 2 O-atmospheres a lower mass gain has been detected at longer exposure times. The reduction of the Cl 2 partial pressure by the reaction of Cl 2 with H 2 O forming HCl and O 2 (<b>reverse</b> <b>Deacon</b> <b>reaction)</b> is the main reason for this behaviour. Chromium covered by ZnCl 2 - KCl shows in Ar - O 2 still a relatively good corrosion resistance, which however decreases significantly by adding HCl. In Ar - 8 vol. % O 2 - 1000 vppm HCl a very complex kinetics is observed which has two stages showing a mass gain and one stage showing a mass loss. During corrosion, chromium chloride is formed that reacts partially by forming chromium oxide and chromate during a subsequent stage. Ni shows in both, Ar - O 2 - and Ar - O 2 - HCl-containing atmospheres a quite good corrosion resistance beneath the chloride melt. The addition of HCl increases the mass gain only slightly in comparison to Fe and Cr. For the interpretation of the possible reason, thermodynamic calculations show on the one hand that the standard free energy of formation of NiO is slightly higher than that of NiCl 2 {{and on the other hand}} that NiCl 2 is scarcely soluble in the ZnCl 2 - KCl melt. Alloy 625 and Alloy 625 Si react in Ar - 8 vol. % O 2 in {{the presence}} of a ZnCl 2 - KCl-melt by showing a low mass change. During the reaction of both alloys in Ar - 8 vol. % O 2 - 2000 vppm HCl and in {{the presence of}} the chloride melt, an accelerated corrosion was detected. Even in this case relatively large quantities of a chromium-rich chloride appear as corrosion product. Beyond that a negative effect on the corrosion behaviour arises also from the alloying element Si. Fe- 10 %Cr covered by a ZnCl 2 - KCl-deposit shows a strongly accelerated corrosion in Ar - 8 vol. % O 2 as well as in Ar - 8 vol. % O 2 - 2000 vppm HCl. The thermodynamically favoured reaction of chromium chloride to oxide, the formation of iron chloride, supported by the release of chlorine, and the solubility of iron chloride in the ZnCl 2 - KCl-melt are to be noted as possible reasons for that. A comparison of thermogravimetrically determined mass gains for the corrosion of Fe beneath 50 mol. % ZnCl 2 - 50 mol. % KCl with mass gains, simulated by a modelling program shows in general a relatively good congruence. However, discrepancies exist in reference to the parabolic/logarithmic stage and to the chemical composition of the scale. Finally, this work showed that the element nickel might most likely reduce the susceptibility of metallic materials to corrosion under the investigated conditions. In contrast, chromium has a disadvantageous effect on the corrosion behaviour. Alloying silicon to nickel-base alloys also results in a decrease of the corrosion resistance...|$|E

More gas-phase chlorobenzenes and chlorophenols were emitted from the incineration of inorganic chloride than organic chloride. With additive CaO, the emission rate of HCl and the formations of chlorobenzenes and chlorophenols through <b>Deacon</b> <b>Reactions</b> were reduced, especially at higher operation temperature 800 degrees C.

Incineration of organic chloride produced more dioxins than inorganic chloride. Adding CaO could reduce the formations and TEQ of dioxins in the incineration of organic chloride, but increased that in the incineration of inorganic chloride.

40|$|Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and {{polychlorinated dibenzofurans}} (PCDD/Fs) {{constitute}} {{a group of}} persistent organic pollutants that form almost inexorably in all thermal and combustion operations. This review focuses on mechanisms that govern their formation, chlorination, dechlorination and destruction. As a consequence of their extreme toxicity and propensity to bioaccumulate, PCDD/Fs {{have been subjected to}} much scientific research, designed to understand mechanisms and conditions that govern their emission rates and congener distribution (fingerprints). Consensus of opinions in the literature points to heterogeneous pathways contributing substantially more in the total yield of PCDD/Fs in combustion systems than the gas phase pathway. However, in our view, a great complexity of both homogeneous and heterogeneous routes and uncertainties in many thermochemical and rate parameters enable no conclusive statement about the contribution of each route. Chlorination patterns of precursors appear {{to play a major role}} in final congener profiles of PCDD/F emissions. According to the most recent theoretical studies, these congener profiles seem consistent with thermodynamic stabilities of dioxins and furans produced in thermal processes, however, further theoretical investigations at more accurate levels are needed to clarify this matter further. Theoretical studies along with experimental findings reveal that the PCDD/PCDF ratio remains very sensitive to the operating conditions, with pyrolytic conditions favouring the formation of PCDFs. A number of reaction mechanisms has been proposed to answer many of the most intriguing questions about the formation of PCDD/Fs. These mechanisms include models of gaseous and heterogeneous reactions, often inferred from theoretical quantum chemical calculations studies, which incorporate steps responsible for formation, chlorination, dechlorination and destruction of dioxins and furans.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) In this Thesis, {{the role}} of copper in {{catalysing}} the HCl oxidation (<b>Deacon)</b> <b>reaction</b> is explored theoretically from first principles {{as part of a}} larger project aimed at understanding the formation of toxic and environmentally harmful materials polychlorinated dibenzo–p–dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans. The Thesis deployed both density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio atomistic thermodynamics. The DFT calculations were adopted to identify various gas-gas and gas-copper-surface structures and their energetic stabilities, and predict steps of chemical reactions to explain the interaction of copper with the species involved. Ab initio atomistic thermodynamics method was used to extrapolate the T = 0 K and p = 0 bar DFT results to the experimental T and p conditions by calculating surface free energies for the gas-surfaces stable structures as a function of chlorine or oxygen chemical potentials (at various p and T). This helped to determine the active species for a chemical reaction, which is one of the most important factors in understanding the heterogeneous catalysis. For the gas phase oxidation of hydrogen chloride in the presence of copper (II) chloride it was found that chlorine (Cl₂) is produced by the thermal decomposition of CuCl₂ generating Cu₂Cl₂ which reacts with O₂ (³Σg) to form several intermediates and complexes which further react with hydrogen chloride. The fission of a O-O linkage between two Cu₂Cl₂ moieties was identified as a key step in this process. However, this step possesses a barrier prohibitive to homogeneous gas phase catalysis but one which is expected to be easily overcome on a copper base catalyst. For the gas-surface interactions, the Thesis studies the adsorption of oxygen and chlorine on the low-index Cu(100) and Cu(110) surfaces. For Cu(100) it is found that the presence of atomic chlorine increases the stability of adsorbed molecular oxygen, and that the barrier required to dissociate the oxygen molecule in the presence of chlorine is three times larger than the dissociation barrier of molecular oxygen on clean Cu(100). In addition, chlorine monoxide was generated on the surface when molecular oxygen was adsorbed horizontally into a hollow site immediately adjacent to atomic chlorine. The calculations indicate that while chlorine is easily adsorbed dissociatively on the clean Cu(100) surface, it is stable in the molecular form in the presence of atomic oxygen. The presence of chlorine leads to the production of sub-surface atomic oxygen and enables an oxygen atom to go into the Cu bulk with a small activation energy barrier. Calculations using ab initio atomistic thermodynamics showed that for Cl/Cu(100) and coverages up to 1 / 2 ML, the 1 / 2 ML c(2 × 2) -Cl phase with Cl atoms adsorbed on the hollow site is the most stable structure at room temperature, in agreement with experiment. The 1 / 9 ML and 1 / 4 ML structures show some stability at very low pressures of chlorine, and elevated temperatures. At high coverages, the stable structures were found to be only kinetically accessible. The subsurface adsorption of Cl atoms, however, dramatically increases the stability of the 1 ML and 2 ML adsorption configurations providing a possible pathway for the formation of the bulk-chloride surface phases in the kinetic regime. In order to understand {{the role of}} copper in catalysing the HCl oxidation (<b>Deacon)</b> <b>reaction,</b> its mechanism on the Cu(100) surface is investigated using DFT. The mechanism of water formation on the Cu(100) surface was found to consist of three major steps; these are: (1) oxygen adsorption and dissociation, (2) OH formation and (3) H₂O formation and desorption. The most preferred pathway for the OH formation step involved the reaction of gaseous HCl molecule with an adsorbed O atom on the surface obeying the Eley-Rideal mechanism. Energetics and transition states were reported for different pathways of each step. It is shown that while water can be formed easily on the Cu(100) surface, Cl₂ is not the result of the direct oxidation of HCl molecules. An ab initio atomistic thermodynamics technique was utilised to study the thermodynamic stability of different O-Cl/Cu(100) structures. It is shown that the high coverages of both Cl and O (1 / 2 ML-Cl // 1 / 2 ML-O) are only kinetically accessible. The subsurface adsorption of oxygen, however, was appeared to increase the stability of this structure providing a possible pathway for bulk-like Cu₂Cl₂O formation in the kinetic regime. The formation of the latter structure was found to be a prerequisite for Cl₂ formation and liberation on the Cu(100) surface. For Cl/Cu(110), the 1 / 2 ML c(2 × 2) -Cl structure was found to be the most stable for coverages ≤ 1 / 2 ML at room temperature, in agreement with experiment. However, the predicted short bridge site for the most stable c(2 × 2) -Cl structure on Cu(110) differs from the experimentally proposed hollow position. Beyond 1 / 2 ML coverage, the (2 × 3) -Cl and (1 × 4) -Cl configurations were predicted to be the most stable for 2 / 3 ML and 3 / 4 ML coverage, respectively. As for Cu(100), the high Cl coverage stable structures on Cu(110) were also found to be only kinetically accessible. By incorporating the results from previous work of Cl adsorption on Cu(111), the morphologies of a copper nano-structure terminated by the low-index Cu(100), Cu(110) and Cu(111) surfaces in a chlorine environment were predicted using the Wulff construction. It was determined that the (100) planes become predominant with increasing chlorine concentration resulting in a cubical crystal shape, in agreement with the experimental observations...|$|R
40|$|The {{heterogeneously}} catalyzed gas-phase oxidation of HCl to Cl 2 (<b>Deacon</b> <b>reaction)</b> is an energy-efficient {{and sustainable}} route to recycle chlorine from HCl-containing industrial waste streams. This work investigates HCl oxidation over CeO 2 using in situ and ex situ characterization techniques, and provides molecular understanding of Deacon chemistry over ceria catalysts. The reactivity {{and stability of}} CeO 2 in HCl oxidation were assessed by steady-state kinetic experiments, which indicate that The heterogeneously catalyzed gas-phase oxidation of HCl to Cl 2 (<b>Deacon</b> <b>reaction)</b> is an energy-efficient and sustainable route to recycle chlorine from HCl-containing industrial waste streams. This work investigates HCl oxidation over CeO 2 using in situ and ex situ characterization techniques, and provides molecular understanding of Deacon chemistry over ceria catalysts. The reactivity and stability of CeO 2 in HCl oxidation were assessed by steady-state kinetic experiments, which indicate that CeO 2 is an efficient catalyst for Cl 2 recycling in the temperature range of 623 - 723 K. A structural-reactivity correlation obtained by the assessment of sample pretreatment effects, particularly calcination, on reactivity reveals that ceria samples calcined at mildly high temperature (1173 K) represent the best compromise between performance and stability. Calcination at this temperature optimizes both the number of vacancies and the structural stability of the catalyst. Because of the semiconductor nature of CeO 2, HCl oxidation over CeO 2 catalysts requires the redox chemistry of the catalyst as well, and thus O vacancies are expected to play a crucial role. X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy of samples exposed to reaction feeds with different O 2 :HCl ratios provide evidence that CeO 2 does not suffer from bulk chlorination in O 2 -rich feeds (O 2 :HCl ≥ 0. 75), while it does form chlorinated phases in stoichiometric or sub-stoichiometric feeds (O 2 :HCl ≤ 0. 25). The quantitative analysis of the chlorine uptake by thermogravimetry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicates that chlorination under O 2 -rich conditions is confined {{to the surface and}} possibly one subsurface layer of CeO 2 particles. Density functional theory simulations reveal that Cl activation from vacancy positions to surface Ce atoms is the most energy-demanding step, although chlorine-oxygen competition for the available active sites may render re-oxidation as the rate-determining step. Since the surface of CeO 2 is prone to chlorination upon exposure to the reaction gas mixture, and hence the active surface phase comprises Cl species in its structure, the stability and reactivity of CeOCl as a possible active phase for <b>Deacon</b> <b>reaction</b> were investigated using various feed compositions at 703 K. CeOCl was synthesized by the solid state reaction of cerium oxide and anhydrous cerium chloride. X-ray diffraction of post-reaction samples revealed that CeOCl is unstable, in both oxygen-rich and lean conditions. A complete transformation of CeOCl into CeO 2 was observed by applying oxygen over-stoichiometric feeds. Considerable HCl conversions were obtained only after this transformation, which confirms the essential role of bulk cerium oxide in this catalytic system, probably by facilitating efficient O 2 activation via bulk and surface O-vacancy dynamics. The impact of surface chlorination on the acid/base properties of ceria (fresh and after reaction) was investigated by probe molecule adsorption (CO 2, NH 3, CO) applying micro-calorimetry, FTIR, TPD and DFT calculations. Micro-calorimetric experiments with CO 2 adsorption indicate that the basic character of CeO 2 has been essentially eliminated upon reaction in HCl oxidation indicating that most of the basic lattice O sites are exchanged by chlorine and that the OH groups formed are rather acidic. Thus, HCl adsorption is certainly retarded by the loss of basic (O 2 -) sites required for H abstraction during dissociative HCl adsorption. Furthermore, FTIR and TPD adsorption experiments using NH 3 and CO as probing molecules reveal that the density and the strength of surface acidic functions increased significantly upon reaction. EPR experiments were carried out on fresh and post-reaction samples using O 2 as probing molecule to assess the effect of surface chlorination on the amount surface O vacancies required for O 2 activation. The results strongly suggest that oxygen activation is inhibited by the high degree of surface chlorination. The coverage of most abundant surface intermediates, OH and Cl, were monitored by in situ infrared spectroscopy and in situ PGAA under various conditions. Higher temperature and p(O 2) led to enhanced OH coverage, reduced Cl coverage and increased reactivity. Variation of p(HCl) gave rise to opposite correlations, while raising p(Cl 2) did not induce any measurable increase in the Cl coverage, despite the strong inhibition of the reaction rate. The results indicate that {{only a small fraction of}} surface sites is actively involved in the reaction, and most of the surface species probed in the in situ observations are spectators. Kinetics of surface/bulk chlorination and dechlorination was investigated by means of in situ PGAA experiments. Using variable reaction conditions (T, pi) the in situ PGAA studies revealed that the chlorination rate is independent of the pre-chlorination degree but increases at lower oxygen over-stoichiometry, while dechlorination is effective in O 2 -rich feeds, and its rate is higher for a more extensively pre-chlorinated ceria. The role of trivalent (La, Sm, Gd, and Y) and tetravalent (Hf, Zr, and Ti) dopants in the catalytic, structural, and electronic properties of ceria was also investigated. Promoted ceria catalysts were synthesized by co-precipitation with ammonia and tested in HCl oxidation. The intrinsic reactivity of ceria was improved by a factor of 2 when doping with Hf and Zr in appropriate quantities, whereas trivalent dopants are detrimental. The effects of promoters on the electronic conductivity and the vacancy formation energy were studied by contactless conductivity experiments using the microwave cavity perturbation technique and by DFT calculations. In HCl oxidation, only the balanced reduction of both Cl and O vacancy formation energies allows for an enhanced reactivity. Promoters give rise to lattice contraction−expansion modifying vacancy formation energies, adsorption properties, and surface coverage. Die heterogen katalysierte Gasphasenoxidation von HCl zu Cl 2 (Deacon Reaktion) ist eine energieeffiziente und nachhaltige Methode, Chlor aus chlorwasserstoffhaltigen industriellen Abfallströmen zurückzugewinnen. Diese Arbeit untersucht die Oxidation von HCl über CeO 2 mit Hilfe von in situ und ex situ Charakterisierungsmethoden und liefert ein Verständnis zur Deacon Chemie über CeO 2 Katalysatoren auf molekularer Ebene. Die Reaktivität und Stabilität von CeO 2 in der HCl-Oxidation wurde mit Hilfe von kinetischen Experimenten im stationären Zustand untersucht, welche zeigen, dass CeO 2 ein effizienter Katalysator für die Wiedergewinnung von Cl 2 im Temperaturbereich von 623 - 723 K ist. Eine Korrelation von Struktur und Reaktivität, welche durch die Untersuchung des Einflusses der Probenvorbehandlung, insbesondere der Kalzinierung, auf die Reaktivität erhalten wurde, zeigt, dass Proben von Ceroxid, kalziniert bei mäßig hoher Temperatur (1173 K), den optimalen Kompromiss zwischen Leistung und Stabilität darstellen. Die Kalzinierung bei dieser Temperatur optimiert die Zahl an Leerstellen und die strukturelle Stabilität des Katalysators. Da CeO 2 ein Halbleiter ist, bedarf es zusätzlich seiner Redoxchemie für die Oxidation von HCl und es wird angenommen, dass dabei O-Leerstellen eine entscheidende Rolle spielen. Die Röntgenbeugung und die Elektronenmikroskopie an Proben, welche Reaktionsgasgemischen mit unterschiedlichem O 2 :HCl-Verhältnissen ausgesetzt wurden, zeigen, dass CeO 2 in O 2 -reichen Gasgemischen (O 2 :HCl ≥ 0. 75) keiner Chlorierung des Volumens unterliegt, während in (sub) -stöchiometrischen Gasgemischen (O 2 :HCl ≤ 0. 25) chlorhaltige Phasen gebildet werden. Die qualitative Analyse der Chloraufnahme durch Thermogravimetrie und Röntgenphotoelektronenspektroskopie weist darauf hin, dass sich die Chlorierung unter O 2 -reichen Bedingungen auf die Oberfläche und möglicherweise auf die erste Lage unterhalb der Oberfläche beschränkt. Rechnungen mit Hilfe der Dichtefunktionaltheorie stellen heraus, dass die Chloraktivierung von Leerstellenpositionen zu Ce-Oberflächenatomen der energieaufwändigste Schritt ist, obwohl die Konkurrenz von Chlor und Sauerstoff um die verfügbaren akitven Zentren die Re-Oxidation als geschwindigkeitsbestimmende Schritt kennzeichnet. Da die Oberfläche von CeO 2 in Anwesenheit des Reaktivgases zur Chlorierung neigt und damit Chlor in die Struktur der aktiven Oberfläche eingebaut wird, wurde die Stabilität und Reaktivität von CeOCl als mögliche aktive Phase für die Deacon Reaktion in unterschiedlichen Reaktivgasgemischen bei 703 K untersucht. CeOCl wurde mittels Festkörperreaktion zwischen Ceroxid und wasserfreiem Cerchlorid erhalten. Röntgenbeugungsmessungen an Ausbauproben zeigten, dass CeOCl sowohl unter sauerstoffreichen als auch unter mageren Bedingungen instabil ist. In, hinsichtlich Sauerstoff, überstöchiometrischem Gasgemischen wurde eine vollständige Umsetzung von CeOCl in CeO 2 beobachtet. Nur dann wurden nennenswerte Umsätze von HCl erhalten, was die essentielle Rolle des Volumens von CeO 2 in diesem katalytischem System bestätigt. Wahrscheinlich geschieht dies durch eine erleichterte, effiziente Aktivierung von O 2 durch die Dynamik von Volumen- und Oberflächenleerstellen des Sauerstoffs. Der Einfluss der Oberflächenchlorierung auf die Säure-Base-Eigenschaften von Ceroxid wurde mittels Adsorption an Sondenmolekülen (CO 2, NH 3, CO) mit Mikrokalorimetrie, FTIR, TPD und DFT-Berechnungen sowohl an frischen Ceroxid als auch Ausbauproben untersucht. Mikrokalorimetrische Experimente mit Adsorption von CO 2 weisen darauf hin, dass der basische Charakter von CeO 2 während der HCl Oxidation im Wesentlichen verloren geht, was darauf hindeutet, dass der überwiegende Teil des Gittersauerstoffs durch Chlor ersetzt wurde und dass gebildete OH-Gruppen eher sauer reagieren. Damit wird die Adsorption von HCl höchstwahrscheinlich durch den Verlust basischer (O 2 -) Zentren, welche für die Abstraktion von H während der dissoziativen Adsorption benötigt werden, gehemmt. Weiterhin zeigen FTIR und TPD mit NH 3 und CO als Probemolekül, dass die Dichte und Stärke saurer Funktionalitäten auf der Oberfläche während der Reaktion zunimmt. EPR Experimente an frischen Proben und an Ausbauproben mit O 2 als Sondenmolekül wurden durchgeführt, um den Effekt der Oberflächenchlorierung auf die Menge von Sauerstofffehlstellen an der Oberfläche, welche zur O 2 -Aktivierung nötig sind, einschätzen zu können. Die Ergebnisse weisen darauf hin, dass die Sauerstoffaktivierung durch den hohen Grad an Chlorierung unterdrückt wird. Die Bedeckungen der wichtigsten Oberflächenintermediate, OH und Cl, wurden durch in situ Infrarot-Spektroskopie und in situ PGAA verfolgt. Höhere Temperaturen und höhere p(O 2) führen zu einer erhöhten Bedeckung mit OH, einer verminderten Bedeckung mit Cl und schließlich zu einer erhöhten Reaktivität. Die Änderung von p(HCl) führt zu entgegengesetzten Korrelationen, während die Erhöhung von p(Cl 2), trotz starker Unterdrückung der Reaktionsrate, keine messbare Erhöhung der Cl Bedeckung bewirkt. Diese Ergebnisse lassen vermuten, dass nur ein kleiner Teil der Oberflächenzentren aktiv an der Reaktion teilnimmt, während die meisten der untersuchten Oberflächenspezies, welche unter in situ Bedingungen beobachtet wurden, unbeteiligt sind. Die Kinetik der Oberflächen- und Volumenchlorierung und Dechlorierung wurde mit Hilfe von in situ PGAA Experimenten untersucht. Die unter verschiedenen Reaktionsbedingungen ausgeführten Experimente zeigen, dass die Chlorierungsgeschwindigkeit unabhängig vom Grad der Vorchlorierung ist, jedoch bei niedrigerer Überstöchiometrie von Sauerstoff ansteigt, während die Dechlorierung in sauerstoffreichen Gasgemischen effektiv ist. Diese Geschwindigkeit ist höher für ein stärker vorchloriertes Ceroxid. Die Rolle trivalenter (La, Sm, Gd und Y) und tetravalenter (Hf, Zr und Ti) Dotierungen für die katalytischen, strukturellen und elektronischen Eigenschaften von Ceroxid wurde ebenso untersucht. Promotiertes Ceroxid wurde mittel Co-Fällung mit Ammoniak dargestellt und in der HCl-Oxidation getestet. Die intrinsische Aktivität von Ceroxid wurde um Faktor 2 gesteigert, wenn mit Hf und Zr in adäquater Weise promotiert wurde, während sich trivalente Dotierungsmittel nachteilig auswirken. Der Effekt der Promotoren auf die elektronische Leitfähigkeit und die Bildungsenergie der Fehlstellen wurde mittels kontaktfreien Leitfähigkeitsexperimenten mit Hilfe der „Microwave perturbation technique“ und mit DFT-Berechnungen geprüft. In der HCl-Oxidation begünstigt nur eine gleichzeitige Reduktion von Cl- und O-Leerstellenbildungsenergien eine erhöhte Reaktivität. Promotoren verursachen eine Gitterkontraktion oder Expansion, was die Leerstellenbildungsenergien, die Adsorptionseigenschaften und die Oberflächenbedeckung modifiziert...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{stability}} {{is a major}} issue in heterogeneous catalysis and is often related to structural instabilities, which are difficult to assess in the early stage of catalyst screening. However, studies of morphological transformations in catalytic systems can greatly benefit from a well-defined starting morphology and microstructure of the catalyst to be analysed. The present study suggests the use of catalysts in the form of 1 ¿D nanofibres (NFs) as a conceptual methodology to assess catalyst stability, which is exemplified for the HCl oxidation reaction. These nanostructured model catalysts are synthesised by electrospinning, a versatile method to produce metal oxide NFs. We have studied the stability of RuO 2 - and CeO 2 -based materials in the harsh HCl oxidation <b>reaction</b> (<b>Deacon</b> process). At 573 K pure RuO 2 NFs have shown to be morphologically unstable, whereas mixed RuO 2 -TiO 2 NFs are stable. The stability of CeO 2 -based NFs in the HCl oxidation was studied at 703 K. Under HCl lean conditions CeO 2 NFs are stable, whereas under HCl rich conditions pure CeO 2 NFs disintegrate by recrystallisation, forming (hydrated) Ce-chloride. If CeO 2 is doped with 20 ¿% of Zr, the resulting mixed oxide Zr 0. 20 Ce 0. 80 O 2 NFs have shown to be stable even under HCl rich reaction conditions and are similarly active as pure CeO 2. These are the first activity experiments of mixed oxide ZrxCe 1 -xO 2 in the Deacon process. The versatility of electrospun NFs as model catalysts has been demonstrated for testing catalyst stability in terms of morphology changes, thus serving as a proof-of-principle study...|$|R
