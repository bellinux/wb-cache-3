40|$|Abstract Background Pathogen {{detection}} using DNA microarrays has {{the potential}} to become a fast and comprehensive diagnostics tool. However, since pathogen detection chips currently utilize <b>random</b> <b>primers</b> rather than specific primers for the RT-PCR step, bias inherent in random PCR amplification becomes a serious problem that causes large inaccuracies in hybridization signals. Results In this paper, we study how the efficiency of random PCR amplification affects hybridization signals. We describe a model that predicts the amplification efficiency of a given <b>random</b> <b>primer</b> on a target viral genome. The prediction allows us to filter false-negative probes of the genome that lie in regions of poor random PCR amplification and improves the accuracy of pathogen detection. Subsequently, we propose LOMA, an algorithm to generate <b>random</b> <b>primers</b> that have good amplification efficiency. Wet-lab validation showed that the generated <b>random</b> <b>primers</b> improve the amplification efficiency significantly. Conclusion The blind use of a <b>random</b> <b>primer</b> with attached universal tag (random-tagged primer) in a PCR reaction on a pathogen sample may not lead to a successful amplification. Thus, the design of random-tagged primers is an important consideration when performing PCR. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{chromosome}} walking method was improved in this work. The new method was named as nonspecific primer anchored PCR (NPA-PCR). Nested gene specific primers were designed {{based on the}} known region and long <b>random</b> <b>primer</b> using degeneracy oligonucleotides for nonspecific anchoring.

40|$|Analogous to metagenomics, {{environmental}} transcriptomics (metatranscriptomics) retrieves and sequences environmental mRNAs from a microbial assemblage {{without prior}} knowledge of what genes the community might be expressing. Thus it provides the most unbiased perspective on community gene expression in situ. Environmental transcriptomics protocols are technically difficult since prokaryotic mRNAs generally lack the poly(A) tails that make isolation of eukaryotic messages relatively straightforward 1 {{and because of the}} relatively short half lives of mRNAs 2. In addition, mRNAs are much less abundant than rRNAs in total RNA extracts, thus an rRNA background often overwhelms mRNA signals. However, techniques for overcoming some of these difficulties have recently been developed. A procedure for analyzing environmental transcriptomes by creating clone libraries using <b>random</b> <b>primers</b> to reverse-transcribe and amplify environmental mRNAs was recently described was successful in two different natural environments, but results were biased by selection of the <b>random</b> <b>primers</b> used to initiate cDNA synthesis 3.

40|$|The use {{of single}} <b>random</b> <b>primers,</b> {{selected}} {{in the absence of}} target sequence information, {{has been shown to be}} effective in producing DNA amplifications that provide fingerprints which are unique to individual organisms. DNA amplification by random priming was applied to the DNA from isolates of Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar trifolii. Amplification products were produced using a number of primers, and the resulting fingerprints allowed strain differentiation. However, the effectiveness of primers was dependent upon length and GC content. It was also possible to amplify DNA directly from cells in culture and in nodule tissue.
