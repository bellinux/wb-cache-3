40|$|Ducks nesting on {{seasonal}} and semi-permanent wetlands near Flagstaff, Arizona {{were studied}} during 1978, 1979, and 1980 to determine factors limiting {{the production of}} waterfowl. The breeding population was comprised of 12 species of ducks. Pintails (Anas acuta), cinnamon teal (A. cyanoptera), redheads (Aythya americana), and <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> (Oxyura jamaicensis) made up 72 % of the breeding population. Redheads and <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> were essentially limited to nesting in dense stands of hardstem bulrush (Scirpus acutus) found only in semi-permanent wetlands. Reproductive success (broods/pair) of redheads and <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> was limited by high nest abandonment. Pintails and cinnamon teal indicated a strong preference for seasonal wetlands. Reproductive success of both species was greater on seasonal wetlands. Cinnamon teal success was limited by intense nest depradation by crows (Corvus brachyrhyncos) and ravens (C. corax). The quality of upland nesting cover was reduced by cattle and may have facilitated corvid predation...|$|R

40|$|I {{studied the}} {{foraging}} behavior of <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> (Oxyura jamaicensis) feeding on patchily distributed prey {{in a large}} (5 -m long, 2 -m wide, and up to 2 -m deep) aquarium. The substrate consisted of a 4 x 4 array of wooden trays (1. 0 -m long, 0. 5 -m wide, and 0. 1 -m deep) which contained 6 cm of sand. Any tray could {{be removed from the}} aquarium and “loaded” with a known number of prey. One bird foraged in the aquarium at a time; thus, by removing a food tray after a trial ended and counting the remaining prey, I calculated the number of prey consumed by the bird. I designed several experiments to determine if <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> abandoned a food patch {{in a manner consistent with}} the predictions of a simple, deterministic, patch depletion model. This model is based on the premise that a predator should maximize its rate of net energy intake while foraging. To accomplish this, a predator should only remain in a food patch as long as its rate of energy intake from that patch exceeds the average rate of intake from the environment. In the majority of comparisons, the number of food items consumed by the <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> in these experiments was consistent with the predictions of the foraging model. When the birds did not forage as predicted by the model, they stayed in the patch longer and consumed more prey than predicted by the model. An examination of the relation between rate of net energy intake and time spent foraging in the food patch indicated that by staying in a patch longer than predicted, the <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> experienced only a small deviation from maximum rate of net energy intake. These results provided quantitative support for the prediction that <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> maximize their rate of net energy intake while foraging...|$|R

25|$|Since 1600, five {{species of}} ducks have become extinct {{due to the}} {{activities}} of humans, and subfossil remains have shown that humans caused numerous extinctions in prehistory. Today, many more are considered threatened. Most of the historic and prehistoric extinctions were insular species, vulnerable due to small populations (often endemic to a single island), and island tameness. Evolving on islands that lacked predators, these species lost antipredator behaviours, {{as well as the}} ability to fly, and were vulnerable to human hunting pressure and introduced species. Other extinctions and declines are attributable to overhunting, habitat loss and modification, and hybridisation with introduced ducks (for example the introduced <b>ruddy</b> <b>duck</b> swamping the white-headed duck in Europe). Numerous governments and conservation and hunting organisations have made considerable progress in protecting ducks and duck populations through habitat protection and creation, laws and protection, and captive-breeding programmes.|$|E

500|$|With a {{telephone}} {{in every room}} and first-class room service, the hotel was designed specifically to cater {{to the needs of}} socially prominent [...] "wealthy upper crust" [...] of New York and distinguished foreign visitors to the city. The hotel became, according to author Sean Dennis Cashman, [...] "a successful symbol of the opulence and achievement of the Astor family". It was the first hotel to offer complete electricity and private bathrooms. Founding proprietor Boldt, whose motto was [...] "the guest is always right", became wealthy and prominent internationally, if not so much a popular celebrity as his famous employee, Oscar Tschirky, known as [...] "Oscar of the Waldorf", maître d'hôtel from the hotel's inauguration in 1893 until his retirement in 1943. Tschirky had arrived in the United States from Switzerland ten years prior to applying for the position at the new Waldorf and over the years grew to possess a great knowledge of cuisine. He authored The Cookbook by Oscar of The Waldorf (1896), a 900-page book featuring all of the popular recipes of the day, including his own, for which he garnered great acclaim, such as Waldorf salad, Eggs Benedict and Thousand Island dressing, which remain popular worldwide today. James Remington McCarthy wrote in his book Peacock Alley that Oscar gained renown among the general public as an artist who [...] "composed sonatas in soups, symphonies in salads, minuets in sauces, lyrics in entrees". In 1902 Tschirky published Serving a Course Dinner by Oscar of the Waldorf-Astoria, a booklet that explains the intricacies of being a caterer to the American and international elite. Tschirky had an excellent memory and an encyclopedic memory of the culinary preferences of many of the guests, which further added to his popularity. In 1937, for instance, he recalled the opening night and notable people present at the old Waldorf, a guest at the old building known to the public as Buffalo Bill, and spoke at length about the planning for the Panama Canal that took place at the Waldorf-Astoria.The Waldorf gained significant renown internationally for its fundraising dinners and balls, regularly attracting notables of the day such as Andrew Carnegie, who became a fixture. Banquets were often held in the ballroom for esteemed figures and international royalty. The Waldorf Astoria was influential in advancing the status of women, who were admitted singly without escorts. George Boldt's wife, Louise Kehrer Boldt, was influential in evolving the idea of the grand urban hotel as a social center, particularly in making it appealing to women as a venue for social events. On February 11, 1899, Oscar hosted a lavish dinner reception that the New York Herald Tribune cited as the city's costliest dinner at the time.

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 I {{evaluated}} {{the use of}} various wetlands by wintering ducks in the Tulare Lake Basin (TLB), California, during October 1982 - April 1983 and September 1983 - March 1984. Aerial waterfowl counts of the TLB were used to document spacial use patterns by ducks. Ground surveys on evaporation ponds in the Tulare Lake Drainage District (TLDD) were used to evaluate duck use of specific ponds with varying chemical and biological parameters. During mid-winter, up to 300, 000 ducks used the TLB. The most abundant species (northern pintail (Anas acuta), northern shoveler (Anas clvoeata), and green-winged teal (Anas crecca)) were found on freshwater habitats. <b>Ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> (Oxvura jamaicensis) were the only species to extensively use the evaporation ponds.

40|$|In many taxa, females {{lay eggs}} in the nests of other conspecifics. To {{determine}} {{the conditions under which}} conspecific brood parasitism develops, it is necessary to identify parasitic offspring and the females who produce them; however, for most systems parasitism can be difficult to observe and most genetic approaches have relatively low resolving power. In this study, we used protein fingerprinting from egg albumen and 10 microsatellite loci to genetically match parasitic ducklings to their mothers in a population of <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> (Oxyura jamaicensis). We found that 67 % of nests contained parasitic offspring, and we successfully identified their mothers in 61 % of the cases. Of the parasitic females identified, 77 % also had nests of their own (i. e. a dual tactic, where females both nest and lay parasitically), and we found no evidence that parasitic females pursued a specialist (parasitism only) tactic. We also found that parasitic egg laying was not influenced by nest loss, predation or female condition. Thus, in contrast to most waterfowl studied to date, female <b>ruddy</b> <b>ducks</b> appear to lay parasitic eggs whenever the opportunity arises. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} gut {{contents}} of 17 White-headed Ducks, 25 North American <b>Ruddy</b> <b>Ducks</b> and 26 hybrids {{between the two}} species collected from 14 Spanish wetlands. This is the most detailed study to date of Oxyura diet in the Palearctic region. Food items from at least 27 families of invertebrates and at least ten families of aquatic plants were identified. The method of collection of ducks and rapid digestion of soft-bodied invertebrates may have overestimated the importance of plant matter. However, animal foods were more important, constituting 73 % of aggregate volume of gullet contents. In both duck species and their hybrids, benthic chironomid larvae and pupae {{were the most important}} food item, present in 69 % of gullets and 75 % of gizzards, and constituting 35 % of aggregate volume and 26 % of aggregate percentage in gullets. Angiosperm seeds were the next most important dietary component, and crustaceans (mainly Amphipoda, Cladocera and Isopoda) and green plant material were of secondary importance. No significant differences in diet were detected between duck species, sex or age classes. Birds sampled in the breeding season had more nematodes, but these may have been parasitic. Chironomids were less abundant in <b>Ruddy</b> <b>Ducks</b> collected from northern Spain outside of the range of the White-headed Duck. Peer reviewe...|$|R
