40|$|What role do general-purpose, experience-sensitive perceptual {{mechanisms}} play {{in producing}} characteristic features of face perception? We previously demonstrated that different-colored, misaligned framing backgrounds, designed to disrupt perceptual grouping of face parts appearing upon them, disrupt holistic face perception. In the current experiments, a similar part-judgment task with composite faces was performed: face parts appeared in either misaligned, different-colored rectangles or aligned, same-colored rectangles. To investigate whether experience can shape impacts of perceptual grouping on holistic face perception, a pre-task fostered {{the perception of}} either (a) the misaligned, differently colored <b>rectangle</b> <b>frames</b> as parts of a single, multicolored polygon or (b) the aligned, same-colored <b>rectangle</b> <b>frames</b> as a single square shape. Faces appearing in the misaligned, differently colored rectangles were processed more holistically by those in the polygon-, compared with the square-, pre-task group. Holistic effects for faces appearing in aligned, same-colored rectangles showed the opposite pattern. Experiment 2, which included a pre-task condition fostering {{the perception of the}} aligned, same-colored frames as pairs of independent rectangles, provided converging evidence that experience can modulate impacts of perceptual grouping on holistic face perception. These results are surprising given the proposed impenetrability of holistic face perception and provide insights into the elusive mechanisms underlying holistic perception. 13 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Current {{approaches}} for opening door usually {{focus on the}} recognition of door handle in a fixed position, {{but in the process}} of door opening, a manipulator with a mobile platform is very important under real-world scenarios, which brings significance to the location and distance measurement of a door handle when the mobile platform is moving. In this paper, a method for location of a door handle in HSI color space is presented. The image of the door handle is captured by the kinect for Xbox 360, and is processed in HSI color space, resulting in a <b>rectangle</b> <b>frame</b> fitted to the door handle to be displayed in real time. The distance value of the door handle is obtained from the depth image. Experiment results show the efficiency of the proposed method...|$|E

A characteristic of method about this education is that has various evaluation items. One of important items about “Composition Lesson” is balance on a ratio of area on “Figure and Ground”. It has re-ported that apparent sizes of geometric shape are changed by influenced of its angle. However, apparent sizes of geometric shape in a frame have not been investigated until now. Therefore, we conducted a psychological experiment on the effect of figure angle changes to apparent sizes of figure arranged {{in the center of a}} <b>rectangle</b> <b>frame.</b> We used paried comperation and magunitude estimation.

In addition the present study explores the extend of children’s knowledge of various materials, used in framework construction, and their conclusions of possible geometric forms, made by various materials in framework construction. 4 and 5 year old children were involved in present study by answering the questions {{before and after the}} framework construction activities. 4 and 5 year old children understand the frame concept and can identify at least 5 types of different materials possibly used in framework construction. They favor <b>rectangle</b> <b>frame</b> shape more than round or triangular and mouldable materials more than unmouldable. Accordingly to children, all geometric shapes (rectangular, round and triangular) can be made from all the materials offered (clay, wood, plastics). Preschool children understand and recognize the concept of framework in three geometric forms with materials, available in kindergarten. ...|$|E

According to the investigations results {{it has been}} made the table that contains information about building address, its former destination and the date of construction, features of majolica location and its description. The treatment of investigation materials gave author the possibility to work out majolica types and analyze their composition and stylistic. Usually majolica has been combined with brick and stucco architectural decoration of the neo–styles {{of the end of}} the 19 th century. Majolica assortment has been collected from monolith elements (stars, roses, coat of arms and medallions) and square tiles. The last ones have been divided into two groups. The ornaments “bandelwerk” and arabesque have been collected from the first tiles group. The second tiles group have got closed composition, in the centre of which the palmetto or trefoil regularly have been located. Sometimes tiles have been decorated with concentric circles, rustic imitation or rose’s variety. Panels, <b>rectangle</b> <b>frames,</b> friezes, eight–pointed stars and rhombic compositions have been made up from ceramic tiles. Frequently single tiles and compositions from them have been decorated by brick frame. Besides several exceptions majolica of the “picturesque” style is relief that caused the surface pollution and coloristic distortion. The cleaning by author of several tiles made possible to detect authentic colors: orange, blue, green and brown against white background. Besides of the surface pollution another actual problem is majolica cracking and upper layer exfoliation caused by frosting and melting processes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Two studies {{examine the}} effect of the {{geometric}} forms of nodes of a concept map, presented prior to reading a text, on its comprehension. In the first study we varied the map interface. 162 students received a concept map to study. The map was presented in one of five interfaces: two bi-form interfaces (ellipses for content and rectangles for structure concepts, and vice versa), two uniform interfaces (ellipses or <b>rectangles</b> node <b>frames),</b> or a concept map without frames. Then a text was given to study without the map, and a comprehension test followed. Three texts were studied. The results indicated no comprehension differences between the two bi-form groups and neither between the two uniform groups. The comprehension scores were higher for the bi-form compared with the uniform interface. The no frame interface received the lowest scores. Before and after studying the texts, the students ranked their preferences for the various map interfaces. The preferences were in concordance to the overall comprehension results, regardless to the group conditions. In the second study we also compared an incongruent biform map to the other conditions using the same procedure. Incongruence hindered comprehension and was least preferred. ...|$|R

5000|$|While {{the work}} of the 1950s and ‘60s {{referred}} to large issues of contemporary culture and existential anxiety, Kerslake’s works of the 1970s began to take on a more personal tone. Color and the use of photomechanical reproduction also take precedence in the prints of that decade. Kerslake credited his colleague Todd Walker, a professor in photography and printmaking at the University of Florida, with awakening his interest in the use of photo processes in printmaking. [...] In “The Magic House of the Heart's Desire” Kerslake combined images of a historic mansion located in his hometown of Mt. Vernon; twin images of his wife and children (located in rondels below the central image) and an all-seeing (protective) eye that hovers above all. The imagery conveys nostalgia, familial responsibilities in the present and a desire to secure the future. The artist’s feeling for the language of longing culminates in his “Cecelia: The Artist’s Mother as a Young Woman” created in the year following his mother’s death. The print features a photo-etching of a smiling girl standing on a rocky plain as seagulls wheel overhead. According to Larry D. Perkins, former curator of collections at the Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art in Gainesville, Florida,the birds refer to the “the transcendence of the spirit, while the receding <b>rectangles</b> that <b>frame</b> the portrait may suggest the passing of time or alternate states of existence.” ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the design and}} implementation of user controlled smooth zooming of a starfield display. A starfield display is a two dimensional graphical visualization of a multidimensional database where every item from the database is represented as a small colored rectangle whose position is determined by its ranking along ordinal attributes of the items {{laid out on the}} axes. One way of navigating this visual information is by using a zooming tool to incrementally zoom in on the items by varying the attribute range on either axis independently - such zooming causes the rectangles to move continuously and to grow or shrink. To get a feeling of flying through the data, users should be able to track the motion of each rectangle without getting distracted by flicker or large jumps - conditions that necessitate high display refresh rates and closely spaced <b>rectangles</b> on successive <b>frames.</b> Although the use of high-speed hardware can achieve the required visual effect for small databases, the twin software bottlenecks of rapidly accessing display items and constructing a new display image fundamentally retard the refresh rate. Our work explores several methods to overcome these bottlenecks, presents a taxonomy of various zooming methods and introduces a new widget, the zoom bar, that facilitates zooming. <P...|$|R
40|$|Light {{curves of}} pulses of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) {{affected}} by the Doppler effect of fireballs are investigated. Formulas of the count rate {{in terms of the}} integral of time are presented. Applying a rest frame δ function form of pulses we obtain the light curve of pulses, ignoring the effect of the rest frame pulse width, for expanding fireballs. From the light curve we find that the time scale of a pulse would be significantly {{affected by the}} Lorentz factor. If the Lorentz factor Γ is very large, the observed width of the light curve of a very narrow pulse would become much smaller than the time scale of the real size of the fireball, following the law of Γ ^- 2. This explains why for many sources very short time scale of pulses is observed. In addition, light curves of rest <b>frame</b> <b>rectangle</b> pulses as well as other forms of rest frame pulses which last an interval of time are also studied. These light curves reveal the well known structure of a fast rise and an exponential decay (FRED) observed in many GRBs. We find that, the character of FRED is a consequence of the expanding motion of fireballs. The main difference of the observed profiles of pulses is due to their rest frame widths. The interval between the beginning and the peak of pulses depends not only on the Lorentz factor but also on the width of the rest frame pulse as well...|$|R
