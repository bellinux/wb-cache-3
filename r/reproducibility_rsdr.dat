40|$|A {{collaborative}} study, International Evaluation Measurement Programme®- 25 a, {{was conducted}} in accordance with international protocols to determine the performance characteristics of an analytical method for the determination of dissolved bromate in drinking water. The method should fulfill the analytical requirements of Council Directive 98 / 83 /EC (referred to in this work as the Drinking Water Directive; DWD). The new draft standard method under investigation is based on ion chromatography followed by post-column reaction and UV detection. The collaborating laboratories used the Draft International Organization for Standardization (ISO) /Draft International Standard (DIS) 11206 document. The existing standard method (ISO 15061 : 2001) is based on ion chromatography using suppressed conductivity detection, in which a preconcentration step may be required for the determination of bromate concentrations as low as 3 to 5 μg/L. The new method includes a dilution step that reduces the matrix effects, thus allowing the determination of bromate concentrations down to 0. 5 μg/L. Furthermore, the method aims to minimize any potential interference of chlorite ions. The collaborative study investigated different types of drinking water, such as soft, hard, and mineral water. Other types of water, such as raw water (untreated), swimming pool water, a blank (named river water), and a bromate standard solution, were included as test samples. All test matrixes except the swimming pool water were spiked with high-purity potassium bromate to obtain bromate concentrations ranging from 1. 67 to 10. 0 μg/L. Swimming pool water was not spiked, as this water was incurred with bromate. Test samples were dispatched to 17 laboratories from nine different countries. Sixteen participants reported results. The repeatability RSD (RSDr) ranged from 1. 2 to 4. 1 %, while the <b>reproducibility</b> RSD (<b>RSDR)</b> ranged from 2. 3 to 5. 9 %.

40|$|An inter-laboratory {{comparison}} {{study was}} carried out {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of a method that was standardised for the determination of acrylamide in bakery and potato products for the determination of acrylamide in roasted coffee. The intention was to extend the scope of the standardised method to roasted coffee. Therefore only slight modifications of the standardised method were tolerated. The method is based on aqueous extraction of the roasted coffee matrix and solid phase extraction (SPE) clean-up followed by isotope dilution high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS/MS). The test portion of the sample was spiked with isotope labelled acrylamide and extracted on a mechanical shaker with n-hexane and water for one hour. The sample extract was centrifuged, the organic phase was discarded, and a portion of the aqueous extract was further cleaned-up by solid phase extraction on Isolute Multimode followed by Isolute ENV+ columns. The acrylamide-containing fraction eluted from the second SPE column was evaporated to about 500 µL and analysed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Three coffee samples and one aqueous acrylamide standard solution (quality control sample) were sent to 11 laboratories from 8 EU Member States. All samples were sent as blinded duplicates. Based on the reported results the relative standard deviations for <b>reproducibility</b> (<b>RSDR)</b> were 11. 5 % at an acrylamide level of 160 µg/kg, 10. 1 % at a level of 263 µg/kg, and 9. 6 % at a level of 585 µg/kg.

The method was tested for the determination of ochratoxin A (OTA) in animal feed at concentration levels relevant to those proposed according to Commission Recommendation 2006 / 576 /EC (). The test portion of the sample was extracted with methanol:water. The sample extract was filtered, diluted, passed over an immunoaffinity column for clean-up and then eluted with methanol. The separation and determination of the OTA was performed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection with an excitation of 333 nm and emission of 467 nm. The animal feed samples, both spiked and naturally contaminated with OTA, were sent to 35 laboratories in 15 EU Member States, Colombia, Canada and Japan. Each laboratory received 6 duplicate samples ¿ 4 coded and 2 blanks for spiking with coded solutions. Blank marked test portions of the samples were spiked at levels of 76 µg/kg and 305 µg/kg OTA. The range of recovery values reported spanned from 47 % ¿ 124 % with an average value of 82 % and 79 % for each level respectively.

40|$|The {{performance}} {{characteristics of a}} method based on HPLC with postcolumn derivatization and spectrophotometric detection for the quantification of semduramicin in poultry feedingstuffs have been determined via a collaborative study. Semduramicin is a feed additive that is authorized for fattening chickens within the European Union at a minimum and maximum content of 20 and 25 mg/kg in feedingstuffs, respectively. The target concentration of semduramicin in the test samples ranged from 11. 5 to 45. 0 mg/kg. The study has been conducted with {{two different types of}} test material, namely, feedingstuff samples that have been previously ground in our laboratory and pelleted feedingstuffs. In the latter case, the laboratories participating in the study had to grind the samples prior to analysis. The obtained RSD for repeatability (RSDr) ranged from 2 to 10 % for the ground materials, and from 2 and 7 % for the pelleted materials. The RSD for <b>reproducibility</b> (<b>RSDR)</b> varied between 11 and 16 % for the ground materials, and between 12 and 15 % for the pelleted materials. These data indicated that grinding as an additional step in the analytical procedure did not influence the precision profile of the method. In addition, the HorRat values for all test materials were below or equal to 1. 5, thus demonstrating that the obtained precision data were acceptable for the purpose of the method. Furthermore, an estimation of trueness based on statistical treatment of the results reported from the laboratories for spiked samples revealed acceptable mean recovery values of 88 ± 4 %.

A test portion is extracted with a mixture of methanol and aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution. The extract is filtered, diluted with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and OTA is purified with an immunoaffinity column containing antibodies specific to OTA. The purified extract is dried, reconstituted and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography-flourimetric detection. Twenty laboratories from 13 EU Member States, a laboratory in Uruguay, one in Turkey, one in Canada, and one in US participated in this study. Contents of OTA ranged from 26 to 141 µg/kg and from 8 to 52 µg/kg for liquorice extracts and root material respectively. Mean recoveries were calculated as 87 % for liquorice root, and 84 to 88 % for liquorice extracts. Based on results for the spiked and naturally contaminated samples the relative standard deviations for <b>reproducibility</b> (<b>RSDR)</b> ranged from 10 to 17 % and from 11 to 22 % in liquorice extracts and liquorice root respectively.

40|$|A {{collaborative}} trial, {{was conducted}} in accordance with international protocols to determine the performance characteristics of an analytical method for the quantification of inorganic arsenic (iAs) in food. The method is based on (i) solubilisation of the protein matrix with concentrated hydrochloric acid to denature proteins and allow the release of all arsenic species into solution, and (ii) the subsequent extraction of the inorganic arsenic present in the acid medium using chloroform followed by back-extraction to acid medium. The final detection and quantification is done by flow injection hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry (FI-HG-AAS). Thirteen laboratories, from nine EU countries, registered for participation. All were experienced {{in the analysis of}} inorganic arsenic in various food commodities using FI-HG-AAS. The seven test items used in this exercise were all reference materials (either certified reference materials or test items of former IMEP proficiency tests) covering a broad range of matrices and concentrations: mussels tissue (EC-JRC-IRMM, ERM-CE 278 k), cabbage (IAEA, IAEA- 359), seaweed (Hijiki) (NMIJ, CRM 7405 a), fish protein (NRC, DORM- 4), rice (EC-JRC-IRMM, IMEP- 107), wheat (EC-JRC-IRMM, IMEP- 112), mushrooms (EC-JRC-IRMM, IMEP- 116) and finally rice (EC-JRC-IRMM, ERM-BC 211), which was used as pre-test item for training purposes. The mass fraction of iAs was not known for all the test items used, for this reason five laboratories with recognised experience in the analysis of iAs were asked to analyse the test items using a method of their choice, different from the one being validated, in order to compare with the FI-HG-AAS method. The relative standard deviation for repeatability of the validated method (RSDr) ranged from 4. 1 to 10. 3 %, while the relative standard deviation for <b>reproducibility</b> (<b>RSDR)</b> ranged from 6. 1 to 22. 8 %.

The method is based on immunoaffinity column cleanup followed by high-performance liquid chromatography using fluorimetry (HPLC-Fl). The test portion of the sample is extracted with methanol¿water (75 + 25, v/v). The sample extract is filtered, diluted, and passed over an immunoaffinity column. ZON is eluted with methanol. The separation and determination of ZON is performed by reversed-phase HPLC-Fl with an excitation wavelength of 274 nm and an emission wavelength of 446 nm. Test portions of the samples were spiked at levels of 20 and 30 µg/kg ZON in baby food and at levels of 100 and 150 µg/kg ZON in animal feed. Mean recoveries from each participant ranged from 78 to 119 % with an average value of 92 % for baby food and from 51 to 122 % with an average value of 74 % for animal feed. Based on results for spiked samples (blind duplicates at 2 levels), as well as naturally contaminated samples (blind duplicates at 3 levels), the relative standard deviation for repeatability (RSDr) in baby food ranged from 2. 8 to 9. 0 %.

The test portion of the sample was extracted with methanol:water. The sample extract was filtered, diluted, passed over an immunoaffinity column for clean-up and evaporated. The redissolved and purified eluate was separated and determined by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and fluorescence detection after the fumonisins had been derivatised to their fluorescent isoindols in the presence of o-phthaldehyde and a thiol-coupling reagent with either pre- or post-column derivatisation. Baby food, breakfast cereal and animal feed samples, both blank and naturally contaminated with FB 1 and FB 2, were sent to 40 laboratories from 19 EU Member States, and a laboratory in Uruguay. For recovery determination extra test portions of the blank samples were to be spiked by the participants at levels of 135 µg/kg for the sum of FB 1 and FB 2 in baby food, 400 µg/kg in breakfast cereals, and 3700 µg/kg in animal feed. All samples were sent as blinded duplicates. Mean recoveries were calculated as 71 % for baby food, and 87 % for breakfast cereals. Based on results for the spiked and naturally contaminated samples the relative standard deviations for <b>reproducibility</b> (<b>RSDR)</b> in baby food were 31 % at a spiked level of 135 µg/kg, 44 % at a natural contamination level of 267 µg/kg, and 33 % at a natural contamination level of 501 µg/kg.

The method validation study was conducted according to the International Union for Pure and Applied Chemistry harmonised protocol. The method was used for the determination of altenuene, alternariol, alternariol monomethyl ether, tentoxin and tenuazonic acid in both naturally contaminated and fortified samples. It was based on the extraction of the test materials with an acidified methanol – water mixture, followed by solid phase extraction clean-up. The determination was carried out by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometric detector. The trial involved 16 participants representing a cross section of research, private and official control laboratories from 11 EU Member States and Canada. The selection of collaborators was based on the performance in the pre-trial that was organised prior to the collaborative trial with participation of 25 laboratories. Mean recoveries reported ranged from 53 % to 107 %. The sample reconstitution in a water-based injection solution is thought to be responsible for the low recovery obtained for alternariol monomethyl ether, which is the least polar compound from the toxins of interest. The relative standard deviation for repeatability (RSDr) ranged from 2. 0 to 34. 8 %. The relative standard deviation for <b>reproducibility</b> (<b>RSDR)</b> ranged from 7. 7 to 49. 6 %, reflecting HorRat values from 0. 5 to 2. 4 according to the Horwitz function modified by Thompson. A correction for recovery with the data generated by spiking experiments partially improve the reproducibility performance of the method. The results highlight that the performance characteristics strongly depend on the matrix analysed, despite that fact that matrix matched calibration was used. These matrix effects can be compensated using stable isotope labelled internal standards; however, stable isotope analogues for the analysed compounds are not commercially available so far. The outcome of this study however underpins its fitness-for-purpose, which is a requirement for its formal standardisation by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN). JRC.

40|$|An inter-laboratory {{comparison}} {{was carried}} out to evaluate the performance characteristics of a method for the determination of sucralose in beverages, which was developed at the JRC-IRMM. The method is based on high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC), and reagent-free derivatisation followed by ultraviolet/fluorescence detection. It was tested for the determination of Sucralose (C 12 H 19 Cl 3 O 8; (2 R, 3 R, 4 R, 5 S, 6 R) - 2 -[(2 R, 3 S, 4 S, 5 S) - 2, 5 -bis(chloromethyl) - 3, 4 -dihydroxy-oxolan- 2 -yl]oxy- 5 -chloro- 6 -hydroxymethyl) oxane- 3, 4 -diol; CAS No: 56038 - 13 - 2) in carbonated and still alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages at proposed European regulatory limits according to Directive 2003 / 115 /EC (). Precise determination of Sucralose levels {{in some of the}} matrices for which European legislative limits apply, required a robust and reliable analytical method. HPTLC employing reagent-free derivatisation offered such a reliable but simple, fast, cost-effective and environment friendly method (very limited quantities of organic solvents methanol and acetonitrile were used). Separation of Sucralose was performed by direct application of samples (diluted, degassed and/or filtered, if necessary) on amino-bonded silica gel HPTLC plates without prior cleanup and development with acetonitrile:water. The sweetener was determined after heating of the developed plate to 190 °C and quantified both in ultraviolet absorption and fluorescence measurement mode. Beverages spiked with sucralose as well as beverages taken from the market and labelled to contain sucralose, were sent to 14 laboratories in five different countries following IUPAC guidelines. A sample that did not contain measureable amounts of sucralose was spiked at levels of 30. 5 mg/L, 100. 7 mg/L and 299 mg/L. Recoveries ranged from 104 ¿ 125 % with an average of 112 % for ultraviolet detection and from 98 ¿ 101 % with an average of 100 % for fluorescent detection. Based on results for spiked samples (blind duplicates at three levels), as well as samples containing Sucralose (blind duplicates at three levels and one split level), the relative standard deviation for repeatability (RSDr) ranged from 10 ¿ 31 % for ultraviolet detection and from 9 ¿ 16 % for fluorescence detection. The relative standard deviation for <b>reproducibility</b> (<b>RSDR)</b> ranged from 14 ¿ 31 % for ultraviolet detection and from 9 ¿ 21 % for fluorescence detection. The limit of quantification on the basis of 10 x the baseline noise was 6 mg/L and response was linear in the range between 30 ¿ 150 ng/spot. The method is therefore considered suitable for the determination of Sucralose in beverages at the proposed European legislative limits. JRC. D. 8 -Food safety and qualit...|$|E
