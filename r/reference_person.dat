40|$|Hospitalization rates {{over time}} of {{childhood}} cancer survivors (CCS) {{provide insight into}} the burden of unfavorable health conditions on CCS and health care resources. The objective of our study was to examine trends in hospitalizations of CCS and risk factors in comparison with the general population. We performed a medical record linkage study of a cohort of 1564 ≥five-year CCS with national registers. We obtained a random sample of the general population matched on year of birth, gender and calendar year per CCS retrieved. We quantified and compared hospitalization rates of CCS and <b>reference</b> <b>persons</b> from 1995 until 2005, and we analyzed risk factors for hospitalization within the CCS cohort with multivariable Poisson models. We retrieved hospitalization information from 1382 CCS and 25583 <b>reference</b> <b>persons.</b> The overall relative hospitalization rate (RHR) was 2. 2 (95 %CI: 1. 9 - 2. 5) for CCS compared to <b>reference</b> <b>persons.</b> CCS with central nervous system and solid tumors had highest RHRs. Hospitalization rates in CCS were increased compared to <b>reference</b> <b>persons</b> up to at least 30 years after primary diagnosis, with highest rates 5 - 10 and 20 - 30 years after primary cancer. RHRs were highest for hospitalizations due to neoplasms (10. 7; 95 %CI: 7. 1 - 16. 3) and endocrine/nutritional/metabolic disorders (7. 3; 95 %CI: 4. 6 - 11. 7). Female gender (P < 0. 001), radiotherapy to head and/or neck (P < 0. 001) or thorax and/or abdomen (P = 0. 03) and surgery (P = 0. 01) were associated with higher hospitalization rates in CCS. In conclusion, CCS have increased hospitalization rates compared to the general population, up to at least 30 years after primary cancer treatment. These findings imply a high and long-term burden of unfavorable health conditions after childhood cancer on survivors and health care resource...|$|R

Patients with cirrhosis have chronic systemic inflammation and therefore we examined the association between cirrhosis and primary osteoarthritis of the hip and knee. In Danish healthcare databases we identified all residents over 60 years diagnosed with cirrhosis in 1994 - 2011, and {{for each of them}} we sampled five age- and gender-matched <b>reference</b> <b>persons</b> from the general population. We excluded everyone with risk factors for secondary osteoarthritis and computed incidence rates of primary osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. We used stratified Cox regression to estimate the hazard ratios of primary osteoarthritis for cirrhosis patients vs. <b>reference</b> <b>persons</b> in strata defined by gender, age, cirrhosis etiology, and ascites vs. no ascites. We also computed separate HRs for primary osteoarthritis of the hips or knees. We identified 10, 049 cirrhosis patients. Their median age was 67 years, and 65 % were men. Among the cirrhosis patients the crude incidence rate of primary osteoarthritis was 8. 40 (95 % CI: 7. 30 - 9. 63) per 1000 person-years. The rate was similar in the reference persons: 8. 76 (95 % CI: 8. 43 - 9. 12) per 1000 person-years. Accordingly, the hazard ratio for primary osteoarthritis for cirrhosis patients vs. <b>reference</b> <b>persons</b> was 0. 99 (95 % CI: 0. 85 - 1. 16), and we found the same null association in all patient strata and in both joints.

50|$|These {{data from}} the Consumer Expenditure Survey are used {{in a number of}} {{different}} ways by a variety of users. One important use of the survey is for the periodic revision of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index (CPI). The Bureau uses survey results to select new market baskets of goods and services for the CPI every two years, to determine the relative importance of CPI components, and to derive new cost weights for the market baskets. Working with the U.S. Census Bureau, Consumer Expenditure Survey data are used to calculate thresholds for the Supplemental Poverty Measure. The US Department of Agriculture uses Consumer Expenditure information in estimating the cost of raising children. Market researchers find the data useful in analyzing the demand for groups of goods and services. The data allow them to track spending trends of different types of consumer units. Government and private agencies use the data to study the welfare of particular segments of the population, such as those consumer units with a <b>reference</b> <b>person</b> aged 65 and older or under age 25, or for low-income consumer units. Economic policymakers use the data to study the impact of policy changes on the welfare of different socioeconomic groups. Researchers use the data in a variety of studies, including those that focus on the spending behavior of different family types, trends in expenditures on various expenditure components including new types of goods and services, gift-giving behavior, consumption studies, and historical spending trends.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} research, specifically, is {{to compare}} and {{contrast}} the different usages of third <b>person</b> <b>references</b> applied in the Chinese ST and in its two English TTs.

The sources which contain the third <b>person</b> <b>reference</b> found {{in the first three}} chapters of these three books were collected from both the original SL text of Hong Lou Meng in Chinese ST and the two translated TTs in English. One hundred and ninety-eight sentences including third <b>person</b> <b>reference</b> from the first three chapters of each book were extracted and coded to ease analysis. Halliday and Hasan’s (1976) taxonomy of third <b>person</b> <b>reference</b> was used to identify the different categories of third <b>person</b> <b>reference.</b> Besides, the different ways of translating third <b>person</b> <b>references</b> employed in the two English versions were also further explored according to Reiss and Vermeer’s (1984) Skopos theory. Findings of this study reveal that the numbers and types of third <b>person</b> <b>reference</b> found in the Hong Lou Meng and its two English translations are shown differently. Furthermore, this study also indicated that the two translators of Hong Lou Meng have different Skopos and translating style. The way of translating third <b>person</b> <b>references</b> in the two target contexts was construed differently based on their own translated version of Skopos as well as their Chinese or Western cultural influence.

40|$|The thesis investigates {{reference}} to non-present, singular persons in Swedish talk-ininteraction. The overall {{aim of the}} study is to analyse instances of <b>person</b> <b>reference</b> as parts of their linguistic, sequential and social contexts, and to describe these instances with regard to interactional, formal/structural, and functional aspects. An important point of departure for the study is that instances of <b>person</b> <b>reference</b> must be analysed as choices from different alternatives. This means that instances of <b>person</b> <b>reference</b> should neither be thought of as mere manifestations of the speaker’s own state of knowledge of the referent and her/his assessment of the addressee’s knowledge state, nor as reflections of structural aspects of the discourse. Theoretically and methodologically, the study belongs to the fields of interactional linguistics and conversation analysis (CA). The data for the study are drawn from naturally occurring everyday and institutional interaction and includes two-party and multi-party interaction, and telephone as well as face-to-face interaction. The analyses of introductory <b>references</b> to <b>persons</b> highlight issues such as the speaker’s claimed knowledge of/familiarity with the referent as well as the claims being made on behalf of the addressee, the role and importance of the referent in the activity of the talk, and the implications of <b>person</b> <b>reference</b> on the affiliation/disaffiliation of the participants with the referent, as well as with each other. The analyses of <b>references</b> to <b>persons</b> that have already been introduced in the interaction centres on partly different issues. The categorization of these references is based on two factors; the first being the sequential position of the reference and the second being whether the reference contributes to sequential continuity or discontinuity. The analyses emphasize that referential choice is an important resource for the construction of continuity and discontinuity, and that participants make use of these resources in unmarked as well as marked ways. This means that participants choose between different referential expressions, and these choices have different consequences depending on, inter alia, the sequential position of the reference. The study shows that <b>reference</b> to <b>persons</b> is doubly contextual: participants’ referential choices are made in consideration of the foregoing as well as the upcoming activity of the talk. Consequently, in order to adequately describe instances of <b>person</b> <b>reference,</b> the sequential context must be taken into account...|$|R

Locus of control is a psychological concept that captures individuals’ beliefs about the controllability of life events and is {{a key component of}} self-control. We find that households with an internal <b>reference</b> <b>person</b> save more both in terms of levels and as a percentage of their permanent incomes. Although the locus-of-control gap in savings rates is largest among rich households, the gap in wealth accumulation is particularly large for poor households. Finally, households with an internal <b>reference</b> <b>person</b> and average net worth hold significantly less financial wealth, but significantly more pension wealth, than otherwise similar households with an external <b>reference</b> <b>person...</b>|$|E
