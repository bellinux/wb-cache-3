Static and longitudinal methods are combined to test four conditions on time preferences: impatience, stationarity, age independence, and dynamic consistency. Decision making in groups should favor coordination via communication about voting intentions. We find that individuals are neither patient nor consistent, that groups are both patient and highly consistent, and that information exchange between participants helps groups converge to stable decisions. Finally we provide additional evidence showing that our results are driven by the specific <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>groups</b> and not by either repeated choices or individual preferences when choosing for other subjects...|$|E

With the {{increasing}} globalization of economy and consequent increasing in the inter and intra organizational competitiveness, the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>groups</b> in organizations and businesses achieve greater significance. The work, {{as well as}} the responsibility involved to reach a decision, is distributed among group members, which may be distributed geographically and may cooperate in an asynchronous way. This paper shortly presents the WebMeeting prototype, which is a group decision support system that supports ubiquitous group decision meetings. It is also discussed the influence of emotional factors in group decision making and it is proposed a multi-agent model to simulate ubiquitous group decision making processes, where argumentation and emotional capabilities are considered. ...|$|E
40|$|Psychologists (working with sociologists and {{political}} scientists) seem {{ready to go}} beyond piecemeal studies of economic behavior, or studies of economic behavior as merely incidents of general psychological theorems. They can formulate a new paradigm {{for the study of}} economic behavior. The unsatisfactory nature of the prevailing neo-classical paradigm has been well established. Economic behavior requires a distinct paradigm because rationalchoice behavior is a distinct subject. The new paradigm, the base for a new interdisciplinary field, referred to here as socioeconomics, must initially be highly parsimonious, without being excessively "underdetermined. " It must answer at least four key questions: How do people actually make choices when they aspire to act rationally? What is the role of emotions and values, next to intra-cognitive factors, in such decisions? What is the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>groups</b> in setting individual choices? And, {{what is the role of}} society? The answers may require collaboration of psychologists with other social scientists as well as the institutionalization of a new interstitial discipline. Psychologists have already made numerous significant contributions to the study of economic behavior. Important work has been conducted in the areas of consumer behavior research, industrial and organizational psychology, studies of productivity, general cognitive psychology (e. g., the study of individuals ' ability to draw inferences and render decisions rationally), and general social psychological work (e. g., the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>groups</b> within the work place). In addition, there are numerous specific studies on practically every facet of economic behavior, from compliance with the tax laws to predisposition to risk taking. (Fo...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we propose, implement, and {{evaluate}} GRM, a novel mobility model {{that accounts for}} the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>group</b> meeting dynamics and regularity in human mobility.

Next, we characterize the statistical properties <b>of</b> such <b>group</b> meetings in real mobility traces and design GRM accordingly. We show that GRM maintains the typical pairwise contact properties of real traces, such as contact duration and inter-contact time distributions. In addition, GRM accounts for the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>group</b> mobility, presenting group meetings regularity and social communities' structure. Finally, we evaluate state-of-art social-aware protocols for opportunistic routing using a synthetic contact trace generated by our model.

The exam of his comedies reveals how it’s not rare {{to find in}} Terence, {{in contrast to the}} ancient rhetorical treatises, six or seven actors together on the stage with parodic, structural or rhetoric effects. Sometimes the main actors are followed by not quantifiable groups of slaves, soldiers or, also, chorister and flautists, especially during the last scenes. Groups and people may also be evoked on the stage by the protagonist’s antinaturalistic acting. This feature, together with the metatheathrical role of the spectators that appears during the comedies’ prologues, is perhaps Terence’s main legacy to the European theatre of the following centuries...|$|E

One reason for the modest expansion of the theory is the underdevelopment {{of the concept of}} emotional energy. This paper examines emotional energy, related particularly to the dynamics of negative experiences. It asks whether or not negative emotions produce emotional energies that are qualitatively distinct from their positive counterparts. The analysis begins by tracing the development of Interaction Ritual Theory, and summarizes its core propositions. Next, it moves to a conceptualization of a “valenced” emotional energy and describes both “positive” and “negative” dimensions. Six propositions outline the central dynamics of negative emotional energy. The <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>groups</b> in the formation of positive and negative emotional energy are considered, as well as how these energies are significant sources of sociological motivation...|$|E
