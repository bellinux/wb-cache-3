40|$|Many {{next-generation}} e-science applications require {{fast and}} reliable transfer of {{large volumes of}} data, now frequently termed as "big data 2 ̆ 2, with guaranteed performance, which is typically enabled by the bandwidth reservation service in high-performance networks (HPNs). Users normally specify the properties and requirements of their data transfers in the bandwidth reservation requests (BRRs), and want to make bandwidth reservations on the HPNs {{to satisfy the requirements}} of their data transfers. The challenges of the bandwidth reservation arise from the requirements desired by both the users and the bandwidth <b>reservation</b> service <b>providers</b> of the HPNs. We focus on two important bandwidth reservation problems formulated from the combinations of the requirements from both users and the bandwidth <b>reservation</b> service <b>providers</b> of the HPNs: (i) Problem of scheduling all BRRs in one batch while achieving their best average data transfer earliest completion time and shortest duration, and (ii) Problem of scheduling two generic types of BRRs concerning data transfer reliability with different objectives and constraints in unreliable HPNs that are subject to node and link failures. We prove the two subproblems of the first problem are NP-complete problems, and fast and efficient heuristic algorithms are proposed. While the two subproblems of the second problem can be optimally solved in polynomial time. The corresponding optimal algorithms and proofs are given. We conduct extensive simulations to compare the performance of the proposed heuristic and optimal algorithms with naive scheduling algorithms and the algorithms currently used in production network in various performance metrics. The performance superiority of the proposed heuristic and optimal algorithms is verified...|$|R

40|$|Background: Emergency Contraception Pill (ECP) is an {{essential}} intervention to prevent unwanted pregnancies. However, its use has remained low due to various barriers including reservations among medical fraternity. Materials and Methods: This paper presents findings on barriers to ECP′s easy access for potential users from (i) a cross-sectional survey of providers′ attitudes, beliefs, and practices and interviews with key opinion leaders, (ii) three consultations organized by Population Council with policymakers and public health experts, and (iii) evidence from scientific literature. Results: The major barriers to easy access of ECP include misconceptions and <b>reservations</b> of <b>providers</b> (disapproval of ECP provision by CHWs, opposition to its being an OTC product, and myths, misconceptions, and moral judgments about its users) including influential gynecologists. Conclusion: For mainstreaming ECP, the paper recommends educational campaign focusing on gynecologists and CHWs, relaxing restrictive policy on advertisement of ECP, involving press media and strengthening supply chain to ensure its regular supply to ASHA (CHW) ...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years the concept of Smart cities has emerged to {{transform}} urban areas into connected and well informed spaces. Services that make smart cities “smart” are curated by using data streams of smart cities i. e., inhabitants’ location information, digital engagement, transportation, environment and local government data. Accumulating and processing of these data streams raise security and privacy concerns at individual and community levels. Sizeable {{attempts have been made to}} ensure the security and privacy of inhabitants’ data. However, the security and privacy issues of smart cities are not only confined to inhabitants; service providers and local governments have their own <b>reservations</b> – service <b>provider</b> trust, reliability of the sensed data, and data ownership, to name a few. In this research we identified a comprehensive list of stakeholders and modelled their involvement in smart cities by using the Onion Model approach. Based on the model we present a security and privacy-aware framework for service provisioning in smart cities, namely the ‘Smart Secure Service Provisioning’ (SSServProv) Framework. Unlike previous attempts, our framework provides end-to-end security and privacy features for trustable data acquisition, transmission, processing and legitimate service provisioning. The proposed framework ensures inhabitants’ privacy, and also guarantees integrity of services. It also ensures that public data is never misused by malicious service providers. To demonstrate the efficacy of SSServProv we developed and tested core functionalities of authentication, authorisation and lightweight secure communication protocol for data acquisition and service provisioning. For various smart cities service provisioning scenarios we verified these protocols by an automated security verification tool called Scyther...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Pakistan {{was among}} the leading {{countries}} in south Asia which started the family planning program in late 50 s, forecasting the need to control the population. Despite this early intervention, fertility rate has declined but slower in Pakistan as compared to most other Asian countries. Pakistan has almost a stagnant contraceptive prevalence rate {{for more than a}} decade now, perhaps owing to the inadequate performance of the family planning programs. The provision and use of long term contraceptives such as IUCD has always been low (around 2 %) and associated with numerous issues. Married women who want to wait before having another child, or end childbearing altogether, are not using any long term method of contraception. Methodology A descriptive qualitative study was conducted from May to July 2012, to explore and understand the perceptions of women regarding the use of IUCDs and to understand the challenges/issues at the service provider’s end. Six FGDs with community women and 12 in-depth interviews were conducted with family planning providers. The data was analyzed using the Qualitative Content Analysis approach. Results The study revealed that the family planning clients are reluctant to use IUCDs because of a number of myths and misconceptions associated with the method. They have <b>reservations</b> about the <b>provider’s</b> capability and quality of care at the facility. Private health providers are not motivated and are reluctant to provide the IUCDs because of inadequate counseling skills, lack of competence and improper supporting infrastructure. Government programs either do not have enough supplies or trained staff to promote the IUCD utilization. Conclusion Besides a well-designed community awareness campaign, providers’ communication and counseling skills have to be enhanced, as these are major contributing factors in IUCD acceptance. Ongoing training of all family planning service providers in IUCD insertion is very important, along with strengthening of their services. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{research}} task of this Master’s Thesis is {{to define}} and analyze potential markets related of projector-sensor technology in hospitality industry and to define service concepts and business ecosystems related to projector-sensor technology. From an academic point of view this study aims to participate in discussion around the concepts of customer value and business ecosystem. This is done by analyzing market potential of a value proposition through business biosphere -framework. The key element of business biosphere -framework is a business ecosystem developed around a customer value in dynamic business environment. It is influenced by economic, technological and social changes of business environment. From managerial point of view {{the aim is to}} demonstrate an example of market potential analysis of value propositions under development. Expected results of the study are to spot growing needs in the hospitality industry and to assess value propositions related to the technology for their market potential. From this setting it is expected to point possibilities for business opportunities and suggestions for the further development of the dynamic lighting technology from demand point-of-view. The study was conducted as an exploratory research with inductive orientation, demonstrating qualitative research methods capturing market intuition. The methods used for the market potential analysis were visionary industry expert interviews, trends and future scenarios. The analysis of the data was done through categorizing the data first to benefits noted based on needs of the industry and concerns related to challenges of projector-sensor technology, followed by theming the data under three themes: economic view, social view and technological view. Finally, the data was compared to an industry review. According to the results of the empiric research, the most appreciated benefits of projector-sensor technology in hospitality environment are: enhancing customer experience by creating atmospheres, automating certain parts of service process through internal information transfer and enabling flexible service through easy update and control of customer information. The concerns related to challenges could be grouped under keywords of: lack of personal touch during service, customer experience issues such as ease of use and relevant content, connectivity to other systems, and functionality issues such as total price in use including installation and maintenance. The results of the study reveal that several participant companies need to be involved in creating value propositions actually valuable for the industry. Such are: user experience expert, strategic marketing expert, graphic designer, software provider, hardware provider, installation specialist, entertainment provider, translator, customer service and technological support. Equally important is the co-operation with existing <b>reservation</b> system <b>provider,</b> cashier system provider and membership system provider. The main conclusions of the research were that: business biosphere appears to be applicable framework to analyzing potential markets, there can be seen market potential for the projector-sensor technology in hospitality environment and when developing value propositions further, the economic, technological and social views should all be considered. The individual notions of the interviews conducted within this research also seemed to follow the major trends of the industry, suggesting, that the framework would be applicable also in other time or place...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background When detected, HIV can be {{effectively}} treated with antiretroviral therapy. Nevertheless in the U. S. approximately 25 % {{of those who}} are HIV-infected do not know it. Much remains unknown about how to increase HIV testing rates. New Internet outreach methods have the potential to increase disease awareness and screening among patients, especially as electronic personal health records (PHRs) become more widely available. In the US Department of Veterans' Affairs medical care system, 900, 000 veterans have indicated an interest in receiving electronic health-related communications through the PHR. Therefore we sought to evaluate the optimal circumstances and conditions for outreach about HIV screening. In an exploratory, qualitative research study we examined patient and provider perceptions of Internet-based outreach to increase HIV screening among veterans who use the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) health care system. Findings We conducted two rounds of focus groups with veterans and healthcare providers at VHA medical centers. The study's first phase elicited general perceptions of an electronic outreach program to increase screening for HIV, diabetes, and high cholesterol. Using phase 1 results, outreach message texts were drafted and then presented to participants in the second phase. Analysis followed modified grounded theory. Patients and providers indicated that electronic outreach through a PHR would provide useful information and would motivate patients to be screened for HIV. Patients believed that electronic information would be more convenient and understandable than information provided verbally. Patients saw little difference between messages about HIV versus about diabetes and cholesterol. Providers, however, felt patients would disapprove of HIV-related messages due to stigma. Providers expected increased workload from the electronic outreach, and thus suggested adding primary care resources and devising methods to smooth the flow of patients getting screened. When provided a choice between unsecured emails versus PHRs as the delivery mechanism for disease screening messages, both patients and providers preferred PHRs. Conclusions There is considerable potential to use PHR systems for electronic outreach and social marketing to communicate to patients about, and increase rates of, disease screening, including for HIV. Planning for direct-to-patient communications through PHRs should include providers and address <b>provider</b> <b>reservations,</b> especially about workload increases. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{staff at}} the University of North Dakota Health Sciences Library has {{continuously}} done outreach to North Dakota Indian reservation communities {{for the past four}} years. Funding was from the National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NN/LM) Greater Midwest Region subcontracts and training grants. Description of Projects: 1. Consumer Health Subcontract March 2002 —September 2003 focusing on tribal college librarians and users of North Dakota’s five tribal college libraries. The project trained librarians, purchased computers for libraries, purchased a subscription to a full-text health database, and developed a web site, Linking Native Americans to Health Information 2. Training grant, August 2003, trained Fort Berthold Reservation Community Health Representatives (CHRs) to access health information on the Internet, and served as a pilot project for the Outreach to Health Professionals Subcontract. 3. Outreach to Health Professionals Subcontract, April 2004 – December 2005 had three objectives: a. Train <b>reservation</b> health care <b>providers.</b> b. Reinforce, strengthen, and maintain a working relationship with the tribal college librarians. c. Expand the Linking Native Americans to Health Information web site. Challenges and effective practices: 1. Priorities are different for tribal college librarians. They have severe time constraints. Being patient and consistent are important. 2. There are often technology limitations. Although Internet access and equipment in tribal colleges are often very good, the librarians may not be technologically proficient nor have control over their Web pages. Directly approaching the colleges’ IT staffs about adding links is an option. 3. Determining IP ranges was difficult. Some colleges contract with local Internet providers, while others use the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Each case must be approached on an individual basis. The librarians often had little knowledge of their systems, and it was effective to contact the IT staff directly. 4. There were cultural considerations in approaching the colleges and the health care providers. Learning as much as possible about health issues and communication styles was helpful. Training materials focusing on the group’s health problems is appreciated. 5. When doing outreach to the health providers, especially IHS staff, scheduling time for training was difficult. Either the administrative officer or the medical director is the best contact, but the demands on both are many. The IHS facilities are hectic, and they are reluctant to make time for training. 6. Selling the value of the training to the IHS facilities was difficult. At the IHS facilities, physicians rely on Up-To-Date and Micromedex. Many are not doing “research,” so PubMed was not important. The counter to resistance is to be persistent and flexible. Introductory in-person visits proved helpful in some cases. 7. When working with the tribal health departments, making the right contact can be difficult. Once a contact is found, they are often more receptive to training than IHS. Having an advocate who promotes the advantages of training and provides assistance in making arrangements, is most effective. 8. Be wary of tribal politics. If there is unrest politically, tribal health personnel are reluctant to make any commitments. Relax and wait until later. This project is supported under contract no.
