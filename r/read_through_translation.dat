One {{of the reasons why}} English is taught and regarded as a compulsory subject at our school is that English is used as international language. Although the English teacher of MTs Nurul Huda Matangaji Sumber has taught English, especially <b>reading</b> ability, <b>through</b> <b>translation</b> method to the students, but they still find difficult to understand. for this reason, the writer would help the student improve their English by teaching this foreign language, particularly the teaching of <b>reading</b> ability <b>through</b> the direct method. The aims of the research that will be obtained are to find out the data of the results of students ability in understanding <b>reading</b> texts taught <b>through</b> direct method, in understanding <b>reading</b> texts taught <b>through</b> <b>translation</b> method, and to find out the data of whether there is any positive comparisons between the direct method toward students ability in understanding reading texts. After the data have been analyzed, the writer concludes that the result of students ability in understanding <b>reading</b> texts taught <b>through</b> direct method is categorized as ‘good’ because the mean score achieved by each student is 7. 16, the results of students ability in understanding reading texts taught though translation method is categorized as ‘sufficient’ because the mean score achieved by each student is 6. 07, and there is a positive comparison. it is proved by the data analysis using t-test formula which shows that the value of tobserved (3. 323) is higher than the critical value of t-table (1. 99) with the significance 5...|$|R

More specifically, the study aimed to study the resilience cognitive and meta-cognitive effect on raising L 2 <b>reading</b> comprehension <b>through</b> <b>translation.</b> Secondly, the study aimed at pursuing the views and attitudes to find out the extent to which resilience in reading comprehension can predict ESP learners’ translation ability. In order to test the null hypotheses, three phases were taken into consideration. First, 120 female adult sophomores majoring at Iran University of Medical Sciences were chosen through a homogeneity test. Second, the participants’ translation ability was measured <b>through</b> a <b>translation</b> task and also the validity of this instrument was confirmed by the three professors of the university, and the translation Toolkit Evaluation of UTAH University was used to evaluate the translated works. Next, the participants' reading comprehension ability was determined and finally, Connor and Davidson’s (2003) resilience scale was used to find out the level of resilience in reading comprehension of ESP students. The results of data analyses firstly revealed that there was a statistically significant relationship between Iranian ESP learners’ translation ability and their resilience in reading comprehension. Secondly, it was revealed that there was a significant positive relationship between Iranian ESP learners’ translation ability and their reading comprehension. The findings of the present study could have implications for EFL teachers and learners in the Iranian context...|$|R
40|$|Book synopsis: THE COMPLETE SAGAS OF ICELANDERS from Leifur Eiriksson Publishing are {{the first}} English {{translation}} of the entire corpus of the Sagas of Icelanders together with the forty-nine Tales connected with them. Thirty translators were carefully selected for the project, including leading international scholars and university teachers from seven countries who have studied and written on Nordic medieval literature and culture. All the translators are native English speakers and writers. Careful editorial planning and coordination ensured that translators followed the same translation policy and produced the same high level of accuracy and readability. Coordination work included use of consistent English terms for key words and concepts, recurrent proverbs and phrases, and other cultural realia. Spelling conventions for personal and place names were normalised, as were translations of nicknames occurring {{in more than one}} Saga. Eleven Icelandic medieval specialists then carefully checked the translations against the original Icelandic texts to ensure accurate renderings and returned them to the translators for revision. A further revision stage concentrated on the English style, when fourteen native English-speaking scholars <b>read</b> <b>through</b> the <b>translations</b> before the translators gave them a final polish. The publishers are confident that these extensive editorial efforts have produced sound, quality translations. While they reflect the expertise of scholars in this specialist field, a prime concern was to produce a text in smooth and readable modern English. There are probably few examples of comparable coordinated translations of an entire literary corpus into another language...|$|R

If you are {{the author of this}} thesis and would like to make it openly available in the Institutional Repository please contact: repository@lboro. ac. ukThis is a new study of Salman Rushdie's fiction, <b>reading</b> his texts <b>through</b> <b>translation</b> theory. Going beyond previous studies of Rushdie's writing, the majority of which have been postcolonial critiques, or have aimed to illuminate obscure references, my study engages with those images which are interesting to postcolonial studies and <b>reads</b> them <b>through</b> their relevance to the theory of translation. Engaging with texts on translation including those by Walter Benjamin, George Steiner, Lawrence Venuti, Andre Lefevere, Susan Bassnett and Harish Trivedi, as well as other theoretical perspectives (including postcolonial, postmodern, and linguistic theory), my study equally interrogates Rushdie's fiction and related aspects of translation theory. My thesis begins by examining images of the harem and the veil and suggests that these images denote the untranslatable. Further chapters suggest that the figure of the translator is a transgressor, and that transgression is necessary in order to translate. Ideas of linguistic creativity, clumsiness, slang, and bad language in the novels are opposed with the translator's goal of textual perfection. I examine the prophetic angel figure as an example of miscommunication, suggesting the relationship between translation and prophecy. Other disruptions to communication include those caused by the temptations of food, and the madness which Babel causes, and which may be dispelled with the advent of a post-translation, unilingual, utopian future. The final chapter suggests that the short story form (a less studied part of Rushdie's bibliography) provides a solution to problematic translations {{because of the nature of}} the narrator's voice in the short story which employs direct communication with the reader...|$|R

2500|$|The author Henry James {{offered a}} mixed opinion on Middlemarch, opining {{that it is}} [...] "at {{once one of the}} strongest and one of the weakest of English novels". His {{greatest}} criticism ("the only eminent failure in the book") was towards the character of Ladislaw, who he felt to be an insubstantial hero-figure against that of Lydgate. The scenes between Lydgate and Rosamond he especially praised, on account of their psychological depth—he doubted whether there were any scenes [...] "more powerfully real [...] intelligent" [...] in all English fiction. Thérèse Bentzon, writing for the Revue des deux Mondes, was highly critical of Middlemarch. Although finding merit in certain scenes and qualities, Bentzon faulted the structure of the novel, describing it as being [...] "made up of a succession of unconnected chapters, following each other at random [...] the final effect is one of an incoherence which nothing can justify". In her view, Eliot's prioritisation of [...] "observation rather than imagination [...] inexorable analysis rather than sensibility, passion or fantasy" [...] means that she should not be held amongst the first ranks of novelists. German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who <b>read</b> Middlemarch <b>through</b> a <b>translation</b> owned by his mother and sister, derided the novel for construing suffering as a means of expiating the debt of sin, which he found characteristic of [...] "little moralistic females à la Eliot." ...|$|R

It was an experimental study in which there were two groups as the sample classified into the experimental and control groups. The population of the study was 162 second grade students of SMA Negeri 1 Gandapura, and 44 students were chosen as the sample through random sampling technique. For the experimental group the sample was represented by class IPA 2 that consisted of 21 students, while for the control class the sample was represented by class IPA 3 that consisted 23 students. The data were collected <b>through</b> a <b>reading</b> comprehension test and a set of questionnaire. The data from the test were analyzed by using independent t-test assisted by the software SPSS version 22. Based on the t-index maintained from the analysis, {{it was found that the}} significant difference between the two groups was 0. 73 which was higher than ? = 0. 05. Moreover, the t-count is 3. 12, and it was higher than t-table which was 2. 01. The finding showed that there is a significant difference in achievement between the students who were taught reading comprehension by using TBLT and those who were taught <b>reading</b> comprehension <b>through</b> GTM. Hence, the alternative hypothesis is accepted and the null hypothesis is rejected. Furthermore, the result of the data analysis from the questionnaire showed that 78. 57 % of the students responded positively toward the implementation of TBLT.

Utilising a quantitative and qualitative research design, 28 English teachers from several schools in Dungun, Terengganu were chosen as respondents for the study. Four research objectives for the study were (i) English teachers' knowledge and understanding on phonics approach, (ii) English teachers' perception on students' knowledge and ability in phonics {{in the teaching of}} <b>reading</b> <b>through</b> phonics approach, (iii) English teachers' challenges in teaching <b>reading</b> <b>through</b> phonics approach in early reading and (iv) suggestion in implementing teaching English <b>reading</b> <b>through</b> phonics approach. Two instruments namely Teacher Knowledge Assessment: Structure of Language (TKA:SL) questionnaire adapted from Mather, Bos & Babur (2001) and Teacher Perceptions towards Early Reading and Spelling (TPERS) Deford (1985) were used for the study. In addition, semi-structured interview were conducted in getting further information from the teachers. The findings of the study showed that (i) the teachers have moderate level of knowledge and understanding in teaching <b>reading</b> <b>through</b> phonic approach (ii) it is also revealed that phonological awareness knowledge and spelling skills are important for the emergent readers. Based on the study, it can be concluded that English teachers' knowledge and understanding in teaching <b>reading</b> <b>through</b> phonics approach is inadequate.
