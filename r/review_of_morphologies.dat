40|$|The exquisitely {{preserved}} longipterygid enantiornithine Rapaxavis pani is redescribed {{here after}} more extensive prepara− tion. A complete <b>review</b> <b>of</b> its <b>morphology</b> is presented {{based on information}} gathered before and after preparation. Among other features, Rapaxavis pani is characterized by having an elongate rostrum (close to 60 % of the skull length), rostrally restricted dentition, and schizorhinal external nares. Yet, the most puzzling feature of this bird {{is the presence of}} a pair of pectoral bones (here termed paracoracoidal ossifications) that, {{with the exception of the}} enantiornithine Concornis lacustris, are unknown within Aves. Particularly notable is the presence of a distal tarsal cap, formed by the fu− sion of distal tarsal elements, a feature that is controversial in non−ornithuromorph birds. The holotype and only known specimen of Rapaxavis pani thus reveals important information for better understanding the anatomy and phylogenetic relationships of longipterygids, in particular, as well as basal birds as a whole...|$|R

50|$|Mitochondrial DNA {{analysis}} {{indicates a}} deep divergence between a northern clade (containing T. teguixin, T. longilineus, T. palustris and T. quadrilineatus) and a southern clade (containing T. merianae, T. rufescens and T. duseni.). The {{northern and southern}} clades are morphologically distinct, with the northern clade possessing {{a single pair of}} loreal scales between the eye and the nostril and a smooth texture to the scales on the body, and the southern clade possessing two pairs of loreal scales and a bumpy texture to the scales on the body. At least one recent <b>review</b> <b>of</b> the <b>morphology</b> <b>of</b> the Teiidae family has placed the tegus of the southern clade in the genus Salvator. Subsequent studies support the paraphyletic status of Tupinambis, though further research will be necessary to determine if the split will gain wider acceptance among the herpetological community. Comparative analysis of hemipenial anatomy also provides support for the split between Tupinambis and Salvator. Tegus probably originated sometime during the Cenozoic era. Tupinambis fossils from Argentina date back to the late-Miocene period. Fossils of the extinct tegu Paradracaena can be found in earlier Miocene deposits.|$|R

40|$|The chapter {{presents}} a <b>review</b> <b>of</b> the <b>morphology</b> and functions <b>of</b> tanycytes. The name “tanycyte,” {{derived from the}} Greek word “tanus,” which means “elongated,” was chosen to stress the shape of these bipolar cells, in relation at their apical pole with the infundibular recess of the third ventricle and, at their distal pole, with the portal vessels of the median eminence and {{the floor of the}} brain. The <b>morphology</b> <b>of</b> tanycytes has been thoroughly explored by means of photonic observations as well as by transmission (TEM) and scanning (SEM) electron microscopy. The <b>review</b> <b>of</b> the chapter will be restricted to the tanycytes lining the ventral region of the third ventricle in mammals, thus, excluding the study of similar cells lining the circumventricular organs (subfornical organ, subcommissural organ, organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis), the aqueduct, and the floor of the fourth ventricle. The possible functions of the tanycytes will also be reviewed. The Golgi impregnation has been used by several authors to study the <b>morphology</b> <b>of</b> the tanycytes in mammals. Because of the thickness of the sections impregnated by this method, it is possible in favorable incidences to follow the entire length of these elongated cells, allowing a dissection in situ. This method demonstrates two main types of tanycytes according to their location and their morphology. The ventral tanycytes are located on the floor and lower third of the infundibular recess. Dorsal tanycytes have a longer tail process, starting {{from the base of the}} tanycyte and arching ventrolaterally in the neuropil of the arcuate nucleus. Glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and glucosed-phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) are more active in the perikaryons of β tanycytes as compared to α. © 1985, Elsevier Science & Technology.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} <b>review</b> <b>of</b> the <b>morphology,</b> anatomy, taxonomy, {{chemistry and}} {{ecology of the}} endemic New Zealand facultative shrub epiphyte Pittosporum cornifolium (Pittosporaceae) is presented. Strong habitat specificity restricts this species to lowland forest and coastal habitats, which are widely yet discontinuously distributed north of latitude 42 ° 15 ′S. Pittosporum cornifolium is typically associated with old growth forest systems and low nutrient substrates, with low mean daily temperatures in the coldest month (0. 5 kPa) apparently restricting its distribution. Significant morphological variability is evident in leaves and flowers, especially with respect to plants from the Poor Knights Islands. Genetic analyses of five mainland populations and individuals representing Poor Knights Islands populations revealed relatively low genetic diversity at the population level {{which is likely to}} be the result of geographic isolation. Molecular phylogenetic studies suggest a New Caledonian origin for the species with close affinities to both P. pimeleoides subspecies. Several lines of evidence suggest recognition of the Poor Knights Islands entity as a new taxon. However, analysis of additional morphological, reproductive and molecular data across the full geographic range will be required to confirm current inferences. Although populations have declined, P. cornifolium is not currently threatened, however, it should be considered for reintroduction to sites in districts where its range has been severely reduced...|$|R
40|$|International Association for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT) 2015. New {{morphological}} and phylogenetic data prompt us {{to present}} an updated <b>review</b> <b>of</b> floral <b>morphology</b> and its evolution in the basal ANITA grade of living angiosperms, Chloranthaceae, and Ceratophyllum. Floral phyllotaxis is complex whorled in Nymphaeales and spiral in Amborella and Austrobaileyales. It is unresolved whether phyllotaxis was ancestrally whorled or spiral, {{but if it was}} whorled, the whorls were trimerous. The flowers are probably ancestrally bisexual because in most families with unisexual flowers these flowers exhibit rudiments of the opposite sex. Carpels are largely ascidiate and the closure line is short, either transverse or longitudinal. A style is usually absent or, if present, generally short and not plicate. Angiospermy (carpel sealing) is by secretion, rather than postgenital fusion, except in large-flowered Nymphaeales and in Illicium, correlated with unusual fruits. Carpels with a single, median, pendent ovule are probably plesiomorphic. Chloranthaceae and Ceratophyllaceae have an unsettled phylogenetic position, but in some phylogenetic analyses they form a clade, which may be sister to the remaining mesangiosperms (Magnoliidae, monocots, eudicots). This position is supported by their carpel characters, which {{are similar to those of}} the ANITA grade and different from those of most other mesangiosperms...|$|R
40|$|Background: The jugular foramen, {{the bony}} opening {{on the base}} of skull, is an opening through which pass the ninth, tenth, and {{eleventh}} cranial nerves, two dural sinuses, and the meningeal branches of the occipital and ascending pharyngeal arteries. The increasing use of modern diagnostic procedures and new surgical approaches has created a need for much more detailed anatomical studies and explanations. This article reveals some additional features. Material and Methods: 324 jugular foramina of skulls of persons of unknown age and gender were examined. The morphological characteristics of all the investigated jugular foramina were described, measured, and compared, taking into consideration their side. Results: Jugular foramina were studied for a <b>review</b> <b>of</b> its <b>morphology,</b> morphometry and its comparison with previous studies. Different shapes and sizes of jugular foramen were seen. Laterality was also noticed, compartmentation was also observed which was found to be statistically significant. Conclusions: A detailed examination of the jugular foramen anatomy was performed. The main types of jugular foramina and the frequencies of bipartite or tripartite division were established. Several dimensions of the parts of the jugular foramen were measured. Some new data could provide important information about the anatomy of the jugular foramen for reliable surgica...|$|R
