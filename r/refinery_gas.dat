40|$|Chemical-looping {{combustion}} (CLC) of gaseous fuels, such {{as natural}} or <b>refinery</b> <b>gas,</b> {{could be a}} viable option {{in a variety of}} industries for production of heat and electricity with CCS. Further, CLC can be combined with conventional steam–methane reforming for efficient carbon-neutral hydrogen production. A series of collaborate European projects have been carried out since 2002, which focused on oxygen-carrier development and upscaling of both the CLC process and oxygen-carrier production with natural gas and <b>refinery</b> <b>gas</b> as fuel. In the latest project, SUCCESS (2013 - 2017), a series of oxygen carriers based on Fe and Ca-Mn materials were developed using commercial and low-cost raw materials. Two commercial methods for particle production were used: impregnation of Fe 2 O 3 on Al 2 O 3 and spray-drying of CaMnO 3. In this paper, selected results are presented from investigation of these two promising oxygen carriers using a laboratory-scale unit with continuous operation and a nominal fuel input of 10 kWth. In this unit, the gas velocities in the riser and in the grid jet zone of the gas distributor come close to gas velocities of industrial-scale units and the material is exposed to a large number of redox cycles. Therefore, this unit is highly applicable for judging particle lifetime. Both materials functioned well during operation with natural gas, with little or no agglomeration. The total time with fuel was 30 h and > 100 h for the impregnated Fe-based material and the Ca-Mn-based material, respectively. Although the degree of elutriation was high for both materials, the actual fines production (< 45 µm) was high only initially, but decreased as a function of time. Almost full gas yield to CO 2 could be obtained with the spray-dried Ca-Mn-based material, and up to 85 % yield was obtained with the impregnated oxygen carrier based on Fe at 950 °C...|$|E
