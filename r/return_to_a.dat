5|$|The Mascarene {{martin has}} a heavy flight with slow wingbeats {{interspersed}} with glides, and may repeatedly <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> favourite perch. This martin {{is often seen}} perched on wires, and sometimes rests on sandy beaches. The martin roosts in small flocks in bushes, on buildings or on cliffs. Sometimes it is joined at the roost by other birds, such as blue-cheeked bee-eaters in the Seychelles.|$|E

The record was produced by Miguel, who was assisted by Kiko Cibrian, Rudy Pérez, David Foster, and Juan Luis Guerra.|$|E
5|$|As soon as {{he arrived}} home, Etty began to work on {{ensuring}} he {{had at least one}} picture ready for the 1824 Summer Exhibition. He decided to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> theme for which he had created a sketch in 1820, that of the story of Pandora and in particular the passage in Hesiod in which the seasons crown her with a wreath. He had exhibited a sketch in 1820 on the same theme, and had already decided on the arrangement of the figures. His first attempt in 1824 was abandoned half-finished, and he began again on a smaller canvas with different positioning of the key figures of Pandora, Vulcan and Venus.|$|E
5|$|Boxes play a {{prominent}} role in Crash Bandicoot: Warped and can be broken with all of Crash's techniques. Boxes contain helpful items or can augment Crash's mobility. Check Point boxes allow the player to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> specific point in the stage upon losing a life. TNT Boxes explode after a three-second fuse when jumped on, while Nitro Boxes explode upon any physical contact. All of the Nitro Boxes in a level can be detonated at once if a green-colored box with an exclamation point (!) on it is touched; contact with this box is necessary in obtaining the level's Gem, as Nitro Boxes count towards the total number of boxes broken in the level.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, when {{alternative}} rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as {{a pioneer of}} the genre. The band then released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound and catapulted it to international fame. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> more rock-oriented sound, but still continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members.|$|E
5|$|Declaring herself {{recovered}} from injury {{and ready to}} <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> complete season of competitive golf in 2008, Sörenstam opened the year at the SBS Open at Turtle Bay where she captured her 70th LPGA Tour victory and first since September 2006. She won next at the Stanford International Pro-Am in April then following a week off, won again at the Michelob ULTRA Open at Kingsmill in a tournament record score, giving her three wins and over $1million in earnings by mid-May. It was her 72nd and final ever win on the LPGA Tour.|$|E

Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe liked the combination of energetic riffs and cynical lyrics {{about the state of the}} world. Loudwires Chad Bowar said Dystopia was a first-rate Megadeth album and praised the interplay between Mustaine and Loureiro.|$|E

5|$|Eclipses {{can occur}} {{only when the}} Sun is within about 15 to 18 degrees of a node, (10 to 12 degrees for central eclipses). This is {{referred}} to as an eclipse limit. In the time it takes for the Moon to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> node (draconic month), the apparent position of the Sun has moved about 29 degrees, relative to the nodes. Since the eclipse limit creates a window of opportunity of up to 36 degrees (24 degrees for central eclipses), it is possible for partial eclipses (or rarely a partial and a central eclipse) to occur in consecutive months.|$|E
5|$|Findings {{from the}} Dawn {{spacecraft}} have {{found evidence that}} the troughs that wrap around Vesta could be graben formed by impact-induced faulting (see Troughs section above), meaning that Vesta has more complex geology than other asteroids. Vesta could have been classified as a dwarf planet if it had retained a spherical shape, and it has other qualities {{that lead to the}} thought it could be a protoplanet. The only thing that knocked it out of the category of a dwarf planet was the formation of two large impact basins at its southern pole. At the time of these impacts Vesta was not warm and plastic enough to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> shape in hydrostatic equilibrium.|$|E

The team's financial backer, Andrei Cheglakov, later revealed that Bianchi's crash was a key factor in the Russian's decision to end his financial support of the team and quit Formula One.|$|E

5|$|However, SERN learns of {{the time}} machine and sends a group to {{retrieve}} it, killing Mayuri in the process. Using Kurisu's time leap machine, Rintarō travels back in time numerous times {{to try to save}} Mayuri, but to no avail. As Rintarō reaches wit's end, he is approached by Suzuha Amane, a girl from a future ruled by SERN due to their possession of a time machine, who tells him that he needs to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Beta world line in which Mayuri won't die. By undoing the effects of the D-Mails that caused shifts in the time line, Rintarō regains possession of an IBN 5100 PC that they lost earlier, allowing them to crack into SERN's systems and delete the evidence of Rintarō's original D-Mail. However, Rintarō realizes that by doing so, he would have to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> world line in which Kurisu is dead. After realizing their feelings for each other, Kurisu tells Rintarō to save Mayuri. Reluctantly, Rintarō agrees and deletes the evidence of his D-Mail from SERN's database, returning him to the Beta world line.|$|E
5|$|I was to {{keep the}} fish before me in a tin tray, and {{occasionally}} moisten the surface with alcohol from the jar... In ten minutes I had seen all that could be seen in that fish, and started in search of the Professor – who had, however, left the Museum; and when I returned, after lingering over some of the odd animals stored in the upper apartment, my specimen was dry all over. I dashed the fluid over the fish as if to resuscitate the beast from a fainting fit, and looked with anxiety for a return of the normal sloppy appearance. This little excitement over, nothing was done but to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> steadfast gaze at my mute companion.|$|E

5|$|In 1896 Henry Morrison Flagler {{brought the}} Florida East Coast Railway to Miami. Mary Ann and William Davis {{had dreamed of}} {{building}} a city on Key Biscayne. Now their son Waters was a retired millionaire, and interested only in preserving Key Biscayne as a quiet retreat for his family. For a while Flagler's arrival did disturb their quiet, as Flagler brought in dredges to deepen the Cape Florida Channel and the approaches {{to the mouth of}} the Miami River, muddying the formerly clear waters of Biscayne Bay. Soon, however, a shorter route from the ocean to Miami was dredged through the southern end of what is now Miami Beach, at Government Cut, and the Cape Florida Channel was allowed to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> natural state.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species are}} solitary when not mating, {{though a few}} are known to occur in high densities and with {{frequent}} interactions, signaling, mate defending and eviction of individuals from dens. This is likely the result of abundant food supplies combined with limited den sites. Octopuses hide in dens, which are typically crevices in rocky outcrops or other hard structures, though some species burrow into sand or mud. Octopuses are not territorial but generally remain in a home range; they may leave the area in search of food. They can use navigation skills to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> den without having to retrace their outward route. They are not known to be migratory.|$|E
5|$|Rieve and his {{executive}} officer were both severely criticized {{for failing to}} take all possible steps to save Karlsruhe in a later investigation into the sinking.

In addition, the forward pumps still had power, and so the flooding could have been slowed enough to permit a <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> safe harbor.|$|E
