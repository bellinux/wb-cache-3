30|$|The {{evaluation}} of a new solution in Case A increases the number of candidate solutions only in A- 3. In Case B, the number of candidate solutions can be decreased by the <b>re-evaluation</b> <b>of</b> a candidate solution whenever x_t- 1 ∈ S_t- 1 holds (i.e., in B- 1 and B- 2). Only in B- 3, the <b>re-evaluation</b> <b>of</b> a candidate solution in Case B does not decrease the number of candidate solutions. However, in B- 3, x_t ∈ S_t always holds after the <b>re-evaluation</b> <b>of</b> x_t. As a result, the re-evaluation at the (t+ 1)th evaluation always decreases the number of candidate solutions. This means {{that the number of}} candidate solutions can be always decreased by iterating the re-evaluation twice.|$|R
40|$|Optical imaging {{studies of}} {{somatosensory}} cortex (SI) in primates {{has led to}} <b>re-evaluation</b> <b>of</b> our understanding of cortical functional organization. This chapter describes findings showing that somatosensory topography, long a foundation of cortical function, {{may not be as}} precise in the awake monkey, suggesting a <b>re-evaluation</b> <b>of</b> the relationship between topographic representation and sensory precision. Optical maps of the tactile funneling illusion, which demonstrate a map of how tactile stimuli are perceived rather than a map of skin topography, call for a <b>re-evaluation</b> <b>of</b> topographic representation in SI as a body map. With respect to representation of sensory submodalities, optical images of vibrotactile pressure, flutter, and vibration domains reveal striking similarities and differences between modality maps in visual and somatosensory cortices...|$|R
