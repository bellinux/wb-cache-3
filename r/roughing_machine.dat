40|$|In the {{manufacture}} of parts with sculptured cavities from prismatic stock, <b>rough</b> <b>machining</b> usually constitutes most of the machining time owing to the {{significant difference between the}} stock and the part shape. When using 21 / 2 -D milling or a contour-map approach to do the <b>rough</b> <b>machining,</b> the appropriate selection of tool-path pattern for each cutting layer can significantly reduce <b>rough</b> <b>machining</b> time and hence increase productivity. In this paper, the commonly used toolpath patterns are summarised. A knowledge-based parametric approach for optimising the toolpath pattern of a given cutting layer is proposed. Then, a novel methodology is developed to calculate an arbitrary polygon area and locate the concave cavities in the polygon. Procedures for cutting-layer-shape analysis and the optimal comprehensive tool-path pattern generation are also built and proposed in this paper. These procedures can not only be applied to sculptured cavity parts with simple islands, but also to parts with arbitrarily-shaped islands. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the reasoning process. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in the volume of <b>rough</b> <b>machining</b> on the CBV area {{is one of the}} indicators of increased efficiencyof machining process. Normally, this area is not subject to the <b>rough</b> <b>machining</b> process, so that the volume {{of the rest of the}} material is still big. With the addition of CC point and tool orientation to CBV area on a complex surface, the finishing will be faster because the volume of the excess material on this process will be reduced. This paper presents a method for volume calculation of the parts which do not allow further occurrence of the machining process, particulary for <b>rough</b> <b>machining</b> on a complex object. By comparing the total volume of raw materials and machining area volume, the volume of residual material,on which machining process cannot be done,can be determined. The volume of the total machining area has been taken into account for machiningof the CBV and non CBV areas. By using delaunay triangulation for the triangle which includes the machining and CBV areas. The volume will be calculated using Divergence(Gaussian) theorem by focusing on the direction of the normal vector on each triangle. This method can be used as an alternative to selecting tothe <b>rough</b> <b>machining</b> methods which select minimum value of nonmachinable volume so that effectiveness can be achieved in the machining process...|$|R

It is quite intuitive that the multi-resolution feature can be utilized to simplify generation of NC (Numerical Control) tool paths for <b>rough</b> <b>machining.</b> In this paper, a new method of parallel NC tool path generation for subdivision surfaces is presented. The basic idea of the method includes two steps: first, extending G-Buffer to a strip buffer (called S-Buffer) by dividing the working area into strips to generate NC tool paths for objects of large size; second, generating NC tool paths by parallel implementation of S-Buffer based on MPI (Message Passing Interface). Moreover, the recursion depth of the surface can be estimated for a user-specified error tolerance, so we substitute the polyhedral mesh for the limit surface during <b>rough</b> <b>machining.</b> Furthermore, we exploit the locality of S-Buffer and develop a dynamic division and load-balanced strategy to effectively parallelize S-Buffer.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} geometric {{process planning}} in four-axis <b>rough</b> <b>machining.</b> A {{review of existing literature}} provides {{a foundation for}} process planning in machining; efficiency (tool path length) is identified as a primary concern. Emergent structures (thin webs and strings) are proposed as a new metric of process robustness. Previous research efforts are contrasted to establish motivation for improvements in these areas in four-axis <b>rough</b> <b>machining.</b> The original research is presented as a journal article. This research develops a new methodology for quickly estimating the remaining stock during a plurality of 2 y D cuts defined by their depth and orientation relative to a rotary fourth axis. Unlike existing tool path simulators, this method can be performed independently of (and thus prior to) tool path generation. The algorithms presented use polyhedral mesh surface input to create and analyze polygonal slices, which are again reconstructed into polyhedral surfaces. At the slice level, nearly all operations are Boolean in nature, allowing simple implementation. A novel heuristic for polyhedral reconstruction for this application is presented. Results are shown for sample components, showing a significant reduction in overall <b>rough</b> <b>machining</b> tool path length. The discussion of future work provides a brief discussion of how this new methodology can be applied to detecting thin webs and strings prior to tool path planning or machining. The methodology presented in this work provides a novel method of calculating remaining stock such that it can be performed during process planning, prior to committing to tool path generation...|$|R
