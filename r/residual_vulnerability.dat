40|$|This thesis explores {{cognitive}} {{vulnerability to}} {{depression and the}} interplay between genetic and environmental influences. Cognitive vulnerability to depression is characterized by negative patterns of information processing. One aspect is cognitive reactivity - the tendency to respond with maladaptive thoughts when mood is challenged. Vulnerable individuals also show negative cognitive biases in emotion perception and attention, and impaired decision-making. How one processes personal and socially relevant information {{plays an important role}} in the development and maintenance of depression. The first part of the thesis reports how the interplay between genes and environment affects cognitive reactivity and emotional information processing. We observed that genes and environmental stressors interact to determine a person’s vulnerability to depression or resilience. Cognitive reactivity was also found to be a <b>residual</b> <b>vulnerability</b> factor in individuals with history of suicidal tendencies. The second part of the thesis is comprised of two experimental manipulations on emotional cognition. Effects of omega- 3 fatty acid supplementation were examined on mood and cognition of healthy participants and recovered depressed individuals. Omega- 3 fatty acids can have selective effects on mood and cognition of individuals, but the pathways through which this happens remain to be investigated. Promotor: A. J.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We use signal {{detection}} theory to measure vulnerability to phishing attacks, including variation in performance across task conditions. BACKGROUND: Phishing attacks {{are difficult to}} prevent with technology alone, as long as technology is operated by people. Those responsible for managing security risks must understand user decision making {{in order to create}} and evaluate potential solutions. METHOD: Using a scenario-based online task, we performed two experiments comparing performance on two tasks: detection, deciding whether an e-mail is phishing, and behavior, deciding what to do with an e-mail. In Experiment 1, we manipulated the order of the tasks and notification of the phishing base rate. In Experiment 2, we varied which task participants performed. RESULTS: In both experiments, despite exhibiting cautious behavior, participants 2 ̆ 7 limited detection ability left them vulnerable to phishing attacks. Greater sensitivity was positively correlated with confidence. Greater willingness to treat e-mails as legitimate was negatively correlated with perceived consequences from their actions and positively correlated with confidence. These patterns were robust across experimental conditions. CONCLUSION: Phishing-related decisions are sensitive to individuals 2 ̆ 7 detection ability, response bias, confidence, and perception of consequences. Performance differs when people evaluate messages or respond to them but not when their task varies in other ways. APPLICATION: Based on these results, potential interventions include providing users with feedback on their abilities and information about the consequences of phishing, perhaps targeting those with the worst performance. Signal detection methods offer system operators quantitative assessments of the impacts of interventions and their <b>residual</b> <b>vulnerability...</b>|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of PhilosophyThis study {{examines}} {{the experience of}} inpatient mental health nurses who have been assaulted by their patients. The {{study was conducted in}} two phases in the inpatient units of a mental health service in regional New South Wales, Australia. Grounded theory method was used to analyse the data collected during Phase One in which the researcher conducted non-participant observation of three units. This enabled the researcher to explore the nurses’ working environment and develop a theory which explained the way in which inpatient mental health nurses interacted with their patients in the provision of care. Phase One findings provided contextual information which facilitated the understanding of subsequent data collected during Phase Two. Mixed methods were used during Phase Two of the study in which sixteen recently assaulted nurse were interviewed within three weeks of their assault and then on two subsequent occasions at three months and six months post-assault. None of the nurses experienced lasting physical trauma {{as a result of their}} assault however nine reported psychological effects lasting from several weeks to several months. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and grounded theory method. The main purpose of this study was to develop a substantive theory which explained the process of response and, by extension, recovery of the mental health nurses to the experience of assault by a patient. Data analysis during Phase One of the study revealed that the mental health nurses were constantly dealing with the problem of a chaotic work environment and a preoccupation with ensuring the smooth operation of the unit which was done in preference to the provision of therapeutic nursing care. The emergent core category of nurses responding to others in an ad hoc manner explained the tendency of the nurses to constantly deal with the needs of others rather than actively plan patient care. Data analysis during Phase Two of the study revealed that participants tended to use passive coping strategies in the aftermath of their assault by a patient. Whilst some participants were able to forget about their assault and get on with their lives, however, others who were more severely affected by their assault developed a coping pattern characterised by churning anxiety which featured assault reminders, passive coping strategies, assault response mediators (which referred to the availability of support from peers and nursing administrators) and a sense of futility related to the belief about the inevitability of workplace assault. The churning anxiety phase of recovery was followed by a later reintegration phase in which the participants adopted a more active coping style accompanied by a sense of <b>residual</b> <b>vulnerability</b> and ongoing futility. An important finding was that the participants reported that they were compromised in their ability to effectively engage with patients as they recovered from their assault. The basic social process emerging from the data for the severely affected assaulted nurses was labelled moving from passive to active coping strategies in the context of the nurses overcoming futility focused about the assault. The significance of this study is that the nurses who experienced more severe post-assault responses had a recovery that was completed in stages as they passed from the churning anxiety phase to the reintegration phase and this finding adds to the understanding of the complex phenomenon of recovery after assault. The finding also has occupational health and safety implications for employers as they assist mental health nurses to recover from the effects of patient assault. It is concluded that, with further research, interventions might be tailored to assist nurses in the recovery process depending upon their phase of recovery. This may enable assaulted nurses to decrease their distress and enable them to more effectively fulfil their professional role by engaging with their patients...|$|E

40|$|Many large {{software}} projects contain <b>residual</b> buffer-overrun <b>vulnerabilities</b> {{that somehow}} {{have managed to}} escape static analysis and source code reviews. We present an automated software-only technique to detect at run-time when such <b>residual</b> <b>vulnerabilities</b> are exploited, enabling us to stop attacks before they can cause damage. Our technique is based on generating several slightly different variants of the same software and running these variants simultaneously and in lock-step on different cores of a multiprocessor. The different variants are created {{in such a way}} that their behavior under “normal ” operation is the same for all variants, while it diverges when a buffer overrun occurs. We have implemented our technique by modifying the GNU compiler to generate variants and by constructing a layer above the OS kernel that monitors these variants. In particular, the two variants of a program that are executed in parallel in our prototype grow the stack in opposite directions, causing stack-smashing, arc injection, and related attacks to affect the two variants differently. Our system is able to stop actual exploit codes when executing unpatched variants of the popular Apache web server, yet incurs only moderate performance penalties on the order of 20 %. While our current implementation creates two parallel variants, our framework is scalable to higher levels of parallelism with even higher defensive thresholds. ...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{methodology}} that allows to automatically identify <b>residual</b> <b>vulnerabilities</b> of a Web application {{from the analysis}} of the targeted application, following a black box approach. The proposed approach can automatically identify and exploit vulnerabilities. It is also designed to highlight potential attack scenarios including the exploitation of several successive vulnerabilities that are not necessarily independent. The identification of these scenarios is based on the dynamic crawling of the application, resulting {{in the creation of a}} navigation graph that describes the different possibilities for a user to activate the application and associated vulnerabilities. This graph explicitly represents the dependencies between the vulnerabilities of the site and thereafter various attack scenarios. To validate our approach, we developed a new vulnerability scanner that has been validated on different vulnerable applications and compared experimentally with other existing vulnerability scanners.|$|R

Deploying sensors to monitor attacks exploiting <b>residual</b> <b>vulnerabilities</b> is not sufficient and new tools are needed to assess the risk associated with the security events produced by these sensors.

In this paper, we present the Hybrid Risk Assessment Model (HRAM), a Bayesian network-based extension to topological attack graphs, capable of handling topological cycles, making it fit for any information system. This hybrid model is subdivided in two complementary models: (1) Dynamic Risk Correlation Models, correlating a chain of alerts with the knowledge on the system to analyse ongoing attacks and provide the hosts' compromise probabilities, and (2) Future Risk Assessment Models, taking into account existing vulnerabilities and current attack status to assess the most likely future attacks. We validate the performance and accuracy of this model on simulated network topologies and against diverse attack scenarios of realistic size...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{describes a}} threat {{model for the}} context in which External Border Gateway Protocol (EBGP) path security mechanisms will be developed. The threat model includes an analysis of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) and focuses on the ability of an Autonomous System (AS) to verify the authenticity of the AS path info received in a BGP update. We use the term "PATHSEC " to refer to any BGP path security technology that makes use of the RPKI. PATHSEC will secure BGP, consistent with the inter-AS security focus of the RPKI. The document characterizes classes of potential adversaries that are considered to be threats and examines classes of attacks that might be launched against PATHSEC. It does not revisit attacks against unprotected BGP, as that topic has already been addressed in the BGP- 4 standard. It concludes with a brief discussion of <b>residual</b> <b>vulnerabilities.</b> Status of This Memo This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.

40|$|The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is {{the most}} {{important}} protocol for the interconnectivity of the Internet. Although it has shown acceptable performance, there are many issues about its capability to meet the scale of the growth of the Internet, mainly because of the security issues that surround interdomain routing. The Internet is important to many organisations in various contexts. Thus, it is required to provide a highly secure protocol to keep the normal operation of the Internet. BGP suffers from many security issues. In this dissertation, we cover those issues and provide the security requirements for this protocol. We enumerate the numerous attacks that can be conducted against BGP. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine two considerably discussed protocols. Secure-BGP (S-BGP) and secure origin BGP (soBGP) have shown a revolutionary view on interdomain routing since they endeavour to providing security mechanisms at the protocol level. The objective is extended to comparing these two solutions by examining their contribution to the Border Gateway Protocol in terms of security. Moreover, we study their interoperability, efficiency, performance, and the <b>residual</b> <b>vulnerabilities</b> that each solution failed to resolve. Our findings have revealed that ultimately, the solution chosen will be dependent on the desired level of security and deployability. As is often the case with security, a compromise between security and feasibility is of a major concern and cost-effectiveness is the main driver behind deployment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Multipath TCP (MPTCP) {{is a new}} {{protocol}} {{being developed}} in the IETF’s MPTCP working group {{in order to provide}} higher communication availability and to improve the throughput between two multi-addressed endpoints by using multiple paths. Due to the multipath nature and specifically its path management, some new security threats arise apart from those that are already present in standard single-path TCP. These new attacks include flooding and hijacking attacks performed by an off-path attacker. In this paper, we explore different solutions in order to cover the identified security flaws. The main proposal is based on hash chains, which significantly reduces the initial set of threats resulting in a <b>residual</b> group of <b>vulnerabilities,</b> which are also identified...|$|R
40|$|The most {{prevalent}} group A rotavirus {{found in the}} diarrheic children was also determined in drinking water sources including raw water, treated water and tap water in Beijing, and then the possible contamination contributions to tap water for human consumption were discussed in this study. A total of 26 raw water samples, 77 treated water samples and 143 tap water samples in Beijing were collected for analysis of group A rotavirus from April 2006 to August 2007. According to the results, it was shown that group A rotaviruses occurred in 9 raw water samples (34. 6 %), 9 treated water samples (11. 7 %) and 32 tap water samples (22. 4 %) during the sampling period, and low disinfectant <b>residuals</b> or a <b>vulnerability</b> of the distribution system to pressure transients, in addition to raw water, {{may account for the}} group A rotaviruses contamination to tap water. The rotavirus contamination observed in this study may highlight a potential public health risk and illustrate the importance of including routine virological analysis of drinking water supplies during winter time in Beijing...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe need {{to adapt}} to {{decrease}} farm vulnerability to adverse contextual events has been extensively discussed on a theoretical basis. We developed an integrated and operational method to assess farm vulnerability to multiple and interacting contextual changes and explain how this vulnerability can best be reduced according to farm configurations and farmers' technical adaptations over time. Our method considers farm vulnerability {{as a function of}} the raw measurements of vulnerability variables (e. g., economic efficiency of production), the slope of the linear regression of these measurements over time, and the residuals of this linear regression. The last two are extracted from linear mixed models considering a random regression coefficient (an intercept common to all farms), a global trend (a slope common to all farms), a random deviation from the general mean for each farm, and a random deviation from the general trend for each farm. Among all possible combinations, the lowest farm vulnerability is obtained through a combination of high values of measurements, a stable or increasing trend and low variability for all vulnerability variables considered. Our method enables relating the measurements, trends and <b>residuals</b> of <b>vulnerability</b> variables to explanatory variables that illustrate farm exposure to climatic and economic variability, initial farm configurations and farmers' technical adaptations over time. We applied our method to 19 cattle (beef, dairy, and mixed) farms over the period 20082013. Selected vulnerability variables, i. e., farm productivity and economic efficiency, varied greatly among cattle farms and across years, with means ranging from 43. 0 to 270. 0 kg protein/ha and 29. 4 - 66. 0 % efficiency, respectively. No farm had a high level, stable or increasing trend and low residuals for both farm productivity and economic efficiency of production. Thus, the least vulnerable farms represented a compromise among measurement value, trend, and variability of both performances. No specific combination of farmers' practices emerged for reducing cattle farm vulnerability to climatic and economic variability. In the least vulnerable farms, the practices implemented (stocking rate, input use [...] .) were more consistent with the objective of developing the properties targeted (efficiency, robustness [...] .). Our method can be used to support farmers with sector-specific and local insights about most promising farm adaptations...|$|R
