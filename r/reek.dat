[...] Aeschylus' phrase [...] "the <b>reek</b> of human blood smiles out at me" [...] in particular haunted Bacon, and his treatments of the mouth in the triptych and many subsequent paintings were attempts to visualise the sentiment.

50|$|The River Laune, flows {{approximately}} 20 km {{to drain}} Killarney’s Lough Leane {{into the sea}} at Castlemaine Harbour. The Laune carries most of the rainfall from the MacGillycuddy <b>Reeks,</b> Ireland’s highest mountain range. Many streams {{on the south side}} of the <b>Reeks</b> drain into Killarney’s Upper Lake before filtering down to Lough Leane. As the River Laune drains Lough Leane to the sea, it is fed by two rivers running north from the <b>Reeks,</b> the River Loe from the Gap of Dunloe and the Gaddagh River from the heart of the <b>Reeks.</b> Another tributary, the Cottoners River, carries rainwater from the west of the <b>Reeks.</b> On the southern side of the bridge, a low embankment runs upstream for about 1 km towards Killarney. This is part of over 40 km of embankments that prevent the sea from flooding low-lying land around Castlemaine Harbour. These embankments exist due to Napoleon’s dominance in Europe around the year 1808. The British government were looking for alternative sources of hemp to make sailcloth for their navy to defend against a possible invasion.|$|R

500|$|A {{characteristic}} of some grindcore songs is the [...] "microsong," [...] lasting {{only a few}} seconds.

[...] David Keenan of The Wire attributed Axelrod's sampling legacy with producers such as DJ Premier and DJ Shadow to Palmer, [...] "the original badass drummer [...] played {{on all of these}} tracks". He facetiously critiqued that the album's songs [...] "may <b>reek</b> of stale joss sticks and patchouli-scented self-actualisation, but in their very datedness they somehow sound very modern." [...] Pitchfork journalist Sean Fennessey felt Axelrod's first two records were [...] "essential if only as a tour guide through early 90s hip-hop", having [...] "literally been a rap producer's delight for years".

[...] Christopher Muther of The Boston Globe wrote that [...] " [...] take on Jamaican music {{has the potential to}} <b>reek</b> of day-old Ace of Bass", but called it [...] "surprisingly solid". Noel Gardner of Drowned in Sound called it [...] "frankly peculiar", and wrote, [...] "It’s evidently laced with irony, and is possibly the most fun tune on here". Luke Lewis of NME wrote a mixed review of the song, stating, [...] "It feels less authentic, especially on ‘Dancefloor Queen’, a misfiring collaboration with Diplo that features the least convincing patois this side of a George Lamb radio show." ...|$|E

500|$|Napalm Death's seismic impact {{inspired}} other British grindcore {{groups in}} the 1980s, among them Extreme Noise Terror, Carcass and Sore Throat. Extreme Noise Terror, from Ipswich, formed in 1984. With the goal of becoming [...] "the most extreme hardcore punk band of all time," [...] the group took Mick Harris from Napalm Death in 1987. Ian Glasper describes the group as [...] "pissed-off hateful noise with its roots somewhere between early Discharge and Disorder, with [...] Dean [...] and Phil [...] pushing their trademark vocal extremity to its absolute limit." [...] In 1991, the group collaborated with the acid house group The KLF, appearing onstage with the group at the Brit Awards in 1992. Carcass released <b>Reek</b> of Putrefaction in 1988, which John Peel declared his favorite {{album of the year}} despite its very poor production. The band's focus on gore and anatomical decay, lyrically and in sleeve artwork, inspired the goregrind subgenre. Sore Throat, said by Ian Glasper to have taken [...] "perhaps the most uncompromisingly anti-music stance" [...] were inspired by crust punk as well as industrial music. Some listeners, such as Digby Pearson, considered them to be simply an in-joke or parody of grindcore.|$|E

500|$|In {{spite of}} noting that Diplo makes Madonna sound fun on the song, Gavin Haynes of NME {{commented that the}} song's {{composition}} [...] "showed the gulf between [...] life and her music is now impossible to ignore". Calling it [...] "awry", Alexis Petridis of The Guardian claimed that [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna" [...] is [...] "a fantastic title {{in search of a}} song. In lieu of one, producer Diplo comes up with a kind of hybrid of EDM and happy hardcore and throws Nicki Minaj at her most hyperactive into the mix; the result genuinely sets your teeth on edge." [...] Criticizing Rebel Heart for being [...] "overworked", Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine found that [...] "the duality of its title [...] muddled by the inclusion of garish party jams like the infuriatingly catchy but lyrically cringe-inducing 'Bitch I'm Madonna'". John Murphy of musicOMH remarked that the song [...] "never quite lives up to its fantastic title, and just sounds a bit of a mess, trying to cram in Diplo-produced dance-hall rhythms, a dubstep breakdown and the seemingly now obligatory Nicki Minaj guest rap". Evan Sawdey of PopMatters opined that the song—and another Rebel Heart track, [...] "Illuminati"—"absolutely <b>reek</b> of desperation, wanting so badly to shock and offend listeners that they fail to resolve as satisfying songs first and foremost".|$|E
500|$|On March 15, 2012, Rihanna {{explained}} her {{collaboration with}} Brown to Ryan Seacrest during his morning show: [...] "The first song that came about was 'Birthday Cake'. I mean, {{we ended up}} recording {{them at the same}} time and executing them together. But I reached out to him about doing 'Birthday Cake' because that’s the only person that, really, it made sense to do the record. Just as a musician, despite everything else, that was going to be the person. You know I thought about rappers, and I’ve done that so many times, and the hottest R artist out right now is Chris Brown. So I wanted him on the track, and then in turn he was like, ‘Why don’t you do the remix to my track?’ and it was a trade-off. We did two records. One for my fans, one for his fans, and that way our fans can come together. There shouldn’t be a divide. You know? It’s music, and it’s innocent." [...] In March 2012, American rapper Fabolous released his own verse to the [...] "Birthday Cake" [...] remix. The following month, Rick Ross also released the track featuring an added rap verse from himself, along with the previously incorporated Chris Brown verses. Busta Rhymes released his own freestyle to the song along with rapper <b>Reek</b> da Villian.|$|E
500|$|Greatest Hits: My Prerogative {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. Mary Awosika of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune selected [...] "(I've Just Begun) Having My Fun" [...] {{as the best}} of the new tracks, and added that [...] "The rest of the album is a romp down memory lane of when Spears was the 'It' girl of popular culture, ruling the pop charts as a multi-million dollar entertainment should. [...] In all honesty, no one can deny Spears has recorded some great dance songs, and this album {{is the best way to}} get all the songs in one swoop". Faridul Anwar Farinordin of the New Straits Times said, [...] "rest assured, fans will surely grab this one" [...] and selected [...] "Oops!...

Annabel Leathes of BBC Online deemed it [...] "calorific as the KFC burgers dished up at her chav-style wedding; twenty finger lickin' tracks that mirror her trajectory from pretty pop puff to lusty strumpet". Christy Lemire of the Associated Press stated that it was premature for Spears to release a greatest hits album compilation after only five years, but highlighted [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U", [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "Everytime".
