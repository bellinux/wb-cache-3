60|$|He was {{a little}} black-gaitered object in a scene of the most {{exquisite}} and delicate colour. Right and left of him stretched the low grey salted shore, pale banks of marly earth surmounted by green-grey wiry grass that held and was half buried in fine blown sand. Above, the heavens made a complete hemisphere of blue in which a series of remote cumulus clouds floated and dissolved. Before him spread the long levels of the sands, and far away at its utmost ebb was the sea. Eleanor had gone to explore the black ribs of a wrecked fishing-boat that lay {{at the edge of}} a shallow lagoon. She {{was a little}} pink-footed figure, very bright and apparently transparent. She had reverted for a time to shameless childishness; she had hidden her stockings among the reeds of the bank, and she was running to and fro, from star-fish to <b>razor</b> <b>shell</b> and from cockle to weed. The shingle was pale drab and purple close at hand, but to the westward, towards Hunstanton, the sands became brown and purple, and were presently broken up into endless skerries of low flat weed-covered boulders and little intensely blue pools. The sea was a band of sapphire that became silver to the west; it met the silver shining sands in one delicate breathing edge of intensely white foam. Remote to the west, very small and black and clear against the afternoon sky, was a cart, and about it was a score or so of mussel-gatherers. A little nearer, on an apparently empty stretch of shining wet sand, a multitude of gulls was mysteriously busy. These two groups of activities and Eleanor's flitting translucent movements did but set off and emphasize the immense and soothing tranquillity.|$|E

50|$|<b>Razor</b> <b>shells</b> have {{a fragile}} shell, with open ends. The shell is smooth {{on the outside}} and whitish in color, with {{vertical}} and horizontal reddish-brown or purplish-brown markings separated by a diagonal line. The periostracum is olive-green.

50|$|Phaxas pellucidus or the {{transparent}} <b>razor</b> <b>shell</b> is {{a species of}} marine bivalve mollusc in the family Pharidae. It is found buried in the seabed in coastal waters of northwest Europe, often in great numbers.|$|E
50|$|The <b>razor</b> <b>shell</b> lives {{under the}} sand, using its {{powerful}} foot to dig {{to a safe}} depth. Its digging activity comprises six stages, repeated cyclically. A digging cycle involves integration of the muscular foot (which takes up {{a large part of}} the body) with the opening and closing of the valve and one end. The foot is inflated hydraulically, extending down into the sand and anchoring the animal. Deflation of the foot then draws the shell down. The <b>razor</b> <b>shell</b> also squirts water down into the sand, removing loose sand from its path. The foot is thought to exert a pressure of about 196kPa (2 kgf/cm2).|$|E
50|$|In the <b>razor</b> <b>shell</b> sexual {{development}} is highly synchronous. During the summer, {{they are in}} the sexual rest stage, and gametogenesis begins at the start of autumn. In winter and spring consecutive spawns take place, interrupted by gonadal restoration periods.|$|E

500|$|<b>Razor</b> <b>shells</b> can dig {{themselves}} into the sand with great speed to escape predation. When a Pacific razor clam (Siliqua patula) is laid {{on the surface of}} the beach it can bury itself completely in seven seconds [...] and the Atlantic jackknife clam, Ensis directus, can do the same within fifteen seconds. Scallops and file clams can swim by opening and closing their valves rapidly; water is ejected on either side of the hinge area and they move with the flapping valves in front. Scallops have simple eyes around the margin of the mantle and can clap their valves shut to move sharply, hinge first, to escape from danger. Cockles can use their foot to move across the seabed or leap away from threats. The foot is first extended before being contracted suddenly when it acts like a spring, projecting the animal forwards.|$|R

40|$|We {{analysed}} {{the fishing}} fleet dynamics in the CÃ­es Islands, {{located in a}} National Land-Marine Park of Galicia. By interviewing fishers we identified the fleet fishing {{in the study area}} and obtained temporal data on effort and catch. Then we performed multivariate analyses of the catch profiles to identify the fishing strategies and their temporal dynamics. Our results highlight the complexity of the fishery system, composed of 565 boats that used 19 fishing gears and 33 strategies in an area of 26. 6 km 2. Octopus and velvet crab pots, gillnets targeting hake, trammel nets targeting European spider crab or ballan wrasse, clam rakes, and hand harvesting of gooseneck barnacles and <b>razor</b> <b>shells</b> are the strategies most used. In addition, most of the boats are generalists and use up to seven different fishing strategies throughout the year. This flexibility of the fleet to change the target species generates a wide diversity of annual fishing patterns that increases the complexity of the fisheries and the difficulty of managing them. The implementation of data collection programmes that include fleet dynamics and spatial data are key factors for developing effective management regulations consistent with the complexity of the system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract] Ensis Schumacher, 1817 <b>razor</b> <b>shells</b> {{occur at}} {{both sides of}} the Atlantic and along the Pacific coasts of {{tropical}} west America, Peru, and Chile. Many of them are marketed in various regions. However, the absence of clear autapomorphies in the shell and the sympatric distributions of some species often prevent a correct identification of specimens. As a consequence, populations cannot be properly managed, and edible species are almost always mislabelled along the production chain. In this work, we studied whether the currently accepted Atlantic Ensis morphospecies are different evolutionary lineages, to clarify their taxonomic status and enable molecular identifications through DNA barcoding. For this, we studied 109 specimens sampled at 27 sites, which were identified as belonging to nine of those morphospecies. We analysed nucleotide variation at four nuclear (18 S, 5. 8 S, ITS 1, and ITS 2) and two mitochondrial (COI and 16 S) regions, although the 18 S and 5. 8 S regions were not informative at the species level and were not further considered. The phylogenetic trees and networks obtained supported all morphospecies as separately evolving lineages. Phylogenetic trees recovered Ensis at each side of the Atlantic as reciprocally monophyletic. Remarkably, we confirm the co-occurrence of the morphologically similar E. minor (Chenu, 1843) and E. siliqua (Linné, 1758) along the NW Iberian coast, a fact that has been often overlooked. In South America, a relevant divergence between E. macha (Molina, 1792) individuals from Chile and Argentina was unveiled and suggests incipient speciation. We also confirm the occurrence of the North American species E. directus (Conrad, 1843) as far south as north-eastern Florida. Among the genomic regions analysed, we suggest COI as the most suitable DNA barcode for Atlantic Ensis. Our results will contribute to the conservation and management of Ensis populations and will enable reliable identifications of the edible species, {{even in the absence of}} the valves. The name Ensis coseli Vierna nom. nov. is proposed to replace E. minor Dall, 1899 non (Chenu, 1843) ...|$|R
40|$|Small-scale {{fisheries}} {{are characterized}} by a high diversification of fishing strategies and a highly dynamic pattern of their use {{in time and space}} that complicate data collection and management. Ignoring this variability can produce an incomplete image of the fisheries dynamics and thus can lead to the implementation of inappropriate regulations. In the present study we analyzed the fishing dynamics of the small-scale fleet operating around the Cíes Islands, situated in the marine National Park of Illas Atlánticas (Galicia, NW Spain). In spite of this protection figure created in 2002, no spatially-explicit information on the fishing system in the area is currently available and no specific management is applied. Fishery information systems in Galicia are related only to the landing ports, and the spatial aspects of the fishing operations are not available despite their importance for assessment and management. We carried out interviews with the fishers to first identify the fleet from nearby base ports operating in the Cíes Islands, and then to obtain temporal patterns of effort and catch data. A series of hierarchical cluster analyses of the individual monthly catch profiles was performed to identify the fishing strategies and to study their temporal dynamics. The Cíes fleet was composed of 565 boats coming from 11 ports of the South of Galicia. Although purse seine vessels were present in the park, the fishing effort was mainly exerted by the artisanal segment (vessels less than 12 m long using mobile and passive gears) because it was the largest sector in terms of number of boats. We identified 19 active and passive fishing gears operating in the Cíes Islands. Eight of them were selective gears (traps, clam rakes, and manual harvesting) which were specialized in capturing a single target species. In contrast, the remaining gears were multispecies (trammel nets, purse seine nets, gillnets, longlines, trawl) with a different catch species composition depending on the season, mesh size and the fishing zone. Thus, we identified up to 7 fishing strategies practiced with the same gear and aimed to catch different target species. In total 33 fishing strategies operating in Cíes Islands were described, being the most used ones: pots targeting common octopus and velvet crab; gillnet targeting hake and pouting; trammel net targeting either European spider crab or Ballan wrasse; clam rakes; and manual harvesting for goose-barnacles and <b>razor</b> <b>shells.</b> The main season in which each fishing strategy was used changed according to the fishing policy (e. g. closed seasons for target species or fishing gears), the fish prices, and the temporal variation in the abundance of target species...|$|R
50|$|P. pellucidus is a {{very small}} <b>razor</b> <b>shell</b> seldom {{exceeding}} 4 cm in length. The colour is cream or dull white, sometimes with reddish markings. The periostracum is olive-coloured and glossy. The two elongated valves are fragile and equal in size. The dorsal side of each is straight while the ventral side is slightly curved giving a pod-like appearance. The anterior end is rounded while the posterior end is slightly truncate. There are fine sculptured lines parallel to the margins, which are themselves smooth. The ligament joining the valves is external and located close to the beaks which are very close to the anterior end. Pharus legumen is a somewhat similar species but it can be distinguished by its larger size and more cylindrical outline and the differences in the hinge teeth.|$|E
50|$|Shellfish of {{all sorts}} {{are part of the}} diet, and {{shellfish}} of the coastal regions include little neck clams, sea scallops, blue mussels, oysters, soft shell clams and <b>razor</b> <b>shell</b> clams. Much of this shellfish contributes to New England tradition, the clambake. The clambake as known today is a colonial interpretation of an American Indian tradition. In summer, oysters and clams are dipped in batter and fried, often served in a basket with french fries, or commonly on a wheaten bun as a clam roll. Oysters are otherwise eaten chilled on a bed of crushed ice on the half shell with mignonette sauce, and are often branded on where they were harvested. Large quahogs are stuffed with breadcrumbs and seasoning and baked in their shells, and smaller ones often find their way into clam chowder. Other preparations include clams casino, clams on the half shell served stuffed with herbs like oregano and streaky bacon.|$|E
40|$|Management of {{shellfish}} resources {{requires a}} spatial approach where mapping {{is a key}} tool. Acoustic techniques have been rarely used to map infaunal organisms with a patchy distribution. We propose and test the use of split-beam echosounder angular information to assess <b>razor</b> <b>shell</b> presence and relative density. Our statistical approach combines textural analysis of angular echograms, standard unsupervised multivariate methods and hierarchical classification through dendrograms to identify groups of locations with similar clam densities. The statistical analyses show that the classification is consistent with groundtruthing data and that results are insensitive to boat motion or seabed granulometry. The method developed here constitutes a promising tool for assessing the relative density of razor clam grounds. ...|$|E
6000|$|Instantly all was confusion. The infant, {{his mother}} and the other non- combatants of the tribe, were bundled into canoes and paddled, through a tempestuous sea, {{to the site of}} the modern Bordighiera.

Good manners, of course, forbade the cave people to resist this visit, but etiquette permitted (and in New Caledonia still permits) the group to bury and hide its portable possessions. Canoes had been brought into the little creek beneath the cave, to convey the women and children into a safe retreat, and the men were just beginning to hide the spears, bone daggers, flint fish-hooks, mats, <b>shell</b> <b>razors,</b> nets, and so forth, when Why-Why gave an early proof of his precocity by entering the world some time before his arrival was expected.|$|R
40|$|A {{longline}} 'metier' using small hooks for 'red' sea breams (Pagellus acarne and Pagellus erythrinus) in the Algarve (south of Portugal) was studied. Experimental longlining {{was carried}} out with three sizes of "Mustad" round bend, flatted, spade end Quality 2316 DT hooks (numbers 11, 13 and 15) and two types of bait: <b>razor</b> <b>shell</b> (Ensis siliqua) and mud shrimp (Upogebia pusilla). A total of 3 328 fish and at least 36 species were caught with 33 600 hooks fished in 28 longline sets. Five species of sea breams (Sparidae) accounted for 79 % of the catch: Pagellus acarne, Pagellus erythrinus, Diplodus vulgaris, Spondyliosoma cantharus, and Boops boops. High catch rates of 20 - 30 fish per 100 hooks were made {{in a number of}} 1 200 hook longline sets, with total catch weights of 40 to more than 60 kg per set. In general, the smallest hook (number 15) had the highest catch rate. Bait type did not significantly affect the catch size distributions. Although more fish were caught with the <b>razor</b> <b>shell</b> bait, higher catch rates of 'red' sea breams were obtained with mud shrimp. Catch rates were also affected by the location of the fishing grounds and the time of the set, with the highest catch rates obtained when the longline was set within two hours before sunrise. A wide size range was caught for each species, with highly overlapped catch size frequency distributions for the three hook sizes used. Except for Spondyliosoma cantharus, few illegal-sized fish were caught, even with the smallest hook. The logistic model fitted by maximum likelihood was used to describe hook selectivity for Diplodus vulgaris, Pagellus acarne, Pagellus erythrinus, and Spondyliosoma cantharus.
