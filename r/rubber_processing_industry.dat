40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Stearates are commonly used in polymer technology as slip additives and lubricants. The release properties of stearic acid and its metallic derivatives are extensively manipulated in <b>rubber</b> <b>processing</b> <b>industries</b> where they are used as mold release agents. Previous unrelated {{studies have shown that}} increased additions of stearic acid consistently reduced mold sticking. Despite their widespread usage, however, few studies have been directed to study their mechanism of action. In a preliminary study conducted by AWE and Loughborough University, the attainment of low levels of adhesion was studied and in particular the use of stearic acid as an adhesion modifier was studied. It was found that adding minute amounts of stearic acid resulted in dramatic reductions to the strength of aluminium bonded with a PDMS-based adhesive. The cause of this fall-off in adhesion (as measured by T-peel test) was initially attributed to the migration of stearic acid to the surface forming a weak boundary layer. The possibility that stearic acid acts as an inhibitor for the cure reaction was also considered. Surface analysis predominantly with static secondary ion mass spectrometry (SSIMS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out to ascertain locus of failure and the likelihood of stearic acid at the interface. Failure was identified as having taken place in a cohesive, and potentially interphasial, layer near the interface of the joint. No evidence was given to support the WBL theory proposed by most researchers, thus findings from the present study contradicted existing literature.

40|$|Abstract The {{introduction}} of {{best environmental practices}} (in this study it implies adoption of cleaner technology in varying degrees) among industrial enterprises in Cameroon remains a serious challenge to environmental policy makers. Whilst {{research has shown that}} the rubber industry can {{play an important role in}} strengthening a nation’s economic development; its negative environmental impacts, due to poor effluent treatments and the lack of research to generate more knowledge on opportunities and usefulness offered by better management practices, remain a serious concern. The seldom improvements to <b>rubber</b> <b>processing</b> and effluent management take place off farm and are more likely to occur when they are regulated by environmental laws. In so doing enterprises are instead reactive (i. e they are less active in engaging themselves into learning processes within their network to build technical competencies, which are prerequisites to receive, interprete and use environmental information) and try to comply with environmental regulation at the lowest possible level. In reality, effluents from primary <b>rubber</b> <b>processing</b> are not a problem when standard end-of-pipe treatments are installed. However the study indicates that such treatment plants are uncommon in any of the Cameroon’s primary <b>rubber</b> <b>processing</b> <b>industries.</b> A case study exploring the potentials of adopting cleaner technologies to address industrial pollution arising from natural <b>rubber</b> <b>processing</b> in the CDC revealed great opportunities and constraints towards improvement of rubber-based factory environmental performance. These findings indicate that environmental policies (only grounded on environmental demands with less consideration of the company’s business view) aimed at ecological industrial transformation need to be supplemented with more innovative instruments embedded in what is referred today as “second generation” regulation. It suggests that policy makers, actors and institutions of the Cameroon Government will continue to intervene in the arena of environmental issues indeed, but selectively and in interaction with a range of other non-market and market sources of pressure. The claim here is that such network relations can better facilitate learning and knowledge accumulation, which are needed to strengthen the dynamic of interactions between actors and institutions embedded in a particular Enterprise’s network (a sort of complex system of interactions between suppliers, producers, consumers, regulators, learning centres and financial institutions to bring about environmental innovation within a corporation). In fact, the examination of these interactions gives sufficient insight to understand what can actually determine the CDC’s capability to carry out and participate in successful environmental innovation processes. Despite the challenges of implementation of Ecological Modernization concepts in Cameroon, great opportunities may exist for its deployment in understanding environment-informed ecological restructuring of industrial systems. The result of all this is that there is a lot of very concrete projects - in the sense of win-win perspective as it is emphasized by Ecological Modernization - that will be possible to make functioning in the <b>processing</b> of natural <b>rubber</b> and that can provide valuable asset for environmental technology market. These projects are all about resources optimization in converting natural rubber into industrial grade products (on and off farm processing) and they include: (i) biogas generation plant and energy recovery; (ii) sludge treatment and reuse either for soil amendment or as fertilizer for farmland; (iii) wastewater recovery techniques through irrigation etc. To this end it appears that the only demand would be the availability of some kind of technical competencies to implement the said facilities in order to improve the environmental performance of the CDC and Cameroon industrial web as a whole.

The natural rubber-compounding was pre-heated by microwave radiation using a rectangular wave guide system (MODE: TE 10) operating at frequency of 2. 45 GHz in which the power can vary from 0 to 1500 W. In the present work, the influence of power input, sample thickness, and sulphur content were examined after applying microwave radiation to the rubber samples. Results are discussed regarding the thermal properties, 3 -D network, dielectric properties and chemical structures. From the result, firstly, {{it was found that}} microwave radiation can be applied to pre-heating natural rubber-compounding before the vulcanization process. Secondly, microwave radiation was very useful for pre-heating natural rubber-compounding that has a thickness greater than 5 mm. Thirdly, crosslinking in natural rubber-compounding may occurs after pre-heating by microwave radiation though Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy(FTIR). Finally, there a little effect of sulphur content on temperature profiles after applying microwave radiation to the natural rubber-compounding. Moreover, natural rubber-compounding without carbon black showed a lower heat absorption compared with natural rubbercompounding filled carbon black. This is due to the difference in dielectric loss factor.

To achieve the desired material properties in the respective end product, both producers of technical rubber products and tire makers {{are in need of}} a mixing process that is effective (in terms of both dispersion and distributive mixing efficiency). Major differences in polarity between nonpolar rubber and highly polar silica impede the incorporation and dispersion of silica, the active filler. This effect also influences the quality of distributive mixing of other compound ingredients and thus the compound homogeneity that is to be attained. Whereas the reflected-light microscopy method, with image processing, has been tested and fully developed for industrial grade use in analyzing filler particle macrodispersion, employment of Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) remains relatively unknown in rubber processing as a means of analyzing distributive mixing efficiency via determination of the homogeneous distribution of a specific marker across a batch volume. The results of this research activity have shown that under atmospheric conditions (with no vacuum), LIBS is a suitable method for analyzing the distributive mixing quality of components within a rubber compound batch. The method can be applied both in compounds free of carbon black fillers and in those containing carbon black fillers. Thanks to its very short measurement time (here: approx. 40 s for analysis of a roughly postage-stamp-sized specimen surface), it yields a statistically representative statement as to the distributive quality of a marker (like zinc) in the used compound...|$|E

Subjects and Methods: Of 371 employees (197 men and 174 women) from a rubber factory in Guangzhou, 281 were <b>rubber</b> <b>processing</b> workers from five production sections and 90 were managerial workers. Information on occupational exposure, smoking, and drinking was collected by interviews. Blood samples were taken in the morning by venipuncture. DNA damages were measured by the Comet assay. Possible DNA-protein crosslinks were broken down by proteinase K. Tail moment, measured by Komet 4. 0 image analysis software, was the measure of DNA damage. Results: The <b>rubber</b> <b>processing</b> workers had larger tail moment than the managerial workers (Geometric mean, 95 %CI) [1. 77 μm (1. 64 - 1. 90) versus 1. 52 μm (1. 36 - 1. 71), P = 0. 04]. Both smoking [1. 93 μm (1. 74 - 2. 13) versus 1. 59 μm (1. 47 - 1. 71), P = 0. 003] and alcohol drinking [2. 21 μm (1. 87 - 2. 62) versus 1. 63 μm (1. 53 - 1. 74), P < 0. 001] increased tail moment. Tail moment differed significantly among job categories (F = 3. 21, P = 0. 008), the largest was observed in mixers. In the non-smoking and non- drinking workers, <b>rubber</b> <b>processing</b> workers had larger tail moment than managerial workers after adjusting for age (P = 0. 033).
