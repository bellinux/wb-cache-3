40|$|Two {{cases of}} {{pediatric}} patients with heart failure are presented. One child presented with vomiting {{and the other}} a child with a history of asthma who had respiratory distress. Though their presenting complaints are common, the diagnosis was made based on careful examination and consideration of abnormal findings.

60|$|The horse dashed on. He <b>galloped</b> <b>right</b> {{through the}} fire, {{for which he}} had run in his terror, fortunately, however, without {{treading}} on us, and vanished into the night. We heard his hoofs for a hundred yards or more, then there was silence, broken now and again by distant growls. As may be imagined, we did not sleep any more that night, but waited anxiously till the dawn broke, two hours later.|$|R
60|$|The buffaloes, or, more {{correctly}} speaking, the bisons {{which young}} Marston's sharp eye had discovered, were still so far-distant that they appeared like crows or little black specks against the sky. In order to approach them {{as near as}} possible without attracting their attention, it was necessary that the two horsemen should make a wide circuit, so as to get well to leeward, lest the wind should carry the scent {{of them to the}} herd. Their horses, being fleet, strong, and fresh, soon carried them to the proper direction, when they wheeled to the <b>right,</b> and <b>galloped</b> straight down upon their quarry, without any further attempt at concealment. The formation of the ground favoured their approach, so that they were within a mile of the herd before being discovered.|$|R
60|$|All carried two {{or three}} {{javelins}} in the left hand and a spear some ten feet long in the <b>right.</b> Horsemen <b>galloped</b> about at full speed {{to and from the}} royal palace, while occasionally chariots, drawn sometimes by one, sometimes by two horses, dashed along. These chariots were small, the wheels not exceeding three feet in height. Between them was placed the body of the vehicle, which was but just large enough for two men to stand on. It consisted only of a small platform, with a semicircular rail running round the front some eighteen inches above it. A close observer would have perceived at once that not only were the males of the city upon the point of marching out on a military expedition, but that it was no mere foray against a neighboring people, but a war on which the safety of the city depended.|$|R
50|$|The {{emblem of}} India is an {{adaptation}} of the Lion Capital of Ashoka at Sarnath. The Emblem constitutes of three lions, the fourth being hidden from view. The Ashoka Chakra (wheel) appears in relief {{in the center of}} the abacus, with a bull on the <b>right</b> and a <b>galloping</b> horse on the left, and outlines of Dharma Chakras on the extreme right and left. Forming an integral part of the emblem is the motto inscribed below the abacus in Devanagari script: Satyameva jayate सत्यमेव जयते (Truth Alone Triumphs). This is a quote from Mundaka Upanishad, the concluding part of the sacred Hindu Vedas. This National Emblem was adopted on 26 January 1950, the day that India became a republic.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{he heard}} a shout and the {{tramping}} of horse. The sides of the loft were scantily boarded to allow {{the extension of the}} pent-up grain, and between the interstices Ford, without being himself seen, had an uninterrupted view of the plain between him and the line of willows. As he gazed, five men hurriedly issued from the extreme left and ran towards the barn. McKinstry and his followers simultaneously broke from the same covert further to the <b>right</b> and <b>galloped</b> forward to intercept them. But although mounted, the greater distance they had to traverse brought them {{to the rear of the}} building only as the Harrison party came to a sudden halt before the closed and barricaded doors of the usually defenceless barn. The discomfiture of the latter was greeted by a derisive shout from the McKinstry party--albeit, equally astonished. But in that brief moment Ford recognized in the leader of the Harrisons the well-known figure of the Sheriff of Tuolumne. It needed only this to cap the climax of the fatality that seemed to pursue him. He was no longer a lawless opposer of equally lawless forces, but he was actually resisting the law itself. He understood the situation now. It was some idiotic blunder of Uncle Ben's that had precipitated this attack.|$|R
60|$|The Dervish line, {{broken by}} the charge, began to re-form at once. They closed up, shook {{themselves}} together, and prepared with constancy and courage for another shock. But on military considerations it was desirable to turn {{them out of the}} khor first and thus deprive them of their vantage ground. The regiment again drawn up, three squadrons in line and the fourth in column, now wheeled to the <b>right,</b> and, <b>galloping</b> round the Dervish flank, dismounted and opened a heavy fire with their magazine carbines. Under the pressure of this fire the enemy changed front to meet the new attack, so that both sides were formed at right angles to their original lines. When the Dervish change of front was completed, they began to advance against the dismounted men. But the fire was accurate, and {{there can be little doubt}} that the moral effect of the charge had been very great, and that these brave enemies were no longer unshaken. Be this as it may, the fact remains that they retreated swiftly, though in good order, towards the ridge of Surgham Hill, where the Khalifa's Black Flag still waved, and the 21st Lancers remained in possession of the ground--and of their dead.|$|R
40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} shown that rhythmic inter-limb {{coordination}} is disturbed in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study aims to investigate whether this coordination deficit is primarily the result of an impaired coupling, related to hypoactivation of the supplementary motor area (SMA), or primarily the indirect result of an asymmetrical distribution of PD symptoms over the left and right limbs (a peripheral process). Thirty PD patients and 30 matched control participants tapped with the index fingers anti-phase and left and <b>right</b> leading <b>gallop</b> patterns in four visual feedback conditions. Symmetrically affected participants performed significantly worse than asymmetrically affected and control participants in the gallop patterns. This result suggested that the central deficit has a stronger effect on inter-limb coupling in PD than the neuromuscular and biomechanical asymmetry between the limbs. Detailed analysis of inter-tap intervals (variability and correlation) suggested that this deficit leads to a compensatory asymmetrical inter-limb coupling in the primarily right-affected patient group, and under specific circumstances also in the primarily left-affected patient group. The difference in coordination strategy between left- and right-affected patients suggested that pre-morbid hand preference is an important structural constraint on the coupling strategies available to the participants.

50|$|Encountering a Federal {{force on}} December 17 eight miles from Lexington, Forrest sent Colonel Starnes to engage and remove this obstacle. Forrest {{immediately}} led the reminder of his command by a {{road to the}} <b>right</b> at a <b>gallop</b> {{to cut off the}} enemy retreat. He gave the lead to four Alabama companies from his old regiment under the command of Captain Frank Gurley. As soon as the artillery crossed a bridge about 6 miles from Lexington, General Forrest pushed on to where the enemy was found forming a strong position on an elevated ridge. Positioning Dibrell & Biffle's regiments as well as Gurley’s Battalion and his own escort, Gen. Forrest attacked the left of the Federal line and broke it, then turned and struck it on the flank again, scattering Col. Hawkins Tennessee Federals, leaving the 11th Regiment Illinois Volunteers and artillery to the brunt of the attack.|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the significance of}} audible gallop sounds in the right supraclavicular fossa we performed simultaneous external heart sound recordings at 50 and 100 Hz at the left ventricular apex, left sternal border, and right supraclavicular fossa in 50 patients with audible gallop sounds at the left ventricular apex. In each patient heart sounds were recorded with a simultaneous jugular phlebogram, apex cardiogram, and carotid pulse tracing. In 44 patients an apical fourth heart sound coincident with the 'a' wave of the apex cardiogram was recorded, and in 32 (73 %) the fourth heart sound was audible and recordable in the right supraclavicular fossa. A left ventricular third heart sound, coincident with the rapid filling wave of the apex tracing, was present in 25 patients but was recorded in the right supraclavicular fossa in only 7 (28 %). Intracardiac phonocardiography (high-fidelity catheter) was performed in six patients with left ventricular gallop sounds and in each instance arterial transmission of {{the third or fourth}} heart sound, or both, was present. Five additional patients had a prominent jugular venous 'a' wave, but only two had a soft parasternal fourth heart sound. Intracardiac phonocardiography in these five patients failed to reveal transmission of <b>right</b> ventricular <b>gallop</b> sounds to the superior vena cava. We conclude that since left ventricular gallop sounds commonly are transmitted to the right supraclavicular fossa auscultation in this area is often helphful in their detection. In addition, a prominent jugular venous 'a' wave sometimes produces recordable presystolic vibrations that are occasionally audible as well...|$|R
5000|$|The {{story that}} {{made its way}} around was that {{on the night of}} September 28, Morris must have gotten out of bed because someone was at his back porch. That is where he was shot dead. Then Mrs. Morris, who must have seen the murderer {{entering}} the house (after hearing the gunshot), curiously dropped the revolver she was carrying and ran to hide in the bedroom closet. That is where she was shot dead. No money was taken. No jewels were taken regardless {{of the fact that the}} Morrises jewels and money were found in the house and [...] "easily visible." [...] The killer then rode away, into the night, stealing one of Morrises best horses and was seen by neighbor Charles Rosewarne. The murderer <b>galloped</b> <b>right</b> past him, between 9:30 and 10:00 PM, and Rosewarne told everyone about the strange rider and in particular that “He wore a funny hat.” That same horse was found in South Bend, Indiana, a few days later. The horse was worn-out, exhausted, and with a “strange fresh branding on it left rear flank.” It was later revealed that Mrs. Morris were pregnant at the time of her murder.|$|R
6000|$|Almost {{before the}} British had topped {{the crest of}} the ridge, before the battery had opened from the plain, while Colonel Sloggett was still spurring across the {{dangerous}} ground between the river and the army, the Sirdar knew that his enemy was again upon him. Looking back from the slopes of Surgham, he saw that MacDonald, instead of continuing his march in echelon, had halted and deployed. The veteran brigadier had seen the Dervish formations on the ridge to the west of Surgham, realised {{that he was about to}} be attacked, and, resolving to anticipate the enemy, immediately brought his three batteries into action at 1,200 yards, Five minutes later the whole of the Khalifa's reserve, 15,000 strong, led by Yakub with the Black Flag, the bodyguard and 'all the glories' of the Dervish Empire, surged into view from behind the hill and advanced on the solitary brigade with the vigour of the first attack and thrice its chances of success. Thereupon Sir Herbert Kitchener ordered Maxwell to change front to the right and storm Surgham Hill. He sent Major Sandbach to tell Lewis to conform and come into line on Maxwell's <b>right.</b> He <b>galloped</b> himself to the British division--conveniently halted by General Gatacre on the northern crest of the ridge--and ordered Lyttelton with the 2nd Brigade to form facing west on Maxwell's left south of Surgham, and Wauchope with the 1st Brigade to hurry back to fill the wide gap between Lewis and MacDonald. Last of all he sent an officer to Collinson and the Camel Corps with orders that they should swing round to their right rear and close the open part of the [...] "V". By these movements the army, instead of facing south in echelon, with its left on the river and its right in the desert, was made to face west in line, with its left in the desert and its right reaching back to the river. It had turned nearly a complete somersault.|$|R
60|$|At {{the first}} two or three steps which Jason made, the four fiery streams {{appeared}} to gush out somewhat more plentifully; for the two brazen bulls had heard his foot tramp, and were lifting up their hot noses to snuff the air. He went a little farther, {{and by the way}} in which the red vapor now spouted forth, he judged that the creatures had got upon their feet. Now he could see glowing sparks, and vivid jets of flame. At the next step, each of the bulls made the pasture echo with a terrible roar, while the burning breath, which they thus belched forth, lit up the whole field with a momentary flash. One other stride did bold Jason make; and, suddenly as a streak of lightning, on came these fiery animals, roaring like thunder, and sending out sheets of white flame, which so kindled up the scene that the young man could discern every object more distinctly than by daylight. Most distinctly of all he saw the two horrible creatures <b>galloping</b> <b>right</b> down upon him, their brazen hoofs rattling and ringing over the ground, and their tails sticking up stiffly into the air, as has always been the fashion with angry bulls. Their breath scorched the herbage before them. So intensely hot it was, indeed, that it caught a dry tree under which Jason was now standing, and set it all in a light blaze. But as for Jason himself (thanks to Medea's enchanted ointment), the white flame curled around his body, without injuring him a jot more than if he had been made of asbestos.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Meanwhile {{the right}} wing, led {{on by the}} King in person, had fallen on the left wing of the Friedlanders. The first strong onset of the heavy Finland Cuirassiers {{scattered}} the light-mounted Poles and Croats, who were stationed here, and their tumultuous flight spread fear and disorder {{over the rest of}} the cavalry. At this moment notice reached the King that his infantry were losing ground, and likely to be driven back from the trenches they had stormed; and also that his left, exposed to a tremendous fire from the Windmills behind Lützen, could no longer keep their place. With quick decision, he committed to Von Horn the task of pursuing the already beaten left wing of the enemy; and himself hastened, at the head of Steinbock's regiment, to restore the confusion of his own. His gallant horse bore him over the trenches with the speed of lightning; but the squadrons that came after him could not pass so rapidly; and none but a few horsemen, among whom Franz Albert, Duke of Sachsen-Lauenburg, is mentioned, were alert enough to keep beside him. He <b>galloped</b> <b>right</b> to the place where his infantry was most oppressed; and while looking round to spy out some weak point, on which his attack might be directed, his short-sightedness led him too near the enemy's lines. An Imperial sergeant (gefreiter), observing that every one respectfully made room for the advancing horseman, ordered a musketeer to fire on him. [...] "Aim at him there," [...] cried he; [...] "that must be a man of consequence." [...] The soldier drew his trigger; and the King's left arm was shattered by the ball. At this instant, his cavalry came galloping up, and a confused cry of [...] "The King bleeds! The King is shot!" [...] spread horror and dismay through their ranks. [...] "It is nothing: follow me!" [...] exclaimed the King, collecting all his strength; but overcome with pain, and on the point of fainting, he desired the Duke of Lauenburg, in French, to take him without notice from the tumult. The Duke then turned with him to the right wing, making a wide circuit to conceal this accident from the desponding infantry; but as they rode along, the King received a second bullet through the back, which took from him the last remainder of his strength. [...] "I have got enough, brother," [...] said he with a dying voice: [...] "haste, save thyself." [...] With these words he sank from his horse; and here, struck by several other bullets, far from his attendants, he breathed out his life beneath the plundering hands of a troop of Croats. His horse flying on without its rider, and bathed in blood, soon announced to the Swedish cavalry the fall of their King; with wild yells they rush to the spot, to snatch that sacred spoil from the enemy. A deadly fight ensues around the corpse, and the mangled remains are buried under a hill of slain men.|$|R
