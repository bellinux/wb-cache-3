5|$|At this point, McCain's {{politics}} were mainly {{in line with}} President Ronald Reagan; this included support for <b>Reaganomics,</b> and he was active on Indian Affairs bills. He supported most aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, including its hardline stance against the Soviet Union and policy towards Central American conflicts, such as backing the Contras in Nicaragua. McCain opposed keeping U.S. Marines deployed in Lebanon citing unattainable objectives, and subsequently criticized President Reagan for pulling out the troops too late; in the interim, the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing killed hundreds. McCain won re-election to the House easily in 1984, and gained {{a spot on the}} House Foreign Affairs Committee. In 1985, he made his first return trip to Vietnam, and also traveled to Chile where he met with its military junta ruler, General Augusto Pinochet.|$|E

The New Zealand Listener coined the term Rogernomics for these policies, drawing connections with <b>Reaganomics</b> and with Thatcherism.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, Ronald Reagan {{introduced}} <b>Reaganomics.</b> That is, fiscally expansive economic policies, cutting marginal {{federal income}} tax rates by 25%. Inflation dropped dramatically from 13.5% annually in 1980 to just 3% annually in 1983 due to a short recession and the Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker's tighter control of the money supply and interest rates. Real GDP began to grow after contracting in 1980 and 1982. The unemployment rate continued to rise to a peak of 10.8% by late 1982, but dropped well under 6% unemployment {{at the end of}} Reagan's presidency in January 1989.|$|E
25|$|Harvey {{was an avid}} pilot. He {{served in}} the US Army Air Corps from 1943-1944. Harvey had been an Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) member for more than 50 years, and would {{occasionally}} talk about flying to his radio audience. He {{was a member of}} the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA), and was frequently seen at EAA AirVenture in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. He was responsible for funding the Paul Harvey Audio-Video Center at EAA headquarters in Oshkosh. Harvey was also an early investor in the Duluth, Minnesota-based aircraft manufacturing company, Cirrus Aircraft. According to AOPA Pilot contributing editor Barry Schiff, Harvey coined the term skyjack, and is credited with popularizing the terms <b>Reaganomics</b> and guesstimate.|$|E
500|$|His legacy {{includes}} the Kemp–Roth Tax Cut of the 1980s, {{also known as}} the first of two [...] "Reagan tax cuts." [...] These served as the foundation of supply-side economics, known as <b>Reaganomics.</b> [...] Many Republicans have endorsed this Laffer Curve view that tax cuts spur economic growth and reduce deficits. Although George H. W. Bush called this philosophy voodoo economics, George W. Bush and his Treasury Secretary, John W. Snow, were believers. Kemp is also remembered alongside George Wallace and William Jennings Bryan for influencing history by changing the direction of presidential elections despite their defeats.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to his rapping, Nas achieved significance for his poetic use of language. Professor Adilifu Nama of California State University Northridge writes, “With Illmatic, hip-hop witnessed the birth of an urban griot telling hard-boiled tales of ghetto alienation and triumph like a spoken-word of a Chester Himes novel" [...] Author and music writer Todd Boyd wrote of Nas' urban realism, stating that his [...] "poetic lyrics {{are some of the}} most poignant words ever to describe the postindustrial urban experience. His spoken-word like delivery and his vivid use of metaphor placed him at the top of the game in terms of overall skills as an MC and as a cultural commentator." [...] An OhWord.com columnist similarly described Nas as a [...] "genius introvert who rose out of the rubble of <b>Reaganomics</b> to bless the mic with a forward brand of introspective, redemptive street poetry". Princeton University professor Imani Perry also describes Illmatic as [...] "ars poetica, a definitive statement for the art of hip-hop poetry." ...|$|E
500|$|Reagan {{implemented}} policies {{based on}} supply-side economics, advocating a laissez-faire philosophy and free-market fiscal policy, seeking {{to stimulate the}} economy with large, across-the-board tax cuts. He also supported returning the United States to some sort of gold standard, and successfully urged Congress to establish the U.S. Gold Commission to study how one could be implemented. Citing the economic theories of Arthur Laffer, Reagan promoted the proposed tax cuts as potentially stimulating the economy enough to expand the tax base, offsetting the revenue loss due to reduced rates of taxation, a theory that entered political discussion as the Laffer curve. <b>Reaganomics</b> was the subject of debate with supporters pointing to improvements in certain key economic indicators as evidence of success, and critics pointing to large increases in federal budget deficits and the national debt. His policy of [...] "peace through strength" [...] resulted in a record peacetime defense buildup including a 40% real increase in defense spending between 1981 and 1985.|$|E
500|$|McCain’s {{politics}} {{at this point}} were mainly in line with those of President Ronald Reagan, whom McCain would later describe as his greatest political influence: [...] "I embraced all of the core Reagan convictions: faith in the individual; skepticism of government; free trade and vigorous capitalism; anticommunism; a strong defense; robust internationalism that championed our values abroad; and most important, his eloquently stated belief in America's national greatness ..." [...] McCain supported <b>Reaganomics.</b> [...] He {{was in favor of}} school prayer and opposed abortion. [...] He subscribed to most aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, including its hardline stance against the Soviet Union. He supported the Reagan administration's policy towards Central American conflicts, including the invasion of Grenada in 1983 and U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua. [...] During the early 1980s, he served {{on the board of the}} U.S. Council for World Freedom, a chapter of the World Anti-Communist League which was an international group that, among other things, aided the rebels in Nicaragua; McCain suspected the council of illegal activity and resigned in 1984.|$|E
500|$|The National Rainbow Coalition (Rainbow Coalition for short) was a {{political}} organization {{that grew out of}} Jesse Jackson's 1984 presidential campaign. During the campaign, Jackson began speaking about a [...] "Rainbow Coalition", an idea created by Fred Hampton, regarding the disadvantaged and welcomed voters from a broad spectrum of races and creeds. The goals of the campaign were to demand social programs, voting rights, and affirmative action for all groups that had been neglected by <b>Reaganomics.</b> Jackson's campaign blamed President Ronald Reagan's policies for reduction of government domestic spending, causing new unemployment and encouraging economic investment outside of the inner cities, while they discouraged the rebuilding of urban industry. The industrial layoffs caused by these policies hit the black and other minority populations particularly hard. At the 1984 Democratic National Convention on July 18, 1984, in San Francisco, California, Jackson delivered an address entitled [...] "The Rainbow Coalition". [...] The speech called for Arab Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans, youth, disabled veterans, small farmers, lesbians and gays to join with African Americans and Jewish Americans for political purpose. Whereas the purpose of PUSH had been to fight for economic and educational opportunities, the Rainbow Coalition was created to address political empowerment and public policy issues. After his unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination in 1984, Jackson attempted to build a broad base of support among groups that [...] "were hurt by Reagan administration policies" [...] - racial minorities, the poor, small farmers, working mothers, the unemployed, some labor union members, gays, and lesbians.|$|E
500|$|... "Valley Girls" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{comments from}} reviewers. TV Guides Jennifer Sankowski enjoyed the episode and believed the producers had captured {{all aspects of}} popular 1980s teen culture well, but that [...] "at times it {{felt like they were}} trying too hard, throwing everything and anything '80s at us" [...] such as a montage of 1980s outfits worn by Lily and mentions of MTV videos, fanny packs, Rubik's Cube, and Jane Fonda workout videos. [...] "At this rate," [...] said Sankowski, [...] "they won't have anything left to showcase." [...] Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly [...] "loved" [...] the episode and complimented the casting choices, but agrees with Sankowski in that [...] "if this ends up being an actual series, they need to dial down the '80s references a tad." [...] Kona Gallagher of Cinema Blend said the premise was interesting and that [...] " [...] {{has the potential to be}} a strong spinoff, and [...] hope that CW decides to pick it up this fall." [...] Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times writes that he [...] "especially liked the moxie of Brittany Snow as young Lily and Krysten Ritter [...] as her sister, Carol. And of course the retro soundtrack was a total trip." [...] A few review sites took issue with the episode's script, such as BuddyTV, which claimed it was cliché, and Television Without Pity, which found it repetitive. While writing for The Frisky, Sara Benincasa praised the clothing styles and called the overall episode [...] "awesome fun! [...] weirdly sentimental, and sweet". She also believed that the confrontation between the Valley dwellers and the rich attendees of Keith's party was [...] "clearly a giant, dance-friendly metaphor for <b>Reaganomics</b> and the woes of a trickle-down world." [...] Michelle Graham for Film School Rejects liked both the 1980s and present day scenes separately, but when put together, [...] "the overall effect was disjointed and showed it for what it was: an attempt to shove two shows together in order to save money on a proper pilot." ...|$|E
2500|$|These new tax {{policies}} also arguably curbed several existing tax loopholes, preferences, and exceptions, but <b>Reaganomics</b> {{is typically}} remembered for its trickle down effect of taxing poor Americans more than rich ones. <b>Reaganomics</b> has (along with legislation passed under presidents George H.

2500|$|During the Nixon and Ford Administrations, a {{combined}} {{supply and demand}} side policy was considered unconventional by the moderate wing of the Republican Party. While running against Reagan for the Presidential nomination in 1980, George H. W. Bush had derided <b>Reaganomics</b> as [...] "voodoo economics". Similarly, in 1976, Gerald Ford had severely criticized Reagan's proposal to turn back {{a large part of}} the Federal budget to the states.|$|E
2500|$|Dayton ran unsuccessfully in the U.S. Senate {{campaign}} in 1982 against Republican Party incumbent David Durenberger. He defeated former U.S. Senator Eugene McCarthy in the Democratic primary, {{and the general}} election {{became one of the}} most expensive in state history. Dayton campaigned as a populist in opposition to <b>Reaganomics</b> and famously promised [...] "to close tax loopholes for the rich and the corporations [...] and if you think that includes the Daytons, you're right". After his defeat, Dayton returned to the Perpich administration until his election as Minnesota State Auditor in 1990.|$|E
2500|$|The Laffer {{curve and}} supply-side {{economics}} inspired <b>Reaganomics</b> and the Kemp-Roth Tax Cut of 1981. Supply-side advocates {{of tax cuts}} claimed that lower tax rates would generate more tax revenue because the United States government's marginal income tax rates prior to the legislation were {{on the right-hand side}} of the curve. This assertion was derided by George H. W. Bush as [...] "voodoo economics" [...] while running against Reagan for the Presidential nomination in 1980. During the Reagan presidency, the top marginal rate of tax in the United States fell from 70% to 31%.|$|E
2500|$|From 1891 {{until the}} party's dissolution, Red Tories {{generally}} dominated the highest rungs {{of the party}} and its leadership. The emerging neoconservatives of the 1970s were significantly reduced in numbers in the party by the late 1980s, and many of the disaffected drifted towards neoliberalism and parties with a neoconservative bent, such as the Reform Party of Canada. When the PC party held power at the federal level, it never truly embraced <b>Reaganomics</b> and its crusade against [...] "big government" [...] as vociferously as was done in the USA.|$|E
2500|$|The Austin Chronicles {{film critic}} Marjorie Baumgarten also {{appreciated}} the film, and she wrote, [...] "Kopple's Academy Award-winning documentary American Dream exposes the human cost of Reaganomics...What American Dream {{wants to learn}} is: how did this human tragedy happen—at Hormel of all places, a company {{with a reputation for}} progressivism? Decades ago it {{was among the first to}} furnish its workers with guaranteed annual wages and profit-sharing plans. Generations of family members worked at the plant, taking pride in their products and their relationship to the manufacturing process. The answer the movie presents is <b>Reaganomics,</b> the 'as long as I've got mine, the hell with everyone else' attitude prevalent in the 1980s".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{have criticized}} {{elements}} of <b>Reaganomics</b> {{on the basis}} of equity. For example, economist John Kenneth Galbraith believed that the Reagan administration actively used the Laffer curve [...] "to lower taxes on the affluent". Some critics point out that tax revenues almost always rise every year, and during Reagan's two terms increases in tax revenue were more shallow than increases during presidencies where top marginal tax rates were higher. Critics also point out that since the Reagan tax cuts, income has not significantly increased {{for the rest of the}} population. [...] This assertion is supported by studies that show the income of the top 1% nearly doubling during the Reagan years, while income for other income levels increased only marginally; income actually decreased for the bottom quintile.|$|E
2500|$|Milton Friedman stated, [...] "Reaganomics {{had four}} simple principles: Lower {{marginal}} tax rates, less regulation, restrained government spending, noninflationary monetary policy. Though Reagan did not achieve {{all of his}} goals, he made good progress." [...] Further, The Heritage Foundation stated, [...] "the U.S. government must allow the entrepreneur to enjoy the rewards of success. If taxes take away most profit, then the entrepreneur will have less incentive to take a risk. If there are great restrictions on how the entrepreneur can use his profit, then {{there is little reason}} for the entrepreneur to take a risk. The entrepreneur's courage to take a risk is what leads to new American discoveries and what drives the U.S. economy forward. <b>Reaganomics</b> knows this. It {{is one of the reasons}} why Ronald Reagan has reduced American taxes dramatically." ...|$|E
2500|$|President Ronald Reagan {{selected}} Donald Regan in 1981 {{to serve}} as Treasury Secretary, marking him as a spokesman for his economic policies, dubbed <b>Reaganomics.</b> He helped engineer changes in the tax code, reduce income tax rates and decrease taxes for corporations. [...] Regan unexpectedly swapped jobs with then White House Chief of Staff James Baker in 1985. As chief of staff, Regan was closely involved in the day-to-day management of White House policy, which led Howard Baker, Regan's successor as chief of staff, to give a rebuke that Regan was becoming a [...] "prime minister" [...] inside an increasingly complex imperial presidency. Regan was eventually forced to resign due to disagreements with the First Lady and his inability to contain the continuing political damage to President Reagan from the Iran–Contra affair.|$|E
2500|$|The Community for Creative Non-Violence is a {{group based}} in Washington D.C. with a mission [...] "to ensure that {{the rights of the}} {{homeless}} and poor are not infringed upon and that every person has access to life's basic essentials -- food, shelter, clothing and medical care". Since 1978 the group served a Thanksgiving meal for the homeless in Washington D.C. By November 26, 1981 the group had changed locations of the gathering and ended up in Lafayette Park near the White House. The event gained media attention as the poor were eating a warm meal with 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in the background. In addition to the feast a few members set up ten tents {{in the form of a}} village. The group proclaimed “Welcome to Reaganville / Population growing daily / <b>Reaganomics</b> at work.” The name references the depression-era “Hoovervilles” that were camps of the homeless. The group stated they would try and continue the protest into the winter. The Park Police stated that the Thanksgiving dinner had a legal permit but that overnight sleeping would not be tolerated. The next day, November, 26th, police removed the homeless from the area. On November 30 the CCNV obtained a one-week renewable permit. This permit stated that: ...|$|E
2500|$|According to William A. Niskanen, one of {{the architects}} of <b>Reaganomics,</b> [...] "Reagan {{delivered}} on each of his four major policy objectives, although not {{to the extent that}} he and his supporters had hoped", and notes that the most substantial change was in the tax code, where the top marginal individual income tax rate fell from 70.1% to 28.4%, and there was a [...] "major reversal in the tax treatment of business income", with effect of [...] "reducing the tax bias among types of investment but increasing the average effective tax rate on new investment". Roger Porter, another architect of the program, acknowledges that the program was weakened by the many hands that changed the President's calculus, such as Congress. President Reagan raised taxes eleven times over the course of his presidency, all in the name of fiscal responsibility, but the overall tax burden went down during his presidency. According to Paul Krugman, [...] "Over all, the 1982 tax increase undid about a third of the 1981 cut; as a share of GDP, the increase was substantially larger than Mr. Clinton's 1993 tax increase." [...] According to historian and domestic policy adviser Bruce Bartlett, Reagan's tax increases over the course of his presidency took back half of the 1981 tax cut. Though since the Reagan tax reductions, top marginal tax rates have remained lower than at any point in US history since 1931, when the top marginal rate was raised from 25% to 63%.|$|E
