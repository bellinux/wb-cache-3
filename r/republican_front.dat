25|$|The fog having {{returned}} on 10 September, {{an all-out}} {{attack by the}} I Brigade took the hill of Biforco (below the pass of El Mazuco), but this was still dominated by the heights of Llabres, from where the Republicans hammered the area with machine guns and rolled down carbide drums filled with explosive. For {{the first time since}} the start of the battle, hot food reached the <b>Republican</b> <b>front</b> lines.|$|E

25|$|By 13 September the <b>Republican</b> <b>front</b> to the north-west of El Mazuco {{began to}} weaken under the {{relentless}} artillery bombardment, and the Republicans {{were forced to}} yield Sierra Llabres, whose height commands both the village of El Mazuco and the western approaches on 14 September. The village of El Mazuco itself was then indefensible. To the south, Pico Turbina was almost taken, but the attack was driven back with hand-grenades, in confused fighting in dense fog.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{considerable}} congressional resistance, {{presidential and}} popular pressure {{led to a}} November 1993 agreement brokered by the Catholic Church between the administration and Congress. This package of constitutional reforms was approved by popular referendum on 30 January 1994. In August 1994, a new Congress was elected to complete the unexpired term. Controlled by the anti-corruption parties: the populist Guatemalan <b>Republican</b> <b>Front</b> (FRG) headed by Ríos Montt, and the center-right National Advancement Party (PAN), the new Congress began to abandon the corruption that characterized its predecessors.|$|E
25|$|The {{main goal}} of the Republicans was to delay the Nationalist advance until the winter came, nevertheless, then the Legion Condor {{returned}} from the Aragon front and started to bomb the Republican positions. The German squadrons used napalm (cans of petrol attached to incendiary bombs) and tested {{the idea of the}} carpet bombing. On 14 October Arriondas fell, and the Colonel Muñoz Grandes managed to break the <b>republican</b> <b>front,</b> entering in Tama and advancing to Campo de Caso. The Republican troops retreated to Gijón and on 15 October the Solchaga's troops joined up with Aranda's troops.|$|E
25|$|In April 1995 Portillo, {{along with}} another seven of the DCG's 13 deputies, left the party to become independents after the {{parliamentary}} group was accused of corruption. On July 20, 1995 he joined the Guatemalan <b>Republican</b> <b>Front</b> (FRG). Its leader, Efraín Ríos Montt, {{was at the time}} leader of Congress. When Ríos Montt was constitutionally barred from running in the November 12 presidential election because he had previously taken power through a coup d'etat, the FRG chose Portillo as their candidate. After gaining 22% of the vote {{in the first round of}} voting, he lost to Álvaro Arzú in the second round on January 7, 1996.

50|$|The Siege of the Alcázar at Toledo {{early in}} the war was a turning point, with the rebels winning after a long siege.

Soon, though, the rebels began to erode their territory, starving Madrid and making inroads into the east. The north, including the Basque country, fell in late 1937, and the Aragon front collapsed shortly afterwards.

25|$|In 2003, Foley {{was widely}} {{considered}} the <b>Republican</b> <b>front</b> runner for Bob Graham's Senate seat, especially after Graham had announced his retirement. However, longstanding rumors surfaced that Foley was either homosexual or bisexual {{and was in}} a long-term homosexual relationship. The story was initially published only in local and gay press; then the New Times broke {{the story in the}} mainstream press. Other alternative press rivals, including the New York Press, then addressed the topic. Foley held a press conference to denounce the “revolting” rumors and stated that his sexual orientation was unimportant, but did not specifically deny the rumors. A few weeks later, he withdrew his candidacy, saying his father's battle with cancer had caused him to reassess his perspective on life (the seat was later won by Republican Mel Martinez). Foley had raised $3 million in campaign contributions before withdrawing.|$|E
25|$|The UDSR {{joined the}} <b>Republican</b> <b>Front,</b> a centre-left coalition, {{which won the}} 1956 {{legislative}} election. As Justice Minister (1956–1957), Mitterrand allowed the expansion of martial law in the Algerian conflict. Unlike other ministers (including Mendès-France), who criticised the repressive policy in Algeria, he remained in Guy Mollet's cabinet until its end. As Minister of Justice, he {{had a role in}} 45 executions of the Algerian natives, recommending President Rene Coty to reject clemency in 80% of the cases, an action he later came to regret. Mitterrand's role in confirming the death sentences of FLN rebels convicted by French courts of terrorism and later in abolishing the death penalty in 1981 led the British writer Anthony Daniels (writing under his pseudonym of Theodore Dalrymple) to accuse Mitterrand of being an unprincipled opportunist, a cynical politician who proudly confirmed death sentences of FLN terrorists in the 1950s when it was popular and who only came to champion abolishing the death penalty when was popular with the French people.|$|E
500|$|Parliamentary seats {{reserved}} for whites were abolished in 1987. Van der Byl made his last speech in Parliament on 10 September, {{in which he}} praised Robert Mugabe for the [...] "absolute courtesy" [...] he had shown since independence. He noted {{that he was the}} last surviving member of the 1965 government remaining in Parliament, and declared he hoped [...] "I would have been cherished [...]. as a sort of national monument, and not flung into the political wilderness". His speech loudly denounced the former <b>Republican</b> <b>Front</b> and Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe members who had gone over to the government, describing them as [...] "dreadful souls screaming in agony". The government minister Dr Edson Zvobgo responded with a poorly written poem referring to the number of rebels killed fighting troops under Van der Byl's command.|$|E

500|$|As Mugabe's main {{opponent}} in Parliament {{at the head}} of the <b>Republican</b> <b>Front</b> (as the RF renamed itself in 1981), Smith presented himself as the guardian of what he called Zimbabwe's [...] "white tribe". He spoke gloomily about Zimbabwe's future prospects, repeatedly accused the Mugabe administration of corruption, malevolence and general incompetence, and criticised Mugabe's support for a one-party system. The RF took an increasingly confrontational line in the House after Mugabe and other government ministers began regularly pouring scorn on the white community in national broadcasts and other media. Amid rising tensions with South Africa, various white Zimbabweans were arrested, accused of being South African agents, and tortured. When Smith complained about whites being imprisoned without trial under emergency powers, a number of ZANU–PF MPs pointed out that they themselves had been detained under that same legislation, and for far longer, by Smith's government. Mugabe openly admitted torturing suspected spies, had some who were found not guilty by the High Court immediately rearrested on the street outside, and accused Western critics of caring only because the people in question were white.|$|E

He nevertheless said discussions would continue with the other parties and also insisted, in reaction to suggestions that the UFC was divided, that Olympio supported his candidacy.

2500|$|The Democratic Unionist Party {{evolved from}} the Protestant Unionist Party, which itself {{grew out of the}} Ulster Protestant Action movement. The DUP was founded on 30 September 1971 by Ian Paisley, leader of the Protestant Unionist Party, and Desmond Boal, {{formerly}} of the Ulster Unionist Party. Paisley, a well-known Protestant fundamentalist minister, [...] was the founder and leader of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster. He would lead both the DUP and the Free Presbyterian Church for the next 37 years, and his party and church would be closely linked. When the DUP formed, Northern Ireland {{was in the midst of}} an ethnic-nationalist conflict known as the Troubles, which began in 1969 and would last for the next thirty years. The conflict began amid a campaign to end discrimination against the Catholic/Irish nationalist minority by the Protestant/unionist government and police force. This protest campaign was opposed, often violently, by unionists who viewed it as an Irish <b>republican</b> <b>front.</b> Paisley had led the unionist opposition to the civil rights movement. The DUP were more hardline or loyalist than the UUP and its founding arguably stemmed from worries of the Ulster Protestant working class that the UUP was not paying them enough heed.|$|E
