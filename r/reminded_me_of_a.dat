500|$|In {{the days}} {{immediately}} following the attacks, many memorials and vigils were held around the world, and photographs {{of the dead and}} missing were posted around Ground Zero. A witness described being unable to [...] "get away from faces of innocent victims who were killed. Their pictures are everywhere, on phone booths, street lights, walls of subway stations. Everything <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> huge funeral, people quiet and sad, but also very nice. Before, New York gave me a cold feeling; now people were reaching out to help each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Tung's men charged {{forward in}} a V-shaped riot formation. According to Halberstam, [...] "they pranced into the pagoda, looking {{something}} like a smart football team coming up {{to the line of}} scrimmage". In the end, it took around two hours to complete the raids because many of the occupants had entrenched themselves inside the various rooms in anticipation of the attacks and doors had to be unhinged to reach them. According to journalist Neil Sheehan, who was at the scene, [...] "The raid on Xá Lợi, like those on the pagodas elsewhere in South Vietnam, was flawlessly executed. It <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> scene from a movie of the French Resistance—the scene when the Gestapo arrive at the Resistance hideout in Paris." [...] William Prochnau said that [...] "Using the elite guard against the Buddhists was analogous to using Green Berets to put down Negro protests at home. It was outrageous." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} 7 Khoon Maaf came when Ruskin Bond sent his book of Short Story {{collection}} to Vishal Bhardwaj. He {{was intrigued by}} a four-page story's title named [...] "Susanna's Seven Husbands", and thought it had potential for a novel and a film. Bhardwaj said, [...] "I told myself why would a woman have seven husbands and then I came {{to know that she}} also kills them! I was immediately hooked to it. It <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> very old film, Bluebeard's Seven Wives". Bhardwaj suggested the story to a fellow director, who was looking for a good story. However, after reading the short story, the director dismissed it saying it has no film potential. After reading the story twice, he became even more confident about possibility of a film. Bhardwaj who had previously adapted Bond's novel The Blue Umbrella into a film, decided to adapt the short story for the screen. Bhardwaj later requested Bond to turn the story into a novella, noting that only Bond could flesh out the characters well, to which he agreed. Bond expanded the story into an 80-page novella, which later became a 200-page full-length Hindi script. Bhardwaj co-wrote the script with Matthew Robbins.|$|E
2500|$|Block {{was then}} {{assigned}} to {{the staff at the}} BBC to add American comedic sensibility to the Anglo-American Hour and Yankee Doodle Doo radio programs. Maurice Gorham, BBC executive and journalist who had [...] "seen a lot of Block" [...] during his BBC days, gave his impressions of Block as [...] "a real Broadway type who <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Damon Runyon character suddenly set down in a Broadcasting House." [...] His contribution to the BBC was once singled out by the North American Representative of the BBC, Lindsay Wellington, to dispute Associated Press accusations of excessive British censorship. In a December 6, 1943 letter to the New York Times he wrote, [...] "Nor would it have been possible for Hal Block, American scriptwriter, to write the highly popular London-produced program for combined U.S. and British soldier audiences Yankee Doodle Doo." ...|$|E

2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film 4 stars out of 4, writing: [...] "Kill Bill, Volume 1 shows Quentin Tarantino so {{effortlessly}} and brilliantly {{in command of}} his technique that he <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> virtuoso violinist racing through 'Flight of the Bumble Bee'– or maybe an accordion prodigy setting a speed record for 'Lady of Spain'.

500|$|Her verse in Kanye West's [...] "Monster" [...] was {{critically}} acclaimed and contributed greatly to her popularity; many critics {{said she had}} the best verse in the song. Her alter egos are incorporated with her lyrics in British accents (Roman Zolanski) or soft-spokenness (Harajuku Barbie). Ice-T said about Minaj's rapping style, [...] " [...] does her thing.

50|$|Final track Commotion {{opens with}} a slight 80s OST vibe, and while many have remarked {{positively}} on his vocals before, I do feel its necessary to commend them here once more, they are such <b>an</b> integral part <b>of</b> how the whole EP behaves and works so well. Colours is electronic composition at its absolute finest, it <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> much much better version of Londons Ghost Culture matched with the natural talent of Corks Bantum, and its easily {{one of the best}} Irish EPs to be released this year, in any genre.|$|R

60|$|Such was Bickley {{with his}} clever, well-cut face that always <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cameo, and {{thoughtful}} brow; his strong, capable hands and his rather steely mouth, the mere set of which suggested controversy of an uncompromising kind.

60|$|Another {{very curious}} craft {{often seen in}} the Liverpool docks, is the Dutch galliot, an old-fashioned looking gentleman, with hollow waist, high prow and stern, and which, seen lying among crowds of tight Yankee traders, and pert French brigantines, always <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cocked hat among modish beavers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hearing this, I {{ventured to}} make some inquiries.

500|$|After the Indiana game, Dari Nowkhah {{wrote in}} ESPN's [...] "Heisman Watch" [...] column that Robinson was [...] "running {{away with the}} Heisman Trophy" [...] and {{compared}} him to 1988 Heisman Trophy winner Barry Sanders:"We haven't seen this type of college football playmaker since ... Barry Sanders? [...] I'm not saying Robinson <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Sanders. (How could <b>a</b> quarterback <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> running back?)

Being that dominant on a football field somehow feels wrong. It's unfair." ...|$|R
500|$|Wood {{began dating}} British actor Jamie Bell in 2005 after they co-starred {{in the music}} video for Green Day's song [...] "Wake Me Up When September Ends."

Wood later commented that, [...] "We had matching tattoos because we knew our love would last forever. Trouble is, it didn't, things happened, we split. But I don't regret the tattoo.

5000|$|... “My fellow artist Akim Monet {{invited me}} to lunch {{at his home in}} New York City.As I entered his dining room, I was {{immediately}} struck by several large scale photographs of India. Their saturated colors emanating ethereal light beckoned me to look closer. I felt the spirituality of India, standing there with the afternoon light streaming through the windows, highlighting the details in Monet’s images. The solarized effect of the print adds to the sense <b>of</b> otherworldliness and <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> x-ray—allowing the viewer a view within and <b>an</b> understanding <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Passage to India.Akim Monet is a true visionary in more ways than one”.
