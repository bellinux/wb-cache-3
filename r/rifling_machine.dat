50|$|Charles St. George had to {{convince}} Australian engineering companies {{that it was possible}} to make gun parts and that close tolerances were not imperative, as is the common belief. Barrels from Lithgow were too expensive so St. George designed and built his own button <b>rifling</b> <b>machine</b> using a self-rotating button with a pushing motion. The barrel blanks were imported from Parker Hale in the United Kingdom with H&K providing the chamber machining details and Chartered Industries of Singapore supplied the 20-round M16 magazines.|$|E
50|$|In 1862 Vavasseur's firm became {{subcontractor}} to captain Alexander Blakely, RA, {{who held}} {{a number of}} patents in gun construction and sold guns to countries in Europe, South America and particularly North America, where demand was high due to the Civil War. Vavasseur initially produced a series of 2.9 inch guns for the Confederate States, but the ship carrying them foundered, and they never reached their destination. Vavasseur's <b>rifling</b> <b>machine</b> was employed by Blakely for the rifling {{of some of his}} largest guns. In 1863 Vavasseur and Blakely collaborated on the production of spherical steel shot, intended to penetrate the armour of ironclads coming into service at the time. Later in 1863 Josiah Vavasseur and Company merged with The Blakely Cannon Company, resulting in the Blakely Ordnance Company, with Josiah Vavasseur as engineer and manager. In 1865 the new company became The Blakely Ordnance Company, Limited with Vavasseur as Resident Engineer. One year later, the panic of 1866 caused a squeeze on liquidity that forced The Blakely Ordnance Company, Limited into liquidation, and Vavasseur out of his job.|$|E
