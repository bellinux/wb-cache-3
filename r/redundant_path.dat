50|$|In one {{plus one}} (1+1) architecture, a single {{protection}} path {{is used to}} protect the signal. In this case the bridge {{at the head of}} the path is permanent. It is at the tail end where the switching occurs. In this architecture traffic is sent over two parallel routes, and the destination or the receiving end selects the better of these two signals. In case of any failure, the destination switches onto the alternative path/route. This architecture is simple for implementation and results fast restoration. Its major drawback is the wastage of bandwidth, since no traffic travels through the <b>redundant</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E

The primary objective of the proposed scheme is to avoid lost of wind farms power in case permanent faults by providing an alternative path for the power flow through a <b>redundant</b> <b>path.</b> In case of DC faults resistive fault current limiters were used to suppress the current to a reasonable level to enable disconnection of the faulty line.

30|$|MPNC (multiple {{path and}} network coding) is {{proposed}} as a reliable transport protocol for UWASN (underwater acoustic sensor network). In MPNC, after three disjoint paths being established, {{two groups of}} packets (A and B), coded by network coding, are transmitted over the two side paths respectively, and another group of packets C[*]=[*]A[*]⊕[*]B are transmitted over the middle path. That is, any two paths can work together as a <b>redundant</b> <b>path</b> for another path, and the reliable transmission of one packet can be guaranteed by 1.5 packets. In {{order to reduce the}} number of redundant packets without affecting the transmission reliability, the packets of group C are coded further at special ratio by network coding as shareable redundant packets according to the link error, and a reliable transport protocol TPNC (twin path and network coding) based on two paths and network coding is proposed in this paper. In TPNC, after two disjoint paths, called twin paths, being established, two groups of packets (A and B), coded by network coding, are transmitted with their own shareable redundant packets over the two paths respectively to guarantee the data packet transmission reliability. The results of simulations show that, compared with MPNC, TPNC can acquire similar data delivery ratio with lower energy consumption.|$|E
40|$|Probabilistic packet marking (PPM) is a {{technique}} designed to identify packet traffic sources with low storage and processing overhead on network routers. In most previous PPM approaches, individual path messages carry only partial path information. These methods are susceptible to “path falsification ” attacks, which greatly reduce their effectiveness. This work proposes a path-falsification-attack free PPM algorithm called Path Information Caching and Aggregation (PICA) that records paths of packet streams in fixlength path messages, thus eliminating the need of path reconstruction at the receiver end. Besides, by using a router’s forwarding table to decompose packet volume, this semi-stateful method is more accurate in traffic volume report. It also supports both a packet rate-based path message generation algorithm and a <b>redundant</b> <b>path</b> message suppression mechanism to further eliminate path messages with the same destination. Finally, PICA protects PICA routers from being attacked by faked path messages. We have performed a trace-driven simulation study on the proposed PICA algorithm and compared its effectiveness with IETF’s iTrace scheme by varying the sampling probability, the number of attack sources, and attack traffic rate. Compared to iTrace, the PICA algorithm reduces {{the total number of}} path messages required by a factor of more than 2, while reporting traffic volume more accurately. 1...|$|E
