25|$|A canal between Bamberg and Nuremberg started {{operation}} in 1843. There was a port at Poppenreuth.

25|$|For example, the Hindenburg-lock (in Hannover, Germany, built 1919–1928) has two lock {{chambers}} of 225 m length, {{each of which}} would use 42,000 m³ of water for a full locking cycle. Due {{to the use of}} 10 water saving basins, only 10,500 m³ of water are used. A more recent example is the <b>Rhine–Main–Danube</b> <b>Canal</b> with 13 saving locks {{out of a total of}} 16 locks.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, the Soviet {{authorities}} {{issued a}} request for tenders {{for the construction of}} a vessel capable of carrying 25 to 30 barges with displacement of 1,300 tons. At that time, the Soviet Union had the most extensive inland waterway system in the world and the <b>Rhine–Main–Danube</b> <b>Canal</b> connecting the North Sea to the Black Sea was expected to open in the near future. Together with the increasing oil prices, the development of efficient barge-carrying systems with high loading and unloading rate generated considerable interest in the Soviet Union.|$|E

This key position has determined the 19th century-long co-existence of Ruschuk.|$|E
2500|$|The Danube–Black Sea Canal (...) is a canal in Romania, {{which runs}} from Cernavodă, on the Danube, to Constanța (southern arm, as main branch), and to Năvodari (northern arm), on the Black Sea. Administrated from Agigea, {{it is an}} {{important}} part of the European canal system that links the North Sea (through the <b>Rhine–Main–Danube</b> <b>Canal)</b> to the Black Sea. The main branch of the canal, with a length of , which connects the Port of Cernavodă with the Port of Constanța, was built in 1976–1984, while the north branch, known as the Poarta Albă – Midia Năvodari Canal, with a length of , between Poarta Albă and Port of Midia, was built in 1983–1987.|$|E
2500|$|The {{bridge is}} a {{cable-stayed}} design {{with a single}} pylon. The foundation for the pylon is a circular diaphragm wall with 113 bored piles. The main span is constructed from 8,600 tons of bridge construction steel (grade S355J2+N), supported by 80 stay cables, and is counterbalanced by a post-tensioned, reinforced concrete back span of [...] The approach towards New Belgrade is constructed as a 388m post-tensioned, reinforced concrete side span as continuous beam box girder with a similar arrangement of deck as the back span. Component parts of the deck were manufactured in China and delivered in transportable units on a sea and river-route via Rotterdam through the <b>Rhine–Main–Danube</b> <b>Canal</b> to the pre-assembly yard next to the construction site at Mala Ciganlija in Belgrade. The stay cables used to support the bridge deck have a maximum length of approximately , and in total 1280 tons of high grade steel {{is used for the}} 80 cables with up to 91 strands.|$|E
2500|$|The world's largest lock was, until 2016, the Berendrecht Lock, {{giving access}} to the Port of Antwerp in Belgium. In 2016 the [...] in the same port became the largest. The lock is [...] long, and [...] wide and drops , and has four sliding lock gates. The size of locks cannot be {{compared}} without considering the difference in water level that {{they are designed to}} operate under. For example, the Bollène lock on the River Rhône has a fall of at least , the Leerstetten, Eckersmühlen and Hilpoltstein locks on the <b>Rhine–Main–Danube</b> <b>Canal</b> have a fall of , each and the Oskemen Lock on the Irtysh River in Kazakhstan has a drop of [...] The total volume of water to be considered in any lock equals the product of its length, breadth and the difference in water levels. Lock staircases are used in an attempt to reduce the total volume of water required in relation to the amount of useful work done. The useful work done relates to the weight of the vessel and the height it is lifted. When a vessel is lowered the consumption of potential energy of the water consumed is considered. An alternative to locks is a boat lift; facilities of this type, e.g. the Anderton boat lift or the Strépy-Thieu boat lift in Belgium, do not rely on the consumption of water as the primary power source, are powered by motors and are designed to consume a minimum amount of water.|$|E
