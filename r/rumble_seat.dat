25|$|In 1926, Walter P. Chrysler {{decided to}} compete with North American marques Cadillac, Lincoln, Packard, Pierce Arrow, Cord and Duesenberg in the luxury car field. Chrysler offered a variety of body styles: a two/four-passenger {{roadster}} (four passenger if car had the <b>rumble</b> <b>seat),</b> a four-seat coupé, five-passenger sedan and phaeton, and a seven-passenger top-of-the-line limousine. The limo had a glass partition between {{the front and rear}} passenger compartments.|$|E
25|$|A {{convertible}} {{is a type}} {{of automobile}} in which the roof can retract and fold away having windows which wind-down inside the doors, converting it from an enclosed to an open-air vehicle. Many different automobile body styles are manufactured and marketed in convertible form. Ben P. Ellerbeck conceived the first practical retractable hardtop system in 1922—a manually operated system on a Hudson coupe that allowed unimpeded use of the <b>rumble</b> <b>seat</b> even with the top down.|$|E
50|$|Before World War I, <b>rumble</b> <b>seats</b> did {{not always}} fold into the bodywork. Following it, such {{optional}} passenger arrangements typically were integrated into the rear deck. When unoccupied, the remaining space, if any, under the seat's lid {{could be used for}} storing luggage.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} roadster automobiles {{had only}} basic bodies without doors, windshields, or other weather protection. By the 1920s they were appointed similarly to touring cars, with doors, windshields, simple folding tops, and side curtains. When roadsters of this era were equipped with <b>rumble</b> <b>seats,</b> the seats folded {{into the body}} when not in use.|$|R
50|$|In 1939, Plymouth {{produced}} 417,528 vehicles, {{of which}} 5,967 were two-door convertible coupes with <b>rumble</b> <b>seats.</b> The 1939 convertible coupe was prominently featured at Chrysler's {{exhibit at the}} 1939 New York World's Fair, advertised as the first mass-production convertible with a power folding top. It featured a 201 cu in, 82 hp version of the flathead six engine.|$|R
500|$|In 1988, the Alumni Association {{purchased}} a 1931 Ford Model A Roadster and restored the vehicle again in 1994. The Alumni Wreck is distinguished by its spare tire locations on the driver's side and passenger's side runningboards {{and the words}} [...] "Georgia Tech Alumni Association" [...] printed on the doors. It also has a convertible top. On the real Wreck, the spare is behind the <b>rumble</b> <b>seat</b> and the roof cannot be removed or lowered.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} AMX full-scale {{models were}} developed in 1965 by AMC's advanced styling studios {{under the direction of}} Charles Mashigan. The two-seat AMX was [...] "big hit on the auto show circuit in 1966" [...] and featured a <b>rumble</b> <b>seat</b> that opened out from the rear decklid for extra passengers called a [...] "Ramble" [...] seat. AMC executives saw the opportunity to change the consumers' perception of the automaker from Romney's economy car image, to the realities of the new marketplace interested in sporty, performance oriented vehicles. Robert B. Evans requested a car like the AMX to be put into production quickly.|$|E
60|$|A {{thousand}} sarcastic refusals did not {{check his}} teasing {{for a car}} of his own. However lax he might be about early rising and the prosody of Vergil, he was tireless in tinkering. With three other boys he bought a rheumatic Ford chassis, built an amazing racer-body out of tin and pine, went skidding round corners in the perilous craft, and sold it at a profit. Babbitt gave him a motor-cycle, and every Saturday afternoon, with seven sandwiches {{and a bottle of}} Coca-Cola in his pockets, and Eunice perched eerily on the <b>rumble</b> <b>seat,</b> he went roaring off to distant towns.|$|E
50|$|Two trim {{lines were}} offered, {{standard}} and DeLuxe, across {{a number of}} body styles including a base roadster, five-window coupe, three-window coupe, Tudor and Fordor sedans in flatback or trunkback versions, a convertible sedan, a woody station wagon, and new Model 51 truck. <b>Rumble</b> <b>seats</b> were optional on coupe model. An oil pressure gauge (costing $4) and two windshield wipers were optional. If one got the optional radio, it replaced the ash tray.|$|R
5000|$|As buyer tastes {{began to}} change in the late 1930s, certain body styles were pruned from the lineup. 1939 would be the last year for the 4-door phaeton and for single-seat coupes and {{convertibles}} (and their <b>rumble</b> <b>seats).</b> A conventional [...] "alligator" [...] hood replaced the [...] "butterfly" [...] hood with its lifting side panels. Ford also made several safety-related changes as well. The dashboard was redesigned (to feature recessed controls) in 1938, hydraulic brakes were added in 1939, and sealed-beam headlights were introduced a year later.|$|R
5000|$|Betty holds a [...] "Betty Boop Exposition", {{where she}} {{displays}} the latest modern inventions. Her creations included an ultra-streamlined car, a roadster with multiple <b>rumble</b> <b>seats</b> (for {{those with a}} large family), a multi-level baby carriage for quintuplets, and a grand piano that can change into other useful contraptions. Her final invention is her dress, which can change into a flower, a butterfly, and a high-collared gown with a train. The dress is a sensation, and soon everyone is wearing the latest Boop creation.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the 4-door body, before the war, the factory also produced a 2-door coupé with a <b>rumble</b> <b>seat,</b> dickie seat, as a convertible also with a <b>rumble</b> <b>seat,</b> dickie seat.|$|E

50|$|The exhibit {{includes}} {{a reproduction of}} the Millennium Falcons cockpit, which features a four-and-a-half minute experience about real-world space exploration, particularly the unmanned exploration of the farther planets of our solar system, and the hundreds of exoplanets that have been discovered. The experience is narrated by Anthony Daniels, who played C-3PO, and with a few added effects in the cockpit (<b>rumbling</b> <b>seats,</b> fans, and lights) is meant to simulate the appearance of actually traveling through space and looking out the cockpit viewscreen. This exhibit {{was not included in}} the version at the Powerhouse Museum.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} began {{operations in}} 1831. It was {{named in honor}} of DeWitt Clinton, the governor of New York State responsible for the Erie Canal, who died in 1828. Portions of the steam engine were cast at the West Point Foundry in Cold Spring, New York. The DeWitt Clinton's first run was from the city of Albany, New York, to Schenectady, New York, a run of 16 miles. Its passenger cars were made of stagecoach bodies in which riders would sit either inside or on outdoor <b>rumble</b> <b>seats.</b> The locomotive was scrapped in 1833. The M&H became part of the New York Central Railroad system in 1853.|$|R
5000|$|The 1936 Series 70 and 75 {{both had}} {{v-shaped}} windshield styles by Fleetwood. A narrower radiator shell {{was supported by}} the new louver style [...] "Convex vee" [...] grill. Headlights were mounted on the radiator shell. Parking lights were inside the headlights. Front fenders were new with a crease along the center line. The cowl vent was changed back to opening forward. There were built-in trunks on [...] "touring" [...] styles, town cars and 4-door convertibles. Coupes and 2-door convertibles had <b>rumble</b> <b>seats</b> plus a separate door for the spare tire at the extreme rear of the deck. All bodies now utilized the Fisher Turret Top.|$|R

5000|$|Clench's impatience and the {{unexpected}} change of plans caused the teleportation signal to be diverted through an unknown planet. As a result; a towering, winged and carnivorous alien was beamed into the tube by mistake, as chaos and confusion ensued and the technicians panicked. The creature quickly escaped, however, as intermittent darkness and {{flashes of light}} revealed the shattered and empty teleportation tube. A power outage then plunged the chamber into total darkness as guests sat helplessly restrained in their seats. A maintenance worker attempted to restore the power, but was mauled as the alien's shrieks resounded throughout the room and a spray of fluid flew out into the audience hitting the guests' faces. After the spray of fluid, the guests felt their <b>seats</b> <b>rumble</b> and shake as the alien made its way swiftly through the crowd, during which time the guests also felt the [...] "breath" [...] of the alien {{on the back of}} their necks and drool dripping from its mouth.|$|R
5000|$|Meltzer {{contemplated}} {{a career}} change during the mid-1980s, which {{led him to}} announce in 1985 {{that he would be}} ceasing publication, citing disinterest in the wrestling landscape of the time and too much time having to be spent on bookkeeping and mailing lists. At that point, he continued offering the WON on a [...] "temporary" [...] basis as an 8-page weekly on 8½ by 11 inch paper only to fill out the remainder of his subscriptions. He was to be hired to cover soccer instead and just contribute to other wrestling newsletters. The reader response to this change was apparently enough to convince him to pursue the WON as his career instead. He started writing the WON full-time in 1987, retaining the smaller 8-page format. By this point, Meltzer began making appearances at major wrestling events, at first mostly in Japan. He was seen as a spectator in the front row at Chi-Town <b>Rumble</b> in 1989, <b>seated</b> next to Brad Muster, at the time a fullback with the Chicago Bears. As kayfabe was still being observed from within the business, Jim Ross acknowledged Musters presence in the audience during the broadcast, but not Meltzers.|$|R
