Memantine succeeded in increasing place field plasticity in aged rat subjects.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The time {{course of}} {{cortical}} activations of different anatomic areas {{has been demonstrated}} to reflect, to some degree, the temporal dynamics of the brain network. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the temporal sequence of the hemodynamic response in the visual, supplemental motor (SMA), and primary motor cortical areas by using a visuomotor reaction time task. METHODS: The reaction times (RTs) of 26 right-handed subjects were recorded in response to a visual cue during an event-related functional MR imaging (fMRI) experiment. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM 99) was used, and activation maps were produced for each subject. This was followed by a random-effects group analysis. Using a weighted least-squares approach, we recorded the time at onset of the hemodynamic response of the fMRI activation in four regions of interest: the right occipital (RO) and left occipital (LO) visual cortices, the SMA, and the left sensorimotor area (LM 1). Linear regression analysis was done between the RTs and the mean latencies for the four areas. RESULTS: Using the group analysis, the results showed that the first <b>regions</b> <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> were the visual occipital cortices (RO and LO) with mean latency standard error of mean (SEM) o...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{study the}} {{mechanism}} of activation of the human thioltransferase (hTTase) gene under oxidative stress. METHODS. Human lens epithelial cells (HLE-B 3) were exposed to 0. 1 mM H 2 O 2 for 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, or 60 minutes; lysed; and used for gel mobility shift assay (GMSA) and supershift assay for activating protein (AP) - 1 transcription factor.

40|$|Cancer-associated {{mutations}} in cancer genes constitute a diverse set of mutations {{associated with the}} disease. To gain insight into features of the set, substitution, deletion and insertion mutations were analysed at the nucleotide level, from the COSMIC database. The most frequent substitutions were c -> t, g -> a, g -> t, and the most frequent codon changes were to termination codons. Deletions more than insertions, FS (frameshift) indels more than I-F (in-frame) ones, and single-nucleotide indels, were frequent. FS indels cause loss of significant fractions of proteins. The 5 '-cut in FS deletions, and 5 '-ligation in FS insertions, often occur between pairs of identical bases. Interestingly, the cut-site and 3 '-ligation in insertions, and 3 '-cut and join-pair in deletions, were each {{found to be the}} same significantly often (p < 0. 001).

40|$|Several {{regulators}} {{within the}} AraC family control {{the expression of}} genes known or thought to be required for virulence of bacterial pathogens. One of these, Rns, activates transcription from an unprecedented variety of binding-site locations. Although nearly all prokaryotic activators bind within a small region upstream and adjacent to the promoter that they regulate, Rns does not bind within this <b>region</b> <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> its own promoter, Prns. Instead, to activate Prns, Rns requires one binding site 224. 5 bp upstream and one downstream of the transcription start site.

Like Rns, other members of this group of activators positively regulate the expression of virulence factors in pathogenic bacteria. These regulators are also able to activate transcription from promoter-proximal upstream binding sites since they are able to substitute for Rns at Pcoo, a promoter with only upstream binding sites. Thus, Rns is the prototype for a group of regulators, which include CfaR, VirF, AggR, and CsvR and which activate transcription from locations that are more diverse than those of any other known activator...|$|E

40|$|We have assayed {{the ability}} of {{segments}} of the simian virus 40 (SV 40) 72 -base-pair (bp) repeat enhancer <b>region</b> <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> gene expression {{under the control of}} the SV 40 early promoter and to compete for trans-acting enhancer-binding factors of limited availability in vivo in monkey CV- 1 or human HeLa cells. The bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and the herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase genes were used as reporters in these assays. A 94 -bp sequence located between SV 40 nucleotides 179 and 272, including one copy of the 72 -bp repeat, has been termed the minimal enhancer in previous studies. In the present study, we found that the 20 -bp origin-proximal region located between nucleotides 179 and 198 was dispensable, since its removal caused only a slight reduction in enhancer activity. However, the deletion of another 4 bp up to nucleotide 202 abolished the enhancer activity. We propose that the minimal enhancer is a 74 -bp sequence located between nucleotides 199 and 272, including 52 bp of one copy of the 72 -bp repeat and a 22 -bp adjacent sequence up to the PvuII site at 272. The nonamer 5 '-AAGT/CATGCA- 3 ', which we term the K core, occurred as a tandem duplication around the SphI site at nucleotide 200, and we found that this duplication was essential for enhancement and factor-binding activities. A heterologous core element (which we term the C core), 5 '-GTGGA/TA/TA/TG- 3 ', identified earlier (G. Khoury and P. Gruss, Cell 33 : 313 - 314, 1983; Weiher et al., Science 219 : 626 - 631, 1983) also occurred in duplicate, with one of the copies located within the 22 -bp sequence near nucleotide 272 present outside the 72 -bp repeat. We provide direct evidence that this 22 -bp sequence augments enhancer activity considerably. We also found that in addition to the heterologous interaction occurring normally between the K and C cores within the minimal enhancer, certain homologous interactions were also permitted provided there was proper spacing between the elements...|$|E

40|$|Hypoxic regions (areas of {{subnormal}} oxygen levels) are {{a common}} feature with solid tumours that have reached a size of 2 - 3 mm in diameter. Such regions have characteristically responded poorly to conventional anti-cancer treatments such as radiation or chemotherapeutics. It has been previously demonstrated that the specific targeting of these cells is possible with compounds of specific properties, such as tirapazamine. This thesis describes an exploration of using transition metal complexes of cobalt(III) and copper(II) as hypoxia-selective prodrugs for use in cancer chemotherapy. The aim has been to use both the lowered pH and lowered oxygen levels found within hypoxic <b>regions</b> <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> prodrugs into their cytotoxic active form. Through doing this, the coordination chemistry of medicinally active N-oxide ligands has been expanded upon, including the first transition metal complexes of tirapazamine {{and the development of}} a novel series of heteroleptic complexes featuring an N-oxide and 2, 2 ’-dipyridylamine ligand. The solution properties of the prepared complexes and their uncoordinated ligands have been studied so that their behaviour in biological systems can be better understood. The cobalt(III) heteroleptic complexes are shown to have promise for the purpose of improving delivery of N-oxide based drugs, improving their solubility and altering their delivery and release. The complex of a tirapazamine analogue [Co(tpz-CN) (dpHa) 2] 2 + was shown to release the cytotoxic N-oxide rapidly under hypoxic conditions, but promisingly, this dissociation appears to be hindered in the presence of oxygen. In vitro cytotoxicity studies on this complex showed it to have the same IC 50 value as its N-oxide ligand, providing promise for the heteroleptic system as prodrugs. ...|$|R

Behavioral results replicated earlier findings with older adults tested in the morning better able to ignore distraction than those tested in the afternoon. Imaging results showed that time of testing modulates task-related fMRI signals in older adults and that age differences were reduced when older adults are tested at peak times of day.

40|$|AbstractPrevious {{studies have}} {{identified}} two signaling interactions regulating cardiac myogenesis in avians, a hypoblast-derived signal acting on epiblast and mediated by activin or a related molecule and an endoderm-derived signal acting on mesoderm and involving BMP- 2. In this study, experiments {{were designed to}} investigate the temporal relationship between these signaling events and the potential role of other TGFβ superfamily members in regulating early steps of heart muscle development. We find that while activin or TGFβ can potently induce cardiac myogenesis in pregastrula epiblast, they show no capacity to convert noncardiogenic mesoderm toward a myocardial phenotype. Conversely, BMP- 2 or BMP- 4, in combination with FGF- 4, can readily induce cardiac myocyte formation in posterior mesoderm, but shows no capacity to induce cardiac myogenesis in epiblast cells. Activin/TGFβ and BMP- 2 /BMP- 4 therefore have distinct and reciprocal cardiac-inducing capacities that mimic the tissues {{in which they are}} expressed, the pregastrula hypoblast and anterior lateral endoderm, respectively. Experiments with noggin and follistatin provide additional evidence indicating that BMP signaling lies downstream of an activin/TGFβ signal in the cardiac myogenesis pathway. In contrast to the cardiogenic-inducing capacities of BMP- 2 /BMP- 4 in mesoderm, however, we find that BMP- 2 or BMP- 4 inhibits cardiac myogenesis prior to stage 3, demonstrating multiple roles for BMPs in mesoderm induction. These and other published studies suggest a signaling cascade in which a hypoblast-derived activin/TGFβ signal is required prior to and during early stages of gastrulation, regulated both spatially and temporally by an interplay between BMPs and their antagonists. Later cardiogenic signals arising from endoderm, and perhaps transiently from ectoderm, and mediated in part by BMPs, act on emerging mesoderm within cardiogenic <b>regions</b> <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> or enhance expression of cardiogenic genes such as GATA and cNkx family members, leading to cardiac myocyte differentiation...|$|R
40|$|Cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) is an {{inducible}} form of COX and is overexpressed {{in diverse}} tumors, raising {{the possibility of}} a role for COX- 2 in carcinogenesis. In addition, COX- 2 contributes to angiogenesis. The Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) oncoprotein, latent membrane protein 1 (LMP 1), is detected in at least 70 % of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and all EBV-infected preinvasive nasopharyngeal lesions. We found that in specimens of LMP 1 -positive NPC, COX- 2 is frequently expressed, whereas LMP 1 -negative NPC rarely express the enzyme. We next found that expression of LMP 1 in EBV-negative nasopharyngeal epithelial cells induced COX- 2 expression. Coexpression of IκBα(S 32 A/S 36 A), which is not phosphorylated and prevents NF-κB activation, with LMP 1 showed that NF-κB is essential for induction of COX- 2 by LMP 1. We also demonstrate that NF-κB is involved in LMP 1 -induced cox- 2 promoter activity with the use of reporter assays. Two major regions of LMP 1, designated CTAR 1 and CTAR 2, are signal-transducing domains of LMP 1. Constructs expressing either CTAR 1 or CTAR 2 induce COX- 2 but to a lesser extent than wild-type LMP 1, consistent with the ability of both <b>regions</b> <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> NF-κB. Furthermore, we demonstrate that LMP 1 -induced COX- 2 is functional because LMP 1 increased production of prostaglandin E 2 in a COX- 2 -dependent manner. Finally, we demonstrate that LMP 1 increased production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Treatment of LMP 1 -expressing cells with the COX- 2 -specific inhibitor (NS- 398) dramatically decreased production of VEGF, suggesting that LMP 1 -induced VEGF production is mediated, at least in part, by COX- 2. These results suggest that COX- 2 induction by LMP 1 {{may play a role in}} angiogenesis in NPC...|$|R

The MVH assumes a central role of inhibitory intra- and inter-hemispheric connections, which appears central to the discussions of our present models.

In this project the models were tested, where the right posterior <b>regions</b> was found <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> <b>to</b> emotional face perception, irrespective of affective valence, albeit with greater activation to negative facial cues.

Unlike previous functional imaging studies of category specificity, we used a factorial design that crossed category (tools and fruits) with tasks requiring retrieval of either action or perceptual (real life size) knowledge. The presentation of tools relative to fruit increased activation in the same left posterior middle temporal area that was linked to the retrieval of action knowledge in general (for fruit as well as tools). However, we found no correlation between activation evoked by fruit and the size retrieval task. The left medial anterior temporal cortex was the only <b>region</b> <b>to</b> be <b>activated</b> for fruit relative to tools. We argue that the sensory-functional theory of category-specific effects is insufficient to account for the current neuroimaging literature. However, the data do support a more refined version of the theory: tools, relative to fruit, are more strongly linked to manipulative/motor knowledge and, for some tasks, fruit may be more reliant on integrating multiple semantic features...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a feedback framework that can improve chord recognition for music audio signals by performing approximate note transcription with Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) using prior knowledge on chords. Although {{the names and}} note compositions of chords are intrinsically linked with each other (e. g., C major chords are highly likely to include C, E, and G notes, and those notes are highly {{likely to be in}} C major chords), chord recognition and note transcription (multipitch analysis) have been studied independently. To solve this chicken-and-egg prob-lem, our framework iterates chord recognition and approximate note transcription using each other’s results. More specifically, we first perform approximate note transcription based on Bayesian NMF that forces basis spectra to respectively correspond to different semitone-level pitches covering the whole range. We then execute chord recognition based on Bayesian hidden Markov models (HMMs) that use chroma features obtained from the activation patterns of those pitches. To improve note transcription, we again perform Bayesian NMF that encourages certain kinds of pitches in each chord <b>region</b> <b>to</b> be <b>activated.</b> Experimental results showed that our feedback framework gradually improved the accuracy of chord recognition...|$|R
40|$|Inflammasomes are cytosolic multi-protein {{complexes}} that initiate immune {{responses to}} infection by recruiting and activating the Caspase- 1 protease. Human NLRP 1 {{was the first}} protein shown to form an inflammasome, but its physiological mechanism of activation remains unknown. Recently, specific variants of mouse and rat NLRP 1 were found <b>to</b> be <b>activated</b> upon N-terminal cleavage by the anthrax lethal factor protease. However, agonists for other NLRP 1 variants, including human NLRP 1, are not known, and it remains unclear if they are also activated by proteolysis. Here we demonstrate that two mouse NLRP 1 paralogs (NLRP 1 AB 6 and NLRP 1 BB 6) are also activated by N-terminal proteolytic cleavage. We also demonstrate that proteolysis within a specific N-terminal linker <b>region</b> is sufficient <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> human NLRP 1. Evolutionary analysis of primate NLRP 1 shows the linker/cleavage region has evolved under positive selection, indicative of pathogen-induced selective pressure. Collectively, these results identify proteolysis as a general mechanism of NLRP 1 inflammasome activation {{that appears to be}} contributing to the rapid evolution of NLRP 1 in rodents and primates...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMigration {{disorders}} cause neurons {{to differentiate}} in an abnormal heterotopic position. Although significant insights have been gained into {{the etiology of}} these disorders, very {{little is known about}} the anatomy of heterotopias. We have studied heterotopic masses arising in the hippocampal CA 1 region after prenatal treatment with methylazoxymethanol (MAM) in rats. Heterotopic cells were phenotypically similar to neocortical supragranular neurons and exhibited the same temporal profile of migration and neurogenesis. However, they did not express molecules characteristic of CA 1 neurons such as the limbic-associated membrane protein. Horseradish peroxidase injections in heterotopia demonstrated labeled fibers not only in the neocortex and white matter but also in the CA 1 stratum radiatum and stratum lacunosum. To study the pathophysiological consequences of this connectivity, we compared the effects of neocortical and limbic seizures on the expression of Fos protein and on cell death in MAM animals. After metrazol-induced seizures, Fos-positive cells were present in CA 1 heterotopias, the only hippocampal <b>region</b> <b>to</b> be <b>activated</b> with the neocortex. By contrast, kainic acid-induced seizures caused a prominent delayed cell death in limbic regions and in CA 1 heterotopias. Together, these results suggest that neocortical heterotopias in the CA 1 region are integrated in both the hippocampal and neocortical circuitry...|$|R
40|$|CUG-BP and ETR- 3 like factor (CELF) {{proteins}} are regulators of pre-mRNA alternative splicing. We {{created a}} series of truncation mutants <b>to</b> identify the <b>regions</b> of CELF proteins that are required <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> and <b>to</b> repress alternative splicing of different exons. This analysis was performed in parallel on two CELF proteins, ETR- 3 (CUG-BP 2, NAPOR, BRUNOL 3) and CELF 4 (BRUNOL 4). We identified a 20 -residue region of CELF 4 required for repression or activation, in contrast to ETR- 3, for which the required residues are more disperse. For both ETR- 3 and CELF 4, distinct <b>regions</b> were required <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> splicing of two different alternative exons, while regions required for repression of an additional third exon overlapped with regions required for activation. Our results suggest that activation of different splicing events by individual CELF proteins requires separable regions, implying {{the nature of the}} protein–protein interactions required for activation are target-dependent. The finding that residues required for activation and repression overlap suggests either that the same region interacts with different proteins to mediate different effects or that interactions with the same proteins can have different effects on splicing due to yet-to-be defined downstream events. These results provide a foundation for identifying CELF-interacting proteins involved in activated and/or repressed splicing...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBroadly {{neutralizing}} antibodies (bNAb) {{that target}} a conserved region of a viral antigen hold significant therapeutic promise. CR 8020 is a bNAb that targets the stem region of influenza A virus (IAV) hemagglutinin (HA). CR 8020 {{is currently being}} evaluated for prophylactic use against group 2 IAVs in phase II studies. Structural and computational analyses reported here indicate that CR 8020 targets HA residues that are prone to antigenic drift and host selection pressure. Critically, CR 8020 escape mutation is seen in certain H 7 N 9 viruses from recent outbreaks. Furthermore, {{the ability of the}} bNAb Fc <b>region</b> <b>to</b> effectively engage <b>activating</b> Fcγ receptors (FCγR) is essential for antibody efficacy. In this regard, our data indicate that the membrane could sterically hinder the formation of HA-CR 8020 -FcγRIIa/HA-IgG-FcγRIIIa ternary complexes. Altogether, our analyses suggest that epitope mutability and accessibility to immune complex assembly are important attributes to consider when evaluating bNAb candidates for clinical development...|$|R
