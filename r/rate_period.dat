The enzyme produces product at an initial rate that is approximately linear {{for a short}} period after the start of the reaction.

5000|$|In some {{products}} having {{a relatively high}} initial moisture content, an initial linear reduction of the average product moisture content {{as a function of}} time may be observed for a limited time, often known as a [...] "constant drying rate period". Usually, in this period, it is surface moisture outside individual particles that is being removed. The drying rate during this period is mostly dependent on the rate of heat transfer to the material being dried. Therefore, the maximum achievable drying rate is considered to be heat-transfer limited. If drying is continued, the slope of the curve, the drying rate, becomes less steep (falling <b>rate</b> <b>period)</b> and eventually tends to nearly horizontal at very long times. The product moisture content is then constant at the [...] "equilibrium moisture content", where it is, in practice, in equilibrium with the dehydrating medium. In the falling-rate period, water migration from the product interior to the surface is mostly by molecular diffusion, i,e. the water flux is proportional to the moisture content gradient. This means that water moves from zones with higher moisture content to zones with lower values, a phenomenon explained by the second law of thermodynamics. If water removal is considerable, the products usually undergo shrinkage and deformation, except in a well-designed freeze-drying process. The drying rate in the falling-rate period is controlled by the rate of removal of moisture or solvent from the interior of the solid being dried and is referred to as being [...] "mass-transfer limited". This is widely noticed in hygroscopic products such as fruits and vegetables, where drying occurs in the falling <b>rate</b> <b>period</b> with the constant drying <b>rate</b> <b>period</b> said to be negligible.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} model for item {{lifetime}} is the bathtub curve, {{a plot of}} the varying failure rate {{as a function of}} time.

The middle portion of the bathtub, or 'useful life', is a slightly inclined, nearly constant failure <b>rate</b> <b>period</b> where the consumer enjoys the benefit conferred by the product. As the time increases further, the curve reaches a period of increasing failures, modeling the product's wearout phase.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the stability of rater severity over an extended <b>rating</b> <b>period.</b> Multifaceted Rasch analysis was applied to ratings of writing performances of 8, 285 primary school (elementary) students. Each performance was rated on two performance dimensions by two trained raters over a <b>period</b> of 7 <b>rating</b> days. Performances rated on the first day were rerated {{at the end of the}} <b>rating</b> <b>period.</b> Statistically significant differences between raters were found within each day and in all days combined. Daily measures of the relative severity of individual rates were found not to be invariant when compared to single, on-average measures for the whole <b>rating</b> <b>period.</b> For more than half of the raters, severity measures on the last day were significantly different from measures on the first day. These findings must cast doubt on the practice of using a single calibration of rater severity as the basis for adjustment of person measures. (Contains 8 figures, 12 tables, and 31 references.)

5000|$|Application {{of hot air}} (convective {{or direct}} drying). Air heating {{increases}} the driving force for heat transfer and accelerates drying. It also reduces air relative humidity, further increasing the driving force for drying. In the falling <b>rate</b> <b>period,</b> as moisture content falls, the solids heat up and the higher temperatures speed up diffusion {{of water from the}} interior of the solid to the surface. However, product quality considerations limit the applicable rise to air temperature. Excessively hot air can almost completely dehydrate the solid surface, so that its pores shrink and almost close, leading to crust formation or [...] "case hardening", which is usually undesirable. For instance in wood (timber) drying, air is heated (which speeds up drying) though some steam is also added to it (which hinders drying rate to a certain extent) in order to avoid excessive surface dehydration and product deformation owing to high moisture gradients across timber thickness. Spray drying belongs in this category.|$|E
