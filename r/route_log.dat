5|$|In the {{original}} plan for the U.S. Highway System, as approved by the Bureau of Public Roads in November 1926, US7 was defined as beginning in New York City and designated on the alignment of NY22 to Amenia, where it shifted northeast into Sharon, Connecticut to use old New England Route4 through Massachusetts and Vermont {{all the way to}} the Canadian border. Apparently New York State did not approve this plan, and by mid-1927 the official <b>route</b> <b>log</b> published by AASHO (now known as AASHTO) had been amended so that the southern end of US7 began in Norwalk, Connecticut instead.|$|E

25|$|Although NY840 {{is signed}} as an east–west route, the {{reference}} markers along NY840 are sequenced from the arterial concurrency northward, ending at the Halsey Road intersection, {{in violation of}} standard New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) practice. NYSDOT also lists the mileposts along the route {{from east to west}} in its annual Traffic Volume Report, implying a north–south orientation; however, NY840 is listed as an east–west route in the NYSDOT <b>route</b> <b>log,</b> listing its beginning terminus at CR40 (Judd Road, now CR840).|$|E
50|$|Although {{the route}} follows a {{generally}} east-west alignment {{for most of}} its length, Kentucky Transportation Cabinet <b>route</b> <b>logs</b> list the <b>route</b> as north-south.|$|R
50|$|Finally, on April 15, 2012, Mn/DOT and Aitkin County {{finalized}} {{an agreement}} to transfer the road to county control. Despite the agreement, MN 232 continued {{to be present in}} Mn/DOT <b>route</b> <b>logs</b> as recently as February 2013, but it was finally removed from the November 2013 release.|$|R
50|$|The New Mexico Department of Transportation {{has removed}} US 85 from its <b>route</b> <b>logs,</b> but the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) retains US 85 on a {{concurrent}} alignment with I-10 and I-25 to maintain continuity with signed segments in Texas and Colorado.|$|R
500|$|The {{official}} <b>route</b> <b>log,</b> last {{published by}} AASHTO in 1989, {{has been named}} United States Numbered Highways since its initial publication in 1926. [...] Within the <b>route</b> <b>log,</b> [...] "U.S. Route" [...] {{is used in the}} table of contents, while [...] "United States Highway" [...] appears as the heading for each route. [...] All reports of the Special Committee on Route Numbering since 1989 use [...] "U.S. Route", and federal laws relating to highways use [...] "United States Route" [...] or [...] "U.S. Route" [...] more often than the [...] "Highway" [...] variants. [...] The use of U.S. Route or U.S. Highway on a local level depends on the state, with some states such as Delaware using [...] "route" [...] and others such as Colorado using [...] "highway".|$|E
500|$|With 32states already marking their routes, {{the plan}} was {{approved}} by AASHO on November 11, 1926. [...] This plan included a number of directionally split routes, several discontinuous routes (including US6, US19 and US50), and some termini at state lines. [...] By the time the first <b>route</b> <b>log</b> was published in April 1927, major numbering changes {{had been made in}} Pennsylvania in order to align the routes to the existing auto trails. In addition, U.S. Route 15 had been extended across Virginia.|$|E
500|$|Interstate 296 (I-296) {{is a part}} of the Interstate Highway System in the US {{state of}} Michigan. It is a state {{trunkline}} highway that runs for [...] entirely within the Grand Rapids area. Its termini are I-96 on the north side of Grand Rapids in Walker and I-196 near downtown Grand Rapids. For most of its length, the Interstate is concurrent with U.S. Highway 131 (US131), which continues as a freeway built to Interstate Highway standards north and south of the shorter I-296. The highway was first proposed in the late 1950s and opened in December 1962, but the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) has since eliminated all signage for I-296 and removed the designation from their official state map. The designation is therefore unsigned, but still listed on the Interstate Highway System <b>route</b> <b>log</b> maintained by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).|$|E
50|$|New York's {{system is}} similar to California's postmile system in {{maintaining}} the state's highways and <b>route</b> <b>logs.</b> The New York State Thruway Authority adopted its own reference system for the New York State Thruway system, including I-287 and I-84. There is a similar reference marker system in use in neighboring Vermont.|$|R
50|$|State Route 5A {{was a short}} 2.1 mi loop off Route 5 in Lovell. It {{functioned as}} an eastern bypass of {{downtown}} and connected to SR 5 at both ends. It was designated in 1960 and {{was removed from the}} <b>route</b> <b>logs</b> in 2003. It is now an unnumbered road.|$|R
50|$|SR 159 {{begins in}} the west at Shin Pond Village in the {{northwest}} corner of Mt. Chase, on Shin Pond Road about 10 mi northwest of SR 11. <b>Route</b> <b>logs</b> do not indicate a specific intersection for the terminus, which is located between the intersections of Black Point Road and Grand Lake / Snowshoe Roads.|$|R
500|$|What is now NY293 was {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} NY37, an east–west highway extending from Monroe to the Connecticut state line near Brewster over most of modern US6, in the mid-1920s. In 1927, the first <b>route</b> <b>log</b> of the U.S. Highway System published by AASHO placed US6 on what is now US209 from Port Jervis to Kingston within New York. At the time, the US6 designation ended in Kingston and resumed at the Connecticut state line in Danbury. The gap in the designation was eliminated in 1928 when US6 was realigned east of Port Jervis to follow most of its modern alignment; however, from Woodbury to the Bear Mountain Bridge, US6 followed what had been NY37 from Central Valley to Highlands and overlapped with US9W south from Highlands to the bridge. US6 was realigned [...] to bypass West Point to the south while its former routing through the academy grounds was redesignated as NY293.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1970s, MDOT {{took part}} in a FHWA-backed {{initiative}} called the Positive Guidance Demonstration Project, and the two agencies audited signage practices {{in the vicinity of the}} I-96/M-37 and I-296/US131 interchange in Walker. MDOT determined that usage of the I-296 designation was [...] "a potential source of confusion for motorists." [...] FHWA agreed with the department's proposal to eliminate all signage and public map references to the designation in April 1979. MDOT then petitioned the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) on June 22, 1979, for their permission to make the change, saying [...] "it is felt that the I-296 designation serves no useful purpose other than to designate an Interstate routing." [...] AASHTO approved the request on October 13. On October 24 that year, MDOT also requested formal permission from the FHWA to remove all signage and map references to I-296. The FHWA granted permission on December 3, 1979, on the condition that MDOT would continue to use the designation on official documents. The approval explicitly retained the highway in the Interstate system for funding and other purposes. The last state map to show the I-296 designation was published in 1979, as the 1980 map lacks any reference to the designation. Other maps, like the one published by the Kent County Road Commission, occasionally show I-296, and FHWA includes the designation in their <b>Route</b> <b>Log</b> and Finder List for the Interstate Highway System.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{when the}} state {{transportation}} bond proposed by the Legislature in 1972 failed, {{the construction of the}} Route74 Freeway seemed inevitable. In 1975, the Tri-State Transportation Commission gave the pitch of attempting Route74 one last time, citing that it would [...] "help serve planned industrial and residential concentrations". The Commission's report cited that the route is started soon, could be constructed by 2000. However, by the early 1980s, the commission had dropped the route from their focus, and despite no route ever being constructed, Route74, along with Route60 and Route85, remain in the state's unofficial <b>Route</b> <b>Log</b> in the state statutes.|$|E
50|$|Kentucky Route 842 is a 7.4 mi {{state highway}} in Kentucky. Although listed as an east - west route in Kentucky Transportation Cabinet <b>route</b> <b>logs,</b> KY 842 follows a north - south arc between its termini. The {{southern}} terminus {{of the route}} is at U.S. Route 25 in Florence. The northern terminus is at KY 236 in Erlanger.|$|R
50|$|The signed eastern {{terminus}} of SR 25 {{is at the}} end of Deering Avenue at Park Street (SR 22). However, state <b>route</b> <b>logs</b> indicate SR 25 continuing along SR 22 {{to terminate}} at State Street (SR 77). Both SR 22 and SR 25 officially terminate at SR 77, but SR 25 is not signed at the intersection.|$|R

50|$|According to the AASHTO <b>route</b> <b>log,</b> the {{southern}} terminus of US 3 {{is at the}} junction of Route 2A and Route 3 in Cambridge, which is where Route 2A crosses the Charles along the Harvard Bridge (also known as the Massachusetts Avenue Bridge). This is a change from AASHTO's 1989 <b>Route</b> <b>Log</b> which placed the terminus at US 20 in Boston, where Route 2 currently meets US 20 after crossing the Charles River at the Boston University Bridge. This was where US 3 met US 1 until that highway was re-routed in 1971.|$|E
50|$|Some {{confusion}} exists {{over the}} western terminus. The state <b>route</b> <b>logs</b> {{show that the}} end of the road is at the junction with Ferry Street (New Hampshire Route 111) in Hudson. Local signage shows NH 102 continuing along NH 111 as a concurrency over the Hudson Bridge into Nashua. Signage on the bridge indicates NH 102 sharing East Hollis Street with NH 111.|$|R
