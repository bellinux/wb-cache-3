Although conditions that minimize dose from radioactive Tc impurities have been identified, 5 cyclotron performance and thus irradiation conditions may randomly fluctuate between and/or during production runs. Fluctuations of certain parameters, for example the total number of bombarding protons, are expected to have little influence on <b>radionuclidic</b> <b>purity,</b> whereas fluctuations in beam energy, target thickness and isotopic composition may dramatically affect the relative amounts of 93 gTc, 94 gTc, 95 gTc, and 96 gTc impurities.

40|$|Few PET {{isotopes}} {{are suitable}} for antibody labelling since immunoPET requires that the PET isotope can {{be attached to the}} mAb with high in-vivo stability and the decay half-life of the isotope should match the pharmacokinetics of the mAb (Phelps 2004). Both 124 I (t½ = 4. 2 d) and 89 Zr (t½ = 3. 3 d) have a near ideal half-life for anti-body-based imaging, but there are several ad-vantages of using 89 Zr over 124 I. For 124 I, the high energy of its positrons (2. 13 MeV), results in a relatively low PET image resolution and the possible dehalogenation in vivo can lead to significant radioactivity uptake in non-targeted organs. In comparison, for 89 Zr the low energy of its positron (395. 5 keV), results in a PET images with a higher spatial resolution and furthermore, 89 Zr is a residualizing isotope, which is trapped inside the target cell after internalization of the mAb. One disadvantage of 89 Zr is its abundant high energy gamma-ray (909 keV), which may limit the radioactive dose that can be administered to the patients. The most popular reaction to produce 89 Zr is the 89 Y(p,n) 89 Zr nuclear reaction (Sahar et al., 1966; Link et al., 1986). A proton beam with 14 - 16 MeV energy is used to bombard inexpensive high-purity 89 Y metal target (99. 9 %), avoiding cumbersome recycling of the target material. The yttrium targets could be either a foil (Dejesus and Nickels, 1990), sputtered onto a copper support (Meijs et al., 1994) or Y 2 O 3 pellets (S. A. Kandil, B. Scholten, 2007). Although 89 Zr is currently commercially available, its price is prohibitive for routine clinical applications of 89 Zr immuno-PET. The motivation of the present work was the fully automated production of small quantities of 89 Zr using commercially available automated systems. We also describe a newly designed and tested platinum cradle, capable of holding a metallic foil and being directly transferable/compatible between the IBA NIRTA target and IBA Pinctada Metal dissolution/purification module. Material and Methods The solid target infrastructure used for 89 Zr production was identical to the implementation reported earlier for production of 64 Cu and 124 I (S. Poniger et al. 2012). The commercially avail-able Nirta Solid Target from IBA was coupled to our 18 / 9 IBA cyclotron using a 2 -meter external beam line. A fully automated pneumatic solid target transfer system (STTS) designed by TEMA Sinergie was used to deliver the irradiated tar-gets to a dedicated hotcell. The newly designed platinum cradle holding the yttrium foil (0. 127 mm thick, 8 mm d) is shown in FIG. 1. Typical irradiation parameters were 14. 9 MeV at 20 μA for 1. 5 hours (90 o angle of incidence). The irradiated cradle, containing the 89 Zr target is then loaded directly into the IBA Pinctada Metal module (see FIG. 2) for dissolution/purification without disassembly. We used the dissolution/purification method described by Holland et al. 2009, without modification (Purification of 89 Zr from 89 Y, 88 Y and other radionuclidic impurities using a hydroxamate column, with 89 Zr eluted with 1. 0 M Oxalic acid). <b>Radionuclidic</b> <b>purities</b> were evaluated by gamma spectroscopy and traces of metallic impurities were determined by ICP-MS.

Recently, 67 Ga-labeled acetylacetate bis(thiosemicarbazones) (67 Ga-AATS) complex with significant tumor accumulation and fast blood clearance has been employed. Materials and Methods In this study, the absorbed dose of 67 Ga-AATS in each human organ was evaluated and compared with 67 Ga-citrate as the most commonly used form of 67 Ga in nuclear medicine. 67 Ga was produced via 68 Zn(p, 2 n) 67 Ga reaction at 30 MeV cyclotron. Moreover, 67 Ga-AATS was produced by adding 50 µl of AATS to absolute ethanol (1 mg/ml) in a gallium-containing vial at 80 - 90 °C. The absorbed dose of each human organ was calculated, using RADAR method, based on biodistribution data in Wistar rats.

40|$|Introduction In {{the past}} several years there has been a growing {{interest}} in the development of radiopharmaceuticals labeled with metallic radionuclides (Anderson et al. 1999). Of particular interest is the positron emitter Cu- 64 (t½ = 12. 7 h) for molecular imaging of small molecules as well as peptides and antibodies (Smith 2004). This has led us to the recent implementation of a solid target production facility using commercially available target irradiation station and chemistry modules. Routine production of Cu- 64 was achieved with an average production yield of 0. 32 mCi/μAh, however purification of Cu- 64 has proven to be problematic; with several metallic contaminants compromising subsequent radiolabeling. We report in this work, the step by step procedure which led us to the successful production of low metal contaminant 64 Cu with high specific activity and high labeling efficiency. Material and Methods Detailed implementation of our solid target was reported earlier (Poniger et al. 2012). A Nirta Solid Target from IBA was coupled to our 18 / 9 cyclotron using a 2 -meter external beam line. A pneumatic solid target transfer system (STTS) designed by TEMA was use to deliver the irradiated target disks to a dedicated hotcell. Modules from IBA (Pinctada metal) were used for electroplating 64 Ni onto a Ag disk and for acid dissolution and purification of the irradiated target. Typical irradiation parameters were 14. 9 MeV at 35 μA for 5 – 6 hours with 64 Ni plating’s ranging from 10 – 60 μm thickness at 6 – 12 mm. <b>Radionuclidic</b> <b>purities</b> were evaluated by gamma spectroscopy and traces of metallic impurities were determined by ICP-MS or ICP-AES. Labeling efficiency was evaluated by measuring the amount of 64 Cu uptake per 20 μg of scFv-cage. Results and Conclusion Initial 64 Cu purifications following the manufacturers recommended method resulted in high levels of Cu, Fe and Zn metal contaminants (see TABLE 1, ID 1). Note that little Ag contamination is observed nevertheless the 64 Ni is plated directly on a Ag disk. After several productions, visual inspection of the module quickly revealed that the heater block used for heating the back of the Ag target disk was heavily corroded. Replacing the copper heater block with a PEEK heater block drastically reduced the levels of Cu and Fe contaminants. Unfortunately unusually high levels of Zn were still observed regardless of the stringent conditions and ultrapure reagents used during the processing (see TABLE 1, ID 5). In our quest for answers, ICP-MS analysis of the 64 Ni plating solution as well as critical stock reagents such as Milli-Q water (18 MΩ cm− 1) and 30 % HCl TraceSelect Ultra (Sigma) was performed (see TABLE 1, ID 2, 3, 4). The results were surprising, with high level of Zn found not only in the 64 Ni plating solution, but as well in the HCl TraceSelect Ultra. It was hypothesized that the Pinctada’s glass bottles (Kay, 2004) used to store the reagents, especially concentrated acidic solutions were the source of Zn contamination and all glass bottles were replaced by LDPE or PFA types. Our hypothesis was confirmed by subsequent ICP-MS analysis of fresh samples of HCl TraceSelect Ultra and the 64 Ni plating solution prepared/stored in plastic containers (see TABLE 1, ID 6, 7). We also confirmed by ICP-MS analysis that no contamination occurred when performing a non-radioactive dissolution/purification sequence on the Pinctada module using a blank PTFE target disk in conjunction with the change to plastic reagent storage bottles (see TABLE 1, ID 8). Initially the purification protocol was modified as described by Ometakova et al., 2012 to help reduce the co-elution of Zn contaminants with the 64 Cu from the AG 1 -X 8 resin. This change resulted in a significant amount of 64 Cu eluting from the resin during the resin washing steps, so that protocol was abandoned and the protocol as described by Thieme et al., 2012 was adopted. By modifying the AG 1 -X 8 resin washing protocol to this new method and eluting the 64 Cu from with 0. 1 M HCl rather than Milli-Q water (see TABLE 1, ID 9), we were able to further reduce metal contaminants, especially Zn. During the course of these experiments, the true specific activity of 64 Cu increased from as low as 12 mCi/μmol of Cu (n = 2, TABLE 1, ID 1) to 649 mCi/μmol of Cu (n = 7, TABLE 1, ID 5) and finally to 4412 mCi/μmol of Cu (n = 3, TABLE 1, ID 9). In the same time, the effective specific activity increased from 0. 03 ± 0. 02 mCi per 20 μg of scFv-cage, to 3. 7 ± 0. 3 mCi per 20 g of scFv-cage with 64 Cu. In conclusion, a significant reduction in Cu, Fe and Zn contaminants was achieved when processing 64 Cu using the Pinctada module: i) after replacement of the Cu heater block; ii) after elimination of glass reagent storage containers from the Pinctada module and procedures during preparation of the 64 Ni plating solution and iii) after implementation of a new purification protocol (Thieme et al. 2012). Introduction of a 6 M HCl wash-up cycle of the module prior to the dissolution procedure was also effective. However in recent 64 Cu productions slightly elevated Ag levels have been observed and are under investigation (see TABLE 1, ID 9) ...|$|R

METHODS: Human EGF (hEGF) was derivatized with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and then purified by size-exclusion chromatography and ultrafiltration. Kits were prepared by dispensing 0. 25 mg (1 mL) of DTPA-hEGF in 1 mol/L sodium acetate buffer [pH 6. 0] into single-dose glass vials. Raw materials were pharmacopoieal or reagent grade according to the American Chemical Society and were tested for identity and purity. Kits were tested for protein concentration, purity and homogeneity (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography), pH, clarity and color, volume, DTPA substitution, labeling efficiency, receptor binding to MDA-MB- 468 human breast cancer cells, and sterility and apyrogenicity.

The batch yield of Pt- 193 m achieved was about 10 MBq with a specific activity of 1 GBq/mu g Pt. Both the batch yield and the specific activity could be appreciably increased through improved targetry. A comparison of the cyclotron and reactor production routes of Pt- 193 m shows that the (n, gamma) reaction leads to high production yields but the alpha-particle induced reaction results in a product of higher <b>radionuclidic</b> <b>purity</b> and four orders of magnitude higher specific activity of Pt- 193 m...|$|E

The generator column can rapidly be eluted with a high yield in a volume of 1 mL to afford an eluate with largely acceptable <b>radionuclidic</b> <b>purity.</b> Collection of the eluate in a labelling kit which contains the PTSM ligand in an appropriate buffer allows to obtain in less than 30 s a highly pure 62 Cu-PTSM preparation that can be injected intravenously...|$|E

Excitation {{functions}} and production rates are presented for various Ce and Pr radionuclides {{formed in the}} bombardment of 141 Pr, natLa and natCe with protons. Extensive measure- ments were performed for 141 Pr + p up to 100 MeV and for natLa + p up to 20 MeV. The possibility is investigated to utilize tandem targetry {{for the production of}} no-carrier-added 139 Ce of high <b>radionuclidic</b> <b>purity,</b> having a Pr target in the higher energy slot followed by a La target in a lower energy slot. 141 Pr(p, 3 n) 139 mNd! 139 Pr is investigated as an al- ternative to the direct production route 140 Ce(p, 2 n) 139 Pr for producing no-carrier-added 139 Pr of high <b>radionuclidic</b> <b>purity.</b> The advantages and disadvantages of both production routes are discussed. The simultaneous production of 139 Pr and 140 Nd using Pr as target is also investigated. Experimental thick-target production rates are presented for Pr ra- dionuclides formed in the bombardment of natCe with protons at incident energies of 20, 26 and 32 MeV. All the experimental excitation functions obtained in this work are compared with theoretical predictions by means of the geometry-dependent hybrid (GDH) model as implemented in the code ALICE-IPPE. The results of this work are also compared with previous literature experimental data, if available...|$|E

The product was compared with regard to yield and <b>radionuclidic</b> <b>purity.</b> The chemical separation of 47 Sc was optimized {{in order to obtain}} a product of sufficient quality determined by labeling experiments using DOTANOC. Finally, preclinical SPECT/CT experiments were performed in tumor-bearing mice and compared with the PET image of the 44 Sc labeled counterpart.|$|E

30|$|The {{half-life}} {{found for}} the decay of the eluate {{on the first day}} after elution (dose calibrator) reproduces the reported half-life of 68 Ga very well, while later, the decay of the long-lived component follows with the half-life of 68 Ge. This is a first indication of a high <b>radionuclidic</b> <b>purity</b> which is proven in detail for longer-lived nuclides via gamma-ray spectrometry carried out after decay of the primarily eluted 68 Ga. Hence, as further radionuclidic impurities can largely be excluded, the requirements of the European Pharmacopeia concerning the radionuclide purity for 68 Ga of 99.9 % is most probably fulfilled [18],[19].|$|E
40|$|With the {{increased}} use of beta-emitting radiophar-maceuticals in nuclear medicine, a greater potential for inadvertent errors in labeling and identification of radiopharmaceuticals exists. The use of shorter half-life radiopharmaceuticals has increased the need for adequate quality-control measures within radio-pharmacy. <b>Radionuclidic</b> <b>purity</b> tests of gamma-emitting radiopharmaceuticals have received consid erable stature using gamma spectroscopy. However, there exists a need for a relatively simple radionu-clidic purity test for beta-emitting radiopharmaceu ticals (7). Some widely used radiopharmaceuticals include the following beta-emitting radionuclides, 3 H, 14 C, 32 P, 35 S, 36 C 1, 45 Ca, 63 Ni, 64 Cu, and 85 Kr. Existin...|$|E

The conventional stacked-foil technique was used and the needed thin samples were prepared by sedimentation. Irradiations were done at three cyclotrons: CV 28 and injector of COSY at Forschungszentrum Jülich, and Separate Sector Cyclotron at iThemba LABS, Somerset West. The radioactivity was measured via high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometry. The measured cross section data were compared with the literature data {{as well as with the}} nuclear model calculations. In both cases, the results generally agree but there are discrepancies in some areas, the results of nuclear model calculation and some of the literature data being somewhat higher than our data. The integral yields of the four radionuclides were calculated from the measured excitation functions. The beta(+) emitting nuclide (72) As (T(1 / 2) = 26. 01 h) can be produced with reasonable <b>radionuclidic</b> <b>purity</b> ((71) As impurity: 8 MeV; the yield of 93 MBq/microAh is, however, low.
