Three main problems are identified: (1) data from 122 IFA opinions issued between 2008 and 2010 in connection with takeover offers of Singapore-listed companies show {{that there are a}} significant number of IFAs who do not use the standard of “fair and reasonable” in assessing offers and instead use tests that are more equivocal, rendering the opinions less helpful; (2) IFAs remain subject to inherent bias and such bias is not easily detectable due to with their wide discretion in choosing appropriate assumptions and methodologies; and (3) {{there are a number of}} limitations faced by shareholders and investors in bringing common law or statutory claims against IFAs for failings in care and expertise, honesty or independence for opinions issued in takeover documentation.

40|$|The Comprehensive Environmental, Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) {{provides}} {{three distinct}} “private” causes {{of action that}} allow parties to recover {{all or part of}} their cleanup costs from “potentially responsible parties. ” Section 107 (a) (4) (B) provides a “direct” <b>right</b> <b>of</b> cost <b>recovery.</b> Sections 113 (f) (1) and 113 (f) (3) (B) provide a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> contribution following a CERCLA civil action or certain judicial or administrative settlements. The relationship among these causes of action has been the source of considerable confusion. Two Supreme Court cases, Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc. and United States v. Atlantic Research Corp. have identified certain situations in which the causes of action exclusively apply, but the Court has left considerable confusion about the appropriate cause or causes of action {{in a number of other}} common situations. These include situations in which costs are directly incurred as an obligation under an administrative settlement or following a CERCLA civil action. This Article provides a rational approach to allocating <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> cost <b>recovery</b> among sections 107 (a), 113 (f) (1), and 113 (f) (3) (B) that is consistent both with the language of CERCLA and the Supreme Court’s analysis in Cooper and Atlantic Research. First, the Article evaluates the rather unsatisfying rationales asserted by the U. S. courts of appeals for determining whether the causes of action under 107 (a) and 113 (f) are mutually exclusive. The Article suggests that the proper resolution focuses on whether there is textual overlap among the sections. Quite simply, in the event of textual overlap, standard canons of construction and the express text of section 113 (f) (3) (B), not discussed by any of the courts of appeals, suggest that 113 (f) provides the exclusive cause of action for cost recovery under CERCLA. Second, the Article evaluates the textual scope of the causes of action and whether costs incurred in a variety of common situations thus fall within the scope of 107 (a) (4) (B) or 113 (f). Both the specific text and the Supreme Court’s approach, particularly its focus on the “traditional” meaning of contribution, can help resolve these issues. The result of this analysis is a straightforward application of the statute that results in a consistent and coherent structure to CERCLA that both provides incentives for cleanup and helps ensure that the polluter pays...|$|R

[...] And for judges to rest their interpretation of statutes on nothing but their own conceptions of [...] "morals" [...] and [...] "ethics" [...] is, to say the least, dangerous business.If the present case compelled consideration of the morals and ethics of contributory infringement, I should be most reluctant to conclude that the scales of moral value are weighted against the right of producers to sell their unpatented goods in a free market. At least since Adam Smith wrote, unhampered competition has not generally been considered immoral. While there have been objections to the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, few if any of the objectors have questioned its morality.It has long been recognized that a socially undesirable practice may seek acceptance under the guise of conventional moral symbols. And repeated judicial assertion that a bad practice is hallowed by morals may, if unchallenged, help it to receive the acceptance which it seeks. With this in mind, I wish to make explicit my protest against talking about the judicial doctrine of [...] "contributory infringement" [...] as though it were entitled to the same respect as a universally recognized moral truth.|$|E
5000|$|The {{decision}} {{which is}} reported {{under the name}} Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Lincoln CC actually represents four co-joined appeals.

The House of Lords unanimously held that the old rule that a mistake of law did not {{give rise to a}} <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> should no longer be applied. However, the five Law Lords then disagreed as to what the effect should be where the understanding of the law is changed by judicial pronouncement. When judges express an opinion on the common law, as noted by Lord Browne-Wilkinson, [...] "The theoretical position has been that judges do not make or change law: they discover and declare the law which is throughout the same. According to this theory, when an earlier decision is overruled the law is not changed: its true nature is disclosed, having existed in that form all along." [...] He then added: [...] "This theoretical position is, as Lord Reid said, a fairy tale in which no-one any longer believes. In truth, judges make and change the law." [...] Accordingly, in the view of Lord Browne-Wilkinson [...] "although the decision in Hazell is retrospective in its effect, retrospection cannot falsify history: if at the date of each payment it was settled law that local authorities had capacity to enter into swap contracts, Kleinworts were not labouring under any mistake of law at that date. The subsequent decision in Hazell could not create a mistake where no mistake existed at the time." ...|$|E

On the other hand, that argument of principle is not blocked by Gregg, or other cases in the line of precedent consolidated in that decision.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to extend {{thinking}} on service recovery processes and satisfaction with service recovery, using multi-dimensional consumer outcomes. The objective of the work was to propose that satisfaction with service recovery should be based on customers 2 ̆ 7 expectations <b>of</b> the <b>recovery</b> encounter, which would be shaped by their expectations of “non-failed” encounters. Design/methodology/approach – The paper adopts a theoretical approach. Using the existing service recovery literature as well as the traditional services literature, the conceptual framework and associated research propositions are developed. Findings – The proposed framework suggests that service recovery is a service encounter it its own <b>right.</b> The effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> encounters will be based on how encounters operate relative to customer expectations and experiences with regard to the recovery activity. Research limitations/implications – The research propositions and proposed framework need further empirical investigation. Practical implications – The proposed framework suggests that managing service recovery should be undertaken in a similar fashion to managing any service, and thus managers need to understand customers 2 ̆ 7 recovery expectations. Organisations also need to consider how a recovery action impacts on a range of customer outcomes, as focusing on one aspect will not capture consumers 2 ̆ 7 full set of behaviours. Originality/value – The proposed model identifies that service recovery should be evaluated with regard to consumers 2 ̆ 7 recovery expectations and satisfaction is not based on expectations with regard to non-failed encounters. <br /...|$|R

In England the [...] "appellant" [...] first formulated his charge, which was proclaimed at five successive county courts. If the [...] "appellee" [...] did not appear he was outlawed; if he did he could plead various exemptions; and unless the court upheld them he was obliged to offer battle by throwing down his glove as gage. When an ordinary court ordered the battle, it was fought on foot with staves and leather shields; but when a court of chivalry' ordered it, on horse with spear and sword. If defeated, the appellee was liable to sentence of death by hanging, and an undecided fight still left him liable, though acquitted on the appeal, to trial by indictment; if the appellant yielded, the appellee was free. The <b>right</b> <b>of</b> [...] "wager of battle" [...] was claimed as late as 1818 by a man named Thornton, who had been acquitted at assizes of a charge of murdering a girl named Ashford; her brother brought an [...] "appeal," [...] and the judges upheld Thornton's claim, but the appellant then withdrew.
