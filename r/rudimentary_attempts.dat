So far, however, there have been only <b>rudimentary</b> <b>attempts</b> to make those data visible on the Semantic Web. This paper presents a sketch of what (national) libraries will need to supply in order to allow for broad use of their data on the Semantic Web. The main points are persistent URIs for all entities, a set of welldefined vocabularies to describe the data, and the provision of query interfaces suitable for the Semantic Web. In the final section three current projects from the German National Library are presented, in which the semantics of bibliographic data is presented using Semantic Web techniques...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review is to discuss the roles of cascade {{impactor}} (CI) data in inhaler assessment and {{to examine the relationship}} between aerodynamic particle size distribution (APSD) and the clinical response to inhaled drugs. A systematic literature search of studies linking APSD to clinical response was undertaken. Two distinct roles for CI-generated data were identified: (1) the control of inhaler/drug product quality; and (2) the provision of data that may be predictive of particle deposition in the respiratory tract. Method robustness is required for the former application, combined with simplicity in operation, resulting in <b>rudimentary</b> <b>attempts</b> to mimic the anatomy of the respiratory tract. The latter necessitates making the apparatus and its operation more closely resemble patient use of the inhaler. A CI cannot perfectly simulate the respiratory tract, since it operates at constant flow rate, while the respiratory cycle has a varying flow-time profile. On the basis of a review of studies linking APSD to clinical response of inhaled drugs, it is concluded that attempts to use CI-generated data from quality control testing to compare products for bioequivalence are likely to have only limited success, as links between laboratory-measured APSD, particle deposition in the respiratory tract, and clinical response are not straightforward...|$|E
40|$|For {{over forty}} years, we have assumed {{hierarchical}} file system namespaces. These namespaces were a <b>rudimentary</b> <b>attempt</b> at simple organization. As users {{have begun to}} interact with increasing amounts of data and are increasingly demanding search capability, such a simple hierarchical model has outlasted its usefulness. For this reason, we should design file systems whose organizations map to the ways we access and manipulate data now. We present a new file system architecture in which we replace the hierarchical namespace with a tagged, search-based one. ...|$|R

500|$|Most {{criticism}} of the show revolves around the accuracy and presentation of its factual content. The TV series, like the books, {{has been used by}} educators as a classroom aid and was endorsed by UK Education Secretary Michael Gove as useful for spotlighting [...] "neglected periods of history." [...] However, writing after the final episode, Simon Hoggart in The Spectator noted that [...] "There has been some whipped-up controversy about Horrible Histories", adding that [...] "where the books make a <b>rudimentary</b> <b>attempt</b> to teach history as a series of interconnected events, the television show is basically gags, chiefly about defecation, gluttony, murder and torture. It's quite amusing, though whether it will pique an interest in the subject, or—as some say—merely encourage children to learn more about defecation, gluttony, murder and torture, we cannot know." ...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{several decades}} of {{theoretical}} support and empirical validation concerning Multicultural Counseling Competence (MCC), {{the mental health}} field {{has been criticized for}} a lack of measurable constructs that embody multicultural counseling skills (Sanchez-Hucles & Jones, 2005; Weinrach & Thomas, 1998). In an effort to contribute to the knowledge and understanding of observable multicultural counseling interventions, web-based survey research was used {{to examine the relationship between}} the counselor’s broaching behavior and multicultural counseling competence in a sample of middle school counselors. Broaching has been conceptualized as a measurable multicultural counseling skill and refers to a counselor’s effort to initiate and process discussions of race, ethnicity, and culture in the counseling relationship (Day-Vines, et al., 2007). Results revealed a statistically significant relationship between broaching and multicultural counseling competence. Most notably, advanced attitudes toward broaching as conceptualized in the broaching construct are predictive of multicultural counseling competence. Additionally, the relationship between broaching skills and MCC seems to indicate that even <b>rudimentary</b> <b>attempt...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{thesis is}} at once a somewhat <b>rudimentary</b> <b>attempt</b> to relate {{the history of the}} classroom while describing the potential impact on the space of learning by the introduction of a new type of computer program into a school setting. It asks the question: how is the space of learning affected by the use of this specific type of computer program as an educational tool? In order to begin to formulate an answer to this question I have drawn upon the theorizing of Foucault and Deleuze in particular. Establishing the modern classroom as a relative of sorts to the disciplinary spaces of the past, I conclude that the means and practices by which pupils are being controlled within the space of learning have shifted from discipline being extorted exclusively by the teacher – who in turn is aided by the physical and temporal constraints of the classroom – to control being applied by each individual pupil through technologies of the self. This, in turn, led me to the conclusion that although there are certainly quite tangible effects on the space of learning itself, the actual mode of learning may ver...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{losses from}} natural catastrophes are substantial; e. g., US 130 billion in 2010. ‘Catastrophe models’ are {{stochastic}} event-set based models that simulate these risks and underpin their assessment {{in the insurance}} industry. Most catastrophe models are proprietary ’black boxes’, which limit the level of user interaction, but new regulations (Solvency II) require firms to understand better the assumptions upon which the calculations ultimately rest. Part of this greater transparency requires constraining where uncertainty originates, perhaps by interchanging components provided by rival model vendors in ’plug and play’ catastrophe models. The objective {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate a practical, accessible way in which this may be made possible. Specifically to do this the first, illustrative ‘plug and play’ model was created efficiently and effectively using OpenMI, a free ‘open-source’ model linking standard. In about 100 man-hours climate, groundwater flow, vulnerability, exposure and loss components were linked to output financial losses, i. e. occurrence exceedance probability (OEP) curves. Groundwater flooding near Marlborough (UK) is used for this proof of concept. Losses from this example dataset are small, about £. 8 million for a 33 yr OEP, but groundwater is an important compounding factor in UK flooding and this is the first, albeit <b>rudimentary,</b> <b>attempt</b> to probabilistically model loss for this hazard. Selected components are swopped, and losses calculated to show how insights into the origin of uncertainty can be gained. Crucially, OpenMI has the future potential to operate online and shield valuable data within components whilst allowing them to be swopped. So, it has the potential to underpin a secure, open-source, practical framework of use to the insurance industry...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{examined the}} process of the longitudinal rolling of tubes through a set of three driven grooved rolls. Tubes were rolled with or without internal support i. e. under mandrel rolling or sinking conditions. Knowledge was required {{of the way in which}} the roll separating force and rolling torque vary for different conditions of rolling. The objective of this work being to obtain a better understanding and optimization of the mechanics of the process. The design and instrumentation of a complete experimental three-roll mill for the rolling of lead tube as an analogue material for hot steel, with the measurement of the individual roll force and torque is described. A novel type of roll load cell was incorporated and its design and testing discussed. Employing three roll sizes of 170 mm, 255 mm and 340 mm shroud diameter, precise tube specimens of various tube diameter to thickness ratios were rolled under sinking and mandrel rolling conditions. To obtain an indication of the tube-roll contact areas some of the specimens were partially rolled. For comparative purposes the remaining tubes were completely rolled as a single pass. The roll forces, torques and tube parameters e. g. reduction of area, D/t ratio, were collated and compared for each of the three roll diameters considered. The influence of friction, particularly in the mandrel rolling process, was commented upon. Theoretical studies utilising the equilibrium and energy methods were applied to both the sinking and mandrel rolling processes. In general, the energy approach gave better comparison with experiment, especially for mandrel rolling. The influence of the tube deformation zones on the two processes was observed and on the subsequent modification of the tube-roll arc contact length. A <b>rudimentary</b> <b>attempt</b> was made in the theoretical sinking analysis to allow for the deformation zone prior to roll contact; some success was noted. A general survey of the available tube rolling literature, for both the sinking and mandrel processes has been carried out...|$|R

40|$|Introduction MEG and EEG {{have the}} time {{resolution}} necessary {{to look at the}} visual system's real-time response to alternating visual stimuli. Currently, investigators in the field of EEG have carried out the most complete study of the human brain's response to alternating visual stimuli. Some of the early work using steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) stressed the importance of controlling all physical properties of the stimulus. van der Tweel et al. [1] used a sinusoidally modulated white light source at many different modulation frequencies. They found that the sinewave shape was reproduced very well in the EEG at 9 - 15 Hz for diffuse large field illumination. Regardless of the purely sinusoidal input, 2 nd harmonics were found in response to diffuse illumination between 5 - 9 Hz.

In section A, chapter one, I discuss the philosophical background to the contemporary discussion of minds and mental states.

"This {{suggested}} work {{seems to}} have been done, as in the following year we read: 'The ceiling has been raised eighteen inches; the windows have been enlarged; and the old uncomfortable desks and tables have been replaced by some which were formerly used in the schools in the Town Hall.' I think the school, as I remember it, was about as these changes left it. We entered through a short, narrow hallway {{at the back of the}} school. This hall had hooks for clothes on one side and a shelf on the other, on one end of which was kept a large bucket of fresh water for drinking purposes. This was brought over from the high service pumping station next door each morning, Mr. Webber, engineer there, being the janitor for the little school. He was in league with Miss Hyde, I am sure, to make our days in that school some of the happiest and most worthwhile of any of our school days. <b>Rudimentary</b> sanitation was <b>attempted.</b> Each pupil was required to have an individual drinking cup. Wood for the huge stove was kept outside in a sort of closet in the hall, west of the entrance. If the day's supply which was left in the morning beside the stove gave out, the older boys could renew it. Then, still further along at the end of the hall, was our one out-of-door facility. Another was added during the years I was there." ...|$|R
25|$|When {{the ball}} was bowled along the ground, the batsman used his curved bat to attack {{it and try to}} hit it away, usually with the {{intention}} of lofting it over the fielders. There was, as such, no defensive technique other than the most <b>rudimentary</b> and instinctive <b>attempt</b> to stop a ball that had deceived him. The pitched delivery made the curved bat obsolete and the straight bat lent itself to the deployment of a defensive stroke. As the aim of the batsman with a curved bat was to hit the ball over the fielders, low scores were normal. If he did not time his shot correctly, the chances were high that he would miss the ball and be bowled or stumped; or else if he hit it poorly, he would not clear the fielder and be caught out. In addition, the pitches of the time were little more than rough tracks which were to the bowler's advantage. One of the greatest players of the pioneering period was Richard Newland of Slindon and Sussex. In July 1745, he scored 88 for All-England against Kent at the Artillery Ground. It is not absolutely certain that he did this in one innings as it may have been his match total (there is a parallel here with Small in a 1768 match). If it was one innings, it is the highest individual score recorded during the pioneering period and, for its time, was a very high score which could equate in real terms to a modern triple-century.|$|R
40|$|Drawing policy {{conclusions}} from uncontrolled studies Studying {{a population of}} adults seenin clinic for biliary colic, Boris Sobolev and associates 1 documented an association between longer waiting times and admissions for emergency cholecystectomy. However, because the patients were not randomly assigned to the waiting list, readers should entertain the possi-bility that the findings were driven by an association with a so-called “third variable. ” For example, the patients who {{ended up on the}} waiting list might have been sicker. If so, the observed as-sociation between waiting times and emergency admissions was actually dri-ven by an unobserved association be-tween health status and emergency ad-missions. Sobolev and associates 1 acknowledge the possibility of con-founding by patient morbidity, and they do <b>attempt</b> <b>rudimentary</b> adjust-ment for other potential confounding variables. However, even if they had had access to better data on patients’ health status, the criticism of potential confounding would remain. Prior studies, none of which were cited by Sobolev and associates, 1 have addressed this problem by means of econometric methodology. 2 – 4 Hamilton and colleagues 2 used an estimation strategy that accounted for unmeasured health differences and found no effect of waiting times on death rates for pa-tients waiting for hip fracture surgery. Subsequent comparisons of patients with hip fracture in the United States and Canada 3, 4 arrived at a similar con-clusion. Policy-makers seeking to draw con-clusions from the findings of Sobolev and associates 1 would be well advised to consider these more sophisticated econometric analyses in their delibera-tions...|$|R

40|$|Book chapter from: The Oxford Classical Dictionary, digital edition. 2016. Available at: [URL] all {{inhabitants}} {{of the ancient world}} were dependent to varying degrees on retailers to supply them with at least some food items, raw materials, or manufactured goods, and this was particularly true of urban inhabitants. While the amount of built commercial space increased in the Hellenistic period, and was a particular feature of Roman urban centres, we cannot trace a simple linear development from periodic markets through to permanent shops. Instead the retail trade remained varied throughout antiquity, consisting of periodic and permanent markets, shops and workshops, and street stalls and ambulant hawkers, all of which performed complementary roles within an integrated network of distribution. The size of the local market, however, inevitably {{had an impact on the}} organisation of the retail trade, with increased specialisation and clustering of trades possible in larger urban centres, where a wider range of products was typically available to the consumer and capital investment in dedicated commercial space was encouraged by the level of demand for goods. Ancient shopping was an immersive and interactive experience. Prices fluctuated in response to market pressures and were very often arrived at through a process of haggling and bargaining. Markets, shops, and streets were as much places of social interaction as they were shopping, and men and women mixed freely as both buyers and sellers. Advertising and marketing may have been <b>rudimentary,</b> but the <b>attempts</b> by retailers to maximise sales contributed to the colourful and vibrant nature of the ancient commercial environment; the open doorways of shops and workshops facilitated interaction between those inside and outside, and goods, sellers, and customers very often spilled out onto the street, while painted notices and signs displayed goods for sale, and the distinctive shouts of sellers competed loudly for the attention of potential customers...|$|R

In section A, chapter one, I discuss the philosophical background to the contemporary discussion of minds and mental states. I defend the controversial claim that only living things can be said to have minds or mental states, and I argue that there are no convincing grounds for rejecting the common view that mental states are real phenomena. This in no way implies the more controversial view that all mental phenomena share some distinguishing feature that characterises them as mental. If, however, there is some distinguishing property which is common to all mental states, and only those states, then the two most promising philosophical candidates for this property would surely be consciousness and intentionality. I argue that the different varieties of consciousness distinguished by philosophers fail to "carve nature at the joints". I then analyse {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} three common definitions of intentionality. Lastly, I examine Dennett's intentional stance and argue that the two ways in which it can be formulated are in fact quite distinct. I propose that one of these formulations, which I refer to as the agent-centred intentional stance, can be used to help us identify creatures with minimal minds. In section B (chapters two to eight), I attempt to identify the necessary conditions for intentional agency in creatures, by examining several broad categories of behavioural and biological properties that have been proposed in the philosophical and scientific literature as relevant to having a mind, and sifting through them, all the while attempting to put together a constructive definition of a "minimal mind". In particular, I discuss sensory capacities (including discriminatory ability and perception); memory; flexible behaviour patterns; the ability to learn; self-directed movement and control; the ability to correct one's mistakes; and the ability to form concepts. Within each category of "mind-relevant" properties, I examine the different ways in which these properties are realised by different kinds of organisms, at various levels of complexity. The biological case studies that 1 discuss range from the relatively simple (viruses) to the most complex (vertebrates, especially birds and mammals). In section C, I list about a dozen detailed conditions that an animal has to meet before it can be said to possess this kind of "minimal mind", which, 1 argue, is the most basic kind of mind anything can have. Perhaps the most crucial condition is that the animal possess an internal "minimal map" by which it represents the means it has to adopt to achieve its ends, enabling it to steer itself around its environment. 1 argue that animals whose maps are of the right sort can be said to have beliefs, desires and intentions. Finally, 1 claim that these "minimal minds" come in no less than four different varieties. Operant agency, navigation using visual landmarks, tool use and the social practice of following a guide are all behaviours that manifest mental states. Although these states are not phenomenally conscious states, 1 argue that the intentionality they possess is fundamentally the same as that found in conscious mental states. In the end, I conclude that many insects and spiders, as well as octopuses and squid, and of course fish, qualify as having minimal minds.
