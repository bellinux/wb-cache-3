40|$|According to the World Economic Forum, the {{transport}} infrastructure {{is one of}} the twelve pillars of every economy’s competitiveness. Well-developed transport infrastructure affects a business location, integrates the national market and reduces the effect of distance between regions. Furthermore, the quality and extensiveness of infrastructure (both road and rail), determine the economic growth of the country and its particular regions. The aim of the article is to present the state of development of <b>railway</b> <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in Eastern Poland (including five provinces located close to the eastern border of the country), as well as the analysis of basic indicators characterizing this aspect of the regional development of the analysed area in comparison to other Polish regions. The main directions of development of the <b>railway</b> <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in Eastern Poland, which are described in both the national and EU strategic documents, will also be analysed. The research method that will be used to achieve the purpose of the article is the analysis of secondary data, including statistical data obtained from the Central Statistical Office in Poland as well as analysis of strategic documents, where the crucial directions of development of Eastern Poland are described. We also put forth our own concept of ranking voivodships based on available statistical data whose aim was to show the level, to which the various regions of Poland differ from each other {{when it comes to the}} development of rail infrastructure. The results of the analyses will have managerial implications. They will provide the source of considerable information for regional authorities of the eastern region of Poland in terms of differences in the level of development of the railway infrastructure of Eastern Poland and other regions of Poland.

40|$|In recent decades, <b>railway</b> <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructures</b> {{have been}} regaining their {{importance}} {{due to their}} efficiency and environmentally friendly technologies. This has led to increasing train speeds, higher axle loads and more frequent train usage. These improved service provisions have however brought new challenges to traditional railway track engineering, especially to track geotechnical dynamics. These challenges demanded for {{a better understanding of}} the track dynamics. Due to the large cost and available load conditions limitation, experimental investigation is not always the best choice for the dynamic effect study of railway track structure. Comparatively speaking, an accurate mathematical modeling and numerical solution of the dynamic interaction of the track structural components reveals distinct advantage for understanding the response behavior of the track structure. The purpose of this thesis is to study the influence of design parameters on dynamic response of the railway track structure by implementing Finite Element Method (FEM). According to the complexity, different railway track systems have been simulated, including: Beam on discrete support model, Discretely support track including ballast mass model and Rail on sleeper on continuum model. The rail and sleeper have been modeled by Euler-Bernoulli beam element. Spring and dashpot has been used for the simulation of railpads and the connection between the sleeper and ballast ground. Track components have been studied separately and comparisons have been made between different models. The finite element analysis is divided into three categories: eigenvalue analysis, dynamic analysis and general static analysis. The eigenfrequencies and corresponding vibration modes were extracted from all the models. The main part of the finite element modeling involves the steady-state dynamic analysis, in which receptance functions were obtained and used as the criterion for evaluating the dynamic properties of track components. Dynamic explicit analysis has been used for the simulation of a moving load, and the train speed effect has been studied. The displacement of the trackbed has been evaluated and compared to the measurement taken in Sweden in the static analysis. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. In Ukraine, {{as in many}} {{countries}} of the world, transport {{is one of the}} most fundamental sectors of the national economy, important part of the industrial and social spheres. But in the conditions of industry reforming there are problems of investing in development of rail transport. So the work is devoted to the grounds of potentially available sources of investment in <b>infrastructure</b> of <b>railway</b> <b>transport</b> of Ukraine. The work stresses the importance of the problem of attracting foreign investment in the economy, highlights the proposals to solve this problem. Methodology. To solve the problems of this class the work presents the proposed methods of analysis, synthesis and comparison, deduction, induction, logic and abstraction. It becomes necessary to search for and study of new conceptual approaches to organization of investment processes at <b>railway</b> <b>transport</b> enterprises, appropriate management and financial decisions and schemes of railway infrastructure development. Findings. The paper shows ways to optimize investment for modernization and technical re-equipment of the transport complex of Ukraine. It proposes the ways of attracting capital of investors for development of transport infrastructure: compliance with European laws and regulations; reforming of the tax system of Ukraine; combating corruption in the country; implementation of public-private partnership tools into the mechanism of state regulation of investment processes; creating a favourable investment climate for implementation of rail <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> projects; creating a system of compensation to investors; guarantees of <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> investment protection. Originality. The work offers the sources of investment for development of railway infrastructure in Ukraine, which should include: state budget funds, use of targeted loans and leasing. The main direction of the state policy concerning infrastructure should be a gradual transition of activity in creation and operation of infrastructure facilities from a spending unit that is a burden for the state to efficient business through public-private partnerships.

40|$|Life-cycle cost (LCC) {{analysis}} {{is an economic}} technique {{used to assess the}} totalcosts associated with the lifetime of a system in order to support decision making in long termstrategic planning. For complex systems, such as railway and road infrastructures, the cost ofmaintenance {{plays an important role in}} the LCC analysis. Costs associated with maintenanceinterventions can be more reliably estimated by integrating the probabilistic nature of thefailures associated to these interventions in the LCC models. Reliability, Maintainability,Availability and Safety (RAMS) parameters describe the maintenance needs of an asset in aquantitative way by using probabilistic information extracted from registered maintenanceactivities. Therefore, the integration of RAMS in the LCC analysis allows obtaining reliablepredictions of system maintenance costs and the dependencies of these costs with specific costdrivers through sensitivity analyses. This paper presents an innovative approach for acombined RAMS & LCC methodology for <b>railway</b> and road <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructures</b> beingdeveloped under the on-going H 2020 project INFRALERT.

40|$|This paper aims to use spatial {{statistical}} {{tools to}} explore the reciprocal spatial–temporal effects of <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and urban growth of Jeddah city, a fast developing polycentric city in Saudi Arabia. Global spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I) and local indicators of spatial association (LISA) are first {{used to analyze the}} spatial–temporal clustering of urban growth and <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> from 1980 to 2007. Then, spatial regression analysis is conducted to investigate the mutual spatial–temporal effects of urban growth and <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> Results indicate a significant positive global spatial autocorrelation of all defined variables between 1980 and 2007. LISA results also reveal a constant significant spatial association of <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> expansion and urban growth variables from 1980 to 2007.
