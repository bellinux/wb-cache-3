40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess glucose {{homeostasis}} {{and weight loss}} in morbidly obese patients undergoing Silastic® <b>ring</b> <b>sleeve</b> gastrectomy. METHODS: This was a prospective clinical study. Thirty-three female patients with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 42. 33 ± 1. 50 kg/m² (range: 40 - 45 kg/m²), {{a mean age of}} 36. 7 ± 9. 4 years and a mean waist circumference of 118. 7 ± 5. 98 cm were included in this study. Type 2 diabetes mellitus was observed in 11 patients (33. 3 %), and glucose intolerance was observed in 4 patients (12. 1 %). Mean plasma fasting glucose levels were 109. 77 ± 44. 19 mg/dl (75 - 320) in the preoperative period. All Silastic® <b>ring</b> <b>sleeve</b> gastrectomy procedures were performed by the same surgical team using the same anesthetic technique. The patients were monitored for at least 12 months after surgery. RESULTS: The mean weight of the patients decreased from 107. 69 ± 6. 57 kg to 70. 52 ± 9. 36 kg (p < 0. 001), the mean BMI decreased to 27. 4 ± 2. 42 kg/m² (p < 0. 001), and the mean waist circumference decreased to 89. 87 cm ± 6. 66 (p < 0. 001) in the postoperative period. Excess BMI loss was 86. 5 ± 14. 2 %. Fasting glucose levels were reduced to 80. 94 ± 6. 3 mg/dl (p < 0. 001). Remission of diabetes and glucose intolerance was observed in all patients. CONCLUSION: Silastic® <b>ring</b> <b>sleeve</b> gastrectomy was effective in promoting weight loss, waist circumference reduction and control of {{glucose homeostasis}} in morbidly obese patients.

40|$|Obesity is {{associated}} with gastroesophageal reflux disease. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is the most performed bariatric procedure in the world, whereas sleeve gastrectomy is an emerging procedure. Both can be combined {{with the use of}} a SilasticA (R) ring. the aim of this study was to compare the evolution of erosive esophagitis (EE) in patients who underwent SilasticA (R) ring gastric bypass (SRGB) and SilasticA (R) <b>ring</b> <b>sleeve</b> gastrectomy (SRSG) after a 1 -year postoperative period. We carried out a non-randomized, prospective, controlled clinical study. Sixty-five patients were enrolled based on the following inclusion criteria: female gender, age 20 - 60 years old, BMI 40 - 45 and written informed consent. the exclusion criteria were secondary obesity, alcohol or drug use, severe psychiatric disorder, binge-eating of sweets, and previous stomach or bowel surgery. the patients were divided into two groups- 33 (51 %) underwent SRSG and 32 (49 %) patients underwent SRGB. All patients underwent an esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy during the preoperative period and at 12 - 14 months after the surgery. Preoperatively, 15 patients (23. 8 %) were found to have EE, six (19. 4 %) in the SRSG group and nine patients (28. 1 %) in the SRGB group (p = 0. 7795). Postoperatively, there was an increase in the number of patients with EE in the SRSG group to 14 (45. 2 %) and a decrease in the SRGB group to two (6. 3 %), giving a total of 16 patients with EE (25. 4 %; p = 0. 0007). After 1 year of follow-up, we observed a worsening evolution of EE in the SRSG group, but improvement in the SRGB group.

5000|$|A few guitars feature stereo output, such as Rickenbacker guitars {{equipped}} with Rick-O-Sound. There {{are a variety}} of ways the [...] "stereo" [...] effect may be implemented. Commonly, but not exclusively, stereo guitars route the neck and bridge pickups to separate output buses on the guitar. A stereo cable then routes each pickup to its own signal chain or amplifier. For these applications, the most popular connector is a high-impedance 1/4-inch plug with a tip, <b>ring</b> and <b>sleeve</b> configuration, also known as a TRS phone connector. Some studio instruments, notably certain Gibson Les Paul models, incorporate a low-impedance three-pin XLR connector for balanced audio.

This can result in a contact in the socket bridging (shorting) the <b>ring</b> and <b>sleeve</b> contacts on a phone connector, or where a phone plug is inserted into a two-conductor TS socket in some cases the intended 'sleeve' contact in the socket making contact with only the 'ring' portion of the plug.|$|R

All the skulls of those in the boat were found in a pyramidal formation. The sunken wreck lay at a downward angle, causing the heads to become detached from the bodies and to roll down the slope into that position. Three bodies were found lying under the battery boards directly on top of the batteries, with arms folded. They may have died of the effects of chlorine gas before the rest of the crew.

5000|$|The {{synchronizer}} has {{to overcome}} {{the momentum of the}} entire input shaft and clutch disk when it is changing shaft rpm to match the new gear ratio. It can be abused by exposure to the momentum and power of the engine, which is what happens when attempts are made to select a gear without fully disengaging the clutch. This causes extra wear on the <b>rings</b> and <b>sleeves,</b> reducing their service life. When an experimenting driver tries to [...] "match the revs" [...] on a synchronized transmission and force it into gear without using the clutch, the synchronizer will make up for any discrepancy in RPM. The success in engaging the gear without clutching can deceive the driver into thinking that the RPM of the layshaft and transmission were actually exactly matched. Nevertheless, approximate rev. matching with clutching can decrease the difference in rotational speed between the layshaft and transmission gear shaft, therefore decreasing synchro wear.|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundHand hygiene of {{healthcare}} personnel {{is one of}} the most important interventions for reducing transmission of nosocomial pathogens. Previous studies have demonstrated that the use of alcohol-based hand gel increases hand hygiene compliance, but that effective use of this product cannot be taken for granted. ObjectiveEvaluate factors associated with poor hand hygiene effectiveness of hospital workers using an alcohol-based hand gel and the effect of an education program. DesignA direct observational prospective study of hand hygiene effectiveness prior to training and immediately after training. Setting and subjects 3067 hospital workers of different professional categories in several hospital units in the University Hospital of Nancy (France). ResultsTime after program start (OR 0. 97, 95 %CI 0. 96 – 0. 97) and being female (OR 0. 37, 0. 24 – 0. 58) were highly associated with increased effectiveness of hand hygiene prior to training. Wearing rings other than a wedding ring (OR 1. 8, 1. 2 – 2. 7), a bracelet (OR 2. 0, 1. 1 – 3. 6), a watch (OR 1. 9, 1. 3 – 2. 9) and having long nails were associated with ineffective hand rub use. Professional background was also a strong predictor with nurses and especially senior nurses demonstrating much better effectiveness than all other professional groups. Wearing wedding <b>rings</b> or long <b>sleeves,</b> and having varnished nails, visibly dirty hands prior to washing and cutaneous lesions were not associated with effective gel use. ConclusionThese results demonstrate that an educational program can significantly improve the proper practices for using hand rub and hand washing compliance. This study has also demonstrated that wearing rings, bracelets, watches and long nails impair hand gel application but that wedding <b>rings,</b> long <b>sleeves</b> and varnished nails do not. The finding of that hand hygiene effectiveness increased with time even prior to training indicates that knowledge gained by staff trained early diffused into those who had not yet been trained...|$|R
