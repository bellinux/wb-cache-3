40|$|This paper adapts the {{entrepreneurial}} theory developed by Richard Cantillon, Frank Knight, and Ludwig von Mises {{to the theory}} of “political entrepreneurship. ” Political entrepreneurship is an outgrowth of the theory of the market entrepreneur, and derives from extending entrepreneurial theory from the market into the political sphere of action. By applying the theory of the entrepreneur to political behavior, we provide a basis for identifying political entrepreneurs, and for separating them analytically from other government agents. The essence of political entrepreneurship is the <b>redirection</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> from the path it would have taken in an unregulated market. Nevertheless, this production does produce an income stream to political entrepreneurs which closely resembles the profit of market entrepreneurs...|$|E
40|$|Anthropogenic {{activities}} can induce major trophic shifts in aquatic systems, {{yet we have}} an incomplete understanding of the implication of such shifts on ecosystem function and on primary production (PP) in particular. In recent decades, phytoplankton biomass and production in the Laurentian Great Lakes have declined in response to reduced nutrient concentrations and invasive mussels. However, the increases in water clarity associated with declines in phytoplankton may have positive effects on benthic PP at the ecosystem scale. Have these lakes experienced oligotrophication (a reduction of algal production), or simply a shift in autotrophic structure with no net decline in PP? Benthic contributions to ecosystem PP are rarely measured in large aquatic systems, but our calculations based on productivity rates from the Great Lakes indicate that a significant proportion (up to one half, in Lake Huron) of their whole-lake production may be benthic. The large declines (5 – 45 %) in phytoplankton production in the Great Lakes from the 1970 s to 2000 s may be substantially compensated by benthic PP, which increased by up to 190 %. Thus, the autotrophic productive capacity of large aquatic ecosystems may be relatively resilient to shifts in trophic status, due to a <b>redirection</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> to the near-shore benthic zone, and large lakes may exhibit shifts in autotrophic structure analogous to the regime shifts seen in shallow lakes...|$|E
500|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War I in July 1914 drastically altered the situation; the British Government declared a naval blockade of Germany in August after it entered the war. The blockade {{meant that the}} guns could not be delivered, but the ship was nevertheless launched on 11 November 1914. With no possibility of arming the ship, work was halted on 31 December 1914. In addition, manpower shortages created by the war, along with the <b>redirection</b> <b>of</b> steel <b>production</b> {{to the needs of}} the Army meant that less critical projects could not be completed, especially since other warships were nearing completion and could be finished much more quickly. By this time Greece had only paid AG Vulcan £450,000. Bethlehem refused to send the main battery guns to Greece. The 14-inch guns were instead sold to the British, who used them to arm the four s.|$|R

In this paper, we propose the use of Service Path (SPath) to store and communicate the redirection information and knowledge for better performance.

40|$|Background and Purpose—Prehospital <b>redirection</b> <b>of</b> stroke {{patients}} to a regional center {{is used as}} a strategy to maximize the provision of intravenous thrombolysis. We developed a model to quantify the benefit <b>of</b> <b>redirection</b> away from local services that were already providing thrombolysis. Methods—A microsimulation using hospital and ambulance data from consecutive emergency admissions to 10 local acute stroke units estimated the effect <b>of</b> <b>redirection</b> to 2 regional neuroscience centers. Modeled outcomes reflected additional journey time and accuracy of stroke identification in the prehospital phase, and the relative efficiency of patient selection and door-needle time for each local site compared with the nearest regional neuroscience center. Results—Thrombolysis was received by 223 / 1884 emergency admissions. Based on observed site performance, 68 additional patients would have been treated after theoretical <b>redirection</b> <b>of</b> 1269 true positive cases and 363 stroke mimics to the neuroscience center. Over 5 years <b>redirection</b> <b>of</b> this cohort generated 12. 6 quality-adjusted life years at a marginal cost of £ 6730 (10 320, € 8347). The average additional cost of a quality-adjusted life year gain was £ 534 (819, € 673). Conclusions—Under these specific circumstances, redirection would have improved outcomes from thrombolysis at little additional cost...|$|R
