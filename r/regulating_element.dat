Here, the load current IR2 is supplied by the transistor whose base is now connected to the Zener diode. Thus the transistor's base current (IB) forms the load current for the Zener diode and is {{much smaller than the}} current through R2. This regulator is classified as [...] "series" [...] because the <b>regulating</b> <b>element,</b> viz., the transistor, appears in series with the load.R1 sets the Zener current (IZ) and is determined as [...] where, VZ is the Zener voltage, IB is the transistor's base current, K = 1.2 to 2 (to ensure that R1 is low enough for adequate IB) and [...] where, IR2 is the required load current and is also the transistor's emitter current (assumed to be equal to the collector current) and hFE(min) is the minimum acceptable DC current gain for the transistor.|$|E
5000|$|As the {{pneumatic}} operation of valves, compared to motorised operation, has cost and reliability advantages, pneumatic actuation {{is still an}} industry standard. To allow the construction of hybrid systems, where the 4-20 mA is generated by the controller, but {{enables the use of}} pneumatic valves, a range of current to pressure (I to P) converters are available from manufacturers. These are usually located locally to the control valve and convert 4-20 mA to 3-15 psi (or (0.2 - 1.0 bar).This signal is then fed to the valve actuator or more commonly, a pneumatic positioner. This is a dedicated controller with a pneumatic nozzle and flapper arrangement and a mechanical linkage to sense the valve actuator movement. This ensures that problems of friction are overcome and the valve control element moves to the desired position, by comparing the actual valve <b>regulating</b> <b>element</b> position against the desired value; hence the name [...] "positioner". As a mechanical linkage is used for this, the positioner has to be mounted on the valve body. A positioner also allows the use of higher air pressures for valve actuation, which is particularly useful with cylinder type valve actuators.|$|E

40|$|UV {{irradiation}} stimulates {{expression of}} the gene encoding the key enzyme chalcone synthase (CHS), {{which leads to the}} generation of protective flavonoids in parsley cell cultures. CHS transcripts increase after 3 to 4 hr, and early genes are involved in the signal transduction to the CHS promoter. By using the fluorescent differential display technique in a large-scale screening, several early UV light–induced genes were isolated. Of these, a novel glutathione S-transferase (PcGST 1) is induced within 2 hr and precedes CHS expression. Overexpression of PcGST 1 in transformed cell lines containing a CHS promoter/luciferase reporter (CHS-LUC) affected the onset of LUC transcription. Supplementing these cell lines with glutathione immediately stimulated CHS-LUC expression within 2 hr in dark-incubated cells and resulted in a biphasic induction profile in UV-irradiated cells. Our data indicate the involvement of glutathione and PcGST 1 in early events of a UV light–dependent signal transduction pathway to CHS.

40|$|There are an {{increasing}} number of genetic and neuropathological observations to suggest that cystatin C, an extracellular protein produced by all nucleated cells, might {{play a role in the}} pathophysiology of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent observations indicate that small and large soluble oligomers of the beta-amyloid protein (A beta) impair synaptic plasticity and induce neurotoxicity in AD. The objective of the present study was to investigate the influence of cystatin C on the production of such oligomers in vitro. Co-incubation of cystatin C with monomeric A beta 1 - 42 significantly attenuated the in vitro formation of A beta oligomers and protofibrils, as determined using electron microscopy (EM), dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), immunoblotting, thioflavin T (ThT) spectrofluorimetry and gel chromatography. However, cystatin C did not dissolve preformed A beta oligomers. Direct binding of cystatin C to A beta was demonstrated with the formation of an initial 1 : 1 molar high-affinity complex.

30|$|Water {{deficit is}} a key <b>regulating</b> <b>element</b> of plant growth and {{development}} under the panoply of environmental conditions around the world. Irrigation offers an important feature of agricultural (cropping design) scheduling in areas where rainfall is insufficient to meet crop water requirements. Nevertheless, under rainfed agriculture, {{it is crucial to}} determine the optimum time for sowing to benefit from the existing soil moisture and precipitation, while under irrigated agriculture, it is imperative to establish the required amount of water and time of application. Generally, the determination of irrigation water demand employs the procedures for estimating evapotranspiration (E), which (apart from precipitation) is {{an important component of the}} hydrological budget [2]. The latter reckoned that weather stations must be sited on standardized vegetation surfaces (grass or alfalfa) in order to calculate crop reference or potential evapotranspiration (ETo). The high installation and maintenance cost constraints limits many nations in Sub-Saharan Africa from having vegetation reference sites or installed ETo-networks. Consequently, the systematic usage of incongruous climatic data for calculating ETo from sites that do not tally with standardization definitely results to systematic aggregate errors in irrigation scheduling and confounding conclusions.|$|E

Auxin inhibition of BAC promoter expression is {{at least in part}} controlled by a negatively <b>regulated</b> <b>element</b> and ethylene induction by a positively <b>regulated</b> <b>element.</b> One of a series of 15 different 10 -bp mutations created in a 2. 9 -kb BAC promoter reduced reporter gene expression by 60 %. The native sequence for this 10 -bp mutation includes a TGA-type basic leucine zipper (bZIP) motif. Tandem ligation of three 18 -bp BAC elements (Z-BAC), which includes the bZIP motif to a minimal − 50 35 S cauliflower mosaic virus promoter, enhanced expression in abscission zones (AZs) 13 -fold over that of the minimal promoter alone. The native forward orientation of the Z-BAC elements was essential for high expression levels. Expression of the Z-BAC minimal construct was 3 -fold greater in AZ than stems when compared with the expression levels of an internal control with an enhanced 35 S cauliflower mosaic virus promoter. Polymerase chain reaction {{was used to}} identify three TGA-type bZIP transcription factors in an AZ cDNA library. One of these factors was of the class I type and two of the class II type. RNA-blot analysis was completed for these genes and electrophoretic mobility shift assays used to confirm their binding to the Z-BAC element. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay-binding affinity was greatest for the class I TGA-type bZIP factor.

However, when a 1 : 1 ratio of metal/dinucleating ligand was used as a control, the midpoint of the B- to Z-DNA transition was at the same nickel concentration as in case of the dinuclear complex. The novel mononuclear analogue, N-methyl-N,N-bis- 2 (3, 5 -dimethylpyrazol- 1 -yl) ethyl]amine- nickel (II) -dinitrate (3) was inducing the Z-DNA at a similar ratio versus nucleotides as free nickel(II) itself.

40|$|The {{retrotransposon}} Ty 4 {{is found}} in different yeast strains at only one to three copies per haploid genome. In the present study, we aimed at relating the apparent low transpositional activity of Ty 4 to transcriptional features of this element. RT-PCR revealed that Ty 4 is transcribed at a very low level, being comparable with that of GAL 4. Contrary to other Ty elements, the transcriptional rate of Ty 4 is not affected in a sin 4 background nor by treatment of cells with alpha factor. From experiments measuring the expression levels in 1 acZ fusion constructs, we conclude that Ty 4 transcription is repressed by a negative <b>regulating</b> <b>element</b> residing within the LTR, whereas positive cis-acting elements, like {{those that have been}} found to mediate expression of Ty 1 / 2 and Ty 3, are absent from Ty 4. Analysing Ty 4 transcript termini by the RACE-PCR method, we found several distinct transcriptional initiation sites. But surprisingly, the majority of the polyadenylated Ty 4 transcripts terminate shortly upstream from the 3 ' LTR boundary, so that these transcripts do not contain a U 3 -R sequence, which is normally required for obligate strand transfer during DNA synthesis. Thus, the extremely low transcription rate of Ty 4 and imperfect Ty 4 transcripts are the reason for the low transpositional activity of this element...|$|E

It appears that further progress {{in this research}} field is being slowed by (i) a limited integration between the geochemical and the biological aspects {{of the research on}} colloids and (ii) a persistent gap between wellcontrolled laboratory studies and real field situations. This paper presents a simultaneous evaluation of the role of colloids in controlling element environmental fate and bioavailability at the confluence between a major river and a polluted tributary. Fractionation of trace elements among suspended particulate matter, colloids, and true solution suggests that colloids {{may play a role in}} the removal of trace elements from the water column to bed sediments during the mixing of the two rivers. Toxicity testing of water samples indicates that, in this specific system, contaminants associated with colloids can contribute to water toxicity for the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus but not for the green alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. To the best of our knowledge, the results for B. calyciflorus are the first ones pointing to the possible contribution of colloid-bound contaminants to water toxicity in environmental samples. Despite the uncertainties associated with field variability, the results of chemical analysis and toxicity testing show several points of convergence.

40|$|Introduction. Raw and {{processed}} Notoginseng Radix Et Rhizome (NRR) {{have been widely}} used in treatment of metabolic syndromes and related disease, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This study was designed to investigate lipid regulation effects of raw {{and processed}} NRR in steatotic L 02 cell. Materials and Methods. Steatotic L 02 cells were obtained after being cultured with 5 % fat emulsion- 10 % FBS-RPMI 1640 medium for 48 [*]h. Contents of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), free fatty acid (FFA), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in steatotic L 02 cells were evaluated after treatment. Furthermore, the lipid metabolism regulation mechanism of Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) and its monomers were evaluated by detecting the expressions of hydroxymethyl glutaric acyl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoAR), sterol <b>regulating</b> <b>element</b> binding protein- 2 (SREBP- 2), and cholesterol 7 α-hydroxylase (CYP 7 α). Results. TG and TC contents were doubled in model group compared to those in normal L 02 cells group. Raw NRR and NRR heated with sand (NRR-B) showed much remarkable lipid-lowering effects in steatotic L 02 cells. PNS, notoginsenoside R 1, ginsenoside Rg 1, and ginsenoside Rb 1 displayed the best TG and TC regulation activity, which could significantly reduce contents of SREBP- 2 and HMG-CoAR and increase the content of CYP 7 α.

However, there is no evidence on the effect of Docosapentaenoic Acid (DPA) on SREBP- 1 c expression levels. DPA is a long chain n- 3 fatty acid present in our diet through fish, red meat and milk of ruminant animals. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the effect of DPA on liver fatty acid synthesis in an in vitro model using rat liver cells. Our results suggested that DPA incubation (50 mu M) for 48 h (like EPA and DHA) caused a significant decrease in the mRNA expression levels of SREBP- 1 c, 3 -Hydroxy- 3 -Methyl-Glutaryl-Coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), Acetyl Coenzyme A Carboxylase (ACC- 1) and Fatty Acid Synthase (FASn) compared with Oleic Acid (OA) and also a decrease in the protein levels of SREBP- 1 and ACC- 1. A time-course fatty acid analysis showed that DPA and EPA are interconvertable in the cells; however, after 8 h of incubation with DPA, the cell phospholipids contained mainly DPA. The gene expression profiling of the lipogenic genes repeated at 8 h confirmed that the inhibitory effect of DPA on mRNA expression levels of the lipogenic genes was most likely due to DPA itself and not due to its conversion into EPA...|$|E
