40|$|Algumas regiões citrícolas, especialmente no continente europeu, ainda não foram, ao que parece, atingidas pela moléstia {{tristeza}} dos citros. Os conhecimentos adquiridos durante as investigações feitas sôbre a moléstia permitem indicar como identificá-la e prevenir suas desastrosas conseqüências nos laranjais. Os sintomas gerais nas plantas afetadas são semelhantes aos causados pela podridão do pé (gomose), podendo-se distinguí-la da tristeza examinando as raízes. Há combinações cavalo-enxêrto tolerantes e não tolerantes ao vírus. É, porisso, muito importante o reconhecimento da espécie cavalo, o que se pode fazer no pomar examinando a sua brotação ou observando o grau de congenialidade entre cavalo e enxerto. O teste colorimétrico feito com a casca da raiz também auxilia o reconhecimento. Os sintomas chamados "pitting" das limas ácidas e pomelos, permitem identificação da tristeza no pomar. O teste de Schneider, Wallace & Dimitan combinado com observações de campo, pode substituir, nas regiões onde a moléstia já foi constatada, os testes de transmissibilidade, mais rigorosos porém demorados, feitos no viveiro ou em estufas. A transmissão por enxertia ou por insetos vetores é feita da planta suspeita para plantas sadias de combinações não tolerantes ao vírus (laranjeira doce sobre azeda) ou para pés francos do limoeiro galego. É de interesse conhecer qual a estirpe do vírus predominante na região, para orientação dos citricultores quanto aos métodos de contrôle da moléstia. A identificação da espécie de afídios predominante na região permite prever a velocidade da disseminação da tristeza, porquanto umas são vetores muito eficientes, outras pouco. O contrôle da tristeza é obtido por métodos indiretos. Nas novas plantações evitam-se as combinações não tolerantes, empregando-se como variedade-cavalo as laranjeiras doces, as tangerineiras, os limoeiros Cravo (Rangpur) e Rugoso. Ãs vezes é possível o emprego de pés francos provenientes dos embriões nucelares. Nas plantações já existentes pode-se fazer a substituição total ou parcelada (individual) das plantas, conforme se constate predominância de afídios muito ou pouco eficientes e de estirpes fortes ou fracas do vírus. A sub-enxertia ("inarching"), a sôbre-enxertia ("topworking") e o afrancamento do enxerto são outras tantas modalidades de controle da tristeza, as quais podem ser vantajosamente empregadas em determinadas condições. Medidas de quarentena podem retardar a invasão das zonas ainda livres da tristeza, -sendo de interesse o esclarecimento do público quanto ao perigo representado pela importação de plantas ou suas partes vivas, exceto as sementes. The tristeza {{disease of}} citrus {{has not yet}} been reported from European countries nor from various other citrus growing areas of the world. Investigations on the disease have been carried out in various countries, such as Argentina, Australia, Brazil, South Africa, and United States. Knowledge obtained from these investigations enables citrus experts from areas not invaded by tristeza to recognize its presence in the orchards and to prevent disastrous losses for the industry. General decline symptoms of tristeza resemble those caused by foot rot, but root examination permits the differentiation of the two diseases. Presence of pitting symptoms in trees of West Indian limes or of grapefruits permits easy diagnosis of tristeza in the orchards. Stock-scion combinations may be tolerant or intolerant to tristeza. Thus, it be comes important to determine the rootstock in case of plants showing decline symptoms. This fact can be established by direct examination of sprouts from the rootstock or by observing the degree of congeniality of rootstock and scion. The colorimetric tests made with bark of the rootstock may help to determine it. Field observation of symptoms complemented by Schneider's histological tests may replace the transmission tests for field surveys of the disease in areas where tristeza is already known to be present. Transmission tests are usually carried out by methods of tissue union or by means of the vectors. Young plants of non-tolerant combinations (such as sweet orange on sour orange rootstock) or seedlings of West Indian limes may be used as test plants in these tests. A knowledge of the predominance of the various strains of the tristeza virus complex in the invaded areas is very important in regard to the application of control measures. Also the determination of the aphid vector or vectors in the areas concerned will permit forecasting the rate of spread of tristeza because efficiency varies considerably according to the vector species. Control of tristeza in citrus orchards is obtained by indirect methods. In new plantings made in invaded areas, non-tolerant stock-scion combinations should be avoided. Only tolerant rootstocks such as sweet oranges, mandarins, rangpur lime, and <b>rough</b> <b>lemons</b> should be used for most commercial tops. In some instances {{it may be possible to}} use unbudded trees originated from nucellar embryos. In established orchards, where a non-tolerant rootstock was employed, individual affected trees may be replaced or the whole planting may be interplanted with trees of a tolerant stock-scion combination. The first method is used in areas where the disease is disseminated by a poor vector, whereas the second method is more advisable in areas where spread of the disease is very rapid. Inarching or rooting the scion (by mounding the soil around its base) are used to control tristeza under some conditions. Top working with lemon may also be used. Quarantine barriers may prevent the introduction of tristeza in uninvaded areas. It is highly desirable to inform travellers about the risk represented by the introduction of citrus budwood material or cuttings from areas where the disease is known to be present...|$|R

40|$|Specificity in the {{interaction}} between <b>rough</b> <b>lemon</b> (Citrus jambhiri Lush.) and the fungal pathogen Alternaria alternata <b>rough</b> <b>lemon</b> pathotype is determined by a host-selective toxin, ACR-toxin. Mitochondria from <b>rough</b> <b>lemon</b> are sensitive to ACR-toxin whereas mitochondria from resistant plants, including other citrus species, are resistant. We have identified a C. jambhiri mitochondrial DNA sequence, designated ACRS (ACR-toxin sensitivity gene), that confers toxin sensitivity to Escherichia coli. ACRS {{is located in the}} group II intron of the mitochondrial tRNA-Ala and is translated into a SDS-resistant oligomeric protein in C. jambhiri mitochondria but is not translated in the toxin-insensitive mitochondria.

Divalent cations reduced proton movement in a concentration-dependent manner (both species), whereas trivalent cations (<b>rough</b> <b>lemon</b> only) caused the effective permeability to decrease to near zero. Inhibition by 10 mM CaCl 2 was reversed with water. The effects of these cations on the permeability of cuticles to protons was used to elucidate mechanisms by which cations can protect leaves from acid precipitation in nature...|$|E
40|$|Juice {{quality of}} 'Valencia' sweet orange [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osb. ] trees on Carrizo citrange [C. sinensis x Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf. ] or <b>rough</b> <b>lemon</b> (C. jambhiri Lush.) {{rootstocks}} was determined for fruit harvested by canopy quadrant and separated into size categories {{to ascertain the}} direct role of rootstock selection on juice soluble solids concentration (SSC) and soluble solids (SS) production per tree of citrus fruit. SS production per fruit and per tree for each size category was calculated. Juice quality was dependent on rootstock selection and fruit size, but independent of canopy quadrant. Fruit from trees on Carrizo citrange had > 20 % higher SSCs than fruit from trees on <b>rough</b> <b>lemon,</b> even for fruit of the same size. Large fruit accumulated more SS per fruit than smaller fruit, despite lower juice content and SSC. Within rootstocks, SS content per fruit decreased with decreasing fruit size, even though SSC increased. Rootstock effect on juice quality was a direct rather than an indirect one mediated through differences in fruit size. The conventional interpretation of juice quality data that differences in SSC among treatments, e. g., rootstocks or irrigation levels, or fruit size, are due to "dilution" of SS {{as a result of}} differences in fruit size and, hence, juice volume, is only partly supported by these data. Rather, accumulation of SS was greater for fruit from trees on Carrizo citrange than <b>rough</b> <b>lemon</b> by 25 % to 30 %. Articl...|$|E
40|$|The {{tolerance}} {{levels of}} citrus trees to {{different degrees of}} drought and flooding was studied by using twenty-three species and varieties. <b>Rough</b> <b>lemon,</b> trifoliate orange, lemon and Cleopatra mandarin were evaluated as the most flooding tolerant; Yuzu, `Kawano` natsudaidai,Kinukawa-mikan,`Tanaka` navel orange and Ponkan as medium; and Hana-daidai, Kosuito, Naruto-mikan and Natsudaidai as least tolerant. Trifoliate orange, Yuzu, Shiikuwasha, Hana-daidai,`Tanaka` navel orange, Natsudaidai, Shuto, Yamabuki, Ponkan and `Shiranui` were evaluated as the most drought tolerant; Cleopatra mandarin, Naruto-mikan and Murcot as medium and <b>Rough</b> <b>lemon,</b> lemon, Ban-okan and Kawano natsudaidai as drought intolerant. The effect of flooding and drought on 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC) content and ethylene production in the roots of these several species and varieties was determined. The ACC content and ethylene production in the roots increased more rapidly in sensitive species in response to water stress. Under flooding conditions, roots maintained higher ethylene production levels than control roots. Sensitive species showed a little greater levels in ethylene production than the tolerant ones...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{initiated}} to evaluate chemical disease management tools for Alternaria fruit rot on navel orange and Coniophora brown wood rot on lemon trees, examine the possible effect of branch diameter on development of Coniophora wood rot on lemon trees and continue evaluations of relative resistance of rootstocks to root rot and stem canker development when inoculated with P. citrophthora and P. parasitica. Rovral or Kocide {{did not significantly}} {{reduce the amount of}} Alternaria fruit rot on navel orange trees occurring in late summer and early autumn when applied during the preceding winter or spring months. Of several chemical treatments tested, only Nectec paste inhibited the development of Coniophora brown wood rot on inoculated lemon branches. The size of wood decay columns on branches 10 mm (0. 5 inch) in diameter were significantly smaller than those developing on branches 50 - 70 mm (2. 0 - 2. 75 inches) in diameter. In extensive trials evaluating root rot caused by Phytophthora citrophthora and P. parasitica, some relatively tolerant rootstocks were found among the group of new potential rootstocks as well as currently used rootstocks such as <b>rough</b> <b>lemon,</b> C. macrophylla and Troyer citrange. C. volkameriana was relatively tolerant to the development of root rot by P. citrophthora but demonstrated variable tolerance to P. parasitica. Comprehensive evaluation of stem canker development on citrus rootstocks inoculated with P. citrophthora or P. parasitica revealed that <b>rough</b> <b>lemon</b> is usually highly susceptible to both pathogens, while C. volkameriana was at times less susceptible (more tolerant) than <b>rough</b> <b>lemon</b> to both pathogens. Some of the new potential rootstocks were highly tolerant or resistant to infection of stem tissue by P. citrophthora or P. parasitica...|$|E
