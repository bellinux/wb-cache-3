2500|$|In industry, TNT is {{produced}} in a three-step process. First, toluene is nitrated {{with a mixture of}} sulfuric and nitric acid to produce mononitrotoluene (MNT). The MNT is separated and then renitrated to dinitrotoluene (DNT). In the final step, the DNT is nitrated to trinitrotoluene (TNT) using an anhydrous mixture of nitric acid and oleum. Nitric acid is consumed by the manufacturing process, but the diluted sulfuric acid can be reconcentrated and reused. [...] After nitration, TNT is stabilized by a process called sulfitation, where the crude TNT is treated with aqueous sodium sulfite solution to remove less stable isomers of TNT and other undesired reaction products. [...] The <b>rinse</b> <b>water</b> from sulphitation is known as red water and is a significant pollutant and waste product of TNT manufacture.|$|E
50|$|Some {{semiconductor}} manufacturing {{plants have been}} using reclaimed water for non-process applications such as chemical aspirators where the discharge water is sent to industrial waste. Water reclamation is also a typical application where spent <b>rinse</b> <b>water</b> from the manufacturing facility {{may be used in}} cooling tower supply, exhaust scrubber supply, or point of use abatement systems. UPW Recycling is not as typical and involves collecting the spent manufacturing <b>rinse</b> <b>water,</b> treating it and re-using it back in the wafer rinse process. Some additional water treatment may be required for any of these cases depending {{on the quality of the}} spent <b>rinse</b> <b>water</b> and the application of the reclaimed water. These are fairly common practices in many semiconductor facilities worldwide, however there is a limitation to how much water can be reclaimed and recycled if not considering reuse in the manufacturing process.|$|E
50|$|The key to maximizing water reclaim, recycle, and reuse {{is having}} a well thought out water {{management}} plan. A successful water management plan includes full {{understanding of how the}} <b>rinse</b> <b>waters</b> are used in the manufacturing process including chemicals used and their by products. With the development of this critical component, a drain collection system can be designed to segregate concentrated chemicals from moderately contaminated <b>rinse</b> <b>waters,</b> and lightly contaminated <b>rinse</b> <b>waters.</b> Once segregated into separate collection systems the once considered chemical process waste streams can be repurposed or sold as a product stream, and the <b>rinse</b> <b>waters</b> can be reclaimed.|$|R

30|$|The {{samples were}} stored in {{polyethylene}} bags after mining, ground in porcelain mortars, sieved to particle sizes of 0.1 – 2.5  mm, demineralized with HCl 0.5  N for 6  h, <b>rinsed</b> with distilled <b>water</b> until the pH {{of the resulting}} <b>rinsing</b> <b>water</b> was > 6, and dried at 105  °C for 2  h.|$|R
50|$|A water {{management}} plan will also require {{a significant amount}} of sample data and analysis to determine proper drain segregation, application of online analytical measurement, diversions control, and final treatment technology. Collecting these samples and performing laboratory analysis can help characterize the various waste streams and determine the potential of their respective re-use. In the case of UPW process <b>rinse</b> <b>water</b> the lab analysis data can then be used to profile typical and non-typical levels of contamination which then can be used to design the <b>rinse</b> <b>water</b> treatment system. In general it is most cost effective to design the system to treat the typical level of contamination that may occur 80-90% of the time, then incorporate on-line sensors and controls to divert the <b>rinse</b> <b>water</b> to industrial waste or to non-critical use such as cooling towers when the contamination level exceeds the capability of the treatment system. By incorporating all these aspects of a {{water management}} plan in a semiconductor manufacturing site the level of water use can be reduced by as much as 90%.|$|E

40|$|The brewing {{industry}} is a large consumer of groundwater for brewing, rinsing and cooling purposes. As regulations {{become more and more}} stringent and the cost of water increases, water recycling gains interest. This paper investigates the possibilities of nanofiltration for the treatment of brewery waste water streams in view of recycling. Four different water streams (waste water after biological treatment, bottle <b>rinsing</b> <b>water,</b> <b>rinsing</b> <b>water</b> of the brewing room and <b>rinsing</b> <b>water</b> of the bright beer reservoir) were filtered with four different nanofiltration membranes (UTC- 20, UTC- 60, Desal-HL- 51 and Desal- 5 -DK). The results for the biologically treated waste water were the most promising. For the other streams, rejection of organics was insufficient to obtain the required quality, mainly due to the high concentrations of organics such as ethanol in the feed water. Over the periods considered (3 h) only moderate flux decline (10 - 40 %) was observed for most membranes and feed solutions. For Desal- 5 -DK at high pH, an increase of the flux was observed.

40|$|A new {{membrane}} {{process is}} described {{that can be}} used to recoverplating chemicals from electroplating <b>rinse</b> <b>waters.</b> The process, called coupled transport, is based on liquid membranes that are comprised of a thin, polymeric microporous support containing a metal-ion complexing agent within the pores. Metal ions present in the rinse solutions are transported across these membranes and can be concentrated into a relatively small volume. The results of a small-scale field test are presented in which hollow-fiber coupled-transport membranes were used to recover chromium from chrome-plating <b>rinse</b> <b>waters.</b> The results of a 125 -day test are used as the basis of an economic analysis that predicts a I. 7 -year payback period for a full-sized coupledtransport unit...|$|R

50|$|The {{semiconductor}} industry uses {{a large amount}} of ultrapure water to rinse contaminants {{from the surface of the}} silicon wafers that are later turned into computer chips used in devices we use every day. The ultrapure water is by definition extremely low in contamination, but once it makes contact with the wafer surface it carries residual chemicals or particles from the surface that then end up in the industrial waste treatment system of the manufacturing facility. The contamination level of the <b>rinse</b> <b>water</b> can vary a great deal depending on the particular process step that is being rinsed at the time. A “first rinse” step may carry {{a large amount of}} residual contaminants and particles compared to a last rinse that may carry relatively low amounts of contamination. Typical semiconductor plants have only two drain systems for all of these rinses which are also combined with acid waste and therefore the <b>rinse</b> <b>water</b> is not effectively reused due to risk of contamination causing manufacturing process defects.|$|E

50|$|Recycling <b>rinse</b> <b>water</b> {{from the}} {{semiconductor}} manufacturing {{process has been}} discouraged by many manufacturing engineers for decades {{because of the risk}} that the contamination from the chemical residue and particles may end up back in the UPW feed water and result in product defects. Modern Ultrapure Water systems are very effective at removing ionic contamination down to parts per trillion levels (ppt) whereas organic contamination of ultrapure water systems is still in the parts per billion levels (ppb). In any case recycling the process water rinses for UPW makeup has always been a great concern and until recently this was not a common practice. Increasing water and wastewater costs in parts of the US and Asia have pushed some semiconductor companies to investigate the recycling of manufacturing process <b>rinse</b> <b>water</b> in the UPW makeup system. Some companies have incorporated an approach that uses complex large scale treatment designed for worst case conditions of the combined waste water discharge. More recently new approaches have been developed to incorporate a detailed water management plan to try to minimize the treatment system cost and complexity.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test in a short term {{laboratory}} experiment the accumulation and physiological effects of As in the epiphytic lichen Xanthoria parietina. Arsenic content in treated samples increased progressively with increasing concentration in treatment solutions. Treatment of X. parietina thalli with 0. 1, 1, 10 ppm As solutions caused significant decrease of viability, measured as intensity of respiratory activity, and damages to cell membranes, assessed by increase of electric conductivity of <b>rinsing</b> <b>water</b> and lipid peroxidation products. Soluble proteins content decreased and H(2) O(2) content increased already at the lowest As concentration tested (0. 01 ppm). Photosynthetic efficiency, measured in terms of F(V) /F(M) ratio, decreased significantly only at the highest As concentration (10 ppm). It was concluded that As exposure causes physiological stress both on the mycobiont and the photobiont and that cell membrane damage, expressed in terms of electric conductivity of <b>rinsing</b> <b>water,</b> is the parameter most affected by As treatment.
