5|$|Manganese {{overexposure}} is {{most frequently}} associated with manganism, a rare neurological disorder associated with excessive manganese ingestion or inhalation. Historically, persons {{employed in the}} production or processing of manganese alloys have been at <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> <b>developing</b> manganism; however, current health and safety regulations protect workers in developed nations. The disorder was first described in 1837 by British academic John Couper, who studied two patients who were manganese grinders.|$|E
5|$|Recent evidence, however, has {{suggested}} against {{the contention that}} the use of psilocybin puts one at <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> <b>developing</b> long lasting mental disorders.

5|$|In {{the view}} of the {{production}} team, Peggy's breast cancer was a catalyst, creating new dynamics and tensions amongst existing characters. Realism was also an issue. As a middle-aged woman, Peggy was epidemiologically at higher <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> <b>developing</b> breast cancer. In 2001, it was reported that Peggy's character was one of only a few media portrayals of older females to be given the disease, and source organisations have praised EastEnders for this.|$|E

5|$|Endometrial cancer appears most {{frequently}} during perimenopause (the period just before, just after, and during menopause), {{between the ages}} of 50 and 65; overall, 75% of endometrial cancer occurs after menopause. Women younger than 40 make up 5% of endometrial cancer cases and 10–15% of cases occur in women under 50years of age. This age group is at <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> <b>developing</b> ovarian cancer at the same time. The worldwide median age of diagnosis is 63years of age; in the United States, the average age of diagnosis is 60years of age. White American women are at higher risk for endometrial cancer than black American women, with a 2.88% and 1.69% lifetime risk respectively. Japanese-American women and American Latina women have a lower rates and Native Hawaiian women have higher rates.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive deficits {{that can}} follow TBI include {{impaired}} attention; disrupted insight, judgement, and thought; reduced processing speed; distractibility; and deficits in executive {{functions such as}} abstract reasoning, planning, problem-solving, and multitasking. Memory loss, the most common cognitive impairment among head-injured people, occurs in 20–79% of people with closed head trauma, depending on severity. People who have suffered TBI may also have difficulty with understanding or producing spoken or written language, or with more subtle aspects of communication such as body language. Post-concussion syndrome, a set of lasting symptoms experienced after mild TBI, can include physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioral problems such as headaches, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, and depression. Multiple TBIs may have a cumulative effect. A young person who receives a second concussion before symptoms from another one have healed may be at <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> <b>developing</b> a very rare but deadly condition called second-impact syndrome, in which the brain swells catastrophically after even a mild blow, with debilitating or deadly results. About one in five career boxers is affected by chronic traumatic brain injury (CTBI), which causes cognitive, behavioral, and physical impairments. Dementia pugilistica, the severe form of CTBI, affects primarily career boxers years after a boxing career. It commonly manifests as dementia, memory problems, and parkinsonism (tremors and lack of coordination).|$|E

5000|$|These {{percentages}} represent estimated relative increases {{over the}} baseline rates {{and are not}} absolute <b>risks</b> <b>for</b> <b>developing</b> such cancers. Due to the low baseline rates of thyroid cancer, even a large relative increase represents a small absolute increase in <b>risks.</b> <b>For</b> example, the baseline lifetime risk of thyroid cancer for females is just three-quarters of one percent and the additional lifetime risk estimated in this assessment for a female infant exposed in the most affected location is one-half of one percent.|$|R

30|$|Fanconi anaemia (FA) {{is a rare}} {{bone marrow}} failure disease leading to {{impaired}} DNA repair response. This disease also leads to haematologic changes. So far, mutations in 19 DNA damage response genes are known to either cause FA or increase the risk to have it (Bogliolo and Surrallés 2015). Depending on the affected genes, FA increases the <b>risks</b> <b>for</b> <b>developing</b> leukaemia, solid tumours, breast and ovarian cancer (Alter 2014; Bogliolo and Surrallés 2015).|$|R
25|$|The term {{developmental}} trauma disorder (DTD) {{has also}} been suggested. This developmental form of trauma places children at <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> <b>developing</b> psychiatric and medical disorders.
