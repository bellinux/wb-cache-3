This study aims to estimate the association between sun exposure as an indirectmeasure of vitamin D status at various age periods during childhood and adolescence and the risk of MS and to look for possible differences between Norway and Italy. Methods: The data for this study are from EnvIMS, a large multinational case-control study, and includes 733 cases and 1438 population based controls from Italy and 959 cases and 1718 population based controls from Norway. The exposure information was collected by means of a standardized self-administered questionnaire that included questions about sun habits during different periods in childhood and adolescence.

30|$|Spurious {{correlations}} between {{the emergence of a}} certain staffing pattern in a certain growth or dominance regime are only of concern if there is a significant heterogeneity with respect to a confounding factor related to both the staffing pattern and the regime of growth and dominance. We thereby concentrate on the three staffing patterns that display significant differences across regimes, according to our results in Table  3. Indeed, the finding that larger establishments with older and longer-tenured workforces rejuvenate more often, both by the inflow of younger and the outflow of older workers, and, at the same time, are less represented among growing firms, provides an alternative explanation for why growing firms rejuvenate less often than downsizing firms, as found in Table  3. However, the finding that growing and dominant establishments rejuvenate far more frequently, based on the inflow of younger workers, than growing dominated establishments should not be the result of a spurious correlation, as the <b>relevant</b> <b>confounding</b> <b>factors</b> are unrelated to the dominance regime (see Table A. 5).|$|E

40|$|Hormone {{replacement}} therapy (HRT) {{has been studied}} as a protective factor for cognitive decline and dementia. However, study findings have been inconsistent.

Using a large-scale, population-based, cohort study, we examined the relationship between HRT and cognition while paying particular attention to moderating and <b>confounding</b> <b>factors.</b> The main outcomes of interest were to assess differences in risk for cognitive impairments and dementia between HRT user and never user groups; examine HRT’s impact on age of onset of dementia; and explore the relationship between duration of HRT and cognitive decline. Logistic regression and Cox Proportional Hazards models were used to test HRT as a predictor for cognitive impairments, Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia, as well as to assess the effect of duration. Linear regression was used to consider the putative relationship between age at onset of dementia and HRT status. HRT use was found to be a statistically significant predictor for Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia. Overall, HRT use did not significantly predict for milder cognitive impairments, although significant interaction effects indicate that HRT may be protective at least for specific sub-groups of women. No durational effect was found for any of the outcomes. Neither did HRT appear to predict for age at onset of dementia.

30|$|Interestingly in this context, urocystitis was {{frequently}} {{observed in the}} present patient population. However, {{the extent to which}} chronic urocystitis can evolve to dysplasia and finally urothelial carcinoma is unclear. Recurrent infections can induce the development of bladder cancer, in particular squamous cell carcinoma. Especially patients with long-term urinary catheters or cystolithiasis are affected (Wynder and Goldsmith 1977). In a retrospective study by Otto et al. (2010), 7 % of patients with initial urocystitis developed bladder cancer during the follow-up period. Data of the present study may support this hypothesis as there was a strong association between urocystitis and a positive UroVysion test anticipating tumor manifestation (Laudadio et al. 2005; Gofrit et al. 2008). Additionally, the fact that no <b>relevant</b> <b>confounding</b> <b>factors</b> could be established regarding the UroVysion test in the UroScreen study support this hypothesis (Banek et al. 2012). Regarding the high number of positive NMP 22 test results during PDD examination they can most likely be explained by the mechanic manipulation in the urinary tract during cystoscopy or the intravesical instillation of HexvixR prior to the intervention. This can result in the release of NMP 22 due to an increased cell turnover (Poulakis et al. 2001; Konety 2006). For this reason these test results have to be interpreted with caution. Regarding Cyt, the high divergence between the two time points of examinations seems to be mainly attributed to the interobserver differences.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To discern {{behavioral}} problems that co-occur in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients, and {{to investigate the}} relation between behavioral clusters and the burden for caregivers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Baseline data of 63 FTD patients and their respective caregivers were used to detect the behavioral clusters in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and the accompanying distress evoked in caregivers. To detect the clusters in behavior of the FTD patients, we performed multidimensional scaling (procedure: PROXSCAL). Multiple regression {{analysis was used to}} determine the association between behavior of patients and the distress experienced by caregivers. RESULTS: This was the first study that found behavioral clusters for FTD. Two behavioral clusters were found: agitation/psychosis (comprising delusions, hallucinations, irritability and agitation) and mood (made up of anxiety and depression). The remaining NPI domains (euphoria, disinhibition, aberrant motor behavior and apathy were found to be autonomous. After controlling for <b>relevant</b> <b>confounding</b> <b>factors,</b> caregiver distress was strongest related to agitation/psychosis, followed by mood.

However, relatively less is known about the associations of walkability attributes with bicycle use for transport. We examined the relationships between adults ' bicycle use for transport and measures of neighborhood walkability in two settings: an Australian city (Adelaide) with low rates of bicycle use and a Belgian city (Ghent) with high rates of bicycle use. A total of 2, 159 and 382 participants were recruited in Adelaide and Ghent, respectively. A walkability index was derived from objectively measured data in Adelaide, while a similar index was derived from perceived measures in Ghent. Logistic regression models were employed to examine associations of bicycle use with different levels of walkability. There were higher rates of bicycle ownership for Ghent compared to Adelaide participants (96 % versus 61 %), and there was a higher prevalence of bicycle use for transport for Ghent compared to Adelaide participants (50 % vs. 14 %). Despite the large differences in bicycle ownership and use, living in a high-walkable neighborhood was associated with significantly higher odds of bicycle use for transport in both cities, after adjusting for <b>relevant</b> <b>confounding</b> <b>factors.</b> Built-environment innovations that are increasingly being advocated by health authorities and transport planners, primarily to promote higher rates of walking for transport, should also impact positively on bicycle use...|$|E

This study examined the cross-sectional relationships between markers of systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein, interleukins- 1 β, - 6, - 8, - 10, - 12, plasminogen activator inhibitor, serum amyloid A, tumour necrosis factor-α and vascular adhesion molecule- 1) and cognitive function in 873 non-demented community-dwelling elderly participants aged 70 - 90 years. Regression analyses were performed to determine the relationships between cognitive domains and inflammatory markers, controlling for age, sex, education, cardiovascular risk factors, obesity and other metabolic factors, smoking, alcohol consumption, depression and presence of the apolipoprotein ε 4 genotype. Regression analyses were repeated using four factors derived from a {{factor analysis of the}} cognitive tests. After Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, associations remained between raised levels of interleukin- 12 and reduced performance in processing speed. Marked sex differences were noted in the abovementioned findings, with only females being significantly affected. Using the four factors derived from the factor analyses of cognitive test as dependent variables, interleukins- 12 and - 6 were both associated with the processing speed/executive function factor, even after controlling for <b>relevant</b> <b>confounding</b> <b>factors.</b> Thus, markers of systemic inflammation are related to cognitive deficits in a non-clinical community-dwelling elderly population, independent of depression, cardiovascular or metabolic risk factors, or presence of apolipoprotein ε 4 genotype.

30|$|The {{generalized}} {{propensity score}} is a balancing score (Hirano and Imbens 2004; Imai and van Dyk 2004) when the model specification is appropriate. In other words, when observations are grouped into subsets with similar propensity scores, covariates within a subset should be similar among different treatment levels when the model used to derive the scores is appropriate. We use this expectation {{to verify the}} adequacy of the model specification. Hirano and Imbens (2004) proposed the use of a standardized difference to measure the balance in two steps. First, data were grouped into a number of categories (e.g., three) based on log TN (the treatment), each with roughly the same sample size. To show the balance in a <b>confounding</b> <b>factor,</b> we compare the means of the <b>confounding</b> <b>factor</b> among the three categories. The comparison can be made using a standardized difference, the difference of the means in the two categories divided by the standard error of the difference. The standard difference is similar to the t statistics in a two-sample t test. This comparison is first carried out directly to the data without GPS adjustment to illustrate the imbalance in the data. After calculating the propensity scores, we then divide the data into subsets of similar propensity scores and repeat the process of comparing <b>confounding</b> <b>factors</b> among three log TN categories within each relatively homogeneous subset of data. That is, in the second step, the data were divided into a number of subsets based on the calculated propensity scores (<b>confounding</b> <b>factors</b> are balanced within each subset), and within each subset, we further divide the data based on the treatment (log TN) to calculate the standardized mean differences of each <b>confounding</b> <b>factor.</b> The weighted averages of these standardized mean differences are known as the GPS-adjusted mean differences (Hirano and Imbens 2004). Weights of each subset are determined by the subset sample sizes. When the standardized differences of a <b>confounding</b> <b>factor</b> are between −[*] 2 and 2, we consider that the <b>confounding</b> <b>factor</b> is balanced. Through comparing the change in the standardized differences calculated from the two steps, we can show the improvement in terms of <b>confounding</b> <b>factor</b> balance due to propensity score.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} neuropsychological {{function}} characterized {{in subjects with}} chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) {{at the same time}} controlling for <b>relevant</b> <b>confounding</b> <b>factors.</b> CFS is associated with symptoms of neuropsychological dysfunction. Objective measures of neuropsychological performance have yielded inconsistent results possibly due to sample selection bias, diagnostic heterogeneity, comorbid psychiatric disorders, and medication usage. METHOD: CFS subjects (n = 58) and well controls (n = 104) from a population-based sample were evaluated, using standardized symptom severity criteria. Subjects who had major psychiatric disorders or took medications known to influence cognition were excluded. Neuropsychological function was measured using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). RESULTS: Compared with controls, CFS subjects exhibited significant decreases in motor speed as measured in the simple and five-choice movement segments of the CANTAB reaction time task. CFS subjects also exhibited alterations in working memory as manifested by a less efficient search strategy on the spatial working memory task, fewer % correct responses on the spatial recognition task, and prolonged latency to a correct response on the pattern recognition task. A significantly higher percentage of CFS subjects versus controls exhibited evidence of neuropsychological impairment (defined by performance 1 standard deviation below the CANTAB normative mean) in tasks of motor speed and spatial working memory. Impairment in CFS subjects versus control subjects ranged from 20 % versus 4. 8 % in five-choice movement time (p =. 002) to 27. 8 % versus 10. 6 % in search strategy on the spatial working memory task (p =. 006). CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm and quantify alterations in motor speed and working memory in CFS subjects independent of comorbid psychiatric disease and medication usage...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{cognitive}} impairment in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by executive dysfunction, rather than memory dysfunction, although the precise mechanism of this remains to be elucidated. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to examine the correlation between gray matter volume (GMV) and executive function in CKD patients. This cross-sectional study recruited 95 patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD (NDD-CKD) with no history of cerebrovascular disease, who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Trail Making Test (TMT) in the VCOHP Study. The subjects underwent brain MRI and TMT part A (TMT-A) and part B (TMT-B). The segmentation algorithm from Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 software was applied to every T 1 -weighted MRI scan to extract tissue maps corresponding to gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. GMV was normalized by dividing by the total intracranial volume, calculated by adding GMV, white matter volume, and cerebrospinal fluid space volume. Then, normalized whole-brain GMV was divided into four categories of brain lobes; frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital. We assessed the correlation between normalized GMV and TMT using multivariable regression analysis. Normalized whole-brain GMV was significantly inversely correlated to the scores of TMT-A, TMT-B, and ΔTMT (TMT-B minus TMT-A). These correlations remained significant even after adjusting for <b>relevant</b> <b>confounding</b> <b>factors.</b> Normalized frontal and temporal GMV, but not parietal and occipital GMV, were significantly inversely correlated with TMT-A, TMT-B, and ΔTMT using multivariable regression analysis. The present study demonstrates the correlation between normalized GMV, especially in the frontal and temporal lobes, and executive function, suggesting that fronto-temporal gray matter atrophy might contribute to executive dysfunction in NDD-CKD...|$|E
40|$|Human Growth Hormone (hGH, somatotropin) {{is one of}} the {{relevant}} forbidden substances to be detected in sport drug testing. Since the appearance of recombinant hGH (rhGH) in the 80 's, its expansion and availability through the black market have increased, so the detection of its abuse continues to be a challenge at present. New techniques or biomarkers that are robust, reliable, sensitive and allowing a large detection time window are welcome. rhGH produces an increase of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF- 1). FN 1 (fibronectin 1) and RAB 31 (member of RAS oncogene family) genes have been suggested as two potential biomarkers for IGF- 1 abuse. Following this line, in the present study some genetic and proteomic approaches have been performed with fourteen healthy male subjects treated with rhGH (which produces increase of IGF- 1 concentrations) to study FN 1 gene, FN 1 protein, RAB 31 gene and RAB 31 protein as potential biomarkers for rhGH abuse. The results showed that both, RAB 31 and FN 1 genes and FN 1 protein could be potential biomarkers for rhGH administration. Preliminary assessments of gender, age, acute sport activities and GHRP- 2 (pralmorelin, a rhGH releasing peptide) influence suggest they are not <b>relevant</b> <b>confounding</b> <b>factors.</b> Thus, the selected markers present high sensitivity and a larger detection window for rhGH detection than IGF- 1 itself.
