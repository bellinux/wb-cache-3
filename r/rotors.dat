5|$|Composite {{materials}} make up 43% of the airframe, and the proprotor blades {{also use}} composites. For storage, the V-22's <b>rotors</b> fold in 90 seconds and its wing rotates to align, front-to-back, with the fuselage. Due to {{the requirement for}} folding <b>rotors,</b> their 38-foot diameter is 5 feet less than optimal for vertical takeoff, resulting in high disk loading. Most missions use fixed wing flight 75% {{or more of the}} time, reducing wear and tear and operational costs. This fixed wing flight is higher than typical helicopter missions allowing longer range line-of-sight communications for improved command and control.|$|E

40|$|Acoustic {{measurements}} were obtained in a Langley 14 x 22 foot Subsonic Wind Tunnel {{to study the}} aeroacoustic interaction of 1 / 5 th scale main <b>rotor,</b> tail <b>rotor,</b> and fuselage models. An extensive aeroacoustic data base was acquired for main <b>rotor,</b> tail <b>rotor,</b> fuselage aerodynamic interaction for moderate forward speed flight conditions. The details of the <b>rotor</b> models, experimental design and procedure, aerodynamic and acoustic data acquisition and reduction are presented. The model was initially operated in trim for selected fuselage angle of attack, main <b>rotor</b> tip-path-plane angle, and main <b>rotor</b> thrust combinations. The effects of repositioning the tail <b>rotor</b> in the main <b>rotor</b> wake and the corresponding tail <b>rotor</b> countertorque requirements were determined. Each <b>rotor</b> was subsequently tested in isolation at the thrust and angle of attack combinations for trim. The acoustic data indicated that the noise was primarily dominated by the main <b>rotor,</b> especially for moderate speed main <b>rotor</b> blade-vortex interaction conditions. The tail <b>rotor</b> noise increased when the main <b>rotor</b> was removed indicating that tail <b>rotor</b> inflow was improved with the main <b>rotor</b> present...|$|R
5|$|In the 1970s, Westland's {{experience}} with the Sea King led the company to conduct the British Experimental Rotor Program (BERP), in coordination with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, which applied innovations in composite materials and new design principles to the helicopter rotor. Initial trials carried out with active Sea Kings found several advantages to the BERP rotor, including a longer fatigue life and improved aerodynamic characteristics. Subsequent Westland helicopters, such as the record-breaking Lynx and the AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin, took advantage of BERP <b>rotors</b> for greater performance. Westland equipped later-built Sea Kings with the new composite <b>rotors</b> as well.|$|E
5|$|Before {{receiving}} the French intelligence material, Rejewski {{had made a}} careful study of Enigma messages, particularly of the first six letters of messages intercepted on a single day. For security, each message was encrypted using different starting positions of the <b>rotors,</b> as selected by the operator. This message setting was three letters long. To convey it to the receiving operator, the sending operator began the message by sending the message setting in a disguised form — a six-letter indicator. The indicator was formed using the Enigma with its <b>rotors</b> set to a common global setting for that day, termed the ground setting, which was shared by all operators. The particular way that the indicator was constructed introduced a weakness into the cipher.|$|E
5|$|Both the Zygalski-sheet {{method and}} each bomba worked {{for only a}} single {{scrambler}} rotor order, so six sets of Zygalski sheets and six bomby were produced. However, the Germans introduced two new <b>rotors</b> on 15 December 1938, giving a choice of three out of five to assemble in the machines on a given day. This {{increased the number of}} possible rotor orders from 6 to 60. The Biuro could then only read the small minority of messages that used neither of the two new <b>rotors.</b> They did not have the resources to produce 54 more bomby or 54 sets of Zygalski sheets. Fortunately, however, the fact that the SD network was still using the old method of the same indicator setting for all messages, allowed Rejewski to re-use his previous method of working out the wiring within these <b>rotors.</b> This information was essential for the production of a full set Zygalski sheets which allowed resumption of large-scale decryption in January 1940. On 1 January 1939, the Germans made military Enigma even more difficult to break by increasing the number of plugboard connections from between five and eight, to between seven and ten.|$|E
40|$|An {{integrated}} electrostatically-controlled micromechanical gyroscope with a <b>rotor</b> encompassed {{within a}} <b>rotor</b> cavity and electrostatically spun within the cavity. The gyroscope includes {{a plurality of}} axial electrostatic <b>rotor</b> actuators {{above and below the}} <b>rotor</b> for controlling the axial and tilt position of the <b>rotor</b> within the cavity, and a plurality of radial electrostatic actuators spaced circumferentially around the <b>rotor</b> for controlling the radial and tilt position of the <b>rotor</b> within the cavity.

50|$|One of the {{problems}} with any single set of <b>rotor</b> blades is the torque (rotational force) exerted on the helicopter fuselage in the direction opposite to the <b>rotor</b> blades. This torque causes the fuselage to rotate in the direction opposite to the <b>rotor</b> blades. In single <b>rotor</b> helicopters, the antitorque <b>rotor</b> or tail <b>rotor</b> counteracts the main <b>rotor</b> torque and controls the fuselage rotation.|$|R

5|$|For example, {{suppose the}} {{operator}} chose the message setting KYG for a message. The operator would first set the Enigma's <b>rotors</b> {{to the ground}} setting, which might be GBL on that particular day, and then encrypt the message setting on the Enigma twice; that is, the operator would enter KYGKYG (which might come out to something like QZKBLX). The operator would then reposition the <b>rotors</b> at KYG, and encrypt the actual message. A receiving operator could reverse the process to recover first the message setting, then the message itself. The repetition of the message setting was apparently meant as an error check to detect garbles, but it had the unforeseen effect of greatly weakening the cipher. Due to the indicator's repetition of the message setting, Rejewski knew that, in the plaintext of the indicator, the first and fourth letters were the same, the second and fifth were the same, and the third and sixth were the same. These relations could be exploited {{to break into the}} cipher.|$|E
5|$|In its design, the XR-1 bore {{a strong}} {{resemblance}} to the Focke-Wulf Fw 61, a helicopter developed by Henrich Focke in Germany that, flown by Hanna Reitsch, had impressed Platt-LePage co-founder Wynn LePage during a tour of Europe. The XR-1 was powered by a Pratt & Whitney R-985 radial engine, mounted in a buried installation within the fuselage. The aircraft had two, three-bladed <b>rotors,</b> mounted in a side-by-side arrangement on wing-like pylons. The pylons were aerodynamically designed to produce some lift when in forwards flight, slightly unloading the <b>rotors.</b> The construction of the XR-1 was conventional {{by the standards of}} the time, with the aircraft's frame consisting of a steel-tube framework, which was covered with fabric. The XR-1 had tail surfaces similar to those of a conventional aircraft, and was equipped with a fixed, taildragger landing gear. The aircraft's wheels freely castered for easier maneuvering on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The cyclometer {{comprised}} {{two sets}} of Enigma <b>rotors,</b> and {{was used to determine}} the length and number of cycles of the permutations that could be generated by the Enigma machine. Even with the cyclometer, preparing the catalog was a long and difficult task. Each position of the Enigma machine (there were 17,576 positions) had to be examined for each possible sequence of <b>rotors</b> (there were 6 possible sequences); therefore, the catalog comprised 105,456 entries. Preparation of the catalog took over a year, but when it was ready about 1935, it made obtaining daily keys a matter of 12–20 minutes. However, on 1 or 2 November 1937, the Germans replaced the reflector in their Enigma machines, which meant that the entire catalog had to be recalculated from scratch. Nonetheless, by January 1938 the Cipher Bureau's German section was reading a remarkable 75% of Enigma intercepts, and according to Rejewski, with a minimal increase in personnel this could have been increased to 90%.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} made of {{helicopter}} tail <b>rotor</b> noise, particularly that due to interactions with the main <b>rotor</b> tip vortices, and with the fuselage separation mean wake. The tail <b>rotor</b> blade-main <b>rotor</b> tip vortex interaction is modelled as an airfoil of infinite span cutting through a moving vortex. The vortex and the geometry information required by the analyses are obtained through a free wake geometry analysis of the main <b>rotor.</b> The acoustic pressure-time histories for the tail <b>rotor</b> blade-vortex interactions are then calculated. These acoustic results are compared to tail <b>rotor</b> loading and thickness noise, and {{are found to be}} significant to the overall tail <b>rotor</b> noise generation. Under most helicopter operating conditions, large acoustic pressure fluctuations can be generated due to a series of skewed main <b>rotor</b> tip vortices passing through the tail <b>rotor</b> disk. The noise generation depends strongly upon the helicopter operating conditions and the location of the tail <b>rotor</b> relative to the main <b>rotor...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} of distortions of the <b>rotor</b> exit flow field {{caused by an}} aerodynamic probe mounted in the <b>rotor</b> is described in this paper. A <b>rotor</b> total pressure Kiel probe, mounted on the <b>rotor</b> hub and extending up to the mid-span radius of a <b>rotor</b> blade channel, generates a wake that forms additional flow blockage. Three types of high-response aerodynamic probes were used to investigate the distorted flow field behind the <b>rotor.</b> These probes were: a split-fiber thermo-anemometric probe to measure velocity and flow direction, a total pressure probe, and a disk probe for in-flow static pressure measurement. The signals acquired from these high-response probes were reduced using an ensemble averaging method based on a once per <b>rotor</b> revolution signal. The <b>rotor</b> ensemble averages were combined to construct contour plots for each <b>rotor</b> channel of the <b>rotor</b> tested. In order to quantify the <b>rotor</b> probe effects, the contour plots for each individual <b>rotor</b> blade passage were averaged into a single value. The distribution of these average values along the <b>rotor</b> circumference {{is a measure of}} changes in the <b>rotor</b> exit flow field due to the presence of a probe in the <b>rotor.</b> These distributions were generated for axial flow velocity and for static pressure...|$|R
5|$|To decrypt Enigma messages, {{three pieces}} of {{information}} were needed: (1) a general understanding of how Enigma functioned; (2) the wiring of the rotors; and (3) the daily settings (the sequence and orientations of the <b>rotors,</b> and the plug connections on the plugboard). Rejewski had only the first at his disposal, based on information already acquired by the Cipher Bureau.|$|E

If a proprotor gearbox fails, that proprotor cannot be feathered, and both engines must be stopped before an emergency landing. The V-22's autorotation characteristics are poor partly because the <b>rotors</b> have low inertia.|$|E

5|$|At this point, Rejewski {{ran into}} {{difficulties}} {{due to the}} large number of unknowns in the set of equations that he had developed. He would later comment in 1980 that it was still not known whether such a set of six equations was soluble without further data. But he was assisted by cryptographic documents that Section D of French military intelligence (the Deuxième Bureau), under future General Gustave Bertrand, had obtained and passed on to the Polish Cipher Bureau. The documents, procured from a spy in the German Cryptographic Service, Hans-Thilo Schmidt, included the Enigma settings for the months of September and October 1932. About 9 or 10 December 1932, the documents were given to Rejewski. They enabled him {{to reduce the number of}} unknowns and solve the wirings of the <b>rotors</b> and reflector.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, Charles H.

Known as kinesthetic control, and similar in principle to the mechanics of riding a bicycle or a surfboard, it was hoped that the concept would allow for pilots to operate an aircraft with little to no training time. NACA testing proved that the idea had merit, and several companies, including Bensen Aircraft, Hiller Aircraft, and de Lackner Helicopters, began development of rotorcraft using the concept.|$|E

40|$|In this work, a {{compressible}} Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) solver is used {{to investigate}} the aerodynamics of a micro-scale coaxial <b>rotor</b> configuration in hover; in order to evaluate the predictive capa-bility of the computational approach and to characterize the unsteadiness in the aerodynamic flow-field of the small-scale coaxial systems. The overall performance is well predicted {{for a range of}} RPMs and <b>rotor</b> spacing. As the <b>rotor</b> spacing increases, the top <b>rotor</b> thrust increases and the bottom <b>rotor</b> thrust decreases, while the total thrust remain fairly constant. The thrusts approach a constant value at very large <b>rotor</b> spacing. Top <b>rotor</b> contributes to about 55 % of the total thrust at smaller <b>rotor</b> spacing, which increases to about 58 % at the largest <b>rotor</b> separation. The interaction between the <b>rotor</b> systems is seen to generate significant impulses in the instantaneous thrust and power. Unsteadiness is mainly caused due to blade loading and wake effect. Additional high frequency unsteadiness was also seen due to shedding near the trailing edge. The phasing of the top vortex impingement upon the bottom <b>rotor</b> plays {{a significant role in the}} amount of unsteadiness for the the bottom <b>rotor.</b> Interaction of top <b>rotor</b> vortex and inboard sheet with the bottom <b>rotor</b> results in a highly three-dimensional shedding on the upper surface of the blade in the outboard region and a two-dimensional shedding on the lower surface at the inboard portion of the blade.

In addition, the HZ-1 proved to be faster than other flying platform designs evaluated by the Army. Sundby, however, quickly determined that the craft was {{much more difficult to}} fly than had been expected, and would not be safe {{in the hands of an}} inexperienced pilot.

5|$|The Leslie was {{originally}} designed to mimic the complex tones and constantly shifting sources of sound emanating from {{a large group of}} ranks in a pipe organ. The effect varies depending on the speed of the <b>rotors,</b> which can be toggled between fast (tremolo) and slow (chorale) using a console half-moon or pedal switch, with the most distinctive effect occurring as the speaker rotation speed changes.

The Pro-Line series of Leslies which were made to be portable for gigging bands using solid-state amps were popular during the 1970s.|$|E
