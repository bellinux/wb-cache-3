5|$|After {{some time}} away from TV, Ziggler {{returned}} on the August 22 edition of SmackDown Live to declare that he would undergo a gimmick change on the following week's edition. He later started mocking, week after week, the entrances of current and former wrestlers such as John Cena, Naomi, Shawn Michaels and Randy Savage. Ziggler believed that fans only cared about elaborated entrances, and not about the in-ring performances, where he claimed he was the best. However, after mocking The Undertaker's entrance, Ziggler was interrupted by Bobby Roode, who challenged Ziggler to a match at Hell in a Cell, which Ziggler accepted. At the event Ziggler, who had promised a never seen before entrance but ended up being an entrance with no music, lights and titantron, was defeated by Roode after a Roll Up; <b>right</b> <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> Ziggler attacked Roode from behind with a Zig Zag. On the October 17 edition of SmackDown Live, Ziggler defeated Roode in a rematch by a roll up, similar to how Roode defeated him. On 31st October's edition of Smackdown, Ziggler failed to earn a spot in Team Smackdown for Survivor Series 5 on 5 elimination match vs Raw after being defeated by Roode in a 2 out of 3 falls match and thus ending their feud.|$|E

However, [...] "he did get many aspects right," [...] she said, citing the scene in which a sleeping Cobb is shoved into a full bath, and in the dream world water gushes into {{the windows of the}} building, waking him up.

[...] Original drummer Lombardo would use two bass drums (instead of a double pedal, which is used on a single bass drum). Lombardo's speed and aggression earned him the title of the [...] "godfather of double bass" [...] by Drummerworld. Lombardo stated his reasons for using two bass drums: [...] "When you hit the bass drum, the head is still resonating. When you hit it in the same place <b>right</b> <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> you kinda get a 'slapback' from the bass drum head hitting the other pedal. You're not letting them breathe."

500|$|The artwork of Gunnerkrigg Court {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "stylized," [...] with simple character designs."What he did was make an intentional choice to make his characters very cartoony." [...] At least one reviewer, on the other hand, has noticed that the backgrounds, in contrast to the characters, are often very elaborate."His characters are really simple, and some of his backgrounds are really complicated." [...] The comic has also been described as having a [...] "rich" [...] look in spite of its limited color palette,"I love his use of color, too, in particular, because he never has more than like ten colors on the average page, but it looks really really rich." [...] and Siddell himself has stated that he first developed the idea for the comic using {{only a limited number of}} colors.Siddell: [...] "I did another sketch <b>right</b> <b>after</b> <b>that</b> of the same girl and, wanting to color it but only having a very limited selection of marker pens, put her in an ugly school uniform with some crazy makeup."

500|$|People {{are always}} {{using the word}} Illuminati but they're always {{referencing}} it in an incorrect way. People often accuse me of {{being a member of}} the Illuminati and I think in today's pop culture the Illuminati is perceived as a group of powerful, successful people who are working behind the scenes to control the universe. Not people with consciousness, not people who are enlightened. So people were accusing me of {{being a member of the}} Illuminati, and I kept going, wait—so first I had to figure out what that meant...I know who the real Illuminati are, and I know where that word comes from. The real Illuminati were a group of scientists, artists, philosophers, writers, who came about in what is referred to as the Age of Enlightenment, after the Dark Ages, when there was no writing and no art and no creativity and no spirituality, and life was really at a standstill. And <b>right</b> <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> everything flourished. So we had people like Shakespeare and Leonardo Da Vinci and Michaelangelo and Isaac Newton, and all these great minds and great thinkers, and they were called Illuminati...It had nothing to do with money and power. Of course they were powerful, because they influenced people. But their goal was to inspire and enlighten. So when people refer to me as a member of the Illuminati, I always want to say thank you. Thank you for putting me in that category.|$|E

2500|$|Further studies {{tried to}} {{understand}} the behaviors and roles of each person during the interaction {{through a series of}} three studies. In the first two experiments, subjects were invited to watch a short film (non-emotional, moderate and intense emotional conditions) while their partner (a real friend) was given a non-stimulating task to complete. <b>Right</b> <b>after</b> <b>that,</b> they were put in the same room together while they waited for {{the second part of the}} experiment. [...] During this time, their conversation was recorded in order to analyze it for any manifestations of social sharing. In these studies, the duration of social sharing was significantly higher in the intense emotion condition than in the non-emotional and moderate emotion conditions, and was the only condition in which social sharing was substantial enough to justify calculating the individual contributions of targets and partners to the social sharing process. Consistent with the hypothesis that a person exposed to an emotion would socially share it, targets contributed to the social sharing component of the conversation to a much greater extent than did partners (81.8% and 18.2% of the time, respectively).|$|E
2500|$|Foley {{appeared}} as a color commentator at WWE's ECW One Night Stand, which aired on June 12, 2005, and subsequently renewed his contract with WWE. Foley returned in 2005 in a match where fans were able to vote on which persona he would appear as—Mankind, Dude Love, or Cactus Jack—against Carlito at Taboo Tuesday.

This was the first WWE heel turn (and his final heel turn) of Foley since his feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin as Dude Love in 1998. This was also his first heel run under his real name. Also during that time he changed his [...] "thrilled to be here" [...] catch phrase into a more heelish type way.
