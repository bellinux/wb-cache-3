Seminal vesicle-rectal fistulas, the second type, have only been reported in very few cases. Kitazawa et al. reported 10 cases of seminal vesicle-rectal fistulas, and they defined rarely encountered complications [7]. In contrast, rectourethral fistula is one of the complications that occur after prostatectomy in the urologic discipline. There have been no previous reports describing a rectourethral fistula after ISR, as there is little available information in the gastroenterological surgery discipline.|$|R

Aim. Genitourinary fistulas are bothersome clinical entities {{not only for the}} patient but also for the treating surgeon as well. A lot of surgical procedures have been proposed; however, most of the fistulas can be easily treated with plain surgical techniques, such as the simple surgical closure of the fistula tract. Material and Method. The study was carried out in the urogynecology department of Ankara Etlik Zübeyde HanımMaternity Training and Research Hospital. The study included 12 cases with vesicovaginal fistulas and 15 cases with <b>rectovaginal</b> <b>fistulas.</b> Twenty-six patients underwent simple surgical closure technique. The age, the referral time to the hospital, the longest diameter of the fistula opening, the hospitalization time, the follow-up period and identifiable risk factors of the patients were evaluated. Results. Caeserean section was detected as primary risk factor for vesicovaginal fistulas and prolonged labor was detected as the most important risk factor for <b>rectovaginal</b> <b>fistulas.</b> In our study, we found that the simple closure technique cured 91 % of vesicovaginal fistulas and 93 % of <b>rectovaginal</b> <b>fistulas.</b> Conclusion.

Methods: Eighty-seven women with genital fistulae were managed between January 1988 and December 2002. Sixty-eight cases were urogenital and 19 were <b>rectovaginal</b> <b>fistulae.</b> Three women had concomitant urogenital and <b>rectovaginal</b> <b>fistulae.</b> The position of patients for surgery and the route of repair were individualized according to the appropriate access to the fistulae.

30|$|The largest casuistry of {{colorectal}} resections by laparoscopy with 436 {{cases was}} published {{this year by}} the group in Verona [56].

The same authors published a previous report in 2009. In this publication, 357 cases were followed up for 20  months showing a recurrence rate of symptomatology of 6.3 % and a recurrence rate of endometriosic nodules in 3.5 % of the patients [27]. When they compared these results to those obtained after laparotomic colorectal resection, they found a similar rate of complications [51]. Keckstein and Weisinger [25] found a 7.4 % complications rate and Daraï et al. [26] reported a 10 % complications rate, with 6 % being <b>rectovaginal</b> <b>fistulas.</b> When the laparotomic approach is used, Dousset et al.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the diagnostic accuracy of MRI, comparing STIR images versus T 1 w post-contrast fat-sat images in patients affected by perianal Crohn’s disease (CD).

50|$|<b>Rectovaginal</b> <b>fistula</b> may be {{extremely}} debilitating. If the opening between the rectum and vagina is wide {{it will allow}} both flatulence and feces to escape through the vagina, leading to fecal incontinence.

Either conditions can lead to labial fusion. This type of fistula can cause pediatricians to misdiagnose imperforate anus. The severity of the symptoms {{will depend on the}} size of fistula.

40|$|Introduction: Patients with {{cervical}} carcinoma that {{invade the}} bladder or rectum (International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology stage IVA) {{have a high}} risk to develop vesicovaginal and/or <b>rectovaginal</b> <b>fistulae.</b> If we could identify pretreatment factors that predict fistula formation, these patients could be offered less debilitating treatment. Materials and Methods: Data were retrieved from the database of consecutive patients diagnosed with stage IVA cervical cancer from 1992 to 2008. Overall survival and fistula-free survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to study the association between pretreatment prognostic variables and fistula formation. Results: Thirty patients with stage IVA cervical cancer were diagnosed. Extension to the bladder was present in 27 patients; three patients had only rectal involvement. Twenty-three patients (77 %) had curative radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy and/or hyperthermia. Seven patients (23 %) received only palliative therapy or no treatment at all. The 5 -year overall survival in the curatively treated group was 42 %. Five (22 %) of these 23 patients developed one or more fistulae: 3 vesicovaginal, 1 rectovaginal, and 1 vesicovaginal and <b>rectovaginal</b> <b>fistulae.</b> The 5 -year fistula-free survival of this group was 64 %.

PRESENTATION OF CASEWe present a 45 -year-old female that presented with complaints of stool per vagina and was found to have a rectal vaginal fistula near the vaginal cuff from her previous uncomplicated vaginal hysterectomy. The patient was originally scheduled for a complex open abdominal surgery based on examination but underwent a sigmoidoscopy with vaginal examination and identified a small opening with minimal inflammation. The patient was treated with Bioglue® and had complete resolution of the fistula at follow-up. DISCUSSIONThere are numerous cases presented in the literature on the use of bioglue for anal <b>fistulas</b> and <b>rectovaginal</b> <b>fistulas</b> with multiple cases of success. However, in looking at the literature failure appears to be due to ongoing inflammation from the previous disease process.
