5|$|Howe and Queen Charlotte led {{the fleet}} by example, sailing {{directly}} at the French flagship Montagne. Passing between Montagne and the next in line Vengeur du Peuple, Queen Charlotte <b>raked</b> both and hauled up close to Montagne {{to engage in a}} close-range artillery battle. As she did so, Queen Charlotte also became briefly entangled with Jacobin, and exchanged fire with her too, causing serious damage to both French ships.|$|E
5|$|Newman and Copland led {{the charge}} from the old town across a bridge <b>raked</b> by machine gun fire and {{advanced}} into the new town. The Commandos attempted {{to get through the}} narrow streets of the town and into the surrounding countryside, but were eventually surrounded. When their ammunition was expended their only option was to surrender. Not all the Commandos were captured; five men reached neutral Spain, from where they eventually returned to England.|$|E

5000|$|Large [...] "mechanized" [...] {{versions}} of <b>rakes</b> {{are used in}} farming, called hay <b>rakes,</b> are built in many different forms (e.g. star-wheel <b>rakes,</b> rotary <b>rakes</b> etc.). Non-mechanized farming may be done with various forms of a hand <b>rake.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Rake</b> {{angle is}} a {{parameter}} used in various cutting and machining processes, describing {{the angle of}} the cutting face relative to the work. There are two <b>rake</b> angles, namely the back <b>rake</b> angle and side <b>rake</b> angle, both of which help to guide chip flow. There are three types of <b>rake</b> angles: positive, negative, and zero.|$|R
5|$|The 5th Division {{attacked}} {{with three}} battalions through the Scherriabeek valley, which were <b>raked</b> by fire from Gheluvelt {{and found the}} valley to be impassable. Polderhoek Château was captured but then relinquished because many weapons were clogged by mud and the position made an awkward salient. The Germans promptly reoccupied the château, swept the area to the west with massed machine-gun fire and counterattacked, which pushed the brigade back to the start line.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} contains three sandstone fireplaces, and the countertops {{are finished}} with hand-painted tiles from Mexico. Myrtlewood is used inside as trim and for doors. Bedroom closets were constructed with drawers, shelves, and ironing boards built-in. Inside the two-level building are amenities such as dumbwaiters and a sewing room. On the outside <b>raked</b> cedar was {{used on the}} eaves of the low-pitched roof-line building. The exterior sandstone is tan, rose, and blue in color.|$|E
5|$|Virgil Hodge {{was placed}} in heat four, {{competing}} against athletes like Jamaica's Sherone Simpson and the United States' Muna Lee. She ran her event in 23.17seconds, earning fifth of eight in her heat and falling 0.02seconds behind Bulgaria's Ivet Lalova. Overall, however, Hodge <b>raked</b> 19th out of 31. Hodge fell short of Simpson, who ranked first in quarterfinals, by 0.57seconds.|$|E
5|$|Weeding rakes: As weeding was a {{constant}} issue in the ancient and medieval Chinese agricultural process, {{it led to the}} invention of the weeding <b>rake.</b> The invention of the Chinese weed <b>rake</b> is derived from the invention of the Chinese harrow. In the Chinese agricultural text Qimin Yaoshu written by the Northern Wei Dynasty official Jia Sixie. Harrows were originally called iron-teeth <b>rakes</b> due to its shaping. According to it's shape, the Chinese harrow was divided into three sub-classifications: Strip <b>rake,</b> Y-shaped <b>rake,</b> and square <b>rake.</b> The harrows seen in the murals of the Wei and Jin Dynasties are strip <b>rakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The typical early horse-drawn hay <b>rake</b> was a dump <b>rake,</b> a wide two-wheeled {{implement}} with curved {{steel or}} iron teeth usually operated from a seat mounted over the <b>rake</b> with a lever-operated lifting mechanism. This <b>rake</b> gathered cut hay into windrows by repeated operation {{perpendicular to the}} windrow, requiring the operator to raise the <b>rake,</b> turn around and drop the teeth to <b>rake</b> {{back and forth in}} order to form the windrow. In some areas, a sweep <b>rake,</b> which could also be a horse-drawn or tractor-mounted implement, could then be used to pick up the windrowed hay and load it onto a wagon.|$|R
40|$|Conventional MMSE <b>Rake</b> and Adaptive MMSE <b>rake</b> {{are used}} for WCDMA. In this paper we {{observed}} that the BER performance of the Adoptive MMSE <b>Rake</b> receiver gives better result in WCDMA. The comparative analysis proved that the Adaptive MMSE <b>Rake</b> Receiver {{is much better than}} Conventional <b>Rake</b> Receiver. Both Genetic Algorithm (GA) and as well as Conventional algorithm are derived for WCDMA environment...|$|R
5|$|Admiral Hipper {{was ordered}} by the Kriegsmarine from the Blohm & Voss {{shipyard}} in Hamburg. Her keel was laid on 6 July 1935, under construction number 246. The ship was launched on 6 February 1937, and was completed on 29 April 1939, {{the day she was}} commissioned into the German fleet. The Commander-in-Chief of the Kriegsmarine, Großadmiral (Grand Admiral) Erich Raeder, who had been Franz von Hipper's chief of staff during World War I, gave the christening speech and his wife Erika Raeder performed the christening. As built, the ship had a straight stem, though after her launch this was replaced with a clipper bow. A <b>raked</b> funnel cap was also installed.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Scheer {{underwent}} a refit while her sister ships {{set out on}} commerce raiding operations in the Atlantic. Admiral Scheer was modified during {{the early months of}} 1940, including the installation of a new, <b>raked</b> clipper bow. The heavy command tower was replaced with a lighter structure, and she was reclassified as a heavy cruiser. Additional anti-aircraft guns were also installed, along with updated radar equipment. On 19–20 July RAF bombers attacked Admiral Scheer and the battleship , though they failed to score any hits. On 27 July, the ship was pronounced ready for service.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the 747X program, Boeing {{continued}} to study improvements that could be made to the 747. The 747-400XQLR (Quiet Long Range) was meant to have an increased range of 7,980nmi (9,200mi, 14,800km), with improvements to boost efficiency and reduce noise. Improvements studied included <b>raked</b> wingtips similar to those used on the 767-400ER and a sawtooth engine nacelle for noise reduction. Although the 747-400XQLR did not move to production, many of its features were used for the 747 Advanced, which has now been launched as the 747-8.|$|E
50|$|Side <b>Rake</b> {{along with}} back <b>rake</b> {{controls}} the chip flow and partly counteracts {{the resistance of}} the work to the movement of the cutter and can be optimized to suit the particular material being cut. Brass for example requires a back and side <b>rake</b> of 0 degrees while aluminum uses a back <b>rake</b> of 35 degrees and a side <b>rake</b> of 15 degrees.|$|R
50|$|The <b>rake</b> of a ships prow {{measures}} the angle {{at which the}} prow rises from the water (the <b>rake</b> below water being called the bow <b>rake).</b> A motorcycle or bicycle fork <b>rake</b> {{measures the}} angle at which the forks are angled down towards the ground.|$|R
50|$|A fire <b>rake</b> is a {{wildland}} fire fighting tool. A fire <b>rake</b> has a wooden or fiberglass handle with a <b>rake</b> head consisting of four very sharp, serrated, triangular steel blades. It {{is used to}} <b>rake</b> a fire break with the sharp teeth enabling it to reach fire in undergrowth in addition to loose surface debris. Another type of fire <b>rake</b> which {{looks more like a}} steel <b>rake</b> but with sharp edges on the teeth, and is sometimes referred to as a <b>rake</b> hoe is called a McLeod. The teeth of the more traditional fire <b>rake</b> which resemble the teeth of a great white shark allow it to get deeper into the undergrowth when necessary. But the preference for one over the other is somewhat subjective.|$|R
5|$|On 1 January 1800, Clarisse {{captured}} a large rice-laden merchantman, the British James. On 3 January, she detected two American 16-carronade ships forming {{a line of}} battle; although Clarisse lacked the eight guns sacrificed to escape Sybille and 60 of her men detached on her various prizes, Surcouf engaged. Clarisse <b>raked</b> the rear-most ship, the Louisa, and boarded her, while simultaneously firing a broadside on the other ship, Mercury, which attempted to rescue her mate. Nicolas Surcouf led a 30-man boarding party to seize Louisa, while Mercury escaped. Clarisse could not give chase, her bowsprit having been destroyed in the collision with Louisa. Nicolas Surcouf took a prize crew and sailed Louisa back to Port Louis.|$|E
5|$|The 24th Infantry {{consistently}} captured Battle Mountain in {{the same}} way. Artillery, mortar, and tank fire <b>raked</b> the crest and air strikes employing napalm blanketed {{the top of the}} peak. Then, the infantry attacked from the hill beneath the east slope of the summit. Supporting mortars would set up a base of fire and kept the heights under barrage until the infantry had arrived at a point just short of the crest. The mortar fire then lifted and the infantry moved rapidly up the last stretch to the top, usually to find it abandoned by the North Koreans.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Germany, she resumed training duties in the Baltic. She was withdrawn from service in May 1938 {{for a major}} modernization. The funnels were modified with <b>raked</b> caps and searchlight platforms on their sides. The ship's 8.8cm guns were replaced with more powerful 10.5cm guns. Work lasted until November 1939, shortly after the outbreak of World War II. She spent {{the next several months}} on trials and training maneuvers. On 4 January, Karlsruhe and the minelayer Schiff 23 were sent to intercept the Swedish steamer Konung Oscar, which was transporting Polish refugees from Riga to Sweden. Karlsruhe caught the Swedish vessel, declared it a prize, and sent it and the 41 Poles aboard to Memel. She was not ready for combat operations by the start of Operation Weserübung, so she was used as a troop transport for the attack on Kristiansand. The attack force also included an E-boat tender, four large torpedo boats, and several E-boats.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rake</b> {{consists}} of 12 Sleepers, 6 AC Coaches (1AC, 2AC, 3AC), 1 Pantry car, 3 General sitting and 2 SLRs. This train shares its <b>rakes</b> with the Howrah Chennai Mail Since 2008. Thus a <b>rake</b> of the Coromandal Express {{consists of}} 24 coaches with ICF <b>Rake.</b>|$|R
50|$|Barber <b>Rakes</b> {{have also}} been {{expanded}} to include a Turf <b>Rake</b> to remove stones from soil and a Road <b>Rake</b> for remove debris from roads and highways.|$|R
50|$|A zero <b>rake</b> {{angle is}} the easiest to manufacture, but has a larger crater wear when {{compared}} to positive <b>rake</b> angle as the chip slides over the <b>rake</b> face.|$|R
5|$|As {{the combat}} raged {{at the head}} of the line, the {{remainder}} of both squadrons strained to join the battle. The British eastern division under Louis reached the battling Alexandre and Spencer at 10:35, the two ships locked together to the south of the main engagement. As they passed, Canopus, Donegal and Atlas all <b>raked</b> the French ship, bringing down all of her masts and leaving her in a crippled state. Canopus then steered directly towards the battle around Impérial, as Donegal and Atlas turned northwest to intercept Brave and Jupiter respectively. At 11:00, Spencer followed Canopus while Alexandres crew were preoccupied with extinguishing a fire that had broken out on board. Alexandre was so badly damaged that she was unable to either escape or continue the action; she formally surrendered ten minutes later.|$|E
5|$|At 02:45, Amethyst {{was able}} to pull across the bows of Niémen, inflicting a devastating raking fire on the French ship which caused terrible damage. Niémen surged forward into Amethyst, but the {{collision}} caused little damage and at 03:00 Amethyst again <b>raked</b> her opponent, this time from the east. The frigates were so close that shot from Amethyst started fires among Niémens hammock netting, placed along the decks to deter boarding actions. At 03:15, Niémens mizenmast and main topmast collapsed and another fire {{broke out in the}} main top, but Amethyst was also severely damaged and at 03:30 her mainmast fell onto the deck from a combination of shot damage and stress in high winds. Niémens mainmast also collapsed a few minutes later. Both frigates had stopped firing at 03:25, as the confusion on their decks was brought under control.|$|E
5|$|Behind this combat, {{other ships}} of the centre {{division}} struck the French line, HMS Valiant under Thomas Pringle passing close to Patriote which pulled away, her crew suffering from contagion {{and unable to}} take their ship into battle. Valiant instead turned her attention on Achille, which had already been <b>raked</b> by Queen Charlotte and Brunswick, and badly damaged her before pressing on sail to join the embattled van division. HMS Orion under John Thomas Duckworth and HMS Queen under Admiral Alan Gardner both attacked the same ship, Queen suffering severely from the earlier actions in which her masts were badly damaged and her captain John Hutt mortally wounded. Both ships bore down on the French Northumberland, which was soon dismasted and left attempting to escape on only the stump of a mast. Queen was too slow to engage Northumberland as closely as Orion, and soon fell in with Jemmappes, both ships battering each other severely.|$|E
25|$|Both CR and WR competed {{to acquire}} the <b>rake,</b> with WR even announcing a time table for {{operating}} the air-conditioned <b>rake.</b> Union Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu announced that the <b>rake</b> would be transferred to CR on 16 March 2016. However, at a height of 4.335 metres the <b>rake</b> exceeds the maximum clearance height of 4.270 metres for EMU coaches on the Central Line. In particular, the <b>rake</b> cannot clear the some low height British-era bridges between CST and Kurla. Then Central Railway general manager Sunil Kumar Sood insisted that CR was conduct trials and operate the <b>rake</b> on the Harbour Line. After acquiring the <b>rake,</b> CR conducted tests, safety and mobility checks, and trial runs {{under the supervision of}} the RDSO. However, following Sood's retirement, CR abandoned plans to operate the <b>rake</b> in December 2016. CR informed the Railway Board that it could not operate the <b>rake</b> due to the clearance issue, and the Railway Board directed them to transfer the <b>rake</b> to WR. The <b>rake</b> was transferred to WR on 12 May 2017. WR General Manager Anil Kumar Gupta stated that <b>rake</b> would begin commercial operations on the Western Line after WR conducted its own tests and trial runs and receiving regulatory approvals. Although there are some clearance issues on the Western Line as well, Gupta stated that these could rectified.|$|R

5|$|During the Philippine–American War, Yorktown {{stood in}} to Baler Bay, {{on the west}} coast of Luzon, on 11 April 1899, on a mission to relieve a Spanish {{garrison}} that had been under siege by Filipino troops for nine months. Lt. James C. Gillmore and a party of sailors in the ship's whaleboat provided a decoy, ostensibly taking soundings of a nearby river. Meanwhile, Standley and an enlisted man landed farther up the coast to reconnoiter. The next day, Gillmore and his boat crew drifted into a trap, running aground too far from the river's mouth and out of sight of Yorktown. Filipino troops, hidden in the jungle-covered banks, <b>raked</b> the boat with rifle fire. Two American sailors were killed; two were mortally wounded; and the remainder, including Gillmore, were slightly wounded. The survivors were taken prisoner until freed by U.S. Army troops. Standley completed his mission and, together with the enlisted signalman, made it back to the ship.|$|E
5|$|His plan in tatters, Howe {{responded by}} example, leading his {{flagship}} HMS Queen Charlotte towards the French line which was rapidly slipping {{ahead of the}} British, steering around the meandering Caesar as he did so. Queen Charlotte first attempted {{to break through the}} French between the sixth and seventh ships from the rear, but was unable to reach this gap and instead sailed between the fifth and sixth, raking the sixth ship Eole from close range. Bellerophon and Lord Hugh Seymour in Leviathan followed close behind the flagship. Both battleships attempted to cut between the subsequent French ships; Bellerophon successfully, Leviathan prevented by damage to her helm. This manoeuvre changed the course of the battle, as Howe's ships isolated and <b>raked</b> the Terrible, Tyrannicide, and Indomptable, forcing Villaret to either abandon his ships or sacrifice the weather gage to save them.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the rebel}} {{soldiers}} {{had been told}} that they were attacking in order to save Diệm from a mutiny by the Presidential Guard. Only one or two officers in any given rebel unit knew the true situation. A high wall, a fence and a few guard posts, surrounded the palace grounds. The mutinous paratroopers disembarked from their transport vehicles and moved into position for an attack on the main gate. Some ran forward and others <b>raked</b> automatic gunfire {{at the front of the}} palace, shattering most of the windows and puncturing the walls. Diệm was nearly killed in the opening salvoes. A rebel machine gun fired into Diệm's bedroom window from the adjacent Palais de Justice and penetrated his bed, but the president had arisen just a few minutes earlier.|$|E

50|$|Later, a {{mechanically}} {{more complicated}} <b>rake</b> was developed, {{known as the}} side delivery <b>rake.</b> This usually had a gear-driven or chain-driven reel mounted roughly at a 45-degree angle to the windrow, so the hay was gathered and pushed {{to one side of}} the <b>rake</b> as it moved across the field. A side delivery <b>rake</b> could be pulled longitudinally along the windrow by horses or a tractor, eliminating the laborious and inefficient process of raising, lowering, and back-and-forth <b>raking</b> required by a dump <b>rake.</b> This allowed for the continuous spiraling windrows of a classic mid-20th-century farm hayfield. Later versions of the side delivery <b>rake</b> used a more severe transverse angle and a higher frame system, but the basic principles of operation were the same.|$|R
