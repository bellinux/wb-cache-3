5|$|Prior to the Tourist Trophy the Isle of Man had {{hosted the}} English trials for the Gordon Bennett Cup as the English {{government}} had banned motor racing on its roads.

5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into threeparts. In the first 20-minute period, cars finishing 16th or lower were eliminated.

5|$|With {{the design}} process complete, four street-ready <b>race</b> <b>cars</b> were constructed, with each vehicle {{possessing}} 65 panels and costing $250,000 to build. Two of the four cars were specialized versions. One version was the flap version, which had hydraulics and flaps to detail the close-up shots where the vehicle propelled itself through the air. The other version was the jet version, in which an actual jet engine was mounted onto the vehicle, fueled by six propane tanks. The visibility inside the vehicle was poor, so monitors were connected to cameras on the vehicle body. The professional drivers for the Tumblers practiced driving the vehicles for six months before they drove {{on the streets of}} Chicago for the film's scenes.|$|E

5|$|The {{conditions}} for the race were dry, with a capacity crowd of some 40,000 fans turning out to watch the race. The drivers took to the track on Sunday morning for a 30-minute warm-up session. Both Williams cars maintained their good performance from qualifying; Coulthard was fastest with teammate Hill in second. Schumacher completed the top three positions. Herbert and Katayama both suffered from gearbox problems with their <b>race</b> <b>cars,</b> and elected to start the race with their teams' spare cars. The Simtek team did not {{take part in the}} session, as both drivers waited for stronger suspension components flown out from the United Kingdom to be fitted to the cars for the race. Minutes before the race started, a press release from the FIA was given to all media and team personnel, notifying them that the chromatographic analysis of the Elf fuel samples taken from Schumacher's Benetton and the Coulthard's Williams during qualifying did not match the sample provided by the fuel company {{before the start of the}} season for reference purposes, thus rendering both cars illegal. Both teams were fined $30,000 and raced under appeal, as the standard penalty for the offence was disqualification from the event. Neither Schumacher nor Coulthard were informed of the situation, as the teams did not want to unsettle their drivers before the race start. Hill and Herbert's races were not affected by the judgement, despite using the same type of fuel. Samples from Ferrari's Agip and McLaren's Mobil fuel were also tested; both were in accordance with the regulations. Though 26cars qualified for the race, only 25 took the start: Martini retired on the parade lap, his Minardi car suffering a gearbox problem.|$|E
