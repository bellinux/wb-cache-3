5000|$|During the {{stalking}} {{phase of}} their attack a sniper will, if time allows, {{try to identify}} high-value targets such as senior officers or senior NCOs. They will do this by closely observing {{the behavior of the}} people in front of them. The intention is to identify who is in charge and then prepare to fire at them. It naturally follows that leaders should attempt to blend into the background by avoiding anything that distinguishes them from the most junior soldiers and attracts the interest of a sniper. In order to reduce a sniper's ability to damage the chain of command, doctrine and equipment need to prevent any observable [...] "leadership" [...] behaviors and signs. Insignia, e.g. rank insignia, should be subdued (dark/black as opposed to bright colors), camouflage colors on battledress, battledress identical for all ranks, military servants and rank-based luxuries (like saluting) avoided in forward areas, and commands and instruction should be given discreetly. Additionally, other acts such as looking at maps, using a <b>radio,</b> <b>pointing</b> authoritatively, abstaining from menial tasks and other forms of body language can betray an officer's rank. However, it is important to emphasize that if a sniper cannot identify an officer or NCO, they may then select any person that they {{have a good chance of}} hitting.|$|E

The IR and <b>radio</b> <b>point</b> source counts are based on observations by the the SCUBA and WMAP instruments respectively. We show that the contributions from IR source counts, when extrapolated from the SCUBA frequency of 350 GHz to the operating frequencies of these surveys (∼ 100 − 300 GHz), can be {{a significant source of}} additional ‘noise’ which needs to be accounted for in order to extract the optimal science from these surveys. Alternatively, these surveys give us an opportunity to study IR sources, their numbers and clustering properties, opening a new window to the high redshift universe. For the <b>radio</b> <b>point</b> sources, the contribution depends on a more uncertain extrapolation from 40 GHz but is comparable to the IR near 200 GHz.

40|$|<b>Radio</b> <b>point</b> {{sources are}} {{strongly}} correlated with clusters of galaxies, so a significant {{fraction of the}} thermal Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (SZ) effect signal could be affected by point source contamination. Based on empirical estimates of the radio galaxy population, it is shown that the rms temperature fluctuations of the thermal SZ effect could be underestimated {{by as much as}} 30 % at an observing frequency of 30 GHz at ℓ � 1000. The effect is larger at higher multipoles. If the recent report of excess power at small angular scales is to be explained by the thermal SZ effect, then <b>radio</b> <b>point</b> sources at an observing frequency of 30 GHz must be a surprisingly weak contaminant of the SZ effect for low-mass clusters. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new cross-correlation method to detect and verify the astrophysical origin of Faraday Rotation (FR) in multiwavelength surveys. FR is well studied in radio astronomy from <b>radio</b> <b>point</b> sources but the λ^ 2 suppression of FR makes detecting and accounting for this effect difficult at millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths. Therefore statistical methods are used to attempt to detect FR in {{the cosmic microwave background}} (CMB). Most estimators of the FR power spectrum rely on single frequency data. In contrast, we investigate the correlation of polarized CMB maps with FR measure maps from <b>radio</b> <b>point</b> sources. We show a factor of ∼ 30 increase in sensitivity over single frequency estimators and predict detections exceeding 10 σ significance for a CMB-S 4 like experiment. Improvements in observations of FR from current and future radio polarization surveys will greatly increase the usefulness of this method.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{possible}} impact of galactic and extragalactic foregrounds on {{measurements of the}} cosmic microwave background (CMB). We find that, given our present understanding of the foregrounds, they are unlikely to qualitatively affect the ability of the MAP and Planck satellites to determine the angular power spectrum of the CMB, the key statistic for constraining cosmological parameters. Sufficiently far from the galactic plane, the only foregrounds that will affect power spectrum determination with any significance are the extragalactic ones. For MAP we find the most troublesome foregrounds are <b>radio</b> <b>point</b> sources and the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect. For Planck they are these same <b>radio</b> <b>point</b> sources and the Far Infrared Background. Prior knowledge of the statistics of the SZ component (either via theoretical calculation, or higher frequency observations of just a few percent of the sky, such as will be done by balloon-borne experiments) may significantly improve MAP’s determination of the CMB power spectrum. We also explore the foreground impact on MAP and Planck polarization power spectrum measurements. Subject headings: Cosmology, Cosmic Microwave Background 1...|$|R
30|$|In the {{metropolitan}} area scenario we study an interference coordination scheme based on soft frequency reuse. It assigns power masks (in the frequency domain) to neighboring <b>radio</b> access <b>points</b> to coordinate the mutual interference. Thereby, soft frequency reuse enables frequency reuse one {{and at the same}} time each <b>radio</b> access <b>point</b> has high power resources with reduced interference available to schedule MS located at the border area. Soft frequency reuse is better suited for {{the metropolitan}} area than beamforming because the radio signal propagates very well in the street canyons making it difficult to separate different beams. Further, interference coordination is mainly needed at street crossings and in the border area between <b>radio</b> access <b>points,</b> whereas the border area is smaller than in a wide area deployment.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of diffuse Galactic, far-infrared extragalactic source, and <b>radio</b> <b>point</b> source {{emission}} on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data anticipated from the MAP experiment. We focus on the correlation function and genus statistics measured from mock MAP foreground-contaminated CMB anisotropy maps generated in a spatially-flat cosmological constant dominated cosmological model. Analyses of the simulated MAP data at 90 GHz (0. ◦ 3 FWHM resolution smoothed) show that foreground effects on the correlation function are small compared with cosmic variance. However, the Galactic emission, even just from the region with |b |> 20 ◦, significantly affects the topology of CMB anisotropy, causing a negative genus shift non-Gaussianity signal. Given the expected level of cosmic variance, this effect can be effectively reduced by subtracting existing Galactic foreground emission models from the observed data. IRAS and DIRBE far-infrared extragalactic sources have little effect on the CMB anisotropy. <b>Radio</b> <b>point</b> sources raise the amplitude of the correlation function considerably on scales below 0. ◦ 5, and also result in an asymmetry of the genus curve (at 2 σ) on 0. ◦ 5 scales. While the removal of bright sources above 5 σ detection limit effectively reduces the excess correlation, the genus asymmetry remains significant. Accurate <b>radio</b> <b>point</b> source data is essential for an unambiguous detection of CMB anisotropy non-Gaussianity on these scales. When all the foreground sources are subtracted from the observed CMB anisotropy map, non-Gaussianity of cosmological origin can be detected at the 2 σ level if the measured genus shift parameter |∆ν | � 0. 02 (0. 04) or if the measured genus asymmetry parameter |∆g | � 0. 03 (0. 08) on a 0. ◦ 3 (1. ◦ 0) FWHM scale...|$|R

30|$|The highest {{gain from}} {{cooperative}} relaying is obtained if the signals {{received from the}} cooperating <b>radio</b> access <b>points</b> are of similar strength. Therefore we base the decision which <b>radio</b> access <b>points</b> (BS or RS) should form the VAA on the received signal strength reported by the MS and RS. In particular we propose {{the use of a}} static version of the REACT algorithm [48]. The original algorithm was developed for mobile ad hoc networks with relays and {{due to the fact that}} in the scenario under investigation the RSs are located at fixed positions there is no need to perform periodic neighbor discovery and topology recognition. The static version of REACT is executed by the BS and exploits information about power levels of the signals received by MSs from different <b>radio</b> access <b>points</b> (BS or RS) as well as the power levels of the signals received by RSs from the BS. Thus, the BS has a good overview of the topology to select the cooperation type.|$|R
40|$|We use {{multi-frequency}} {{information in}} first year WMAP data {{to search for}} the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect. WMAP has sufficiently broad frequency coverage to constrain SZ without the addition of higher frequency data: the SZ power spectrum amplitude is expected to increase 50 % from W to Q frequency band. This, in combination with the low noise in WMAP, allows us to strongly constrain the SZ contribution. We derive an optimal frequency combination of WMAP cross-spectra to extract SZ in the presence of noise, CMB, and <b>radio</b> <b>point</b> sources, which are marginalized over. We find that the SZ contribution is less than 2 % (95 % c. l.) at the first acoustic peak in W band. Under the assumption that the removed <b>radio</b> <b>point</b> sources are not correlated with SZ this limit implies sigma_ 8 < 1. 07 at 95 % c. l. We investigate the effect on the cosmological parameters of allowing an SZ component. We run Monte Carlo Markov Chains with and without an SZ component and find that the addition of SZ does not affect any of the cosmological conclusions. We conclude that SZ does not contaminate the WMAP CMB or change cosmological parameters, refuting the recent claims that they may be corrupted. Comment: 10 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables.
