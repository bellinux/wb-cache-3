The sobs of the household made the English party feel very glad when it was over and the cavalcade was in motion. A cavalcade it was, for each gentleman rode and so did his body-servant, and each horse had a mounted groom. The two young officers had besides each two chargers, requiring a groom and horse boy, and each conducted half a dozen fresh troopers to join the army. A coach was the <b>regulation</b> <b>mode</b> of travelling for ladies, but both the English girls had remonstrated so strongly that Madame de Bellaise had consented to their riding, though she took them and Suzanne the first day's journey well beyond the ken of the Parisians in her own carriage, as far as Senlis, where there was a fresh parting with the two lads, fewer tears, and more counsel and encouragement, with many fond messages to her son, many to her sister in England, and with affectionate words to her niece a whisper to her to remember that she would not be in a Protestant country till she reached Holland or England.|$|E

He had small twinkling eyes, and a pock-marked face; wore a fur cap, a dark corduroy jacket, greasy fustian trousers, and an apron. His wardrobe was, in truth, rather out of repair; but he excused himself to the company by stating that his 'time' was only out an hour before; and that, in consequence of having worn the regimentals for six weeks past, he {{had not been able to}} bestow any attention on his private clothes. Mr. Chitling added, with strong marks of irritation, that the new way of fumigating clothes up yonder was infernal unconstitutional, for it burnt holes in them, and there was no remedy against the County. The same remark he considered to apply to the <b>regulation</b> <b>mode</b> of cutting the hair: which he held to be decidedly unlawful. Mr. Chitling wound up his observations by stating that he had not touched a drop of anything for forty-two moral long hard-working days; and that he 'wished he might be busted if he warn't as dry as a lime-basket.' ...|$|E

It {{is the nature of}} its centrality which changes but not the centrality itself, which remains a constant {{of the majority of the}} economies of developed capitalism. The actual centrality of the labor relations is based on competencies.

40|$|International audienceAcademic {{debate on}} public utility {{regulation}} has considerably {{evolved over the}} past 50 years. The conflict between the supporters of franchise regulation and commission regulation {{has given way to}} much more balanced in-depth analyses. Regulation is defined {{on the basis of its}} structure but also its scope and regulation incentives. A <b>regulation</b> <b>mode</b> must above all be evaluated with regard to the institutional environment. We propose a neo-institutionally-inspired analysis framework and show how the dynamic relationship between regulation and the institutional environment can lead to reforms and ultimately to more efficient regulation. The findings of a French water utility sector analysis underline how a series of national normative reforms and local exploratory reforms can give rise to innovations in the <b>regulation</b> <b>mode.</b> This new hybrid regulation, between commission regulation and franchise bidding, could be more effective than previous <b>regulation</b> <b>mode,</b> i. e. more stable and in line with stakeholders' expectations...|$|E

40|$|The {{financial}} form {{of capital}} organisation, the economic structure of production activities, the employment relationship are strongly linked, even interdependent. One {{of these terms}} might as well dominate the other ones. Any <b>Regulation</b> <b>mode</b> may be characterised with a particular combination of this three components. In the 80 ánd 90,́ {{the relations between the}} financial, the economic, and the social p̈olesc̈hange deeply: the financial pole becomes autonomous, spreads, and dominates the other poles. This movement does not come out of the financial sphere itself. It is more the result of growing contradictions between economics and social. In the 50 ánd 60,́ economics and social had been efficiently associated or combined. This found place in a <b>Regulation</b> <b>mode</b> whose institutional forms worked within a coherent national frame. In the globalisation, economics and social are nowadays dissociated and conflicting, as it might be seen looking the way wages or social welfare are considered in the competitiveness debate. In this paper, we first suggest some empirical remarks about transformations which go together in France and Germany with the crisis of fordism and its difficult mutation towards a new <b>Regulation</b> <b>mode</b> (1.). Second, we propose some theoretical lines in order to qualify the growth regime (2.). At the end, a final part analyses the ambivalent evolutions of the employment relationship, between obedience to a logic binding together mobility and income, and necessary foundation of a possible new knowledge-based capitalism [...] <b>Regulation</b> <b>mode,</b> growth regime, employment relationship, fordism, knowledge-based capitalism. ...|$|E

In such a case, the PV generation working on MPPT is supposed to switch to bus <b>regulation</b> <b>mode</b> in order to curtail the generation. A mode change logic is provided in MG 1 and is demonstrated in Fig.  12.

40|$|Water {{distribution}} networks face {{several problems}} related to leakages, where the pressure control strategy is a common practice for water loss management. Small-scale hydropower schemes, where pumps as turbines replace pressure reducing valves, can be considered an interesting technical solution, which ensures both economic convenience and system flexibility. Due to the water networks’ variable operating conditions, a new methodology to model the effectiveness of pumps as turbines was developed based on the efficiency and the mechanical reliability of the hydropower device and {{the flexibility of the}} plant. System effectiveness is proposed as the objective function in the optimization procedure and applied to a real system, enabling one to emphasize that the hydraulic <b>regulation</b> <b>mode</b> of the plant is better than the electric <b>regulation</b> <b>mode</b> for American Petroleum Industry (API) manufacturing standards of pumps...|$|E
