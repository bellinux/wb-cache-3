5|$|Stropharia caerulea, {{commonly}} known as the blue <b>roundhead,</b> is an inedible species of agaric fungus in the family Strophariaceae. It is a common species found in Europe and North America, where it grows as a saprophyte in meadows, roadsides, hedgerows, gardens, and woodchip mulch. S.caerulea was officially described to science in 1979, although it was known to be a distinct species for about two centuries before that. The taxon Stropharia cyanea, as defined by Risto Tuomikoski in 1953, and used by several later authors, is a synonym of S.caerulea.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his difficult relationship with Price, Reeves {{had to deal with}} a few production problems during the shooting. On the first day, Price was thrown from his horse and sent back to his hotel to recover. The actor returned to work the following day. Towards the end of filming, a strike was called when the British technicians union learned the production company was not hiring a large enough crew as required by union rules. After an extra man was hired, the crew resumed working. On two occasions, Reeves was short of actors. Waddilove replaced an absent actor as a <b>Roundhead</b> officer during Wymark's one-day scene. Waddilove's wife, Susi, played one {{of the women in the}} animal enclosure during the witch-burning sequence.|$|E

5|$|Watchet {{developed}} as a town thanks to its closeness to the minerals within the Brendon Hills, and its access to the River Severn for onward shipping. Aside from local ships plying trade across the river, from 1564 onwards the port was used for import of salt and wine from France. In 1643 during the English Civil War, a Royalist ship was sent to Watchet to reinforce for the siege of Dunster Castle. Parliamentarian (<b>Roundhead)</b> Captain Popham ordered his troops into the sea with the tide on the ebb, and with the ship unable to move, attacked the ship with fire from their carbines. Taken by surprise and under heavy attack, the Royalist commander surrendered the ship, resulting in a ship technically at sea being captured by troops on horseback.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the abbey}} are 617 wall {{memorials}} and 847 floor stones. They include those dedicated to Beau Nash, Admiral Arthur Phillip (first Governor {{of the colony}} of New South Wales, which became part of Australia after federation in 1901), James Montague (Bishop of Bath and Wells), Lady Waller (wife of William Waller, a <b>Roundhead</b> military leader in the English Civil War), Elizabeth Grieve (wife of James Grieve, physician to Elizabeth, Empress of Russia), Sir William Baker, John Sibthorp, Richard Hussey Bickerton, William Hoare, Richard Bickerton and US Senator William Bingham. Many of the monuments in the churchyard were carved between 1770 and 1860 by Reeves of Bath. War memorials include those commemorating the First Anglo-Afghan War (1841–42), the First World War (1914–18), and the Second World War (1939–45). The most recent memorial was installed in 1958 to commemorate Isaac Pitman, the developer of Pitman shorthand, who died in 1897.|$|E
25|$|The Storming of Bristol {{took place}} on 26 July 1643, during the First English Civil War. The Cavalier (Royalist) army under Prince Rupert of the Rhine, King Charles's nephew and {{lieutenant}} general, captured the important city and port of Bristol from its weakened <b>Roundhead</b> (Parliamentarian) garrison. The city remained under Royalist control until {{near the end of}} the war.|$|E

Nearby St Albans in Hertfordshire was the headquarters of the <b>Roundheads,</b> and troops were occasionally stationed at Dunstable. The town was plundered by King Charles I's soldiers when passing through in June 1644, and Essex's men destroyed the Eleanor cross.|$|R
50|$|The {{siege of}} High Ercall Hall in High Ercall, Shropshire, England {{took place during}} the English Civil War. There were a total of three sieges, In each the Hall was held by Royalists (Cavaliers) and besieged by Parliamentarians (<b>Roundheads).</b> The final and longest siege took place from July 1645 to March 1646, when the Cavalier {{commander}} surrendered the hall to the <b>Roundheads.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1644 a {{force of}} some 2,000 <b>Roundhead</b> cavalry, under Sir William Waller, {{surprised}} Royalist troops who were billeted {{in and around the}} town. 100 horse and 400 foot soldiers were captured without resistance. Waller's men stabled their horses in the Great Choir of the Priory church and apparent evidence of their presence {{can be seen in the}} pews which show signs of having been chewed.|$|E
25|$|The changed {{political}} situation had already allowed Thomas's son Nathan Paget {{to return to}} England, where he {{was admitted to the}} College of Physicians in 1640. With the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, his career blossomed at Cambridge, inside the area controlled by Parliament. He signed the Solemn League and Covenant, as Parliament demanded in order to cement its alliance with the Scottish Covenanters. He also married Elizabeth Cromwell, the cousin of a minor <b>Roundhead</b> commander called Oliver Cromwell.|$|E
25|$|Cavalier was not {{understood}} {{at the time}} as primarily a term describing a style of dress, but a whole political and social attitude. However, in modern times the word has become more particularly associated with the court fashions of the period, which included long flowing hair in ringlets, brightly coloured clothing with elaborate trimmings and lace collars and cuffs, and plumed hats. This contrasted with the dress of at least the most extreme <b>Roundhead</b> supporters of Parliament, with their preference for shorter hair and plainer dress, although neither side conformed to the stereotypical images entirely.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{engagement}} was {{small compared to}} Napoleonic naval battles such as the Battle of Trafalgar, the victory had disproportionate strategic importance, opening Canada up to possible invasion, while simultaneously protecting the entire Ohio Valley. The loss of the British squadron directly led to the critical Battle of the Thames, the rout of British forces by Harrison's army, the deaths of Tecumseh and <b>Roundhead,</b> and the breakup of his Indian alliance. Along with the Battle of Plattsburgh, {{it was one of}} only two significant fleet victories of the war.|$|E
25|$|Blasko spent April 2006 {{recording}} {{her second}} album, What the Sea Wants, the Sea Will Have, in Auckland, New Zealand at <b>Roundhead</b> Studio, {{which is owned}} by Crowded House front man, Neil Finn. She co-produced the album with Cranny and Jim Moginie (ex-Midnight Oil); which featured musical contributions from Dave Symes, de Araujo, Moginie and Cranny, and was mixed by Victor Van Vugt. All the tracks were co-written by Blasko with Cranny. The album was released in Australia on 21 October, which debuted at No.7 on the ARIA Albums Charts, and in 2008 it received platinum accreditation.|$|E
25|$|The royal {{connection}} to Northampton Castle became less significant, {{and by the}} time of the English Civil War, Northampton was decidedly pro-Parliament. Though Spencer Compton, Earl of Northampton, was a royalist (Cavalier) and backed King Charles I, the people of Northampton supported Parliament and Oliver Cromwell's republican <b>Roundhead</b> army. The town had a long history of religious dissent from the Lollards and Puritanism gained a strong hold on the town. The corporation of the town, having already refused to provide troops to the King in 1632 or to pay the notorious ship money tax in 1636, petitioned Parliament in 1642 against papists and bishops.|$|E
6000|$|With exulting shouts the <b>Roundheads</b> {{poured over}} the wall. The garrison, headed by Harry {{and the other}} officers, strove hard to drive them back, but it was useless. Cromwell and Ireton were in the van of their troops, and these, {{accustomed}} to victory, hewed {{their way through the}} ranks of the besieged. Many of them lost heart, and, throwing down their arms, cried for quarter. With shouts of [...] "No quarter!" [...] "Hew down the Amalakites!" [...] "Strike, and spare not!" [...] the <b>Roundheads</b> cut down their now defenseless foes. Maddened at the sight, the besieged made another desperate effort at resistance, and for awhile fought so stoutly that the <b>Roundheads</b> could gain no ground of them.|$|R

25|$|As {{the player}} explores, it becomes {{apparent}} {{the area is}} haunted by {{the spirits of the}} people who vanished in 1947, amongst others (including a <b>Roundhead</b> soldier who died in the original inn during the English Civil War, Timothy, Polly, Nigel and Pete). The player learns George Crabtree, the owner of the hotel in 1947, was suspected of murdering the others and then fleeing. However, Crabtree had learned of an evil in the hotel and was planning to imprison it by using twelve symbols to recite an incantation. Each symbol was on a piece of vellum, which he distributed amongst the staff and guests, most of whom thought he was mad.|$|E
25|$|Birmingham, {{continued}} to manufacture weapons {{of all kinds}} during this period and was heavily relied upon by Parliamentary armies for such wares. It remained on the borders between the largely Cavalier garrisoned Worcestershire and <b>Roundhead</b> garrisoned Warwickshire. Colonel Tinker Fox operated from Edgbaston House close to Birmingham and probably {{took place in the}} attack on Aston Hall on 28 December 1643, removing the main royalist base in the Birmingham. He and his garrison actively raided into Worcestershire during the First Civil War. Perhaps his most famous exploit was a commando style raid on Bewdley which resulted in the capture of Sir Thomas Lyttelton its governor.|$|E
25|$|Cnut died at Shaftesbury in Dorset and {{was buried}} in the Old Minster, Winchester. With the events of 1066 the new regime of Normandy was keen to signal its arrival with an ambitious {{programme}} of grandiose cathedrals and castles throughout the High Middle Ages. Winchester Cathedral was built on the old Anglo-Saxon site and the previous burials, including Cnut's, were set in mortuary chests there. During the English Civil War in the 17th century, plundering <b>Roundhead</b> soldiers scattered the bones of Cnut on the floor and they were spread amongst the various other chests, notably those of William Rufus. After the restoration of the monarchy, the bones were collected and replaced in their chests, although somewhat out of sorts.|$|E

25|$|Anthony Coplestone (died 1648) {{inherited}} Upton Pyne on {{his marriage}} to the heiress Margaret Larder. He was a son of Anthony Coplestone of Weeke (or Wike), Devon, by his wife Mary Parker, a daughter of John Parker of North Molton, an ancestor of the Parker Earls of Morley of Saltram House. He was descended from the Coplestones of Instow, a junior branch of the Coplestones of Coplestone in Devon, an ancient Devon family. Although Anthony Coplestone had a son, in 1640 he sold Upton Pyne to his son-in-law Sir John Coplestone (d.1650-1) of Nash in Dorset, knighted by Oliver Cromwell, the husband of his 6th daughter Grace Coplestone and father of the <b>Roundhead</b> commander John Copleston.|$|E
25|$|It is 1660, {{just before}} the Restoration of the Monarchy. Sir George Vernon, a Royalist, is in a {{property}} dispute with his cousin, Rupert Vernon, a <b>Roundhead</b> (i.e., a supporter of Parliament). Sir George fears that this dispute will be resolved in favour of his cousin, who has strong ties to the current government, and that his family would lose Haddon Hall. To secure the estate's long-term future, Sir George has arranged a marriage between Rupert and his only surviving child, Dorothy Vernon. But Dorothy {{is in love with}} John Manners, the impoverished second son of the Earl of Rutland. Manners, who is also a Royalist, is of no use to Sir George, and he has forbidden their union.|$|E
25|$|During the English Civil War, Melton was a <b>Roundhead</b> {{garrison}} {{commanded by}} a Colonel Rossiter. Two battles were {{fought in the}} town: in November 1643, Royalists caught the garrison unaware and carried away prisoners and booty; in February 1645, Sir Marmaduke Langdale, commanding a Royalist force of 1,500 men, inflicted severe losses on the Roundheads. Around 300 men {{were said to have}} been killed. According to legend a hillside where the battle was thought to have been fought was ankle deep in blood, hence the name 'Ankle Hill'. However, this name is mentioned in documents pre-dating the Civil War. Furthermore, in the past, the names of Dalby Road and Ankle Hill have been switched around, thus confusing the true site of the battle.|$|E
