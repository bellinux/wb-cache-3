The case against Enaam Arnaout involves allegations that Arnaout lied about his past as a fundraiser for Osama Bin Laden and other mujahideen fighting in Afghanistan when he applied to become a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1993.

Information retrieval systems (e. g., PubMed) typically <b>return</b> a list <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> {{in response to}} a user’s query.

The authors address physicians’ information needs and described the design, implementation, and evaluation of the medical question answering system (MedQA). Although our long term goal is to enable MedQA to answer all types of medical questions, currently, we currently implement MedQA to integrate information retrieval, extraction, and summarization techniques to automatically generate paragraph-level text for definitional questions (i. e., “What is X?”).

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a system for}} web-based information retrieval that supports precise and informative post-query organization (automated document clustering by topic) to decrease real search time {{on the part of}} the user. Most existing Information Retrieval systems depend on the user to perform intelligent, specific queries with Boolean operators in order to minimize the set <b>of</b> <b>returned</b> <b>documents.</b> The user essentially must guess the appropriate keywords before performing the query. Other systems use a vector space model which is more suitable to performing the document similarity operations which permit hierarchical clustering <b>of</b> <b>returned</b> <b>documents</b> by topic. This allows "post query " refinement by the user. The system we propose is a hybrid beween these two systems, compatibile with the former, while providing the enhanced document organization permissable by the latter. - 1...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Provision {{of answers}} to informally phrased {{questions}} {{is a central}} part of information retrieval. These answers traditionally take the form <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> retrieved from a text database, but documents will often be unsatisfactory as answers. They may be large and unwieldy; the answer they represent may be diffuse, and therefore hard for the user to extract; and word-based retrieval systems may be misled by the breadth of vocabulary <b>of</b> a long <b>document</b> into believing it to be relevant. Indexing and <b>returning</b> parts <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> addresses these problems. We have approached the problem <b>of</b> partial <b>documents</b> in two ways. The first approach is to regard documents as an unstructured series of "pages" of text of similar length, each of which can be returned as an answer to a query. We would expect, under this approach, that any bias in the retrieval mechanism towards <b>documents</b> <b>of</b> a particular length should be eliminated.
