50|$|According to the Internal Revenue Service, 77% of {{tax returns}} filed in 2004 {{received}} a <b>refund</b> check, {{with the average}} <b>refund</b> check being $2,100. In 2011, the average tax <b>refund</b> was $2,913. Taxpayers may choose to have their <b>refund</b> directly deposited into their bank account, have a check mailed to them, or have their <b>refund</b> applied to the following year's income tax. As of 2006, tax filers may now split their tax <b>refund</b> with direct deposit in up to three separate accounts with three different financial institutions. This has given taxpayers an opportunity to save and spend some of their <b>refund</b> (rather than only spend their <b>refund).</b> Every year, a number of U.S. taxpayers around the country get tax <b>refunds</b> even if they owe zero income tax. This is due to withholding calculations and {{the earned income tax}} credit. Because withholding is calculated on an annualized basis, an individual just entering the work force or unemployed {{for a long period of}} time will have more tax than is owed withheld. <b>Refund</b> anticipation loans are a common means to receive a tax <b>refund</b> early, but at the expense of high fees that can reach over 200% annual interest. In the 1990s, <b>refunds</b> could take as long as twelve weeks to come back to the taxpayer; however, the average time for a <b>refund</b> is now six weeks, with <b>refunds</b> from electronically filed returns coming in three weeks.|$|R

5|$|After Prussia {{expressed}} an interest in the ship, the Emperor of France, Napoleon III, bought her in April for 2.5 million dollars over the objections of his own navy, which preferred a home-built ship.

On 27 June, Webb <b>refunded</b> the money that had been paid to him and also purchased those items furnished by the government. A little over a week later, he attempted to sail to France, but had to return to port the following day due to engine problems. These were not resolved until 19 July when he, and his entire family, set sail. Dunderberg arrived at Cherbourg on 3 August and the French Navy took possession three days later.|$|E

Mosche and the rabbi of Temple Israel were to split the offices of rabbi and cantor: Baith Israel, at the time, had no rabbi.

50|$|<b>Refund</b> {{anticipation}} loan (RAL) is {{a short-term}} consumer loan in the United States {{provided by a}} third party against an expected tax <b>refund</b> for the duration it takes the tax authority to pay the <b>refund.</b> The loan term was usually about two to three weeks, related to {{the time it took}} the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to deposit <b>refunds</b> in electronic accounts. The loans were designed to make the <b>refund</b> available in as little as 24 hours.

40|$|Although {{previous}} research demonstrates {{the profitability of}} partial <b>refund</b> policies in a monopoly setting, {{there is a certain}} lack of ubiquity in practice about these <b>refunds</b> in competitive service markets. This raises the question of how a partial <b>refund</b> policy may work and whether it is even sustainable in a competitive environment. This study investigates how competition may influence the profitability and the equilibrium choice of <b>refund</b> policies. It is shown that partial <b>refunds</b> may endogenously change the nature of strategic interaction between service providers from local monopolies into a competition regime, which moderates the gains from exploiting the efficiency-enhancing effect of partial <b>refunds.</b> A whole range of pure-strategy equilibria can be obtained {{as a result of the}} interplay between the efficiency-improving and the competition-intensifying effects. When the capacity is small (large) such that the efficiency-improving (the competition-intensifying) effect is dominant, both firms in equilibrium follow identical partial (zero) <b>refund</b> policies. Moreover, interestingly, the symmetric firms may end up in an asymmetric equilibrium in which one firm follows a partial <b>refund</b> policy and the other adopts a zero <b>refund</b> policy. advance selling, cancellations, capacity constraint, competition, contingent contracts, <b>refunds,</b> reservations, services, uncertainty, yield management...|$|R
5|$|In October 1867, {{an agent}} for Swift & Co. {{negotiated}} a deal with Peru to purchase Catawba and her sister for a million dollars apiece. Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy, initially indicated that the company could repurchase the pair if it <b>refunded</b> the government's costs to build them, but {{changed his mind and}} said that he had no authority to do that. Congress debated the issue and ultimately decided that they would be appraised by a board of officers and that the highest competitive bid in equal to or in excess of the appraised value would be accepted. The ship was appraised at $375,000 and sold for that amount, possibly after a rigged bid, on 11 April 1868.|$|E

Although Square solicited pre-orders for the game, Kaoru Moriyama, a former Square employee, affirms that management canceled the ambitious project before it advanced beyond the early planning stages.

A total of $32 million had been raised. Several years later, the possibility of a fifth season was still being discussed with Braga suggesting that fans could prompt Netflix into producing a new season of Enterprise by watching the existing four seasons on the service.
