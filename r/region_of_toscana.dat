This naming of the north-central area of the Italian peninsula stems from the historically high levels of support that the Italian Communist Party (PCI) enjoyed {{for much of the}} post-World War two period. Notwithstanding the dissolution of the PCI, and the subsequent reconfigurations of the Italian left that took place throughout the 1990 s, voters within la zona rossa still exhibit leftist tendencies.

40|$|The National Prevention Plan (NPP) 2010 - 2012, {{approved}} by the Agreement between the Government, the Regions and Autonomous Provinces of Trento and Bolzano on 29 April 2010, called for Regions to adopt, by 31 / 12 / 2010, the Regional Prevention Plan (RPP) for implementing the interventions provided by the NPP 2010 - 2012. This article has considered and compared the different RPP’s. In an attempt to provide an outlook on the future medical prevention plans {{over the next few}} years in Italy, a comparison has been made between the RPP from 19 Regions and the Autonomous Province of Trento. This work has been focused on the actions identified in regional plans as a priority concerning the major common and innovative elements. The analysis of each RPP revealed a common plan to chronic degenerative diseases, because of the aging of the population in every <b>Region</b> <b>of</b> Italy. Other important common targets are: surveillance systems, vaccination programs and screening programs. Toscana and Liguria, more than other Regions, are engaged in the creation of networks involving various social actors. In some Regions there are projects aimed at eliminating social, economic or gender inequities, such as the project “women’s health” in the <b>Region</b> <b>of</b> Puglia. <b>Toscana</b> and Emilia-Romagna Plans pay attention to environment and pollution issues.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to reflect on some features <b>of</b> David <b>Toscana’s</b> novel "Los puentes de Königsberg". In this contribution by the Northern Mexican writer there are unusual parallelisms between different realities of the cities of Monterrey (Mexico) and Königsberg (East Prussia), which become the basis of the structure of the novel. In this framework the author situates certain eccentric characters, providing them with a “double life”, a real Mexican one and an imaginary East-Prussian one, in order to contrast the cities and validate the superiority of Königsberg, the actual protagonist <b>of</b> the novel. <b>Toscana</b> uses selected criteria, such as scientific and cultural contributions by the cities, their different historical fates, and the moral attitudes of their inhabitants towards discrimination, war crimes and gender violence, which implies a severe critique of Monterrey’s society. The set of parallelisms between the cities is totally convincing as a fictional structure and emphasizes the most prominent quality <b>of</b> <b>Toscana’s</b> analysed prose...|$|R

50|$|Würzburg's {{increasing}} secularisation as a bishopric and its eventual {{surrender to}} Bavarian rule {{at the beginning}} of the 19th century resulted in the loss of the university's Roman Catholic character. The end of the city's status as a Grand Duchy under Ferdinand <b>of</b> <b>Toscana</b> in 1814 heralded the Alma Julia's ideological transition to the non-denominational establishment which endures to this day. This new inclusiveness towards professors and students alike was instrumental in the resultant upturn in all areas of research and education in the 19th century. Since then, the university has borne the name of its second and most influential founder, officially known as the Julius-Maximilians-Universität of Bavaria.|$|R

40|$|Toscana {{virus is}} an {{emerging}} sandfly-borne bunyavirus in Mediterranean Europe responsible for neurological diseases in humans. It {{accounts for about}} 80 % of paediatric meningitis cases during the summer. Despite the important impact <b>of</b> <b>Toscana</b> virus infection-associated disease on human health, currently approved vaccines or effective antiviral treatments are not available. In this research, we have analyzed the effect of bovine lactoferrin, a bi-globular iron-binding glycoprotein with potent antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities, on Toscana virus infection in vitro. Our results showed that lactoferrin was capable <b>of</b> inhibiting <b>Toscana</b> virus replication in a dose-dependent manner. Results obtained when lactoferrin {{was added to the}} cells during different phases of viral infection showed that lactoferrin was able to prevent viral replication when added during the viral adsorption step or during the entire cycle of virus infection, demonstrating that its action takes place in an early phase of viral infection. In particular, our results demonstrated that the anti-Toscana virus action of lactoferrin took place on virus attachment to the cell membrane, mainly through a competition for common glycosaminoglycan receptors. These findings provide further insights on the antiviral activity of bovine lactoferrin...|$|R
