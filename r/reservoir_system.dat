5|$|The {{most likely}} cause of {{collapse}} at Tikal is overpopulation and agrarian failure. The fall of Tikal was {{a blow to}} the heart of Classic Maya civilization, the city having {{been at the forefront of}} courtly life, art and architecture for over a thousand years, with an ancient ruling dynasty. However, new research regarding paleoenvironmental proxies from the Tikal <b>reservoir</b> <b>system</b> suggests that a meteorological drought may have led to the abandonment of Tikal.|$|E
25|$|In a bid {{to solve}} the {{salinity}} problem, local residents proposed constructing a tidal barrage across the mouth of Suisun Bay, a project which was never realized. In 1919 a different solution {{came in the form}} of the Marshall Plan, created by Robert Marshall of the United States Geological Survey. It proposed a large dam across the Sacramento River just downstream of its confluence with the Pit River near the copper mining town of Kennett, several hundred miles to the north of the Delta. The dam would store water for release during the dry months when the Delta was most vulnerable to saltwater intrusion, with the added benefit of controlling floods in the winter. Water captured by the dam would increase the irrigation supply, for both the Sacramento Valley and the San Joaquin Valley further south, with which it would be linked by an extensive aqueduct and <b>reservoir</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

Various estimates place the time it would take for Powell to completely fill with silt at 300 to 700 years.

500|$|Paris in {{its early}} history had only the Seine and Bièvre rivers for water. From 1809, the Canal de l'Ourcq {{provided}} Paris with water from less-polluted rivers to the north-east of the capital. From 1857, the civil engineer Eugène Belgrand, under Napoleon III, oversaw {{the construction of a}} series of new aqueducts that brought water from locations all around the city to several reservoirs built atop the Capital's highest points of elevation. From then on, the new <b>reservoir</b> <b>system</b> became Paris's principal source of drinking water, and the remains of the old system, pumped into lower levels of the same reservoirs, were from then on used for the cleaning of Paris's streets.

500|$|Norfolk's {{water quality}} has been {{recognized}} one of the cleanest water systems in the United States and ranked as the fourth best in the United States by Men's Health. The city of Norfolk has a tremendous capacity for clean fresh water. The city owns nine reservoirs: Lake Whitehurst, Little Creek Reservoir, Lake Lawson, Lake Smith, Lake Wright, Lake Burnt Mills, Western Branch Reservoir, Lake Prince and Lake Taylor. The Virginia tidewater area has grown faster than the local freshwater supply. The river water has always been salty, and the fresh groundwater is no longer available in most areas. Currently, water for the cities of Chesapeake and Virginia Beach is pumped from Lake Gaston (which straddles the Virginia-North Carolina border) into the City of Norfolk's <b>reservoir</b> <b>system</b> and then diverted to the City of Chesapeake for treatment by the City of Chesapeake.

40|$|Operation of <b>reservoir</b> <b>systems</b> {{to comply}} with water quality {{criteria}} is becoming an important management goal. A methodology is developed for optimal short term operation of <b>reservoir</b> <b>systems</b> to control the downstream water quality, using Genetic Algorithm based linked simulation optimization.

The cumulative distribution funcions of inflows are incorporated as an approximated distribution function in the optimization model and are used to define chance constraints with associated reliabilities.

40|$|Pulsatile drug {{delivery}} aims to release drugs in a planned pattern i. e. at appropriate time and/or at a suitable site of action. Pharmaceutical invention and research are increasingly focusing on delivery systems which enhance desirable therapeutic objectives while minimising side effects. However, in recent pharmaceutical applications involving pulsatile delivery, multiparticulate dosage forms are gaining much favour over single-unit dosage forms {{because of their}} potential benefits like predictable gastric emptying, no risk of dose dumping, flexible release patterns and increased bioavailability with less inter- and intra-subject variability. Based on these, the present review aims to study multiparticulate pulsatile delivery systems, for which the <b>Reservoir</b> <b>systems</b> with rupturable polymeric coatings and <b>Reservoir</b> <b>systems</b> with erodible polymer coatings are primarily involved in the control of release. Multiparticulate {{drug delivery}} systems provide tremendous opportunities for designing new controlled and delayed release oral formulations, thus extending the frontier of future pharmaceutical development.

40|$|Variety of {{optimization}} {{techniques have}} been applied to solve various operational settings of <b>reservoirs</b> <b>systems.</b> However, these complex procecures might not be easily adopted by the unsophisticated dam operators, which is the norm {{in most of the}} developing countries. This paper suggests a simple procedure designed to help dam operators develop and examine the operating rules necessary for the optimal operation of single use reservoirs which are quite popular in arid regions such as Saudi Arabia. The procedure involves first determining an optimal operating policy by stochastic dynamic programming (SDP), then examining the generated policy by a simulation model. Finally, once the operating rules are accepted, the model {{can be used as a}} computer-aided tool in real-time operation. A case study is also presented to demonstrate the use of the developed model, and to help compare the actual value of the objective function achieved through real time operation and the expected one obtained from SDP.
