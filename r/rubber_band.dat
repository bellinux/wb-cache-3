5|$|Bees {{beat their}} wings about 200 times a second. Their thorax muscles do not {{contract}} on each nerve firing, but rather vibrate like a plucked <b>rubber</b> <b>band.</b> This is efficient, since it lets the system consisting of muscle and wing operate at its resonant frequency, leading to low energy consumption. Further, it is necessary, since insect motor nerves generally cannot fire 200 times per second. These types of muscles are called asynchronous muscles and {{are found in}} the insect wing systems in families such as Hymenoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, and Hemiptera. Bumblebees must warm up their bodies considerably to get airborne at low ambient temperatures. Bumblebees have been known to reach an internal thoracic temperature of 30°C (86°F) using this method.|$|E
5|$|Generating {{alternative}} behaviours {{that the}} person can engage in instead of self-harm is one successful behavioural method that is employed to avoid self-harm. Techniques, aimed at keeping busy, may include journaling, taking a walk, participating in sports or exercise or being around friends when the person has the urge to harm themselves. The removal of objects used for self-harm from easy reach is also helpful for resisting self-harming urges. The provision of a card that allows the person to make emergency contact with counselling services should the urge to self-harm arise may also help prevent the act of self-harm. Alternative and safer methods of self-harm that do not lead to permanent damage, for example the snapping of a <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> on the wrist, may also help calm the urge to self-harm. Using biofeedback may help raise self-awareness of certain pre-occupations or particular mental state or mood that precede bouts of self-harming behaviour, and help identify techniques to avoid those pre-occupations before they lead to self-harm. Any avoidance or coping strategy must be appropriate to the individual's motivation and reason for harming.|$|E
5|$|Knuckles' Chaotix is a side-scrolling, action-platform {{game that}} shares {{the same basic}} {{gameplay}} elements that defined earlier entries in the Sonic series. New to this game, however, is a partner mechanic which tethers the player to a computer or human-controlled partner. This tether behaves like a <b>rubber</b> <b>band,</b> and requires the player(s) to use its physics to maneuver through the zones. Players can choose between playing as five different characters, each with their own unique set of moves. Knuckles the Echidna can glide and climb walls, Mighty the Armadillo can jump up and kick off walls, Espio the Chameleon can run along walls and ceilings, Vector the Crocodile can boost {{through the air and}} climb walls, and Charmy Bee can fly and hover in the air. There are two other partner characters, Heavy the Robot and Bomb, who hinder players' progress due to their slow or destructive nature, respectively. The story follows the group's efforts to save a mysterious island from Doctor Robotnik and Metal Sonic, who are using its magical Chaos Rings for their evil plans.|$|E
50|$|Brackets with hooks can be placed, or hooks can {{be created}} and affixed to the archwire to affix <b>rubber</b> <b>bands</b> to. The {{placement}} and configuration of the <b>rubber</b> <b>bands</b> {{will depend on the}} course of treatment and the individual patient. <b>Rubber</b> <b>bands</b> are made in different diameters, colors, sizes, and strengths. They are also typically available in two versions: colored or clear/opaque.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} shaped silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>bands</b> {{were created}} in 2002 by the Japanese design team Passkey Design, Yumiko Ohashi and Masonar Haneda. They made the bands in cute animal shapes to encourage sustainability by discouraging people from treating the <b>rubber</b> <b>bands</b> as disposable. Sold under the brand name Animal <b>Rubber</b> <b>Bands,</b> they won the Best Design award at the 2003 Japanese National Competition. These bands were not widely distributed in the United States, but in 2005 they were local hits in Guilford, Connecticut and at the Design Store at the New York City Museum of Modern Art.|$|R
25|$|The {{single seat}} {{aircraft}} {{was made from}} ash and spruce wood coated with aluminum powder. It used forward mounted finlets to stabilize the aircraft. It was powered by the last six cylinder engine built by the Wright Brothers with a <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> drive on the flywheel. The 406 cubic inch engine ran at 1,400 to 1560rpm powering two counterrotating propellers via chains.|$|E
25|$|The tensile {{strength}} of a material quantifies how much elongating stress the material will endure before failure. This {{is very important in}} applications that rely upon a polymer's physical strength or durability. For example, a <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> with a higher {{tensile strength}} will hold a greater weight before snapping. In general, tensile strength increases with polymer chain length and crosslinking of polymer chains.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, the {{convex hull}} or convex {{envelope}} {{of a set}} X of points in the Euclidean plane or in a Euclidean space (or, more generally, in an affine space over the reals) is the smallest convex set that contains X. For instance, when X is a bounded subset of the plane, the convex hull may be visualized as the shape enclosed by a <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> stretched around X.|$|E

25|$|During the {{capsizing}} and {{the subsequent}} reporting, the government's announcements, {{as well as those}} from the media, were inconsistent and inaccurate. An editorial in The Huffington Post stated that the governmental reports were like a <b>rubber</b> <b>band,</b> 'increasing at one moment and decreasing at another.' Newspapers such as The JoongAng Ilbo, MBN, and JTBC later made corrections and apologies concerning their earlier reports. Conspiracy theories were also present {{in the aftermath of the}} sinking.|$|E
25|$|Women staffed {{millions}} {{of jobs in}} community service roles, such as nursing, the USO, and the Red Cross. Unorganized women were encouraged to collect and turn in materials that were needed by the war effort. Women collected fats rendered during cooking, children formed balls of aluminum foil they peeled from chewing gum wrappers and also created <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> balls, which they contributed to the war effort. Hundreds of thousands of men joined civil defense units to prepare for disasters, such as enemy bombing.|$|E
25|$|Any {{physical}} process which models some computation {{can be interpreted}} as an analog computer. Some examples, invented for the purpose of illustrating the concept of analog computation, include using a bundle of spaghetti as a model of sorting numbers; a board, a set of nails, and a <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> as a model of finding the convex hull of a set of points; and strings tied together as a model of finding the shortest path in a network. These are all described in Dewdney (1984).|$|E

25|$|At small strains, elastin confers {{stiffness}} to {{the tissue}} and stores {{most of the}} strain energy. The collagen fibers are comparatively inextensible and are usually loose (wavy, crimped). With increasing tissue deformation the collagen is gradually stretched {{in the direction of}} deformation. When taut, these fibers produce a strong growth in tissue stiffness. The composite behavior is analogous to a nylon stocking, whose <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> does the role of elastin as the nylon does the role of collagen. In soft tissues the collagen limits the deformation and protects the tissues from injury.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, Healthways retailed Carib drysuits, made of 3-ply {{translucent}} gum rubber, {{and available}} in {{long and short}} versions. Entry was by a front chute with <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> closure. The full version included an integral hood and covered the feet. In 1957, they added the Aqua King and Aqua Flite dry suits to their product range. The Aqua King suit was a full-length waist entry suit, comprising hood, long sleeved shirt, booted pants and waistline sealing ring, and was made of seamless latex rubber. All these suits were available in small medium and large sizes.|$|E
25|$|Both EMG and NCS {{involve some}} measure of discomfort. EMG {{involves}} the use of a tiny needle that is inserted into specific muscles to test the associated muscle and nerve function. Both EMG & NCS involve very mild shocks that in normal patients are comparable to a <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> snapping on the skin. Although these tests can be very useful in CRPS, thorough informed consent needs to be obtained prior to the procedure, particularly in patients experiencing severe allodynia. In spite of the utility of the test, these patients may wish to decline the procedure in order to avoid discomfort.|$|E

25|$|Production of A Nero Wolfe Mystery {{coincided with}} Rex Stout's {{becoming}} a top-selling author some 30 {{years after his}} death. BookFinder.com, a web-search service that reports the most-sought out-of-print titles, reported in March 2003 that the top four most-wanted mysteries were Nero Wolfe novels: Where There's a Will (1940), The <b>Rubber</b> <b>Band</b> (1936), The Red Box (1937) and The League of Frightened Men (1935). The Red Box was the most-searched mystery title in August 2003, and the novel remained as number two on the list in 2004. In 2006, Too Many Women (1947) was fifth on BookFinder.com's list of most-sought out-of-print thrillers, whodunits, classics and modern mystery titles. In 2007, The Black Mountain was in the number five position.|$|E
25|$|The young Mueller enjoyed reading {{science fiction}} and, helped by his grandfather, {{woodworking}} – although his first model ship capsized. When he was aged 11 or 12 Mueller also built and raced model aircraft – such as gliders and <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> model airplanes. Always curious {{about how things}} worked, he also built radios, {{following in the footsteps}} of his father. Interested in these activities, the teenage Mueller wanted to be an aeronautical engineer but discovered that where he could afford to go to school, the Missouri School of Mines and Metallurgy (now Missouri University of Science and Technology) in Rolla, Missouri, there was no aeronautical engineering department. They did offer mechanical engineering, so he enrolled in that program but found it discouraging and switched to electrical engineering.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Anderson {{appeared}} in a MasterCard television commercial for Super Bowl XL. In it, he manages to cut the ropes binding him to a chair using a pine tree air freshener, uses an ordinary tube sock as the pulley for a zip-line, and somehow repairs and hot-wires a nonfunctional truck using a paper clip, ballpoint pen, <b>rubber</b> <b>band,</b> tweezers, nasal spray, and a turkey baster. In contrast to previous MasterCard commercials showing people making extravagant purchases to accomplish some mundane task, MacGyver is portrayed as escaping from some sort of deathtrap using less than $20 worth of common household items. The commercial ends by showing him purposefully buying an assortment of such things at a department store with his credit card (as a tongue-in-cheek explanation for how he seems to always have items he needs on hand no matter where he goes). Although the commercial implies that Anderson is portraying MacGyver, he is not identified.|$|E
