25|$|Congestive heart failure* is {{the result}} of any severe, {{overwhelming}} heart disease that most commonly results in pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), pleural effusion (fluid around the lungs), and/or ascites (fluid in the abdomen). It can be caused by the above two diseases, congenital heart defects such as patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary hypertension, heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) disease, or pericardial effusion. Signs depend on which side of the heart is affected. Left-sided heart failure results in rapid and/or difficulty breathing and sometimes coughing from a build-up of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema). <b>Right-sided</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> results in a large liver (congestion) and build-up of fluid in the abdomen (ascites), uncommonly fluid around the lungs (pleural effusion), or, rarely, peripheral edema.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the demographic, clinical and survival characteristics and to identify risk factors for mortality due to tricuspid valve dysplasia in UK dogs. Records of client-owned dogs diagnosed with tricuspid valve dysplasia at a referral centre were retrospectively reviewed. Only dogs diagnosed with tricuspid valve dysplasia based on the presence of a <b>right-sided</b> <b>heart</b> murmur identified prior to one year of age, and confirmed with Doppler echocardiography, were included. Dogs with concomitant cardiac diseases, pulmonary hypertension and/or trivial tricuspid regurgitation were excluded. Analysed data included signalment, reason for presentation, clinical signs, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic features, survival status and cause of death. Survival times and risk factors for mortality were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression. Eighteen dogs met inclusion criteria. Border collies were over-represented (p= 0. 014). Dogs were most frequently referred for investigation of heart murmur. The most common arrhythmia was atrial fibrillation (n= 3). Median survival time from diagnosis of tricuspid valve dysplasia was 2775 days (range 1 - 3696 days; 95 % CI 1542. 41 - 4007. 59) and from onset of <b>right-sided</b> congestive <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> was 181 days (range 1 - 2130 days; 95 % CI 0 - 455. 59). Syncope was the sole risk factor for cardiac death. In this population of UK dogs, tricuspid valve dysplasia was uncommon but, when severe, frequently led to <b>right-sided</b> congestive <b>heart</b> <b>failure.</b> Prognosis was favourable for mild and moderate tricuspid dysplasia. Survival time was reduced with <b>right-sided</b> congestive <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> but varied widely. Risk of cardiac death was significantly increased if syncope had occurred...|$|R
2500|$|Some {{impairment}} in lung function is almost universally seen {{in patients with}} diffuse scleroderma on pulmonary function testing; however, {{it does not necessarily}} cause symptoms, such as shortness of breath.

2500|$|The {{characteristic}} pulmonary function {{finding in}} asbestosis is a restrictive ventilatory defect.

[...] In severe cases, the drastic reduction in lung function due to the stiffening of the lungs and reduced TLC may induce <b>right-sided</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> (cor pulmonale). In addition to a restrictive defect, asbestosis may produce reduction in diffusion capacity and a low amount of oxygen in the blood of the arteries.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Severe {{high-output}} cardiac {{failure is}} a serious complication of high-flow vascular access requiring immediate intervention. Ischemic hepatitis {{is defined as a}} massive increase in serum transaminase levels due to an imbalance between hepatic oxygen supply and demand in the absence of other acute causes of liver damage. It is typically preceded by hypotension, hypoxemia, or both, and occurs mostly in elderly patients with <b>right-sided</b> congestive <b>heart</b> <b>failure.</b> Case presentation We report a fatal case of acute liver failure in an 84 -year-old Caucasian man with high-output cardiac failure due to arteriovenous hemodialysis access. The chronological sequence of acute liver failure in the context of vascular access created two days before suggests that ischemic hepatitis was the result of high-output cardiac failure due to vascular access. Conclusions A thorough cardiac assessment should be performed in patients with severe cardiac disease prior to placing an arteriovenous access, and arteriovenous fistula should be the preferred vascular access. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of naloxone on systemic hemodynamics and reflex function in dogs with congestive <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> induced by rapid pacing. Background. We have shown previously that naloxone, an opiate receptor antagonist, improves cardiac output, aortic blood pressure, systolic performance and the baroreflex function in conscious dogs with chronic <b>right-sided</b> congestive <b>heart</b> <b>failure.</b> However, whether endogenous opioids also play a role in mediating the reduction of myocardial and baroreflex function in animals with left <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> remains controversial. Methods. We administered naloxone (1 mg/kg body weight) and normal saline solution to 15 dogs with pacing-induced congestive <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> (225 beats/min for 8 weeks) and 11 control dogs. In addition to systemic hemodynamic measurements, the slope of pressure-area relation obtained from echocardiography with intravenous bolus injection of phenylephrine was taken as a load-independent index of myocardial contractility. Baroreflex function was estimated by the slope of the regression line relating systolic aortic pressure and RRE interval. Results. Plasma beta-endorphin levels were elevated in dags with congestive <b>heart</b> <b>failure.</b> Naloxone administration increased heart rate, mean aortic pressure, first derivative of left ventricular pressure, cardiac output and myocardial contractility in pacing-induced congestive <b>heart</b> <b>failure.</b> These changes correlated significantly with basal plasma beta-endorphin levels and were accompanied by increases in plasma beta-endorphin and catecholamines after naloxone administration. However, unlike the hemodynamic and cardiac effects of naloxone, baroreflex function did not change after naloxone in dogs with congestive <b>heart</b> <b>failure.</b> Conclusions. The increase in basal plasma beta-endorphin suggests that the endogenous opiate system is activated in lef-tsided congestive <b>heart</b> <b>failure.</b> Because naloxone improves the systemic hemodynamics and myocardial contractile function under this condition, the endogenous opioids appear to play an important role in mediating the myocardial depression that occurs in <b>heart</b> <b>failure.</b> However, the endogenous opiate system has no apparent effect on the regulation of baroreflex control in <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> induced by rapid pacing...|$|R

In dogs, echocardiographic evaluation of right atrial enlargement is thusfar only based on subjective assessment. The aim was to evaluate reliability of the right atrial area index (RAAI) to characterize right atrial size and PH severity in dogs. The study was prospective, multicenter and observational. We included 103 client owned dogs: 45 dogs with PH and 58 healthy dogs as control group. PH was classified according to tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient (TRPG) in mild (TRPG: 36 - 50 mmHg; n = 15 dogs), moderate (TRPG: 51 - 75 mmHg; n = 9 dogs) and severe (TRPG > 75 mmHg; n = 21 dogs).

Animals A total of 119 client-owned dogs, 48 dogs with PAH and 71 control dogs. Methods Prospective observational study. Pulmonary arterial hypertension was classified according to the tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient (TRPG) as mild (36 – 50 mmHg), moderate (51 – 75 mmHg), or severe (> 75 mmHg).

40|$|Chronic passive {{congestion}} (CPC) and centrilobular necrosis (CLN) {{are well}} recognized pathologic changes, but their exact relationship to {{different forms of}} cardiac dysfunction is uncertain. We reviewed clinical data and hepatic, renal, and adrenal morphology related to cardiac dysfunction in 1000 autopsy subjects at The Johns Hopkins Hospital whose hearts had been studied after postmortem arteriography and fixation in distention. Fourteen pathologic variables, including body and organ size, and microscopic changes graded on a semiquantitative scale, and 18 clinical variables including congestive <b>heart</b> <b>failure,</b> shock, and cardiovascular disease, were analyzed statistically. Distinct patterns of cardiac dysfunction emerged for the two spectra of hepatic morphologic change. Among patients with variable CPC, but slight or absent CLN, the amount of CPC was predicted in a multivariate analysis by severity of <b>right-sided</b> congestive <b>heart</b> <b>failure.</b> CPC severity correlated with cardiac weight and chamber enlargement (P less than 0. 001). Among patients with variable CLN, but slight or absent CPC, CLN was predicted by profound hypotension and by renal failure. In addition, CLN, but not CPC, was significantly correlated with renal acute tubular necrosis (P less than 0. 001) and adrenal cortical medullary junction necrosis (P less than 0. 05), two lesions associated with shock. Among all 1000 patients CPC and CLN were highly significantly correlated (P less than 0. 001).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Arrhythmogenic right {{ventricular}} cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is {{a primary}} myocardial disease of incompletely resolved pathogenesis and is a largely unappreciated cause of sudden death in the young. METHODS AND RESULTS: Clinical features of 12 domestic cats with ARVC (7 male; 1 to 20 years old, mean 7. 3 +/- 5. 2 years) were <b>right-sided</b> congestive <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> (n= 8), supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (n= 5), ventricular tachycardia (n= 3), polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias (n= 6), and right bundle-branch block (n= 5). ARVC was suspected in all 8 cats examined with echocardiography by marked enlargement of the right ventricle (RV) and right atrium and tricuspid regurgitation. Eight died of cardiovascular disease and 4 died of noncardiac conditions. At autopsy, hearts of ARVC cats were characterized grossly by moderate-to-severe RV cavity enlargement and wall thinning (n= 12) and apical aneurysm formation (n= 6). Histology demonstrated pronounced RV lesions in all 12 ARVC cats, including marked myocardial injury (myocyte death and atrophy) and repair (fibrous and/or fatty replacement). Injury and repair were also evident in the left ventricle (LV) in 10 cats, and 2 had involvement of both atria. Myocarditis was present in 10 of the 12 ARVC cats. Apoptosis was detected in 9 ARVC cats (mean apoptotic index, 28 +/- 23 % RV, 21 +/- 19 % LV, and 17 +/- 15 % ventricular septum) but not in controls. CONCLUSIONS: In the common domestic cat, we identified a clinically relevant cardiomyopathy that closely mimics ARVC in humans.
