30|$|Access to robust 24 -h IR {{coverage}} {{should be}} a priority for all acute care hospitals. For this duty, the number of interventional radiologists must be sufficient. However, with many hospitals having limited or, in some instances, no direct access to IR services, the provision of IR services remains variable.

In Europe, about 60 % of radiological departments can cover IR emergencies. This is not enough, however, and is a problem that needs to be urgently addressed.

These devices are based on semiconductor (Si and GaAs) pixel detectors of different thickness, read-out by custom designed integrated circuits. To assess the imaging capability of such systems, the images of a mammographic phantom have been acquired in standard conditions for a clinical examination. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of details simulating tumor masses has been evaluated. The same phantom has been also radiographed by three different commercial digital mammographic systems in the same reference conditions and a comparison in terms of SNR has been carried out. The spatial resolution of the single photon counting systems has also been evaluated by measuring the line spread function with the edge technique and then calculating the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF).

40|$|Introduction The Gamma Knife {{system is}} {{designed}} solely for non-invasive treatment of brain disorders, and it benefits from stereotactic surgical techniques. Dose calculations required in the system are performed by GammaPlan code; in this code, brain tissue is considered uniform. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of Gamma Knife system on the obtained dose through simulating a real human brain phantom. Materials and Methods In this study, a Monte Carlo simulation code (MCNPX 2. 7) was employed to simulate Gamma Knife system. Brain tissue equivalent Snyder phantom and combinations were considered according to International Commission on <b>Radiological</b> <b>Units</b> (ICRU) - 44 report. Results To ensure accuracy of the simulations, patientâs head was modeled by a spherical water phantom. At this point, the dosimetry parameters were compared with those obtained by the Monte Carlo code EGS 4 and good consistency was observed (less than 7 % difference). At the next stage, the above dosimetry parameters were compared with those obtained experimentally by polystyrene phantom and EDR 2 dosimetry film and improved consistency was detected (less than 0. 5 % difference). Finally, the Snyder phantom, as the human brain, was simulated. The Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) and penumbra decreased by 4. 7 % and 18 %, respectively. Moreover, an isocenter dose reduction of 30 - 40 %, compared to the water phantom, was noted. Conclusion The calculation of the real phantom showed that water and polystyrene could function similarly, while evaluating dosimetry parameters in the Gamma Knife system; thus, water and polystyrene are not appropriate phantom matters for this purpose...|$|R

In the present study, entrance surface doses (ESDs) were measured in twelve (12) healthcare centres consisting of 15 <b>radiological</b> <b>units</b> using thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs). Seven radiological procedures such as; chest PA, abdomen AP, pelvis AP, lumbar spine AP, skull AP, knee AP, and hand AP frequently carried out in Nigeria were included in the study, and their local diagnostic {{reference levels}} (LDRLs) were determined. The values of the determined LDRLs were compared with established NDRLs in UK, US, Slovenia, Italy and Brazil. The LDRLs determined in the two groups (healthcare centres) studied ranged from 1. 78 to 3. 01, 2. 71 to 2. 84, 2. 11 to 3. 79, 3. 93 to 8. 79, 1. 06 to 1. 73 and 1. 10 to 1. 44 Â mGy for chest PA, pelvis AP, lumbar spine AP, skull AP, knee AP and hand AP respectively. Large variations were found among the X-ray units studied even within the same centre. Entrance surface doses obtained in pelvis AP and lumbar spine AP in both GROUP A and were found to be lower than the NRPB-HPA 2010 review for UK, while in all other five examinations, value of the measured entrance surface dose (ESD) are higher than the doses reported in the UK review.

40|$|Electron {{paramagnetic}} resonance (EPR) dosimetry is {{a physical}} method {{for the assessment of}} absorbed dose from ionising radiation. It is based on the measurement of stable radiation induced radicals in human calcified tissues (primarily in tooth enamel). EPR dosimetry with teeth is now firmly established in retrospective dosimetry. It is a powerful method for providing information on exposure to ionising radiation many years after the event, since the 'signal' is 'stored' in the tooth or the bone. This technique is of particular relevance to relatively low dose exposures or when the results of conventional dosimetry are not available (e. g. in accidental circumstances). The use of EPR dosimetry, as an essential tool for retrospective assessment of radiation exposure {{is an important part of}} radioepidemiological studies and also provides data to select appropriate countermeasures based on retrospective evaluation of individual doses. Despite well established regulations and protocols for maintaining radiation protection dose limits, the assurance that these limits will not be exceeded cannot be guaranteed, thus providing new challenges for development of accurate methods of individual dose assessment. To meet some of these challenges, in 1998 the IAEA initiated a co-ordinated research project (CRP) with the objective to review the available methods, current research and development in EPR biodosimetry technology, which may be of practical use. The major goal of this CRP was to investigate the use of EPR biodosimetry for reconstruction of absorbed dose in tooth enamel with the aim of providing Member States with up-to-date, and generally agreed upon advice regarding the most suitable procedures and the best focus for their research. The co-ordinated research project was conducted over four years and this publication presents the results and findings by a group of investigators from different countries.
