5|$|On {{the morning}} of 10 July, former Prime Minister Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain and Federal Religious Affairs Minister Muhammad Ijaz-ul-Haq {{declared}} that peace negotiations via loudspeaker and mobile phone had failed. Within minutes, the Special Service Group were issued orders to storm the mosque. Pakistan Army spokesman Waheed Arshad said troops began by attacking and breaching the mosque {{from the south and}} assaulted it from three directions at 4:00am (23:00 GMT). The forces immediately came under gunfire from heavily armed militants hunkered down behind sandbagged positions on the roof and from holes in the walls of the mosque. The SSG quickly cleared the mosque's ground floor, amid explosions coming from the mosque. About 30 women and children <b>ran</b> <b>toward</b> the advancing SSG operators and managed to escape unharmed.|$|E

25|$|On March 15, Herrera’s platoon was {{advancing}} along {{a wooded}} road near the French town of Mertzwiller when it ran into two German machine-gun emplace-ments. Caught in a deadly crossfire {{between the two}} guns, the GIs dived for cover. Fearing that his comrades would be cut to pieces, Herrera stood up and <b>ran</b> <b>toward</b> the closest enemy position, firing his rifle from the hip. He tossed two grenades at the machine-gun nest; the concussion knocked the Germans down. Then he was on them, and all eight soldiers threw down their weapons and surrendered to him.|$|E
50|$|In normal play, if {{the ball}} is hit into the infield, {{one of the players}} will <b>run</b> <b>toward</b> the ball while another <b>runs</b> <b>toward</b> the base that is no longer covered. For instance, if {{the ball is}} hit toward the second baseman, he will <b>run</b> <b>toward</b> the ball while the shortstop <b>runs</b> <b>toward</b> second base. This allows the fielding player to throw the ball to the player on the base to attempt a put out. However, during a stolen base attempt the normal {{gameplay}} and positioning is altered. In the typical case, a baserunner on first base will start running toward second, causing the infielders to move toward that base in order to tag the runner when the ball is thrown to them from the pitcher or catcher. This reaction places the infielders out of position for a hit ball, with gaps opening at midway points between first and second and second and third.|$|R

25|$|On April 30, 1598, the northward-bound Spanish conquistadors crossed large {{sand dunes}} about 27 {{miles south of}} present-day {{downtown}} El Paso.

Don Juan de Oñate, a New Spain-born conquistador of Spanish parents, was an expedition leader who ordered a big feast north of the Río Grande {{in what is now}} San Elizario.

25|$|Roberts backed {{a pickup}} truck {{up to the front}} of the Amish schoolhouse and entered the school at {{approximately}} 10:25a.m. EDT, shortly after the children had returned from recess. He asked the teacher, Emma Mae Zook, and the students if they had seen a missing clevis pin on the road. Survivors said that Roberts was mumbling his words and was not making direct eye contact. After the occupants of the classroom denied seeing a clevis pin, Roberts walked out to his truck and reappeared in the classroom holding a Springfield XD 9mm handgun. He ordered the boys to help him carry items into the classroom from the back of his pickup. Zook and her mother, who was visiting the schoolhouse, took this opportunity to escape the school and <b>ran</b> <b>toward</b> a nearby farm to get help. Roberts saw them leave, and ordered one of the boys to stop them, threatening to shoot everyone if the women got away.|$|E

25|$|The attack {{began at}} around 10:30A.M. when six gunmen, wearing {{explosive}} belts entered the school {{from the back}} through a cemetery adjacent to the school after having scaled the walls. Army Public School is located at Warsak Road near the Peshawar Cantt, and is part of Army Public Schools and College Systems that runs 146 schools in Pakistan. Before entering the school, the gunmen {{set fire to the}} Suzuki Bolan ST41 van in which they had arrived. The terrorists, bearing automatic weapons,and grenades, moved straight toward the auditorium located at the centre of the complex and opened fire indiscriminately on the children who were gathered there for First aid training. According to the Director General of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the public relations department of the Pakistani military, Major-General Asim Bajwa, the terrorists did not intend to take any hostages but instead wanted to kill as many pupils as they could. As the terrorists opened fire, many of the pupils <b>ran</b> <b>toward</b> the two exits {{on the other side of}} the auditorium, but many of them were gunned down in the garden.|$|E
25|$|On Friday, 20 July 1923, Villa {{was killed}} while visiting Parral. He {{frequently}} made trips from his ranch to Parral for banking and other errands, where he generally felt secure. Villa was usually {{accompanied by his}} entourage of Dorados, or bodyguards, but {{for some unknown reason}} on that day he had gone into the town without most of them, taking with him only three guards and two other employees. He went to pick up a consignment of gold from the local bank with which to pay his Canutillo ranch staff. While driving back through the city in his black 1919 Dodge touring car, Villa passed by a school, and a pumpkinseed vendor <b>ran</b> <b>toward</b> his car and shouted Viva Villa!, a signal to a group of seven riflemen who then appeared {{in the middle of the}} road and fired more than 40 shots into the automobile. In the fusillade, nine dumdum bullets, normally used for hunting big game, hit Villa in the head and upper chest, killing him instantly.|$|E
25|$|Around noon on July 23, 1968, a {{call was}} made to the Cleveland Police {{reporting}} an abandoned vehicle on Beulah Avenue between E. 123rd Street and Lakeview Road. The location was just a block north of Evans' home (at the intersection of Auburndale Avenue and Lakeview). The vehicle was ticketed at 1:25 PM, but a tow truck did not arrive until dusk. It parked {{on the north side}} of Beulah Avenue near the intersection with Lakeview Road. According to tow truck worker William McMillan, the truck backed up to the abandoned car, and then McMillan got out. He was checking the license plate of the automobile a few moments later when a man with a shotgun standing at the corner of Beulah and Auburndale shot him in the back. An official chronology later placed the attack on McMillan at 8:25 PM. Another man hiding in the bushes near the front of the truck fired, and shot McMillan in the side. McMillan's coworker, still in the truck, radioed for help at 8:28 PM. According to McMillan, Ahmed Evans—armed with a carbine—walked on the sidewalk across the street and demanded to know if he was stealing cars. McMillan stood and said he had no weapons. He <b>ran</b> <b>toward</b> and then north up E. 123rd Street, and Evans shot him in the right side. An African American woman on E. 123rd Street gave refuge to McMillan.|$|E

25|$|The 1908 pennant {{races in}} both the AL and NL {{were among the most}} {{exciting}} ever witnessed. The conclusion of the National League season, in particular, involved a bizarre chain of events, {{often referred to as the}} Merkle Boner. On September 23, 1908, the New York Giants and Chicago Cubs played a game in the Polo Grounds. Nineteen-year-old rookie first baseman Fred Merkle, later to become one of the best players at his position in the league, was on first base, with teammate Moose McCormick on third with two outs and the game tied. Giants shortstop Al Bridwell socked a single, scoring McCormick and apparently winning the game. However, Merkle, instead of advancing to second base, <b>ran</b> <b>toward</b> the clubhouse to avoid the spectators mobbing the field, which at that time was a common, acceptable practice. The Cubs' second baseman, Johnny Evers, noticed this. In the confusion that followed, Evers claimed to have retrieved the ball and touched second base, forcing Merkle out and nullifying the run scored. Evers brought this to the attention of the umpire that day, Hank O'Day, who after some deliberation called the runner out. Because of the state of the field O'Day thereby called the game. Despite the arguments by the Giants, the league upheld O'Day's decision and ordered the game replayed at the end of the season, if necessary. It turned out that the Cubs and Giants ended the season tied for first place, so the game was indeed replayed, and the Cubs won the game, the pennant, and subsequently the World Series (the last Cubs Series victory until 2016).|$|E
500|$|Alison {{studied at}} Mount Temple Comprehensive School. At {{the age of}} twelve, she met Paul Hewson, {{who was in the}} year above at the school. He pursued her immediately, but she {{initially}} kept her distance, labeling him [...] "an eejit" [...] even though she secretly admired him. In September 1974, Paul's mother Iris died suddenly, leaving him emotionally adrift and in conflict with his father and brother. Soon after, Alison began taking care of Paul: cleaning his clothes, walking to school with him, and cooking for him. [...] In September 1976, Paul met the other members of what would become U2; the band members adopted nicknames, and Paul soon became known as Bono. At around the same time, he and Ali, as she was known, began dating, and soon became a steady couple in the Dublin area. It took Stewart a while to enjoy the band's music, as her own tastes <b>ran</b> <b>toward</b> her father's Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole records.|$|E
500|$|The Cook County Coroner's Office took 70 day {{sessions}}, 20 night {{sessions and}} 450 witnesses examinations {{to collect evidence}} about the riots. Its report stated that on July 27, 1919, Eugene Williams, an African American youth, drifted towards an informally segregated beach on the South Side while holding onto a railroad tie. He was subsequently hit by a stone as a white man threw rocks at him and other African Americans to drive them away from their part of the 29th Street beach in the city's Douglas community on the South Side. A witness recalled seeing a single white male standing on a breakwater [...] from the raft of the African Americans and throwing rocks at them. Williams was struck in the forehead. He then panicked, lost {{his grip on the}} railroad tie, and drowned. The assailant <b>ran</b> <b>toward</b> 29th Street, where a different fight had already started when African Americans tried to use a section of the beach there, in defiance of its tacit segregation.|$|E

500|$|In 1930, Birkett was {{involved}} in the so-called Blazing Car murder case. On 6 November 1930, two men returning home in Northampton noticed a bright light in the distance and saw a man come out of a ditch {{at the side of the}} road, glance back toward the light and say [...] "looks like somebody has had a bonfire". The two young men <b>ran</b> <b>toward</b> the light, saw it was a burning car and fetched a policeman. When the fires died away, a body was found inside the boot of a car with a face so charred it was impossible to determine the identity of the man; the numberplate of the car was intact, however, and traced to an Alfred Arthur Rouse. Rouse was arrested and appeared at Northampton Crown Court on 26 January 1931, charged with the murder of an unknown man. He was defended by Donald Finnemore, and the Crown was represented by Birkett and Richard Elwes. Rouse was damned by a series of events. When arrested, he made statements such as [...] "I'm very glad it's over" [...] and [...] "I'm responsible" [...] and that the car engine had been off at the time of the fire, ruling out the possibility of accidental ignition. When he appeared as a witness, the defendant claimed that after giving an unknown man a lift, he had found that he was running out of petrol and had asked the passenger to take the spare can in the car and fill up the fuel tank. While he was doing this, Rouse testified that he went to the side of the road to urinate, and while there heard a large explosion. He said he saw a large flame and became convinced the petrol tank would explode. As such he ran away as fast as possible, at which point he ran into the two young men on the road.|$|E

[...] On third down, Newman <b>ran</b> <b>toward</b> the sideline and into the endzone for the game's only score.

[...] At Lenzberg, about 100 government soldiers formed to resist the militia, and brought their guns in position.
