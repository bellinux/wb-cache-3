40|$|Stem mining weevils, <b>rape</b> <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> (Ceutorhynchus napi Gyll. 1837) {{and cabbage}} stem weevil (Ceutorhynchus pallidactylus Marsh. 1802) have become more {{important}} oliseed rape pests. <b>Rape</b> <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> is present in middle and west European countries and {{cabbage stem weevil}} is present in almost all European countries. The most important morphological difference between adults is colour of their legs. Biological and ecological characteristics of these two pests are similar, stem mining weevils are observed as pest complex. Differences in biology cause different approach in pest control. Both species have single generation annually. Larvae feed inside the petioles and stems of oilseed rape. Phyrethroids are used for adult control of stem mining weevils...|$|E
40|$|The <b>rape</b> <b>stem</b> <b>weevil,</b> Ceutorhynchus napi Gyll., is {{a serious}} pest of winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) crops in Europe causing severe yield loss. In {{currently}} used oilseed rape cultivars no resistance to C. napi has been identified. Resynthesized lines of B. napus have potential to broaden the genetic variability and may improve resistance to insect pests. In this study, the susceptibility to C. napi of three cultivars, one breeding line and five resynthesized lines of oilseed rape was compared in a semi-field plot experiment under multi-choice conditions. Plant acceptance for oviposition was estimated by {{counting the number of}} C. napi larvae in stems. The larval instar index and the dry body mass were assessed as indicators of larval performance. The extent of larval feeding within stems was determined by the stem injury coefficient. Morphological stem traits and stem contents of glucosinolates were assessed as potential mediators of resistance. The resynthesized line S 30 had significantly fewer larvae than the cultivars Express 617 and Visby and the resynthesized lines L 122 and L 16. The low level of larval infestation in S 30 was associated with a low larval instar and stem injury index. Low numbers of larvae were not correlated with the length or diameter of stems, and the level of stem glucosinolates. As indicated by the low larval infestation and slow larval development the resistance of S 30 to C. napi is based on both antixenotic and antibiotic properties of the genotypes. The resynthesized line S 30 should therefore be introduced into B. napus breeding programs to enhance resistance against C. napi...|$|E
40|$|Many organic farmers {{hesitate}} to grow winter oilseed rape (WOSR), despite its usefulness for crop rotations and animal fodder, {{because it is}} attacked by many insects, which are difficult to control without chemical treatments. In a geographically broad network of farmer’s fields, we analysed the effect of various crop management factors and of the surrounding field environment on a large range of insects known to damage WOSR: root maggot (Delia radicum L.), {{cabbage stem flea beetle}} (Psylliodes chrysocephala L.), <b>rape</b> <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> (Ceuthorhynchus napi Gyl) and pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus F.). Our results confirm the effect of sowing date, plant density and soil tillage regime on root maggot attacks and cabbage stem flea beetle larva infestation. Early sowing tended to increase root maggot damage whereas it was associated with a lower level of attack of cabbage stem flea beetle. High plant density tended to decrease the damage or the attack of all insects. We show that nitrogen availability in the soil affect cabbage stem flea beetle, stem weevil levels and pollen beetle damage: the negative effect of soil nitrogen content on pollen beetle damage {{may be related to the}} significant effect of nitrogen on plant vigour and, therefore, to the compensation of pollen beetle damage on new racemes. If all insects were considered together, the proportion of land under WOSR in the region and the surrounding environment had a significant effect on pest occurrence. In regions with a high proportion of land under WOSR, the proportion of plants attacked by root maggot and pollen beetle tended to increase. Conversely, regions with high proportions of land under WOSR tended to have a smaller proportion of plants with cabbage stem flea beetle larvae or damage, whatever the environment surrounding the field. For almost all the pests considered, the fields displaying the most severe pest attacks in regions with more than 1. 2 % WOSR were bounded by trees, hedges and bushes. Conversely, in regions with a lower percentage of land under WOSR, woodland around the field reduced the occurrence of pest attack...|$|E
40|$|Mixing {{plant species}} in agroecosystems is {{highlighted}} as an agroecological solution to reduce pesticides and fertilizers while maintaining profitability. In the French context, intercropping frost-sensitive legume crops with winter oilseed rape is potentially interesting {{and began to}} be implemented by farmers. In this study we aimed at measuring the services and disservices of this intercrop with three different legume mixtures, in terms of growth and yield for rapeseed, ground cover of weeds in autumn and damage caused by <b>rape</b> winter <b>stem</b> <b>weevil.</b> The experiment was carried out at four sites from 2011 to 2014. We showed higher total aerial dry weights and total aerial nitrogen contents in the intercrops compared to sole winter oilseed rape in November. The companion plants contributed to the control of weeds and the mitigation of <b>rape</b> winter <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> damage, notably through {{the increase in the}} total aerial weight. In spring, after destruction of the companion plants, the intercrops had partially compensated a reduction in the N fertilization rate (- 30 kg per hectare) in terms of aerial nitrogen content in rapeseed, with no consequences on the yield which was maintained or even increased. There were probably other interactions such as an improvement in rapeseed root exploration. The consequences were an increase in the nitrogen use efficiency in intercrops. The intercrop with faba bean and lentil showed the best results in terms of autumn growth, weed control, reduction in <b>rape</b> winter <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> damage, and rapeseed N content in spring and yield. Intercropping frost-sensitive legume crops with winter oilseed rape is thus a promising way to reconcile yield and reduction in pesticides and fertilizer use and perhaps to benefit more widely to the cropping system...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} at Ruakura {{has shown that}} the negative correlation between Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> (Lirtronotu bonariasis (Kuschel)) population survival (egg to adult) and egg density was density dependent. Density dependent mortalities could arise from pathogens, predators, parasitoids, larval combat and chemical releases by larvae andlor by the host plant. Large mortalities arising from pathogens, parasitoids, soil invertebrate predators and possibly Carabidae and Staphylinidae predators can be discounted in populations at Wairakei in the central North Island. Even without knowing the causative agent of the population mortality, any considerations for releases of natural enemies for biologcal control of <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> should act to augment this existing control.

Studies in the EU MASTER project show that carabid beetles can feed on larvae of oilseed rape pests (e. g. Piper & Williams, 2004), but to identify them as potential biocontrol agents it must be shown that significant numbers encounter the prey in the field. In this two-year study, the spatio-temporal {{relationships between}} carabids and cabbage stem flea beetle (Psylliodes chrysocephala) have already been reported (Warner et al., 2003). Now, we compare carabid distributions with those of pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus), cabbage <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> (<b>stem</b> <b>weevil)</b> (Ceutorhynchus pallidactylus) and cabbage seed weevil (seed weevil) (Ceutorhynchus assimilis) larvae dropping to the soil to pupate...|$|R

40|$|The Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil,</b> Listronotus bonariensis (Kuschel) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is {{the most}} {{important}} pest species in New Zealand, costing the pastoral industry an estimated NZ$ 78 - 251 m per year (Prestidge et al., 1991). The parasitoid wasp Microctonus hyperodae Loan (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) was released in New Zealand in 1991 as a potential biological control agent of the weevil (Goldson et al., 1994). As M. hyperodae is a pro-ovigenic species, its lifetime complement of eggs is set at adult emergence (Phillips, 1998). Adult wasp fitness is likely to be affected by host nutrition, as resources carried over from immature stages to the adult stage of parasitoids can vary with the size and nutritional quality of the host (Jervis et al., 2001). The fecundity of Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> can increase after the addition of pollen to its diet (Evans. and Barratt, 1995). Conversely, a decrease in gonad development (i. e., vitellarium development and percentage of females with oocyte resorption) can occur after consumption of ryegrass containing endophyte (Barker and Addison, 1996). This research investigates tri-trophic-Ievel interactions on parasitoid fitness (i. e., egg load and body size) by assessing field-collected adult weevils, and by providing bee-collected pollen, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench cv. Katowase) pollen, ryegrass-only (Lolium multiflorum L. cv. Tama), or ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lambrechtsen cv. Aries) containing endophyte (Neotyphodium lolii (Latch, Christensen and Samuels) Glenn, Bacon and Hanlin in the host diet in the laboratory. A survey was conducted in the Lincoln area to what extent pollen was part of the diet of field collected Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevils.</b> The frequency and types of pollen grains consumed were analysed. Also, gut fullness (in terms of ryegrass particle content), parasitoid larval presence, weevil gender and weevil gonad development were also assessed. Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> adults fed on pollen in the field, although a low proportion of them contained pollen in their gut. Gonad development was positively correlated with the extent of pollen consumption (i. e., number of individuals with sexually mature gonads). A cage experiment was conducted in the laboratory. Potentially parasitised adult Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevils</b> were collected from ryegrass on roadsides in the Lincoln area during 2004. They were randomly allocated to four treatments: ryegrass-only (control), ryegrass plus bee collected pollen, ryegrass plus buckwheat pollen, and ryegrass with endophyte, each replicated four times. Water was provided in every treatment. The parasitoids that emerged were assessed for size (i. e., hind leg tibial length) and potential fecundity (i. e., egg load) (see Phillips and Baird, 2001). Despite the fact that the addition of bee-collected or buckwheat pollen to the host diet had no significant effect on the number of adult parasitoids emerged, their body size or egg load (P > 0. 05), some factors that could have affected a potentially positive correlation between parasitoid fitness and pollen consumption are discussed. Similarly, the addition of ryegrass with endophyte had no significant effect on the number of adult parasitoids emerged, their body size or egg load (P > 0. 05). This leads to the suggestion that biological control (i. e., M. hyperodae) and plant resistance (i. e., endophyte) strategies can work in a complementary way in integrated pest management programmes. The concept of benefiting the third trophic level with 'resource subsidies' made available selectively to the second level has the potential to lead to the suggestion of a new mechanism for enhancing parasitoid fitness, that is 'indirect' conservation biocontrol...|$|R
40|$|Some {{aspects of}} the {{presence}} of systemic endophytic fungi in agriculturally important New Zealand grasses were studied in relation to plant breeding. Seedling resistance to adult Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> feeding in perennial ryegrass, Italian ryegrass and tall fescue was found {{to be related to the}} presence of their respective Acremonium endophytes in the seed rather than to plant genetic resistance. In addition a study of perennial ryegrass revealed that this resistance was independent of endophyte viability. The seedling resistance conferred by the endophyte of Italian ryegrass was found to be beneficial for field establishment. This endophyte differs from that in perennial ryegrass and tall fescue in that it does not confer resistance to Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> on mature plants, but only on seedlings. The extent of plant genetic seedling tolerance to adult Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> feeding was limited to broad inter-specific differences, with tall fescue more tolerant than perennial ryegrass and both of these more tolerant than Italian ryegrass. This ranking corresponds with previous observations on feeding preference on mature plants. A study of factors affecting the concentration of endophyte mycelia in infected seed of perennial ryegrass revealed that plant genetic factors had little effect. The major factors studied were: 1) the endophyte concentration in the maternal parent plant directly influenced the endophyte concentration in the seed. 2) nitrogen fertilizer applications to a seed crop reduced the concentration of mycelia in the seed, with earlier applications having a greater effect. 3) application of the fungicide propiconazole (Tilt) to a seed crop reduced the endophyte concentration in the seed. 4) the endophyte concentration in the seed was found to directly influence the endophyte concentration in seedlings, six month old plants and that of seed harvested from a first year seed crop. As there have been no previous reports of tetraploid perennial ryegrass cultivars with endophyte an experiment was conducted to determine if these could be developed by the standard procedure of colchicine treatment. The results revealed that endophyte was retained following colchicine treatment...|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} was planned and undertaken to obtain further {{evidence on the}} association of the Loliumendophyte (a fungus parasitic in some perennial ryegrass) with the occurrence of ryegrass staggers in sheep (Fletcher & Harvey, 1981). In the experiment, 39 sheep grazing four plots established with perennial rye-grass seed (Lolium perenne) highly (> 90 %) infected with the endophyte all developed clinical ryegrass staggers over a 26 day grazing period. The same number of sheep grazing plots established from seed found to have negligible (< 3 X) endophyte infec-t ion showed no evidence of ryegrass staggers. The results clearly confirm that Lo/&m-endophvte infested ryegrass pastures are {{closely associated with the}} occurrence of ryegrass staggers in sheep. Observations made during regrowth of the ryegrass plots {{at the end of the}} grazing period showed that there was a 3 to 4 -fold greater production of dry matter from the high endophyte plots than from the low endophyte plots. The poor regrowth and low production recorded in low endophyte plots was found to be largely due to pasture predation by the Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> (Lisfronotus bonariensis). There is a firm indication that Lolium-endophyte infection of ryegrass confers resistance to <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> predations. This finding is discussed in relation to the field control of ryegrass staggers.

40|$|Loss in seed {{yield and}} {{therefore}} decrease in plant fitness due to simultaneous attacks by multiple herbivores {{is not necessarily}} additive, as demonstrated in evolutionary studies on wild plants. However, {{it is not clear}} how this transfers to crop plants that grow in very different conditions compared to wild plants. Nevertheless, loss in crop seed yield caused by any single pest is most often studied in isolation although crop plants are attacked by many pests that can cause substantial yield losses. This is especially important for crops able to compensate and even overcompensate for the damage. We investigated the interactive impacts on crop yield of four insect pests attacking different plant parts at different times during the cropping season. In 15 oilseed rape fields in Sweden, we estimated the damage caused by seed and <b>stem</b> <b>weevils,</b> pollen beetles, and pod midges. Pest pressure varied drastically among fields with very low correlation among pests, allowing us to explore interactive impacts on yield from attacks by multiple species. The plant damage caused by each pest species individually had, as expected, either no, or a negative impact on seed yield and the strongest negative effect was caused by pollen beetles. However, seed yield increased when plant damage caused by both seed and <b>stem</b> <b>weevils</b> was high, presumably due to the joint plant compensatory reaction to insect attack leading to overcompensation. Hence, attacks by several pests can change the impact on yield of individual pest species. Economic thresholds based on single species, on which pest management decisions currently rely, may therefore result in economically suboptimal choices being made and unnecessary excessive use of insecticides...|$|R

Several species of endophytic fungi, especially Acremonium spp., have also been studied with a view to biological control in New Zealand. Their presence inside the crop plant deters egg-laying by the weevil and reduces the damage done by the larvae, however Acremonium lolii renders perennial ryegrass toxic to livestock at some stages of growth, putting them at risk of developing the disease perennial ryegrass staggers.|$|R

50|$|Perennial {{ryegrass}} staggers {{is caused}} by the ingestion of grass that is infected by the endophyte fungus Epichloë festucae var lolli, and this fungus produces a variety of toxins such as peramine, a pyrrolopyrazine alkaloid, and lolitrem B, an indole-diterpene compound. There is no external sign when perennial ryegrass is infected by this fungus. The Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> (Listronotus bonariensis) feeds on perennial ryegrass. When the grass on which they are feeding is infected by the fungus, the larvae of the weevil fail to develop fully. In an effort to breed perennial ryegrass that was resistant to the weevil, researchers in New Zealand inadvertently selected strains that were susceptible to the fungus. In fact the endophytic fungus forms a mutualistic association with the grass which grows more vigorously as a result and produces more tillers. With greater use of these susceptible cultivars, the fungus which is present in the seed, spread more widely with a consequent increase in perennial ryegrass staggers.|$|R
40|$|In {{the study}} the author used a {{mechanical}} and an X-ray method for {{the determination of}} the strength properties of the <b>stems</b> of winter <b>rape</b> varieties. In a bending process, rigidity and maximum bending stress were determined. Also, were determined the static shearing energy and the dynamic shearing energy, and the shearing energy per unit of a stem cross section area, naturally as well as after the removal of the parenchyma, and density and the DOD parameter in order to define the amount of X-ray radiation energy absorbed by the stem. It was found that the character of the changes in the mechanical properties on the length of the stem is described by a square polynomial. The studies showed that the shearing energy from the static and dynamic tests are identical to {{the determination of the}} shearing energy of <b>rape</b> <b>stems.</b> High values of correlation coefficients between the shearing energy from the two test were obtained. It was found, on the basis of an analysis of results concerning the variability of the work required the shearing of a unit of the cross section area of <b>rape</b> <b>stems,</b> that is, a characteristic spot located close to the first branching of the plant. A significant relationship was shown to exist between the mechanical parameters of the stem and the amount of X-ray radiation energy absorbed by the stem. In this study, a close correlation was found between the mechanical properties of stems and the resistance of rape plants to lodging...|$|R

Males and females are equally attracted to this bait. Neither component alone showed any attractiveness. The presence of a pine <b>stem</b> for <b>weevil</b> feeding {{does not affect the}} number or sex ratio of captured weevils. The potential of using attraction to baited traps as a sampling method for pales weevil is discussed...|$|R

Endophytes in perennial ryegrass protect their hosts against attack by Argentine <b>stem</b> <b>weevil</b> but cause adverse affects, including heat stress, in grazing animals. Ten lambs were grazed on Grasslands Nui ryegrass without endophyte or with its wildtype or a high ergovaline-producing endophyte (196). Five lambs from the 196 treatment were swapped for 5 on the endophyte-free treatment after 20 days. Rectal temperatures and respiration rates were measured daily; on one day they were measured every 2 - 4 hours. There {{was a significant difference}} in respiration rate and body temperature between lambs grazing endophyte and endophyte free treatments but not between the two endophyte treatments. There was no interaction with ambient temperature within the range 12 - 30 °C. When lambs where transferred from toxic to non-toxic treatments there was no significant decrease in body temperature or respiration rate witbin 14 days. Ergovaline, even at low concentrations, affects thermo-regulation in lambs and is undesirable in perennial ryegrass endophyte associations...|$|R
