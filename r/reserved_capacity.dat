It is assumed that the gate closure time for submitting <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> bids is 1 hour before activation time. The <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> bids need to be formed so that activation of the capacity is always feasible, irrespective of the consumption of the portfolio before an activation request.

40|$|A dynamic {{scheduler}} {{that supports}} the coexistence of guaranteed and non-guaranteed bandwidth servers is proposed. Overloads are handled by an efficient reclaiming of residual capacities originated by early completions {{as well as by}} allowing <b>reserved</b> <b>capacity</b> stealing of non-guaranteed bandwidth servers. The proposed dynamic budget accounting mechanism ensures that at a particular time the currently executing server is using a residual capacity, its own capacity or is stealing some <b>reserved</b> <b>capacity,</b> eliminating the need of additional server states or unbounded queues. The server to which the budget accounting is going to be performed is dynamically determined at the time instant when a capacity is needed.

30|$|The {{results of}} the {{correlation}} analysis are summed up by the correlation map presented in Fig.  10, which represents the <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> of the links of the reduced BWFL model plotted against their WFEBC values. It emerges from the analysis of BWFL that the criticality measure <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> is biased; it sometimes falls short of identifying pipe failures leading to significant head losses if the supply of the critical node is not affected. As a result, <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> fails to assess the global impact of pipe failures on the network. On the other hand, WFEBC better reflects the relative contribution of alternative supply paths both to the global and local topological and energy redundancy of the network. The properties of the surrogate measure also make it an adequate pre-selection tool of critical links for further analysis, {{as illustrated by the}} flowchart in Fig.  11. Figure  10 shows that a fraction of pipes with <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> greater than 1 can be filtered out prior to the hydraulic CLA based on their WFEBC values (smaller than 1.17 approximately) with low chances of eliminating critical pipes in the process, as lower WFEBC values are systematically associated with high <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> values.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Decompressive {{laparotomy}} {{followed by}} temporary abdominal closure (TAC) is an established prophylaxis and treatment for abdominal compartment syndrome. The herein presented study {{aimed at the}} comparison of volume <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> and development of intra-abdominal hypertension after forced primary abdominal closure and different TAC techniques in a porcine model. METHODS: Eight anesthesized and mechanically ventilated domestic pigs underwent a standardized midline laparotomy. A bag was placed into the abdominal cavity. Before abdominal closure, the bag was prefilled with 3, 000 mL water to simulate increased intra-abdominal volume. The intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) was then increased in 2 mm Hg steps up to 30 mm Hg by adding volume (volume <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity)</b> to the intra-abdominal bag. Volume <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> with the corresponding IAP were analyzed and compared for primary abdominal closure, bag silo closure, a zipper system, and vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) with different negative pressures (- 50, - 100, and - 150 mm Hg). Hemodynamic and pulmonary parameters were monitored throughout the experiment. RESULTS: Volume <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> was the highest for bag silo closure followed by the zipper system and VAC with primary abdominal closure providing the least volume <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> in the whole IAP range. Of interest, VAC - 50 mm Hg resulted in a lower volume <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> when compared with VAC - 100 and - 150 mm Hg. Pulmonary and hemodynamic parameters demonstrated {{no significant differences between}} primary abdominal closure and the evaluated TAC techniques at all IAP levels. CONCLUSIONS: The present experimental in vivo study indicates that bag silo closure and zipper systems may be favorable TAC techniques after decompressive laparotomy. In contrast, the VAC techniques resulted in lower volume <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> and therefore may bear an increased risk for recurrent intra-abdominal hypertension in the initial phase after decompressive laparotomy...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} recognition that mitochondrial dysfunction {{is associated with}} the autism spectrum disorders. However, little attention has been given to the etiology of mitochondrial dysfunction or how mitochondrial abnormalities might interact with other physiological disturbances associated with autism, such as oxidative stress. In the current study we used respirometry to examine <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity,</b> a measure of the mitochondrial ability to respond to physiological stress, in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from children with autistic disorder (AD) as well as age and gender-matched control LCLs. We demonstrate, for the first time, that LCLs derived from children with AD have an abnormal mitochondrial <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> before and after exposure to increasingly higher concentrations of 2, 3 -dimethoxy- 1, 4 -napthoquinone (DMNQ), an agent that increases intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Specifically, the AD LCLs exhibit a higher <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> at baseline and a sharper depletion of <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> when ROS exposure is increased, as compared to control LCLs. Detailed investigation indicated that <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> abnormalities seen in AD LCLs were the result of higher ATP-linked respiration and maximal respiratory capacity at baseline combined with a marked increase in proton leak respiration as ROS was increased. We further demonstrate that these <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> abnormalities are driven by a subgroup of eight (32 %) of 25 AD LCLs. Additional investigation of this subgroup of AD LCLs with <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> abnormalities revealed that it demonstrated a greater reliance on glycolysis and on uncoupling protein 2 to regulate oxidative stress at the inner mitochondria membrane. This study suggests that a significant subgroup of AD children may have alterations in mitochondrial function which could render them more vulnerable to a pro-oxidant microenvironment derived from intrinsic and extrinsic sources of ROS such as immune activation and pro-oxidant environmental toxicants. These findings are consistent with the notion that AD is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors...|$|R
