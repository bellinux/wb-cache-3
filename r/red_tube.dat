500|$|Like other fantasy novels, the Septimus Heap {{series is}} set in an {{imaginary}} world. Maps are provided {{in all of the}} books. Magyk contains a map of the Castle and its surroundings to the Port in the south. An enlarged map of the Castle is also included. Flyte has a map showing the Badlands and the Borderlands in the north. Physik has an enlarged map of the Castle with more details showing the Alchemie chambers. Queste has a map for the House of Foryx, drawn by Snorri for Marcellus. Syren keeps the past maps but adds the isles of Syren. The map in Syren also mentions that the country that Septimus lives in is called [...] "The Small Wet Country Across the Sea". Darke has a map similar to that in Magyk, however, instead of including Marram Marshes which are south of the castle, it includes a map of the Darke Halls, bleak creek and the bottomless whirlpool. It also includes an enlarged map of the castle. At the end of Fyre, Septimus writes in the snow that the date is [...] 4 July 12,004. The book ends with a quote from Arthur C Clarke: [...] "Any Sufficiently Advanced Technology is Indistinguishable from Magyk"., hinting that the series {{is set in}} the far future. This also hinted at by a dialogue between Lucy Gringe and Wolf Boy in Syren about the <b>Red</b> <b>Tube.</b> Wolf Boy says he has heard stories that people used to travel to the moon in things like that. Lucy dismisses this, however, it's apparent they are talking about Apollo moon missions. [...] Hints that the story is set in the future also reveal themselves when Septimus and the possessed Syrah enter a chamber that goes up and down with the press of a button, indicating that they used an elevator.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this study, the Taguchi method, a {{powerful}} tool to design optimization for quality, is used to find the optimal cutting parameters for turning operations. An orthogonal array, the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio, is employed to investigate the cutting characteristics of <b>red</b> copper <b>tube</b> using high speed steel W 18 Cr 4 V cutting tools. Three cutting parameters namely, cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut, are optimized with considerations of micro groove fin quality. The experimental results show that best micro groove quality {{can be obtained by}} selecting the appropriate cutting parameters for the inner <b>red</b> copper <b>tube.</b> The experimental results also show that there is a definite significance to guide how to choose cutting parameters for P-E forming...|$|R

The <b>red</b> <b>tubes</b> in the background represent the internal HiPPI network and the FDDI rings which connect PDC to SUNET and the world. The rendering model was developed by Johan Ihrén, using the ray tracing program rayshade. On the screen there is a snapshot of a numerical simulation of an E-shaped waveguide transmitting electromagnetic waves. The calculations are performed by solving Maxwells equations with finite differences in time domain. The antenna current is shown on the antenna, surface currents on the waveguide surface and energy density (log scale) in the field, projected on the three outer artificial surfaces. Calculations have been done by Gunnar Ledfelt, see Section 4. 1 on page 35 for more details. (Copyright c ○ 1996 Center for Parallel Computers. ...|$|R

The original [...] "vermillion vitreous porcelain edged sign with a double row of red neon tubes" [...] was replaced with solely <b>red</b> <b>tubes.</b> Around four thousand feet of neon tubing was used in the renovation. The sign can be seen from almost 75 miles away from the air at night and 20 miles away on a clear day.After renovation in 2016 due to wind damage, the sign was relit, with a color changing LED sign. For the Winter Carnival in 2017, the sign changed color from neon red to icy blue. [...] In 2017, the signed was changed to purple, during the first anniversary of musician Prince's death.|$|R
