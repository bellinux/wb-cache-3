2500|$|After the Revolution, {{the members}} of the Livingston family whose ancestral estate were the portion of the Hudson's eastern shore now the Hudson River Historic District, a National Historic Landmark (NHL), {{continued}} to enjoy the semi-feudal landownership they had broken with the Crown to protect. They made sure their estate houses, like Clermont Manor and Montgomery Place, both also NHLs, provided ample views of the Escarpment across the <b>river,</b> <b>lands</b> which the family had started to acquire. [...] "The view to be had from these houses became of the very first importance," [...] according to Catskill historian Alf Evers. [...] "... man looking toward the Catskills from the east bank could see a view the equal in almost every respect to the already famous ones admired by so many tourists to England's Lake District." [...] Horatio Spafford voiced a similar opinion at the time. [...] " [...] associate a mass of interesting, picturesque and sublime objects, no where exceeded in this country", he wrote in his 1813 gazetteer of the state. Later on, they followed the principles of Andrew Jackson Downing in designing their landscapes to provide views from its roads and paths. Even after the Livingstons moved on to other regions of the country, their reputation made the Catskills known in Britain as well as the U.S.|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the environment of}} <b>river</b> <b>land,</b> butterfly community was monitored by a transect-count method at a <b>land</b> of Katsura <b>river</b> located in Kyoto city in 1997. Eight families, 30 species and 580 individuals were observed. Species most observed was Pieris rapae, which occupied 45. 8 % of the butterfly community. Although Morishita's diversity index (β index) of the community in the <b>river</b> <b>land</b> was {{lower than those of}} several residential suburbs in Kansai area, Sunose's EI index of the community in the <b>river</b> <b>land</b> was higher than those of the residential suburbs. Pianka's α indices showed that the degree of overlap among the butterfly communities in the <b>river</b> <b>land</b> and the residential suburbs was high. These results indicate that butterfly community of a <b>river</b> <b>land</b> does not quantitatively but qualitatively differ from that of a residential suburb near the <b>river</b> <b>land.</b> 報文日本学術振興会科学研究費(基盤研究 (C),·No. 12680534...|$|R
