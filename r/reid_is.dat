500|$|Following {{the release}} of Rainbow, Carey left Sony and signed an $80 million, four-album {{contract}} with EMI's Virgin Records, wishing to severe all ties with Sony and its chairman, her former husband Tommy Mottola. Halperin and Hampp believe that following a prolonged period of absence from Sony and re-signing with them is a positive situation for Carey: [...] "Doug Morris, current chairman/CEO of Sony Music, brought Carey to Island Def Jam in 2003 {{when he was running}} Universal Music Group. Reid, then head of Island Def Jam, oversaw her Mimi-powered 2005 comeback. Joey Arbagey, a collaborator of Carey's during the making of the six-times platinum The Emancipation of Mimi, is now executive vp A at Epic." [...] Furthermore, Carey released seven studio albums, a live EP and four compilation/greatest hits albums with Sony, which have sold a total of 54 million units in the US combined. Although Halperin and Hampp note that [...] "Carey's legacy is undisputed, her recent stumbles have not gone unnoticed," [...] with regard to her divorce from Nick Cannon, the low sales of Me. I Am Mariah… The Elusive Chanteuse and its failure to garner a top-ten single on the Billboard Hot 100 and hiring and firing three managers: Dupri, Randy Jackson and Kevin Giles (the last of whom Carey has kept as a consultant). As a result, several record labels were reluctant to offer Carey a contract.
