40|$|This chapter {{investigates the}} legal and ethical {{framework}} for content marketing. The use of content marketing necessitates special considerations due to its legal implications for the marketer. In addition, legal rules should be interpreted in accordance with ethical standards for advertising and marketing communication practice. The general provision that all marketing should be designed and presented {{in such a way}} that its marketing purpose is clear, serves as a starting point for this legal analysis. As surreptitious advertising is prohibited, the marketer must identify advertising as such. Furthermore, principal <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>marketing</b> practice also apply to content marketing. Thus, legal and ethical analyses include discussions regarding good marketing practice, misleading and unfair advertising, special concerns regarding content marketing directed toward children, evidential rules and law enforcemen...|$|E
40|$|Citrus fruits {{destined to}} the fresh market {{are subject to}} several {{treatments}} in packing lines {{with the aim of}} lengthen shelf-life, increase commercial value, and comply with the <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>marketing.</b> During the treatments, fruits collide {{with each other and with}} components of the machines and undergo mechanical damage that can be very serious. Therefore, operators make changes to the machines in order to reduce number and intensity of impacts. This paper reports the results of a study on the impacts suffered by oranges during packing operations, carried out by using an instrumented sphere IS 100. Experimental measurements were conducted in a packing house equipped with two packing lines, where they were both traditional and innovative machines (regarding the empting and the filling of the bins, the release of the fruits from the sizing machines, the transfer of the fruits between belt conveyors), specifically designed to reduce the mechanical impacts to the fruits. The results showed that the innovations were effective in reducing the intensity of the impacts, expressed in terms of acceleration. The maximum acceleration was always lower (from 47 to 83 %) with respect to the conventional machines, whereas the average number of impacts per replicate was lower in the sizing machines (- 6 %) and during the emptying of the bins (- 36 %), but was higher during the transfer of the oranges between belt conveyors (+ 33 %) and during the filling of the bins (+ 73 %). The increase in the average number of impacts depends from the fact that the innovative systems "accompany" the fruits towards the exit, causing a greater number of impacts of lower intensity...|$|E

40|$|Current <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>market</b> {{manipulation}} {{ignore the}} existing and rapidly {{growing body of}} scholarship on how securities prices are formed in markets. These rules are primarily reactive, and depend on vague and difficult measures such as the “artificiality ” of a resulting market price or the trader’s intention. Some trades, like matched and wash sales, have indeed been singled out since the 1930 ’s for special scrutiny, but this list has never been updated. Through even a cursory {{review of existing literature}} in financial economics and market microstructure, lawmakers and regulators would be able to know the times, the market conditions, and the types of securities that facilitate and give greatest incentive for trade-based market manipulation, as well as the manipulative techniques best adapted to each, specific situation. Rapid advance in the technological prowess of some institutional traders has lent urgency to the task of updating <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>market</b> manipulation. The playing field between high-powered and retail traders has become so uneven that soon our original understanding of securities markets will be eclipsed.

They find this effect to be large and significant, ranging between 80 to 180 basis points. We argue that their methodology is inadequate and that their estimates are biased. The reason is that Empire subjection did not affect borrowing conditions at the margin, as they assume, but structurally.

40|$|This paper uses data {{on health}} {{insurance}} choices by employees of Harvard University {{to examine the}} effect of alternative pricing <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>market</b> equilibrium. In the mid- 1990 s, Harvard moved from a system of subsidizing more expensive insurance to a system of contributing an equal amount to each plan. We estimate a substantial demand response to the policy change, with a short-run elasticity of about - 2. The reform also induced substantial" adverse selection. Because of this selection, the long-run demand response is three times the short-run response. Price variation induced by adverse selection is inefficient; we estimate the magnitude of the welfare loss from adverse selection at 2 percent of baseline health spending. Finally, as insurance choice was made more competitive, premiums to Harvard fell relative to premiums in the Boston area by nearly 10 percent. This savings was large enough to compensate for the inefficiency induced by adverse selection, so that reform overall was welfare enhancing. ...|$|R

40|$|Updated May 2012 and reposted: In 2011, an EU {{legislative}} package <b>on</b> <b>market</b> abuse was proposed, which comprises {{two sets of}} documents: 1) a draft Regulation that will largely replace the existing Market Abuse Directive (MAD) and the level 2 measures; and a new Directive dealing with criminal sanctions. Market abuse rules are needed to ensure market integrity and investor confidence, and to allow companies to raise capital and contribute to economic growth, thereby increasing employment. This ECMI Policy Brief argues that <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>market</b> abuse should be technically well designed, proportionate and crystal clear, but also subject to more efficient and harmonised supervision than before. The paper focuses particularly on the draft Regulation. The use of a regulation is welcome, as (in integrated financial markets) abuses should be regulated in a harmonised manner by member states, which {{has not always been}} the case, as the 2007 report from the European Securities Markets Expert (ESME) Group extensively demonstrated. At the same time, this paper criticises some of the provisions contained in the draft Regulation, notably the new notion of inside information not to abuse (Art. 6 (e)) and the unchanged definition of inside information for listed companies to disclose, and it proposes new definitions. The extension of disclosure obligations to issuers whose shares are traded on demand only on ‘listing’ multilateral trading facilities is also widely criticised.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} setting of {{monetary}} and nonmonetary policies in monetary unions. We show that in these unions a time inconsistency problem in monetary policy leads to a novel type of free- rider problem in {{the setting of}} nonmonetary policies, such as labor market policy, fiscal policy, and bank regulation. The free-rider problem leads the union's members to pursue lax nonmonetary policies that induce the monetary authority to generate high inflation. The free-rider problem can be mitigated by imposing constraints on the nonmonetary policies, like unionwide <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> labor <b>market</b> policy, debt constraints on members' fiscal policy, and unionwide regulation of banks. When there is no time inconsistency problem, there is no free-rider problem, and constraints on nonmonetary policies are unnecessary and possibly harmful. ...|$|R

40|$|Motivated by {{deregulation}} {{in major}} service sectors like airlines, banking and telecommunication, the electric industry {{is undergoing a}} major transformation. However due to design inefficiencies, restructuring of the power sector, so far, {{has not been a}} major success. A lack of comprehensive quantitative models has resulted in the inability of the market designers to evaluate market performance and develop successful market designs. A comprehensive model should include market features like two-settlement system, transmission congestion, financial transmission rights (FTRs), demand elasticity, demand-side bidding and other market rules. The contribution of this thesis includes development of an exhaustive modeling framework that includes the above mentioned market features and also development of a computationally effective solution methodology. The market designers would use this methodology in the development of alternative conceptual market design frameworks, and also for assessing the impact of various <b>market</b> <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>market</b> performance. The noncooperative bidding behavior of the generators in both FTR and energy markets are modeled as nonzero-sum stochastic games. Since the bidding strategies in the FTR and energy games are dependent on each other and jointly impact the market performance, a two-tier learning approach is developed. Players (e. g. generators) first bid in the FTR market. FTR bids are then taken into account in the process of selecting bids in the energy market. The FTR bids and the energy bids together decide the market equilibrium and the resulting performance. This performance measure is then used to evaluate success of FTR bidding strategy. Several example power networks are studied to expose the modeling and learning based solution approach...|$|R

40|$|Electricity {{systems are}} a central {{component}} of modern economies. Many electricity markets are transitioning from centrally regulated systems to decentralized markets. Furthermore, several electricity markets that have recently undergone this transition have exhibited extremely unsatisfactory results, {{most notably in}} California. These high stakes transformations require the introduction of largely untested regulatory structures. Suitable tools {{that can be used}} to test these regulatory structures before they are applied to real systems are required. Multi-agent models can provide such tools. To better understand the requirements such as tool, a live electricity market simulation was created.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to investigate the impact of different pricing <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> the economic performance of a deregulated electricity market. In particular, the influence on the bid prices and profits of generators, total dispatch cost, and the volatility of these values will be examined. Given the debate, over the past two decades, regarding the selection of the best pricing rules, the applicability of the Revenue Equivalence Theorem in the deregulated electricity market is revisited in this research. This theorem has been adopted in the literature as a theoretical support for deciding pricing rule in the market settlement process. In this research, it is hypothesized that the Revenue Equivalence Theorem may not hold. Therefore, it is appropriate to analyze market performance when different pricing rules are imposed to govern the market. Furthermore, this research also highlights the importance of generators bidding strategies in the competitive electricity market. The different methods used to design generators bidding strategies as presented in the literature have been reviewed. In order to investigate the different impact of pricing <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>market</b> performance, this research employs a computer simulation method. A simulation platform is used to imitate the business activities in the electricity auction market, mainly in relation to the bidding, scheduling and dispatching processes. An agent-based approach is adopted for this purpose. The competing generators in the electricity market are modeled as agents. Bid stacking is used to model the optimization process of the Independent System Operator. The generator agents bidding strategies are designed using the Q-Learning algorithm. A Q-Learning-driven generator agent enables it to actively learn from the historical and market information leading to more realistic and practical results. Different pricing rules under both maximum quantity bidding and variable quantity bidding are studied separately. The influence on the bid prices and profits of generators, total dispatch cost, and the volatility of these values are analyzed accordingly...|$|R
