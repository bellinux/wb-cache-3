40|$|This {{research}} studies the acquisition and disposition of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>assets</b> by non-real <b>estate</b> firms from 1981 through 1986. Contrary to {{previous studies of}} <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>assets,</b> we find no abnormal performance associated with the buyers of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>assets</b> and only weak evidence of excess returns for sellers. When combining our results with previous work, we conclude that <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>assets</b> themselves offer the market no unique opportunity to earn excess return. However, it appears that selected organizational forms may be preferred for managing some <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>assets.</b> Thus, when the acquisition or disposition of a realty asset has {{no change in the}} management structure of the assets, as in this study, no excess return is found. Our study is limited by the relatively small number of sellers available for analysis. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{long-term}} relationship between the rate of inflation and the returns of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> and financial <b>assets</b> traded in New Zealand markets. Design/methodology/approach – The question of whether these assets are good candidates to hedge inflation in the long run is addressed employing cointegration and causality tests on quarterly data for the period from December 1979 to December 2003. Findings – A strong long-term relationship was found between the returns offered by all types of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>assets</b> (i. e. residential, commercial, industrial and farm building) and the rate of inflation. However, such a long run relationship is not detected between the rate of inflation and the returns of financial assets (i. e. stocks, short-term bills and long-term bonds). Research limitations/implications – The empirical findings reveal that the direction of causality is from inflation to <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>assets</b> indicating that changes in property prices do not cause inflation in New Zealand; the cause of inflation is independent of the price movements for <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>assets.</b> The <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>assets</b> are found to offer an effective hedge against inflation in the long run. The same cannot be said for the financial assets, however. Originality/value – This is the first New Zealand study which investigates the long-term inflation hedging effectiveness of both <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> and financial <b>assets.</b> The findings should be of interest to most of the investors in New Zealand as the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>assets</b> play a significant role in their portfolio decisions.
