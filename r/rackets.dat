40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effects of two different <b>racket</b> models and two different forehand drive velocities on the three-dimensional vibration behavior of the <b>racket</b> and shock transmission to the player’s wrist under real playing conditions. Nine tennis players performed a series of crosscourt flat forehand drives at two velocities, using a lightly and a highly vibrant <b>racket.</b> Two accelerometers were fixed on the <b>racket</b> frame and the player’s wrist. The analysis of vibration signals in both time and frequency domains showed no inter-action effect of velocity and <b>racket</b> conditions either on the <b>racket</b> vibration behavior or on shock transmission. An increase in playing velocity enlarged the amount of vibrations at the <b>racket</b> and wrist, but weakly altered their frequency content. As compared to a <b>racket</b> per-ceived as highly vibrating, a <b>racket</b> perceived as lightly vibrating damped longer in the out-of-plane axis of the <b>racket</b> and shorter on the other axis of the <b>racket</b> and on the wrist, and displayed a lower amount {{of energy in the}} high frequency of the vibration signal at the <b>racket</b> and wrist. These findings indicated that the playing velocity must be controlled when investigating the vibration loads due to the <b>racket</b> under real playing conditions. Similarly, a reduced perception of vibration by the tennis player would be linked to decreased ampli-tude of the <b>racket</b> vibration signal, which may concentrate the signal energy in the low frequencies...|$|R

Spencer Gore, a 27-year-old <b>rackets</b> player from Wandsworth and at the time a land agent and surveyor by profession, won his first round match against Henry Thomas Gillson in straight sets. The five second-round matches were played on Tuesday, 10 July, again in fine weather. Charles Gilbert Heathcote had a bye in the second round. J.

Traditionally, sport for boys used to be split between the original 'major sports' of football, cricket, and <b>rackets</b> (rugby was added later), and 'minor sports'. Colours were awarded for each major sport, as appropriate. After 1995, the distinction between 'major sport' and 'minor sport' was removed. The girls' main sports are hockey and lacrosse in the winter, lacrosse and netball in the Lent Term and tennis and rounders in the summer.|$|E

5|$|At {{the urging}} of Butler's father, in 1924, the newly elected mayor of Philadelphia W.

Philadelphia's municipal government was notoriously corrupt and Butler initially refused. Kendrick asked President Calvin Coolidge to intervene. Coolidge contacted Butler and authorized him to take the necessary leave from the Corps. At the request of the president, Butler served in the post from January 1924 until December 1925. He began his new job by assembling all 4,000 of the city police into the Metropolitan Opera House in shifts to introduce himself and inform them that things would change while he was in charge.

The posts, nets and hand-stitched, flannel-covered India-rubber balls for the tournament were supplied by Jefferies & Co from Woolwich, while the <b>rackets</b> used were an adaptation of those used in real tennis, with a small and slightly lopsided head. The ball-boys kept the tennis balls, 180 of which were used during the tournament, in canvas wells.

5|$|Jardine entered New College, Oxford, in September 1919 at a {{time when}} the {{university}} was more crowded than usual due to the arrival of men whose entrance had been delayed due to the war. He took part in several sports, representing New College as goalkeeper in matches between the colleges, and being given a trial for the University football team, although he was not chosen. He continued to play <b>rackets</b> and began to play real tennis, making such progress and showing such promise that he went on to represent the University successfully and won his Blue. In cricket, Jardine came under the coaching of Tom Hayward who influenced his footwork and defence. Wisden commented in 1928 that Jardine had come with an excellent reputation, but did not quite achieve the success which was expected. His batting ability, particularly defensively, remained unquestioned.|$|E
