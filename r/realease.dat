40|$|Neuropeptides {{comprise}} {{a class of}} structural diverse messenger molecules {{that occur in the}} whole animal kingdom where they play many roles in the regulation of physiological processes and behaviour by binding to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Two important classes of neuropeptides in insects are CAPA peptides (orthologues of Drosophila melanogaster peptides encoded on the gene capability), which cause myotropic effects or (anti-) diuretic effects, and adipokinetic homones (AKH), which are involved in energy mobilisation during flight. A BLAST search of these insect CAPA and AKH receptors in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome revealed potential nematode orthologues for both of them. Both C. elegans receptor encoding genes were expressed in mammalian cells which were screened against synthetic C. elegans peptides and HPLC fractions of a C. elegans peptide extract in order to find the corresponding ligands. This way, the putative GPCRs were deorphanized by means of a reversed pharmacological approach. Not only do the CAPA and AKH receptors from insects show remarkable sequence resemblance with their counterparts in the nematode C. elegans, their activating peptide ligands also display similar motifs. Moreover, the insect and nematode AKH receptors are related to the mammalian gonadotropin <b>realeasing</b> hormone receptor. Taken all together, this points to co-evolution of neuropeptides and their receptors in arthropods and nematodes, as well as in mammals, at least at the structural level. Conservation of the physiological functions of these peptides and receptors, however, remains to be investigated. status: publishe...|$|R

Well known examples are fair comparison of R+D results, acceptance tests for the procurement of HPC systems, {{and the creation of}} miniapps to better understand how to port real applications to current and future supercomputers. As a result of these efforts there is a variety of public benchmark suites available to the HPC community, e. g., Linpack, NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB), CORAL benchmarks, and Unified European Application Benchmark Suite. The upcoming next generation of supercomputers is now leading to create new miniapps to evaluate the potential performance of different programming models on mission critical applications, such as the XRayTrace miniapp under development at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This paper presents the technological roadmap of Parallware, a new suite of tools for high-productivity HPC education and training, that also facilitates the porting of HPC applications.

Peptides {{of this family}} are generally carboxyterminally amidated octa-, nona- or decapeptides with a pyroglutamate residue at the aminoterminus. In insects, AKHs signal through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) related to the mammalian gonadotropin <b>realeasing</b> hormone receptor (GnRHR). This was first reported in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the silkworm Bombyx mori. Recently, a putative gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor orthologue (Ce-GnRHR) could be identified in C. elegans. This GPCR is localized in the germline, intestine and pharynx, but the endogenous ligand of this receptor remained unknown, Ce-GnRHR – expressed in mammalian cells – was first screened against synthetic D. melanogaster AKH in order to confirm that this receptor is indeed the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor orthologue in C. elegans. Because no AKH-like peptide {{has been found in}} C. elegans so far, we performed a specific pattern-based bio-informatic search. This revealed one clear new neuropeptide precursor gene that has been overlooked in former in silico studies. Synthetic replicates of the contained Ce_AKH were tested in our cellular assay to deorphanize the Ce-GnRHR. A NemaBLAST search with the C. elegans AKH precursor as a query revealed two very similar sequences, from the hookworm Necator americanus and the intestinal parasite in sheep and goats Haemonchus contortus. Both parasitic AKHs are also able to activate Ce-GnRHR in a dose-responsive way. RNAi experiments indicate that Ce-GnRHR is involved in the egg laying process. These observations are completely in line with the crucial role of GnRH in reproduction in vertebrates.

I tried to find answers to the following questions: which role a press release has for a journalist, which is {{the practice of the}} usage of press releases and which is a good press release for a journalist. Research showed that even though journalist use more press releases than originally thought, they don’t take these as their main sources of information. Regional papers’ editors and reporters prefer their regular sources who tend to be regular people, friends and family or specialists working in a field of journalist’s subject field. Mainly press releases are used as backround information, for educational purposes or for finding a theme for a longer story. Journalists receive a different amount of press releases. There is a tendency for a newspaper’s general e-mail to receive more press releases than journalist’s personal work e-mail. Number of the received press releases is between 10 and 150. Relying on the journalists’ personal preferences only maximum 5 of these are used. This means that the average usage of press releases for the interviewed journalists is only nearly 7, 5 %. Journalists say that most of the received press <b>realeases</b> are good and well-structured, but they are not being used nevertheless. Most common reasons not to use the press release tend to be it’s subject not being close enough to the reader, impossibility to focus the story to the region, or release being too much of an advert to use as a piece of news. Press release’s sender is not important fot the interviewed journalists. Their opinions differ in a question weather a press release should include someones commentary and photos. Ladder are considered importand when there is not much time until the deadline or the article is meant for the online paper. All journalists find it important that the press release is geographically or emotionally close to the reader and it fills the criteria of news values. Backround information in the press releases is usually considered unnecessary – first hand it should be short and concrete, while the most important information should be placed in the beginning of a release and less important should come towards the end.

40|$|The essay {{presents}} the author’s observations about the ingression of Tuvan music into the World Music – a niche of world musical culture covering ethnical music traditions. The author has witnessed {{the rise of}} interest to traditional musical culture of Tuva and Russia as well as globalization of Tuvan music. He is endeavoring to interpret these changes and reveal their affect on traditional music and xöömei. In the late Soviet period, traditional music in Tuva, like in many republics of the Union, has been as if put on hold. During the Perestroika and national revival processes, traditionalism became of high demand. Symposia and festivals started off in Tuva where amateur participants took the same stage with professionals. Special honor was paid to old masters of xöömei. Scholars started engaging in  discussions about the origins and a role of xöömei and its genres. Хöömei attracted {{a good deal of}} market interest from outside Russia. In the late 1980 s American scientist and producer T. Levin made first field records of xöömei to be released on a disk. Ethnographic ensemble “Tuva” was established. Later, members of “Tuva” started their own musical bands. Musical programs were compiled as an ethnographic variety show – a principle that the public has been seeking for both in Tuva and abroad. Disks were <b>realeased</b> and artists started active touring in foreign countries. Boosting interest in World Music was marked with hallmark attention to the phenomenon of throat-singing and overtone music, and further evolution of Tuvan music has since been tightly linked to Western musical market. The author traces the peculiarities of such bands as “Huun Huur Tu”, “Yat-Kha”, etc. and remarks that the value of Tuvan music is not only in star performers shining on the Western skies, but in the rise of a stable community of people inspired by Tuvan music and culture, and seeking new ways of aesthetic and spiritual perception of the world. Tuva now has its rock, as well as avant-garde, women bands, etc. Throat-singing became a popular type of vocal arts. Tuvan music attracts hundreds of thousands of fans around the world. Circulation of media, especially with Tuvan music, allowed musicians of Sayan-Altai region and Central Asia to rediscover many of their own genres. Thus, Tuvan music burst into the world like a Mongol invasion in early 1990 s. Global success of Tuvan music on the world music market is obvious. But the process of normalization of Tuvan music perception by the outer world is inevitable.   This article has audio files attached (please, see "Supplementary files" in "Article tools") ...|$|R

The differences {{was due to the}} incident differently conceived and constructed by the media. While {{the purpose of this study}} was to determine the frame created every local media online by Tribunnews, Jawapos and Suara Merdeka with the Ganjar Pranowo 2 ̆ 7 s <b>realease</b> in E-KTP before and after corruption case researched. The total source of this research are 36 news of each 12 news in three medias: before the E-KTP case in August to November 2015 and after the E-KTP case in March 2017. The methods used of this research is the analysis of framing, used to see how the massages or events are constructed by the media and presented to the audience, by developing analytical framing of Zhongdang Pan and Gerald M. Kosicki (2007). This model devides the framing in four major structures, they are syntactic, script, thematic,and rhetorical. The results of this study indicate that the news in Tribunnes, Jawa Pos, and Suara Merdeka in the incident leading to the same goal which is to compare Ganjar Pranowo 2 ̆ 7 s release before and after E-KTP corruption case. The result of framing analysis on Tribunnews that have change of attitude from take side to the blaming Ganjar Pranowo as E-KTP corruption case. It 2 ̆ 7 s highlited on the selection of news sources. In contrast with Jawa Pos, it show that have take sides (in another word “pro”) and It 2 ̆ 7 s highlited on the selection of vocabulary to the positive attitude. The results of framing analysis from Suara Merdeka on Ganjar news that there is no change in attitude found. Suara Merdeka is very neutral and impartial to anyone, but have the sensationalism in the news Ganjar Pranowo. Sensationalism can be measured on the emotional aspect (likes, hates, sad, happy, disappointed, tired, etc. ...|$|E
40|$|There are so {{many public}} {{officials}} in Indonesia who have been entrapped {{in the case of}} corruption, collusion, and nepotism. Most of them comes from executive, judicial, and legislative parties. Ironically, the institution appointed by the government to monitor the corruption cases are captured in the same case. This indirectly shows the eakening of act No. 28 of 1999 concerning State Official who are free from Corruption, Collusion, and Nepotism. Besides, it also shows the social life values that are no longer in order. Corruption is one of the illness occurred in the New Order. It results economic, politic, power, and bureaucracy system that is relation/family-based. During New Order (32 years), public morality has been felt by dominant political interest. State through government has created a stigma and deviant behavior (abuse of power) by legalizing the corruption practice among official. As a result, corruption {{has been a lot of}} done by authorities and its cronies in this era. In Reformation Era, an effort to eliminate corruption is signed by the formation of various legislation product and Corruption Eradication Commision (KPK). Corruption, however, is not only a legal issue, but also culture, customs, chance, moral, and religious issue. Therefore, eradication effort cannot only be limited in the judicial fulfillment. In the application, Act No. 28 of 1999 has not been effectively implemented. This law disorder is caused by social disorder. Legal issues, however, cannot be separated from social life. Besides, there is an assumption that the main problem of corruption deals with the society mindset in fulfilling the economic needs. The changing of behavior pattern that is in accordance to the values of justice, religion, and ethic will be more effective than the application of acts only. Corruption cannot be solved only by government or an institution. In egalitarian structure, society has an access to control the authority. In this case, strong institutions of law enforcement officials and honest law enforcement (fair trial) are needed, especially among Criminal Justice System (CJS) that becomes the basis of corruption eradication. Moreover, law apparatus also should be fair, objective and impartial. They should not select the case based on their interest (equality of law). In line wih the demand of reformation, People’s Consultative Assembly (Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat, MPR) of Indonesia <b>realeases</b> the decree No. XI/MPR/ 1998 concerning country that is clear and free from corruption, collusion, and nepotism. MPR also makes the decree No. VI/MPR/ 2001 regarding the Ethical Life of a Nation. These decrees become the basis to catch the corruption. It even strengthens by the decree No VIII/MPR/ 2001 relating to the Recommendation of Corruption, Collusion, and Nepotism Eradication and Prevention Policy. Meanwhile, to optimize the corruption eradication, Corruption Eradication Commision is formed. Unfortunately, the implementation spirit does not fully support the aims of law enforcement. Most of the public does not trust the seriousness of states organizer in building authorative and clean governance. Relating this, government along with society should restore the public trust to the state officials in eforcing the rule of law...|$|R

40|$|In Indonesia, cassava is used {{mostly for}} human consumption, while a smaller part {{is used for}} animal feed and as raw {{material}} in industry. This crop is cultivated in almost all provinces of Indonesia. However, because the amount of rainfall among the regions varies and is not evenly distributed, some regions have a wet climate while others have a dry climate. The type of climate affects the suitability of a particular variety and its productivity. The area planted to cassava in Indonesia is about 1. 3 million ha producing approximately 16. 3 million tons fresh cassava roots; {{this means that the}} average production per hectare is still low at about 12. 2 t/ha. This low yield is due to the use of local varieties, traditional cropping patterns and simple cultural practices. According to the government, cassava production is projected to increase to about 16. 5 million tons in the year 2000. This production can be achieved by intensifying the cultural practices {{as well as by the}} use of higher yielding cassava varieties, either sweet or bitter ones. Up to now, a very limited number of high yielding varieties have been released, i. e. only ten new varieties from 1969 to 1990 for all cassava areas in Indonesia, compared to 74 rice, 28 maize, 25 soybean, and 5 sweet potato varieties. Some new cassava varieties were released, such as Adira 1 (sweet) and Adira 2 (bitter) in 1978, and Adira 4 (bitter) in 1986. In 1993 MARIF (Malang Research Institute for Food Crops) released two new varieties named Malang 1 (CM 4049 - 2) and Malang 2 (CM 4031 - 10). Since 1984, Brawijaya University, in cooperation with CIAT, has been conducting cassava breeding. From F, cassava seed that had been provided, four promising clones were selected, i. e. UB 1 / 2 (CM 3962 - 2), UB 15 / 10 (CM 3380 - 10), UB 881 - 5 (SM 881 - 5) and UB 477 - 2 (SM 477 - 2). Multi-location trials have been conducted several times with these clones, especially in East Java. Concerning governmental regulations about the <b>realease</b> of new varieties, one must conduct multilocational trials of these promising lines or clones in at least five provinces. In 1995, those promising cassava clones were planted in East Java, Central Java, Lampung, North Sulawesi and Lombok. The result of these trials could suggest the release of these lines as new cassava varieties. From the results it was concluded that clones UB 1 / 2 and UB 15 / 10 (both bitter) are more suitable for regions with a wet climate, while clones UB 881 - 5 (bitter) and UB 477 - 2 (sweet) are more suitable for those with a dry climate...|$|E
