The company’s fleet is expanding with frequent new Mobile Offshore Drilling Units (MODU) and this might involve challenges with keeping up operations excellence from the first day. In this thesis the main object is to perform operation efficiency analyzes across three of Seadrill’s semisubmersible rigs; West Venture, West Phoenix and West Eminence. The chosen operations for analyses are: · Unrestricted tripping of drillpipe in cased hole · Unrestricted <b>running</b> <b>of</b> <b>casing</b> into the well · Running and pulling BOP The analyses were based on Daily Operations Database Application (DODA) reports, which is Seadrill’s daily operation reporting system. The reports contain specified amount of hours spent to perform the operation and the tripping distance, and tripping rates were determined and compared with the rigs. In the BOP operations the analyses emphasizes in addition on operation efficiency when placing BOP on wellhead and unlatch BOP from wellhead including the related operations. The well data are based on exploration wells, except from the first analysis which contain operations from other wells...|$|E
40|$|Oil well {{drilling}} operation {{is the subject}} of many activities, and for each part of its works and activities there is a particular tender for time schedule, quality and cost. I want to go back over an event which began in 2009 and finished 15 months later after continuous operation; the Bazian exploration oil well, Bn- 1. As far as I am concerned, the most important point that I want to convey is the relation between the three main points above, giving attention to these aspects and asking some questions in this regard, which will be easy for me to answer because I was working there and I was a part of those operations. New technology, a professional team, logistic support, security, skilled staff and team work were all main elements hidden within the above-mentioned main activities. The aforementioned uses only a normal <b>running</b> <b>of</b> <b>casing</b> pipes, and these operations will normally take one day, but in the Bazian Bn- 1 exploration oil well the time taken was more than one month. In this paper I want to make a very quick review of most of the operations performed for running 9 - 5 / 8 ” casing for the interval from 1195 m to 2028 m, which will clearly show that after three attempts {{we were not able to}} run the casing 100 % as planned, and I will provide a technical recommendation for future operations in a similar situation...|$|E
40|$|A concept {{review of}} {{concentric}} coiled tubing drilling (CTD) system is performed in this Master thesis, hereafter named DualCTD. The main {{purpose is to}} investigate and present the advantages, limitations and applications for the DualCTD system. A feasibility study {{has been carried out}} for subsea drilling of drainage holes from an existing well, and drilling of subsea production wells in the Barents Sea. The DualCTD system consists of two concentric coiled tubing (CT) strings that form a separate circulation system for the drilling fluid. Drilling fluid is pumped down the annulus between the two CT strings to the bottom hole assembly (BHA) where a mud motor generates rotation of the drill bit. The drilling fluid cleans the bit for cuttings and transports the cuttings through a circulating sub/dual float valve and into the inner string. This separated circulating system provides effective hole cleaning {{from the bottom of the}} well. The drilling fluid can be a light fluid, that is optimized for hole cleaning capabilities. A secondary annulus, formed between the DualCTD string and the borehole, is filled with a barrier fluid (BF). Viscous BF is used to separate the two fluid systems in the secondary annulus. Placing the BF in the secondary annuls below seafloor results in an optimized stabilized hydrostatic head. The BF can also be optimized for formation preserving properties. A choke valve in the return fluid line is used to control the back pressure and match the downhole pressure for the two fluid systems with the formation pressure. A light drilling fluid and a heavy BF will also increase the buoyancy of the DualCTD string. Buckling calculations conducted show that longer horizontal sections could be drilled due to increased buckling resistance and reduced friction drag for the buoyant DualCTD string. Horizontal sections of up to 2300 m can be drilled with a 3, 5 x 2, 375 DualCTD setup with a 6 bit for vertical kick-off points of 2000 m and deeper. This is more than three times as long as for conventional CTD. A hydraulic model for calculating the pressure loss in the circulating system is developed. Burst and collapse pressure was found to be limiting for the maximum flow rate due to high frictional pressure loss in the circulation system in deep wells. Cutting transport capacity of the circulation system was found to be low due to the low acceptable flow rates. Cutting transport capacity will therefore limit the maximum rate of penetration. The DualCTD system will also make it possible to drill through challenging pressure regimes, depleted reservoirs and problematic zones with its unique potential for managed pressure drilling. Well control approach for the DualCTD concept will be much of the same as in underbalanced-/managed pressure CTD operations The DualCTD blow out preventer needs to be verified for cutting of the DualCTD string. <b>Running</b> <b>of</b> <b>casing</b> and cementing operations may have to be performed on drill string due to the large weight of the casing and the low axial load capacity of the DualCTD string. Significant development work is needed to bring the DualCTD to a field proven meth...|$|E

Wear <b>of</b> <b>casing</b> string is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} {{in the process of}} oil and gas exploitation, and it reduces collapse and burst strength <b>of</b> <b>casing</b> string. Stress <b>of</b> internal wall worn casing string must be analyzed to ensure strength <b>of</b> <b>casing</b> string. In the paper, wear form <b>of</b> <b>casing</b> string is assumed as a crescent-shape, and a half finite element model (FEM) <b>of</b> worn <b>casing</b> string, cement-loop and earth combined system is established using the symmetry. Geometry relationships of wear ratio (or wear depth) and the centre of drill pipe are established. Effects of variables such as wear ratio <b>of</b> <b>casing</b> string, magnification factor of wellbore, elastic modulus of cement-loop and working conditions on casing string stress are discussed respectively. Some conclusions are drawn: maximum stress in casing string increases with increased wear ratio <b>of</b> <b>casing</b> string, and ultimately exceeds the yield limit. Increase of magnification factor of wellbore will improve bearing capacity <b>of</b> <b>casing</b> string, but maximum stress in casing string decreases slower and slower with further increase in magnification factor <b>of</b> <b>casing</b> string, at the same time, stress decreases more in casing string than in cement-loop. Minimum stress in cement-loop increases and maximum stress in cement-loop fluctuates with increased elastic modulus of cement-loop, while both minimum and maximum stress in casing string first increases then decreases, the turning point is related to elastic modulus <b>of</b> <b>casing</b> string and earth, as well as the geometry relationships among them.

30|$|To {{alleviate}} or even avoid casing failure issues, proper casings {{should be}} selected {{to be used}} for well completion. Use of correct size, type, and number <b>of</b> <b>casing</b> in the well construction is halfway to success of the design. In a whole design, the integrated casing, cementing, mud, and blowout prevention control program should be taken into consideration. There are generally four types <b>of</b> <b>casings</b> used in completion: conductor pipe, surface casing, intermediate casing, and production casing. In this research, we need to utilize the four types <b>of</b> <b>casing</b> for the design and to add an intermediate casing serving as a coal protection casing.|$|R

Test results present that adhesion wear, contact fatigue, and grinding abrasion are the main wear mechanisms under impact-sliding test conditions.

So far, many simulations <b>of</b> <b>casing</b> treatments on single rotor or rotor-stator configurations were performed.

The unsteady simulations are performed with a three-dimensional time accurate Favre-averaged Navier-stokes flow solver. In order to resolve all important flow mechanisms appearing through the use <b>of</b> <b>casing</b> treatments, a computational multiblock grid consisting of approximately 2. 4 million nodes was used for the simulations. The configurations include axial slots in 4 different variations with an axial extension ranging into the blade passage of the IGV. Their shape is semicircular with no inclination in circumferential direction. The simulations proved the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>casing</b> treatments with an upstream stator. However, the results also showed that the slots have to be carefully positioned relative to the stator location. Copyright © 2008 M. Hembera et al.

The {{study on}} tension {{behavior}} <b>of</b> <b>casing</b> and dowel joint of square steel tube {{was carried out}} by using finite element analysis software ANSYS/LS-DYNA with consideration of geometric nonlinearity, material nonlinearity and contact nonlinearity. On this basis, the effects of inside tube wall thickness, main tube wall thickness, and inserting depth on failure mode, ultimate tensile load and deformation <b>of</b> <b>casing</b> and dowel joint of square steel tube was discussed. The results show that there are three types of failure modes, i. e., bolt failure, inside tube failure and main tube failure, when the joints are subjected to axial tension force. Compare to the joint with the same wall thickness of inside tube and main tube, the reduction of wall thickness of inside tube or main tube will weaken greatly the ultimate tensile load of the joint. The ultimate tensile load <b>of</b> <b>casing</b> and dowel joints is proportional to bolt shear strength, tube wall thickness, inserting depth, and tube edge length.

Thus, a model to calculate the external pressure <b>of</b> <b>casing</b> is established with finite element method. In the model a contact is built between the outer wall <b>of</b> the <b>casing</b> and the inner wall of the cement sheath. The casing external pressure can be got through extracting contact force of results. The numerical results and analysis show that: The largest casing external pressure exists {{in the direction of}} minimum horizontal stress of formation rather than {{in the direction of the}} maximum horizontal stress. There exists such matching between the cement sheath elastic modulus and formation elastic modulus: When the elastic modulus of the cement sheath is small, reducing its value is conducive to reduce the casing external pressure and to prolong casing service life. When the elastic modulus of the cement sheath is large, increasing its value is conducive to reduce the casing external pressure and to prolong casing service life. The casing external pressure will become large with the increase of Poisson's ratio of cement sheath. With the increase of the degree of the formation stress unevenness, the maximum casing external pressure increases and the smallest external decreases. The increasing of the non-uniformity degree of formation stress makes the non-uniformity degree <b>of</b> <b>casing</b> external pressure and the risk <b>of</b> <b>casing</b> failure increase.
