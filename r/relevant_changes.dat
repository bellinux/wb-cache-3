In 2003, the first naturalistic long-term study on ten users, seven of which having completed the study, found a {{high incidence of}} mood disorders and substance abuse, but few clinically <b>relevant</b> <b>changes</b> in physiological parameters or laboratory measures were noted throughout the study, and these changes were not clearly related to periods of reported AAS use. A 13-month study, which was published in 2006 and which involved 320 body builders and athletes suggests that the wide range of psychiatric side-effects induced by the use of AAS is correlated to the severity of abuse.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary {{relationships}} of species within the genus Plasmodium have been controversial. Plasmodium species were originally divided by morphology, life-cycle characteristics, and host species. However, modern molecular approaches for determining evolutionary relationships have given results which conflict with older classification methods. Many attempts to clarify Plasmodium taxonomy with molecular methods have also run into technical challenges. Ribosomal RNA sequencing, {{which is often}} used in other organisms to determine evolutionary relationships, is challenging to interpret from Plasmodium species as they maintain several different copies of ribosomal RNA which are expressed {{at different stages of}} the life cycle and which may be able to recombine with one another. Another commonly used marker for evolutionary studies has been the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) which is present in all Plasmodium species. However, analyses of CSP sequences are {{complicated by the fact that}} the sequence of CSP, which is present on the surface of the parasite during infection, is under heavy selective pressure from the host immune system. This could potentially obscure <b>relevant</b> <b>changes.</b>|$|E

Saavik from the movie The Wrath of Khan, but could not do so due to scheduling difficulties. Rob Legato organized the large scale miniature effects for the episode on set 10, with large scale but low detailed versions of the Enterprise created along with just nacelle models for the Bozeman to collide with.|$|E

2500|$|Founded in 960, the Song dynasty reunified {{most of the}} {{traditional}} Chinese heartland from the North Central Plain {{to the area of}} the Yangzi River. This ushered in an era known for its poetry, particularly the fixed-rhythm verse form of the ci, [...] and painting, particularly landscape painting, as well as other developments artistic and otherwise. However, primarily due to military reasons, in 1127, the dynasty was forced to relocate south of the Yangzi River, with the Jurchen Jin dynasty (1115–1234) assuming control in the North. Nevertheless, this [...] "Southern" [...] period of the Song dynasty was one associated with economic robustness and population growth, together with continued Chinese artistic achievements. However, in a series of military events associated with the growth of the Mongol Empire, the Yuan dynasty was established by its fifth Great Khan, Kublai, which included the former territories of both the Jin dynasty and the Southern Song.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} <b>relevant</b> <b>change</b> on the Neck Pain and Disability Scale (NPAD) and Neck Disability Index (NDI) {{and which}} questionnaire {{is the most}} responsive in patients with non-specific chronic neck pain (CNP). METHODS: Seventy-six patients with non-specific CNP in an outpatient tertiary rehabilitation setting were dichotomized into "improved" and "stable" based on global perceived effect (GPE) scores. To investigate <b>relevant</b> <b>change</b> minimal detectable change (MDC) and minimal important change (MIC) with the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) cut-off point were assessed. Comparison of responsiveness was performed using areas under the ROC curve (AUC) and correlations between change scores of NPAD and NDI, and GPE. RESULTS: MDC and MIC on NPAD (scale 0 - 100) were 31. 7 and 11. 5 points, respectively. MDC and MIC on NDI (scale 0 - 50) were 8. 4 and 3. 5 points, respectively. Changes should exceed this MDC or MIC cut-off to be interpreted as relevant. AUC was 0. 75 for both NPAD and NDI. Correlations between change scores of NPAD and NDI, and GPE were, respectively, 0. 48 (95 % CI 0. 29 - 0. 64) and 0. 49 (95 % CI 0. 30 - 0. 64).

30|$|The {{potential}} clinical {{impact of}} the reductions in RC variability with SUVref was presented in Table 3.

This reduction results from the reduction in bias and variation shown in Figure 2. In PERCIST, a threshold of 30 % is used with SUVpeak to signify either metabolic disease progression or treatment response [1]. With the combination of reconstruction protocols evaluated in this study, a hotspot would be incorrectly classified nearly 4 % of the time.|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the prospective randomized study are to investigate the clinically <b>relevant</b> <b>change</b> after anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) using measures of pain intensity (visual analog scale, VAS) and neck disability index (NDI). And {{to determine the number}} of subjects showing persistent pain and disability at 6 -year follow-up. To investigate the possibility of differences in outcome between ACDF with the cervical intervertebral fusion cage (CIFC) and the Cloward procedure (CP). Clinically <b>relevant</b> <b>change</b> and residual, postoperative pain intensity and disability after ACDF have been investigated a little. Ninety-five patients with neck and radicular arm pain lasting for at least 6  months were randomly selected to receive ACDF with the CP or the CIFC. Questionnaires concerning pain and NDI were obtained from 83 patients (87 %) at a mean follow-up time of 76  months (range 56 – 94  months). When evaluating clinical benefits regarding pain intensity 6  years after ACDF, according to different cut-off points and relative percentages, symptoms improved in 46 – 78 % of patients. Improvement in NDI was seen in 18 – 20 % of patients. Approximately 70 % of the patients had persistent pain and disability at 6 -year follow-up. There was no clinically important difference following CP versus CIFC. Thirty millimeter and 20 % in pain intensity and NDI, respectively, are reasonable criteria to suggest a clinically <b>relevant</b> <b>change</b> after ACDF. Before patients undergo ACDF, they should be informed that they have an approximate 50 % probability of achieving pain relief and little probability of functional improvement.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} availability of diachronic corpora, machine-aided identification of linguistic items that have undergone significant change {{is set to}} become an important task. This importance is heightened further if, as Hilpert and Gries (2009 : 386) have argued, approaching linguistic change in a data-driven manner can reveal otherwise unnoticed phenomena. Key to this endeavour {{is being able to}} tell apart <b>relevant</b> <b>change</b> from noise and random or other synchronic variation. This non-trivial task differs in important ways from the much more widely investigated comparison of linguistic features between two (usually contemporary) corpora and has to date not received the attention it should perhaps be afforded. In this paper, a number of methods for identifying <b>relevant</b> <b>change</b> are reviewed and a procedure suggested which has not so far been documented. This new procedure is based on a simple chi-square test for goodness of fit, combined with additional parameters. Its operation is illustrated using the example of a study conducted to investigate motivation of recent and ongoing change in Multi-word Expressions (MWEs) using data taken from the 20 -million word Swiss Text Corpus (STC). The STC is a corpus of 20 th century written German as used in Switzerland (Bickel et al 2009). Results of the application of the proposed method indicate that the procedure yields high-quality instances of significant change in the data and is applicable to MWEs as well as a range of other linguistic items. It is able to identify instances of change with fewer arbitrary decisions and able to identify a wider range of different types of change than other suggested methods. Additionally, it shows that both the structure of the data as well as particular research interests will guide the choice of method used to identify <b>relevant</b> <b>change...</b>|$|R
