Excluding the Native Americans, who were being conquered and displaced, the 13 British colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about one-third that of Britain.

5|$|In the r/K-selection model, {{the first}} {{variable}} r is the intrinsic <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>increase</b> in population {{size and the}} second variable K is the carrying capacity of a population. Different species evolve different life-history strategies spanning a continuum between these two selective forces. An r-selected species {{is one that has}} high birth rates, low levels of parental investment, and high rates of mortality before individuals reach maturity. Evolution favours high rates of fecundity in r-selected species. Many kinds of insects and invasive species exhibit r-selected characteristics. In contrast, a K-selected species has low rates of fecundity, high levels of parental investment in the young, and low rates of mortality as individuals mature. Humans and elephants are examples of species exhibiting K-selected characteristics, including longevity and efficiency in the conversion of more resources into fewer offspring.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{the first of a series}} of three which attempt to shed some light on the {{urbanization}} phenomenon, using two alternative models of rural-urban population growth. One is a model recently proposed by Keyfitz (1978) in which migration is viewed as a net flow out of the rural region; the other is a continuous two-region version of the model of population growth and distribution developed by Rogers (1968), in which the gross migration flows out of both rural and urban regions are explicitly considered. This first paper examines and compares the dynamics of these alternative models on the basis <b>of</b> constant <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>increase</b> and migration. It demonstrates the simplicity of their properties, especially in the case of the second model which also appears more realistic due to its symmetrical treatment of the rural and urban regions. In addition, it suggests the ability of both models to give some insights into the relative <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>increase</b> and in-migration in accounting for urban population growth. This potential will be made evident in the next two papers of this series, in which the factors of urban population growth will be examined under a regime <b>of</b> constant <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>increase</b> and migration (second paper) as well as under a regime <b>of</b> varying <b>rates</b> (third paper) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{demographic}} transition in the Arab countries of Western Asia in general {{has been somewhat}} peculiar. Total fertility rose substantially before it began its historical decline. Life expectancy rose at a very fast pace. The very high fertility rates, resulted in an extremely youthful populations which, combined with low mortality schedules, resulted in crude death <b>rates</b> (CDRs) <b>of</b> 3 to 4 per thousand population, that is, lower than rates ever achieved in developed and most developing countries. The maximum range between crude birth rates (CBRs) and crude death rates, therefore, reached, in some countries, particularly in the Gulf, the unprecedented levels of 4. 5 to 5 per cent a year. Looking to the near future, as the ageing process advances with the expected fall in fertility, the further gains in life expectancy will be accompanied {{by an increase in}} crude death rates. During the 100 years between 1950 and 2050, the relationship between CBRs and CDRs, therefore, is characterized by four distinct phases. This may be illustrated with data from Jordan. The first phase, from 1950 to 1970, <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>increase</b> rose rapidly because of both a rise in CBRs and a fall in CDRs.
