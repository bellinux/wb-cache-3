5|$|The common cold, {{also known}} simply as a cold, is a viral {{infectious}} disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the nose. The throat, sinuses, and larynx may also be affected. Signs and symptoms may begin less than two days following exposure. They include coughing, sore throat, <b>runny</b> <b>nose,</b> sneezing, headache, and fever. People usually recover in seven to ten days. Some symptoms may last up to three weeks. In those with other health problems, pneumonia may occasionally develop.|$|E
5|$|A cold usually {{begins with}} fatigue, {{a feeling of}} being chilled, sneezing, and a headache, {{followed}} {{in a couple of days}} by a <b>runny</b> <b>nose</b> and cough. Symptoms may begin within sixteen hours of exposure and typically peak two to four days after onset. They usually resolve in seven to ten days, but some can last for up to three weeks. The average duration of cough is eighteen days and in some cases people develop a post-viral cough which can linger after the infection is gone. In children, the cough lasts for more than ten days in 35–40% of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10%.|$|E
5|$|The typical {{symptoms}} of a cold include a cough, a <b>runny</b> <b>nose,</b> nasal congestion and a sore throat, sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite. A sore throat is present in about 40% of cases and a cough in about 50%, while muscle ache occurs in about half. In adults, a fever is generally not present but it is common in infants and young children. The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza. While a cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, {{a great deal of}} similarity exists between these two conditions. A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections.|$|E

50|$|Some Preparation H {{products}} have phenylephrine, {{a drug that}} constricts blood vessels, as an active ingredient, in a 0.25% concentration, as well as shark liver oil. Phenylephrine is more commonly used as a decongestant in cold medications, since restricting blood flow in the nasal passages will {{reduce the amount of}} mucus and/or liquid flow they create in <b>runny</b> <b>noses.</b> Because hemorrhoids are caused by inflamed blood vessels, restricting the blood flow may well reduce the size of the swelling, and reduce the pain or discomfort the person feels. Another version of Preparation H has hydrocortisone as its only active ingredient, in a 1% concentration. Again, hydrocortisone reliably reduces inflammation and swelling. A witch-hazel medicated wipe is also available under the Preparation H brand.|$|R
5|$|Well over 200 virus strains are {{implicated in}} the cause of the common cold; the rhinoviruses are the most common. They spread through the air during close contact with {{infected}} people and indirectly through contact with objects in the environment followed by transfer to the mouth or nose. Risk factors include going to daycare, not sleeping well, and psychological stress. Symptoms are mostly due to the body's immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves. People with influenza often show similar symptoms as people with a cold, though symptoms are usually more severe in the former. Influenza is less likely to result in a <b>runny</b> <b>nose.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{symptoms}} of Hunter syndrome (MPS II) {{are generally not}} apparent at birth, but usually start to become noticeable {{after the first year}} of life. Often, the first {{symptoms of}} Hunter syndrome may include abdominal hernias, ear infections, <b>runny</b> <b>noses,</b> and colds. Since these symptoms are quite common among all infants, they are not likely to lead a doctor to make a diagnosis of Hunter syndrome right away. As the buildup of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) continues throughout the cells of the body, signs of Hunter syndrome become more visible. Physical appearances of many children with Hunter syndrome include a distinctive coarseness in their facial features, including a prominent forehead, a nose with a flattened bridge, and an enlarged tongue. For this reason, unrelated children with Hunter syndrome often look alike. They may also have a large head as well as an enlarged abdomen. Many continue to have frequent infections of the ears and respiratory tract.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the adverse health effects caused by living in close {{proximity}} to a landfill and the public perception o f landfills. The main case study is that of Dunsink Landfill in Finglas, County Dublin. Other landfills focused on are Nantygwyddon Landfill in Rhondda, Wales and Miron Quarry in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. This thesis examines all forms of continuous illness found in three areas near Dunsink Landfill, not just more serious illnesses such as cancers. These illnesses range from <b>runny</b> <b>noses,</b> coughs and colds to the more serious illnesses of cancers. Public perception is dealt with by examining two opposing viewpoints of landfills and why these viewpoints have been taken. The opinions of the residents, the North-West Area Manager for Dublin City Council and Dr. Eugene Boyle of the Health Service Executive (HSE) are also taken into account. A door-to-door survey o f three areas in Finglas was used in order to obtain the information needed for the study. This survey included questions relating to health, opinions and own knowledge...|$|R

40|$|Today, many {{go for a}} run, cover {{themselves}} under blankets, or sit in the sauna {{believing that}} they can ‘sweat out’ the common cold. Whereas modern medicine has falsified the efficacy of sweating as treatment, this paper considers the development of medical research about sweating in the early modern period, particularly the prescriptions of sudorifics, or sweat-inducing drugs. This paper focuses on Johannes de Gorter (1689 – 1762), a Dutch physician practicing in the port town of Enkhuizen, where he encountered many people suffering from the common cold. After experimenting with the Santorian weighing chair in different weather conditions and studying the symptoms of slime and <b>runny</b> <b>noses,</b> de Gorter prescribed sal ammoniac as the most effective treatment to literally sweat out the cold. Asking why he believed that profuse sweating through sal ammoniac could heal the diseased body, I trace his medical and experimental work, referring to his notions of sharp, thin, and resolving particles. I argue that de Gorter, as natural philosopher and practicing physician, built upon Santorio’s corpuscular theory and combined it with {{a study of the}} chemical properties of airs, morbid secretions, and evacuant drugs. As such, this paper aims to contribute {{to our understanding of the}} relationship between medical experimentation, chemical properties, and pharmaceutical drugs in the early eighteenth century...|$|R

Many people with allergic rhinitis also have asthma, allergic conjunctivitis, or atopic dermatitis.|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{epidemiologic}} {{research on}} respiratory symptoms presents unique types of data, typically requiring simultaneous analysis of both time- and person-varying factors. In this paper, the authors propose a new, simple model that incorporates such factors and controls for each person's prior history of symptoms. The Yale Mother and Infant Health Study was undertaken {{to investigate the}} effects of ambient pollutant concentrations, meteorologic changes, and demographic variables on daily respiratory symptoms in both mothers and infants. This analysis was restricted to 673 mothers followed in southwestern Virginia from June 10 to August 31, 1995. Of the person-varying factors, husband's level of education, nested within marital status, and having pets in the home were related to an increased likelihood of new episodes; however, neither was related to duration of symptoms. Interestingly, women who were unmarried were least likely to have new episodes of respiratory symptoms, while those with the most highly educated spouses {{were most likely to}} have new episodes. Having pets in the home increased the likelihood of a new episode. Having a history of allergies and having children in day care were found {{to be related to the}} symptom of a <b>runny</b> or stuffy <b>nose,</b> in terms of both incidence and duration.

25|$|The {{withdrawal}} symptoms associated with morphine addiction are usually experienced {{shortly before the}} time of the next scheduled dose, sometimes within as early as a few hours (usually 6h to 12h) after the last administration. Early symptoms include watery eyes, insomnia, diarrhea, <b>runny</b> <b>nose,</b> yawning, dysphoria, sweating, and in some cases a strong drug craving. Severe headache, restlessness, irritability, loss of appetite, body aches, severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, tremors, and even stronger and more intense drug craving appear as the syndrome progresses. Severe depression and vomiting are very common. During the acute withdrawal period, systolic and diastolic blood pressures increase, usually beyond premorphine levels, and heart rate increases, which have potential to cause a heart attack, blood clot, or stroke.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of exposure include: nervousness/restlessness, miosis (contraction of the pupil), rhinorrhea (<b>runny</b> <b>nose),</b> excessive salivation, dyspnea (difficulty in breathing due to bronchoconstriction/secretions), sweating, bradycardia (slow heartbeat), loss of consciousness, convulsions, flaccid paralysis, loss of bladder and bowel control, apnea (breathing stopped) and lung blisters. The exact {{symptoms of}} overexposure {{are similar to}} those created by all nerve agents. Tabun is toxic even in minute doses. The number and severity of symptoms which appear vary according to the amount of the agent absorbed and rate of entry of it into the body. Very small skin dosages sometimes cause local sweating and tremors accompanied with characteristically constricted pupils with few other effects. Tabun is about half as toxic as sarin by inhalation, but in very low concentrations it is more irritating to the eyes than sarin. Also, tabun breaks down slowly, which after repeated exposure can lead to build up in the body.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Occupational {{exposures}} {{have been}} associated with an increased risk of new-onset rhinitis in apprentices. However, population-based prospective data are scarce and do not cover new onset of rhinitis later in life. The authors studied the association between occupational exposure and adult onset of rhinitis prospectively. METHODS: The data of 4994 participants (age at follow-up 28 - 57 years) from 27 centres of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey II who were symptom-free at baseline were analysed. As outcome at follow-up self-reported (a) nasal allergies ("allergic rhinitis") and (b) <b>runny,</b> blocked <b>nose</b> for 12 months a year ("perennial rhinitis") were used. Occupational exposures at any time during follow-up were defined by job title. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of allergic rhinitis, perennial rhinitis and both conditions was 12 %, 11 % and 3 %, respectively. Compared to office workers, male medical professionals were at increased risk of new onset of allergic rhinitis (OR 3. 0; 95 % CI 1. 4 to 6. 4). Odds ratios were reduced in metal workers not involved in metal making or treating (0. 3; 95 % CI 0. 1 to 0. 7). For perennial rhinitis ORs were significantly increased in cleaners (1. 4; 95 % CI 1. 0 to 2. 1).

2500|$|Ragweed allergy sufferers {{may show}} signs of oral allergy syndrome, a food allergy {{classified}} by a cluster of allergic reactions in the mouth {{in response to the}} consumption certain fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Foods commonly involved include beans, celery, cumin, hazelnuts, kiwifruit, parsley, potatoes, bananas, melons, cucumbers, and zucchini. Because cooking usually denatures the proteins that cause the reaction, the foods are more allergenic when eaten raw; exceptions are celery and nuts, which may not be safe even when cooked. Signs of reaction can include itching, burning, and swelling of the mouth and throat, <b>runny</b> eyes and <b>nose,</b> hives, and, less commonly, vomiting, diarrhea, asthma, and anaphylaxis. These symptoms are due to the abnormal increase of IgE antibodies which attach to a type of immune cell called mast cells.
