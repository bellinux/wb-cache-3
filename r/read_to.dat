40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{importance}} of parents <b>reading</b> <b>to</b> their young children. Using Australian data we find that parental <b>reading</b> <b>to</b> children at age 4 – 5 has positive and significant effects on reading skills and cognitive skills (including numeracy skills) of these children at least up to age 10 or 11. The effects on skills more closely related <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> and language are larger than those on skills such as numeracy skills. However, all findings in relation <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> and other cognitive skills are persistent and robust {{to a wide range}} of sensitivity analyses. Although <b>reading</b> <b>to</b> children is also correlated with children's non-cognitive skills, after accounting for the endogeneity of <b>reading</b> <b>to</b> children, no causal effect remains...|$|R
40|$|Information abounds {{about the}} {{benefits}} of <b>reading</b> aloud <b>to</b> elementary children (Kimmel and Segel, 1988; Trelease, 1985), but very little has been written on the merits of <b>reading</b> <b>to</b> older students. Undertaking a read aloud project with secondary students, then, is likely to raise questions such as the following: 1) will students be annoyed and feel that listening to a story is not age appropriate?; 2) will <b>reading</b> <b>to</b> students waste valuable time that could be used more wisely in reading and improving comprehension in content materials?; 3) will <b>reading</b> <b>to</b> students really motivate them to want to become independent readers...|$|R
5|$|As a child, Rowling often wrote fantasy stories {{which she}} {{frequently}} <b>read</b> <b>to</b> her sister. Aged nine, Rowling moved to Church Cottage in the Gloucestershire village of Tutshill, close to Chepstow, Wales. She attended secondary school at Wyedean School and College, {{where her mother}} worked in the science department. When {{she was a young}} teenager, her great-aunt gave her a copy of Jessica Mitford's autobiography, Hons and Rebels. Mitford became Rowling's heroine, and Rowling read all of her books.|$|E
5|$|Breslin married Jami Rutili, and {{the couple}} had three children, Shane, Paige, and Chase. He {{earned a degree in}} {{recreation}} management while at Lake Superior State. During his career, Breslin was involved in numerous charities. He delivered food on Thanksgiving for the Chris Zorich Foundation; conducted self-esteem workshops for an anti-drug, anti-gang organization; participated in the Wolves' <b>Read</b> <b>to</b> Succeed program, in which he <b>read</b> <b>to</b> children at local libraries; and several others. In a 1997 interview, Breslin said that the most special charity he helped was one started by him and his wife. The Extra Effort program was started at Indian Trail Junior High School in Addison, where Jami was a teacher. Each month the program gave both a male and a female student four tickets to a Wolves game and a gift bag. The students were chosen based on attitude, effort and attendance. After retiring from professional hockey, he coached youth hockey and helped manage an Irish pub.|$|E

40|$|Reading is not {{a unitary}} activity. Rather, skilled readers have at their {{disposal}} a variety of reading strategies which can be effectively applied {{in a wide range}} of situations. The typology presented here is an initial attempt at characterising how reading strategies are influenced by the goals and motivations of the reader. The reading styles and support activities, as well as navigational and manipulation issues are used as the means by which a characterisations of reading can be built in relation <b>to</b> specific <b>reading</b> goals. These goals include: <b>reading</b> <b>to</b> learn; <b>reading</b> <b>to</b> search/answer questions; <b>reading</b> for research; <b>reading</b> <b>to</b> summarise; <b>reading</b> <b>to</b> do; <b>reading</b> for problem solving and decision making; proofreading; reading for critical review; <b>reading</b> <b>to</b> write and revise documents; reading for enjoyment. From this characterisation it can be seen how the different reading strategies make a range of demands on the properties required of the medium in which the document is presented...|$|R

5|$|In {{view of this}} interest, Darwin {{prepared}} a paper on Catasetum as an extract from his forthcoming book, which was <b>read</b> <b>to</b> the Linnean Society of London on 3 April 1862.

To cover this, he would bring materials to within an inch of his eyes, and have clerks and his wife <b>read</b> <b>to</b> him (once when the Court took an obscenity case, a chagrined Harlan had his wife read him Lady Chatterley's Lover). Gravely ill, he retired from the Supreme Court on September 23, 1971.|$|E

5|$|Stevens {{introduced}} a Tenure of Office Act, restricting Johnson from firing officials {{who had received}} Senate confirmation without getting that body's consent.

Seward submitted it to Lincoln, who, realizing that the Union was {{in no position to}} battle both the South and Britain, toned it down considerably, and made it merely a memorandum for Adams's guidance.|$|E

40|$|Nine {{years ago}} a group of {{interested}} students of reading formed the Western Michigan University Chapter of the International Reading Association. Their purposes then, as now, were to encourage the study of reading problems at all educational levels, to stimulate and promote research in developmental, corrective and remedial <b>reading,</b> <b>to</b> study the various factors that influence progress in <b>reading,</b> <b>to</b> assist {{in the development of}} more adequate teacher-training programs, to disseminate knowledge helpful in the solution of problems related <b>to</b> <b>reading,</b> and <b>to</b> sponsor conferences and meetings planned to implement the purposes of the association...|$|R
40|$|The ability <b>to</b> <b>read</b> written {{language}} proficiently {{is an important}} skill in modern society; however, <b>reading</b> seems <b>to</b> be a lost art in many ways. In order to correct this problem, educators must determine the most effective method for teaching <b>reading</b> <b>to</b> elementary students. The most prominent methods include the whole language method, the phonetic method, and the balanced method. Research on the techniques, advantages, disadvantages, and case studies associated with each method indicates that the most effective method for teaching <b>reading</b> <b>to</b> elementary students is the balanced method...|$|R

5|$|After Congress {{approved}} the final {{wording of the}} Declaration on July 4, a handwritten copy was sent {{a few blocks away}} to the printing shop of John Dunlap. Through the night, Dunlap printed about 200 broadsides for distribution. Before long, the Declaration was <b>read</b> <b>to</b> audiences and reprinted in newspapers throughout the thirteen states. The first official public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8; public readings also took place on that day in Trenton, New Jersey and Easton, Pennsylvania. A German translation of the Declaration was published in Philadelphia by July 9.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} {{his mission to}} Muhammad Ali, Montefiore was returning to Europe by way of Constantinople. On October 15, 1840, in the Ottoman capital he {{had a meeting with}} Lord Ponsonby, to whom Montefiore suggested that following the precedent set by Suleiman the Magnificent, the sultan should issue a decree (firman) formally denouncing the blood libel and effectively sealing the cases both in Rhodes and in Damascus. The British ambassador was enthusiastic about the idea, and within one week he arranged for Montefiore a meeting with Reshid Pasha. Montefiore prepared a draft text of the firman and had its French translation <b>read</b> <b>to</b> Reshid Pasha, who responded encouragingly.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduating from}} Abha {{teachers}} college in 1999, Wail al-Shehri {{took a job}} as an elementary school physical education teacher at the Khamis Mushait airbase. Five months into the job, Shehri took leave due to mental illness and depression. Rather than conventional therapy, Wail sought consultation with Muslim clerics, and hoped that a visit to Medina would help. His treatment involved verses from the Qur'an <b>read</b> <b>to</b> him by a sheikh. He traveled to Medina together with Waleed. After the September 11 attacks, others recalled seeing the Shehri brothers in Medina.|$|E
5|$|Congress is not {{prevented}} from legislating as to tribes generally; and {{this appears to}} be what it has done in successive versions of the Nonintercourse Act. There is nothing in the Act to suggest that ‘tribe’ is to be <b>read</b> <b>to</b> exclude a bona fide tribe not otherwise federally recognized. Nor, as the district court found, is there evidence of congressional intent or legislative history squaring with appellants' interpretation. Rather we find an inclusive reading consonant with the policy and purpose of the Act.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} Thompson took control until {{shortly after the}} Second World War, the News-Miner lacked a {{dedicated}} connection to the Associated Press.

This system later was replaced by a dedicated contract with the Alaska Communications System, but that contract limited the News-Miner to no more than 9,000 words per day of messages.|$|E
