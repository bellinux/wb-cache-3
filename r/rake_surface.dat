40|$|Abstract. The {{results of}} an {{investigation}} {{on the effects of}} surface roughness on ball end mill are reported here. We used grindwheels with varying in grit between # 325 and # 1000 to grind ball end mill’s <b>rake</b> <b>surface</b> and flank surface, and then coated the end mill with TiAlN film, CrSiN film, and TiSiN film. We measured the state of adhesion on the films on the <b>rake</b> <b>surface</b> in continuous lathe milling as well as the surface roughness and cutting force. The results show that, in generating the cutting cutoff, the optimum grinding roughness differs between the near vicinity of the cutting-edge ridgeline and the part of the <b>rake</b> <b>surface</b> that is further away from the cutting-edge ridgeline. From that fact, we understand that the cutting characteristics of the work material and the surface area of the <b>rake</b> <b>surface</b> that is in contact with the cutting cutoff exert their respective influences during the cutting...|$|E

It is estimated that when chip thickness is lower, clearance surface of tool wears more intensively, influence of frictional force which acts to the <b>rake</b> <b>surface</b> is negligible, because contact sliding path of clearance surface is bigger than contact of <b>rake</b> <b>surface.</b> On increasing the thickness of chip, friction force and contact length increase.|$|E
30|$|Type III chip was {{obtained}} when the cutting angle was 90 °. The workpiece {{ahead of the}} tool was compressed by the tool and the compressed zone usually extended below the machined surface. The chip generated was also compressed and seriously damaged, and frequently stuck to the <b>rake</b> <b>surface</b> (Fig.  2 d). Since the chip tended to stick ahead of the tool, the cutting was not only done by the cutting edge {{but also by the}} stuck chip, which made the cutting unstable. When the chip made the cutting angle larger than 90 °, the workpiece above the path of the cutting edge seemed to be compressed and passed beneath the clearance face instead of removed along the <b>rake</b> <b>surface.</b> Those parts of the workpiece would be compressed and would be left on the machined surface.|$|E

In this scheme, the nature of the tines of the rake are not specified but could, for example, be surface integrins that often act as the feet of the cell to attach it to the substrate.

40|$|Carbide end mill, {{as one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used cutting tool in aluminum, titanium and steel machining industry, is of crucial importance in the industry regarding to the machining efficiency and quality. For fillet end-mill, because of its complexity geometry in flank and fillet parts, a free-form geometry model is needed for further analysis and optimization. Many research works have been conducted on building geometric model based on grinding tool path. In this thesis, a parametric and easy controlled method is proposed for design and modeling of the fillet flank and the fillet <b>rake</b> <b>surface.</b> First, the end and side clearance surface need to be established according to geometric parameters and constraints; Secondly, the fillet cutting edge is designed to achieve the machining requirement of the corner radius geometry, which is critical for the modeling of the fillet flank and the fillet <b>rake</b> <b>surface</b> face; Then, the surface of the fillet flank is supported by splines which derived from the customized two-dimensional corner. And a rake angle based method is applied for modeling of the fillet <b>rake</b> <b>surface.</b> A detailed discussion on parametric variables of this method is provided for a more accurate surface. Together with flutes and gashes, the solid model of the fillet end-mill can be modeled using Boolean operations. All the modeling process is carried out with a VB automatic program for fast and customized modeling in CATIA. In order to examine the geometry of this model, machining simulation is conducted in a finite element analysis software compared with the original model which based on grinding tool path...|$|E

40|$|The new Olympic Tennis Centre is {{peripherally}} {{located on}} the gently sloping western edge of Forest Park, the vast new landscape that visually terminates the axis of the main Olympic site. The Tennis Centre is ordered by a linear sequence of four giant platforms that step up against the slope from west to east. The sequence of raised podiums allows the forest to permeate incisively from south to north, and to establish promontories to enjoy the panoramic view across Forest Park back to the National Stadium. These heroically scaled platforms organise the 17, 400 capacity venue {{into a series of}} programmatic clusters commencing with the landscaped entry court and 2000 seat number two court, followed by the second platform of intermediate height which accommodates eight match courts. The third and highest platform contains the 10, 000 seat centre court and 4, 000 seat number one court and features recessed landscaped courtyards that provide daylight and ventilation to the facilities below. The fourth platform holds the six practices courts and allows direct access for players' to their facilities. The platform's edges are defined by horizontal bands of concrete that act as deep beams to provide large openings for the varying points of entry to the accommodation below. The venue is clearly organised and memorable as well as having a symbolic and important centre court as the climax of the architectural composition. The Centre Court demonstrates a direct and elegant tectonic solution composed in twelve segments, with a concentric upper seating bowl cantilevering out from the lower bowl that is recessed into the platform. The <b>raking</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the bowl fold into a dramatically cantilevering roof structure that shades two thirds of the seats. At night the <b>raking</b> <b>surfaces</b> are back lit providing an important effect for night games - a giant lantern hovering of the platforms that rise through the forest canopy. The Centre Court Stadium incorporates twelve tapered openings to the upper bowl and roof; a innovative strategy introduced to provide significant improvement to environmental amenity and enjoyment for players and spectators. The openings provide visual relief from the intense focus of the bowl, permit distant views of Forest Park and Olympic Green, and allow for engagement of spectators with those outside. As the major tournaments are often held during the extreme conditions of summers peak, the openings allow the release of heat that collects in the upper bowl and the inducement of a slow cyclonic air flow to increase vertical air movement to assist with the reduction of court level temperatures. Other aspects of the projects sustainability involve its extensive water/sewerage re-cycling systems and utilisation of solar heating. From a rigorous analysis of context, programme and amenity, the Tennis Centre has arisen as an ensemble of components responding specifically to their circumstance. The architecture is not derivative from cultural or metaphoric associations. The formal distinction of the architecture is achieved within the expressive potential of its components articulated with a precise and efficient purpose attuned to the local context both landscape and culture...|$|R

40|$|The {{machining}} {{and wear}} performance of TiN-coated and patterned carbide inserts incorporating indium as a solid lubricant {{are reported in}} this study. Cutting tests were conducted by turning hardened 4340 steel in both lubricated and dry conditions. During turning, periodic flank wear measurements were made. The chips formed during cutting were examined by scanning electron microscopy, as {{the condition of the}} chip reflects the conditions obtained during machining. Inserts subject to dry machining were also examined using optical microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy {{to determine the extent of}} damage on the <b>rake</b> <b>surface</b> as well as the degree of material transfer. The results showed indium to be effective in reducing flank wear during lubricated machining, but little additional benefit of patterning was observed. For dry machining, some degree of improvement was noted in the patterned sample. but the degree of lubricity brought about by the indium coating was not sufficient and the overall flank wear was higher than the lubricated tests. However, the wear and damage on the <b>rake</b> <b>surface</b> along the path of the chip was reduced by the presence of the In-containing microreservoirs. An additional test was conducted using an instrument that simulates temperature effects during machining, and it was found that the lubricity achieved by In coatings is lost above 450 degrees C. These results suggest that the use of indium is limited to below this temperature, and above this temperature transforms to a less lubricious indium oxide. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Determination of themaximum {{temperature}} during {{machining process}} and its distribution along the <b>rake</b> <b>surface</b> is of much importance as it influences the tool {{life as well}} as the quality of machined part. The power consumed in metal cutting during turning operation was largely converted into heat. Continuous or steady state machining operations like orthogonal cutting are studied by modelling the heat transfer between the tool and chip at the tool <b>rake</b> <b>surface</b> contact zone. The shear energy is created in the primary zone, where the main plastic deformation takes place, second at the chip tool interface zone where secondary plastic deformation takes place due to the friction between the heated chip and the tool takes place and the third zone where heat is generated at the work tool interface i. e., at the flanks where frictional rubbing takes place. The friction energy produced at the rake face chip contact zone and the heat balance between the chip and stationary tool are considered Numerous methods have been generated to approach the problem such asexperimental, analytical and numerical analysis. In addition temperature measurement techniques used in metal cutting have been briefly reviewed. This work includes the study oh heat influencing the cutting tool in both uncoated and coated insert. The numerical methodology used here is ANSYS. Finite element method was used to model the effect of coated and uncoated cemented carbide cutting tool. After solving the solution obtained showed that the temperature at the tip(tool-work piece contact area) was maximum and it goes on decreasing towards the surface and it was also observed that the temperature generated for coated tool is little less in comparison to uncoated cemented carbide insert this shows that the tool life can be increased by placing a coating layer of TiN. ...|$|E

Picloram (highly soluble in water) and atrazine (moderately sorbed into soil particles) at concentrations {{in the range of}} 55 and 35 µg L- 1 and kaolin clay (approximately 5 g L- 1) were mixed with 13. 000 liters of water and dispersed over the top of 5 x 10 m forested plots. Surface flow was collected 2, 4, 6, and 10 m below the disperser to evaluate the changes in concentration as it moved through the O horizon and surface soil horizon-mixing zone. Results showed that, on average, a 10 m long forested SMZ removed around 25 % of the initial concentration of atrazine and was generally ineffective in reducing the more soluble picloram. Retention of picloram was only 6 % of the applied quantity. Percentages of mass reduction by infiltration were 36 % for atrazine and 20 % for picloram. Stronger relationships existed between O horizon depth and atrazine retention than in any other measured variable, suggesting that better solid-solution contact associated with flow through deeper O horizons is more important than either velocity or soil moisture as a determinant of sorption...|$|R

The specimens in the last five castings were constructed to 1) confirm the minimum panel thickness requirement, 2) measure the development length of epoxy-coated strands in specimens containing multiple strands, 3) measure the development length of uncoated strands in specimens containing multiple and single strands, 4) observe if concrete cracks form in thin panel specimens that have a <b>raked</b> top <b>surface</b> and are reinforced with welded wire fabric and either epoxy-coated or uncoated strands, 5) measure the transfer length for specimens containing a single uncoated strand, and 6) observe the seating characteristics of the grips used for uncoated strand and epoxy-coated strands. These tests have produced several initial findings. The preliminary recommended thickness for P/C panels containing grit-impregnated, epoxy-coated strands is 3 in. and the tentative development length for uncoated and coated multiple strands is approximately 45 in. and 24 in., respectively. Further tests will address confirmation of the recommended P/C panel thickness and establish the transfer and development lengths of single and multiple, uncoated and grit-impregnated epoxy-coated strands...|$|R
40|$|Finite element {{simulations}} {{are intended}} to predict {{the effects of the}} technological parameters on the cutting process. The process simulation may reveal many aspects of the cutting process before testing it in laboratory: thermal transfer, elastic and plastic strains, hardening levels and force levels. Simulation is also used for predicting some process issues that are hard, and even impossibly noticeable. This paper analyzes the influence of the K factor on the cutting of C 70 material, {{from the point of view}} of chip formation and thermal transfer - elements considered important in the evolution of tool wear on the <b>rake</b> and flank <b>surfaces.</b> The chip formation is also studied and considered as a deciding factor in choosing the right geometry of the tool. The obtained results allow to make observation under the optimal geometry that was tested...|$|R
