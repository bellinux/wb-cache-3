50|$|There {{were several}} more tragedies at the brickyard, the first being in 1906, when an 18-year-old worker was killed, whilst trying {{to repair a}} loose board. His clothes became {{entangled}} in an overhead <b>revolving</b> <b>shaft,</b> which was spinning at 100 revolutions a minute. Having been dragged around by the machine, he was rushed to hospital, but sadly died of multiple injuries. In the inquest, no blame {{was attached to the}} company, although the worker's father was awarded £40 compensation for the loss of his son. In 1908, a six-year-old boy was killed on Gunville Lane, while playing on one of the yard's moving steam traction-engines. The engine, pulling two trucks, was returning empty from delivering bricks to the new Naval Hospital at Osborne House. Several children were playing by swinging on one of the truck's coupling bar, without the knowledge of the driver and his mate. When one child fell, he was killed instantly by the truck's wheel passing over his head. As the operators had tried to keep children away and had no knowledge that they were still there, an accidental death ruling was given. In 1911, there was almost another tragedy, when a little girl almost drowned in a deep pool at the brickyard. However, she was rescued by a young boy named Thomas Attrill, who received recognition for his bravery.|$|E

40|$|Rub {{caused by}} a {{shedding}} annular component is a severe fault happening in a steam turbine, which {{could result in a}} long-term wearing effect on the shaft. The shafting abrasion defects shortened the service life and damaged the unit. To identify the fault in time, the dynamic response of rub {{caused by a}} shedding annular component was studied as follows: (I) a rotor-bearing model was established based on the structural features of certain steam turbines; node-to-node contact constraint and penalty method were utilized to analyze the impact and friction; (II) dynamic response of the rotor-bearing system and the shedding component was simulated with the development of rub after the component was dropping; (III) fault features were extracted from the vibration near the bearing position by time-domain and frequency-domain analysis. The results indicate that the shedding annular component would not only rotate pivoting its axis but also <b>revolve</b> around the <b>shaft</b> after a period of time. Under the excitation of the contact force, the peak-peak vibration fluctuates greatly. The frequency spectrum contains two main components, that is, the working rotating frequency and revolving frequency. The same phenomenon was observed from the historical data in the field...|$|R
50|$|Operation of the Model 811 is by an {{external}} electric motor that drives a camshaft lying inside the receiver. This shaft has a spiral cam groove that engages with a lug on the bolt, so {{that as the}} <b>shaft</b> <b>revolves,</b> the bolt is moved back and forth. The shaft is also geared to the feed mechanism, so that feed is in strict synchronisation with the bolt's movements. A hang-fire safety device is provided. Fire modes are single shot, limited bursts or continuous bursts with a pre-selectable cyclic rate of fire at 125 or 400 rounds/min. The feed direction for the percussion-primed 25 × 137 ammunition can be either manually selected or remotely selected, through an electrical feeder selection device. The first round fired following selection comes from the belt that has just been selected. The external power feature {{can be used for}} maintenance and training using dummy rounds. The Model 811 can fire all NATO standard 25 × 137 ammunition. Current natures available from Nexter Munitions includes the following; High Explosive Incendiary Tracer (HEI-T), Target Practice (TP), Target Practice Tracer (TP-T), Armour-Piercing Discarding-Sabot Tracer (APDS-T) and Armour-Piercing Fin-Stabilised Discarding-Sabot Tracer (APFSDS-T). According to Nexter Systems, the accuracy of the Model 811 25 mm is such that all rounds fired will hit a 1.5 m diameter target at a range of 1,500 m.|$|R

5000|$|The mortar was {{developed}} by Herbert Garland, superintendent of laboratories at the Cairo Citadel in Egypt. [...] The weapon was of straightforward construction, comprising a plain, smoothbore, tempered steel barrel of 65mm calibre fitted at a fixed 45-degree angle to a solid wooden base. [...] The bombs themselves were variants of the Jam Tin Grenade with a steel shaft affixed. [...] The shaft protruded down {{the barrel of the}} mortar to the charge (of 5 drams of smokeless powder), leaving the bomb itself outside the barrel. [...] A white calico tail was affixed to the bomb to improve the accuracy of its flight. [...] With the barrel affixed to the base the only means of traversing was to turn the entire unit. Since the barrel was fixed at a 45 degree angle, the mortar was already set up to fire the grenade the maximum theoretical distance for a ballistic projectile. [...] To change the range the entire mortar had to be raised vertically, typically by propping it up on a box. [...] Raising only the front of the mortar so the barrel was at an angle greater than 45 degrees would reduce the distance travelled by launching the grenade into a higher trajectory more typical of a mortar. Raising the back would also reduce the distance travelled by launching the grenade into a flatter trajectory more typical of a cannon. A spotter was able to track the progress of the bomb during daylight by watching for the <b>shaft</b> <b>revolving</b> in the air and at night the sparks from the bomb's fuse marked its progress.|$|R

Introduction: 2 HP Three Phase Induction Motor, No. 83362, Type 1, Form K. 1800 R. P. M., 110 Volts, 60 Cycles, 12 amperes. The primary or rotor {{of the motor}} is mounted in a hollow {{cylindrical}} frame of cast iron. This frame also forms {{the base of the}} machine and supports two end plates which contain the rotor bearings. The bearings consist of brass boxes arranged to be lubricated by two rings in each bearing. These rings <b>revolve</b> as the <b>shaft</b> turns carrying the oil from a chamber below the bearings. The primary consists of an iron core which is built up of sheet steel stampings. The core is firmly bolted to the frame. The conductors, which are copper wires or bars, depending upon the size of the machine, are placed in grooves in the core. These coils are insulated from the core and from each other where more than one conductor is placed in a slot. The windings, which are (y) connected, are held in the slots by thin wedges of tough wood, to protect the winding from mechanical injury, and also from the mechanical pull due to the reaction of the flux in the rotor. The secondary member or rotor is built up of laminated sheet steel. The laminae are insulated from each other by sheets of tissue paper or by a coating of japan, {{in order to reduce the}} loss by eddy currents which are induced by the flux. The conductors in this member are heavy copper bars which are short circuited at the ends of the rotor by heavy copper plates...|$|R
40|$|In Japan, {{the power}} tillers {{have come into}} {{extensive}} use in recent years, but the vibration tests of these kind of machinery are not performed up to the present. The vibration of the machine causes the machine troubles and the operator's fatigue is grown severely, thus the author investigated experimentally the vibration and its prevent of a Rotary Tiller driven by a horizontal single cylinder water cooled engine. The vibrations were measured in the stationary various states of the machine, and the author designed the rubber vibration absorbers should be suitable to the machine. The results may be summarized as follows: [I] Vibration Test (1) The vibrations were measured mostly at the center point of the handle, on longitudinally, transversely and vertically by the Askania type hand vibrograph. (2) The vibrations are occured by the revolution of the engine and the rotor shaft. The frequencies are indicated nearly equal to the revolutions and the torque fluctuations of the engine, and the revolutions of the rotor shaft. (3) The amplitudes were changed by the revolutions of the engine and {{the states of the}} machine. (4) The vertical vibration was enormousely and the transverse vibraiton was merely, when it driven by the engine only. (5) The transverse vibration was enormousely, when it was driven by the engine and <b>revolved</b> the rotor <b>shaft.</b> (6) The amplitudes was most merely, when the machine was set at horizontally or lowered the front. (7) The longitudinally amplitudes of the whole parts were the same almost, but the transverse and vertical amplitudes were most merely at {{near the center of the}} machine. [II] Vibration Prevent (1) To prevent the vibration, the Rubber Vibration Absorbers were used and those rubber vibration absorbers were set between the engine and the engine bed. (2) By the Pressure type of rubber vibration absorbers, the vibration were could prevented satisfactory at the higher revolutions of the engine, but it could not prevent the vibration at the lower revolutions of the engine. (3) By the Shear type of rubber vibration absorber, it could prevent satisfactory the vertical vibration but it was difficult to prevent perfectly the longitudinal and the transverse vibrations. (4) Thus the author designed the Non-coupled type rubber vibration absorber, because it could not prevent satisfactory the vibration by the coupled type rubber vibration absorber. (5) By the Non-coupled type rubber vibration absorber, it could prevent thoroughly the three direction vibrations, but it could not still more avoid the influence of the belt tension. Therefore the author shall study the form and the arrangment of the Non-coupled rubber vibration absorber to prevail the belt influence...|$|R
5000|$|The concentrating {{machine for}} slimes, which has {{hitherto}} {{been a great}} favourite, is the round buddle, and this was perhaps due to the great simplicity of its construction, which permitted its being made out of the odds and ends of machinery usually to be found on a mine. The fixed and <b>revolving</b> cast-iron heads, <b>shafting,</b> bevel wheels, and driving pulleys, are usually procured from a firm of machinery makers.The buddle itself consists of a shallow circular pit formed in the ground from 14 ft. to 22 ft. diameter, and from 1 ft. to 1½ ft. deep. The poorer the slimes the greater the diameter, and as the product from the buddle always requires re-treatment, it is usual to concentrate first in a machine of small diameter, and then to re-treat the concentrates thus produced in one of a larger diameter. The sides of the buddle pit are formed of stone or brick, set in mortar, and the floor, which has an inclination outwards of 1 in 30, is made either of smooth planed boards or cement run upon a layer of concrete. The centre head is from 6 ft. to 10 ft. in diameter, and may even be less. A revolving head is fixed to the shaft, and this carries four arms. The revolving head receives the slime waters from the trough, and distributes them on an even layer over the fixed head the liquid stream, which {{should be in a}} uniform thin film, falls {{over the edge of the}} fixed head, and distributes itself outwards over the sloping floor of the buddle towards the circumference, depositing in its passage the rich ore it contains, according to its specific gravity, the richest first, close to the fixed head, and the poorest at the circumference. To each of the four arms a board is attached, carrying a cloth or a series of brushes, which sweep round and smooth out each successive layer of mineral as soon as it is formed. In some cases sprays of fresh water are used instead of the cloths or brushes, the number of revolutions in either case being 3 or 4 per minute.The outflow of the waste waters takes place through the small sluice gate shown in the circumference of the huddle. In the door of this sluice is a vertical line of holes, and, as the layer of mineral thickens on the floor, a plug is placed in the lowest hole, and so successively up the series, until the full thickness of the deposit equal to the height of the cone is reached. At this point the machine is stopped, a groove is cut from the cone to the circumference, and samples of the ore are taken and washed on a vanning shovel. By this means an idea is formed as to where the divisions should be made for at the head the concentrates are rich in galena, and then follow the mixed ores, either of galena, blende, and gangue, if blende is present, or of galena and gangue, if it is absent. Two qualities of the mixed ores are formed. Rings are formed around the deposit on the buddle to indicate the division lines. The rich heads are taken out and reworked once in another buddle, when they will be rich enough to be sent to the dolly tub. The middles are likewise re-treated, the ores of approximately the same percentage being treated in the same machine until all the mineral is abstracted, and the waste contains not more than ½ per cent. of lead, and 1 to 1½ per cent. of zinc. By successive re-treatment the minerals may thus be enriched up to 50 to 60 per cent. Pb., and when blende is present, to about 42 per cent. Zn. These concentrates may either be sold as they are, or further enriched in a dolly tub.The great drawbacks to the round buddle are the facts that no clean products can be made straight away. The mineral must be handled several times, always a costly proceeding, and the machine must be stopped when full, and lie idle until emptied. A large number of buddles are always required to cope with the slimes from even a small mill, while in large mills, especially when blende is present, from sixteen to twenty would be needed.|$|R
