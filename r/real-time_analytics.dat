40|$|Abstract. The {{emergence}} {{of a range of}} new technologies like auto-identification devices, active tags, and smart items has impacted profoundly on business software solutions such as supply chain management, logistics, and in-ventory control. Integration of automatic data acquisition with enterprise appli-cations as well as potential to provide <b>real-time</b> <b>analytic</b> functionality is opening new avenues for business process automation. In this paper, we propose a novel application of these technologies in a retailing environment leading to the vi-sion of a smart shop floor. We firstly present the infrastructure for the smart shop floor. We then demonstrate how the proposed infrastructure is feasible and conducive to real-time acquisition of buyer behaviour data through three se-lected queries. Complete algorithmic solutions to each query are presented to provide proof of concept, and further deliberations on analytic potential of the proposed infrastructure are also provided.
