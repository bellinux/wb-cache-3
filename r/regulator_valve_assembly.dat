5000|$|To {{start the}} engine, the <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> V was opened and steam {{admitted}} into the cylinder from the boiler, filling the space beneath the piston. The <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> was then {{closed and the}} water injection valve V briefly snapped open and shut, sending a spray of cold water into the cylinder. This condensed the steam and created a partial vacuum under the piston. Pressure differential between the atmosphere above the piston and the partial vacuum below then drove the piston down making the power stroke, bringing the beam [...] "into the house" [...] and raising the pump gear.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Newly {{developed}} turbocharger Swing <b>valve</b> <b>assembly</b> (arm and bush) has to {{be tested}} to study the product life cycle and to know the satisfactory working throughout entire duty cycle. The turbine housing consists of swing <b>valve</b> <b>assembly</b> used to bypass the exhaust gas directly to atmosphere whenever not required. This assembly consists of two types of fits. Interference fit between turbine housing and bush and clearance fit between bush and arm. But, it is expensive and requires more time to carry out experimental study and measurements can be made only at {{the limited number of}} time stations. So, Finite element method is considered as a standard approach which is economical avoiding frequent experimental studies to find the performance of turbochargers. This paper deals with structural analysis of turbochargerâ€™s swing <b>valve</b> <b>assembly</b> where von misses stress distributions are plotted for both minimum and maximum interference cases due to thermal loads acting b/w bush and turbine housing. Meshed turbocharger and swing <b>valve</b> <b>assembly</b> model is imported to ANSYS for solving and preprocessing and given run for structural analysis. Finally contact pressure v/s time graph is plotted...|$|R

After donning safety glasses and hearing protection a check is made to ensure the needle valve is fully closed. The main valve on the cylinder is then opened, followed by the <b>regulator</b> <b>valve.</b> Next, the needle valve is opened and the balloon begins to inflate. As the balloon reaches the correct size the inflation nozzle will begin to lift. At this point the needle valve is closed along with the <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> and cylinder vale. The string is then used to tie off the balloon neck to ensure that no gas can escape.|$|R

40|$|During routine flight {{servicing}} {{operation on}} an {{aircraft in the}} hanger, the oxygen charging trolley exploded and caught fire. After examination of the wreckage at the accident site, the Board of Inquiry referred a few samples of burst pipelines and hoses to the laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed that the pipelines and the hoses in question have failed by bursting due to sudden rise in pressure. From the evidences on the failed samples and {{the sequence of events}} that led to the accident, it appears most probable that the sudden rise in pressure was due to malfunctioning of the pressure <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> in the system. In view of this, it is suggested that the pressure <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> which controls the oxygen pressure during charging of the aircraft be examined in detail...|$|R

50|$|All modern {{pressure}} cookers {{will have}} a pressure <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> and a pressure relief valve as a safety mechanism to prevent explosion {{in the event that}} the pressure <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> fails to adequately release pressure. Some older models lack a safety release valve. Most home cooking models are built to maintain a low and high pressure setting. These settings are usually between 7 and 15 PSI. Almost all home cooking units will employ a very simple single-stage pressure regulator. Older models will simply use a small weight on top of an opening that will jiggle to allow excess pressure to escape. Newer models usually incorporate a spring-loaded valve that lifts and allows pressure to escape as pressure in the vessel rises. Some pressure cookers {{will have a}} quick release setting on the pressure <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> that will, essentially, lower the spring tension to allow the pressure to escape at a quick, but still safe rate. Commercial kitchens also use pressure cookers, in some case using oil based pressure cookers to quickly deep fry fast food. In this case, {{and in the case of}} cooking at home, pressurized vessels can be used to cook food much more rapidly than it would take to cook large amounts of food without pressure. Pressure vessels of this sort can also be used to sterilize small batches of equipment and in home canning operations.|$|R
