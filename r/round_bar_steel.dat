Six reinforced concrete beams with typical dimension of 120 mm x 240 mm x 1600 mm were made and divided into: (a) three beams were made of non fibrous concrete with vertical stirrups (code D 1, D 2, and D 3), (b) three beams were made of fibrous concrete with vertical stirrups (code D 1 F, D 2 F, and D 3 F). The local fiber weight added into the mixture were 46. 76 kg per cubic meter of concrete, Vf = 0. 7 %. Plain <b>round</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> with 16 mm diameters were used to provide the main tensile reinforcement. The yield stress of the steel was 446 MPa.

40|$|Abstract The {{interface}} area in laser cladding, micro-structures {{and mechanical}} properties of which determine the structural {{integrity of the}} laser-deposited coating, consists of two distinctive zones: the dilution and heat-affected zones (HAZs). The dilution region is the region where melted substrate forms a mixture with coating material and possesses microstructure similar to the coat-ing. The HAZ is the region that lies in the substrate but possesses different microstructures compared with original substrate due to heat transfer from melt pool during pro-cessing. There are limited data available on mechanical properties of the dilution and HAZ and, in this study, the mechanical properties of the two regions have been eval-uated using nanoindentation. This testing technique {{has the ability to}} resolve the mechanical properties at fine spac-ings, unlike microhardness testing and conventional mechanical testing. Stellite 6 powder was deposited onto a <b>round</b> <b>bar</b> AISI 4130 <b>steel</b> using a continuous wave Nd:YAG laser. The effect of laser cladding process on the microstructure, hardness, and elastic modulus of the coat-ing, at the interface has been examined by nanoindentation testing. The elastic modulus of the substrate measured was found to be 198. 76 ± 24. 96 GPa, which is in a good agreement with the standard elastic modulus of AISI 4130 reported in literature. For the laser clad specimen, dilution area showed elastic modulus of 192. 62 ± 7. 67 GPa, slightly higher than the average elastic modulus of the HAZ, 189. 94 ± 14. 75. This is due to the dilution area containing a mixture mainly of Fe, Cr and Co. The increased level of Fe in this dilution area leads the ten-dency of this region to behave as substrate...|$|R
