This {{performs}} a similar function to a North American hook flash button but is much shorter duration, typically 80ms to 100ms, vs. 250ms in North America. In some networks, pressing R toggles between the calls, similar to North America. However, {{in most countries}} there are further options: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{more limited}} {{three-way}} calling is available (usually at an extra charge) on home or office phone lines. For a three-way call, the first called party is dialed. Then the hook flash button (or <b>recall</b> <b>button)</b> is pressed {{and the other}} called party's phone number is dialed. While it is ringing, flash/recall is pressed again to connect the three people together. This option allows callers to add a second outgoing call to an already connected call.|$|E

50|$|Button joined League Two side Crewe Alexandra on a month's loan on 22 July 2009 and {{he played}} in the first three games of the season, keeping two clean sheets. <b>Button</b> was <b>recalled</b> by Tottenham after his loan finished, but he re-joined Crewe on a three-month loan on 1 September. He made his second debut for Crewe 5 September against Macclesfield Town and was {{credited}} with an assist for Joel Grant's winning goal in the 2-1 victory. After a further six appearances, Tottenham <b>recalled</b> <b>Button</b> on 27 October. On 20 November 2009, Button joined League Two side Shrewsbury Town on loan until January 2010. His loan was extended by a further month in January and then {{until the end of the}} season in February. He had a successful spell, making 26 appearances and keeping 9 clean sheets.|$|R
40|$|John Button’s prognostications on {{the state}} of the Labor Party have already {{attracted}} substantial discussion. Coming little more than six months after Labor lost the federal election — and also lost a good deal of self-respect — he has caught the moment in the political cycle when doubt sets in. "Beyond Belief" claims that Labor is now at the lowest ebb of its hundred years in Australian politics. As an historical claim, this seems dubious. Its present electoral condition, a few seats short of a majority in the Commonwealth parliament, and holding office in every one of the states and territories, is far stronger than in earlier periods in the wilderness, both between the wars and during the 1950 s and 1960 s. John <b>Button</b> <b>recalls</b> Jim Cairns holding the faithful at a cold outdoor meeting in 1955; but that was in the aftermath of the Split that kept Labor in the wilderness for a further seventeen years and that led one commentator to ask whether the ALP was doomed to "Labor in Vain"...|$|R
40|$|FRONT COVER: A {{wealth of}} {{advertising}} <b>buttons</b> <b>recalls</b> the bicycle craze that swept the United States a century ago. By 1895 hun-dreds of manufacturers of bicycles, tires, and accessories wooed buyers with these collectible lapel pins, distributed free {{or for the}} price of stamps. Organizations similarly promoted causes such as good roads or events such as races. Most buttons were small (7 / 8 -inch diameter) and made from celluloid, an easily molded synthetic discovered in the search for an ivory substitute. Others were old-fashioned metal. Durable, attractive, and inexpensive, these colorful promotions (now in the Minnesota Historical Society’s museum collections) reflect the enthusiastic response of the American public to two-wheeled mobility. For a look at the craze in the Red River Valley and the social change that accompanied it, turn to the article beginning on page 268. Photograph by Peter Latner Emma Brock (1886 – 1974) described her career choice, to write and illustrate children’s books, in the simplest ofterms: “I am interested in children. ” More than 30 books stand as witness to her interest and ability...|$|R
40|$|In sports games, it {{is often}} {{necessary}} to perceive {{a large number of}} moving objects (e. g., the ball and players). In this context, the role of peripheral vision for processing motion information in the periphery is often discussed especially when motor responses are required. In an attempt to test the basal functionality of peripheral vision in those sports-games situations, a Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) task that requires to track a certain number of targets amidst distractors, was chosen. Participants’ primary task was to recall four targets (out of 10 rectangular stimuli) after six seconds of quasi-random motion. As a second task, a button had to be pressed if a target change occurred (Exp 1 : stop vs. form change to a diamond for 0. 5 s; Exp 2 : stop vs. slowdown for 0. 5 s). While eccentricities of changes (5 - 10 ° vs. 15 - 20 °) were manipulated, decision accuracy (<b>recall</b> and <b>button</b> press correct), motor response time as well as saccadic reaction time were calculated as dependent variables. Results show that participants indeed used peripheral vision to detect changes, because either no or very late saccades to the changed target were executed in correct trials. Moreover, a saccade was more often executed when eccentricities were small. Response accuracies were higher and response times were lower in the stop conditions of both experiments while larger eccentricities led to higher response times in all conditions. Summing up, it could be shown that monitoring targets and detecting changes can be processed by peripheral vision only and that a monitoring strategy on the basis of peripheral vision may be the optimal one as saccades may be afflicted with certain costs. Further research is planned to address the question whether this functionality is also evident in sports tasks...|$|R
