40|$|Solitary rectal ulcer {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} benign disorder that has {{a wide range of}} clinical presentations and variable endoscopic fi ndings which makes it diffi cult to diagnose and treat. The clinical and endoscopic picture in this condition can also mimic malign ulceration, malignancy or Crohn’s disease. Behçet’s disease can affect the gastrointestinal tract. However {{to the best of our}} knowledge, no case with solitary <b>rectal</b> <b>ulceration</b> has been reported so far in literature. We herein present a patient diagnosed with Behçet’s disease admitted to our clinic with rectal bleeding due to solitary <b>rectal</b> <b>ulceration...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{association}} of the anti-anginal drug nicorandil with oral and anal ulceration is becoming more widely recognised, {{but there are no}} reports of isolated nicorandil-induced <b>rectal</b> <b>ulceration.</b> Awareness of this condition is poor, and patients often undergo unnecessary surgery for a condition which resolves on stopping the medication. We report a case of nicorandil-induced <b>rectal</b> <b>ulceration</b> causing rectal bleeding. The patient was spared surgery after awareness of the link with this drug. This diagnosis should be considered in patients with unexplained gastrointestinal ulceration after exclusion of serious underlying causes. We hope this report will increase awareness amongst physicians and surgeons of this reversible condition. </p...|$|E

40|$|Five {{patients}} with chronic ulcerative colitis underwent endorectal excision of the rectal mucosa without removing the rectal muscle in combination with total colectomy and cutaneous ileostomy. This operative technique will cure the patient of the primary disease and obviates many of the usual unpleasant complications following total proctectomy, such as prolonged perineal drainage and sexual and bladder dysfunction. It has the further advantages of lower operative blood loss and earlier safe ambulation. On the basis of favorable clinical experience with these patients, {{we believe that the}} operation warrants further clinical trial in patients who have biopsy-proven ulcerative colitis without severe <b>rectal</b> <b>ulcerations</b> as well as in certain other nonmalignant conditions originating in the rectal mucosa...|$|R
50|$|When {{a portion}} of the {{intestinal}} tract is forcefully pulled from or expelled from the body through the anus, it is referred to as transanal evisceration. Following the first report of transanal small intestine evisceration by Brodie in 1827, more than 70 cases have been reported to date, the majority occurring spontaneously in elderly individuals. Straining, chronic constipation, and <b>rectal</b> <b>ulcerations</b> predispose to spontaneous perforation in elderly individuals. Cases of transanal evisceration of children whilst sitting over uncovered swimming pool drains have been reported; notable cases include Valerie Lakey (1993) and Abigail Taylor (2007). In Taylor's case, the suction dislodged and damaged her liver and pancreas; several meters of her small intestine were forcefully pulled through her anus. In both these cases, the victims were left with short bowel syndrome and required feeding by total parenteral nutrition. After multiple operations, Taylor later died from transplant-related cancer.|$|R
40|$|A 63 {{year old}} Asian woman who {{presented}} with three week's abdominal pain {{was found to}} have a hard right iliac fossa mass and <b>rectal</b> <b>ulceration.</b> Profuse rectal bleeding necessitated a laparotomy. An inflammatory paracaecal mass with fistulae involving appendix, small bowel, and bladder was excised with exteriorisation of the bowel ends. Microscopy showed invasive amoebae. Re-anastomosis was successfully done after treatment with metronidazole and diloxanide. There are no previous reports of a paracaecal amoeboma with fistulae to either the appendix, or urinary bladder...|$|E
40|$|The {{cause of}} solitary <b>rectal</b> <b>ulceration</b> has been {{investigated}} using a method that radiologically visualises rectal voiding whilst simultaneously measuring intrarectal pressure and external anal sphincter electromyographic activity. Control subjects and patients with the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome, both with and without mucosal ulceration, have been studied. A high incidence of rectal prolapse (94 %) was present in the patients who voided. Overactivity of the anal sphincter during evacuation contributed {{to the fact that}} patients with mucosal ulceration required higher intrarectal pressures to void than the controls and the patients without mucosal ulceration. The results indicate that a combination of rectal prolapse and a high voiding pressure may act to cause the mucosal ulceration in this syndrome by exposing the rectal wall to a high transmural pressure gradient...|$|E

40|$|<b>Rectal</b> <b>ulcerations</b> are an {{uncommon}} {{presentation of a}} primary syphilis infection. Anorectal syphilis is difficult to diagnose because of its often asymptomatic or atypical clinical presentation. It {{is important to consider}} sexually transmitted diseases (STD) in all patients presenting with rectal symptoms. A history of anal sexual intercourse should be made, especially in men having sex with men (MSM). Moreover, the possibility of a primary syphilis infection of the rectum should be considered. Endoscopic findings might be diverse, whereas a typical chancre can present as an anorectal ulcer associated with regional lymphadenopathy. It is important to consider other causes of anorectal ulcers, like other STD, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or even malignant causes. The diagnosis of anorectal syphilis is based on the combination of the clinical presentation, serology tests, endoscopic findings and biopsies. The cornerstone of the treatment is based on an intramuscularly administration of a long-acting preparation of penicillin (benzathine penicillin G). status: accepte...|$|R

40|$|Extrapulmonary {{infection}} with Pneumocystis carinii, although uncommon, is increasingly recognized. Use of aerosolized pentamidine versus a systemic medication {{is thought to}} be a contributing factor due to the low concentrations of drug that are incapable of suppressing systemic infection. Infection with P carinii has been reported in every organ system including the gastrointestinal system. A 28 -year-old acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patient receiving prophylaxis with aerosolized pentamidine who presented with a solitary rectal ulcer is reported. Initial biopsy was characteristic of extrapulmonary P carinii infection, with numerous organisms present. Occasional cytomegalovirus inclusion bodies were noted which may have been a copathogen but which were not treated. Treatment with intravenous pentamidine resulted in documented eradication of P carinii and complete resolution of the ulcer. Although lower gastrointestinal pneumocystosis has been described without ulceration, this is the first description of <b>rectal</b> <b>ulceration</b> presenting as the initial manifestation of extrapulmonary pneumocystosis...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{thalidomide}} {{has been}} used for the treatment of a variety of ulcerative and immunologic conditions. Several previous reports have suggested that thalidomide therapy is beneficial for patients with aphthous ulceration related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We describe the use of thalidomide in 20 HIV-infected patients with oropharyngeal, esophageal, and <b>rectal</b> <b>ulceration.</b> Nineteen patients had a dramatic response to thalidomide therapy, with both subjective and objective abatement in the signs and symptoms of their ulcerative disease. The standard treatment course was 200 mg of thalidomide for 14 days (the drug was administered at night). Four patients required additional courses of treatment because symptoms recurred after thalidomide therapy was stopped. Side effects due to thalidomide included rash (5 patients), peripheral neuropathy (1 patient), and excessive fatigue (1 patient). There {{did not appear to be}} any adverse immunologic effects in thalidomide-treated patients. The mechanism of the effect of thalidomide is uncertain, although recent studies have suggested that thalidomide selectively inhibits the production of tumor necrosis factor α...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aims: Solitary rectal ulcer {{syndrome}} (SRUS) {{is a rare}} {{disorder that}} has {{a wide spectrum of}} clinical presentation and variable endoscopic findings. To further characterize the clinical and pathological features, a retrospective, hospital-based clinicopathological study was conducted. Materials and Methods: All cases of SRUS diagnosed at Farwania Hospital, Kuwait, between 2002 and 2007 were retrieved from the computerized filing system. The histological slides were reviewed by two authors to confirm the diagnosis. Immunohistochemical stain for smooth muscle actin (SMA) was performed. The clinical files were reviewed for clinical features and endoscopic findings. Results: Thirteen cases were identified: 8 males and 5 females. The age range was 15 - 85. Rectal bleeding, constipation, and abdominal pain were the most common presenting symptoms and were seen, either alone or in various combinations, in 12 of the 13 cases. <b>Rectal</b> <b>ulceration</b> was the most common endoscopic finding, being seen in 9 of the 13 cases; 3 of these cases had multiple ulcerations. Two patients had rectal polyps, with one of them having multiple polyps. The histological examination revealed surface serration, fibromuscular obliteration of the lamina propria, and crypts&#x 2032; distortion in all the cases. Seven of the cases had diamond crypts. Ectatic mucosal vessels were a common finding. Positivity for SMA in the lamina propria was seen in all examined cases. Conclusion: SRUS is a rare disorder and only 13 cases were diagnosed in Farwania hospital over a 6 -year period. The clinical presentation of our patients was variable. The presence of polyps and multiple ulcerations on endoscopy is further evidence that SRUS is a misnomer. Surface serration, fibromuscular obliteration, and crypts&#x 2032; distortion are the most characteristic features. The presence of diamond crypts is an additional diagnostic feature...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPlasmin(ogen) is an {{extracellular}} {{serine protease}} {{implicated in the}} activation of latent growth factors and procollagenase, degradation of extracellular matrix components, and fibrin clearance. Plasminogen (Plg) deficiency in mice results in high mortality, wasting, spontaneous gastrointestinal <b>ulceration,</b> <b>rectal</b> prolapse, and severe thrombosis. Furthermore, Plg-deficient mice display delayed wound healing following skin injury, a defect partly related to impaired keratinocyte migration. We generated mice deficient in Plg and fibrinogen (Fib) and show that removal of fibrin(ogen) from the extracellular environment alleviates the diverse spontaneous pathologies previously associated with Plg deficiency and corrects healing times. Mice deficient in Plg and Fib are phenotypically indistinguishable from Fib-deficient mice. These {{data suggest that the}} fundamental and possibly only essential physiological role of Plg is fibrinolysis...|$|R
40|$|The article “Rectal dose {{assessment}} in patients submitted to high-dose-rate brachytherapy for uterine cervix cancer ” {{published in the}} present issue of Radiologia Brasileira deals with a relevant theme currently discussed in radiotherapy and oncology. Radiation proctitis is condition of the rectum caused by ionizing radiation. It may be acute (arising during or right after radiation therapy), and in these case is generally self-limited. Symptoms of acute proctitis are diarrhea, eventual bleeding, mucus loss or constipation. Histological changes are limited to the mucosa, and the cells with a more rapid turnover are the most sensitive ones. Late radiation proctitis may occur {{up to two years}} after radiation therapy with more severe symptoms: mucus loss, pain, <b>rectal</b> urgency, bleeding, <b>ulceration,</b> stenosis and even rectovaginal fistulas. In late radiation proctitis, histological findings correspond to changes of vascular nature and fibrosis of the subintimal layer. Radiation proctitis severity is directly proportional to the dose received and dose volume, {{as well as to the}} number of fractions and the length of the interval betwee...|$|R
40|$|A 36 -year-old man {{was seen}} at the {{outpatient}} clinic after referral by his general practitioner to exclude underlying perianal abscess since the patient was complaining about mushy stools mixed with blood and mucus during the last four days. At the same time, he mainly suffered from a perianal discomfort, abdominal pain and a fever (38. 9 degrees Celsius). He had no prior important medical history. Familial history revealed a sister with severe Crohn’s disease. Further systemic history didn’t reveal any important issues. A physical examination showed a mild abdominal tenderness in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Anal inspection {{showed no signs of}} an abscess or fistula. Adenopathies could not be clinically discovered. Laboratory analyses demonstrated a normal white blood cell count (8. 69 x 10 * 9 /l) with a normal differentiation, but an elevated C-reactive protein level (40 mg/l [0. 0 – 5. 0]) was seen. The remainder of the blood analysis was satisfying. We performed a stool analysis that could not identify any pathogens. Analysis of fecal calprotectin turned out to be highly positive (814 microgram / g feces, whereas a normal range is below 50). The patient was admitted the same day in the hospital for a semi-urgent diagnostic work-up. We performed a magnetic resonance imaging of the lower abdomen and pelvis for the purpose of excluding hidden abscesses and fistulae, also because this was the reason of patient referral by the general practitioner since the patient had a sister with severe Crohn’s disease with perianal manifestations. The images showed an edematous rectal abdominal wall with inflammatory infiltration of the mesorectal adipose tissue and the presence of enlarged lymphatic nodules. An ileocolonoscopy was performed the day after. There was a normal appearing mucosa of the terminal ileum and colon, except for the inspection of the rectal mucosa, which showed multiple atypical mucosal ulcerations with adjacent edematous mucosa. Multiple biopsies were taken as well of the ileum, the colon as the rectum. The anatomopathological findings of the terminal ileum and colon were normal. Those of the rectum showed a mild chronic inflammatory reaction suggestive of an infectious colitis with also an excess of plasma cells in the inflammatory infiltrate. There was no evidence for underlying inflammatory bowel disease. Taking into account that the rectal ulcers had atypical characteristics, we asked for sexual behavior. Because the patient admitted having unprotected anal intercourse, we performed testing for sexually transmitted disease (STD). The analyses of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae on a rectal swab and on an urine sample (to exclude urethritis as a co-infection) were negative. We also performed a more general diagnostic work-up for other STD by screening for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV by serologic tests. These results turned out to be negative. Laboratory analyses demonstrated a positive Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA) (index 15. 8, positive when > 1. 1) and a positive Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test (VDRL). We established the diagnosis of an early primary syphilis infection of the anorectum, also described as a syphilitic proctitis, and treated the patient and his sexual partner with one intramuscular injection of 2. 4 million units of benzathine penicillin G. An endoscopic reassessment was performed six weeks after initiation of the treatment. This showed a proper endoscopic healing with remaining small stellate scars. Control of serologic tests after treatment showed a negativation of the VDRL test while the TPHA test remained positive. <b>Rectal</b> <b>ulcerations</b> are an uncommon presentation of a primary syphilis infection or primary syphilitic proctitis. It is difficult to diagnose because of its often asymptomatic or atypical clinical presentation.

40|$|Introduction: In {{severe cases}} {{refractory}} to medical treatment, APC {{appears to be}} the preferred alternative to control persistent rectal bleeding of patients with chronic radiation proctitis. Although successful outcomes have been demonstrated in patients previously treated with moderate doses of radiotherapy, there is reluctance towards its indication due to the concern of severe adverse events in patients treated with high doses of radiation. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the efficacy and toxicity of APC in the management of bleeding radiation-induced proctitis in patients treated with high doses of radiation for prostate cancer. Methods and materials: Data from 30 patients were treated with APC due to chronic radiation proctitis, were reviewed retrospectively. All cases had prostate cancer and 9 of them (30 %) underwent previous radical prostatectomy. The median dose of conformal 3 D External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT) delivered was 74 Gy (range 46 - 76). Median rectal D 1 cc and D 2 cc was 72. 5 and 72. 4 Gy respectively. Median rectal V 70, V 60 and V 40 was 12, 39. 5 and 80 %. Cardiovascular and digestive disease, diabetes, smoking behaviour, lowest haemoglobin and transfusion requirements were recorded. Indications for treatment with APC were anemia and persistent bleeding despite medical treatment. Argon gas flow was set at 1. 8 l/min with an electrical power setting of 50 W. Results: Median age of all patients was 69. 6 years. The median lowest haemoglobin level was 9. 6 g/dL. Median time between completion of radiotherapy and first session of APC was 13 months. Ninety-four therapeutic sessions were performed (median 3 sessions). Median time follow-up was 14. 5 months (range 2 - 61). Complete response with resolved rectal bleeding was achieved in 23 patients (77 %), partial response in 5 (16 %) and no control in 2 (6 %). No patients required transfusion following therapy. Two patients developed long-term (> 6 weeks) grade 2 <b>rectal</b> <b>ulceration</b> and grade 2 rectal incontinence, respectively. Conclusions: The argon plasma coagulation is an effective and safe management option in patients with medically refractory rectal bleeding after high doses of radiation for prostate cancer...|$|E
40|$|Allergy to {{components}} of the diet is followed by gut inflammation which in children, sometimes progress to mucosal lesions and anaphylaxis. In newborns suffering of cow`s milk allergy, bloody stools, <b>rectal.</b> bleeding and <b>ulcerations</b> are found. The rat systemic anaphylaxis is a suitable model to study the intestinal lesions associated to allergy. In the present study we used this model to investigate some mechanisms involved. We found that 15 min after antigen challenge of sensitized rats, hemorrhagic lesions develop in the small intestine. The lesions were more severe in jejunum and ileum compared to duodenum. Pretreatment of the rats with a platelet-activating factor-receptor antagonist (WEB- 2170) reduced the lesions whereas inhibition of endogenous nitric oxide by L-NAME, greatly increased the hemorrhagic lesions and mortality. Both, lesions and mortality were reversed by L-arginine. The hemorrhagic lesions were also significantly reduced by the mast cell stabilizers, disodium cromoglycate and ketotifen {{as well as by}} neutrophils depletion (with anti-PMN antibodies) or inhibition of selectin binding (by treatment with fucoidan). Thus, the intestinal hemorrhagic lesions in this model are dependent on ptatelet-activating factor, mast cell granule-derived mediators and neutrophils. Endogenous nitric oxide and supplementation with L-arginine has a protective role, reducing the lesions and preventing mortality. These results contributed to elucidate mechanisms involved in intestinal lesions which could be of relevance to human small bowel injury associated to allergy. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Abstract Background Prostate cancer {{involving}} the rectal wall is rare and {{may lead to}} diagnostic pitfalls. Case presentation Out of 9504 patients with rectal tumors between January 2003 and January 2015, 9 patients (elderly {{with a mean age}} of 740 years) with prostate cancer {{involving the}} rectal wall were clinically misdiagnosed with rectal cancer. The lesions were located in the rectum, and included 3 circumferential <b>rectal</b> masses, 1 <b>ulceration</b> lesion, 1 crater-like mass, and 4 protruding lesions. Specimens were acquired using biopsy, fine needle aspiration, or resection. The initial symptoms of these patients included rectal urgency, bowel obstruction, and lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Prostate-related symptoms were not obvious. Histologically, 2 cases showed cancer cell invasion in the mucosa, 1 showed transmural invasion from the mucosa to subserosal soft tissues, and 7 cases had submucosa and muscularis propria involvement. All the 9 cases had muscularis propria involvement. However, there were no intraepithelial neoplasias in the mucosal layer, which is reminiscent of rectal carcinoma. The tumors consisted of small-sized or foamy cells that formed acinus-like, duct-like, and cribriform-like structures. We conducted histological staining and an immunohistochemical analysis for CDX- 2, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), P 504 s, villin, carcinoembryonic antigen, CK-pan, cytokeratin 20, and Ki- 67. All tumors were PSA and CK-pan positive, 5 of 9 tumors were P 504 s-positive, and all tumors were negative for the other markers. All patients underwent standard therapy for prostate cancer after the definitive pathological diagnosis. As of March 31, 2015, 8 patients were alive and 1 had died of prostate cancer 60 months posttreatment. Conclusions Adenocarcinoma appearing in the rectal wall is not always rectal carcinoma. It is necessary to perform a differential diagnosis for prostate cancer in cases of rectal malignant tumors in elderly male patients. Any treatment should be postponed until the final definitive diagnosis is reached...|$|R
