5|$|I find {{it quite}} nerve-racking {{performing}}, actually. Because {{when you write}} songs, you don't <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> performing in a video. I think it's quite fun.

500|$|Probably in {{many respects}} most of the songs [...] are [...] But in more of an {{unconscious}} way. I don't <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> telling personal stories when I'm writing music. It just comes.

[...] But that's when I play the song for lots of people and they all go, 'Oh, I can totally relate to that'. In 'Miles Away' I'm tapping into the global consciousness of people who have intimacy problems.|$|E
500|$|Kishimoto {{inserted}} villains {{into the}} story to counteract the lead characters' moral values. He stated that this focus on illustrating the difference in values is central to his creation of villains to the point that, [...] "I don't <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> them in combat". The villains' physical appearances were also embellished to differentiate them from other characters, {{making it easier for}} a reader to follow the story and identify the villains, even in heated battle scenes. Kishimoto noted that making the villains [...] "flamboyant" [...] with a [...] "showy costume" [...] is [...] "one of my guiding principles", as well as making them [...] "more memorable".|$|E

[...] As a child, Bolt attended Waldensia Primary, where he first began to show his sprinting potential, running in the annual national primary-schools' meeting for his parish.

500|$|Wright's main {{influence}} was jazz, particularly Miles Davis and John Coltrane. He never considered himself a typical songwriter, preferring to create whole albums of {{music with a}} theme, later saying [...] "if {{the words came out}} like the music, and we didn't have anything else to do, then quite a few would be written". A number of compositions credited to Wright came out of improvisation and randomly trying ideas, some of which were picked up enthusiastically by his band mates. Wright later said [...] "I just play and don't <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> what I'm doing, I just let it happen". Of all the Pink Floyd members, Wright was the most reserved, sitting down behind the keyboards and concentrating on the music.|$|E
500|$|Yeah, I {{really felt}} {{at that point}} she was pretty strung out. Her whole world was rocked. She never thought she could get {{pregnant}} {{and then all of}} a sudden she's carrying this child and she's experiencing this soul for the first time in four hundred years. [...] the realisation that as soon as the baby's born the soul's going to go away, and it's the first time she really experienced true love, so she was going through a lot emotionally. I just didn't think that she would have time to <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> how she looked. I don't think it was a priority, and so for me as an actor it was important that I reveal that. Not get caught up in my own vanity as an actress, and portray the character as where she really was.|$|E
500|$|The period {{following}} Enema of the State saw {{the band}} experience great transition. [...] "We {{had gone from}} playing small clubs and sleeping on people's floors to headlining amphitheaters and staying in five-star hotels," [...] recalled Hoppus in 2013. [...] "After years of hard work, promotion, and nonstop touring, people knew who we were, and listened to what we were saying... it scared {{the shit out of}} us." [...] The band was rushed into recording the follow-up, as according to DeLonge, [...] "the president of MCA was penalizing us an obscene amount of money because our record wasn't going to be out in time for them to make their quarterly revenue statements. [...] And we were saying, 'Hey, we can't do this right now, we need to reorganize ourselves and <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> {{what we want to do}} and write the best record we can.'

6000|$|This (need I say it?) made me {{determined}} {{to see the}} letter.

Tanner Stransky, also of Entertainment Weekly, said of Yang's actions after Owen's affair: [...] "It alternately seems silly and not silly, when you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it."

Smith argued that he was forced down below the yellow line: [...] "I was always told that the rule is if you get forced down there, then you are {{the winner of the}} race, and on the last lap, anything goes.

500|$|While She Sleeps are {{generally}} recognized by professional reviewers as a metallic hardcore band and {{are known for}} their high energy and edgy sound. The recording features technical guitar picking, big riffs, heavy bass lines, crashing drums and screaming vocals. When questioned about their sound, Welsh described the band as having a [...] "raw UK vibe," [...] adding that they like to keep their music simple and have [...] "more a party vibe." [...] Vocalist Taylor added that their sound is [...] "less pure solo and just more energy." [...] Dom Wyatt of Dead Press! suggested that the band stick to the mould of a metalcore band with the adage [...] "don’t fix what isn’t broken."

Explaining that being from the North of England; the people that the band know [...] "won't take crap" [...] while also stating that the title means that it doesn't matter where you're from (geographically) you can still [...] "get involved" [...] with the band's music. Guitarist Welsh added that the title reflects the UK underground scene and how people will go to see a local band who are their friends and leave before seeing other bands– saying that [...] "that's not the way it should be." [...] In an interview in 2011, Welsh explained that the lyrics on [...] "My Conscience, Your Freedom" [...] are about the government– specifically noting on the line [...] "our coins can pay for the crime."

But that's when I play the song for lots of people and they all go, 'Oh, I can totally relate to that.'" [...] "Candy Shop" [...] is the opening track of the album. Produced by Williams, the song uses the word candy as a metaphor for sex. Williams said, [...] "We were just in a studio, [...] and [...] was like, 'Look, give me some hot shit.' I was looking at her like, 'She's saying hot shit?' She was like, 'What?' And I'm like, 'OK.' So we just worked and made it." [...] The first single from the album, [...] "4 Minutes", was initially known as [...] "4 Minutes to Save the World". The song's development was motivated by a sense of urgency to save the planet from destruction, and how people can enjoy themselves in the process. According to Madonna, the song inspired her to produce the documentary I Am Because We Are. The song features vocals by Timberlake and Timbaland. An uptempo dance song with an urban, hip hop style, it also incorporates Timbaland's bhangra beats. The instrumentation used in the song includes brass, foghorns and cow bells. The song's lyrics carry a message of social awareness, inspired by Madonna's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed.|$|E

He expressed his gratitude by saying: [...] "Words really can’t express my feelings. It's something you dream of as a kid growing up, but you can never foresee those childhood fantasies becoming reality.

[...] Corgan explained that he began to take the actions of others personally; he said, [...] "If you <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it, of course, someone doesn't do the job because they're lazy, or they don't think it's important.

2500|$|Chibnall was {{determined}} {{to ensure that the}} identity of the killer did not leak until the final episode aired. One reason for the secrecy was obviously commercial, for it kept viewers watching. But Chibnall also believed it would enhance the acting. [...] "There was a number of reasons for it, one of which was obviously {{that a lot of the}} story was driven from characters in the show not knowing, so it enables those characters to behave truthfully in that situation. And also what I wanted was for every performer to slightly suspect their character, and to <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> that, and to suspect each other. ... So what you get is ambiguity, and what it also means is that any of the performer or performers who are responsible for what happened aren't flagging it or signaling it in any way whatsoever." [...] The producers discussed the need for secrecy at length during pre-production and agreed it was essential. Chibnall also discussed secrecy issues with directors James Strong and Euros Lyn, and they both agreed to its necessity before coming aboard the project. As roles were cast, Chibnall also explained to each actor that the killer's identity would be kept from them until near the end of the production.|$|E

The ship has a pair of centrifugal-gravity-gen modules for the crew who remain awake for the duration, which has become a pretty typical feature of quasi-realistic ship designs in movies. But one unique feature it has which directly relates to the sub-light realistic travel is a cascade-style shield stack to protect the speeding craft from interstellar debris.
