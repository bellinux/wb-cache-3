40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the challenges faced by remote, rural and <b>regional</b> <b>airports</b> in Australia. The deregulation of airports over the past decades has resulted in local councils owning most of the rural and <b>regional</b> <b>airports</b> across Australia. The paper {{provides an}} overview of the international literature on <b>regional</b> <b>airports</b> and research directed at defining the issues faced by <b>regional</b> and rural <b>airports</b> in Australia. A survey of airport managers, regulators and local councils was undertaken across Australia to outline the challenges and stresses that <b>regional</b> <b>airports</b> are facing. Core findings indicate that the operation of rural and <b>regional</b> <b>airports</b> is under stress due to the interrelating factors of infrastructure costs, high cost of maintenance, and security infrastructure upgrades. Small airports often compete with one another to attract airlines and maintain their infrastructure advantage...|$|R

40|$|Although {{airports}} play {{an important}} role the global and European economies, according to the new guidelines of the EU Commission on the new state aid rules for a competitive aviation industry (EC, 2014), it will be more difficult for unprofitable airports, to get financial public subsidies in the future. The Commission noted that the majority of <b>regional</b> <b>airports</b> experience severe problems to cover their operative costs, resulting from among other things from overlapping of airports’ catchment areas. The main objective of the above mentioned measures is not to close the <b>regional</b> <b>airports,</b> but to motivate them to operate on cost efficient, profitable and more flexible basis, stating however that and that the most inefficient airports will be still closed. In order face upcoming challenges, the <b>regional</b> <b>airports</b> shall reconsider their future development plans. Traditionally, the airports including small and <b>regional</b> <b>airports</b> focus on the passenger traffic and thus, the possible benefits and opportunities of the air cargo market are totally underestimated or even completely ignored. Most <b>regional</b> <b>airports</b> in the Baltic Sea region act totally isolated and do not have a clear picture of the current situation on the international air cargo market today, its future perspectives and sustainable development plans remain basically hidden. There are some examples when trying to meet the market demand, the <b>regional</b> <b>airports</b> have made huge, but unfortunately unjustified investments, e. g. improving airport infrastructure, runways, etc. However, the airports’ infrastructural investments alone cannot fulfil the expected “remedy” role for the airports’ sustainability. This paper aims at investigating the positioning {{and the role of the}} <b>regional</b> <b>airports</b> in the current hub-and-spoke network, focusing on the relevance and potential of the air cargo sector for the <b>regional</b> <b>airports</b> development. The optional freight value proposition for the development of the <b>regional</b> <b>airports</b> and their possible participation in the air cargo market as a supplement instrument to generate additional revenue also by means of so-called “air trucking” services will be presented and discussed...|$|R
30|$|The <b>regional</b> <b>airports</b> had, {{according}} to Avinor, an average deficit amounting to about NOK 15.5 million in 2009. In 2006 the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) issued directives for Norwegian airports aimed at preventing {{and reducing the}} extent of accidents in the aviation industry. These regulations (BSL E 3 - 2) were adopted for <b>regional</b> <b>airports</b> by The Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communication (MTC) [16]. Avinor estimates that the total investment cost for the <b>regional</b> <b>airports</b> of meeting the new requirements amounts to NOK 1.7 billion.|$|R

30|$|The Norwegian {{network of}} <b>regional</b> <b>airports</b> was {{established}} {{at the end of}} the 1960 ’s and during the 1970 ’s and has remained virtually unchanged since construction. Over the same four decades, travel time by car between cities holding <b>regional</b> <b>airports</b> has been considerably reduced due to infrastructure investment in roads, bridges, tunnels and ferry connections. A case in point is the Helgeland region in Norway where travel time by road between the three <b>regional</b> <b>airports</b> has been reduced by more than 30 % from 1967 to 2009.|$|R
