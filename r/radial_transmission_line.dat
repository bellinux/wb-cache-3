In this design, many individual energy storage units (bricks), each composed of two capacitors and one switch, directly drive the target load without additional pulse compression. Ten LTD modules in parallel drive the load. Each module consists of 16 LTD cavities connected in series, where each cavity is powered by 22 bricks connected in parallel.

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach for}} estimating {{the locations of}} <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> faults has been to measure the apparent impedance from a line terminal to the fault and to convert the reactive component of the impedance to line length. Several methods, that use voltages and currents measured at one or both line terminals, have been proposed in the past. Methods for locating faults on <b>radial</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>lines</b> and rural distribution feeders have also been suggested. These methods do not adequately address {{the problems associated with}} fault location on distribution systems that have single or multiphase laterals and/or tapped loads. A technique that estimates the location of a shunt fault on a radial distribution system that has several single and/or multiphase laterals has been developed. Load taps and non-homogeneity of the system are taken into account. The apparent location of a fault is first estimated by computing the impedance from the fundamental frequency voltage and current phasors, and converting the reactive component of the impedance to line length. The sequence voltages and currents at the fault are expressed as functions of the distance to the fault as well as the impedances of loads beyond the fault. The expression for the imaginary component of the fault impedance is equated to zero and the resulting equation is solved using an iterative approach. Multiple estimates may be obtained for a fault in a distribution system that has laterals. One of the estimates is identified as the most likely fault location by using information from fault indicators which are strategically placed on the laterals. The developed technique, which can handle single-phase-to-ground, two-phase-to-ground, phase-to-phase and balanced three-phase faults was tested to evaluate its suitability. Results from computer simulations of faults indicate that the proposed technique is more accurate than the reactive component method. Studies also demonstrate that the sensitivity of the proposed technique is comparable to that of the reactive component method. A prototype fault location system was also developed. The system was tested using simulated voltage and current waveforms. Results show a close agreement with those obtained from the non-real time tests...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a theoretical analysis model and a design procedure to synthesize aperture coupled microstrip patch arrays using a radial line feed. As a first topic, a lossy <b>radial</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> model is developed to predict slot coupling. With the reciprocity technique and a moment method analysis, key design parameters for realizing a radial line slot array are modeled to formulate the slot coupling problem. By applying the sequential array technique for circular polarization to radial line slot array design, good performance is found for both axial ratio and return loss bandwidth. The aperture efficiency degradation of a sequential array having elliptically polarized elements is investigated by evaluating the gain versus element spacing and polarization ellipticity. A sample design for a 18 cm aperture diameter radial line slot array with 42 % aperture efficiency validates these theoretical approaches. Next, an aperture coupled microstrip patch array with a radial line feed is analyzed by modifying the analysis model of the radial line slot array. By using linearly polarized aperture coupled patches as radiating elements, sampled designs of aperture coupled microstrip patch arrays using radial line feeds are used to demonstrate the feasibility of this new structure. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We have {{developed}} algorithms for designing disk-loaded travelling-wave output structures for X-band klystrons {{to be used}} in the SLAC NLC. We use either a four- or five-cell structure in a π/ 2 mode. The disk radii are tapered to produce an approximately constant gradient. The matching calculation is not performed on the tapered structure, but rather on a coupler whose input and output cells are the same as the final cell of the tapered structure, and whose interior cells are the same as the penultimate cell in the tapered structure. 2 -D calculations using CONDOR model the waveguide as a <b>radial</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> of adjustable impedance. 3 -D calculations with MAFIA model the actual rectangular waveguide and coupling slot. A good match is obtained by adjusting the impedance of the final cell. In 3 -D, this requires varying both the radius of the cell and the width of the aperture. When the output cell with the best match is inserted in the tapered structure, we obtain excellent cold-test agreement between the 2 -D and 3 -D models.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a conceptual design of a next-generation pulsed-power accelerator that is optimized for megajoule-class dynamic-material-physics experiments. Sufficient electrical energy is delivered by the accelerator to a physics load to achieve—within centimeter-scale samples—material pressures as high as 1  TPa. The accelerator design {{is based on an}} architecture that is founded on three concepts: single-stage electrical-pulse compression, impedance matching, and transit-time-isolated drive circuits. The prime power source of the accelerator consists of 600 independent impedance-matched Marx generators. Each Marx comprises eight 5. 8 -GW bricks connected electrically in series, and generates a 100 -ns 46 -GW electrical-power pulse. A 450 -ns-long water-insulated coaxial-transmission-line impedance transformer transports the power generated by each Marx to a system of twelve 2. 5 -m-radius water-insulated conical transmission lines. The conical lines are connected electrically in parallel at a 66 -cm radius by a water-insulated 45 -post sextuple-post-hole convolute. The convolute sums the electrical currents at the outputs of the conical lines, and delivers the combined current to a single solid-dielectric-insulated <b>radial</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line.</b> The radial line in turn transmits the combined current to the load. Since much of the accelerator is water insulated, we refer to it as Neptune. Neptune is 40  m in diameter, stores 4. 8  MJ of electrical energy in its Marx capacitors, and generates 28  TW of peak electrical power.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to explain {{numerous}} atmospheric electrical phenomena, {{the elements of the}} global electrical circuit are reexamined. In addition to being a 'quasi-static 'DC' generator' and source of radiated energy at VLF and higher, the thunderstorm is found to be a pulse generator, with most of the external energy contained in ELF and ULF pulse currents to the ionosphere (and Earth). The pulse energy is found to deposit largely in the middle atmosphere above the thunderstorm. The VLF and above components are well understood, as are the ULF components due to the conductivity gradient. However, a previously poorly understood ELF component on the millsecond timescale, or 'slow tail,' contains a large fraction of the electrical energy. This component couples strongly to the ionosphere and also launches a unipolar transverse electromagnetic (TEM) wavelet in the <b>radial</b> Earth-ionosphere <b>transmission</b> <b>line.</b> The increase in charge with distance associated with such wavelets, and their ensemble sum at a point, may explain some large mesospheric 'DC' fields but there are still difficulties explaining other than rare occurrences, except for antipodal reconvergence.

The mathematical equations which model a Voltage-Source Converter (VSC) are nonlinear (bilinear) because the system inputs are multiplied by a state-variable. The high performance characteristics for their operation must be designed {{in the face of}} the nonlinearity. This thesis applies a Nonlinear Control Method which makes use of a nonlinear transformation to obtain a system of linear equations. Then linear state feedback is used to move the eigenvalues of the linear system to achieve fast, stable response. The Nonlinear Control Method has been applied successfully to 3 FACTS controllers: (1) the single VSC SSSC (system order N = 3); (2) the 2 -VSC UPFC (N = 5); and (3) the 3 -VSC Center-node Unified Power Flow Controller (C-UPFC, N = 5). The key to success is in finding the nonlinear transformation equations which is an art as in all integration efforts and which cannot be taught as in differentiation. Having found the nonlinear transformation equations for the 3 FACTS controllers, they can be extended to the entire family of Voltage-Source Converter based FACTS controllers. A Simplified Nonlinear Control Method, which does not sacrifice mathematical rigour, is proposed. As the Simplified Nonlinear Control Method does not require knowledge in advanced control theory, it facilitates adoption of the Nonlinear Control Method by the power electronics community.

40|$|This project {{deals with}} voltage source {{converters}} with energy storage capability. The main {{objective is to}} study the possible benefits of energy storage to a power system with a VSC as the interface between them. First of all, a converter control system is proposed for a two level VSC. In the conventional converter control, the control system usually takes the voltage measured {{at the point where}} the converter is connected and calculates the reference voltage for the converter; with a modulation system the converter then produces the required 'average voltage'. In this project, a novel flux modulation scheme, combined with the deadbeat current control strategy, is proposed. The current controller is capable of controlling both positive and negative sequence current components. With flux modulation, the control system measures the bus flux and commands the converter to generate the required flux. Based on the proposed control strategies, several application studies have been carried out. The first application study investigates the effect of energy storage on the power quality at the point of common coupling when a system is subject to load disturbances. The voltage at PCC in a weak network is very sensitive to load changes. A sudden change in active load will cause both a phase jump and a magnitude fluctuation in the bus voltage, whereas reactive load changes mainly affect the voltage magnitude. With the addition of energy storage to a StatCom, it is possible to compensate for the active power change as well as providing reactive power support. In this thesis, some effective active power compensation schemes are proposed. Simulations and experiments have been performed to verify the compensation schemes. The results show that a StatCom with energy storage can significantly reduce phase jumps and magnitude deviations of the bus voltage. pact of the energy storage on the performance of weak systems under fault conditions has been investigated. The investigation was done by studying an example system. The system model was established based on a real system, in which some induction motors driving pumps along a pipeline are fed from a <b>radial</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line.</b> Studies show that for a weak system with induction motor loads, a StatCom with certain energy storage capacity will effectively improve the system recovery after faults. Although this incurs extra cost for the increasing dc voltage rating and size of the dc side capacitor, the overall rating of the converter can be reduced by utilization of the proposed active power compensation scheme. The last case study investigates the possible use of a StatCom with energy storage to improve the power quality at the point of common coupling where a cyclic load is connected. Studies show that by providing both fast reactive and fast active power support to the network, not only the voltage magnitude can be well controlled, but also the voltage phase jump can be reduced significantly.

The high electrical conductivity of copper minimizes penetration of magnetic flux into the cavity walls, which minimizes changes in the sensitivity of the sensors on the 100 -ns time scale of the accelerator’s power pulse. A model of flux penetration has been developed and is used to correct (to first order) the B-dot signals for the penetration that does occur. The two sensors are designed to produce signals with opposite polarities; hence, each current monitor may be regarded as a single detector with differential outputs. Common-mode-noise rejection is achieved by combining these signals in a 50 -Ω balun. The signal cables that connect the B-dot monitors to the balun are chosen to provide reasonable bandwidth and acceptable levels of Compton drive in the bremsstrahlung field of the accelerator. A single 50 -Ω cable transmits the output signal of each balun to a double-wall screen room, where the signals are attenuated, digitized (0. 5 -ns/sample), numerically compensated for cable losses, and numerically integrated. By contrast, each inner-MITL current monitor contains only a single B-dot sensor. These monitors are fielded in opposite-polarity pairs. The two signals from a pair are not combined in a balun; they are instead numerically processed for common-mode-noise rejection after digitization. All the current monitors are calibrated on a 76 -cm-diameter axisymmetric <b>radial</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> that is driven by a 10 -kA current pulse. The reference current is measured by a current-viewing resistor (CVR). The stack voltage monitors are also differential-output gauges, consisting of one 1. 8 -cm-diameter D-dot sensor and one null sensor. Hence, each voltage monitor is also a differential detector with two output signals, processed as described above. The voltage monitors are calibrated in situ at 1. 5  MV on dedicated accelerator shots with a short-circuit load. Faraday’s law of induction is used to generate the reference voltage: currents are obtained from calibrated outer-MITL B-dot monitors, and inductances from the system geometry. In this way, both current and voltage measurements are traceable to a single CVR. Dependable and consistent measurements are thus obtained with this system of calibrated diagnostics. On accelerator shots that deliver 22  MA to a low-impedance z-pinch load, the peak lineal current densities at the stack, outer-MITL, and inner-MITL monitor locations are 0. 5, 1, and 58 [*][*]MA/m, respectively. On such shots the peak currents measured at these three locations agree to within 1 %...|$|E

The <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> consists of a cable header, load protection switch, and tri-plate assembly interfacing to the center transition section. The cable header interface to the Marx module provides a mechanism to remove the Marx module for maintenance without removing other components of the <b>transmission</b> <b>line.</b> The load protection switch provides a mechanism for protecting the load during charging of the Marx {{in the event of}} a pre-fire condition. The aluminum tri-plate is a low-inductance <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> carries <b>radial</b> current flow from the Marx energy storage system at the machine periphery toward the load. All <b>transmission</b> <b>line</b> components are oil insulated except the solid-dielectric insulated power flow channel connected directly to the load. The transition region at the machine center consists of several components that enable the <b>radial</b> converging vertical <b>transmission</b> <b>lines</b> to interface to a horizontal disk/conical power flow channel delivering current to the load. The current carrying transition components include the high-voltage and ground conductors interfacing to the tri-plate <b>transmission</b> <b>lines.</b> The tri-plate tank attachment ring interfaces to the tri-plate tanks and the base-plate. The base-plate supports the transition components and interfaces to the center support structure of the machine. The bottom insulator also attaches to the base-plate and to the high-voltage conductor, providing an oil containment seal between the transition and vacuum vessel. Design has been completed for all Atlas components. Some prototype hardware fabrication has been completed and first article hardware is in various stages of completion. The first article is a single line of the machine and includes a Marx module, cable header, load protection switch, tri-plate <b>transmission</b> <b>line,</b> and a dump load for testing. Testing is in progress on some prototype and first article components to verify performance before production begins on critical system components. Production will soon begin for much of the overall system, including the Marx tanks, tri-plate tanks, support structure, some transition components, and the personnel platform. These components will be fabricated and installed while the remaining internal components are being fabricated...|$|R
