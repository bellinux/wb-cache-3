Collection of data was performed on a commercial dairy farm and milking {{took place in a}} <b>rotary</b> <b>milking</b> <b>parlour.</b> Between February and December 1998 1, 090, 031 observations from 2, 422 Holstein Friesian cows were accumulated. Around 30 % of cows were milked thrice daily. For each trait and each cow a daily value was calculated. The fixed effects test day, parity, calving season, milking frequency, week of lactation and the random effect cow were considered in statistical analyses. With increasing number of parity, activity decreased and milk yield, milk flow rate and electrical conductivity increased. The milking frequency had significant influence on all analysed traits and for the effect calving season no consistent trend was found. All traits showed characteristic patterns during lactation. Between test days high variations were found for the trait activity. The remaining traits showed a steady level except for small fluctuations. Repeatability was 27. 4 % for activity and between 70 and 78. 7 % for the milk parameters. The repeatabilities verified the collected field data having a satisfying structure for application in automatic oestrus detection. The repeatability of the trait activity indicated high differences between and within cows. The right skewed distribution indicated the activity as a promising trait for further analyses...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the factors that affect the system performance of a threedimensional based vision system for automatic monitoring of dairy cow locomotion implemented on a commercial dairy farm. Data were gathered from a Belgian commercial dairy farm with a 40 -stand <b>rotary</b> <b>milking</b> <b>parlour.</b> This resulted in forced cow traffic twice a day when all Holstein cows passed through an alley on their return to the pen. The video recording system with a 3 D depth camera, positioned in top-down perspective, was installed in this alley. The entire monitoring process, including video recording, filtering and analysis and cow identification, was automated. System performance was defined as the number of analysed videos per session. To investigate how many video recordings could be used for monitoring dairy cow locomotion, videos were captured during 566 consecutive milking sessions. For each session, 224 ± 10 cows were identified on average by the RFID-antenna, and 197 ± 17 videos were recorded (88. 0 ± 6. 2 %) by the camera. After linking the cow identification to the recorded videos, 178 ± 14 cow videos (79. 5 ± 5. 7 %) were available for analysis. After all video processing, an average of 110 ± 24 recorded cow videos (49. 3 ± 11. 0 %) per session was used for analysis. The number of analysed videos per cow per week was individually variable. Cow traffic in the alley where the recordings were made had a big influence on the performance of the system. Heavy cow traffic reduced the number of recordings and the number of identified cows in each video, and more videos were filtered out due to incorrect cow segmentation in the videos. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Technological {{advances}} {{now make}} it possible to continuously record and monitor a range of outcomes on dairy farms including individual cow milk yields, environmental temperature and rainfall. These facilities enhance the ability of herd managers to recognise deviations from what is accepted as normal, prompting timely corrective intervention. The objective of this thesis is to demonstrate how liveweights recorded using walkover weighing (WoW) technology can provide information {{that can be used to}} better-manage a range of activities on dairy farms, particularly reproduction and herd health. Analysis of daily WoW recorded over the first 100 days of lactation have shown that the standard deviation of daily LW measurements across parities was 17 kg on average. A near perfect association between liveweights measured statically and WoWs (concordance correlation coefficient 0. 99, 95 % CI 0. 99 to 1. 0) was observed. After controlling for the effect of liveweight at calving and long term liveweight change using a mixed-effects linear regression model, the autocorrelation between WoWs recorded on successive days was 0. 21, decaying to zero by eight days. This study showed that by using a standalone automatic WoW system positioned in the exit race of a <b>rotary</b> <b>milking</b> <b>parlour,</b> it was possible to record LWs of individual cows on a daily basis and, with controlled cow flow over the weighing platform (allowing for sufficient succession distance to prevent congestion), results were similar to those recorded using conventional, static weighing techniques. Two observational studies were conducted to investigate the relationships between LW, LWchange (LW) and clinical lameness. In the first study, LW loss in the first 50 days in milk increased the risk of a lameness event being diagnosed after 50 days in milk by a factor of 1. 80 (95 % CI 1. 00 to 3. 17). The risk of lameness was greatest for high yielding cows that lost excessive LW (risk ratio 4. 36, 95 % CI 4. 21 to 8. 19). The second study quantified LW immediately before and after the diagnosis of lameness events. For lame cows, liveweight decreased up to three weeks before the date of diagnosis and for up to four weeks after. The total liveweight loss arising from a single lameness episode was, on average, 61 kg (95 % CI 47 to 74 kg). The results of this study show how liveweight records for individual animals can be used to enhance a herd manager’s ability to detect lame cows and present them for treatment. Prompt detection and treatment of lame cows presents an opportunity to shorten recovery times, with positive follow-on effects in terms of animal welfare. LW was assessed as a means for enahancing the sensitivity and specificity of oestrus detection. The sensitivity and specificity of detecting true oestrus events using LW combined with tail paint and visual observation was 0. 86 and 0. 94, respectively. The effect of LW in the first four weeks after calving (LWlong) and LW change around the time of the Planned Start of Mating (LWshort) on the time taken for cows to conceive relative to the Planned Start of Mating was quantified. Planned Start of Mating to conception intervals were influenced by LW change during both of these periods, though LWshort had a greater effect compared with LWlong. The findings of this study better define the impact of long- and short-term liveweight change on reproductive performance, providing the opportunity to design feeding programmes in pasture fed dairy herds that have positive effects on fertility. The studies presented in this thesis contribute knowledge to the role of LWmonitoring as a tool to better-manage seasonally calving, pasture fed dairy herds. While ‘traditional’ usage of walkover scales on dairy farms has involved the recording of LWand LWchange as a means for monitoring and adapting changes to the herd feeding program, the studies presented here have shown how LW records have the potential to provide information that can be used to better manage a range of herd level activities, particularly those related to reproductive management and health...|$|E

The main factors investigated are the times required for cow movements, milking processes and robot motions. With one robot serving two stalls, the idle time of the robot arm was 54 %. From an analysis of the milking cycle, it is shown that the robot arm can serve up to four milking stalls in-line. The model showed also that the capacity of an automatic milking system with two stalls in-line, can be increased from 11 · 7 to nearly 15 · 4 cows h h- 1 by increasing the robot speed, by executing some milking processes simultaneously and by changing the sequence of milking processes. If the robot is available for milking for 20 h, 308 milkings could be carried out. Thus, with a milking frequency of four milkings per cow per 24 h for the whole herd, the milking robot could serve nearly 80 cows.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluated}} fertility and milk performance due to multiple milking technology which was used. The monitoring was carried in 2011 in farms Agrospol, Malý Bor a. s. and the farm Dub. System evaluation of fertility and milk performance of dairy cows at multiple milking were evaluated in 186 lactations of Czech pied cattle breeding. The average number of <b>milking</b> in the <b>parlour</b> was 2. 96 x/day and robot 2. 36 x/day. 107 lactations were obtained during milking in the <b>milking</b> <b>parlour</b> and 79 of lactation during milking by robots. In this thesis were measured indicators of fertility (insemination interval, service period, the mean time and age at first calving) and indicators of milk production (lactation length, the amount of milk fat, protein and lactose content). In the reproductive indicators were taken statistically highly difference in age at first calving, where the average difference was 195 days. For other indicators of fertility were all statistically significant results in favor of milking in the <b>milking</b> <b>parlour</b> (2. 96 x/day). Czech pied cattle milked in the <b>milking</b> <b>parlour</b> per normative lactation average amount of milk produced 8 599. 8 kg, cows milked by robot 7 272. 5 kg.

On Farm 2, three primiparous, 16 secondiparous and 36 multiparous cows (range 1 – 8) constituted group F 2 G 1; whereas group F 2 G 2 had 12 primiparous, 10 secondiparous and 14 multiparous cows (range 1 – 10). Animals were milked in auto-tandem <b>milking</b> <b>parlours</b> (2 × 5 and 2 × 6 for Farms 1 and 2, respectively). For each cow, entrance order into <b>milking</b> <b>parlour,</b> side where she was milked, milk yield, time and duration of milking were recorded. These data were derived from the computerised identification of cows. The sequence in which the cows entered themilking parlour ranged from 1 to 57 for group F 1, from 1 to 55 for group F 2 G 1 and from 1 to 36 for group F 2 G 2. The analysis of data was conducted on 130, 120 and 92 consecutive milkings for groups F 1, F 2 G 1 and F 2 G 2, respectively.

40|$|The {{fieldwork}} for my {{doctoral degree}} {{was carried out}} over nineteen months, a year of which was spent working on an industrial dairy farm in Hokkaido, Japan 2 ̆ 7 s northernmost Island. As {{in much of the}} industrialised world, dairy farming in Japan is rapidly changing. Many farmers are forced by neo-liberal agricultural policies to shift from small family operated farms to high-tech, high-speed, and high overhead industrial operations. This paper focuses on the history of dairy farming in the Tokachi region; more specifically one farm and the shift over a generation to a <b>rotary</b> <b>parlour</b> <b>milking</b> system. It addresses the linkages this mode of production has cultivated amongst humans, dairy cows and industrialized space. The parlour system at Great Hopes Farm allows five workers (aided by three more stall staff) to milk over 1000 cows, fifty at a time, three times a day. The impetus behind moving to parlour technology is that it increases productivity through mechanically enhanced observation and control. However this recent mechanical separation of human and cow during the milking process has led to affectively shared interspecies and inter-human alienation. The technology of the parlour system sets daily rhythms for bovine and human alike, and separates both from a process formerly dependent upon, specialized knowledge, affective empathy, and embodied knowledge. Human and bovine experience the systemic violence of the machine and what remains is a complex bio-politics of interspecies affect and the separation of “bare” and “political” life...|$|R
