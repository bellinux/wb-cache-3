The algebras of Kleinian type are finite {{dimensional}} semisimple rational algebras A {{such that}} the group of units of an order in A is commensurable with a direct product of Kleinian groups.

The study of Kleinian groups {{goes back to the}} works of Poincaré [Poi] and Bianchi [Bia] and it has been an active field of research ever since. In the last decades, it is strongly related to the Geometrization Program of Thurston for the classification of 3 -manifolds [EGM, MR, Mas, Thu]. The use of the methods of Kleinian groups {{to the study of the}} groups of units of group rings was started in [PRR] and led to the notion of algebras of Kleinian type and finite groups of Kleinian type. Let K be a number field, A a central simple K-algebra and R a Z-order in A. Let R 1 denote the group of units of R of reduced norm 1. Every embedding σ: K → C induces an embedding σ: A → Md(C), where d is the degree of A. Furthermore, σ(R 1) ⊆ SLd(C). We say that A is of Kleinian type if either A = K or A is a quaternion algebra over K and σ(R 1) is a discrete subgroup of SL 2 (C) for some embedding σ of K in C.

In this preprint we construct a ring homomorphism from the mod 2 Milnor K-theory k * (F) to the graded <b>ring</b> gr <b>R(G,</b> k) associated to Grothendieck's γ-filtration. We study this map in particular cases, {{as well as}} a related map involving the W-group G of F, rather than G. The latter is an isomorphism in all cases considered. Naturally this echoes the Milnor conjecture (now a theorem), which states that k * (F) is isomorphic to the mod 2 cohomology of the absolute Galois group G, and to the graded Witt ring gr W (F). The machinery developed to obtain the above results seems to have independent interest in algebraic topology. We are led to construct an analog of the classical Chern character, which does not involve complex vector bundles and Chern classes but rather real vector bundles and Stiefel-Whitney classes. Thus we show the existence of a ring homomorphism whose source is the graded ring associated to the corresponding K-theory ring KO(X) of the topological space X, again with respect to the γ-filtration, and whose target is a certain subquotient of H * (X, F 2). In order to define this subquotient, we introduce a collection of distinguished Steenrod operations. They are related to Stiefel-Whitney classes by combinatorial identities...|$|R
