The steady flow begins to {{dissipate}} {{in certain areas}} as it approaches Camp Bullis in northern San Antonio, leaving dry patches that reveal a <b>rocky</b> <b>bottom.</b> Such dry patches continue as it heads east, forming the boundary between Bexar and Comal Counties.

25|$|Acanthicus is a genus of large, South American suckermouth armored {{catfishes}} {{native to}} the Amazon and Orinoco basins, and possibly in Guyana. The name Acanthicus {{is derived from the}} Greek, akanthikos meaning thorny, spiny. Fish of this genus are known as lyre-tail plecos. These species are found in large rivers, primarily in areas with a <b>rocky</b> <b>bottom</b> and a moderate or strong current.|$|E
25|$|Near {{the mouth}} of the Saint John River, where it passes through the city of Saint John, is the famous Reversing Falls. Here the {{changing}} tide causes alternating strong upriver and downriver flows several times a day as the tidal cycle changes. A narrow granite gorge and <b>rocky</b> <b>bottom</b> heavily restricts waterflow and creates strong rapids that flow upriver at high tide, and downriver at low tide.|$|E

500|$|Stalingrads hull was towed from Nikolayev on 19 May 1955 {{by three}} tugs, but was driven ashore by high winds on 23 May at the {{southern}} entrance to Sevastopol Bay. She grounded on a very <b>rocky</b> <b>bottom</b> in very shallow water only about [...] from shore. A number of the ordinary methods to refloat a ship couldn't be used because she was very nearly empty and so nothing could be off-loaded and the <b>rocky</b> <b>bottom</b> meant that it couldn't be excavated out from underneath her. The first attempt used brute force provided by the cruisers [...] and Kerch to unsuccessfully tow her off. Several other attempts were made using explosive charges to create shock waves that would pivot her stern into deeper water in combination with tugs attempting to pull her around, but these were counterproductive in that several holes were blown in her sides which flooded several compartments and grounded her that much more firmly. At this time a more detailed assessment {{was made of the}} situation and 259 steel projections were discovered on the underside of her hull, left over from her launching cradles. These ranged in length from [...] and totally invalidated all calculations about the amount of force required to free her.|$|E
500|$|The river Paraguay {{presents}} no important {{obstacles to}} navigation, the principal point to observe being the [...] {{rise of the}} water; this varies sometimes as much as three fathoms ... The danger attendant on grounding in the Paraguay is ... has a sharp <b>rocky</b> <b>bottom</b> ... The entrance to the Paraguay at Tres Bocas is [...] 500 yards wide, and at medium river there is a depth of twelve feet of water. The iron-clads of the Brazilian fleet, many of which drew twelve and thirteen feet of water, were entirely dependent on these periodical rises, both for forward movements, and also for retreat, if {{it should have been}} necessary. Their guns and ammunition were not shipped until they arrived at Corrientes; for the Paraná is equally shallow in various parts...|$|E
500|$|Strandzha is criss-crossed by a {{dense network}} of deep ravines, streams and rivers. The rivers have a {{discharge}} maximum in winter, in November – December. With a total length of , the Veleka river {{is the longest}} and largest in Strandzha. Its upper course has a <b>rocky</b> <b>bottom</b> and many rapids. As the river flows through the karstic region of the mountain, its banks are steep with cliffs and precipices. After the village of Zvezdets, the river valley grows wider, the inclination decreases, the water flow slows and the river creates many meanders. In the lower course the river banks are flooded seasonally forming a wetland forest of alluvial longose groves. The Veleka is navigable in the first [...] up from the river mouth.|$|E

2500|$|Redspotted {{catsharks}} feed on {{organisms that}} {{dwell on the}} <b>rocky</b> <b>bottom</b> near the continental shelf. Their primary food sources are various species of crabs and the rhynchocinetid rock shrimp Rhynchocinetes typus (Farina and Ojeda 1993) [...] They have also been known to eat fishes, algal material, and various polychaetes. Redspotted catsharks are an important predator within their ecosystem. They have a large influence on commercially fished benthic organisms that dwell in the rocky near-shore areas.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{variants}} of trawling gear. They {{vary according to}} local traditions, bottom conditions, and how large and powerful the trawling boats are. A trawling boat can be a small open boat with only 30horsepower or a large factory ship with 10,000horsepower. Trawl variants include beam trawls, large-opening midwater trawls, and large bottom trawls, such as [...] "rock hoppers" [...] that are rigged with heavy rubber wheels that let the net crawl over <b>rocky</b> <b>bottom.</b>|$|E

60|$|These {{had been}} got into readiness; {{it was not}} thought that they would get any hold on the <b>rocky</b> <b>bottom,</b> still they might catch on a {{projecting}} ledge, and at any rate their weight {{and that of the}} chain cable would relieve the strain upon the hawser.|$|E

60|$|With a cry {{the fellow}} threw his hands above his head, {{staggered}} forward and plunged full length upon his face. Barney gathered the princess {{in his arms}} and plunged into the shallow stream.

60|$|Old Peter now {{went down}} toward the woods, while I walked up the little stream. I had seen trout-brooks before, but never one so {{diminutive}} as this.

6000|$|But, {{on looking}} behind him, Bellerophon saw {{something}} that induced him first {{to draw the}} bridle, and then to turn Pegasus about.

In front, as far off as you could throw a stone, was the cavern's mouth, with the three smoke-wreaths oozing out of it. And what else did Bellerophon behold there? ...|$|E

60|$|An hour's steady march {{down the}} slopes brought {{the army to}} the edge of the marsh lands. These, as it chanced, proved no {{obstacle}} to our progress, for in that season of great drought they were quite dry, and for the same reason the shrunken river was not so impassable a defence as I feared that it would be. Still, because of its <b>rocky</b> <b>bottom</b> and steep, opposing banks, it looked formidable enough, while on the crests of those banks, in squadrons and companies of horse and foot, were gathered the regiments of Atene.|$|E
