The sacrament re-presents (makes present) the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross, and perpetuates it.

40|$|Recorded {{remittances}} to Africa {{have grown}} {{dramatically over the}} past decade. Yet data limitations still mean relatively {{little is known about}} which migrants <b>remit,</b> how much they <b>remit</b> and how their <b>remitting</b> behaviour varies with gender, education, income levels and duration abroad. This paper constructs the most comprehensive remittance database currently available on immigrants in the OECD, containing microdata on more than 12, 000 African immigrants. Using this microdata the authors establish several basic facts about the <b>remitting</b> patterns of Africans, and then explore how key characteristics of policy interest relate to remittance behaviour. Africans are found to <b>remit</b> twice as much on average as migrants from other developing countries, and those from poorer African countries are more likely to <b>remit</b> than those from richer African countries. Male migrants <b>remit</b> more than female migrants, particularly among those with a spouse remaining in the home country; more-educated migrants <b>remit</b> more than less educated migrants; and although the amount <b>remitted</b> increases with income earned, the gradient is quite flat over a large range of income. Finally, {{there is little evidence that}} the amount <b>remitted</b> decays with time spent abroad, with reductions in the likelihood of <b>remitting</b> offset by increases in the amount <b>remitted</b> conditional on <b>remitting.</b> Copyright 2010 The author 2010.

30|$|Finally, it is {{comforting to}} find that the figures in Tables  3 and 4 confirm {{well-known}} findings in the literature, such as the fact that men are more likely to <b>remit</b> and <b>remit</b> larger sums than women. This is often the result when men are the main breadwinners in their Mexican households. The <b>remitting</b> likelihood also rises with the migrant’s age, although at a decreasing rate. Additionally, we find evidence that more educated migrants are less likely to <b>remit</b> money home than their less educated counterparts. However, they are able to <b>remit</b> somewhat larger amounts when they do so, possibly due to their better employment and earnings outcomes in the United States. Indeed, higher monthly earnings are positively linked to larger remittance flows. To conclude, there is some evidence of how immigrants <b>remit</b> less as they become increasingly assimilated to the United States, perhaps form new families and assume new responsibilities in the host country. For instance, migrants’ propensity to <b>remit</b> declines with the length of their migration spell at an increasing rate. Similarly, English proficient migrants and those engaged in social organizations –often byproduct of longer migration experiences and greater assimilation, are less likely to <b>remit</b> and <b>remit</b> less if they send money to their families in Mexico.|$|R
30|$|The {{reasoning}} {{behind the}} use of these variables as identifying instruments now follows. Given that the objective is to measure how responsive the remittances of an individual sibling are to those of other siblings, the decision to <b>remit</b> should not be directly influenced by the characteristics of other siblings but rather by how much other siblings have <b>remitted.</b> For example, other siblings may <b>remit</b> more to the household because they have higher levels of education and/or live in a destination with higher income levels. Or, other siblings may be more educated and/or earn more and yet choose to <b>remit</b> less, if at all. However, the amount of money an individual sibling chooses to <b>remit</b> is not a function of the characteristics of other siblings per se but rather a response to how much the household of origin has received. Thus, it does not matter why other siblings are <b>remitting</b> at the level they are but rather how much they are <b>remitting.</b> The view here is that the actual amount <b>remitted</b> to the household of origin trumps any reason for siblings <b>remitting</b> (Antman op. cit.), hence the assumption that the behaviour of the individual responds to the remittance levels of other siblings and not directly to their characteristics.|$|R

There was delay upon their arrival, and Metternich spent the time travelling around Italy again; he visited Venice, Padua, Ferrara, Pisa, Florence and Lucca. Though alarmed by developments (he noted that many of Francis' concessions were still not in practice), he was optimistic and made another plea for decentralisation on 29 August. After this failed, Metternich decided to broaden his efforts into general administrative reform to avoid the appearance of favouring the Italians {{over the rest of}} the Empire. While working on this, he returned to Vienna on 12 September 1817 to be immediately caught up in the organisation of his daughter Maria's marriage to Count Joseph Esterházy just three days later. It proved too much, and Metternich was taken ill. After a delay for recovery, [...] Metternich condensed his proposals for Italy into three documents he submitted to Francis, all dated 27 October 1817. The administration would remain undemocratic, but there would be a new Ministry of Justice and four new chancellors—each with local <b>remits,</b> including one for [...] "Italy".

30|$|We {{find that}} {{increased}} immigration enforcement impacts migrants’ <b>remitting</b> patterns by severely restricting {{the share of}} undocumented immigrants sending money home. However, not all policies are created equal. What we refer to as police-based initiatives, i.e. 287 (g) agreements and Secure Communities, induce undocumented immigrants to start <b>remitting</b> money home, possibly as an insurance mechanism. However, they significantly curtail legal migrants’ <b>remitting</b> likelihood, conceivably through the greater financial responsibilities they now face following the deportation of family members in mixed-status households. In contrast, E-Verify mandates, possibly through their restrictions on undocumented migrants’ employment options, lower their propensity to <b>remit</b> money home, but have no statistically {{significant impact on the}} <b>remitting</b> likelihood of legal migrants.

40|$|Social science discourses on {{migration}} and development emphasize migrants' altruism or self-interest as {{the determinants of}} their <b>remitting</b> practices, which is countered by alternative explanations focusing on social culture and structure. Due to the dichotomy of structure/agency, the current approaches offer unsatisfactory explanations of migrants' <b>remitting</b> practices. This dissertation aims to proposes a corrective by developing an alternative model of understanding the determinants of migrants' <b>remitting</b> practices. It synthesizes three strands of social science literature and derive the conception of <b>remitting</b> as a collective social act. From a realist approach following Durkheim, it begins at the empirical manifestations of migrants' <b>remitting</b> practices, but looks at deeper levels of social reality (the actual and the real) in identifying the determinants. It focuses on the internal social relations between the individuals involved in the acts in question {{as well as the}} external relations between the individuals and their social world to recognize the determinants of acts. Thus, it adopts a mixed-methods approach involving ethnographic fieldworks supplemented by small-scale survey with convenient samples. Following the theoretical case selection strategy of global ethnography, it investigates <b>remitting</b> practices among Bangladeshi migrants in Tokyo and Los Angeles. Holding the origin of the migrants constant allows for isolating the role of their different destinations in determining their <b>remitting</b> practices. This dissertation recognizes social norms in origin culture, advances in family life-cycle, legal status and social incorporation and/or marginalization in the destination as the determinants of migrants' <b>remitting</b> practices. While confirming the centrality of migrant family in <b>remitting</b> practices in the NELM perspective, it goes beyond by including how internal family relations and external social relations collectively determine migrants' <b>remitting.</b> It advances our knowledge of migrants' <b>remitting</b> by incorporating both migrants' agency and social structures embedding <b>remitting</b> practices. Besides generating satisfactory explanations of migrants' <b>remitting,</b> this study demonstrates how to combine agency and structure in migration studies in particular and sociology in general. It also offers valuable insights for development policy-making utilizing migrants' remittances in their origin communities. It concludes with a call for extending the scope of the study by extensive and systematic use of quantitative data on the general patterns of <b>remitting</b> and to include familiar destination countries of temporary migration in future studies...|$|R

40|$|Two of {{the most}} salient trends in {{migration}} and development {{over the last two}} decades are the large rise in remittances and in the flow of skilled migrants.

The data show a mixed pattern between education and the likelihood of <b>remitting,</b> and a strong positive relationship between education and amount <b>remitted</b> (intensive margin), conditional on <b>remitting</b> at all (extensive margin). Combining these intensive and extensive margins yields an overall positive effect of education on the amount <b>remitted</b> for the pooled sample, with heterogeneous results across destinations.
