5000|$|The {{search for}} new ways to improve {{treatment}} of patients infected with HIV is constant. Considering the experience that has been gathered since the 1980s of ARV drug development arrival of INSTIs as a new potent class of ARV signals a new era in the treatment of HIV. Development of a successful INSTI treatment was accomplished when <b>raltegravir</b> was discovered by Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited. A conditional marketing authorization was licensed in December 2007 by the European Commission which was valid throughout the European Union. In 2009 this authorization was converted to a full marketing authorization and in the same year the FDA changed the approval from accelerated to traditional approval and listed the drug as a first line ARV treatment agent. [...] The second INSTI drug, elvitegravir, was identified by Japan Tobacco and clinical trials began in 2005. In 2011 the drug was still in phase three clinical trials, where it is being compared to <b>raltegravir,</b> in treatment experienced subjects and is also in phase two development in naïve subjects {{as a part of a}} multidrug treatment. S/GSK1349572 is an integrase inhibitor discovered by ViiV/Shinongi which was entering phase three in clinical trials in 2011. This new drug is promising and seems to be well tolerated and so far shows better results than both <b>raltegravir</b> and elvitegravir.|$|E

50|$|<b>Raltegravir</b> and {{elvitegravir}} {{share the}} same mechanism of action against integrase: to bind to the active site of Mg2+ ions. Competitive inhibitors compete directly with viral DNA for binding to integrase in order to inhibit 3‘-end processing. In doing this the inhibitors completely block the active site from binding to target DNA. This inhibition is called strand transfer inhibition.|$|E
5000|$|In November 2005, {{data from}} a phase 2 study of an investigational HIV {{integrase}} inhibitor, MK-0518, demonstrated that the compound has potent antiviral activity. On October 12, 2007, the Food and Drug Administration (U.S.) approved the integrase inhibitor <b>Raltegravir</b> (MK-0518, brand name Isentress).

50|$|It {{has been}} {{discovered}} that over 60 variations of INSTI mutations cause in vivo and in vitro resistance. Due to these mutations and development of resistance the inhibitors are less effective against the virus.Resistance of INI corresponds {{to those of other}} ARV drugs. First IN resistance is caused by primary mutations that decrease INI sensitivity in combination with secondary mutations that further reduce virus sensitivity and/or repair decreased fitness of the virus. Secondly there is a genetic barrier to INI resistance, defined by the number of mutations required for the loss of clinical INI activity. Thirdly there is extensive but incomplete cross-resistance among the INIs.A loop containing amino acid residues 140-149 is located in the catalytic-core domain and is important for IN function as mentioned before. This loop is flexible and even though its role is not quite known it is thought to be important and its functions critical for DNA binding. This resistance appears within mutations in this IN-coding region.The resistance to <b>raltegravir</b> and elvitegravir is primarily due to the same two mutation pathways but other primary mutations are also involved for each of the drugs. Some mutations increase resistance to the drugs to a large extent than others. For example, {{one of the most common}} mutation pathway increases the resistance to <b>raltegravir</b> up to 100 times more than the second most common one.Resistance to Integrase Inhibitor S/GSK1349572 is still being developed and the resistance has not been fully characterized. When it was assessed alongside the primary mutations of <b>raltegravir</b> and elvitegravir it did not show cross-resistance which means that it could be useful against drug resistant viruses.Raltegravir has limited intestinal absorption and thus resistance cannot be overcome by prescribing higher doses. Newer drugs are warranted to overcome this pharmacological disadvantage and gain plasma concentrations high enough to target raltegravir-resistant viruses.|$|E
50|$|Dolutegravir {{has also}} been studied in {{patients}} {{who have been on}} previous antiretroviral medications. The VIKING trial looked at patients who had known resistance to the first generation integrase inhibitor <b>raltegravir.</b> After 24 weeks 41% of patients on 50 mg dolutegravir once daily and 75% of patients on 50 mg twice daily (both along with an optimized background regimen) achieved an HIV RNA viral load of < 50 copies per mL. This demonstrated that there was little clinical cross-resistance between the two integrase inhibitors.|$|E
50|$|BI 224436 is an investigational {{new drug}} under {{development}} {{for the treatment of}} HIV infection. BI 224436 is the first non-catalytic site integrase inhibitor (NCINI). It inhibits HIV replication via binding to a conserved allosteric pocket of the HIV integrase enzyme. This makes the drug distinct in mechanism of action compared to <b>raltegravir</b> and elvitegravir, which bind at the catalytic site. In October 2011, Gilead Sciences purchased exclusive rights to develop BI 224436 and several related compounds under investigation in Boehringer Ingelheim’s noncatalytic site integrase inhibitor program.|$|E
50|$|The {{first human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) case {{was reported in the}} United States in the early 1980s. Many drugs have been discovered to treat the disease but mutations in the virus and resistance to the drugs make development difficult. Integrase is a viral enzyme that integrates retroviral DNA into the host cell genome. Integrase inhibitors are a new class of drugs used in the treatment of HIV. The first integrase inhibitor, <b>raltegravir,</b> was approved in 2007 and other drugs were in clinical trials in 2011.|$|E
50|$|However, despite {{previous}} {{success in}} clinical development (<b>raltegravir),</b> a detailed binding model is lacking {{so it has}} proven difficult to structure base the design of integrase inhibitors. When the pharmacophore of salicylic acid and catechol were merged, new chemical scaffolds were created. The adjacent hydroxyl and carboxylic groups on salicylic acid could bind with the metal ions and serve as their pharmacophore. Polyhydroxylated aromatic inhibitors are mostly active against strand transfer reactions and 3‘-processing which suggests a mechanism that targets both steps. This {{is a very important}} part of the compound as it can be used to bind to the divalent metal on the active site of IN and as such be effective against viral strains that are resistant to strand transfer specific inhibitors.|$|E
