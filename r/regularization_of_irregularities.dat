40|$|This is a corpus-based {{study which}} aims to survey the {{parallel}} use of non-standard preterit and past participle "-ed" forms {{in a group of}} irregular verbs (namely "blow", "grow", "know", and "throw") in Present-day American English and to determine in what media, style registers, and text types such non-standard verb forms occur. The data for this analysis is provided by the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) which comprises texts from the period of 1990 - 2010. The study confirms the fact that the majority of non-standard "-ed" verb forms occur in direct speech in fiction and, to a less degree, in newspspers in order to represent sociolectal and dialectal traits in varnacular English. Apart from this, non-standar "-ed" forms are inconspicuous in COCA; rare occurrences of such forms do not display a tendency towards <b>regularization</b> <b>of</b> morphological <b>irregularity</b> in the use of verbs under study. This study also confirms the variety-specific variation in the use of past participle forms of verbs such as "burn", "dream", "learn", "spell", "spill", and "spoil" since forms with the "-t" suffix shich are characteristic of BrE are rarely reported in COCA...|$|R

We propose a novel method for fast <b>regularization</b> <b>of</b> matrix group-valued images. Using the augmented Lagrangian framework we separate totalvariation <b>regularization</b> <b>of</b> matrix-valued images into a regularization and a projection steps. Both steps are computationally efficient and easily parallelizable, allowing real-time <b>regularization</b> <b>of</b> matrix valued images on a graphic processing unit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for smoothing several group-valued image types, with applications in directions diffusion, motion analysis from depth sensors, and DT-MRI denoising...|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation has}} been conducted to {{determine the influence of}} Representative Volume Element (RVE) size and degree <b>of</b> <b>irregularity</b> <b>of</b> polymer foam microstructure on its compressive mechanical properties, including stiffness, plateau stress and onset strain of densification. Periodic two-dimensional RVEs have been generated using a Voronoi-based numerical algorithm and compressed. Importantly, self-contact of the foam’s internal microstructure has been incorporated through the use of shell elements, allowing simulation of the foam well into the densification stage of compression; strains of up to 80 percent are applied. Results suggest that the stiffness of the foam RVE is relatively insensitive to RVE size but tends to soften as the degree <b>of</b> <b>irregularity</b> increases. Both the shape of the plateau stress and the onset strain of densification are sensitive to both the RVE size and degree <b>of</b> <b>irregularity.</b> Increasing the RVE size and decreasing the degree <b>of</b> <b>irregularity</b> both tend to result in a decrease of the gradient of the plateau region, while increasing the RVE size and degree <b>of</b> <b>irregularity</b> both tend to decrease the onset strain of densification. Finally, a method of predicting the onset strain of densification to an accuracy of about 10 per cent, while reducing the computational cost by two orders of magnitude is suggested...|$|R
