60|$|I dreamed {{the yellow}} summer moon, Behind a cedar wood, Lay white on fields of <b>rippling</b> <b>grass</b> Where I and Jenny stood.|$|R
6000|$|Then, {{their feet}} made {{music on the}} <b>rippling</b> <b>grass,</b> like {{thousand}} leaves of lilies on a lake. And, gliding nearer, Hautia welcomed Media; and said, [...] "Your comrade here is sad:--be ye gay. Ho, wine!--I pledge ye, guests!" ...|$|R
60|$|When {{she looked}} west {{the land was}} empty to the horizon, and a flock of big sand-hill cranes planed down the wind. An animal she thought was an {{antelope}} moved swiftly through the waves of <b>rippling</b> <b>grass.</b> When she turned east she saw a plume of black smoke roll across {{the sky and the}} tops of three elevators above the edge of the plain. It was a portent, a warning of momentous change, in which she and her husband must play their part. What that part would be she could not tell, but the curtain was going up, and on the whole she approved the stage and scenery.|$|R
60|$|The {{sun shone}} {{hot on the}} <b>rippling</b> <b>grass,</b> but it was cool on the shady veranda where Helen sat in a basket chair. A {{newspaper}} lay close by and the loose leaves fluttered now and then, {{but she did not}} notice that it was in some danger of blowing away. She had been occupied since early morning, but was not quite asleep, for she was vaguely conscious of a rhythmic drumming. By and by she raised her head with a jerk and glanced at the watch on her wrist. It was three o'clock and she had been dozing for an hour. Then the drumming fixed her attention and she saw a rig lurch along the uneven trail. The horses were trotting fast and there were two people in the light wagon.|$|R
60|$|Winter {{had fled}} back beyond the barrens to the lonely North at last, and though {{here and there}} a little slushy snow still lay soaking the black loam in a hollow, a warm wind swept the vast levels when one morning Colonel Barrington rode with his niece and sister across the prairie. Spring comes {{suddenly}} in that region, and the frost-bleached sod was steaming under an effulgent sun, while in places a hardy flower peeped through. It was six hundred miles to the forests of the Rockies' eastern slope, and as far to the Athabascan pines, but it seemed to Maud Barrington that their resinous sweetness was in the glorious western wind, which awoke a musical sighing from the sea of <b>rippling</b> <b>grass.</b> It rolled away before her in billows of lustrous silver-grey, and had for sole boundary the first upward spring of the arch of cloudless blue, across which the vanguard of the feathered host pressed on, company by company towards the Pole.|$|R
60|$|The {{dazzling}} {{blue of the}} sky {{was broken}} by rounded masses of silver-edged clouds that drove along before a fresh northwest breeze. Streaked by their speeding shadows, the great plain stretched away, checkered by ranks of marigolds and tall crimson flowers of the lily kind that swayed as the <b>rippling</b> <b>grasses</b> changed color in the wind. A mile or two distant stood the trim wooden homestead, with a tall windmill frame near by, girt by broad sweeps of dark-green wheat and oats. These were interspersed with stretches of uncovered soil, glowing a deep chocolate-brown, which Muriel knew was the summer fallow resting after a cereal crop. Beyond the last strip of rich color, there spread, shining delicately blue, a great field of flax; and then the dusky green of alfalfa and alsike for the Hereford cattle, standing knee-deep in a flashing lake. The prairie, she thought, was beautiful in summer; its wideness was bracing, one was stirred into cheerfulness and bodily vigor by the rush of its fresh winds. She felt that she could remain contentedly at the homestead for a long time; and then her thoughts centered on its owner.|$|R
60|$|They had {{no further}} {{conversation}} for another hour. The poplars rustled {{behind them and}} the <b>grass</b> <b>rippled</b> and clashed, but now and then the breeze died away for a few moments, {{and there was a}} curious and almost disconcerting stillness. At last, in one of these intervals, the Canadian, partly rising, lifted his hand.|$|R
60|$|From the {{far north}} they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming storm. There now came a sharp {{whistling}} in the air from the south, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw <b>ripples</b> in the <b>grass</b> coming from that direction also.|$|R
60|$|Her little daughter, Viola, {{had been}} {{spending}} {{the day with}} me, {{and it was a}} lovely spring evening, when we sat on the lawn, wondering whether I should ever care for anything so much as for those long shadows from the fir woods upon the sloping field, with the long <b>grass</b> <b>rippling</b> in the wind, and the border of primroses round the edge of the wood.|$|R
60|$|It {{was late}} in the {{afternoon}} when Colonel Barrington drove up to Winston's homestead. He had his niece and sister with him, and when he pulled up his team, all three were glad of the little breeze that came down from the blueness of the north and <b>rippled</b> the whitened <b>grass.</b> It had blown over leagues of sun-bleached prairie, and the great desolation beyond the pines of the Saskatchewan, but had not wholly lost the faint, wholesome chill it brought from the Pole.|$|R
5000|$|In the Percy Jackson & the Olympians and The Heroes of Olympus {{series by}} Rick Riordan, Elysium is {{depicted}} as a gated community from which one could hear laughter and smell barbecue cooking. Besides having the Isle of the Blessed {{in the center of}} a large lake there, Elysium has neighborhoods of beautiful houses from every time period in history such as Roman villas, medieval castles, and Victorian mansions. It also has flowers of silver and gold blooming on the lawns and <b>grass</b> <b>rippling</b> in rainbow colors.|$|R
6000|$|Better {{than the}} gig! No {{man in a}} gig could have such {{interest}} in the milestones. No man in a gig could see, or feel, or think, like merry users of their legs. How, as the wind sweeps on, upon these breezy downs, it tracks its flight in darkening <b>ripples</b> on the <b>grass,</b> and smoothest shadows on the hills! Look round and round upon this bare bleak plain, and see even here, upon a winter's day, how beautiful the shadows are! Alas! it {{is the nature of}} their kind to be so. The loveliest things in life, Tom, are but shadows; and they come and go, and change and fade away, as rapidly as these! ...|$|R
60|$|In summer, too, Canute-like, sitting here, one {{is often}} {{reminded}} of the sea. For not only do long ground-swells roll the slanting grain, and little wavelets of the <b>grass</b> <b>ripple</b> over upon the low piazza, as their beach, and the blown down of dandelions is wafted like the spray, and the purple of the mountains is just the purple of the billows, and a still August noon broods upon the deep meadows, as a calm upon the Line; but the vastness and the lonesomeness are so oceanic, and the silence and the sameness, too, that the first peep of a strange house, rising beyond the trees, is {{for all the world}} like spying, on the Barbary coast, an unknown sail.|$|R
60|$|It was, however, warm at last, and a {{wonderful}} fresh breeze which had the quality of an elixir in it <b>rippled</b> the whitened <b>grass.</b> Alison felt her heart grow lighter. The vast plain was certainly desolate, but it had lost its forbidding grimness. It had no limit or boundary; one felt free out there and cares and apprehensions melted in the sunshine that flooded it. She began to understand why she had seen no pinched and pallid faces in this new land. Its inhabitants laughed whole-heartedly, looked one in the eyes, and walked with a quick, jaunty swing. They seemed alert, self-confident, optimistic and quaintly whimsical. It {{was hard to believe}} there was not some nook in it that she could fill.|$|R
60|$|It {{was a good}} {{summer at}} Allenwood, for the June rains were prolonged. The mornings broke cool and breezy, but, as a rule, at noon the clouds which had sailed eastward singly began to gather in compact banks. Then would come a roll of thunder and a deluge that might last an hour, after which the prairie lay bright in the {{sunshine}} until evening fell. The <b>grass</b> <b>rippled</b> across the waste in waves of vivid green, with flowers tossing beneath the gusts like wreaths of colored foam. Wild barley raised its spiky heads along the trails, and in the hollows the natural hay grew rank and tall. No sand blew from the bare ridges to cut the tender grain, which shot up apace and belted the prairie with its darker verdure.|$|R
6000|$|As {{they stood}} hesitating in the hall, they {{heard one of}} the first-floor bedroom windows crack and clash. Kemp {{went to the door}} and began to slip the bolts as silently as possible. His face was a little paler than usual. [...] "You must step {{straight}} out," [...] said Kemp. In another moment Adye was on the doorstep and the bolts were dropping back into the staples. He hesitated for a moment, feeling more comfortable with his back against the door. Then he marched, upright and square, down the steps. He crossed the lawn and approached the gate. A little breeze seemed to <b>ripple</b> over the <b>grass.</b> Something moved near him. [...] "Stop a bit," [...] said a Voice, and Adye stopped dead and his hand tightened on the revolver.|$|R
60|$|For {{three days}} we marched {{in the green}} shade of the primeval wood, nor saw the sky save in blue patches here and there. Again we toiled for hours through the coffee-colored waters of the swamps. But the third day brought us to the first of those strange clearings which the French call prairies, where the long <b>grass</b> <b>ripples</b> like a lake in the summer wind. Here we first knew raging thirst, and longed for the loam-specked water we had scorned, as our tired feet tore through the grass. For Saunders, our guide, took a line across the open in plain sight of any eye that might be {{watching}} from the forest cover. But at length our column wavered and halted by reason of some disturbance {{at the head of}} it. Conjectures in our company, the rear guard, became rife at once.|$|R
60|$|What are ears? what is Time? {{that this}} {{particular}} series of sounds called a strain of music, an invisible and fairy troop which never brushed the dew from any mead, can be wafted down through the centuries from Homer to me, and he have been conversant with that same aerial and mysterious charm which now so tingles my ears? What a fine communication from age to age, of the fairest and noblest thoughts, the aspirations of ancient men, even such as were never communicated by speech, is music! It is the flower of language, thought colored and curved, fluent and flexible, its crystal fountain tinged with the sun's rays, and its purling <b>ripples</b> reflecting the <b>grass</b> and the clouds. A strain of music {{reminds me of a}} passage of the Vedas, and I associate with it the idea of infinite remoteness, as well as of beauty and serenity, for to the senses that is farthest from us which addresses the greatest depth within us. It teaches us again and again to trust the remotest and finest as the divinest instinct, and makes a dream our only real experience. We feel a sad cheer when we hear it, perchance because we that hear are not one with that which is heard.|$|R
40|$|The {{photographs}} of On Nine Mile {{were made to}} explore my developing relationship with the place I now inhabit. They compare {{the reality of a}} place against preconception and actual experience versus idealized expectations. I made this work to help understand a landscape to which I was transplanted and to which I had no connection. This exhibition is comprised of photographs taken at a section of untilled prairie called Nine Mile that most closely resembled my visual preconception of the Great Plains. I grew up in the Pacific Northwest surrounded by the mountains, forests, and shoreline that typify the landscape of the region. During the thirty years I lived there I developed a deeply personal relationship with these features of the landscape and they became synonymous with beauty, home, and comfort. The landscape I envisioned, and hoped to see when I moved from the Northwest to the Great Plains, was that of Laura Ingalls Wilder books, “…endless flat land covered with tall grass blowing in the wind…[and] nothing but the <b>rippling</b> <b>grass</b> and enormous sky. ” (Wilder, 13) I ventured into the landscape of Eastern Nebraska as soon as I arrived. My naïve expectations were quickly proven incorrect when I encountered the reality of the plains landscape with corn and soybean farms dominating the land. While I expected the presence of farming operations from my research into the state, the sheer quantity and scale of these entities surprised me. I became ambivalent about this landscape within a few months of relocating. I found myself in the mindset of those from outside the region – that this place was not much more than fly-over country. I couldn’t see past the farms. I relied on photography to establish a connection to my new location and to help me feel grounded. Taking to heart Susan Sontag’s assertion that “Photographs give people an imaginary possession of a past that is unreal… [and] help people to take possession of a space in which they are insecure…” (Sontag, 6) I believed that photographing this space would have a reciprocal effect and that, beyond a sense of being grounded and taking ownership, I would also feel like I belonged to this place. Through the act of photography I searched for the beauty that Robert Adams describes as ”… a synonym for the coherence and structure underlying life. ” (Adams, 24) I wanted to understand that structure and see the coherence that existed in the Great Plains landscape. Nine Mile Prairie became a specimen for me to examine, explore and photograph. Photography allows for a unique and direct existential relationship between the photograph and its subject. While work created in other mediums can be produced in the presence of their subject, a photograph can only be made when the subject exists in front of the camera: in order to create my photographs I had to interact with the landscape directly. Each time I returned to Nine Mile Prairie, I would notice subtle differences that gave insight into the systems underlying the landscape. I chose to photograph primarily in the fall and winter when the landscape was dormant and cold. However, glimpses of green could be found in the yellows and browns of the land as it rested. I found subtle indications of life that became symbolic of the annual growth and death processes of the landscape. The photographs describe the latent potential of the plants inhabiting the space – a quiet sense of possibility that will soon be fulfilled. Photographing during these times of the year also allowed me to organize and make sense of a landscape that from a distance has no distinguishable features, but that upon closer inspection is full of life and shows the signs of the natural and human processes underlying the land. In fall and winter, these processes become visible through the lack of foliage where they would otherwise be obscured. According to Robert Adams, form and beauty “[help] us meet our worst fear, the suspicion that life may be chaos and that therefore our suffering is without meaning. ” (Adams, 25) He writes, “a photographer can describe a better world only by better seeing the world that is in front of him. ” (Adams, 26) With the ability of photography to capture and organize individual details by separating them from their surroundings my work is able to examine particular elements of interest and place them in context with the greater whole of the landscape. In creating this work I have become rooted in a landscape that I once considered shapeless and bleak. I found beauty and form in the small portions of prairie among the corn and soybean fields. By revealing this overlooked beauty I hope my work leads viewers to reflect on the relationship they have with their own landscapes and encourages a deeper exploration and understanding of the spaces they inhabit.

60|$|Now, on a {{somewhat}} nearer approach, the precipice did not belie its purple promise from the manorial piazza--that sweet imposing purple promise, which seemed fully to vindicate the Bunyanish old title originally bestowed;--but showed the profuse aerial foliage of a hanging forest. Nevertheless, coming still more nigh, long and frequent rents among {{the mass of}} leaves revealed horrible glimpses of dark-dripping rocks, and mysterious mouths of wolfish caves. Struck by this most unanticipated view, the tourist now quickened his impulsive steps to verify the change by coming into direct contact with so chameleon a height. As he would now speed on, the lower ground, which from the manor-house piazza seemed all a grassy level, suddenly merged into a very long and weary acclivity, slowly rising close up to the precipice's base; so that the efflorescent <b>grasses</b> <b>rippled</b> against it, as the efflorescent waves of some great swell or long rolling billow ripple against the water-line of a steep gigantic war-ship on the sea. And, as among the rolling sea-like sands of Egypt, disordered rows of broken Sphinxes lead to the Cheopian pyramid itself; so this long acclivity was thickly strewn with enormous rocky masses, grotesque in shape, and with wonderful features on them, which seemed to express that slumbering intelligence visible in some recumbent beasts--beasts whose intelligence seems struck dumb in them by some sorrowful and inexplicable spell. Nevertheless, round and round those still enchanted rocks, hard by their utmost rims, and in among their cunning crevices, the misanthropic hill-scaling goat nibbled his sweetest food; for the rocks, so barren in themselves, distilled a subtile moisture, which fed with greenness all things that grew about their igneous marge.|$|R
