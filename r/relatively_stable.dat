5000|$|... trans-Bis(dinitrogen)bis1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethanemolybdenum(0) is a {{coordination}} complex {{with the}} formula Mo(N2)2(dppe)2. It is a <b>relatively</b> air <b>stable</b> yellow-orange solid. It is notable {{as being the}} first dinitrogen containing complex of molybdenum.|$|R
50|$|Pyrogens {{can often}} be {{difficult}} to remove from solution due to the high variability of their molecular weight. Pyrogens are also <b>relatively</b> thermally <b>stable</b> and insensitive to pH changes. However, several removal techniques exist.|$|R
5|$|Laws {{should be}} <b>relatively</b> <b>stable</b> and not changed too often, as with {{frequently}} changing laws {{it may be}} hard for people to keep themselves updated. People need to know what the law is both for short- and long-term planning.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} and physical properties of ytterbium {{could not be}} determined with any precision until 1953, when the first nearly pure ytterbium metal was produced by using ion-exchange processes. The price of ytterbium was <b>relatively</b> <b>stable</b> between 1953 and 1998 at about US $1,000/kg.|$|E
5|$|While {{technology}} increases {{demand for}} entertainment products and offers increased speed of delivery, the forms {{that make up}} the content are in themselves, <b>relatively</b> <b>stable.</b> Storytelling, music, theatre, dance and games are recognisably the same as in earlier centuries.|$|E
50|$|<b>Relatively</b> more <b>stable</b> {{entities}} with unpaired electrons do exist, e.g. the {{nitric oxide}} molecule has one. According to Hund's rule, the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned parallel and this gives these molecules paramagnetic properties.|$|R
50|$|TiCl3 {{and most}} of its {{complexes}} are typically handled under air-free conditions to prevent reactions with oxygen and moisture. Depending on the method for its preparation, samples of TiCl3 can be <b>relatively</b> air <b>stable</b> or pyrophoric.|$|R

5|$|The Kuiper belt was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} the source of the Solar System's ecliptic comets. However, studies of the region since 1992 have shown that the orbits within the Kuiper belt are <b>relatively</b> <b>stable,</b> and that ecliptic comets originate from the scattered disc, where orbits are generally less stable.|$|E
5|$|The {{price for}} pure bismuth metal has been <b>relatively</b> <b>stable</b> {{through most of}} the 20th century, except for a spike in the 1970s. Bismuth has always been {{produced}} mainly as a byproduct of lead refining, and thus the price usually reflected the cost of recovery and the balance between production and demand.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1960s, the {{population}} had been <b>relatively</b> <b>stable</b> for decades at around 60,000 (excluding the Occupation years). Economic growth spurred immigration and {{a rise in}} population, which is now (2013) about 100,000. From the 1960s Portuguese workers arrived, mostly working initially in seasonal industries in agriculture and tourism.|$|E
50|$|Nearby are the Taebaek Mountains, {{formed through}} ancient thrust {{faulting}} and subsequent fault-block motion, whose eastern reaching ranges form a steep fault line stretching to the coast. Korea is <b>relatively</b> geologically <b>stable,</b> though the Taebaek may experience slow, but ongoing, tectonic uplift.|$|R
50|$|Weather in Iwami can {{be quite}} changeable, with summer {{temperatures}} peaking at over 30 degrees Celsius in August and dropping as low as -2 degrees in January and February.

5|$|Before development, Hamersley was {{a remote}} {{district}} covered in jarrah, marri, banksia and other vegetation {{typical of the}} Swan Coastal Plain, with small areas cleared for small-scale agriculture such as market gardening and poultry farming. By 1974, six {{years after the first}} subdivision, Hamersley was home to the district's first community hall, an annual parade and fair which were broadcast on Perth TV and radio, an active progress association, and its own newspaper, the Hamersley Gazette, a forerunner to today's Stirling Times. Rapid growth further north removed the focus from Hamersley, which was completed in 1981 and has remained <b>relatively</b> <b>stable</b> since then.|$|E
5|$|Bosaso in <b>relatively</b> <b>stable</b> {{autonomous}} Puntland {{emerged as}} a regional hub and major port. A small fishing village prior to {{the fall of the}} state, Bosaso developed a lucrative import/export trade of U.S. $15 million per year out of its port during the 1990s. The population grew in eight years from 5,000 to 150,000, sustained by public services provided on a competitive basis by private enterprise, and court systems, schools and a university founded by the local community.|$|E
5|$|Braille {{studied in}} Coupvray {{until the age}} of ten. Because of his {{combination}} of intelligence and diligence, Braille was permitted to attend one of the first schools for blind children in the world, the Royal Institute for Blind Youth, since renamed to the National Institute for Blind Youth in Paris. Braille, the last of the family's children to leave the household, departed for the school in February 1819. At that time the Royal Institute was an underfunded, ramshackle affair, but it provided a <b>relatively</b> <b>stable</b> environment for blind children to learn and associate together.|$|E
50|$|The Congress {{has often}} been criticized for causing the {{subsequent}} suppression of the emerging national and liberal movements, {{and it has been}} seen as a reactionary movement for the benefit of traditional monarchs. However, others praise it for having created <b>relatively</b> long-term <b>stable</b> and peaceful conditions in most of Europe.|$|R
25|$|It is {{commonly}} believed that Yu's successful campaign symbolized {{the fact that}} President Chen Shui-bian's Justice Alliance was still in power within the party. After Su Tseng-chang, {{also a member of}} the Justice Alliance, was appointed the premier, his term was <b>relatively</b> more <b>stable</b> as a result of the mutual cooperation between the three leaders.|$|R
50|$|Triphenylphosphine (IUPAC name: triphenylphosphane) is {{a common}} organophosphorus {{compound}} with the formula P(C6H5)3 - often abbreviated to PPh3 or Ph3P. It is widely used in the synthesis of organic and organometallic compounds. PPh3 exists as <b>relatively</b> air <b>stable,</b> colorless crystals at room temperature. It dissolves in non-polar organic solvents such as benzene and diethyl ether.|$|R
5|$|HD 2039 is {{a yellow}} dwarf or yellow subgiant {{star in the}} {{constellation}} Phoenix. The star is not {{visible to the naked}} eye, and lies approximately 330 light years away from the Sun. HD 2039 is a <b>relatively</b> <b>stable</b> star, and an exoplanet at least three times the mass of the planet Jupiter has been discovered in its orbit; this exoplanet, known as HD 2039 b, was the 100th exoplanet to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|Living asteroids, the Neoasteroidea, are morphologically {{distinct}} from their forerunners in the Paleozoic. The taxonomy {{of the group}} is <b>relatively</b> <b>stable</b> but there is ongoing debate {{about the status of}} the Paxillosida, and the deep-water sea daisies, though clearly Asteroidea and currently included in Velatida, do not fit easily in any accepted lineage. Phylogenetic data suggests that they may be a sister group, the Concentricycloidea, to the Neoasteroidea, or that the Velatida themselves may be a sister group.|$|E
5|$|Some {{evidence}} {{does suggest that}} the Southern Oscillation is weakly correlated with changes in tornado activity, which vary by season and region, as well as whether the ENSO phase is that of El Niño or La Niña. Research has found that fewer tornadoes and hailstorms occur in winter and spring in the U.S. central and southern plains during El Niño, and more occur during La Niña, than in years when temperatures in the Pacific are <b>relatively</b> <b>stable.</b> Ocean conditions {{could be used to}} forecast extreme spring storm events several months in advance.|$|E
40|$|Biological ice nuclei (active at {{approximately}} - 4 degrees C) were extracted from {{cells of the}} lichen Rhizoplaca chrysoleuca by sonication. Sensitivity to proteases, guanidine hydrochloride, and urea showed these nuclei to be proteinaceous. The nuclei were <b>relatively</b> heat <b>stable,</b> active from pH 1. 5 to 12, and active without lipids, thereby demonstrating significant differences from bacterial ice nuclei...|$|R

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of nobelium is incompletely characterized {{and is known}} only in aqueous solution, in which it can take on the +3 or +2 oxidation states, the latter being more stable. It was largely expected before the discovery of nobelium that in solution, it would behave like the other actinides, with the trivalent state being predominant; however, Seaborg predicted in 1949 that the +2 state would also be <b>relatively</b> <b>stable</b> for nobelium, as the No2+ ion would have the ground-state electron configuration 5f14, including the stable filled 5f14 shell. It took nineteen years before this prediction was confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Tolkien began devising the {{language}} around 1910 and restructured the grammar several times until Quenya reached its final state. The vocabulary remained <b>relatively</b> <b>stable</b> throughout the creation process. Also, {{the name of}} {{the language}} was repeatedly changed by Tolkien from Elfin and Qenya to the eventual Quenya. The Finnish language had been a major source of inspiration, but Tolkien was also familiar with Latin, Greek, and ancient Germanic languages when he began constructing Quenya.|$|E
5|$|With the {{situation}} in Europe and Asia <b>relatively</b> <b>stable,</b> Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union made preparations. With the Soviets wary of mounting tensions with Germany and the Japanese planning {{to take advantage of}} the European War by seizing resource-rich European possessions in Southeast Asia, the two powers signed the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1941. By contrast, the Germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the Soviet Union, massing forces on the Soviet border.|$|E
