40|$|Since 1995, a {{stratified}} random {{spring bottom}} trawl survey in the NAFO Regulatory Area of Div. 3 NO {{was conducted by}} Spain. In 2001, the trawl vessel was replaced; so, the time series indices were transformed. The transformed entire series of mean catches, biomass and length distribution for <b>Roughead</b> <b>grenadier</b> are presented for the period 1997 - 2000, and the no-transformed data for the years 2002 - 2004. In 2001, there are data from the two vessels. The summed biomass based on conversion of the length frequencies are presented and compared to the estimates from the method used to convert the CPUE. The indices of this species remains stable along the years, although an increasing is observed in last year (2004) ...|$|E
40|$|Since 1995, a {{stratified}} random {{spring bottom}} trawl survey in the NAFO Regulatory Area of Div. 3 NO {{was conducted by}} Spain. The depth strata surveyed was extended to 1464 m. The main propose of the surveys was obtain abundance and biomass indices for the commercial species in the area (American plaice, yellowtail flounder, Greenland halibut, cod, witch, <b>roughead</b> <b>grenadier</b> and thorny skate). Following {{the recommendations of the}} 2000 Scientific Council Meeting, the entire series of abundance and biomass for American Plaice, the description of the survey design, the specifications and the geometry of the sampling trawl used in the Spanish spring survey in Div. 3 NO, are presented for the period 1995 - 2000. The indices calculated from the survey series, shows an increasing in the American plaice abundance and biomass in the area...|$|E
