2500|$|The first {{theory that}} {{explains}} the rationale for odd pricing is prospect theory. This theory says that [...] "consumers facing uncertainty in decision making, base {{the value of an}} alternative on gains or losses offered by the alternative, relative to some reference point, rather than on final absolute states of wealth or welfare". This theory is {{based on the fact that}} losses mean more than gains. So based on that criterion, one would think that something only a few cents under a whole dollar would actually be beneficial to the price. This theory works so well because of how the [...] "reference price" [...] is established by the consumer. The <b>reference</b> <b>price</b> for something that is $19.98 would be $20.

40|$|<b>Reference</b> <b>pricing</b> {{intends to}} reduce {{pharmaceutical}} expenditures by increasing demand elasticity and stimulating generic competition. We develop a novel model where a brand-name producer competes in prices with several generics producers {{in a market}} with brand-biased and brand-neutral consumers. Comparing with coinsurance, we show that <b>reference</b> <b>pricing,</b> contrary to policy makers’ intentions, discourages generic entry, as it induces the brand-name producer to price more aggressively. Thus, {{the net effect of}} <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> on drug prices is ambiguous, implying that <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> can be counterproductive in reducing expenditures. However, under price regulation, we show that <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> may stimulate generic entry, since a binding price cap weakens the aggressive price response by the brand-name producer. This may explain mixed empirical results on the competitive effects of <b>reference</b> <b>pricing.</b> Finally, we show that <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> may be welfare improving when accounting for brand preferences despite its adverse effects on entry and prices.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the effect of}} <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> on {{pharmaceutical}} prices and expenditures when generic entry is endogenously determined. We develop a Salop-type model where a brand-name producer competes with generic producers in terms of prices. In the market {{there are two types}} of consumers: (i) brand biased consumers who choose between brand-name and generic drugs, and (ii) brand neutral consumers who choose between the di¤erent generic drugs. We find that, for a given number of firms, <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> leads to lower prices of all products and higher brand-name market shares compared with a reimbursement scheme based on simple coinsurance. Thus, in a free entry equilibrium, the number of generics is lower under <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> than under coinsurance, implying that the net e¤ects of <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> on prices and expenditures are ambiguous. Allowing for price cap regulation, we show that the negative e¤ect on generic entry can be reversed, and that <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> is more likely to result in cost savings than under free pricing. Our results shed light on the mixed empirical evidence on the effects of <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> on generic entry...|$|R

However, Thaler (Marketing Science 4 (1985) 199; Journal of Behavioral Decision Making 12 (1999) 183) defined them as fair prices expected from specific types of seller. Using a Beer Pricing Task, he found that seller context had a substantial effect on willingness to pay, and concluded that this was due to specific internal <b>reference</b> <b>prices</b> evoked by specific contexts. In a think aloud study using the same task (N= 48), we found only a marginal effect of seller context. In a second study using the Beer Pricing Task and seven analogous ones (N= 144), general internal <b>reference</b> <b>prices</b> were estimated by asking people what they normally paid for various commodities. Both general internal <b>reference</b> <b>prices</b> and seller context influenced willingness to pay, although the effect of the latter was again rather small.

40|$|An {{alternative}} scheme {{has been}} suggested to the <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> framework currently used in New Zealand. The subsidisation scheme outlined in Johnston, M and Zeckhauser, R. (1991) The Australian Pharmaceutical Subsidy Gambit: Transmuting Deadweight Loss and Oligopoly Rents to Consumer Surplus offers only the subsidy required to prompt acceptance of subsidisation by firms. This scheme is valid only where marginal costs are known. This thesis incorporates {{the creation of a}} framework for the comparison of pharmaceutical subsidy schemes, the expansion of the Johnston and Zeckhauser scheme into an environment of imperfect information, and the comparison of this modified scheme with the variant of <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> used in New Zealand. This comparison finds that the Johnston and Zeckhauser scheme generally provides subsidisation at a lower cost than <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> provided that a suitable threshold is placed on the time taken for a firm to accept subsidisation. Unfortunately the JZ scheme does not appear to provide a valid alternative to <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> as, on average, it is likely to promote a lower level of efficiency than the status quo. The thesis finds that <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> is however not without its problems, as the possibility exists that <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> will, in some cases, provide firms with less than the level of profit necessary to convince them to accept subsidisation...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} impact of <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> and {{extension}} of generic substitution on the daily cost of antipsychotic drugs in Finland during the first year after its launch. Furthermore, the additional impact of <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> on prior implemented generic substitution is assessed. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed between 2006 and 2010. A segmented linear regression analysis of interrupted time series was used to estimate changes in the levels and trends in the cost of one day of treatment. Of the study drugs, clozapine belonged to generic substitution already {{at the start of the}} study period while olanzapine and quetiapine were included in generic substitution alongside with <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> in 2009. Risperidone was included in generic substitution in 2008, before <b>reference</b> <b>pricing.</b> Results: A substantial decrease in the daily cost of all four antipsychotic substances was seen after one year of the implementation of <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> and the extension of generic substitution. The impact ranged from - 29. 9 % to - 66. 3 %, and it was most substantial on the daily cost of olanzapine. Also in the daily cost of risperidone a substantial decrease of - 43. 3 % was observed. However, most of these savings, - 32. 6 %, were generated by generic substitution which had been adopted prior. Conclusions: <b>Reference</b> <b>pricing</b> and the extension of generic substitution produced substantial savings on antipsychotic medication costs during the first year after its launch, but the intensity of the impact differed between active substances. Furthermore, our results suggest that the additional cost savings from <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> after prior implemented generic substitution, are comparatively low...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a therapeutic market with potentially three pharmaceutical firms. Two {{of the firms}} offer horizontally differentiated brand-name drugs.

This model allows us to compare generic <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> (GRP), therapeutic <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> (TRP), and no <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> (NRP). We show that competition is strongest under TRP, resulting in the lowest drug prices (and medical expenditures).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: General Directorate of Pharmaceuticals and Pharmacy (IEGM) is {{responsible}} for setting all prices for human medicinal products. The <b>reference</b> <b>pricing</b> system is used for setting these <b>prices.</b> <b>Reference</b> countries are reviewed annually and {{may be subject to}} certain alterations. There were 5 reference countries in 2009 : Spain, Italy, Germany, France and Greece. The aim {{of this study is to}} show the distribution of reference countries which were used for <b>reference</b> <b>pricing.</b> METHODS: The price list of pharmaceuticals which was published by IEGM on 15. 04. 2011 was used for analysis. Distribution of <b>reference</b> countries and <b>prices</b> were evaluated. RESULTS: Prices of 6, 251 generic and 3, 703 original products were set according to the price list. 5, 283 of generics and 3, 306 of originals were in the positive list for reimbursement. <b>Reference</b> <b>pricing</b> was used for 2, 352 generics and 2, 281 originals. Prices of the remaining were set outside of <b>reference</b> <b>pricing.</b> 32 different countries were used for <b>reference</b> <b>pricing.</b> Italy was the most popular country for <b>reference</b> <b>pricing.</b> Even if it was not a reference country, Germany was used in some of the pharmaceuticals. The average reimbursement discount rate and price were 24. 43 % and 249 TL, respectively. There were no colerations between price and reimbursement discount rate, or reference country and reimbursement rate. CONCLUSION: It has been shown that Italy has the highest impact on the pricing of all pharmaceuticals in Turkey. Even if it was not a reference country, Germany showed to affect pharmaceuticals more than other countries which were also not used for <b>reference</b> <b>pricing.</b> Even if reimbursement discount rates are stated by the Social Security Institution (SGK), there are different discount rates for pharmaceuticals.
