40|$|The {{focus of}} the {{research}} reported in this paper has been to estimate <b>recreation</b> <b>values</b> for beaches over approximately 1, 400 km (km) of coastline along the Queensland coast.

Negative binomial models have been used to estimate both the visit rate and <b>recreation</b> <b>values</b> associated with beach visits in different regional areas.

40|$|Abstract: Managers of Canadian Crown {{lands are}} {{beginning}} to recognize that all values the public associates with forests should be given due consideration in management actions. Arguably, recreation and tourism are the least understood values of the resource and typically receive only secondary consideration in management decisions on an ad-hoc basis. This situation partly results {{from the lack of}} a systematic framework for recreation management in Crown lands outside of protected areas at either the provincial or the national level. This presentation discusses the development of a spatial recreation planning framework that uses <b>recreation</b> <b>values</b> to assess the effects of various forestry activities. The framework expands upon traditional planning approaches that are primarily supply driven to directly address core user values rather than traditional user preferences. A spatial GIS model was developed that incorporates interactive data layers of the study area including high resolution orthophoto mosaic, forest resource inventory, recreation facilities locations, ROS type classification, activity participation, spatial trip patterns, and <b>recreation</b> <b>values.</b> These data layers are overlaid on the forest management plan that details the harvesting and silvicultural treatments that are planned for the next 20 years. Operation of the interactive model is based on maintaining recreation portfolios, recreation class consistency, and sets of contextualized <b>recreation</b> <b>values.</b> A process is discussed as to how this new framework will provide managers with a tool to evaluate recreation related impacts a priori to resource management actions, and allow the public to ask “what if ” scenarios in an interactive mode...|$|R

40|$|We develop {{estimates}} of the economic effects of climate change-induced sea level rise on recreation at seventeen southern North Carolina beaches. We estimate the relationship between recreation behavior and beach width and simulate the effects of sea level rise on recreation site choice and trip frequency. We find that reductions in beach width due to increased erosion from sea-level rise negatively affect the number and value of beach recreation trips. For beach goers who only take day trips, we estimate that four percent of <b>recreation</b> <b>value</b> is lost in 2030 and 11 percent is lost in 2080. For those who take both day and overnight trips, 16 percent and 34 percent of <b>recreation</b> <b>value</b> is lost in 2030 and 2080, respectively.

The main aims of this article are separation of influential factors on visitors ' willingness to pay (WTP) for Saint Stepanus Church visiting costs using Heckman two-stage Method and Contingent Valuation Method (CVM). Required data was gathered through questionnaires and face-to-face interviews with 317 visitors of the church.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the steps of}} estimating the <b>recreation</b> <b>value</b> of a national park by combining two non-market valuation methods: the Travel Cost Method and the Contingent Valuation Method.

The <b>recreation</b> <b>value</b> in terms of consumer surplus per trip is derived from the Poisson model and in terms of willingness to pay per trip from the random effects probit model. It was found that tourists gain significant benefits from recreating in the park. The estimated recreation values are expressed in monetary units and provide justification for attracting funds for developing tourism opportunities in a sustainable way. Moreover, the findings show that tourists are aware {{of the value of the}} park and do appreciate the opportunities offered by the park administrations.

In this paper we define and estimate the total economic <b>recreation</b> <b>value</b> to visitors of a particular natural area, a national park. An on-site individual observation Travel Cost Model, Count Data distributions, and a version of hyperbolic discounting framework distribution were used to estimate a measure for the present recreation use of the site and the total discounted <b>recreation</b> <b>value</b> for a 50 years period. The empirical estimates of the average representative visitor’s present equivalent surplus willingness to pay, based on the impact assumption of closure or loss of access to the park were 123 € per day per visit, and 593 € per each average five days length visit, per visitor. These values suggest that recreation use of nature has a higher value than certain economic activities in the area.

40|$|Recreation {{benefits}} {{constitute a}} substantial part of the total economic value of forests, and are important for the choice of multi-functional forest policies. The application of methods valuing such benefits is in its infancy in transition economies in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), so value estimates for policy use are sometimes transferred from Western Europe proportionally scaled down by GDP. However, little is known about how <b>recreation</b> <b>values</b> vary with income, and one risks underestimating benefits in CEE. This paper reports the findings of the first comprehensive, national-level study in any CEE country estimating annual and per trip forest <b>recreation</b> <b>values</b> in Poland using the Travel Cost (TC) and Contingent Valuation (CV) methods. Two in-person interview surveys of forest recreation behaviour were carried out. The first was administered on-site in ten representative forest areas, and the other in the homes of a national sample of adult Poles. Results show that forest <b>recreation</b> is highly <b>valued</b> in Poland, at Euros 0. 64 - 6. 93 per trip per person, depending on the valuation method. Both trip frequency and per trip values are higher than the average in Western Europe, despite a lower income level. Thus, a simple GDP-adjusted transfer from Western Europe would substantially undervalue forest recreation in Poland. Further, a comparison of TC consumer surplus estimates and GDP/capita in Europe shows no clear relationship, indicating that a range of cultural, institutional and other factors may be important. ...|$|R

40|$|Although {{spending}} time in a summer home is a popular leisure activity in many developed countries, {{little is known about}} the welfare impacts of such recreation in monetary terms. We use data from Finland to provide first estimates of the extent of the recreation benefits obtained from visits to second homes.

The aggregate nonmarket benefits of the use of the current summer home stock are considerable – about EUR 500 million per annum. The presence of algae that prevent aquatic recreation decreases the value per trip by 40 percent, and the lack of a beach reduces it by 45 percent; electrification increases the value by 3 – 5 percent.
