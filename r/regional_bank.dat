We study the role of <b>regional</b> <b>banking</b> system {{characteristics}} for <b>regional</b> <b>banking</b> system fragility. We find that <b>regional</b> <b>banking</b> system fragility reduces when banks in the region jointly hold more liquid assets, are better capitalized, and when <b>regional</b> <b>banking</b> systems are more competitive. For Asia and Latin-America, a greater presence of foreign <b>banks</b> also reduces <b>regional</b> <b>banking</b> fragility. We further investigate the possibility of contagion within and across regions. Within region banking contagion is important in all regions but it is substantially lower in the developed regions compared to emerging market regions. For cross-regional contagion, {{we find that the}} contagion effects of Europe and the US on Asia and Latin America are significantly higher compared to the effect of Asia and Latin America among themselves. Finally, the impact of cross-regional contagion is attenuated when the host region has a more liquid and more capitalized banking sector. ...|$|R

In particular, by pooling prefecture-level data, the market characteristics of prefectures that experience more entrances by non-local <b>regional</b> <b>banks</b> compared with other prefectures are examined.

Therefore, it can be considered that non-local <b>regional</b> <b>banks</b> that are not satisfied with lending opportunities in their home prefectures enter other prefectures to increase their lending opportunities to high-performing companies. This study contributes by clarifying why many <b>regional</b> <b>banks</b> do not concentrate on businesses within their local regions and intentionally enter other prefectures, which is in contrast with the intent of the region-based relationship banking policy. ...|$|R

40|$|Amid the {{economic}} recovery and the progressive unwinding of cross-shareholdings, foreign investors have been active buyers of Japanese equities, including not only shares of major banks but also of <b>regional</b> <b>banks,</b> particularly the upper-ranking ones. Among the leading 10 <b>regional</b> <b>banks,</b> the proportion of shares held by foreign investors rose from 5. 6 % {{at the end of}} March 2000 to 15. 0 % at the end of March 2005. In this paper we have confirmed, by means of panel analysis, that the capital adequacy ratio and the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans are significant as variables determining the market capitalization of the upper-ranking <b>regional</b> <b>banks.</b> In addition, the principal components of the business performance of <b>regional</b> <b>banks</b> are extracted by using principal component analysis, a method of multivariate analysis. In this way we have confirmed that with respect to the leading <b>regional</b> <b>banks</b> there is a significant positive relationship between the principal component score and the proportion of shares held by foreign investors. As a result of the increase in the liquidity of equities, at those same <b>regional</b> <b>banks</b> a significant difference has arisen in the composition of their shareholders and the effectiveness of their governance.

Moreover, although he was up for reelection in 1856 when the company was moving to Philadelphia, he chose to decline the offer.

[...] Under his administration, the original line opened in 1855. It stretched from Easton to Mauch Chunk, a region now known as Jim Thorpe. Additionally, Porter was invested in the natural resource industry. He organized a company called Northampton Quarry Company in 1817 in order to purchase and work a slate quarry near the bank of the Delaware River in Upper Mount Bethel County. By the 1830s, the company had expanded its reach and was renamed the Pennsylvania Slate Company. Additionally, Porter had similar investments in limestone quarries, coal mines, and a few mines involving the extraction of iron ore. Furthermore, Porter was involved in two commercial endeavors.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine how the {{risk-taking}} behavior differed between Korean <b>regional</b> <b>banks</b> and national banks for the two different regulatory regimes; a very loose regulation period (1994 - 1997) and a very tightened regulation period (1998 - 2005). From the panel analysis over the period 1994 - 2005, we found that <b>regional</b> <b>banks</b> took riskier strategies than national banks when banking regulations are loose. Moreover, their higher risk-taking contributed to higher profit under the period of loose regulation. However, after the banking regulations were tightened after financial crisis around the late 1990 s, this phenomenon disappeared and the tendency of <b>regional</b> <b>banks</b> to take greater risk than national banks was not observed any more. Also, the positive relationship between risk-taking and profitability was not observed either after regulations were tightened. These empirical findings would have the following policy implications. When the economic conditions are good, and therefore, banking regulations are relatively loose, the greater risk-taking of <b>regional</b> <b>banks</b> could be profitable, because <b>regional</b> <b>banks</b> are in a better situation in terms of maintaining their market share based on the close ties with their regional clients, and can be protected from excessive competition with national banks. But, if the economic conditions get worse and financial crisis occurs, and therefore, banking regulations get tightened, <b>regional</b> <b>banks</b> are more adversely and sensitively affected by these shocks than national banks because their size is small and their assets are less diversified than national banks, especially being concentrated on loans to small and medium size business sector and real estate loans, which are very sensitive to the fluctuation of the economy. Furthermore, if these adverse economic and financial shocks continue long, the probability of <b>regional</b> <b>banks</b> to fail would be substantially higher and it can cause a serious damage to the regional economy.
