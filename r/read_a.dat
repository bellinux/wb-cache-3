50|$|One {{can easily}} {{see that the}} two {{variables}} (<b>reading</b> <b>A</b> and <b>reading</b> B) are strongly related, and thus dependent on each other. Readers of <b>A</b> tend to <b>read</b> B more often (52%) than non-readers of <b>A</b> (28%). If <b>reading</b> <b>A</b> and B were independent, then the formula P(A&B) = P(A)&times;P(B) would hold. But 260/1000 isn't 400/1000 &times; 500/1000. Thus, <b>reading</b> <b>A</b> and B are statistically dependent on each other.|$|R

5|$|Although {{she writes}} under the pen name J. K. Rowling (pronounced rolling), her name, before her remarriage, was simply Joanne Rowling. Anticipating that the target {{audience}} of young boys {{might not want to}} <b>read</b> <b>a</b> book written by a woman, her publishers asked that she use two initials rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose K (for Kathleen) as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother. She calls herself Jo. Following her remarriage, she has sometimes used the name Joanne Murray when conducting personal business. During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence under the name of Joanne Kathleen Rowling and her entry in Who's Who lists her name also as Joanne Kathleen Rowling.|$|E
