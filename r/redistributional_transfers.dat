40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to the welfare {{analysis}} of voluntary and opt-out mandatory set-aside policies relying on the incentive theory under adverse selection. Differently from Bourgeon et al. [1995], farms are composed of homogeneous yield plots. Optimal regulation by price and set-aside leads to theoretical and numerical results for soft wheat and low quality wine markets. Price adjustment limits the social cost due to the producers' information rent involving <b>redistributional</b> <b>transfers</b> between producers, consumers and taxpayers. ...|$|E
40|$|We study an overlapping-generations {{experiment}} with multiple families in which <b>redistributional</b> <b>transfers</b> {{can take the}} form of support to the elderly or grants to children. Supporting the old is a purely inter-generational (intra-family) transfer, whereas grants to children also involve an element of intra-generational (inter-family) solidarity. Our treatment variable is the tax rate determining the amount of redistribution by means of the compulsory pension scheme. We investigate to which degree compulsory solidarity crowds out voluntary solidarity. We also consider whether voluntary solidarity relies more on grants to children or on support to the old aged, and the mechanisms which are used in eliciting transfers from family members from other generations. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the role of}} social safety nets {{in the form of}} <b>redistributional</b> <b>transfers</b> and wage subsidies. It argues that public welfare programs can be viewed as devices to prevent crime or disruption because they tend to increase the opportunity cost of engaging in crime or disruptive activities. It is shown that, {{in the presence of a}} leisure choice, wage subsidies may be better than pure transfers. Using a simple growth model, the optimal size of the public welfare program is found, and it is argued that public welfare should be financed with income (not lump-sum) taxes, despite the fact that income taxes are distortionary. The intuition for this result is that income taxes act as a user fee on congested public goods and transfers can be thought of as productive public goods subject to congestion. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the sources of}} differences in social mobility between the U. S. and Denmark. Measured by income mobility, Denmark is a more mobile society, but not when measured by educational mobility. There are pronounced nonlinearities in income and educational mobility in both countries. Greater Danish income mobility is largely a consequence of <b>redistributional</b> tax, <b>transfer,</b> and wage compression policies. While Danish social policies for children produce more favorable cognitive test scores for disadvantaged children, these do not translate into more favorable educational outcomes, partly because of disincentives to acquire education arising from the redistributional policies that increase income mobility...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{substantial}} regional expenditures at {{both national}} and community level, European regional policies {{do not appear}} to deliver. The evidence suggests that neither efficiency gains nor reduced regional inequalities are attained. If there is any positive impact at all, then it is at the most a <b>redistributional</b> one. If <b>transfers</b> are mainly <b>redistributional</b> in nature, would policies based on non-distortionary financing be a better route to follow? We ask what are the alternatives to a distortionary regional policy forcing the delocation of activity. Are non-distortionary policies always more efficient than distortionary alternatives? We analyse these questions employing a new economic geography model, where we also take into account the importance of knowledge spillovers for productivity, industry location and policy. It is shown that the effectiveness of different regional policy depends on (i) intra-industry knowledge spillovers, (ii) inter-industry knowledge spillovers, and (iii) trade costs. Our analysis provides insight into what may be the reason for the lack of success of EU regional initiative. EU; knowledge spillovers; new economic geography; Regional policy...|$|R

40|$|The role {{of social}} safety nets {{in the form}} of <b>redistributional</b> <b>transfers</b> and wage {{subsidies}} is analyzed using a simple model of criminal behavior. It is argued that public welfare programs act as a crime [...] preventing or disruption [...] preventing devices because they tend to increase the opportunity cost of engaging in crime or disruptive activities. It is shown that, {{in the presence of a}} leisure choice, wage subsidies may be better than pure transfers. Using a simple growth model, it is shown that it is not optimal for the government to try to fully eliminate crime. The optimal size of the public welfare program is found and it is argued that public welfare should be financed with income (not lump [...] sum) taxes, despite the fact that income taxes are distortionary.

40|$|There is {{a healthy}} debate about how to achieve poverty {{reduction}} in developing countries, but not enough discussion of {{what we mean by}} “poverty reduction. ” “Poverty reduction” is often used as a short-hand for promoting economic growth that will permanently lift {{as many people as possible}} over a poverty line. But there are many different objectives that are consistent with “poverty reduction,” and we have to make choices between them. There are trade-offs between tackling current and future poverty, between helping as many poor people as possible and focusing on those in chronic poverty, and between measures that tackle the causes of poverty and those which deal with the symptoms. Because donors focus on just one dimension of poverty reduction (growth) they marginalise other legitimate objectives such as reducing chronic poverty or providing social services in countries that cannot otherwise afford them. Because donor agencies do not recognize these different objectives explicitly, there are important negative consequences for the choice and management of individual aid programmes, and for donors’ ability to make transparent and evidence-based decisions about the composition of their portfolio. Aid could be more effective if there were greater recognition of the different dimensions of poverty reduction and if this was recognized in the objectives for and incentives in aid agencies. There is an ethical case for a global system of social justice that provides long-term, <b>redistributional</b> <b>transfers</b> of resources to the world’s poor, to enable them to lead better lives while their country is developing, even if there is no expectation that these transfers will accelerate economic development. Reasonable people can disagree about whether this is desirable but the existing hegemonic definition of poverty reduction does not sufficiently acknowledge this as a legitimate goal or permit a meaningful discourse about how it might be achieved. poverty reduction, growth, donors...|$|E
