In this study, the relationship between the liquid water distribution and operating condition of fuel cell was examined by experiments with visualized cell and numerical analysis. As a result, {{it was found that the}} position and the amount of the liquid water in porous media made a great impact on the output performance.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the experimental results on heat transfer characteristics of air forced convection over two ribbed not-thin plates and a flat plate for comparison, obtained by infrared thermography. This technique is attractive {{because it allows}} a full-field, non-contact, high spatial resolution, measurement of the surface temperature and heat transfer coefficient distribution if heat flux distribution is given. In the present case, heat flux is known but at a some depth from the surface convectively cooled while heat diffusion through the plate being not negligible. In this paper, we first present the procedure for processing thermographic images and then thermal performances of two roughened surfaces with square cross-section ribs perpendicularly arranged to airflow, with two values of the corrugation pitch to <b>rib</b> <b>side</b> ratio, i. e., 33. 3 and 13. 3. Convection data are for air flows at room temperature with a speed between 2. 3 and 11. 6 m/s, corresponding to ReL ranging from 31000 to 155000, and for heat fluxes between 650 and 820 W/m 2...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present new {{experimental}} results of investigation on average heat transfer {{characteristics of a}} forced air-flow through a rectangular channel with the lower and upper surfaces roughened by ribs; data for a rectangular channel with flat surfaces are also presented for comparison. The channel has a 120 mm wide, 12 mm high cross-section, and it is operated with the lower and upper walls at fixed temperature whereas the side ones are adiabatic. Ribs have a square cross section and are mounted transversely to air-flow direction; the tested configurations differ for the <b>rib</b> <b>side</b> dimension, namely, 2 or 4 mm, and for their pitch-to-side ratio equal to 10, 20 and 40. Upstream the test channel, there is an entry-section consisting of a 800 mm long, rectangular duct with the same transverse dimensions as the test section but with flat and adiabatic walls, in order to attain developed velocity conditions at the test channel entry. Air flow rates have been varied in order to investigate Reynolds numbers, based on the duct hydraulic diameter, between 700 and 7500. The average Nusselt numbers are evaluated {{on the basis of}} the air-flow bulk-temperature at entrance and exit from the heated zone, as well as of the surface temperature measured by eight T-type thermocouples plugged into the heated walls. The test section is also equipped with static pressure taps placed at the heated zone ends. Results show an increase of the average Nusselt number for the tested ribbed channels ranging between 1. 1 and 4. 6 with respect to the flat channel...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the process of}} design of a frame for a semi low loader for the transportation of oversize loads, especially wheeled and tracked machines. After considering different solutions of a frame, a central beam was chosen and an initial design was developed. The initial model of the frame was analyzed {{with the use of}} FEM and was then modified. Two final versions of the frame were prepared. One of them was used in a 4 axle trailer with a load deck that can be extended in length and width to carry oversize and heavy loads. An important advantage of the trailer is its versatility and the fact that in a non-extended state it meets the regulations for standard trailers and can carry loads without a special permission. The paper focuses on the application of FEM analysis {{in the design of the}} part of the beam where highest stresses were located.

40|$|Although {{the room}} and pillar mining method is world-known and widely used, {{in terms of the}} Czech coal mines located in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin it is still in the testing phase. Unfavourable mining, {{geotechnical}} conditions at large depths and the ban by Czech mining authorities prevented this method from being used on rock bolt reinforcement without other roof support. Typically, large amounts of unexploited coal reserves are left in the shaft protective pillars. This coal can be mined if strata subsidence is minimised. Due to its low subsidence characteristics {{the room and}} pillar mining method without pillar extraction has been trialled at the CSM Coal Mine at the end of 2014. During the pillar development phase complex geotechnical monitoring was undertaken including the frequent scanning of pillar movement using 3 D laser scanning technology. The laser scanner enabled complex capture of the entire space around the monitored pillars during the period of pillar formation and afterwards. The time-lapse scanning method measured changes in the mine roadway surface profiles including pillar displacements, roof movements, floor heave and other dynamic phenomena. The time-lapse scanning indicated variable pillar rib movement ranging from a few cm to a maximum of 50 cm with an average of approximately 25 to 30 cm. The scans indicated that the bottom of the seam displaced more than the top of the <b>rib</b> <b>side</b> due to large floor heave. The weak floor consisting of siltstone and coal beds experienced large floor heave however, due to floor brushing no reliable floor displacements are available. In contrast to the large movements in the rib and the floor, the strong roof strata did not show any significant movements. The purpose of this work is to highlight the importance of terrestrial laser scanning as an essential engineering design tool to evaluate the displacements and deformations of mine excavations at large depths. The 3 D scanning results gave relevant information about displacements and deformations that occurred at the tested site and thereby helped to improve safety underground...|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims {{to develop}} a rock mass {{classification}} system for UK Coal Measure strata such that the output from the classification system may provide {{a means by which}} the strength and stiffness properties of Coal Measure strata encountered within UK coal mines may be predicted. The development of the Coal Mine Classification system is described within this thesis. A structured methodology utilising a database of information obtained from 118 different rock mass classifications, together with consideration of the typical mechanisms of strata deformation within coal mines, was employed to determine the parameters of the Coal Measure strata that have the greatest influence on the engineering properties of the strata. These identified parameters have formed the basis of the Coal Mine Classification system. By comparison to a series of conceptual models of strata deformation that occur within the roof,floor, ribs of roadways and within the region of the coal face, relative importance weightings and rating scales for the identified classification parameters have been proposed. The anisotropic nature of the UK Coal Measures is characterised within the Coal Mine Classification by the calculation of separate ratings for directions parallel to and perpendicular to bedding. An appraisal of the optimum method of using the classification ratings, determined by the Coal Mine Classification, to predict the strength properties of individual strata units was undertaken. Rock mass failure criteria that utilise outputs from existing rock mass classification systems to determine the rock mass strength, have been reviewed. Utilising published triaxial data the rock mass failure criterion that best predicts the failure characteristics of UK Coal Measure strata was identified. From this study the Hoek-Brown rock mass failure criterion was identified as the optimum existing criterion for predicting the intact strength and rock mass strength of Coal Measure strata. However this criterion was still found not to produce a close fit in many cases to the intact failure strength of the strata. A modified Coal Measure Failure criterion has been developed, which {{for a wide range of}} Coal Measure rock types was found to produce a better prediction of the intact strength of Coal Measure strata than any of the existing rock mass failure criteria. To determine the efficacy of the Coal Mine Classification system as a means of predicting the strength and stiffness properties of the rock mass the Coal Mine Classification was applied to the strata at case study localities within rock bolted roadways within three UK mine sites. Numerical models of the case study localities were developed using the FLAC finite difference code utilising a ubiquitous jointed elastic-perfectly plastic material model to simulate strata behaviour. The output from the modelling included predicted roof and <b>rib</b> <b>side</b> displacements, and these displacements were compared to the actual monitoring data for the case study localities. The results of the numerical modelling indicate that the predictions produced by the numerical models reflected the pattern and scale of deformations actually measured in-situ within the coal mine roadways, thus indicating that the Coal Mine Classification system provides a means of predictively determining the engineering properties of the in-situ Coal Measure strata. The modelling also indicated that time delays related to the installation of the roof extensometers may under predict that actual roof deformation that occurs within the roadway roof...|$|E

40|$|Oncoprotein 18 /stathmin (Op 18), a {{regulator}} of microtubule dynamics, was recombinantly expressed and {{its structure}} and function analysed. We report that Op 18 by itself can fold into a flexible and extended α-helix, which is in equilibrium with a less ordered structure. In complex with tubulin, however, all except the last seven C-terminal residues of Op 18 are tightly bound to tubulin. Digital image analysis of Op 18 :tubulin electron micrographs revealed that the complex consists of two longitudinally aligned α/β-tubulin heterodimers. The appearance of the complex {{was that of a}} kinked protofilament-like structure with a flat and a <b>ribbed</b> <b>side.</b> Deletion mapping of Op 18 further demonstrated that (i) the function of the N-terminal part of the molecule is to ‘cap’ tubulin subunits to ensure the specificity of the complex and (ii) the complete C-terminal α-helical domain of Op 18 is necessary and sufficient for stable Op 18 :tubulin complex formation. Together, our results suggest that besides sequestering tubulin, the structural features of Op 18 enable the protein specifically to recognize microtubule ends to trigger catastrophes...|$|R
