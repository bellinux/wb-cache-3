5|$|In 2003, it {{was decided}} that Norway was to extend its {{operations}} in Antarctica by establishing an all-year <b>research</b> <b>station.</b> By then, Norway was the only country with a territorial claim to Antarctica to not have an all-year <b>research</b> <b>station</b> on the continent. The government stated that the investment was motivated to improve climate research, to strengthen Norway as a bi-polar research nation and to strengthen Norway's role as a premise-maker in the environmental policy of the Antarctic.|$|E

5|$|Following William Beebe's {{death in}} 1962, his <b>research</b> <b>station</b> at Simla {{remained}} in operation under Jocelyn Crane's management, {{under the new}} name of the William Beebe Tropical <b>Research</b> <b>Station.</b> However, because Jocelyn's research required her to travel north for extended periods, by 1965 she had little time to keep the station running. By 1971, the station had fallen into disuse and was declared closed. Meanwhile, as Asa Wright's health began to fail in her old age, her friends began to fear that after her death her neighboring estate of Spring Hill might be lost to developers, and established a trust to buy the estate and convert it into the Asa Wright nature center. In 1974, Beebe's property was donated to the newly established Asa Wright Nature Center.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Norwegian {{authorities}} {{decided to}} extend its operations in Antarctica by establishing an all-year <b>research</b> <b>station.</b> By then, Norway was the only country with a territorial claim to Antarctica to not have an all-year <b>research</b> <b>station</b> on the continent. Construction was carried out from December 2004 through February 2005. To ease logistics, Norway took the initiative to establish Dronning Maud Land Air Network (DROMLAN), a cooperation between the countries with bases in Queen Maud Land to streamline transport costs. The permanent Troll Airfield was opened on 11 February 2005.|$|E
5|$|The {{starship}} USS Enterprise {{arrives at}} planet M-113 to provide medical exams for Professor Robert Crater (Alfred Ryder) {{and his wife}} Nancy (Jeanne Bal), who operate a <b>research</b> <b>station</b> there. Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Chief Medical Officer Dr. Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley), and Crewman Darnell (Michael Zaslow) transport to the surface as Kirk teases McCoy about his affection for Nancy Crater ten years earlier. They arrive in the <b>research</b> <b>station,</b> {{and each of the}} three men see Nancy differently: McCoy as she was when he first met her, Kirk as she should look accounting for her age, and Darnell as a totally different, attractive younger woman. Kirk sends the dazed Darnell outside; when Nancy goes out to fetch her husband, she beckons Darnell to follow her.|$|E
5|$|With {{the loss}} of their station on Bermuda, Beebe and Elswyth gave up on their {{compromise}} of finding a <b>research</b> <b>station</b> where they could both be happy. Elswyth, who was most content in temperate environments, began searching for a home in New England where she could continue her writing. Meanwhile, Beebe began searching for a new tropical <b>research</b> <b>station</b> to replace Kartabo, which had fallen victim to deforestation just like Kalacoon before it. Beebe eventually helped Elswyth purchase a small farm near Wilmington, Vermont, where he visited her frequently. Elswyth explained in a magazine interview that she was uncomfortable on Beebe's expeditions, so {{the two of them had}} agreed that they would keep their careers separate from their private lives.|$|E

5|$|Alvarez {{spent the}} summer of 1943 in England testing GCA, landing planes {{returning}} from battle in bad weather, and also training the British {{in the use of}} the system. While there he encountered the young Arthur C. Clarke, who was an RAF radar technician. Clarke subsequently used his experiences at the radar <b>research</b> <b>station</b> as the basis for his novel Glide Path, which contains a thinly disguised version of Alvarez. Clarke and Alvarez developed a long-term friendship.|$|E
5|$|Avondale Agriculture <b>Research</b> <b>Station</b> or Avondale Discovery Farm {{is one of}} {{thirteen}} research farms and stations operated by Western Australia's Department of Agriculture and Food.

5|$|Each year, {{scientists}} from 28 different nations conduct experiments not reproducible {{in any other}} place in the world. In the summer more than 4,000 scientists operate research stations; this number decreases to just over 1,000 in the winter.

5|$|Fleming made {{a number}} of revelations about Bond's {{character}} within the book, including showing an emotional side that was not present in the previous stories. In common with Fleming's other Bond stories, he used the names and places of people he knew or had heard of and Blofeld's <b>research</b> <b>station</b> on Piz Gloria was based on Schloss Mittersill, which the Nazis had turned into a research establishment examining the Asiatic races.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Osborn helped secure Beebe a new <b>research</b> <b>station</b> in Guiana {{to replace}} Kalacoon: Beebe was offered Kartabo Point, an outpost of a New York-based mining corporation. Beebe was {{enthusiastic}} about the new station, and it proved very successful for conducting the same detailed analyses of wildlife within small areas that had been performed at Kalacoon. At Kartabo Beebe discovered the phenomenon known as an ant mill, a column of ants following itself in an endless loop until {{nearly all of them}} died of exhaustion.|$|E

The Metroid hatchling sacrifices itself to save Samus, and Samus in turn defeats Mother Brain and escapes as the entire planet is destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The first {{large-scale}} production of penicillin {{took place in}} the town. In 1938 Howard Florey was working at Lincoln College, Oxford University with Ernst Boris Chain and Norman Heatley, when he read Alexander Fleming's paper discussing the antibacterial effects of Penicillium notatum mould. He made arrangements for this to be grown in deep culture tanks at the Medical Research Council's Antibiotic <b>Research</b> <b>Station</b> in Clevedon, enabling mass production of this mould for the injections of the forthcoming soldiers of World War II who suffered from infections.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{permanent}} population, {{although there are}} 12 active research stations housing a maximum average of 40 scientists, the numbers fluctuating depending on the season. Six are occupied year-round, while the remainder are seasonal summer stations. The main aerodromes for intercontinental flights, corresponding with Cape Town, South Africa, are Troll Airfield, near the Norwegian Troll <b>research</b> <b>station,</b> and a runway at the Russian Novolazarevskaya Station.|$|E
5|$|These {{stations}} are connected by the Dronning Maud Land Air Network Project (DROMLAN), {{which is a}} cooperative agreement for transportation between eleven nations with research stations in East Antarctica. Long-range aircraft fly between Cape Town, South Africa and either the Troll Airfield, located at the Troll <b>research</b> <b>station,</b> or the runway at the Novolazarevskaya Station. From these two main airfields, smaller aircraft may fly further to other Antarctic destinations.|$|E
