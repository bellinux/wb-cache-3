40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} {{the concept of}} an algorithm to register specified markers on the neuroArm surgical manipulators, an image-guided MR-compatible tele-operated robot for microsurgery and stereotaxy. Two range-finding algorithms, namely time-of-flight and phase-shift, are evaluated for registration and supervisory control. The time-of-flight approach is implemented in a semi-field experiment to determine the precise position of a tiny retro-reflective moving object. The moving object simulates a surgical tool tip. The tool is a target that would be connected to the neuroArm end-effector during surgery inside the magnet bore of the MR imaging system. In order to apply flight approach, a 905 -nm pulsed laser diode and an avalanche photodiode are utilized as the transmitter and receiver, respectively. For the experiment, a high frequency time to digital converter was designed using a field-programmable gate arrays. In the phase-shift approach, a continuous green laser beam with a wavelength of 530 nm was used as the transmitter. Results showed that a positioning error of 0. 1 mm occurred when the scanner-target point distance was set in the range of 2. 5 to 3 meters. The effectiveness of this non-contact approach exhibited that the method could be employed as an alternative for conventional mechanical <b>registration</b> <b>arm.</b> Furthermore, the approach is not limited by physical contact and extension of joint angles...|$|E

40|$|Aerodynamics of trains running inside tunnels change more {{significantly}} {{in comparison with}} open air scenarios. It has been confirmed that the lateral vibration {{as well as the}} aerodynamic drag of the trains is increased and the micropressure wave is produced at the tunnel exit when the trains are passing through tunnels. The aim {{of this article is to}} explore the impact of a high-speed train passing through a tunnel on the pantograph aerodynamics and the dynamic behavior of the pantograph–catenary interaction. The aerodynamic forces acting on the pantograph are investigated thoroughly by extensive numerical simulations as well as systematic field tests. To investigate the effects of the aerodynamic forces of pantograph on the quality of current collection, the numerical simulations of the pantograph–catenary dynamic interaction are conducted with our proposed model, taking into consideration the action of the aerodynamic uplift forces obtained by the numerical simulations on the pantograph. Then, a series of numerical simulations are also carried out to analyze the effects of the train speed and the blockage ratio on the aerodynamic uplift forces of the pantograph, on the contact forces, as well as on the displacement of the contact wire, while the train is passing through a tunnel. The results reveal that compared with the open air scenarios, the aerodynamic drag and uplift forces of the pantograph, the mean value of the contact force and the displacement level of the <b>registration</b> <b>arm</b> can considerably increase as the train runs inside a tunnel. Moreover, the statistical values of the contact forces and the displacement level of the contact wire become larger while the train is passing through the tunnel at different speeds. On the other hand, the quality of current collection decreases with the increasing of the blockage ratio...|$|E

30|$|For a {{humanitarian}} organisation, {{the primary goal}} is obviously to offer assistance to those most in need in as principled a manner as possible, and organisational effectiveness is evaluated against this primary goal. The challenge is how to evaluate goal-attainment in relation to engagement with the multiple constituencies in the arena. In this framework, constituency building is a two-way street, as is political action. This approach helps to define the actors that can be constructively dealt with and ones that try to co-opt humanitarian organisations by making them part of their constituency, such as donor governments making funding conditional on recipient humanitarian organisations supporting elements of their foreign policy priorities. Such an arena should {{be thought of as}} a matrix of interlocking constituencies, all of which have their own goals in mind. From the perspective of {{a humanitarian}} organisation, its primary constituency will of course be the beneficiaries. But when acting in a complex political context, there are others, such as donors, the states which provide legal <b>registration,</b> <b>armed</b> actors which allow operations, or the organisation’s staff.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Fast image {{registration}} for {{magnetic resonance image}} (MRI) -guided surgery using projection profile matching embedded in MR pulse sequence is proposed. The method can perform two-dimensional {{image registration}} by matching projection profiles acquired with zero-degree phase encoding. The matching process continuously measures displacement by optimizing cross correlation value from profiles acquired 64 times by a special pulse excitation and echo acquisition in one imaging cycle. A phantom experiment concluded that the method can perform the registration in 25 ms with the accuracy of 0. 50 mm out of 100 mm field of view. The paper also includes in-vivo experiment to <b>registration</b> MRI <b>arm</b> in motion. Unlike previously reported image registration by post-processing, the method is suitable in intraoperative setting where fast registration is in great need...|$|R

50|$|President Roxas {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} while visiting Clark Air Base in Pampanga and was succeeded by Elpidio Quirino. Quirino had a {{different}} policy in dealing with the rebels, and offered amnesty to the leaders and members of the PKM and the HMB. A large point of contention in this amnesty proclamation was the understanding that the Huks would be able to retain their arms, provided that they were duly registered with the government, as opposed to surrendering them. With this in mind, HMB leaders such as Taruc came down to accept amnesty on June 21, 1948. Amnesty talks occurred from June 21 to August 15, when negotiations broke down over the misunderstanding of <b>registration</b> of <b>arms</b> against its surrender. By August 15, Taruc had retired back to the fields, and negotiations had failed.|$|R

50|$|Since {{the modern}} {{republic}} of Iceland lacks a governing body {{to regulate the}} <b>registration</b> of heraldic <b>arms,</b> there is no heraldic armory registered as such other than the national arms, which were adopted by presidential decree upon gaining independence in 1944. Rather than actual coats of arms, municipalities carry logos which usually look vaguely like a coat of arms, but the rules of heraldry are not always observed and the results vary, ranging from such characteristically heraldic arms as those of Akureyri to such unheraldic logos as that of Djupivogur.|$|R

40|$|The {{illegal trade}} in {{ammunition}} in the Netherlands {{seems to be}} a small-scale problem. However, as a result of high profits and a small chance of being caught, it is an extremely attractive criminal activity for malicious individuals. The criminal purchase of ammunition is facilitated by weaknesses in the logistic supply chain for legal ammunition, current legislation on the purchase, possession, transport and use of ammunition and the inadequacy with which Dutch government agencies enforce the laws. The fight against the criminal purchase of ammunition could benefit from the adoption of an automated <b>registration</b> system by <b>arms</b> dealers, the use of a different type of freighting method for legal ammunition transport and a common approach by European law enforcement agencies. ...|$|R
5000|$|Despite no {{widespread}} regulation, heraldry {{has remained}} consistent across Europe, where tradition alone has governed {{the design and}} use of arms. Some nations, like England and Scotland, still maintain the same heraldic authorities which have traditionally granted and regulated arms for centuries and {{continue to do so}} in the present day. In England, for example, the granting of arms is and has been controlled by the College of Arms. Unlike seals and other general emblems, heraldic [...] "achievements" [...] have a formal description called a blazon, which uses vocabulary that allows for consistency in heraldic depictions. In the present day, coats of arms are still in use by a variety of institutions and individuals: for example, many European cities and universities have guidelines on how their coats of arms may be used, and protect their use as trademarks.

30|$|Fast {{tracking}} of pre-emptive HLP registration processes in vulnerable ‘at risk’ of displacement communities: The fast {{tracking of}} HLP registration might {{be achieved through}} formal or customary registration systems, community participatory mapping, or other contextually relevant methods (Unruh 2014). A standard HLP registration document might be developed for communities ‘at risk’ of displacement. These documents might be stored individually, for example, online. Research suggests that without evidence of ownership or occupancy {{it is difficult to}} protect HLP from being illegally appropriated through forced displacement. Consider an individual IDP, for example, attempting to establish the right to return, dispute the illegal occupancy of their home post-conflict, or simply provide evidence that they have been displaced from HLP where they were legally present. If customary HLP practices are dominated by criminal, patriarchal, or ethno-centric power structures then informal participatory mapping may provide discrete evidence of legal presence. HLP mapping, however, can be a formidable undertaking especially in conflict contexts, where at-risk communities may have limited education and live in impoverished conditions. Nevertheless, the value of micro-level <b>registration</b> is that <b>armed</b> parties may be deterred from displacing civilians from HLP and they may have difficulty retaining or trading. HLP registration systems, furthermore, have their own significant protective capacity.|$|R
5000|$|Completed grant {{documents}} are {{recorded in the}} register and the notice of the grant is published in the Canada Gazette. The register is divided up in volumes, with each volume being reserved for each serving Governor General since 1988. Volume I, from 1988 to 1990, is for arms granted during the term of Jeanne Sauvé, Volume II, from 1990 to 1995, is reserved for Ramon Hnatyshyn, Volume III is reserved for Roméo LeBlanc, who served from 1995 to 1999, Volume IV for Adrienne Clarkson, 1999-2005, and Volume V for Michaëlle Jean, 2005-2010. The current Governor General, David Johnston, has his grants entered into Volume VI. Requests for <b>registrations</b> of existing <b>arms</b> also {{take the form of}} a [...] "petition", as described above. The CHA will normally only register existing arms if the petitioner was unable to petition for a Canadian grant at the time the existing arms were granted, i.e., the arms of immigrants or arms granted to Canadians before the creation of the CHA in 1988. In addition, the existing arms must normally come from a source recognized by the Chief Herald (e.g. the Chief Herald of Ireland, College of Arms, Lord Lyon, the South African Bureau of Heraldry, etc.). Registration {{documents are}} recorded in the Public Register, and the notice of the registration is published in the Gazette. If the petitioner so desires, their design can be published in the Trade Marks Journal. That can be arranged through the offices of the Authority, but a separate fee is required which is paid to the Registrar of Trade Marks.|$|R
40|$|Work-related {{shoulder}} disorders {{represent a}} significant subset of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Shoulder tendinitis {{has a high}} prevalence in major populations of employees. There is an urgent need for hints and directions on how to evaluate risks for developing chronic work-related shoulder disorders, {{as well as for}} methods of assessing hazardous working conditions. The aims of this work were to assess usability and accuracy in techniques and methods for exploring arm positions and shoulder muscle activity and to investigate the pattern of shoulder muscle interplay regarding voluntary control. The aims were also to elucidate the relations between the external physical demands originating from working tasks and internal load on different structures in the shoulder and to propose a model for estimating the risk of developing acute and chronic work-related musculoskeletal disorders of the shoulder, by using observable data which characterize the exposure. Electromyography (EMG) and intramuscular pressure (IMP) measurements were used to assess shoulder muscle activity. Bipolar electrodes were used for acquisition of EMG from the superficial muscles and for deep lying muscles indwelling wire electrodes were used. Acquisition of IMP was accomplished by microcapillary infusion technique. A 3 D motion analysis system (MacReflex) has been used for control and <b>registration</b> of <b>arm</b> postures. The results indicate that IMP and EMG measurements produce similar estimates of muscle load and that there were substantial differences in IMP generation between shoulder muscles. Extremely high IMPs were recorded in the supraspinatus muscle. The MacReflex motion analysis system was found to produce position data with an angle error less than 1. 8 (in biomechanical and ergonomic application. It was demonstrated that the activity of the descending part of the trapezius muscle could be voluntarily reduced to 56 % of the initial activity, without altering external conditions, and that {{the main part of the}} trapezius load was transferred to the rhomboid major and minor and the transverse part of the trapezius. IMP measurements showed that accumulated muscle fatigue might occur in the infra- and/or supraspinatus, if the upper arm exceeds 30 (of arm elevation and that impaired muscle blood flow might occur if the upper arm exceeds 50 (. In the validation of the biomechanical shoulder model, it was established that the shoulder muscle forces estimated by the model acceptably agree with the shoulder muscle forces estimated by the EMG measurements, except for the levator scapulae and the supraspinatus, where estimations from EMG measurements were 53 % and 207 %, respectively, of the activity calculated by the model. In conclusion: feedback assisted reduction of trapezius activity will affect other shoulder muscles, MacReflex motion analysis system possesses adequate accuracy for biomechanical and ergonomic purposes and IMP recordings from the infra- and supraspinatus indicate the necessity of restricted arm positions in static or repetitive work...|$|R
