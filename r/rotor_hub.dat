5|$|Following a {{cross-country}} flight to Wright Field in Ohio from Platt-LePage's Pennsylvania plant, {{testing of the}} XR-1A continued until a mechanical failure in the <b>rotor</b> <b>hub</b> led to a crash landing on 26 October 1944, the company deciding to sell the wreckage for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Like the US AH-64D Apache Longbow, the Apache AH1 {{carries a}} fire-control radar (FCR) and Radar Frequency Interferometer (RFI), {{providing}} an integrated surveillance and attack system. The 'Longbowâ€™ radar is the bulbous unit over the <b>rotor</b> <b>hub</b> assembly; radar placement above the rotors allows the Apache to hover behind cover scanning for targets, {{with only the}} radar unit exposed. Additionally, the Longbow radar can monitor traffic in the Apache's airspace. The radar {{can also be used}} for surveillance and terrain profiling. A modem is interfaced into the Longbow radar and other sensor systems to relay information to other aircraft, this allows other Apaches to fire on targets identified by only a single helicopter.|$|E
50|$|To {{lessen the}} loads, {{especially}} the rapid changes, the <b>rotor</b> <b>hubs</b> included {{a system of}} bearings {{that allow them to}} move forward or back in response to drag, and up and down in a flapping motion in response to changing speed. These were in addition to the system used to change the angle of attack to provide control; <b>rotor</b> <b>hubs</b> tended to be very complex.|$|R
50|$|The chassis with MacPherson strut {{front and}} {{multilink}} rear suspension was {{common to all}} S13 and RS13 models. The European 200SX initially had 257mm front brakes and rear disc service brakes with drum parking brakes in the <b>rotor</b> <b>hubs.</b> Later models had larger 280mm front brakes.|$|R
50|$|The Safari is a two-seat light {{helicopter}} with {{a bubble}} canopy, a two-bladed main rotor and a skid landing gear. The aircraft structure consists predominantly of welded 4130 chromoly steel tubing. The kit provides the main and tail <b>rotors,</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>hubs,</b> transmission, engine, cockpit and tailboom completed. Builder construction is largely assembly.|$|R
5|$|With {{the worst}} of the aircraft's {{problems}} believed to have been resolved, the XR-1 was submitted for service testing by the Army Air Forces in 1943. During the course of the Army's evaluations, the XR-1's empennage failed during structural testing, the surfaces being strengthened as a result and testing, following the repairs, resuming in 1944. Despite the modifications to the design, however, the XR-1 still proved to be deficient in control authority. In July 1943, the XR-1 program suffered a setback when the aircraft crashed, seriously injuring test pilot Jim Ray, who had replaced Leavitt following the latter's dismissal from the company. The crash was caused by an inspector's error in leaving a suspect part on the aircraft, the <b>rotor</b> <b>hub</b> failing in flight {{as a result of the}} decision. The aircraft was repairable, but it would be a year before the XR-1 was ready to fly again.|$|E
25|$|Delta Air Lines Flight 1288: a McDonnell Douglas MD-88 {{flying from}} Pensacola, Florida to Atlanta in 1996 had a cracked {{compressor}} <b>rotor</b> <b>hub</b> failure {{on one of}} its Pratt & Whitney JT8D-219 engines. 2 died.|$|E
25|$|The Bell 427 {{is powered}} by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PW207D {{turboshaft}} engines with FADEC. Like the Bell 407, the 427 uses a four-blade main rotor system with a rigid, composite <b>rotor</b> <b>hub</b> and a two-blade tail rotor.|$|E
50|$|In 1946, Brantly started {{flight testing}} the B-1 {{prototype}} (NX69125), which used a 150 hp Franklin O-335 engine {{in the fabric}} fuselage and two three-bladed rotors that rotated at 320 rpm and were fitted coaxially. The collective, cyclic, and differential controls were enclosed in the <b>rotor</b> <b>hubs</b> and ran in an oil-bath. Each rotor blade weighed 5.5 kilos. It also had a fixed wheel undercarriage with a tailwheel under the tailfin.|$|R
40|$|A ground {{vibration}} test {{was performed on}} the AH- 64 (Apache) helicopter to determine the frequency response of the airframe. The structure was excited at both the main and tail <b>rotor</b> <b>hubs,</b> separately, and response measurements were taken at 102 locations throughout the fuselage structure. Frequency responses were compared and correlated with results from a NASTRAN finite element model of AH- 64. In addition, natural frequencies and mode shapes were estimated from the frequency response data and were correlated with analytical results...|$|R
5000|$|Tandem rotor {{aerodynamics}} is {{a complex}} subject. Tandem rotor helicopters {{have the advantage of}} being able to hold more weight with shorter blades, since there are two sets. However, the rear rotor works in the aerodynamic shadow of the front rotor, which reduces its efficiency. This loss can be minimized by increasing the distance between the two <b>rotor</b> <b>hubs,</b> and by elevating one hub over the other. [...] Tandem rotor helicopters tend to have a lower disk loading than single rotor helicopters.|$|R
25|$|They first {{produced}} an enlarged, six-occupant {{version of the}} Fw 61, designated Fa 226 Hornisse (Hornet), while contracting out development of the engine, transmission, and <b>rotor</b> <b>hub</b> to BMW's Berlin works. The Fa 226 was the world's first transport helicopter and was ordered by Lufthansa in 1938.|$|E
25|$|The OH-1 {{is powered}} by a pair of Mitsubishi TS1 {{turboshaft}} engines, equipped with Full Authority Digital Engine Controls (FADEC), which drives a four-blade composite main rotor with a bearingless <b>rotor</b> <b>hub</b> along with a Fenestron-type anti-torque tail rotor (an enclosed tail-fan unit). The Fenestron uses eight asymmetrically-spaced blades to reduce both noise and vibration.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the man-carrying machine known as a Rotachute, {{also known as a}} Hafner H.8, evolved from November 1940 and {{throughout}} 1941. In September 1941, the Central Landing Establishment was renamed the Airborne Forces Establishment. The Rotachute Mark I design initially comprised a tubular steel framework with a single seat, rubber-mounted <b>rotor</b> <b>hub,</b> hanging control column, skid undercarriage, and a self-inflating rear fairing made of rubberised fabric with integral tailplane. The two rotor blades, of wooden construction, could achieve flapping and coning characteristics via hinges on the <b>rotor</b> <b>hub.</b> Fixed footrests were provided, plus fittings below the seat to accommodate a soldier's weapon, such as a Bren gun. The control column offered two-axis control, rolling and pitching, with turns made via controlled rolling movement. Air Ministry Specification No. 11/42 was issued retrospectively to describe the outline requirements. The Ministry of Aircraft Production sub-contracted construction of parts to specialist firms including F. Hills and Sons, Airwork General Trading, Dynaflex, Dunlop, and H. Morris & Co. Some full size rotor trials were carried out using a pivoting rig mounted on a Ford flatbed truck, and full-size unmanned airframes were used in ground-based and inflight trials.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 January 2010, Sikorsky Aircraft {{opened a}} $20 million Precision Components Technology Center in Stratford, Connecticut, which {{will focus on}} {{production}} of the CH-53K. [...] This facility will produce the rotating and stationary swashplates, main and tail <b>rotor</b> <b>hubs,</b> and main <b>rotor</b> sleeves among other parts. [...] On 3 August 2010, the CH-53K passed Critical Design Review (CDR), and the program is ready for test production. [...] However, the IOC fielding date was deferred to 2018. Sikorsky had proposed to build four pre-production aircraft for operational evaluations.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} in the Langley full-scale tunnel to determine the parasite drag of five production-type helicopter <b>rotor</b> <b>hubs.</b> Some simple fairing arrangements were attempted {{in an effort to}} reduce the hub drag. The results indicate that, within the range of the tests, changes in angle of attack, hub rotational speed, and forward speed generally had only a small effect on the equivalent flat-plate area representing parasite drag. The drag coefficients of the basic hubs, based on projected hub frontal area, increased with hub area and varied from 0. 5 to 0. 76 for the hubs tested...|$|R
5000|$|Modern rotor {{systems may}} use the {{combined}} principles of the rotor systems mentioned above. Some <b>rotor</b> <b>hubs</b> incorporate a flexible hub, which allows for blade bending (flexing) {{without the need for}} bearings or hinges. These systems, called [...] "flexures", are usually constructed from composite material. Elastomeric bearings may also be used in place of conventional roller bearings. Elastomeric bearings are constructed from a rubber type material and provide limited movement that is perfectly suited for helicopter applications. Flexures and elastomeric bearings require no lubrication and, therefore, require less maintenance. They also absorb vibration, which means less fatigue and longer service life for the helicopter components.|$|R
25|$|A {{crash in}} February 1926, caused by blade root failure, {{led to an}} {{improvement}} in <b>rotor</b> <b>hub</b> design. A drag hinge was added {{in conjunction with the}} flapping hinge to allow each blade to move fore and aft and relieve in-plane stresses, generated as a byproduct of the flapping motion. This development led to the Cierva C.8, which, on 18 September 1928, made the first rotorcraft crossing of the English Channel followed by a tour of Europe.|$|E
25|$|The lack of {{a gearbox}} and the {{simplified}} rotor coupling to the aircraft meant that the design could employ a tilting <b>rotor</b> <b>hub,</b> and did not need drag hinges. The low torque coupling at the mast meant that very little was needed {{in the form of}} lateral control. The P.74 rotor was expected to be quieter in operation than tip jets, following tests with a Derwent engine powered rotor. The stainless-steel rotors were thick in cross section to accommodate the necessary ducting to the tips. They also were non-feathering, so ailerons were fitted to the blades.|$|E
25|$|De la Cierva's early autogyros were {{fitted with}} fixed rotor hubs, small fixed wings, and control {{surfaces}} {{like those of}} a fixed-wing aircraft. At low airspeeds, the control surfaces became ineffective and could readily lead to loss of control, particularly during landing. In response, Cierva developed a direct control <b>rotor</b> <b>hub,</b> which could be tilted in any direction by the pilot. De la Cierva's direct control was first developed on the Cierva C.19 Mk. V and saw production on the Cierva C.30 series of 1934. In March 1934 this type of autogyro became the first rotorcraft to take off and land on the deck of a ship, when a C.30 performed trials on board the Spanish navy seaplane tender DÃ©dalo off Valencia.|$|E
2500|$|More recently, large-rotor {{disc brakes}} {{are being used}} as drag brakes. [...] DT-Swiss make an adapter to mate disc <b>rotors</b> with <b>hubs</b> {{threaded}} for the Arai drum brake, but this still leaves the problem of fitting the caliper.|$|R
50|$|The <b>rotor</b> system (<b>hub</b> and blades) is {{very similar}} to that found on the early {{versions}} of the Hughes 269 / Schweizer 300 series helicopters. The primary difference is in the twist of the blades (or lack thereof), optimized for autorotation {{in the case of the}} J-2.|$|R
50|$|In 1975 NASA {{designed}} and built its first prototype wind turbine, the 100 kW Mod-0 in Sandusky Ohio, with funding from the National Science Foundation and ERDA. The Mod-0 was modeled after the light weight two-bladed research turbine by Austrian Ulrich HÃ¼tter. The two-bladed wind turbine with flexible or teetered <b>rotor</b> <b>hubs</b> characterized the NASA-led program. NASA and its contractors found that two blades can produce essentially equivalent energy as three blades but at a savings of the cost and weight of a blade. Two-blade rotors turn faster than equivalent three-blade rotors, reducing the ratio in the gearbox. Flexibility in the rotor minimizes the transfer of bending loads into the drive train; none of the NASA wind turbines experienced gearbox failures that are often a problem for rigid rotor systems in use today.|$|R
25|$|Materials {{for wind}} turbine parts {{other than the}} rotor blades (including the <b>rotor</b> <b>hub,</b> gearbox, frame, and tower) are largely {{composed}} of steel. Modern turbines uses a couple of tonnes of copper for generators, cables and such. Smaller wind turbines have begun incorporating more aluminum based alloys into these components {{in an effort to}} make the turbines more lightweight and efficient, and may continue to be used increasingly if fatigue and strength properties can be improved. Prestressed concrete has been increasingly used for the material of the tower, but still, requires much reinforcing steel to meet the strength requirement of the turbine. Additionally, step-up gearboxes are being increasingly replaced with variable speed generators, increasing the demand for magnetic materials in wind turbines., In particular, this would require an increased supply of the rare earth metal neodymium. Reliance on rare earth minerals for components has risked expense and price volatility as China has been main producer of rare earth minerals (96% in 2009) and had been reducing its export quotas of these materials. In recent years, however, other producers have increased production of rare earth minerals and China has removed its reduced export quota on rare earths leading to an increased supply and decreased cost of rare earth minerals, increasing the viability of the implementation of variable speed generators in wind turbines on a large scale.|$|E

500|$|The V-22 has triple-redundant {{fly-by-wire}} {{flight control}} systems, which included computerized damage control to automatically isolate damaged areas. With the nacelles pointing {{straight up in}} conversion mode at 90Â° the flight computers command the aircraft to fly like a helicopter, with cyclic forces being applied to a conventional swashplate at the <b>rotor</b> <b>hub.</b> With the nacelles in airplane mode (0Â°) the flaperons, rudder, and elevator fly similar to an airplane. This is a gradual transition, occurring over the nacelles' rotation range; the lower the nacelles, the greater effect of the airplane-mode control surfaces. The nacelles can rotate past vertical to 97.5Â° for rearward flight. The V-22 can use the [...] "80 Jump" [...] orientation with the nacelles at 80Â° for takeoff to quickly achieve high altitude and speed. The control systems automate and simplify {{to the extent that}} the V-22 can hover in low wind with no hands on the controls. According to some who have flown the aircraft, former fixed-wing pilots may be preferable over helicopter ones as they are not trained to constantly adjust the controls while hovering.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{helicopter}} rotor blade planform sweep on <b>rotor</b> vibratory <b>hub,</b> blade, and control system loads has been analytically investigated.

40|$|In recent years, {{the process}} of {{diffusion}} bonding has found considerable usage in both the nuclear power and aerospace industries. This process requires the compression of mating surfaces at an elevated temperature for a given time. If optimum conditions of time, temperature, pressure and surface cleanliness are achieved, diffusion of material across the interface will occur, yielding interfacial mechanical properties identical {{to those of the}} bulk material. The use of insufficient bonding conditions may result in void formation, precipitation of undesired phases or lack of grain growth across the interface. The consequence will be an interface that is less than fully bonded, which will result in severe degradation of the mechanical properties. Applications of diffusion bonding to nuclear reactor fuel elements, helicopter <b>rotor</b> <b>hubs,</b> jet engine turbine blades, etc., thus make the ability to characterize the strength of these interfaces highly desirable...|$|R

40|$|The use {{of active}} blade pitch control to {{increase}} helicopter rotor/body damping is studied. Control is introduced through a conventional nonrotating swashplate. State variable feedback of rotor and body states is used. Feedback parameters include cyclic rotor flap and lead-lag states, and body {{pitch and roll}} rotations. The use of position, rate, and acceleration feedback is studied for the various state variables. In particular, {{the influence of the}} closed loop feedback gain and phase on system stability is investigated. For the rotor/body configuration analyzed, rotor cyclic inplane motion and body roll-rate and roll-acceleration feedback can considerably augment system damping levels and eliminate ground resonance instabilities. Scheduling of the feedback state, phase, and gain with rotor rotation speed can be used to maximize the damping augmentation. This increase in lead-lag damping can be accomplished without altering any of the system modal frequencies. Investigating various rotor design parameters (effective hinge offset, blade precone, blade flap stiffness) indicates that active control for augmenting rotor/body damping will be particularly powerful for hingeless and bearingless <b>rotor</b> <b>hubs...</b>|$|R
