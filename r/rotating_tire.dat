50|$|Camber thrust and camber force are terms used to {{describe}} the force generated perpendicular to the direction of travel of a rolling tire due to its camber angle and finite contact patch. Camber thrust is generated when a point on the outer surface of a leaned and <b>rotating</b> <b>tire,</b> that would normally follow a path that is elliptical when projected onto the ground, is forced to follow a straight path while coming in contact with the ground, due to friction. This deviation towards the direction of the lean causes a deformation in the tire tread and carcass that is transmitted to the vehicle as a force {{in the direction of the}} lean.|$|E

50|$|In some systems the {{passenger}} cabins, which can hold {{between two and}} 8 people, {{are connected to the}} cable by means of spring-loaded grips. These grips allow the cabin to be detached from the moving cable and slowed down in the terminals, to allow passengers to board and disembark. Doors are almost always automatic and controlled by a lever on the roof or on the undercarriage that is pushed up or down. Cabins are driven through the terminals either by <b>rotating</b> <b>tires,</b> or by a chain system. To be accelerated to and decelerated from line speed, cabins are driven along by progressively swifter (or slower) <b>rotating</b> <b>tires</b> until they reach line or terminal speed. On older installations, gondolas are accelerated manually by an operator. Gondola lifts can have intermediate stops that allow for uploading and downloading on the lift. Examples of a lift with three stops instead of the standard two are the Village Gondola and the Excalibur Gondolas at Whistler Blackcomb.|$|R
50|$|A funitel {{consists}} {{of one or}} two loops of cable strung between two terminals over intermediate towers. In order to maximize the stability of the passenger cabins, the cables are arranged in two pairs moving in separate directions. Although it might appear that there are four cables in total, {{most of the time they}} are all connected as a single, long loop.The passenger cabins are connected to a pair of cables with four spring-loaded grips (two to each cable). Because the cable runs at a speed faster than that at which most people would care to board or disembark, the cabins must be slowed down while in the terminals to allow skiers to get on and off. This is accomplished by detaching the cabin from the cable and slowing it down with progressively slower <b>rotating</b> <b>tires</b> mounted on the ceiling of the terminal. Once the cabin has reached a speed at which it is safe to load or unload passengers, the cabin is moved about the end turnaround by tires mounted on the floor. The cabin is then accelerated to line speed with a second set of <b>rotating</b> <b>tires.</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, a new {{two-dimensional}} hybrid quarter-car {{model has been}} developed. The hybrid model {{takes into account the}} inertia of the discrete vehicle body mounted on suspension and the dynamics of the <b>rotating</b> <b>tire</b> modeled as a continuous ring. The contact force between the tire and road is defined {{as a function of the}} bounce vibration of the vehicle as well as a function of the radial and tangential displacements and accelerations of the tire. The effects of the vibrating system on the contact force are investigated. Three different types of solution are presented: the Galerkin method, the finite element method, and the exact analytical method. Different solutions are used to validate the accuracy of the results. The mode shapes of the center-fixed rotating ring are used as admissible functions in the Galerkin method. In the finite element method, a curved beam is used as the element. The equations are derived in a non-rotating coordinate system. In other words, the nodes do not rotate. However, the material of the ring does rotate by flowing through the non-rotating nodes. The analytical study presents the closed-form solutions of the horizontal displacement and of the vertical displacement of the center of the tire (unsprung mass) as well as the displacement of the vehicle body (sprung mass). This method also provides the radial displacement and the tangential displacement of the rotating ring in the non-rotating coordinate system, all the displacements of the ring being measured with respect to the center of the ring. The results obtained by the different methods are compared and discussed. The natural frequencies of this hybrid system are compared with those obtained for a center-fixed ring. Also the damped frequencies of the system are obtained for different velocities of the vehicle. The mode shapes of the hybrid model are complex because of the <b>rotating</b> <b>tire.</b> Moreover, the response of the hybrid model to the random excitation caused by the road is studied.

The setup is used to analyse mechanisms of tire/road noise during road impact excitations, such as a cobbled roads, joints of a concrete road surface, railroad crossings,… The noise that is radiated from a tire strongly determines the passenger acoustic comfort and the traffic noise. Besides the radiated noise, the spindle forces induce vibrations that generate noise in the passenger compartment. Typical for a road impact excitation are a short duration tactile spike (shock) and a short duration noise spike (impact boom) experienced by a passenger. A series of test are performed with different driving speeds, cleat dimensions and inflation pressures. The test results are used to identify and quantify the mechanisms of noise generation during impact excitations with respect to the different parameters. These analyses will contribute to the future development of tire models to simulate the acoustic and structural response to road impact excitations. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} studies have been {{previously}} concerned with vibrations of rotating tires. In order to capture detailed dynamics of a <b>rotating</b> <b>tire,</b> complex numerical models have been developed accounting for the non-homogeneous structural properties of the tire belt and sidewall, structural-acoustic coupling and complex geometry description (including that of the wheel rim), under varying rotation speeds. Although a remarkable amount of details can be successfully modelled using such an approach, it can be rather difficult to parameterize the model, i. e. to establish a clear-cut relationship between a geometrical or material property of a tire and the corresponding change in the tire dynamics. Thus an alternative approach is employed within the scope of this study by modelling simplified tire geometries. The focus of the study is put onto modelling vibrations of the tire belt, which could be approximated by a pressurised thin cylindrical shell having free boundaries. Then the mode shapes and resonance frequencies of the belt are calculated as functions of the material and geometrical properties of the shell and the speed of the shell rotation. The resonance frequencies and the mode shapes of the free rotating cylindrical shell could be used to form a foundation for the forced vibration response and thus offer a possibility to couple the free tire belt to models of the sidewall and the air cavity inside the tire using, for example, mobility-impedance based methods. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{simplified}} {{model of a}} <b>rotating</b> <b>tire</b> is developed and free vibrations of the tire are analysed on an example case. The tire belt is modelled as a rotating cylindrical shell. The shell ends {{are assumed to be}} with free boundary conditions. A flexible foundation is considered under the belt surface in order {{to take into account the}} stiffness of the air inside the tire as well as the tire sidewall. Moreover, the tire inflation pressure is accounted for. This is necessary since it generates an important tangential pre-stress in the tire belt. Finally, the effects of rotation onto the resonance frequencies and the mode shapes of the tire are considered. This is done by introducing Coriolis and centrifugal terms into the equations of motion plus the tangential centrifugal pre-stress. The boundary conditions of the elastically supported shell are satisfied exactly and the corresponding mode shapes and the resonance frequencies are calculated for an example case. Unlike the shells with simply supported ends, the shells with free ends have the functional form of the mode shapes changing with frequency. In particular, the dependence of a mode shape on the axial coordinate exhibits strong generic variation with frequency. Consequently, different combinations of transcendental functions (hyperbolic and circular) occur at different frequency ranges. The Coriolis accelerations and the centrifugal tension are shown to play an important role in how the resonance frequencies of the tire veer with rotation speed. In fact, the modes rotating backward and forward along the tire circumference tend to slow down or speed up with the increase in rotation speed. Thus they no longer superimpose into standing waves. In contrast, they keep propagating as travelling modes. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|It is {{now known}} that tire/road {{interaction}} noise is the major contributor to exterior automobile noise and establishes the background noise level in many environments. Thus, the reduction of tire/road noise is a major environmental noise issue today. ^ Among the numerous tire noise mechanisms, tire vibration has been established as the primary source: i. e., a tire 2 ̆ 7 s tread block hits the road surface, and then the underlying reinforcing belts vibrate owing to the force transmitted through the tread block, resulting in sound radiation from the vibrating tire surface. ^ In an attempt to identify the dominant tire noise sources, a sound field visualization procedure referred to as Nearfield Acoustical Holography was applied to a rolling tire: {{it has been shown}} that sound radiation originates close to the contact patch of a tire. ^ An experimental procedure has also been introduced to identify the main characteristics of tire vibration. In the latter procedure, a tire is driven radially at a point on its treadband and measurements of the resulting radial treadband vibration are made around the treadband circumference by using a laser Doppler velocimeter. By performing a circumferential wave number transform of the measured data, the dispersion relations can be obtained that quantify the multi-modal wave propagation characteristics of a tire, specifically the wave propagation speeds and attenuation rates. ^ For the purpose of identifying tire design parameters that can control tire vibration components that are responsible for sound radiation, various tire models have been developed. In particular, for the purpose of modeling a tire at low computational expense, a hybrid two-dimensional finite element model was developed in which the cross-section of a tire is approximated by two-dimensional finite elements while an analytical wave-like solution is assumed in the circumferential direction of the tire. ^ Finally, the vibration of an inflated, circular cylindrical shell, rotating about a fixed axis has been considered in an attempt to understand the effects of rotation on wave propagation within a tire 2 ̆ 7 s treadband. It is suggested that a stationary tire analysis may be used to predict the characteristics of a <b>rotating</b> <b>tire</b> after performing a simple kinematic compensation. ...|$|E

Here, we demonstrate a simple, low cost and effective approach of using the charging process in friction to convert mechanical energy into electric power for driving small electronics. The triboelectric generator (TEG) is fabricated by stacking two polymer sheets made of materials having distinctly different triboelectric characteristics, with metal films deposited {{on the top and}} bottom of the assembled structure. Once subjected to mechanical deformation, a friction between the two films, owing to the nano-scale surface roughness, generates equal amount but opposite signs of charges at two sides. Thus, a triboelectric potential layer is formed at the interface region, which serves as a charge 'pump' for driving the flow of electrons in the external load if there is a variation in the capacitance of the system.
