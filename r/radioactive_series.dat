40|$|One of {{approaches}} under {{the development of}} radioactive waste treatment conception {{is based on the}} principle of natural and artificial <b>radioactive</b> <b>series</b> radioactivity equivalency. The basic natural radioactive elements are included into four <b>radioactive</b> <b>series</b> (Tab. l). These are: thorium series, neptunium series, uranium series and uranium-actinium series. All of <b>radioactive</b> <b>series</b> articles are bond by irreversible reciprocal transformations. Therefore closed systems reach the equilibrium during the definite period. Natural series contains the radioactive elements accumulated during millions of years. Great quantities of the radioactive daughter isotopes are in equilibrium with uranium and thorium (Tab. l). The series elements are take out thanks to geochemical processes, difference of physical and chemical properties and miming [1]. Thus the system may be opened. It causes the breach of radioactive equilibrium. Therefore it is necessary to know the system open state degree and time to estimate the series radioactivity. The reactor actinides are predecessors for defined <b>radioactive</b> <b>series.</b> The actinide production depends on correlation between fission and capture cross-section and neutron spectrum.

40|$|AbstractLead 210 Pb, {{an element}} of the natural uranium {{radioactive}} decay series, is not currently considered a source of radiation risk, especially in a radiation protection system in underground mines in Poland.

Routine measurements showed significantly higher than expected concentrations of 210 Pb in underground radium rich sediments, based only on the radioactive decay law. This phenomenon implies a need of 210 Pb concentration monitoring in such sediments. Nevertheless, the laboratory analysis of 210 Pb by gamma radiation spectroscopy is connected with a particular hindrance, the self-attenuation of 210 Pb radiation in samples. Current work describes a practical method for obtaining the self-attenuation correction factor in the case of 210 Pb concentration analysis.

40|$|The {{determination}} of coral skeletal growth, from both a biological and a geological standpoint, has long presented difficulties in ease {{and accuracy of}} measurement. As a consequence, factors which limit growth {{are only beginning to}} be investigated. Radiometric methods using natural <b>radioactive</b> <b>series</b> nuclides have recently been used to determine the growth rate of certain corals. In addition, X radiographs coupled with 90 Sr-induced autoradiographs have demonstrated that at least some hermatypic corals record annual growth bands in their skeletons. Once annual banding is confirmed, measurement of band widths allows precise {{determination of}} yearly growth increments. It is thus possible to compare inter- and intraspecific coral growth rates from different areas with pertinent environmental variables and to educe possible correlations. We describe here an investigation of the effects of resuspension of bottom sediments on the growth rate, as determined by a 228 Ra technique and X radiography of Montastrea annularis in different parts of Discovery Bay, Jamaica.

40|$|The {{study of}} the {{environmental}} impact of natural and anthropogenic events forms the essence of environmental pollution considerations. The nature of the polluting species as well as their time distributions are of primary importance with respect to identifying the polluting sources. Sediments are the most frequently used materials in such studies. Sediments act as the ecological memories of the environments of their formation. Besides classical chronological methods, radiochronological methods developed recently gave a big impetus to environmental pollution studies. One of the key radioisotopic technique is to utilize 210 Pb, a product of the 235 U <b>radioactive</b> <b>series</b> to date the last 200 years of the sediments. A number of supporting indicators are also utilized. One of them being anthropogenic 137 Cs which is used as a time-marker. Large amounts of 137 Cs radioactivity was released to the environment during 1954 - 1963, in time of the most intense atmospheric nuclear arms testing and again in 1986 during the Chernobyl nuclear accident. These intense 137 s activities form time-markers throughout sediment cores corresponding to their release years. During our studies extending over several years we have used radiochronological methods in dating several sediment cores from Zurich and Constance Lakes in Switzerland from east coast of Spain, Sea of Marmara, from the Black Sea region, Southern coast of Turkey and from North Cyprus. The distribution of several elemental concentrations of importance in pollution considerations along sediment cores were also determined.

40|$|Coal- and lignite-fired {{power plants}} produce {{significant}} amounts of ashes, which are quite often being used as additives in cement and other building materials. In many cases, coal and lignite present high concentrations of naturally occurring radionuclides, such as U- 238, Ra- 226, Pb- 210, Th- 232 and K- 40. During the combustion process, the produced ashes are enriched in the above radionuclides. The different enrichment of the various radionuclides within a <b>radioactive</b> <b>series,</b> {{such as that of}} 238 U, results in the disturbance of radioactive secular equilibrium. An extensive research project for the determination of the natural radioactivity of lignite and ashes from Greek lignite-fired power plants is in progress in the Nuclear Engineering Department of the National Technical University of Athens (NED-NTUA) since 1983. This paper presents detailed results for the natural radioactivity, the secular radioactive equilibrium disturbance and the radon exhalation rate of the fly-ash collected at the different stages along the emission control system of a lignite-fired power plant {{as well as of the}} bottom-ash. From the results obtained so far, it may be concluded that Ra- 226 radioactivity of fly-ash in some cases exceeds 1 kBq kg(- 1), which is much higher than the mean Ra- 226 radioactivity of surface soils in Greece (25 Bq kg(- 1)). Furthermore, the radioactivity of Pb- 210 in fly-ash may reach 4 kBq kg(- 1). These results are interpreted in relation to the physical properties of the investigated nuclides, the temperature in the flue-gas pathway, as well as the fly-ash grain size distribution. It is concluded that towards the coldest parts of the emission control system of the power plant, the radioactivity of some natural nuclides is gradually enhanced, secular radioactive equilibrium is significantly disturbed and the radon exhalation rate tends to increase.

40|$|In {{this work}} we present {{progress}} obtained in analysis {{airborne geophysical survey}} data for the north-central region {{of the state of}} Goias (Brazil). The results obtained indicate that most of the subtropical soil types are characterized by Uranium contents of greater than one parts per million (ppm). Only ultisol and oxisol soils are found to have Uranium contents lower than one ppm. Thorium and Potassium abundances also display trends similar to those of Uranium. The K/U ratios fall in the expected range of values for common soils while the Th/U ratios are higher than normal. This latter observation may indicate a characteristic feature of subtropical soils. Alternatively it may be considered as indicative of disequilibrium conditions in <b>radioactive</b> <b>series</b> and consequent underestimation of Uranium in soil layers of the study area. In this context we point out the possibility of using results of radiometric surveys as a convenient complementary tool in identifying geochemical zoning of soils in subtropical environments. Analysis of aeromagnetic data reveals the presence {{of a large number of}} magnetic lineaments. The analytic signal values point to the existence of substantial small scale variations related to lithologic changes. There are indications that deposition of soil types are controlled to a large extent by the system of NE-SW trending faults and fracture systems. According to results of radiogenic heat production calculations the cambisol soil in this region are found to have a mean heat production of 3. 32 ± 5. 9 μ Wm- 3 while that of ultisol soil is only 0. 36 ± 0. 3 μ Wm- 3.

The prescriptions of these models and/or the physical meaning of the parameters used by them have been subjected to criticism. In this letter we present a model independent description of the accumulated data pointing out the most important variables which scale the cluster decay probabilities.

The cyclopentadienylrhenium tricarbonyl moiety is indeed stable in biological media, compact, lipophilic and easy to handle. Furthermore, this study allowed us to select the best candidates for subsequent use as radiopharmaceuticals either for imaging or therapy by using appropriate radionucleides, namely Tc- 99 m and Re- 188. In these molecules the beta-phenyl group of OH-Tam has been replaced by the (eta(5) -C 5 H 4) Re(CO) (3) moiety, and the length of the dimethylamino side chain -O(CH 2) (n) N(CH 3) (2) was varied (n = 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8). The compounds 7 a- 7 e were obtained as mixtures of their Z and E isomers, which could be separated by semipreparative HPLC Unlike their ferrocene homologues, the compounds do not isomerise in solution. Structural identification was carried out with NMR spectroscopy by using the HMBC and NOE techniques and was confirmed by the X-ray structural determination of (E) - 7 a (n= 2). These molecules were more lipophilic than OH-Tam (logP(o/w) = 4. 5 - 6. 3) and they were all reasonably well recognized by the two forms of the estrogen receptor (ERalpha and ERbeta). For example,(Z) - 7 b (n = 3) has high relative binding affinity (RBA) values of 31 % for ERalpha and 16. 8 % for ERbeta.

These molecules had an antiproliferative effect on MCF 7 cells slightly higher than that of OH-Tam and no effect on MDA-MB 231 cells.

40|$|A 2 m-thick {{spheroidal}} weathering profile, {{developed on}} a quartz diorite in the Rio Icacos watershed (Luquillo Mountains, eastern Puerto Rico), was analyzed for major and trace element concentrations, Sr and Nd isotopic ratios and U-series nuclides (238 U– 234 U– 230 Th– 226 Ra). In this profile a 40 cm thick soil horizon is overlying a 150 cm thick saprolite which {{is separated from}} the basal corestone by a ∼ 40 cm thick rindlet zone. The Sr and Nd isotopic variations along the whole profile imply that, in addition to geochemical fractionations associated to water–rock interactions, the geochemical budget of the profile is influenced by a significant accretion of atmospheric dusts. The mineralogical and geochemical variations along the profile also confirm that the weathering front does not progress continuously from the top {{to the base of}} the profile. The upper part of the profile is probably associated with a different weathering system (lateral weathering of upper corestones) than the lower part, which consists of the basal corestone, the associated rindlet system and the saprolite in contact with these rindlets. Consequently, the determination of weathering rates from 238 U– 234 U– 230 Th– 226 Ra disequilibrium in a series of samples collected along a vertical depth profile can only be attempted for samples collected in the lower part of the profile, i. e. the rindlet zone and the lower saprolite. Similar propagation rates were derived for the rindlet system and the saprolite by using classical models involving loss and gain processes for all nuclides to interpret the variation of U-series nuclides in the rindlet-saprolite subsystem. The consistency of these weathering rates with average weathering and erosion rates derived via other methods for the whole watershed provides a new and independent argument that, in the Rio Icacos watershed, the weathering system has reached a geomorphologic steady-state. Our study also indicates that even in environments with differential weathering, such as observed for the Puerto Rico site, the radioactive disequilibrium between the nuclides of a single <b>radioactive</b> <b>series</b> (here 238 U– 234 U– 230 Th– 226 Ra) can still be interpreted in terms of a simplified scenario of congruent weathering. Incidentally, the U–Th–Ra disequilibrium in the corestone samples confirms that the outermost part of the corestone is already weathered...|$|E
40|$|Models for {{radioactive}} disintegration Between 1911 and 1928 {{only a few}} authors made {{a contribution}} to models for radioactive disintegration. Most authors thought of radioactive disintegration {{as a consequence of}} the mutual repulsive or attractive forces between the particles inside a decaying atom, whenever these particles reached an instable configuration. In the other cases use was made of the cumulative effect of small irregularities in the paths of the particles in the nucleus, or of an analogy of lightning to make the process of radioactive disintegration intelligible. None of the models for radioactive disintegration attracted much attention. The most influential model was the one proposed by F. A. Lindemann in 1914. Lindemann's model was based on an empirical relationship between the range of aparticles and the lifetime of a decaying atom, which was found by H. Geiger and J. M. Nutall in 1911, Like the Geiger-Nutall-relation. this model was confined to substances emitting n-rays. Lindemann's model and the treatises based on it were more quantitative in character than the other models. Lindemann assumed that the nucleus of a radioactive element became instable when,V independent particles passed through some unknown critical position within a short time r. He further assumed that the particles in the nucleus rotated or oscillated with the mean energy E—hv, the energy of the a-particle emitted. Using the Geiger-Nutall-relation and a few additional assumptions Lindemann found N to be equal to 80. This seemed to show, that nearly all the positive particles inside the nucleus had to conspire to bring about the disintegration of the atom. An interesting development could be seen in the use that was made of the Geiger-Nutallrelation by the authors who contributed to Lindemann's model. Lindemann just used the overall relationship. Meyer and W'olff stressed the differences between the three <b>radioactive</b> <b>series.</b> In Kirsch' treatises, however, the Geiger-Nutall-relation had partly lost its empirical content. The two most detailed models for the process of radioactive disintegration were proposed bij Wolff and Kirsch. Though both models were based on Lindemann's model, the differences were notable. Wolff assumed that in all isotopes within one series a similar change took place inside the nucleus, immediately before the disintegration. When an atom disintegrated, the outmost a-particle was emitted. In Kirsch' model the disintegration of an atom came about in a similar manner only for a part of the series. In this model it was always the innermost a-particle that was emitted...|$|E

40|$|Biohazards are non-conventional {{threats that}} are very {{difficult}} to manage. This is due to difficulties in the identification of biological agents that are responsible for the onset of a disease, which can be bacteria, viruses, fungus or toxins. In Italy, the first response system to biohazards is provided by the National Fire Brigade (NFB) (Corpo Nazionale dei Vigili del Fuoco - CNVVF). The aim of this work is to evaluate the procedures adopted by the NFB for the management of biohazards. This is done by comparing the statistics of NFB interventions in 2000 - 2010 for potential biohazard events, and chemical and <b>radioactive</b> risks. A <b>series</b> of solutions is then proposed to improve the NFB’s national response system for biohazards...|$|R
