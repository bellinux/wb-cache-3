40|$|Whether {{federalism}} is {{more than}} a legal fiction is a question that generates considerable controversy among scholars in law and the social sciences. Historians of 19 th-century American federalism have differed about the workings of the federal system in the era characterized as 2 ̆ 2 dual federalism. 2 ̆ 2 This article provides an analysis of these controversies and offers a theoretical position on the problem of real power under federalism. The historical literature, it is argued, provides legal scholars and social scientists with abundant data on the <b>reach,</b> <b>diversity,</b> and effects of governmental action in the different historical epochs of American federalism. The relationship of federalism in the United States to political freedom, governmental performance and efficiency, and the formation of public policy all receive attention...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Adolescents {{and young}} adults (AYA) exposed to family {{violence}} {{are in need of}} professional healthcare. However, only one-third of them seek professional help. METHODS: This study investigates healthcare needs of twelve AYA exposed to family violence. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews using purposive sampling to <b>reach</b> <b>diversity.</b> Open thematic coding was used to identify the most important themes. RESULTS: Participants experienced emotional problems, distrusted others and felt unsafe as an important consequence of their exposure to family violence. All participants expressed a need for help, but as help involved informing others, they considered it unsafe. Trust, safety and control regarding healthcare interventions emerged as vital needs. The anonymity of the Internet was considered as offering safeguards in seeking and receiving help. CONCLUSION: Trust, safety and control regarding healthcare interventions emerged as vital needs for AYA exposed to family violence. The great importance of being in control of healthcare interventions has not been reported earlier. A personal bond can lower the need for control. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: To comply with the three basic needs, healthcare providers should grant AYA as much control as possible while still monitoring patient safety. The Internet can be an important resource for offering low-threshold professional and peer support...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This report {{looks into}} the {{relation}} between city planning and city life, in the Copenhagen neighborhood of Ørestad City. We look at the limitations and possibilities created by the city planning in Ørestad City. Since the physical layout of the city spaces, is {{a direct consequence of}} the planning process, the report will look at what type of city life, is created on the basis of physical layout of the public space, in Ørestad City. Next it is investigated, which consequences the existing city life, has for the citizens. We conclude that the way Ørestad City was planned has meant a number of things for the city life in Ørestad City. First of all, the focus throughout the planning process, was elsewhere than at the people who were going to live in the town. This lack of focus means that the city has been planned for the collective, instead of being planned for individuality and diversity. By planning this way, Ørestad city has become a town divided into different functions. This way of dividing the town, means that city life in Ørestad city will struggle to <b>reach</b> <b>diversity.</b> If a city life lacks diversity, the repercussions for the citizens within, could be a lack of ability to be tolerant and understanding members of society...|$|E

40|$|An {{extremely}} strong H/D isotope effect {{observed in}} hydrogen bonded A-H…B systems {{is connected with}} a <b>reach</b> <b>diversity</b> of the potential shape for the proton/deuteron motion. It is connected with the anharmonicity of the proton/deuteron vibrations and of the tunneling effect, particularly in cases of short bridges with low barrier for protonic and deuteronic jumping. Six extreme shapes of the proton motion are presented starting from the state without possibility of the proton transfer up to the state with a full ionization. The manifestations of the H/D isotope effect are best reflected in the infra-red absorption spectra. A most characteristic is {{the run of the}} relationship between the isotopic ratio nH/nD and position of the absorption band shown by using the example of NHN hydrogen bonds. One can distinguish a critical range of correlation when the isotopic ratio reaches the value of ca. 1 and then increases up to unusual values higher than. The critical range of the isotope effect is also visible in NQR and NMR spectra. In the critical region one observes a stepwise change of the NQR frequency reaching 1. 1 MHz. In the case of NMR, the maximal isotope effect is reflected on the curve presenting the dependence of Δd (1 H, 2 H) on d (1 H). This effect corresponds to the range of maximum on the correlation curve between dH and ΔpKa that is observed in various systems. There is a lack in the literature of quantitative information about the influence of isotopic substitution on the dielectric properties of hydrogen bond except the isotope effect on the ferroelectric phase transition in some hydrogen bonded crystals...|$|E
40|$|Urbanization causes myriad {{changes in}} {{watershed}} processes, ultimately disrupting {{the structure and}} function of stream ecosystems. Urban development introduces contaminants (human waste, pesticides, industrial chemicals). Impervious surfaces and artificial drainage systems speed the delivery of contaminants to streams, while bypassing soil filtration and local riparian processes that can mitigate the impacts of these contaminants, and disrupting the timing and volume of hydrologic patterns. Aquatic habitats where biota live are degraded by sedimentation, channel incision, floodplain disconnection, substrate alteration and elimination of <b>reach</b> <b>diversity.</b> These compounding changes ultimately lead to alteration of invertebrate community structure and function. Because the effects of urbanization on stream ecosystems are complex, multilayered, and interacting, modeling these effects presents many unique challenges, including: addressing and quantifying processes at multiple scales, representing major interrelated simultaneously acting dynamics at the system level, incorporating uncertainty resulting from imperfect knowledge, imperfect data, and environmental variability, and integrating multiple sources of available information about the system into the modeling construct. These challenges can be addressed by using a Bayesian modeling approach. Specifically, the use of multilevel hierarchical models and Bayesian network models allows the modeler to harness the hierarchical nature of the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) Effect of Urbanization on Stream Ecosystems (EUSE) dataset to predict invertebrate response at both basin and regional levels, concisely represent and parameterize this system of complicated cause and effect relationships and uncertainties, calculate the full probabilistic function of all variables efficiently {{as the product of}} more manageable conditional probabilities, and includes both expert knowledge and data. Utilizing this Bayesian framework, this dissertation develops a series of statistically rigorous and ecologically interpretable models predicting the effect of urbanization on invertebrates, as well as a unique, systematic methodology that creates an informed expert prior and then updates this prior with available data using conjugate Dirichlet-multinomial distribution forms. The resulting models elucidate differences between regional responses to urbanization (particularly due to background agriculture and precipitation) and address the influences of multiple urban induced stressors acting simultaneously from a new system-level perspective. These Bayesian modeling approaches quantify previously unexplained regional differences in biotic response to urbanization, capture multiple interacting environmental and ecological processes affected by urbanization, and ultimately link urbanization effects on stream biota to a management context such that these models describe and quantify how changes in drivers lead to changes in regulatory endpoint (the Biological Condition Gradient; BCG).

40|$|Succession {{was already}} studied over decades. The present thesis {{investigated}} the succession on hard substrate at two different study sites within the fjord Comau, Chile. Nine plates were installed at both sites (mouth of fjord and inner fjord) and photographed over three years. Additionally the natural community was recorded and a ground truthing {{was carried out}} to verify the analyzed species. Respectively at both sites over 50 different species were detected. Abundance data decreased with only one exception continuously, whereas the percentage cover increased. But the communities on the recruitment plates still did not reach the community structure of the natural environment. The present data indicates that for the hard bottom community in the fjord Comau is best described by the TOLERANCE MODEL (Connell & Slatyer, 1977). An important species of the natural community is the stony coral Desmophyllum dianthus, which normally (outside the fjord) grows beneath 1000 m water depth.

40|$|Abstract The {{formations}} of the Balaton Highland {{provide a}} high-resolution record of various fossil groups (ammonoids, bivalves, brachiopods) from the Early Triassic to the Carnian, with remarkable changes in taxonomic diversity. The local data differ considerably from the gradually increasing global diversity trends {{of the respective}} fossil groups. Ammonoids are rare in the Early Triassic; during the Anisian they <b>reach</b> a <b>diversity</b> maximum and remain rather diverse until the Carnian. This {{is connected to the}} considerable deepening of the sedimentary basin in the Middle Triassic. The benthic fossil groups show almost inverse local trends. In the Early Triassic, the proliferation of bivalves largely follows the transgressive pulses in the shallow marine setting; brachiopods are represented solely by Lingula specimens. Both the bivalve and the brachiopod diversity culminate in the middle Anisian what is interpreted in terms of extensional tectonic movements: the rocky escarpments of the disintegrated carbonate platforms provided favorable biotopes for sessile benthic organisms. The benthic diversities decreased significantly in the rest of Middle Triassic, which is due to the significant deepening of the local basin floor. The benthic groups <b>reached</b> maximum <b>diversity</b> in the Carnian. This is attributed partly to the filling up and shallowing of the local basin, partly to redeposition in the course of platform progradations, carrying rich fossil shell material from the neighboring shallow marine environments to the basin. Simultaneously, the sudden increase of the humidity (“Carnian pluvial event”) created extensive river systems in the European continent; the increasing supply of organic matter was favorable for the benthos in the marine environments...|$|R
