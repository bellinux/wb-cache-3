Order picking {{is the process}} by which products are <b>retrieved</b> <b>from</b> <b>storage</b> <b>to</b> meet customer demand. Various new routing methods are introduced to determine efficient sequences in which products have <b>to</b> be <b>retrieved</b> <b>from</b> <b>storage.</b> Furthermore, a new method is given to determine a layout for the order picking area. The objective is to minimize the average distance traveled per route by the order pickers...|$|R

Renewable energy resources, especially solar/wind energy, are now penetrating this sector. Long-term energy storage is the universal challenge in providing renewables-based electricity with high availability across the seasons. Here we review and discuss the use of hydrogen as the energy vector by means of which solar/wind energy is transformed, stored and made available as electricity. The dominant system configuration is presently photovoltaic electricity used to electrolyse water to produce hydrogen, which is stored as a pressurised gas or metal-hydride, then <b>retrieved</b> <b>from</b> <b>storage</b> <b>to</b> generate electricity in a fuel cell. We survey the demonstration projects {{reported in the literature}} and discuss the need for authoritative system modelling in order to size the system components for minimum cost at a designated availability of supply.

The {{aim of the}} degree project at Franke Futurum is to streamline the flow of materials and procedures when assembling their top-selling range kitchen fan series, as well as improvements in the working environment. A production experienced not being optimal efficient. The {{work has been done}} by evolutionary development of existing production. The project begins with the clarification of project goals and the establishment of a project plan {{as the basis for the}} work. Project structure and the methodology used follows the theory that has developed or incorporated into LEAN organization theory. After project planning began context survey by means of data collection over the current situation. It showed that there were a number of long and numerous short but frequent transport of materials that took time from actual production. Based on contextual survey a requirement specification was created with requisites for solution proposal to improve the layout and working practices to improve production efficiency. The requirement specification is then used in the work of idea and concept development phases and as a base to develop solutions and evaluate them. The work resulted in layout proposal drawing with some reorganization of the production area.

40|$|Order picking {{consists}} in <b>retrieving</b> products <b>from</b> <b>storage</b> locations <b>to</b> satisfy independent orders from multiple customers. It is generally {{recognized as one}} of the most signiﬁcant activities in a warehouse (Koster et al, 2007). In fact, order picking accounts up to 50 % (Frazelle, 2001) or even 80 % (Van den Berg, 1999) of the total warehouse operating costs. The critical issue in today’s business environment is to simultaneously reduce the cost and increase the speed of order picking. In this paper, we address the order picking process in one of the Portuguese largest companies in the grocery business. This problem was proposed at the 92 nd European Study Group with Industry (ESGI 92). In this setting, each operator steers a trolley on the shop ﬂoor in order to select items for multiple customers. The objective is to improve their grocery e-commerce and bring it up to the level of the best international practices. In particular, the company wants to improve the routing tasks in order to decrease distances. For this purpose, a mathematical model for a faster open shop picking was developed. In this paper, we describe the problem, our proposed solution as well as some preliminary results and conclusions...|$|R
40|$|Dear friends, The {{aftermath}} {{of one of}} the most devastating post earthquake- tsunamis in the history of mankind, the March 2011 post-earthquake-tsunami-hitnuclear accident in Fukushima, Japan, has brought to fore several questions throughout the world on the safety of nuclearinstallations. Such Calamities,which are far beyond our comprehension, has left all nations with such installations and those planning to expand their nuclear power plant programmes in a dilemma. However, the recent news that the Japanese authorities are considering to harvest and store bone marrow stem cells for transfusion to radiation-exposed workers has ushered in a new ray of hope. The hematopoietic stem cells will be harvested before exposure and in case of bone marrow depletion after radiation exposure; these cells can be immediately <b>retrieved</b> <b>from</b> <b>storage</b> and transfused <b>to</b> the radiation-exposed worker so that they have the potential to re-constitute the entire bone marrow in the patient. This will be a great life-saver and game-changer as bone marrow depletion is one of the major consequences of high levels of radiation exposure. This strategy can be prescribed as a routine procedure in all the countries with such nuclear installations, especially for workers at very high risk of radiation exposure. In future, such preventive strategies should be considered for implementation to not only the workers in the facility, but also the rescue team and the vulnerable population in the radiation zone. The regenerative potential of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) is the key factor to be considered now. This is high time that the studies on optimal in vitro expansion of HSCs and ways of successful engraftment of the transfused cells to a niche of radiation-exposed host environment should be attempted in all earnestness by the regenerative medicine community at present. Natural calamities like this help man to realise that the millions of scientific discoveries and inventions can never match ‘the nature of NATURE’. Such calamities, however, help us to re- position ourselves and demonstrate our immense capacity of resilience. Mankind will never perish as long as the “Strong will to survive” remains intact and the Science of Regenerative medicine teaches man the mortal, that anything can be repaired, restored or rejuvenated as long as the fountain of ideas, work and knowledge combined with hope and visions, remains immortal. "To suffer woes which Hope thinks infinite; To forgive wrongs darker than Death or Night; To defy Power, which seems Omnipotent; To love, and bear; to hope, till Hope creates From its own wreck the thing it contemplates; Neither to change nor falter nor repent; This, like thy glory, Titan! is to be Good, great and joyous, beautiful and free; This is alone Life, Joy, Empire and Victory.
