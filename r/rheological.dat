5|$|Thermoplastics, by contrast, form long {{molecular}} chains, {{which are}} often coiled or intertwined, forming an amorphous structure without any long-range, crystalline order. Some thermoplastics may be fully amorphous, while others have a partially crystalline/partially amorphous structure. Both amorphous and semicrystalline thermoplastics have a glass transition, above which welding can occur, but semicrystallines also have a specific melting point which is above the glass transition. Above this melting point, the viscous liquid will become a free-flowing liquid (see <b>rheological</b> weldability for thermoplastics). Examples of thermoplastics include polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride (PVC), and fluoroplastics like Teflon and Spectralon.|$|E

25|$|Thromboelastometry (TEM), {{previously}} named rotational thromboelastography (ROTEG) or rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), is {{an established}} viscoelastic method for hemostasis testing in whole blood. It is {{a modification of}} traditional thromboelastography (TEG). TEM investigates the interaction of coagulation factors, their inhibitors, anticoagulant drugs, blood cells, specifically platelets, during clotting and subsequent fibrinolysis. The <b>rheological</b> conditions mimic the sluggish flow of blood in veins. TEM is performed with the ROTEM whole blood analyzer (Tem Innovations GmbH, Munich) and is an enhancement of thrombelastography, originally described by H. Hartert in 1948.|$|E

In many cases, vermiculite-based roof screeds are {{used in conjunction with}} other insulation materials, such as polystyrene board, to form a total roofing system. A bituminous binder can also be used with exfoliated vermiculite to produce a dry, lightweight roof screed which has the advantages of low thermal conductivity, low moisture content, and ease of placement (by pouring from the bag and then tamping).|$|E

The storage modulus values are particularly high (104 Pa at 3% concentration) compared to results for cellulose nanowhiskers (102 Pa at 3% concentration). There is also a particular strong concentration dependence as the storage modulus increases 5 orders of magnitude if the concentration is increased from 0.125% to 5.9%.|$|E
2500|$|NMR has now {{entered the}} arena of {{real-time}} process control and process optimization in oil refineries and petrochemical plants. Two different types of NMR analysis are utilized to provide real time analysis of feeds and products {{in order to control}} and optimize unit operations. Time-domain NMR (TD-NMR) spectrometers operating at low field (2–20MHz for [...] ) yield free induction decay data {{that can be used to}} determine absolute hydrogen content values, <b>rheological</b> information, and component composition. These spectrometers are used in mining, polymer production, cosmetics and food manufacturing as well as coal analysis. High resolution FT-NMR spectrometers operating in the 60MHz range with shielded permanent magnet systems yield high resolution [...] NMR spectra of refinery and petrochemical streams. The variation observed in these spectra with changing physical and chemical properties is modeled using chemometrics to yield predictions on unknown samples. The prediction results are provided to control systems via analogue or digital outputs from the spectrometer.|$|E

5000|$|Generally, {{rheology}} is used {{to study}} the flow of matter within a substance. In order for a substance {{to be considered a}} gel it must possess solid-like traits when characterized by <b>rheological</b> measurements. <b>Rheological</b> characterization, tests materials by applying stress to measure the material's resistance to deformation. From <b>rheological</b> measurements, a gel can be classified as either a [...] "strong" [...] or [...] "weak" [...] gel. This classification emphasizes the strength of the interactions between gelator molecules in a particular gel. A [...] "weak" [...] gel is often not considered a true gel because it does not conform to a purely solid-like material's <b>rheological</b> traits.

50|$|<b>Rheological</b> {{weldability}} (RW) {{is proposed}} {{as a criterion}} to determine reliably weldability of thermoplastics. In a practical manner, RW of thermoplastics is assessed through their <b>rheological</b> properties: viscosity (η) and activation energy (Ea). According to RW criterion, the lower the viscosity (η) during welding process and the lower the absolute value of activation energy (|Ea|), the better the weldability.|$|E
5000|$|The lithosphere-asthenosphere {{boundary}} {{represents a}} <b>rheological</b> boundary. Colder temperatures at Earth's shallower depths affect the viscosity {{and strength of}} the lithosphere. Colder material in the lithosphere resists flow while the [...] "warmer" [...] material in the asthenosphere contributes to its lower viscosity. The increase in temperature with increasing depth {{is known as the}} geothermal gradient and is gradual within the <b>rheological</b> boundary layer. The lithosphere is the portion of the thermal boundary layer commonly defined by its purely conductive heat transport. Throughout the <b>rheological</b> boundary, the geotherm gradually transitions from the conductive nature of the lithospheric geotherm to the convective (adiabatic) nature of the underlying asthenosphere.|$|E

It is now well understood that the properties of various wheat storage proteins have a major effect on dough <b>rheological</b> properties. The gliadin and glutenin components contribute to dough quality either in an independent manner (additive genetic effects) or in interactive manner (epistatic effects). It was suggested that the apparent effects of gliadins on dough quality should be attributed to the LMW glutenins due to the close linkage of the Gli-1 and Glu-3 loci.

50|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{literature}} on food rheology because the study of food rheology entails unique factors beyond an understanding of the basic <b>rheological</b> dynamics of the flow and deformation of matter. Food can be classified according to its <b>rheological</b> state, such as a solid, gel, liquid, emulsion with associated <b>rheological</b> behaviors, and its <b>rheological</b> properties can be measured. These properties will affect the design of food processing plants, as well as shelf life and other important factors, including sensory properties that appeal to consumers. Because foods are structurally complex, often a mixture of fluid and solids with varying properties within a single mass, the study of food rheology is more complicated than study in fields such as the rheology of polymers. However, food rheology is something we experience every day with our perception of food texture (see below) and basic concepts of food rheology well apply to polymers physics, oil flow etc. For this reason, examples of food rheology are didactically useful to explain the dynamics of other materials we are less familiar with. Ketchup is commonly used an example of Bingham fluid and its flow behavior can be compared to that of a polymer melt.|$|E
