5|$|Generally, {{the first}} bones to be {{affected}} are the fingers, facial bones, <b>ribs,</b> <b>and</b> pelvis. Long bones, which are longer than they are wide, are also among the first affected. As the disease progresses, any bone may be affected.|$|E
5|$|The transepts have boarded {{ceilings}} with heavier <b>ribs,</b> <b>and</b> three by six panels, each panel subdivided in four, with brattishing and {{a band of}} quatrefoils to the wall-plate. Each transept {{has pointed}} tomb recesses in the end wall.|$|E
5|$|A {{slightly}} variant way of executing {{people by}} means of impalement was to force an iron meat hook beneath a person's <b>ribs</b> <b>and</b> hang him up to die slowly. This technique was in 18th century Ottoman-controlled Bosnia called the cengela, but the practice is also attested, for example, in 1770s Dutch Suriname as a punishment meted out to rebellious slaves.|$|E

40|$|During embryogenesis, {{primordial}} {{germ cells}} (PGCs) and somatic gonadal precursor cells (SGPs) migrate and coalesce {{to form the}} early gonad. A failure of the PGCs and SGPs to form a gonad with the proper architecture not only affects germ cell development, but {{can also lead to}} infertility. Therefore, it is critical to identify the molecular mechanisms that function within both the PGCs and SGPs to promote gonad morphogenesis. We have characterized the phenotypes of two genes, longitudinals lacking (lola) <b>and</b> ribbon (<b>rib),</b> that are required for the coalescence and compaction of the embryonic gonad in Drosophila melanogaster. <b>rib</b> <b>and</b> lola are expressed in the SGPs of the developing gonad, and genetic interaction analysis suggests these proteins cooperate to regulate gonad development. Both genes encode proteins with DNA binding motifs and a conserved protein-protein interaction domain, known as the Broad complex, Tramtrack, Bric-à-brac (BTB) domain. Through molecular modeling and yeast-two hybrid studies, we demonstrate that <b>Rib</b> <b>and</b> Lola homo- and heterodimerize via their BTB domains. In addition, analysis of the colocalization of <b>Rib</b> <b>and</b> Lola with marks of transcriptional activation and repression on polytene chromosomes reveals that <b>Rib</b> <b>and</b> Lola colocalize with both repressive and activating marks and with each other. While previous studies have identified <b>Rib</b> <b>and</b> Lola targets in other tissues, we find that <b>Rib</b> <b>and</b> Lola are likely to function via different downstream targets in the gonad. These results suggest that <b>Rib</b> <b>and</b> Lola act as dual-function transcription factors to cooperatively regulate embryonic gonad morphogenesis...|$|R

5|$|Accompanying {{injuries}} often play a {{key role}} in the outcome. Injuries that may accompany TBI include pulmonary contusion and laceration; and fractures of the sternum, <b>ribs</b> <b>and</b> clavicles. Spinal cord injury, facial trauma, traumatic aortic rupture, injuries to the abdomen, lung, and head are present in 40–100%. The most common accompanying injury is esophageal perforation or rupture (known as Boerhaave syndrome), which occurs in as many as 43% of the penetrating injuries to the neck that cause tracheal injury.|$|E

5|$|The air sacs, which hold air, do not {{contribute}} much to gas exchange, despite being thin-walled, {{as they are}} poorly vascularised.

5|$|A new tyrannosaurid {{specimen}} (OMNH 10131), including skull fragments, <b>ribs</b> <b>and</b> {{parts of}} the hindlimb, was reported from New Mexico in 1990 and assigned to the now-defunct genus Aublysodon. Many later authors have reassigned this specimen, {{along with a few}} others from New Mexico, to yet another unnamed species of Daspletosaurus. However, research published in 2010 showed that this species, from the Hunter Wash Member of the Kirtland Formation, is actually a more primitive tyrannosauroid, and was classified in the genus Bistahieversor. There is currently disagreement over the age of the Kirtland Formation, with some workers claiming a late Campanian age, while others suggest a younger age in the early Maastrichtian stage.|$|E
5|$|All {{versions}} of the Su-25 have a metal cantilever wing, of moderate sweep, high aspect ratio and equipped with high-lift devices. The wing consists of two cantilever sections attached to a central torsion box, forming a single unit with the fuselage. The air brakes are housed in fairings {{at the tip of}} each wing. Each wing has five hardpoints for weapons carriage, with the attachment points mounted on load-bearing <b>ribs</b> <b>and</b> spars. Each wing also features a five-section leading edge slat, a two-section flap and an aileron.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{the health}} of the Dry Island Albertosaurus {{assembly}} was reported upon. Most specimens showed no sign of disease. On three phalanges of the foot strange bony spurs, consisting of abnormal ossifications of the tendons, so-called enthesophytes, were present, their cause unknown. Two <b>ribs</b> <b>and</b> a belly-rib showed signs of breaking and healing. One adult specimen had a left lower jaw showing a puncture wound and both healed and unhealed bite marks. The low number of abnormalities compares favourably with the health condition of a Majungasaurus population of which it in 2007 was established that 19% of individuals showed bone pathologies.|$|E

5|$|Initially, as {{in some of}} the {{continental}} cathedrals, the interior was decorated with designs emphasizing the arch <b>ribs</b> <b>and</b> portal components. Even the brick was painted with red and white stripes. In the 15th century, frescos of figures in the Late Gothic style with decorative vine leaves were painted {{in various parts of the}} church. Traces of these have been found in the chancel and in the chapel which was originally dedicated to St Eric and St Olaf. Unfortunately, they have now been heavily restored. The frescos in the chancel were probably painted by Albertus Pictor's workshop.|$|E

He then started a {{relationship with}} Emma Beal, together having two children, Thomas (born December 2002) and Mia (born March 2004). At a May 2002 party in Tufnell Park, Livingstone got into an argument with Beal's friend Robin Hedges, {{a reporter for the}} Evening Standard. Hedges subsequently fell off of a wall, bruised his <b>ribs</b> <b>and</b> ended up in hospital; the press claimed that Livingstone had pushed him, although he insisted that he did not. Liberal Democrats on the London Assembly referred the matter to the Standards Board for England, who ruled that there was no evidence for any wrongdoing on Livingstone's behalf.|$|E
5|$|Martínez Pérez {{was murdered}} {{early in the}} morning of 28 April 2012 in her home in the Felipe Carrillo Puerto {{neighborhood}} in Xalapa, the capital of Veracruz. When police went to her home to investigate in response to a neighbor's call about her door being open all day, Martínez Pérez's corpse was found on the bathroom floor. According to official reports, she had been severely beaten around her face and <b>ribs,</b> <b>and</b> then strangled to death. The cause of death was asphyxia by strangulation. At the time of her death, the Mexican authorities said they were investigating all the possible motives behind her assassination, including personal motives and theft, and that they would investigate whether the killing was work-related.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – In {{the present}} investigation, the {{influence}} of water and mineral contents on the ultrasonic parameters of bovine bone scapula, <b>rib</b> <b>and</b> femur has been studied. It is found that the water is comparatively high in scapula (12 %) and low in femur (10 %) {{when compared to the}} rib (11 %). From the data on density, {{it is obvious that the}} deposition of calcium phosphate in the matrix of collagen is more or less homogenous for femur, whereas in the case of scapula <b>and</b> <b>rib,</b> the deposition is inhomogeneous. Among the bones studied, the calcium deposition is comparatively high in femur than <b>rib</b> <b>and</b> scapula, while the magnesium content is low. Study shows the compressional wave velocity in bovine scapula, <b>rib</b> <b>and</b> femur is more or less the same in scapula <b>and</b> <b>rib,</b> but comparatively less in femur. While the values of shear wave velocity in <b>rib</b> <b>and</b> femur are in the close range, but more than scapula. The coefficient of absorption of compressional wave in bovine scapula, <b>rib</b> <b>and</b> femur values lie in a close range with respect to scapula <b>and</b> <b>rib</b> are more when compared to femur. It is found that phosphorous is less than 1 %; Si, Fe, Cu, Al, are less than 0. 1 %, while Ba, Sr, Pb, Zn are very much less than the traces i. e., less than 0. 001 %. The element magnesium is present in bones studied in the range of 1 to 3 %, more in scapula (3 %) less in femur (1 %) when compared to rib (2 %). Index Terms – calcium phosphate...|$|R
