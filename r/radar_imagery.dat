5|$|Late on October23, <b>radar</b> <b>imagery</b> {{depicted}} {{the formation of}} a secondary outer eyewall, indicative of an eyewall replacement cycle. By 20:30UTC, the final pass by reconnaissance, the hurricane's flight-level winds fell by 60mph (95km/h) and its central pressure rose at 8mbar (hPa; 0.24inHg) per hour. Coinciding with the eyewall replacement cycle was an increase in southwesterly wind shear, a factor that further accelerated Patricia's degradation. The hurricane's eye soon became cloud-filled and rapid weakening ensued at an unprecedented pace.|$|E

5|$|Both {{direct and}} {{indirect}} ways {{have been found to}} indicate the presence of a wake depression. The most direct is through the use of surface observations. Prior to the development of mesoscale weather station networks, or mesonets, it was difficult to locate wake lows. With the advent of mesoscale networks, wake lows have become easier to detect. On weather satellite and weather <b>radar</b> <b>imagery,</b> wake lows and heat bursts normally occur on the rear side of a precipitation area. However, within larger precipitation areas, they can be located within the area showing a minimum of returns. When using velocity data from a WSR-88D doppler radar, high winds on the back edge of reflectivity data can give away the location of a wake low.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Gamede {{remained}} a broad system, and by February 24 it produced winds of near gale force up to 670km (415mi) southeast of its center; {{later in the}} day, it passed about 300km (190mi) north of Réunion, its closest point of approach to the island. For over 90hours, the cyclone remained within 400km (250mi) of the island, resulting in torrential rainfall in the island's mountainous region. <b>Radar</b> <b>imagery</b> on the island indicated Gamede maintained an eye diameter of 60–70km (37–43mi).

Initially, it was predicted to continue westward and strike Madagascar near Toamasina. The cyclone re-intensified while executing a small loop, and late on February 25 Gamede officially attained peak winds of 165km/h (105mph) about halfway between Réunion island and the coast of Madagascar; at the time, wind gusts in association with the storm reached 230km/h (135mph).|$|E

5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{initially}} {{thought the}} center {{might not have}} been at the surface, and the agency indicated low forecasting confidence, as they could not determine a circulation center. The difficulty arose from the large, sprawling nature of the storm, and by later on May 27 a new center formed, as confirmed by <b>radar</b> <b>imagery</b> and the Hurricane Hunters. That night, the extremely small center made landfall just south of Savannah, Georgia, affecting a very small area with winds of 65mph (100km/h) and a minimum pressure of 991 mbar (hPa; 29.26 inHg).

5|$|The {{origins of}} Humberto {{are from the}} {{remnants}} of a frontal trough—the same that spawned Tropical Storm Gabrielle—that moved offshore south Florida on September 5. The combination of a weak surface trough and an upper-level low pressure system produced disorganized showers and thunderstorms from western Cuba into the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Tracking slowly west-northwestward, unfavorable wind shear initially inhibited tropical cyclone development. By late on September 11, environmental conditions became more favorable, and the following morning convection increased over the disturbance. Tracking around the western periphery of a mid-level ridge, the system turned on a slow northwest drift and quickly organized. <b>Radar</b> <b>imagery</b> reported loose banding features, and buoy data indicated the presence of a surface circulation; based on the observations, the National Hurricane Center classified the system as Tropical Depression Nine, while located roughly 60miles (100km) southeast of Matagorda, Texas.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Jeanne quickly {{organized}} {{over the}} eastern Caribbean Sea, developing a tight inner core and well-defined outflow as it tracked over warm water temperatures of about 84°F (29°C). Initially, {{the storm was}} forecast to attain hurricane status before crossing Puerto Rico. However, its organization deteriorated by early on September 15, with <b>radar</b> <b>imagery</b> tracking a low-level circulation {{moving away from the}} convection. The temporary weakening was due increased shear and dry air. At 1600UTC on September 15, Jeanne made landfall near Guayama, Puerto Rico with winds of 70mph (115km/h), and as it moved ashore it {{was in the process of}} developing an eye. Across the territory, the storm produced heavy rainfall, peaking at 23.75inches (605mm) on Vieques Island. Rainfall across the region resulted in moderate to severe river flooding, with several river stations in Puerto Rico reporting historical levels. Light winds, generally around tropical storm force, affected the region as well.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression was forecast to strengthen slowly to reach peak winds of 45mph (75km/h). Within {{three hours of}} forming, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Humberto. A small cyclone, the storm continued to organize quickly as it turned north-northeastward, while <b>radar</b> <b>imagery</b> suggested {{the formation of an}} eye by early on September 13. Based on reports from Hurricane Hunters, Humberto was upgraded to a hurricane at 0515UTC on September 13, while located about 15miles (20km) off the coast of Texas. The hurricane made landfall a few miles to the east of High Island at around 0700UTC. A well-defined eye was maintained with strong convection around it, and Hurricane Hunters reported sustained winds of 85mph (140km/h) about two hours after landfall. However, post-storm analysis later determined that the winds were a bit stronger—about 90mph (150km/h).|$|E
5|$|With {{warm water}} {{temperatures}} of over 86°F (30°C) and low wind shear, {{the newly formed}} tropical depression was able to quickly intensify. It developed a well-defined center with concentrated deep convection. Continued organization prompted the NHC to upgrade the depression to Tropical Storm Barbara at 0000UTC on May29. Post-analysis indicated that Barbara intensified into a tropical storm six hours earlier than originally assessed. Barbara began exhibiting an eye-like feature, and intensity estimates using the Dvorak Technique reached 40mph (65km/h). At this time, Barbara had begun to recurve to the northeast, within a gap of the subtropical ridge. By midnight, the eye-like feature developed into a central dense overcast (CDO), embedded within the deep convection. The rainbands of Barbara wrapped around much of the circulation, and <b>radar</b> <b>imagery</b> indicated the eyewall was consistently becoming better defined. Thereafter, the storm entered a phase of intensification as it began to accelerate towards the Chiapan coastline.|$|E

On 12 th Jan 2010, earthquake of moment magnitude 7 hit Haiti causing widespread casualty and destruction to the infrastructures. This earthquake was responsible for death of 217, 000 people, injury to 300, 000 people and homeless for 1. 2 million people. It was the deadliest event in the history of Haiti. Two sets of high resolution <b>radar</b> <b>imageries</b> from TerraSAR-X (each set of pre-event and post-event imagery) were used for the damage detection in city center of Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti. Radar characteristics like correlation coefficient and backscatter differences were calculated and threshold values of them were overlaid to optical images. Changes like building damage after the earthquake were clearly recognized...|$|R
40|$|Gaussian {{smoothed}} SAR image spectra {{have been}} evaluated from 512 x 512 pixel sub-scenes of image mode ERS- 1 SAR scenes off Goa, Visakhapatnam, Paradeep and Portugal. The two recently acquired scenes off Portugal showed the signature of swell of wavelength § 200 m and internal waves of wavelength> 400 m. Only internal waves of wavelength> 400 m were seen in the scene off Goa observed on 11 March 1992. The scenes off Visakhapatnam and Paradeep did not show any wave like features, the latter appearing to be of "white noise" nature. There exists a 180 ° ambiguity in wave direction observed from <b>radar</b> <b>imageries.</b> Based on the method of Atanassov et al (1985), a computer program has been developed {{for the removal of}} the 180 ° ambiguity by using two images of the same area separated by a time interval which is small compared to the period of the dominant waves.

5|$|By 1999, {{computer}} systems and software had finally become sophisticated {{enough to allow}} for the ability to underlay on the same workstation satellite imagery, <b>radar</b> <b>imagery,</b> and model-derived fields such as atmospheric thickness and frontogenesis in combination with surface observations to make for the best possible surface analysis. In the United States, this development was achieved when Intergraph workstations were replaced by n-AWIPS workstations. By 2001, the various surface analyses done within the National Weather Service were combined into the Unified Surface Analysis, which is issued every six hours and combines the analyses of four different centers. Recent advances in both the fields of meteorology and geographic information systems have made it possible to devise finely tailored products that take us from the traditional weather map into an entirely new realm. Weather information can quickly be matched to relevant geographical detail. For instance, icing conditions can be mapped onto the road network. This will likely continue to lead to changes in the way surface analyses are created and displayed over the next several years.|$|E
5|$|By August16, {{the forward}} motion of Ana began to increase, and the storm quickly entered {{a region of}} dry, stable air. By the afternoon, a Hurricane Hunter {{reconnaissance}} mission {{did not find any}} evidence of tropical storm-force winds, resulting in Ana being downgraded to a tropical depression. It was determined in post-storm analysis, that Ana had degenerated into a tropical wave shortly afterwards, and was no longer a tropical cyclone. Several hours later, the system redeveloped convection as it raced towards the west-northwest at 26mph (42km/h). Early on August17, <b>radar</b> <b>imagery</b> from Guadeloupe and San Juan, Puerto Rico depicted a system without a closed, low-level circulation. Despite this, the NHC continued operational advisories until confirmation could be made with visible satellite imagery. Later that day, a final reconnaissance plane flew into the storm and did not find a low-level circulation. Following this, the NHC stated that Ana had dissipated off the coast of Puerto Rico, despite having already degenerated into a tropical wave the previous day. The remnants of Ana were once more monitored for signs of regeneration, but land interaction with Hispaniola and Cuba spoiled the system's chances of redevelopment.|$|E
5|$|The {{thunderstorm}} {{that would}} eventually produce the infamous F3tornado in Fort Worth developed from a cluster of storms that formed west of the city. At 4:38p.m. CST (22:38UTC), a severe thunderstorm warning was issued on the quickly organizing storm for Parker County. About an hour later, another severe thunderstorm warning was issued, this time for Tarrant County, as the storm continued to track eastward. <b>Radar</b> <b>imagery</b> showed that the supercell was rapidly organizing, developing a bounded weak echo region and hook echo—radar signatures that hint at a strong and potentially tornadic thunderstorm—in less than a half-hour.

At around the same time, a wall cloud was spotted in association with the rotating thunderstorm while baseball-sized hail fell ahead of the rotation in northern Fort Worth along Interstate 820. Winds from the downdraft of another small thunderstorm south of Fort Worth allowed the strengthening supercell to organize further.

50|$|Tropical Storm Nesat {{began to}} intensify slowly as it tracked {{generally}} northwestward {{along the western}} edge of an extension of the subtropical ridge centered to the east, aided by a weak anticyclone over the system and a vigorous equatorward outflow channel.
