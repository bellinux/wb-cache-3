25|$|The {{initial report}} of the Boundary Commission for England dated October 1947 and {{published}} in December 1947 recommended that Leicester retain three seats, including a revised Leicester South constituency consisting of the wards of Aylestone, De Montfort, Knighton, North Braunstone and Spinney Hill, giving an electorate of 67,574 as of the <b>review</b> <b>date</b> of 15 October 1946. When the Representation of the People Bill enacting the Commission's recommendations was debated in the House of Commons, the Government brought forward amendments at Committee stage on 24 March 1948 to allow 17 more constituencies in England. Home Secretary James Chuter Ede announced that the Boundary Commission would be invited to consider an additional constituency to each of nine cities, including Leicester. The Government issued a White Paper proposing the new boundaries which created new borough constituencies of Leicester South East and Leicester South West in place of Leicester South. The Boundary Commission recommended no alteration to the proposals, and the revised constituencies were therefore enacted.|$|E

Companies which have fewer than 25% of shares considered free float on Euronext Amsterdam are, however, ineligible for inclusion. Unlike some other European benchmark equity indices (such as the OMXS30), if a company has more than one class of shares traded on the exchange, only the most frequently traded of these will be accepted into the AEX. If a company or companies are removed from the index due to delisting, acquisition or another reason, no replacements are made until the next <b>review</b> <b>date.</b>|$|E

50|$|Philip Sheedy, an architect, was {{involved}} in a road traffic accident in March 1996 at the Glenview Roundabout, Tallaght Bypass, County Dublin which resulted in the death of Anne Ryan. It transpired that Sheedy, who was driving a high performance sports car that he had purchased the previous day, was intoxicated. Sheedy plead guilty to causing death by dangerous driving before His Honour Judge Cyril Kelly (as he was then) in Dublin Circuit Criminal Court in October 1997 and also admitted to driving with excess alcohol. On the day of sentencing Judge Joseph Mathews was asked by Judge Kelly to step-in and sentence Sheedy. Judge Matthews imposed a four-year sentence on Sheedy with leave to apply for a review of the sentence after two years (20 October 1999), as well as banning him from driving for twelve years. On 6 November 1997 Judge Mathews granted an application on Sheedy's behalf to vacate the order which set 20 October 1999 as the <b>review</b> <b>date</b> of Sheedy's sentence.|$|E

5000|$|The {{final stage}} of {{classification}} is having eligibility determined and then being put into a class. [...] There are several status and classes, of which one is [...] "Ineligible". [...] Other classification statuses include New, Review, Confirmed, and Fixed <b>Review</b> <b>Date.</b> Following being put into a class or being ruled ineligible, {{the next step is}} to inform the sportsperson of this decision. [...] Another potential status is Non-Cooperative. This occurs when the sportsperson did not, according to the Classification Panel, cooperate during the classification process. When this occurs, sportspeople need to wait three or more months before being eligible to apply for classification again. If a sportsperson is determined to be eligible for more than one class in the same sport, the sportsperson must make a decision as to which class they want to compete in as they cannot be classified into two different classes in the same sport at the same time. [...] They may opt to change classes at the end of the sporting season or at after the Paralympic Games depending on the rules for the sport.|$|E
5000|$|Buchanan's first {{published}} works were books of poetry written {{while he was}} still living in Glasgow. He appears to have disowned them later in life as they fail to appear in any bibliographic references. His first book was Poems and Love Lyrics which although undated was probably published in 1857. It was reviewed in the Athenaeum in December 1857. Although the <b>review</b> <b>date</b> is not conclusive the date is almost certainly 1857 or 1858 for the following reasons. (1) The author's second book Mary and other Poems is by the 'Author of Lyrics'. This book is dated 1859 and signed Robt W Buchanan in the preface; (2) The preface to 'Mary' states that this is the author's second published book; (3) The preface indicates that the writer is still a young man; (4) The dedication to Hugh Macdonald suggests he was alive when it was written. Macdonald, a well-known Glaswegian, died in 1860. Buchanan's second book Mary and other Poems was published in 1859 and has never been mentioned in any bibliographies. The book is extremely rare and the only copies appear to be in the Mitchell library in Glasgow. Buchanan also published {{a collection of short stories}} and poems, written in collaboration with Charles Gibbon, entitled Storm-beaten, or Christmas Eve at the [...] "Old Anchor" [...] Inn in 1862, before Undertones, which is often cited as Buchanan's first book.|$|E
