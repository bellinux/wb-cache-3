40|$|Rating {{agencies}} represent one of {{the main}} information providers for all the main financial markets whose value depends both on their reputation and on their degree of independence in respect to rated entities. The fee payment solution adopted by major rating agencies exposes them to a risk of collusion between rating and <b>rated</b> <b>entity</b> because the fee for their service is mainly paid by the evaluated entity. In order to ensure the accuracy of a rating agency evaluation, a firm could hire more than one rating agency. Studies published in relevant literature demonstrate that the market normally appreciates the availability of ratings evaluated by different agencies and the <b>rated</b> <b>entity</b> can so benefit from its expanded reputation in the market. This paper examines the customers of the main worldwide rating agencies (Fitch, Moody’s and S&P) during the period of time from 1999 - 2008. The results demonstrate that the multi-rating solution is frequently adopted by their customers and normally, the choice to hire more than one rating agency is affected by the type of rating requested, the variability of rating assigned and the number of new ratings that will be demanded...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} {{we deal with}} the {{question}} of whether the evaluation of selected rating agencies is equivalent in some sense or not and whether it is possible to find a relationship between assessments. The fact that rating agencies affect not only financial market participants (by publication of companies or states ratings) is undeniable. On the one hand, these agencies are criticized for the rating changes, which have influence for example credit conditions for <b>rated</b> <b>entity.</b> On the other hand, ratings have a growing number of users for which ratings have become one of the few clues in today’s complicated conditions powered by global financial crisis. For this purpose we use the calibration problem techniques, because calibration finds a relationship between two measurements, in our case between two independent assessments of rating agencies. Due to the nature of the data we assume that the relationship can be described by linear or quadratic function. So we use estimates derived for the one-dimensional linear calibration model with quadratic calibration function. This all we illustrate by the real ratings. The situation is complicated by the ordinal type data of the examined variables. Among other things, we discuss relations between ratings coming from particular rating agencies and evolution of this relation over time...|$|E
40|$|A {{credit rating}} is {{technically}} an ‘opinion ’ {{on the relative}} degree of risk associated with timely payment of interest and principal on a debt instrument. It is ‘informed ’ indication of the likelihood of default of an issuer on a debt instrument, relative to the respective likelihood of default of other issuers in market. It is therefore an independent, easy-to-use measure of relative credit risk. Given the universal reliance on rating, and hence {{the power of the}} opinion, credit rating is expected to increase the efficiency of the market by reducing information asymmetry and lowering costs for both borrowers and lenders. A simple alphanumeric symbol is normally used to convey a credit rating. Ordinarily the company which issues the debt instruments is not rated. It is the instrument which is rated by the rating agency. But the issuer company which has the debt instrument gets strength and credibility with the grade of rating awarded to the credit instrument it intends to issue to the public for raising funds. Though the purpose of rating is to rate instruments, a general perception may be gathered that the organization issues a highly rated instrument is also sound and a highly <b>rated</b> <b>entity.</b> Thus, credit rating is a mechanism whereby an independent third party makes an assessment, based on different sources of information on the credit quality of the assessed...|$|E
40|$|Trust {{underlies}} effective {{interactions among}} autonomous parties. Ideally, a truster would base its trust in a trustee {{on the evidence}} of prior experiences with the trustee. But, such experiences arise between only a few trusters and trustees. Thus, a truster must rely upon the propagation of trust through a path of intermediary agents, each providing a trust assessment in the next. However, existing propagation approaches fail in settings such as social communities and product evaluations where a forward path isn’t available and we must consider a backward path from a <b>rated</b> <b>entity</b> to a rater. We propose Shin, a generalized trust propagation approach that incorporates a recent probabilistic method for revising trust estimates in trustees. Shin yields higher prediction accuracy than traditional approaches. In settings such as e-commerce and social networks, trust provides the basis for interaction among autonomous agents [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. We define a truster’s trust in a trustee as the truster’s belief that a future interaction with the trustee will yield expected outcomes [7]. Trust relationships naturally form a trust network, a weighted directed graph whose vertices represent agents and whose edges represent directed trust relationships, weighted {{with the level of}} trust. Each edge weight is affected by the outcomes of prior interactions and determines whether its source agent elects to pursue a future interaction with its target. A centralized reputation system consolidates the trust network. In a decentralized setting, each agent knows of only its own out-edges. A truster can reasonably decide whether to interact with a (prospective) trustee based on its estimation of the latter’s trustworthiness. A truster that lacks direct experience with a trustee would rely upon referrals leading to witnesses who provide testimony of their experiences with the trustee. Restricting the witnesses to direct experience helps avoid double counting evidence. Trust propagation [8, 9] means estimating trust over referral paths. Existing approaches consider only forward paths wherein each agent trusts the next. Our propagation technique, Shin (from the Chinese word for trust), applies even if no suitable forward path exists provided a path from both the truster and trustee to a common neighbor exists...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{evaluating}} {{the success of}} {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} in the international process. The process of internationalization of small and medium-sized businesses is frequently discussed topic. In this article is discussed a simple evaluation model that could be used by SMEs to determine not only how strong are they compared to competitors, but also at what level are their success factors in the process of internationalization. A lot of SMEs have problems to identify the key success factors in the process of internationalization, as well as to determine in what areas, that success in foreign markets determine, have their strengths and weaknesses, therefore we decided to focus on this problem and there is presented a proposal of a simple model of performance evaluation of small and medium-sized enterprises in this paper. The key success factors of internationalization process are identified according to a survey of 40 small and medium engineering companies and also the use of the knowledge of literature and similar surveys conducted abroad. The key success factors of internationalization process were grouped into 4 categories: 1) Key employee, 2) Internationalization rate, 3) International marketing, 4) Efficiency of foreign trade. The proposed rating system because of its graphical output simply shows what the area has a <b>rated</b> <b>entity</b> weaknesses and where its strengths has. The model was applied to data obtained from a above mentioned survey and in the paper there are presented specific examples of graphical output of the model for selected companies. For SMEs {{it is often difficult to}} succeed and then to maintain the position in the foreign markets than for large multinational companies. Large enterprises have more opportunities to detailed analysis and evaluation of factors that have to determine their success in the field of internationalization. In the current literature there are not many models which SMEs have shown how easily assess their situation in internationalization process. The authors followed up on previous efforts to design assessment method of evaluating the international success of small and medium sized enterprises (Peprný, Kubíčková, Rovný, 2009), however they tried to simplify the previously presented method to be applicable to SMEs in practice and they have tried to adapt the evaluation model to the needs of small and medium sized companies. The proposed rating system could be further adjusted in practice. It is possible to modify the weight of individual blocks as needed for particular businesses. ...|$|E

In order to understand if the spread behaves in a different manner when the system has excess liquidity vis-à-vis shortage of liquidity, a Regime Switching model using Goldfeld and Quandt’s D-method for switching regression was used. The tests found that the monetary policy is stable in both the regimes and the effectiveness of monetary policy in both the regimes are not statistically different. ...|$|R

We document that CDS and bond spreads have deviated from their parity condition (the basis has become persistently negative) and are no more moving together, in contrasts with what reported by other studies conducted prior to the crisis. We investigate the role played by the cost of trading the basis studying its relation with CDS and bond spreads.

30|$|DEA {{has proved}} to be an {{effective}} empirical tool for identifying multi-criteria efficient frontiers, for subsequently evaluating relative performance efficiencies, and for implicitly estimating the tradeoffs inherent within the empirically designed frontier. DEA’s empirical orientation and absence of a priori assumptions establish it as the ideal analytical instrument for application {{to a wide variety of}} practical situations, since its underlying theoretical basis is consistent with the practice of <b>rating</b> <b>entities</b> by concurrently examining the relative efficiencies of their multiple performance measures. Furthermore, DEA allows performance comparisons to be made between numerous entities that have been evaluated by multiple, unit-incomparable measures without employing any a priori weightings or conversion factors typically required in other methods. Since the process is adaptable and invariant to data type, DEA permits the inclusion and comparison of non-numeric environmental-type variables that might prove incomparable using many other techniques (Zhu [2003]). By incorporating DEA into its DSS, the focus of performance evaluation for the TDSB application could shift from a characterization of each school’s energy and waste usage in terms of single measures to evaluating performance from a mathematically rational, multidimensional system perspective (Linton et al. [2007]; Yeomans [2004]). Consequently, inherent energy and waste relationships and their role in performance ranking can be explicitly brought into the analysis in a rational, transparent, and neutral fashion.|$|R
