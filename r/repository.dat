5|$|Conceptual {{design of}} a {{permanent}} <b>repository</b> was determined by 1983, calling for placement of copper-clad iron canisters in granite bedrock about 500 metres underground, below the water table in {{what is known as}} the KBS-3 method. Space around the canisters will be filled with bentonite clay. After examining six possible locations for a permanent <b>repository,</b> three were nominated for further investigation, at Osthammar, Oskarshamn, and Tierp. On 3 June 2009, Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Co. chose a location for a deep-level waste site at Östhammar, near Forsmark Nuclear Power plant. The application to build the <b>repository</b> was handed in by SKB 2011.|$|E
5|$|Environmental {{assessment}} of four sites occurred in 1997–98, Posiva chose the Olkiluoto site near two existing reactors, {{and the local}} government approved it in 2000. The Finnish Parliament approved a deep geologic <b>repository</b> there in igneous bedrock {{at a depth of}} about 500 meters in 2001. The <b>repository</b> concept is similar to the Swedish model, with containers to be clad in copper and buried below the water table beginning in 2020. An underground characterization facility, Onkalo spent nuclear fuel <b>repository,</b> was under construction at the site in 2012.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, the {{government}} decided {{to select a}} site for permanent <b>repository</b> by 2010. With four nuclear reactors providing 29% of its electricity, Finland in 1987 enacted a Nuclear Energy Act making the producers of radioactive waste responsible for its disposal, subject to requirements of its Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority and an absolute veto given to local governments in which a proposed <b>repository</b> would be located. Producers of nuclear waste organized the company Posiva, with responsibility for site selection, construction and operation of a permanent <b>repository.</b> A 1994 amendment to the Act required final disposal of spent fuel in Finland, prohibiting the import or export of radioactive waste.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 2009, the Obama {{administration}} {{attempted to}} close the Yucca Mountain <b>repository,</b> despite current US law that designates Yucca Mountain as the nation's nuclear waste <b>repository.</b> The administration agency, DOE, began implementation of the President's plan in May 2009. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission also {{went along with the}} administration's closure plan. Various state and Congressional entities attempted to challenge the administration's closure plans, by statute and in court.|$|E
5|$|The DOE was {{scheduled}} to begin accepting spent fuel at the Yucca Mountain <b>repository</b> by January 31, 1998. , years after this deadline, the future status of the <b>repository</b> at Yucca Mountain was still unknown due to on-going litigation, and opposition by Senator Harry Reid.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss {{program is}} {{considering}} {{options for the}} siting of a deep <b>repository</b> for high-level radioactive waste disposal, and for low & intermediate level wastes.

40|$|Source control <b>repositories,</b> bug <b>repositories,</b> {{archived}} communications, deployment logs, and code <b>repositories</b> {{are examples}} of software <b>repositories</b> that are commonly available for most software projects. The Mining Software <b>Repositories</b> (MSR) field analyzes and cross-links the rich data available in these <b>repositories</b> to uncover interesting and actionable information about software systems. By transforming these <b>repositories</b> from static record-keeping ones into active <b>repositories,</b> we can guide decision processes in modern software projects. For example, data in source control <b>repositories,</b> traditionally used to archive code, could be linked with data in bug <b>repositories</b> to help practitioners propagate complex changes and to warn them about risky code based on prior changes and bugs. In this paper, we present {{a brief history of}} the MSR field and discuss several recent achievements and results of using MSR techniques to support software research and practice. We then discuss the various opportunities and challenges that lie in the road ahead for this important and emerging field. ...|$|R

5|$|Theodor Mommsen {{linked the}} {{establishment}} of the law school in Beirut with the need for jurists, since the city was chosen to serve as a <b>repository</b> for Roman imperial edicts concerning the eastern provinces. After arriving in Beirut, these were translated into Greek, published and archived. This function was first recorded in 196, the date of the earliest constitutions contained in the Gregorian Codex, but the city is thought to have served as a <b>repository</b> since earlier times. The proximity of the <b>repository</b> to the law school allowed the Beiruti jurists to consult archived documents and for students to learn of the most recent imperial decrees—an advantage that the law schools of Caesarea Maritima and Alexandria lacked.|$|E
5|$|Although Australia {{does not}} have any nuclear power reactors, Pangea Resources {{considered}} siting an international <b>repository</b> in the outback of South Australia or Western Australia in 1998, but this stimulated legislative opposition in both states and the Australian national Senate during the following year. Thereafter, Pangea ceased operations in Australia but reemerged as Pangea International Association, and in 2002 evolved into the Association for Regional and International Underground Storage with support from Belgium, Bulgaria, Hungary, Japan and Switzerland. A general concept for an international <b>repository</b> has been advanced by one of the principals in all three ventures. Russia has expressed interest in serving as a <b>repository</b> for other countries, but does not envision sponsorship or control by an international body or group of other countries. South Africa, Argentina and western China have also been mentioned as possible locations.|$|E

40|$|University {{libraries}} {{are developing}} and maintaining institutional <b>repositories</b> {{as a means}} of managing and disseminating digital materials. In most instances, these materials are created by the staff of the university and institutional <b>repositories</b> serve to disseminate information on the academic activities of the university community. There is a move amongst universities worldwide to develop and maintain their own institutional <b>repositories.</b> The size of the collection may range from hundreds to thousands and universities in Malaysia are showing signs of interest in this area. Numerous Malaysian public universities are slowly but surely developing institutional <b>repositories</b> either in isolation or collectively as a consortium. This paper presents the status of institutional <b>repositories</b> which are hosted by Malaysian public university libraries. As at 28 October 2008, the Registry of Open Access <b>Repositories</b> lists seven Malaysian institutional <b>repositories</b> and only four of them are from university libraries. This number is extremely small when compared to the existence of 20 public universities throughout Malaysia. Findings indicate that the other libraries are at various stages of developing their institutional <b>repositories.</b> Some are at the initial stage of designing and developing their <b>repositories</b> whilst others are enriching the contents of their <b>repositories...</b>|$|R

5|$|Spent {{nuclear fuel}} is the {{radioactive}} by-product of electricity generation at commercial nuclear power plants, and {{high-level radioactive waste}} is the by-product from reprocessing spent fuel to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons. In 1982, the United States Congress established a national policy {{to solve the problem}} of nuclear waste disposal. This policy is a federal law called the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which made the DOE responsible for finding a site, building, and operating an underground disposal facility called a geologic <b>repository.</b> The recommendation to use a geologic <b>repository</b> dates back to 1957 when the National Academy of Sciences recommended that the best means of protecting the environment and public health and safety would be to dispose of the waste in rock deep underground.|$|E
