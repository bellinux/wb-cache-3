It emerged that a second race participant was also {{a possible}} case. An outbreak control team coordinated the epidemiological investigation, laboratory investigation, environmental assessment, communication and control measures. A cluster of six laboratory-confirmed cases of leptospirosis, serologically Leptospira interrogans serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae was found. The attack rate was 9. 2 % (6 / 65). Fever, chills, <b>red</b> eyes and <b>shortness</b> of breath {{were significantly associated with}} being a confirmed case. Five cases were hospitalized. Swallowing more than one mouthful of water was associated with an increased risk of developing leptospirosis. Increased rainfall and release of hydroelectric water may have contributed to this outbreak. A multidisciplinary approach and use of the Internet and e-mail facilitated rapid and effective communication...|$|R
