He collected Brooke Bond tea cards about space, owned {{a telescope}} {{and wanted to}} be an astronomer but lacked the necessary mathematical skills. He developed an interest in reading science fiction and began attending science fiction conventions from about 1963–1964, but stopped when he got his first job a few years later. His early reading included the works of H. G.

500|$|Even {{once the}} {{agreement}} between the states of New Jersey, New York, and the Port Authority was finalized, the World Trade Center plan faced continued controversy. [...] The site for the World Trade Center was the location of Radio Row, which was home to hundreds of commercial and industrial tenants, property owners, small businesses, and approximately 100 residents. [...] The World Trade Center plans involved evicting these business owners, some of whom fiercely protested the forced relocation. [...] In June 1962, a group representing approximately 325 shops and 1,000 other affected small businesses filed an injunction, challenging the Port Authority's power of eminent domain. [...] The dispute with local business owners worked {{its way through the}} court system, up to the New York State Court of Appeals, which in April 1963 upheld the Port Authority's right of eminent domain, saying that the project had a [...] "public purpose." [...] On November 12, 1963, the United States Supreme Court refused to accept the case. Under the state law, the Port Authority was required to assist business owners in relocating, though many business owners regarded what the Port Authority offered as inadequate. Questions continued while the World Trade Center was constructed, as to whether the Port Authority <b>really</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> take on the project, described by some as a [...] "mistaken social priority." ...|$|E

I was inhumanly {{tormented by}} a quadrille band which the proprietors of St James's Hall (who <b>really</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be {{examined}} by two doctors) had stationed within earshot of the concert-hall. The heavy tum-tum of the basses throbbed obscurely against {{the rhythms of}} Spohr and Berlioz all the evening, like a toothache through a troubled dream; and occasionally, during a pianissimo, or in one of Lady Hallé's eloquent pauses, the cornet would burst into vulgar melody in a remote key, and set us all flinching, squirming, shuddering, and grimacing hideously.' ...|$|E

We ought to say, 'It’s not a war anymore,' or we <b>really</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> go after it. And {{there was a time}} in our history when we weren’t always losing the war on drugs.

[...] According to law professor Michael Stokes Paulson, [...] "Among the most common canards in critiques of originalism is that, under the original meaning of the Constitution, the issuance of paper money as legal tender would be unconstitutional, sending our economy into disarray." ...|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{interpreted}} God's {{instructions to}} Moses and Aaron in [...] "and to Pharaoh, King of Egypt," [...] to convey that God told Moses and Aaron that although God <b>really</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> punish Pharaoh, God wanted Moses and Aaron to show Pharaoh the respect {{due to his}} regal position.

2500|$|Saturday Review said of Advise and Consent in August 1959 that [...] "It {{may be a}} {{long time}} before a better one comes along." [...] Roger Kaplan of Policy Review wrote in 1999 that the novel [...] "in many ways invented a genre in fiction…. The use of a racy intrigue, if {{possible}} involving both sex and foreign policy, is what characterizes the contemporary form. Forty years on, Advise and Consent is the only book of this genre that a literary-minded person <b>really</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> read." [...] Richard L. Neuberger reviewed the novel for The New York Times in 1959, writing that [...] "rarely has a political tale been told with such vivid realism" [...] and calling the book [...] "one of the finest and most gripping political novels of our era." [...] Conversely, Pamela Hansford Johnson of the New Statesman called Advise and Consent [...] "politically repellent and artistically null with a steady hysterical undertone." ...|$|E

2500|$|Victor Seastrom, a {{respected}} Swedish director at MGM, {{was a good}} friend of Stiller and encouraged Mayer to meet him on a trip to Berlin. There are two recent versions of what happened next. In one, Mayer, always looking for new talent, had done his research and was interested in Stiller. He made an offer but Stiller demanded that Garbo be part of any contract, convinced that she would be an asset to his career. Mayer balked, but eventually agreed to a private viewing of Gösta Berling. He was immediately struck by Garbo's magnetism and became more interested in her than in Stiller. [...] "It was her eyes," [...] his daughter recalled him saying, [...] "I can make a star out of her." [...] In the second version, Mayer had already seen Gösta Berling before his Berlin trip, and Garbo, not Stiller, was his primary interest. On the way to the screening, Mayer said to his daughter [...] "This director is wonderful, but what we <b>really</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> look at is the girl… The girl, look at the girl!" [...] After the screening, his daughter reported, he was unwavering: [...] "I'll take her without him. I'll take her with him. Number one is the girl." ...|$|E
