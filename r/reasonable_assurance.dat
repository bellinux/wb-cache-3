40|$|A Satellite Operational Procedure (OP) {{consists}} {{of a set of}} instructions reading information from the satel-lite (telemetries, TM) and sending commands to it (telecommands, TC). An OP can be executed by a human or by a computer (on-board procedures). Typically OPs are mission critical systems since their failure may entail hardware damages, degradation of satellite services or costly human based recovery actions. For this reason OPs are typically thoroughly tested in order to have <b>reasonable</b> <b>assurances</b> about their correctness. Unfor-tunately, traditional simulation based verification of OPs is highly expensive, since it requires a high amount of time from highly skilled personnel and does not provide formal assurance about the correctness of the OP under verification. We show how a model checker (CMurphi) can be used to drive a satellite simulator (namely, SIMSAT). The proposed approach has the following benefits. First, it improves OP quality assurance by automatic exhaustive exploration of all possible simulation scenarios whereas a manually driven simulation campaign cannot offer any formal assurance on the coverage achieved by the simulation campaign. Second, it decreases OP verifi-cation costs by using a model checker to automatically drive (via fault injections) the simulator. The model checker will record the considered simulation scenarios and automatically generate fresh (i. e., not previously considered) scenarios automatically stopping when all meaningful scenarios have been considered. Third, our approach allows humans to focus on the design of disturbance models (e. g., how many faults it makes sense to consider, when such faults may occur, etc.) which are highly reusable across verification of similar OPs. We implemented a prototype system by interfacing the CMurphi model checker to the SIMSAT simulator. Our experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed approach. I...|$|R
40|$|American taxpayers {{spend more}} than $ 100 billion per year on federal {{construction}} projects. Yet massive construction delays, huge budget overruns, and unorganized contractors increase the cost of construction for the federal government. Passed in 1935, the Miller Act attempted to protect {{the federal government in}} the event that the contractor defaulted or was unable to complete the project. By requiring contractors to enlist third party “sureties” as guarantors on projects, the Miller Act provides the government with the assurance that another party will step in to complete projects if need be. Contractors are typically paid via periodic progress payments, with monthly invoices paid for work completed. If a contractor defaults, forcing a surety to take over on the project, the doctrine of equitable subrogation entitles the surety to all remaining progress payments due to the contractor. Fearing that default may be imminent and eager to receive any payments it can, a surety may be inclined to warn the federal government of imminent contractor default, {{at the same time that}} the contractor assures the federal government that it can perform. A series of Federal Circuit cases allows the surety to sue the federal government to recover progress payments that were already made to the contractor, even though those payments were made prior to the contractor defaulting, in accordance with federal regulations. Given an opportunity to reduce this risk of double payment, the Federal Circuit instead created an incoherent and unworkable progress-payment framework in Balboa Insurance Co. v. United States, complicating a government official’s regulatory mandate to provide progress payments to contractors. The court misinterpreted a standard that is normally extremely deferential to the federal government, and created a complex eight-factor behemoth that unreasonably burdens the federal government. This Note proposes new regulations to replace Balboa, which focuses on whether the federal government received <b>reasonable</b> <b>assurances</b> from the contractor that it would complete performance...|$|R

40|$|In this dissertation, we {{describe}} avoidance routing. Avoidance routing is a mechanism that provides users control over how their data transits the Internet. Currently, a user may use cryptography to provide confidentially for their data, {{but has no}} control over who can observe or access their data. Avoidance routing provides this control by having users specify properties of routers they do not trust, such as geopolitical location. A path to the destination that does not transit routers with the given properties is found, on-demand, with <b>reasonable</b> <b>assurances</b> that the path found does not contain untrusted routers. Avoidance routing accomplishes this by augmenting BGP with a security vector. This vector contains the properties of each router along the given AS path. Given this vector and a users criteria, avoidance routing conducts a depth-first search to find a valid path the destination. We leverage the information contained within BGP {{to try and find}} this path quickly and optimally. Our results show that avoidance routing tends to find short paths, on average 7 hops longer than the standard path in the worst case. Further, less than 1 % of nodes on the Internet are visited, and only 5 % in the worst case. The storage space required to store the augmented advertisements or conduct the search is both reasonable and small. Finally, their is no performance impact in terms of packet forwarding by using avoidance routing. We will discuss our use of a consensus mechanism to provide protection of routing information. This mechanism treats each neighbor of a node as a consensus speaker or "voter". These speakers will each make claims about their neighbor, and the consensus approach will attempt to determine the validity of these claims as well as the quality of each speaker. When routing, only nodes with high agreement on their claims will be used, as well as only speakers with high quality. Our results show that our consensus mechanism, while simple, also provides reasonable security guarantees...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} a very topical issue, {{under the}} conditions of the economic crisis, on the going concern of an entity {{and the manner in which}} the auditor can provide <b>reasonable</b> <b>assurances</b> to that effect. The going concern assumption is a fundamental principle for drafting the financial statements, which state that an entity is generally regarded as presenting a continuation of its work in the foreseeable future, having no intention or need to be liquidated, and to suspend its activity or to seek protection from creditors. The keywords of the success of an audit mission will consider the consolidation of the credibility of accounting information, along with early detection of some possible risks which the entity may expose to in the future. Raising the issue on following-up the activity in a public manner means already bringing a prejudice to the entity. Thus, in a field such as accounting, announcing the result of the current year as being lower compared to the result of the previous year already represents the priming of the vicious circle of losing the confidence. The events or conditions that could significantly question the reporting entity's ability to continue work can be identified during the execution of the risk assessment procedures or during the execution of further audit procedures. The auditor assesses the effect of the identified events or conditions when assessing the significant distortion risks, and, therefore, their existence may affect the nature, type and extent of the auditor's further procedures. For the more rigorous assessment of abiding the principle of future business, the financial auditor will examine the dynamics of liquidity, solvency, equilibrium and financial performance indicators, and to evaluate the risk of bankruptcy by the score method. To interpret the results, the professional reasoning, experience and comparative data of the activity field of the similar entities are essential. audit, going concern, financial statements, examination, risk of bankruptcy. ...|$|R

The effect of the treaty would be in a manner secured before the detail of particulars was begun, and for a plain reason,--because the hostile spirit on both sides had been conjured down; but if, in the full fury and unappeased rancor of war, a little traffic is attempted, it is easy to divine what must be the consequence to those who endeavor to open that kind of petty commerce.|$|E

40|$|While {{non-financial}} reporting {{has been}} gaining momentum, there is limited research which addresses {{the impact of the}} credibility-enhancing mechanisms for such non-financial reports. This thesis is motivated by the need to investigate the impact of independent assurance and one of its alternative credibility-enhancing mechanisms, combined assurance, on investors’ judgments. Study One examines whether independent assurance and different assurance levels on the CSR information makes a difference to the firm’s valuation of non-professional investors, and whether there is an interaction with explicit assessment (previous research has shown that CSR information can elicit affective reactions which subsequently influence investors’ judgments, and a prompt to explicitly assess CSR information can mitigate such impact). Study Two examines whether combined assurance influences investors’ fundamental value estimates. It also examines whether limited and combined assurance together will result in a greater impact. Both studies use an experimental approach with post-graduate students serving as proxies for non-professional investors. Study One finds that independent <b>assurance</b> (both <b>reasonable</b> and limited <b>assurance)</b> has a significant role in enhancing the reliability of CSR information and influencing fundamental value estimates. Also, investors who receive and perceive the CSR information to be assured at a reasonable level estimate higher fundamental values than the investors who receive and perceive the CSR information to be not assured or assured at a limited level. Furthermore, the impact of CSR information in eliciting affective reactions which lead to higher fundamental value estimates is significant only when the CSR information is assured at a <b>reasonable</b> level. Combined <b>assurance</b> is proposed as a complementary or alternative mechanism to independent assurance. While Study Two finds that limited assurance has a significant role in enhancing the reliability of CSR information, it does not find evidence of the impact of either limited or combined assurance on the judgments and decision making of non-professional investors. These findings have important implications for the reporting entities and regulators about the benefits of independent assurance and combined assurance...|$|R
