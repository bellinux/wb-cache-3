5|$|Tim Webber of VFX house Framestore CFC was {{responsible}} for the three-and-a-half minute single take of Kee giving birth, helping to choreograph and create the CG effects of the childbirth. Cuarón had originally intended to use an animatronic baby as Kee's child {{with the exception of the}} childbirth scene. In the end, two takes were shot, with the second take concealing Clare-Hope Ashitey's legs, <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> with prosthetic legs. Cuarón was pleased with the results of the effect, and returned to previous shots of the baby in animatronic form, <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> with Framestore's computer-generated baby.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of these problems, in 1954 serious {{consideration}} was given to scrapping the class and <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> with Britannia class locomotives. However, the locomotives had excellent boilers and several other good features and so the decision was taken to rebuild them, removing several of Bulleid's less successful ideas.|$|E

5|$|Burger King and McDonald's {{opened on}} the Pennsylvania Turnpike in 1983. This marked a {{transition}} from sit-down to fast-food dining on the turnpike by popular demand. The Marriott Corporation purchased the remaining Howard Johnson's restaurants in 1987, incorporating it into its Host Marriott division and <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> with restaurants such as Roy Rogers and Bob's Big Boy.|$|E

The $24 billion saved in funding could be used on other programs.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} opening {{took place on}} 19 November 1927 by King Haakon VII. When the line opened there were 21 manned station on the line. Up to 70 people worked on the line, in addition to station employees. In 1932, the operations were rationalized, cutting costs from NOK426,000 to NOK310,000 per year. This involved removing the station masters at fifteen stations and <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> with a clerk.|$|E

5|$|This {{two-tier system}} of local {{government}} lasted until 1996 when the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 came into effect, abolishing the regions and districts and <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> with 32 unitary authorities.

5|$|A roadway has {{connected}} Benton City to Richland {{since at}} least 1926, while a road with an alignment more {{similar to that of}} the current highway first appeared on maps in 1939, with termini at the concurrent highways U.S. Route 410 and PSH3. The highway now known as SR224 was numbered Secondary State Highway 3R (SSH3R) between 1937 and the 1964 state highway renumbering, which abolished the Primary and Secondary highway numbers, <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> with Sign Route numbers, later renamed State Routes.|$|E

5|$|In 1882, the team's decline continued, and the {{pitchers}} began to complain of exhaustion and accused management of overuse. A second consecutive last-place finish, along with declining talent, their fans stopped attending home games, with attendance numbers averaging 50 paid spectators. John Clarkson, {{who went on}} to win 328 games in a 12-season career, and was the only Hall of Famer to have played for the franchise, began his career for the 1881 Ruby Legs. When the season ended, the NL decided to drop the team from the league, <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> with the Philadelphia Quakers, who later became the Phillies.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 {{the station}} {{underwent}} a major modernisation, removing the murals {{installed on the}} Central and Bakerloo line platforms in the 1980s and <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> with plain white tiles, in a style {{similar to those used}} when the station opened in 1900. One 1980s mural remains on one of the platforms. The Central line platform works were substantially complete and a new Station Operations Room at top level opened. This enabled the entire CCTV system to be switched over to new recordable digital technology. The original motifs designed by Hans Unger on the Victoria line platforms were restored.|$|E
5|$|In February 1854, the General Assembly's Whig {{majority}} gerrymandered the Eighth District, removing {{over 500}} Democratic voters and <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> with several hundred Whig voters by removing Owen and Jessamine counties {{from the district}} and adding Harrison and Nicholas counties to it. The cooperation of the Know Nothing Party—a relatively new nativist political entity—with the faltering Whigs further hindered Breckinridge's re-election chances. With his family again in financial straits, his wife wanted him to retire from national politics.|$|E

5|$|Matthias visited Slavonia and {{dismissed}} the two Bans Nicholas Újlaki and Emeric Zápolya, <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> with Jan Vitovec and John Tuz in 1466. Early the following year, he mounted a campaign in Upper Hungary against {{a band of}} Czech mercenaries who were {{under the command of}} Ján Švehla and had seized Kosztolány (now Veľké Kostoľany in Slovakia). Matthias routed them and had Švehla and his 150 comrades hanged.|$|E
5|$|Under Section 16, the Act {{applies to}} {{servants}} of the crown, while Section 17 repeals all previous common law and statutory offences relating to bribery, <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> with {{provisions of the}} Act. Section 18 provides that the Act applies to England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland; while the separate consent of the Scottish Parliament is usually required in such cases, as is made clear in Section 19, a Legislative Consent Motion was passed on 11 February 2010, allowing {{for the application of}} the Act within Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the turn}} of the millennium, the airline renewed its aging fleet, {{retiring}} several of its S-61 and 206 helicopters and <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> with Bell 212s and Eurocopter AS350s. The company also sacked its CEO Peter Fich, who had proven unable to balance Greenland Home Rule's demands for local Greenlander service with the board's for expanded tourism, lower fares and higher profits. Under his replacement Finn Øelund, Grønlandsfly initially posted a DKK 30 million loss as contractual obligations maintained unprofitable service while a strike ruined the summer tourist season and Post Greenland moved a lucrative mail contract to the Danish-owned Air Alpha Greenland. In response, the company successfully pushed back against Greenland Home Rule's large demands, high fees and low subsidies and rebranded itself, anglicising its name to Air Greenland and adopting a new logo and livery on 18 April 2002.|$|E

5|$|As {{the houses}} in the Ghetto age, and {{as the number of}} {{students}} wishing to live in the Ghetto expands, the university has begun a renovation and replacement program with the goal of keeping the current feel of the area intact. In 2000, construction began on several new duplexes to fill land that was unused, resulting in housing for several dozen additional students. The duplexes housed six students per side, for a total of 12 students each. In 2003, the university continued the project by tearing down several houses on Stonemill Road and <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> with a new five-person design. Several more of these houses have now been built throughout the Ghetto.|$|E
5|$|Barrowclough's {{opportunity}} {{for a return to}} duty overseas came following the death of Mead in an aircraft crash in July 1942. At the time of Mead's death, the Pacific Section was being recalled to New Zealand for reorganisation into a division for offensive operations in the South Pacific. In August, Barrowclough was named as commander of what was now known as the 3rd New Zealand Division. He immediately overhauled its structure and removed many officers who he considered too old for frontline duty, <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> with personnel who had experience with the 2NZEF in Greece, Crete or North Africa. He also implemented training programs for his new command; most of its personnel had been engaged in the construction of fortifications while in Fiji, which had left little {{opportunity for}} intensive tactical training and exercises.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth's {{plan to have}} Mary {{married to}} Louis of France divided the court. The Lackfis, {{the master of the}} {{treasury}} Nicholas Zámbó and the judge royal Nicholas Szécsi openly opposed it and renounced their allegiance to the queen dowager in August, which resulted in her depriving them of all their offices and <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> with Garai's partisans. The kingdom {{was on the verge of}} a civil war when Charles decided to invade, encouraged by John Horvat and his brother Paul, Bishop of Zagreb. Charles' imminent arrival forced Elizabeth to yield and abandon the idea of French marriage. While her envoys in Paris were preparing for Louis's journey, Elizabeth came to terms with her opponents and designated Szécsi as the new palatine.|$|E
