5|$|In the free-electron laser (FEL), a {{relativistic}} {{electron beam}} passes through a pair of undulators that contain arrays of dipole magnets whose fields point in alternating directions. The electrons emit synchrotron radiation that coherently interacts with the same electrons to strongly amplify the radiation field at the <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency.</b> FEL can emit a coherent high-brilliance electromagnetic radiation {{with a wide range}} of frequencies, from microwaves to soft X-rays. These devices are used in manufacturing, communication, and in medical applications, such as soft tissue surgery.|$|E
5|$|Another way {{to measure}} {{the speed of light}} is to {{independently}} measure the frequency f and wavelength λ of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value of c can then be found by using the relation c=fλ. One option is to measure the <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> of a cavity resonator. If the dimensions of the resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine the wavelength of the wave. In 1946, Louis Essen and A.C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety of normal modes of microwaves of a microwave cavity of precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry. As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light.|$|E

5|$|The {{mechanism}} may be internal to the Earth system. The Earth's {{climate system}} {{may have a}} natural <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> of 100ka; that is to say, feedback processes within the climate automatically produce a 100ka effect, much as a bell naturally rings at a certain pitch. Opponents to this claim {{point out that the}} resonance would have to have developed 1 million years ago, as a 100ka periodicity was weak to non-existent for the preceding 2million years. This is feasible—continental drift and sea floor spreading rate change have been postulated as possible causes of such a change. Free oscillations of components of the Earth system have been considered as a cause, but too few Earth systems have a thermal inertia on a thousand-year timescale for any long-term changes to accumulate. The most common hypothesis looks to the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, which might expand through a few shorter cycles until large enough to undergo a sudden collapse. The 100,000-year problem has been scrutinized by José A. Rial, Jeseung Oh and Elizabeth Reischmann who find that master-slave synchronization between the climate systems natural frequencies and the eccentricity forcing started the 100 ky ice ages of the late Pleistocene and explain their large amplitude.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Free-vibration-resonance {{frequencies}} of a film/substrate layered specimen {{depend on the}} dimensions, densities, and elastic constants both of the film and substrate. Then, the elastic constants of thin films are inversely determined by measuring the <b>resonance</b> <b>frequencies</b> and the other parameters. Because contributions of the film elastic constants to the <b>resonance</b> <b>frequencies</b> are small, high accurate measurement of <b>resonance</b> <b>frequencies</b> is indispensable. In this study, we develop a piezoelectric tripod transducer, which enables one to measure the <b>resonance</b> <b>frequencies</b> with an accuracy better than 10 - 4. In the inverse calculation, mode identification for measured <b>resonance</b> <b>frequencies</b> is the key issue. We achieve this by measuring the surfacedisplacement distributions using laser-Doppler interferometory. We applied the proposed method to a thin film of chemical-vapor-deposition diamond. Measured elastic constants are smaller than those of bulk diamond. We attribute the compliant diamond thin film to local incohesive bonds at grain boundaries. Introduction: Accurate elastic constants of thin films are indispensable to designing and stress analysis of devices. Many studies have clarified elastic properties of bulk materials. However, those of thin films are not well known {{because of the difficulty}} of measurements. Thin films ar...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} {{resonant}} acoustic spectroscopy was applied during static {{loading and unloading}} of three prestressed concrete beams {{in the context of}} acoustoelasticity. At each load step multiple modes of vibration were measured using an accelerometer and a small impact source. It was found that the measured <b>resonance</b> <b>frequencies</b> increased with increasing compressive stress in a manner which can be predicted using a non-linear finite element model based on Murnaghan's third order elastic theory. Previous results from experimental studies on concrete bridges indicate that measured structural <b>resonance</b> <b>frequencies</b> increase with increasing prestress forces. These results have been difficult to explain theoretically and the results from this study can possibly provide a new theoretical basis for the observed stress dependency of the <b>resonance</b> <b>frequencies</b> of concrete structures.
