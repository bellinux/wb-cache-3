50|$|The aerodrome {{is owned}} by the local {{government}} and used for pioneer flight operations. The coordinates are 00 47 North, 114 34 East. The elevation is not officially published, only measured from the aircraft altimeter, which is about 650 ft above sea level. The runway designation is 02 and 20. The length of the runway is 750 meter with width of 23 meter. A stopway of 30 meter is provided for runway 02. The runway surface is asphalt and its strength can accommodate up to CASA 212 aircraft. It has an apron, taxiway, but a tower building is not available since the aerodrome is a non controlled aerodrome. The runway is not equipped with landing direction indicators and, due to local prevailing surface winds at most of the time, the preferred takeoff and landing direction is runway 02. A significant obstacle is the hilly forest in the northerly direction of the extension of runway 02. The first obstacle is about 200 feet high above runway elevation located about 533.3 meters from the end of runway 02, and the second obstacle is about 500 feet above runway elevation 1.262,9 meters from the end of runway 02. <b>Runway</b> <b>slope</b> inclination is 3% from direction of runway 02.|$|E
40|$|The fuel {{consumption}} of two tandem trucks is recorded for truck spacings of 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 meters. The trucks are linked {{by means of}} an electronic control system, and are operated on an unused runway at Crows Landing, California. Fuel consumption data is averaged while traveling in both directions over the same central strip of runway to cancel the effect of <b>runway</b> <b>slope</b> and to partially cancel the effect of wind. The average {{fuel consumption}} saving to be achieved by tandem operation varies from about 11 % at 3 - 4 meters spacing to about 8 % at 8 - 10 meters spacing. ...|$|E

50|$|Bad {{weather is}} {{frequent}} in Southern Greenland, and Narsarsuaq is virtually surrounded by high mountains, making {{the approach to}} the steel-mat runway exceedingly difficult. The usual approach was a low-level flight up a fjord.

40|$|Transport-category or FAR/CS 25 {{certified}} airplanes may occasionally become {{braking energy}} capacity limited. Such limitation may exist when heavy airplanes are departing airports at high-density altitudes, on relatively long runways, and/or possibly with some tailwind component. A {{maximum braking energy}} VMBE speed exists which may limit the maximum allowable takeoff decision/action speed V 1. The ever-existing possibility of high-speed rejected takeoff in such conditions may also limit the airplane gross weight for declared available distances. To gain deeper insights and acquire {{better understanding of the}} topic, a theoretical model of the maximum braking energy and the related VMBE speed for T-category airplanes was developed. The total kinetic energy of an airplane includes translational and rotary kinetic energy and the potential height-energy component for sloped runways. Time-dependent airplanesâ€™ mechanical power expression has been derived. Weight transfer during dynamic braking has been implemented in the full nonlinear model. Added mass due to rotary inertia of spinning components has been incorporated and assumed constant. The brakes thermal model is based on a lumped-parameter analysis of ventilated brake rotors and stators; the thermal model is based on a small Biot-number approximation and sufficiently well describes the physics of friction braking. The nonlinear differential equations of motion and the differential thermal model are coupled. A nonlinear model incorporating a set of ordinary differential equations with tire slip can be solved numerically. This model enables determination of the entire history of translational and angular accelerations and speeds, longitudinal distance, forces, torque, and disc temperature during braking. A simpler model assuming constant physical and thermodynamic parameters is solved analytically for constant negative acceleration. This linear analytical model {{has been used as a}} workhorse method in our calculations. A new semi-empirical expression of temperature-dependent friction coefficient on brake rotor-stator pairs has been proposed. A theoretical model of maximum braking energy speed VMBE, which includes density-altitude, <b>runway</b> <b>slope,</b> and wind effects as parameters, has been developed for the first time to the best of our knowledge. A comparison of the theoretical VMBE model showed good agreement with measured and approved data for the B 737 - 400 airplane at different density altitudes with and without, individual and combined, <b>runway</b> <b>slope</b> and tailwind effects. Results for new and fully worn brakes were obtained showing the effect of elevated temperatures on brake fade and consequently braking time and distance...|$|E
40|$|A design {{approach}} for an aircraft takeoff performance monitoring system (TOPMS) is described. In this approach, it is {{proposed that the}} Global Positioning System (GPS) {{in conjunction with a}} discrete Kalman Filter be used to determine aircraft acceleration, ground speed, and position relative {{to the end of the}} runway. A practical evaluation of the feasibility of this proposal showed clear superiority of a GPS-derived acceleration over a more traditional method employing accelerometers. This study found that, when compared to observations from carefully mounted accelerometers, the GPS-derived observation agreed to within 0. 10 metres per second squared ninety percent of the time. Advantages of the GPS-derived observation included a modest noise level, insusceptibility to gravity and temperature-influenced variations, and far simplified mounting criteria. A theoretical dynamic model of an aircraft in contact with the ground was developed in consideration of factors pertaining to runways at far-northern Canadian airports. In the model, factors such as <b>runway</b> <b>slope,</b> wind velocity, wheel friction coefficient, and aircraft control settings were considered constant. While variability in any parameter considered constant by the model could influence the performance of a TOPMS, such variability was deemed beyond the scope of this preliminary investigation of a TOPMS designed specifically for the far-northern environment. A device containing a GPS receiver and data acquisition system was designed and certified, then installed in an aircraft operated by an airline servicing far-northern Canadian airports. The data collected in this manner were used to validate the theoretical model. It was concluded that a projection of displacement can be determined to within an uncertainty of fifteen metres in sufficient time to alert the pilot of an unsafe situation...|$|E
40|$|Modern geomatic {{techniques}} can provide useful methods to inquiry airport areas, not only runways and parking areas, but also surrounding areas including obstacles. It {{is essential to}} have an updated DTM (Digital Terrain Model) of the entire airport area for viewing and creating a land registry of aeronautical obstacles {{in order to proceed}} to the design of flight plans. By means of georeferenced stereo pairs of high resolution satellite images it is possible to build DTM on wide areas. For high traffic load airports, runways, taxiways and aprons maintenance is a critical task. A Pavement Management System requires periodic monitoring activities to control structural and geometrical characteristics, with the aim of ensuring the infrastructure functionality. Surface regularity, <b>runway</b> <b>slope,</b> plates planarity and reciprocal asset, are among the most relevant parameters, on which has been investigated in this note. A very high level of accuracy is required and {{it has been shown that}} the TLS (Terrestrial Laser Scanner) is a very precise and efficient tool. The note summarizes the results of the processing of both high resolution satellite images (acquired on Trinidad and Tobago airport area) and of data acquired by TLS on the pavement of an international airport. Four Pleiades stereo pairs, with 0. 5 m spatial resolution, have been georeferenced by GPS and processed to produce a grid DEM (1 m step) Scans obtained by TLS on a runway segment have been co-registered and georeferenced. From the point clouds, a very dense DTM has been obtained, which allowed the extraction of longitudinal and transversal profiles. The linear fit of the profiles produces the gradients, which were compared with the required standards. On the same airport, a concrete apron was surveyed by TLS. Surveys allowed checking plates deformation and their reciprocal asset...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} compare the muscle {{activities}} of the lower limb during overground level running (LR) and uphill running(UR) by using a musculoskeletal model. Six male distance runners ran at three running speeds (slow: 3. 3 m/s; medium: 4. 2 m/s; and high: 5. 0 m/s) on a level <b>runway</b> and a <b>slope</b> of 9. 1 % grade in which force platforms were mounted. A musculoskeletal leg model andoptimization were used to estimate the muscle activation and muscle torque from the joint torque of the lower limb calculated by theinverse dynamics approach. At high speed, the activation and muscle torque of the muscle groups surrounding the hip joints, such asthe hamstrings and iliopsoas, during the recovery phase were significantly greater during UR than during LR. At all the runningspeeds, the knee extension torque by the vasti during the support phase was significantly smaller during UR. Further, the hip flexion andknee extension torques by the rectus femoris during UR were significantly greater than those during LR at all the speeds; this would playa role in compensating for the decrease in the knee extension torque by the vasti and in maintaining the trunk in a forward-leaningposition. These results revealed that the activation and muscle torque of the hip extensors and flexors were augmented during UR atthe high speed...|$|R
40|$|Flat flaps that enclose {{the trailer}} {{base on the}} sides and top are known to reduce truck drag and reduce fuel consumption. Such flapped-truck {{geometries}} have been studied in laboratory wind tunnels and in field tests. A recent review of wind tunnel data {{for a variety of}} truck geometries and flow Reynolds numbers show roughly similar values of peak drag reduction, but differ in the determination of the optimum flap angle. Optimum angles lie in the range 12 degrees- 20 degrees, and may be sensitive to Reynolds number and truck geometry. The present field test is undertaken to provide additional estimates of the magnitude of the savings to be expected on a typical truck for five flap angles 10, 13, 16, 19, and 22 degrees. The flaps are constructed from a fiberglass-epoxy-matrix material and are one-quarter of the base width in length (about 61 cm, or 2 feet). They are attached along the rear door hinge lines {{on either side of the}} trailer, so that no gap appears at the joint between the flap and the side of the trailer The flap angle is adjusted by means of two aluminum supports. The present test is performed on the NASA Crows Landing Flight Facility at the northern end of the San Joaquin valley in California. The main runway is approximately 2400 meters in length, and is aligned approximately in a north-south direction The test procedure is to make a series of runs starting at either end of the runway. All runs are initiated under computer control to accelerate the truck to a target speed of 60 mph (96 6 km/hr), to proceed at the target speed for a fixed distance, and to decelerate at the far end of the runway. During a run, the broadcast fuel rate, the engine rpm, forward speed, elapsed time [...] as well as several other parameters (10 in all) [...] are digitized at a rate of 100 digitizations per second. Various flapped-conditions are interspersed with the ''no flaps'' control, and are sequenced in a different order on different days. Approximately 310 runs are accumulated over the 5 -day test period, May 17 - 21, 2004. The <b>runway</b> <b>slopes</b> rather uniformly upward from north-to-south. Over the distance of 2424 meters between our two ''start'' markers at either end of the runway, the net change in elevation is a little over ten meters. Test results clearly show the greater fuel consumption required to lift the truck against gravity in the southbound direction For this reason, it is important that the tests be averaged over a round trip circuit [...] that is, a run in both directions over the identical portion of the roadway. Northbound-southbound averages require an overlap segment of the runway (near the middle of the runway) where the truck [...] starting from either end [...] has achieved its target speed. For the target truck speed of 60 mph, this overlap region is approximately 700 meters in length. Typically a run and the return run are accomplished within a time interval of 6 minutes. Analysis of the data show fuel consumption savings at all flap angle settings tested, when compared to the ''no flaps'' condition. The most beneficial flap angle appears to be 13 degrees, for which the fuel consumption is 0. 3778 {+-} 0. 0025 liters/km compared to the ''no flaps'' control of 0. 3941 {+-} 0. 0034 liters/km. The error bounds expressed above mark the 99 % confidence interval in the mean values given. That is, additional estimates of the mean fuel consumption would be expected to lie within the bounds given, approximately 99 % of the time. The fuel consumption saving is [...] to reasonable accuracy [...] about 1. 63 liters/ 100 kilometers. These savings represent the increment associated only with the change in drag due to the presence or absence of flaps. The result will hold for any truck of similar size and shape and engine performance regardless of the loading of the truck or the rolling resistance. The economy achieved by use of base flaps can be compared to the economy resulting from driving two trucks in a tandem configuration. In December 2003, such fuel consumption tests were performed at the same Crows Landing testsite. In the tests, two identical trucks are operated at headways in the range 3 - 10 meters. The trucks are steered by hand, but longitudinal control is provided by a closed-loop control system. Laser ranging measures truck-to-truck distance, and the control system maintains a truck separation to within about {+-} 3 centimeters. From these tests it is concluded that both trucks save fuel by close-following, that the fuel saving increases with decreasing spacing, and that the trail truck saves more fuel. An average value of fuel saving for each of the two trucks at spacings of 6 - 10 meters can be taken to be 3. 0 liters/ 100 km...|$|R
