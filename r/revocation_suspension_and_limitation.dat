The All India IAS Association, a national body of IAS officers, termed the government's actions [...] "wrong" [...] and believes that Nagpal was suspended due to her stringent actions which hurt the sand-mafia. It has demanded immediate <b>revocation</b> of her <b>suspension,</b> <b>and</b> called the incident [...] "demoralising" [...] for young IAS officers. The collective voicing of these concerns by the state's IAS officers was deemed unusual and surprised the ruling Samajwadi Party. Senior officers have attributed this backlash to the general feeling of discontentment in the officer cadre, which they say is due to increasing political interference in public administration.

40|$|In this paper, an {{integrated}} vehicle seat and sus pension control strategy {{for a quarter}} car with driver model is proposed to improve suspension performance on driver ride comfort. An integrated seat <b>and</b> <b>suspension</b> model that includes a quarter-car suspension, a seat <b>suspension,</b> <b>and</b> a 4 -degree-of freedom (DOM) driver body model is presented first. This in 1 tegrated model provides a platform to evaluate ride comfort 1 performance in terms of driver head acceleration responses under typical road disturbances and to develop {{an integrated}} control of seat <b>and</b> car <b>suspensions.</b> Based on the integrated model, an H∞ state feedback controller is designed to minimize the driver head acceleration under road disturbances. Considering that state variables for a driver body model are not measurement available in practice, a static output feedback controller, which only uses measurable state variables, is designed. Further discussion on robust multiobjective controller design, which considers driver body parameter uncertainties, <b>suspension</b> stroke <b>limitation,</b> <b>and</b> road-holding properties, is also provided. Last, numerical simula tions are conducted {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the proposed control strategy.

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{the study of}} robust active control of an integrated vehicle suspension system that consists of chassis <b>suspension,</b> seat <b>suspension,</b> <b>and</b> driver body models. This integrated system has five control inputs and ten control outputs and each control input may require different feedback signals and have different saturation limits. Taking the measurement available variables as feedback signals, an H∞ static output feedback controller is designed to improve vehicle ride comfort performance in terms of driver head acceleration under the constraints of actuator saturation, <b>suspension</b> deflection <b>limitation,</b> <b>and</b> road holding capability. The parameter uncertainties to the driver body are considered in the controller design procedure. The controller design conditions, which are expressed as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), are derived by dealing with each control input separately under a common Lyapunov function so that a feasible solution can be found. Furthermore, force tracking control strategy is applied to implement the proposed control system using electrohydraulic actuators. The improvement of ride comfort is evaluated by using numerical simulations on the driver head acceleration responses under a typical road disturbance...|$|R
40|$|In {{view of the}} {{performance}} requirements (e. g., ride comfort, road holding, <b>and</b> <b>suspension</b> space <b>limitation)</b> for vehicle suspension systems, this paper proposes an adaptive optimal control method for quarter-car active suspension system by using the approximate dynamic programming approach (ADP). Online optimal control law is obtained by using a single adaptive critic NN to approximate {{the solution of the}} Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Stability of the closed-loop system is proved by Lyapunov theory. Compared with the classic linear quadratic regulator (LQR) approach, the proposed ADP-based adaptive optimal control method demonstrates improved performance in the presence of parametric uncertainties (e. g., sprung mass) and unknown road displacement. Numerical simulation results of a sedan suspension system are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy...|$|R

40|$|The high {{efficiency}} with which gas microbubbles can scatter ultrasound {{compared to the}} surrounding blood pool or tissues has led to their widespread employment as contrast agents in ultrasound imaging. In recent years their application has seen expansion from purely imaging to include the development of localised bio-effects for therapeutic applications and as agents to achieve super-resolution imaging. The growing exploitation of contrast agents in ultrasound, and in particular these recent developments, have amplified the need to characterise and fully understand microbubble behaviour. The aim in doing so is to more fully exploit their utility for both diagnostic imaging and potential future therapeutic applications. This paper presents the key characteristics of microbubbles that determine their efficacy in diagnostic and therapeutic applications and the corresponding techniques for their measurement. In each case we have presented information regarding the methods available and their respective strengths <b>and</b> <b>limitations,</b> {{with the aim of}} presenting information relevant to the selection of appropriate characterisation methods. First we examine methods for determining the physical properties of microbubble <b>suspensions</b> <b>and</b> the various light-scattering approaches for achieving this, then techniques for acoustic characterisation, both for microbubble <b>suspensions</b> <b>and</b> single entities. Where microbubbles are intended for use as therapeutic agents, potentially also acting as drug cargo carriers, detailed understanding of their surface characteristics and drug loading capacity is required. Finally we will discuss the attempts which have been made to allow comparison across the methods employed by various groups to characterise and describe their microbubble <b>suspensions</b> <b>and</b> promote wider discussion and comparison of microbubble behaviour. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{biocontrol}} {{effects of}} Bacillus licheniformis W 10 bacterial <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> its antifungal protein on peach brown rot caused by Monilinia fructicola in storage peach fruits {{and the effects}} on fruit quality were investigated. The {{results showed that the}} fruit disease suppression of B. licheniformis W 10 bacterial <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> antifungal protein were significantly higher than that of the control. Inoculation of bacterial <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> antifungal protein prior to M. fructicola gave a better biocontrol effect, and the higher concentrations of bacterial (1 × 1010 cfu · mL− 1) and antifungal protein (3. 0 mg · mL− 1) performed better control effects. The environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity, affected biocontrol effects of W 10 bacterial <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> antifungal protein. The influence of environment conditions on the activity of antifungal protein was less than that on bacterial suspension. Moreover, lower temperature (4 °C) and relative humidity (RH 70 %– 75 %) were favorable to prevent peach brown rot by W 10 bacterial <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> its antifungal protein. The W 10 bacterial <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> antifungal protein amended with calcium [0. 1 % Ca(NO 3) 2] could enhance the biocontrol effects, and obviously put off the occurrence of peach brown rot. In addition, the bacterial <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> antifungal protein significantly reduced the natural decay rates of peach fruits during storage, and the effects were equal to carbendazim. Moreover, both W 10 bacterial <b>suspension</b> <b>and</b> antifungal protein treatments did not have effects on external and internal fruit appearance, such as chromatic aberration parameter L* of flesh, flesh firmness, soluble solids content and weight loss. Therefore, the B. licheniformis W 10 is a potential biocontrol factor for peach brown rot...|$|R
