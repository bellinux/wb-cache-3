5|$|After the {{revolution}} in Russia in 1917, the communist movement gradually gained footholds in many countries around the world. In Europe and the US, communist parties were formed, generally allied with trade union and labor causes. During the First Red Scare of 1919–1920, many Americans were fearful that Bolshevism and anarchism would lead to disruption within the US. In the late 1930s, state and federal legislatures passed laws designed to expose communists, including laws requiring loyalty oaths, and laws requiring communists to register with the government. Even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a free-speech advocacy organization, passed a <b>resolution</b> <b>in</b> 1939 expelling communists from its leadership ranks.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with other}} veterans' organisations, HIAG campaigned for the {{immediate}} amnesty and early release of war criminals still in Allied captivity. This issue was significant, as most of these organisations made their cooperation {{in the area of}} rearmament contingent on the satisfactory <b>resolution</b> <b>in</b> this area. It was partly for this reason that the West German government was sympathetic to the fate of these individuals and made every effort to secure their early release. Chancellor Adenauer even met with Kurt Meyer in Werl Prison when he went there on an inspection tour.|$|E
5|$|As a {{response}} to the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, Venizelos's power base was further strengthened, and on 8 October 1908 the Cretan Assembly passed a <b>resolution</b> <b>in</b> favor of union despite both the reservations of the Athens government under Georgios Theotokis and the objections of the Great Powers. The muted reaction of the Athens Government to the news from Crete led to an unsettled state of affairs on the mainland.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Solander {{was living}} in Linnaeus' house during his time as a student in Uppsala. Linnaeus was very fond of him, {{promising}} Solander his oldest daughter's hand in marriage. On Linnaeus' recommendation, Solander travelled to England in 1760, where he met the English botanist Joseph Banks. With Banks, Solander joined James Cook on his expedition to Oceania on the Endeavour in 1768–71. Solander {{was not the only}} apostle to journey with James Cook; Anders Sparrman followed on the <b>Resolution</b> <b>in</b> 1772–75 bound for, among other places, Oceania and South America. Sparrman made many other expeditions, one of them to South Africa.|$|E

5|$|Electron {{holography}} is an {{imaging technique}} that photographically records the electron interference pattern of an object, {{which is then}} reconstructed to yield a greatly magnified image of the original object. This technique was developed to enable greater <b>resolution</b> <b>in</b> electron microscopy than is possible using conventional imaging techniques. The resolution of conventional electron microscopy is not limited by electron wavelength, but by the large aberrations of electron lenses.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational metric systems use the {{kilogram-force}} (kilopond) as a {{base unit}} of force, with mass measured in a unit known as the hyl, Technische Mass Einheit (TME), mug or metric slug. Although the CGPM passed a <b>resolution</b> <b>in</b> 1901 defining the standard value of acceleration due to gravity to be 980.665cm/s2, gravitational units {{are not part of}} the International System of Units (SI).|$|E
5|$|Halo 3 {{does not}} {{natively}} render at true HD resolution (at least 720 lines of vertical <b>resolution).</b> <b>In</b> a Bungie Weekly Update, it was {{confirmed that the}} game renders at 1152×640 resolution instead of the usual 1280×720 (HD) resolution that most Xbox 360 games use. This is because Halo 3 uses two frame buffers instead of the usual one, so the lower resolution allowed Bungie to preserve as much of the dynamic range as possible for the game's lighting without adversely affecting the frame rate. The image can be upscaled to 1080p by the Xbox 360.|$|E

5|$|India's Foreign Policy {{has also}} {{to some degree}} been {{influenced}} by the DPSPs. India, in the past has condemned all acts of aggression and has also supported the United Nations' peace-keeping activities. By 2004, the Indian Army had participated in 37 UN peace-keeping operations. India {{played a key role in}} the passing of a UN <b>resolution</b> <b>in</b> 2003, which envisaged better co-operation between the Security Council and the troop-contributing countries.

Landman also printed many opinions against the resolution and Zionism in his American Hebrew Magazine.

5|$|The US {{delegation}} later {{contacted the}} Soviet delegation {{and sent a}} message requesting that the Kremlin use its influence over North Korea to compel it {{to comply with the}} resolution, but the Soviet Union denied the request. With the ineffectiveness of the <b>resolution</b> <b>in</b> de-escalating the conflict, the UNSC convened on June 27 to discuss further actions to take, resulting in United Nations Security Council Resolution 83, which recommended military intervention by other UN member nations to restore peace in Korea. Within days, ships and aircraft from several nations, as well as the first major formations of US troops, were moving to South Korea, setting the stage for a full-scale conflict.|$|E
