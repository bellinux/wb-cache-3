5|$|On lap 43 of the race, Bianchi {{lost control}} {{of his car and}} veered right towards the run-off area {{on the outside of the}} Dunlop Curve (turn seven) of the Suzuka Circuit. He {{collided}} with the rear of a tractor crane tending to the removal of Adrian Sutil's Sauber after Sutil had spun out of control and crashed in the same area a lap before. Spectators' video footage and photographs of the accident revealed that the left side of Bianchi's Marussia car was extensively damaged and the <b>roll</b> <b>bar</b> destroyed as it slid under the tractor crane. The impact was such that the tractor crane was partially jolted off the ground causing Sutil's Sauber, which was suspended in the air by the crane, to fall back to the ground. The race was stopped and Lewis Hamilton was declared the winner.|$|E
5|$|Bianchi {{collided}} with {{the rear of the}} tractor crane, which caused extensive damage to his car; its <b>roll</b> <b>bar</b> was destroyed as it slid underneath. The impact jolted the tractor crane off the ground, causing Sutil's car (suspended in the air by the crane) to fall to the ground. Marshals moved away from the scene to avoid being struck by Bianchi's Marussia. Calculations in July 2015 indicated a peak of 254 g0 (2,490m/s2), and data from the FIA's World Accident Database—which sources information from racing accidents worldwide—indicate that Bianchi's impact occurred 2.61 seconds after loss of control, at a speed of 123km/h (76mph) and an angle of 55 degrees. Bianchi was reported unconscious after not responding to a team radio call or marshals. Marshals reported the accident, and safety and medical cars were dispatched. Bianchi was extracted from his car and treated at the crash site before being taken by ambulance to the circuit's medical centre. Transport by helicopter was impossible due to the weather; Bianchi was taken by ambulance with a police escort to Mie Prefectural General Medical Center in Yokkaichi, about 15km (9.3mi, a 32-minute drive) from the track.|$|E
25|$|Equipped almost identically to CSX2522, {{this second}} example had {{aluminum}} valve covers, a tuned air cleaner, a Smiths heater, seat belts, {{front and rear}} brake cooling ducts, a hood scoop, brake cooling scoops, side exhausts and a painted <b>roll</b> <b>bar</b> (2522’s <b>roll</b> <b>bar</b> was chromed). Suspension options included Koni shock absorbers, front and rear anti-sway bars, unpolished six-inch magnesium pin-drive wheels, and Goodyear Blue Streak Sports Car Special tires.|$|E

25|$|Brothers Larry and Don Hess raced a Marlin in the 1966 24 Hours of Daytona. Sponsored by Queen City Rambler, a Charlotte, North Carolina AMC dealership, the car ran almost stock, {{even with}} a radio antenna. The {{passenger}} seats were removed, a <b>roll</b> <b>bar</b> installed, and the factory exhaust system replaced with open headers that exited below the doors. The Marlin retired after 80 laps with overheating and steering problems, and was reportedly sold as a used car after the race.|$|E

25|$|The {{modifications}} to the Concord started with a two-door sedan monocoque (unitized) body. To add strength to the platform after the removal of its roof, fourteen steel reinforcements were welded to the undercarriage and a steel targa <b>roll</b> <b>bar</b> was welded to the door pillars for rigidity, as well as additional passenger compartment protection. The front section of the roof (ahead of the targa bar) was a removable lightweight fiberglass hatch, while the rear section of polyvinyl material folded and included a tonneau cover {{for use in the}} down position.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, AMC {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} with the Griffith Company for a convertible body style Eagle, and a prototype version was developed. The cars were marketed during the 1981 and 1982 model years as the Sundancer conversion. The Eagle's monocoque (unibody) body was reinforced and a steel targa <b>roll</b> <b>bar</b> was welded to the door pillars for passenger compartment protection. The front portion of the roof was a removable lightweight fiberglass hatch, while the rear section of polyvinyl material and the back window folded down and had a boot cover when in the down position.|$|E
25|$|GAV Swan is a six-wheeled terrain assault vehicle. Its {{full name}} is the Ground Assault Vehicle JL-723. It has a {{gyrostabilized}} platform {{so when it}} travels over rough terrain, the gunner platform is stabilized. The extended gunner's chair can rise up 3.6 meters above the vehicle to see over obstructions between the gun and the target, like the long neck of a swan, hence the name. This 6x6 is built for all terrain, and its permalloy armor and four turret-mounted sixty-millimeter rotary autocannons provide protection from the Pandoran environment. The wheels have little armor and are designed with a thick polymer alloy. Swans have a gyrostabilized system that rotates a full 360 degrees. Swans also have a <b>roll</b> <b>bar</b> and four rear headlights. Swans have redundant fuel cells in the rear. When the chair extends, the ammunition storage canister {{is located at the}} back.|$|E

50|$|One major {{legacy that}} was left behind by Medlen {{happened}} after his death, the NHRA enacted a new safety requirement within the Funny Car division, that states that the <b>roll</b> <b>bars</b> within the car now have to be padded. The <b>roll</b> <b>bars</b> are padded with a heavy foam rubber insulation and wrapped with seven layers of Nomex fabric to make the foam rubber more resistant to fire. This has dramatically reduced the kinds of injuries among drivers that Medlen suffered which ultimately resulted in his death.|$|R
40|$|Tensile {{fatigue tests}} were {{performed}} under load control, with constant stress range Δσ on pearlitic steel wires, {{from the hot}} <b>rolled</b> <b>bar</b> to the commercial prestressing steel wire (which has undergone seven cold drawing steps). Results show that fatigue cracks in pearlitic steels initiate at the wire surface starting from small defects, whose size decreases with the drawing process. Fatigue cracks created from defects (initiation phase) exhibit a fractographic appearance consisting of ductile microtearing events which can be classified as tearing topography surface or TTS, and exhibit a remarkably lower spacing in the prestressing steel wire than in the hot <b>rolled</b> <b>bar.</b> In addition, some S-N tests were performed in both material forms under a stress range of about half the yield strength. In these tests, {{the main part of}} the fatigue life corresponds to the propagation stage in the hot <b>rolled</b> <b>bar</b> whereas such a main part of the life is associated with the initiation stage in the case of the prestressing steel wire...|$|R
25|$|At Rial's début race, the 1988 Brazilian Grand Prix, de Cesaris {{qualified}} 14th {{and reached}} sixth {{place in the}} race, but {{he ran out of}} fuel seven laps from the end. Mechanical failures occurred during the following races, and Rial twice breached regulations; for working on the car on-track and the drivers head being above the <b>roll</b> <b>bar</b> - necessitating a modification of the car. The fuel tank was again a problem in Canada where de Cesaris ran out of fuel in fifth place; however the next race in Detroit saw Rial finish in fourth place, scoring three points. After the , the teams performance began to fall, and Brunner left the team after finishing 13th in their home race in Germany. Continuous mechanical problems and the fuel tank contributed to a six-race string of retirements, de Cesaris finishing the season classified 8th in Australia. The team finished in ninth place in the constructors championship, and Andrea de Cesaris was placed fifteenth in the drivers championship.|$|E
25|$|On September 16, 1979, Hinton {{was racing}} the RB-51 in the Reno Air Races when a {{capacitor}} in the magneto failed, causing {{the engine to}} run on half its spark plugs. Not knowing what was wrong, Hinton pushed the plane to full throttle. This resulted in the supercharger carrying the extra pressure. Eventually, a bearing in the supercharger failed. Hinton finished the race in second place and moved to make an emergency landing. The supercharger failure resulted in a shaft failure, however; that shaft drove the oil pump, which in turn controlled the propeller pitch. The propellers went flat, acting as a huge air brake. The RB-51 crashed short of the runway. The wings were sheared off as the plane came down between two piles of rock and the fuel erupted in a fireball. The cockpit was thrown end-over-end away from the fire, yet Hinton survived with a broken back, leg, and ankle. His survival is attributed {{by one of the}} lead engineers, Pete Law, to additional braces and a <b>roll</b> <b>bar</b> installed on the cockpit.|$|E
500|$|The {{interior}} of the P4/5 was designed by Glickenhaus himself with an iPod nano stereo and a tablet PC which features not only GPS but a 3D model of the car {{as well as a}} complete parts list and manual for easy servicing. The P4/5 also sports improved air conditioning over the Enzo and a high-strength alloy <b>roll</b> <b>bar</b> redesigned because the original was too thick and obstructed Glickenhaus' view. The seats are custom built, Glickenhaus' and his son's bodies were scanned so Pininfarina could mould the seats for their comfort, accessibility and view of the road (as with race cars). With a frame of carbon fibre composite, the seats are covered with a black mesh and red leather as selected by Glickenhaus' daughter. Pininfarina rearranged the wiring of the car so as to make the car easier to service and [...] lighter than the Enzo.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} the {{refining}} slag composition on the total oxygen content and inclusions in steel was investigated in 100 t UHP Electric Furnace – LF – Billet CC process. The test steel was 77 B hard wire steel and Si-Mn alloy {{was used as the}} deoxidizer. Three types slag were used in the industrial tests, which including CaO-CaF 2, CaO-CaF 2 adding CaC and CaO-Al 2 O 3 refining slag. The results shown that the lowest total oxygen contents of <b>rolled</b> <b>bar</b> can be gained using the CaO-CaF 2 refining slag adding CaC, which is 0. 0036 %, while the total oxygen contents of <b>rolled</b> <b>bar</b> using CaO-Al 2 O 3 refining slag is higher a little than the heats using CaO-CaF 2 refining slag. The CaO-SiO 2 and CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 compound inclusions with the size of about 5 µm are the main inclusions in the heats refining by the CaO-CaF 2 refining slag in the <b>rolled</b> <b>bar,</b> but the pure, indeformable Al 2 O 3 inclusion can also be found with the size of about 10 µm. The CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 -MnO compound inclusions are the main inclusions in the heats refining by the CaO-CaF 2 -CaC refining slag, but most of the inclusion shape is irregular with bigger size of about 10 µm. Similar with the heat using CaO-CaF 2 refining slag, the pure Al 2 O 3 inclusion with edge angle {{can be found in the}} <b>rolled</b> <b>bar.</b> The inclusions in the <b>rolled</b> <b>bar</b> treated by CaO-Al 2 O 3 refining slag are CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 compound inclusions, most of which are nearly globular shape with th...|$|R

2500|$|The initial {{tests of}} the Ford Excursion were [...] "horrifying" [...] {{for its ability to}} vault over the hood of a Ford Taurus. The big SUV was {{modified}} to include a type of blocker bar suggested by the French transportation ministry in 1971, a kind of under-vehicle <b>roll</b> <b>bar</b> designed to keep the large Ford Excursion from rolling over cars that were hit by it. The problem is [...] "impact incompatibility", where the [...] "hard points" [...] of the end of chassis rails of SUVs are higher than the [...] "hard points" [...] of cars, causing the SUV to override the engine compartment and crumple zone of the car. There have been few regulations covering designs of SUVs to address the safety issue. The problem of heavy weight is a risk factor present for very large passenger cars, not only with SUVs. The typically higher SUV bumper heights and those built using stiff truck-based frames, also increases risks in crashes with passenger cars. The Mercedes ML320 was designed with bumpers at the same height as required for passenger cars.|$|E
