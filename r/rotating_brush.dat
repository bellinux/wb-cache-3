25|$|A {{vacuum cleaner}} uses a partial vacuum to suck up dust and dirt, usually from floors. Daniel Hess of West Union, Iowa, invented the first vacuum cleaner in 1860. Calling it a carpet sweeper {{instead of a}} vacuum cleaner, his machine did, in fact, have a <b>rotating</b> <b>brush</b> like a {{traditional}} vacuum cleaner which also possessed an elaborate bellows mechanism {{on top of the}} body to generate suction of dust and dirt. Hess received a patent (U.S. patent #29,077) for his invention of the first vacuum cleaner on July 10, 1860. Despite credit usually going to English inventor Hubert Cecil Booth for inventing the first electric vacuum cleaner in 1901, his vacuum was actually predated two years by an American, John Thurman of St. Louis, Missouri, who invented the motorized vacuum cleaner in 1899. However, neither were practical or useful. The first practical and portable vacuum cleaner was built in 1907, when James Murray Spangler, a janitor from Canton, Ohio, incorporated a <b>rotating</b> <b>brush,</b> an electric fan, a box, and one of his wife's pillowcases to serve as the dust bag.|$|E

Microbial samples were collected at different distances from the <b>rotating</b> <b>brushes,</b> different heights above the water surface, and different operation state over a 3 -month period (April, May, and June) in order to estimate the seasonal variation and site-related distribution characteristics of the microorganisms present. The concentration of bacterial aerosol was analyzed by culture methods, while their dominant species, genetic structure and diversity were assayed using bio-molecular tools. Results showed that total microbial concentrations were highest in June and lowest in April. The mechanical rotation caused remarkable variation in concentration and diversity of culturable airborne bacteria before and after the <b>rotating</b> <b>brushes.</b> The highest concentration was observed near the <b>rotating</b> <b>brushes</b> (931 +/- 129 - 3, 952 +/- 730 CFU/m(3)), with concentration decreasing as distance and height increased. Bacterial community polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis indicated that diversity decreased gradually with increasing height above the water surface but remained relatively constant at the same height. All dominant bacteria identified by DNA sequence analysis belonged to Firmicutes. Pathogenic species such as Moraxella nonliquefaciens and Flavobacterium odoratum were isolated from the bioaerosols. Due to the serious health risks involved, exposure of sewage workers to airborne microorganisms caused by brush aerators should be monitored and controlled...|$|R

40|$|Surface {{arthropods}} on {{pome fruits}} can cause export problems and disrupt commercial markets. Eliminating {{insects and mites}} on the packing line {{would be the last}} opportunity to provide for pest-free produce. In this study, an experimental packing line was used to evaluate techniques using different surfactant baths, pressurized water sprays, and styles of <b>rotating</b> <b>brushes</b> to remove field-collected and laboratory-reared grape mealybug, Pseudococcus maritimus (Ehrhorn) (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae), the diapausing two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) and the woolly apple aphid, Eriosoma lanigerum (Hausman) (Homoptera: Aphididae). The organosilicone Silwet L- 77 was no more effective than a silicone-based food grade defoamer in aiding removal. Mechanical methods, such as the style of <b>rotating</b> <b>brushes</b> and pressurized sprays, were significantly effective in removing surface arthropods.

50|$|In {{the case}} of a drum-style pulley, without a groove or flanges, the pulley often is {{slightly}} convex to keep the flat belt centred. It is sometimes referred to as a crowned pulley. Though once widely used on factory line shafts, this type of pulley is still found driving the <b>rotating</b> <b>brush</b> in upright vacuum cleaners, in belt sanders and bandsaws. Agricultural tractors built up to the early 1950s generally had a belt pulley for a flat belt (which is what Belt Pulley magazine was named after). It has been replaced by other mechanisms with more flexibility in methods of use, such as power take-off and hydraulics.|$|E
50|$|The drum, {{having already}} been {{partially}} discharged during detack, is further discharged by light. Any remaining toner, {{that did not}} transfer in step 6, {{is removed from the}} drum surface by a <b>rotating</b> <b>brush</b> under suction, or a squeegee known as the cleaning blade. This 'waste' toner usually is routed into a waste toner compartment for later disposal; however, in some systems, it is routed back into the developer unit for reuse. This process, known as toner reclaim, is much more economical, but can possibly lead to a reduced overall toner efficiency through a process known as 'toner polluting' whereby concentration levels of toner/developer having poor electrostatic properties are permitted to build up in the developer unit, reducing the overall efficiency of the toner in the system.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1990s, new {{polymers}} began literally encapsulating (crystallizing) {{soil particles}} into dry residues on contact, {{in a process}} now regarded by the industry as a growing, up-and-coming technology; working like [...] "tiny sponges", the deep-cleaning compound crystals dissolve and absorb dirt prior to its removal from the carpet. Cleaning solution is applied by rotary machine, [...] "CRB" [...] counter <b>rotating</b> <b>brush,</b> brush applicator, or compression sprayer. Dry residue is vacuumable immediately, either separately or from a built-in unit of the cleaning system machine. According to ICS Cleaning Specialist, evidence suggests encapsulation improves carpet appearance, compared to other systems; and it is favorable in terms of high-traffic needs, operator training, equipment expense, and lack of wet residue. Encapsulation carpet cleaning also keeps carpets cleaner {{for longer periods of}} time compared to other methods.

40|$|Bacterial {{community}} {{structure and}} the chemical components in aerosols caused by <b>rotating</b> <b>brushes</b> in an Orbal oxidation ditch were assessed in a Beijing municipal wastewater treatment plant. Air samples were collected at different distances from the aerosol-generating <b>rotating</b> <b>brushes.</b> Molecular culture-independent methods were used to characterize the community structure of the airborne bacteria in each sample regardless of cell culturability. A clone library of 16 S rDNA directly amplified from air DNA of each sample was constructed and sequenced to analyze the community composition and diversity. Insoluble particles and water-soluble ions emitted with microorganisms in aerosols were analysis by a scanning electron microscope together with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and ion chromatogram analyzer. In total, most of the identified bacteria were Proteobacteria. The majority of sequences near the <b>rotating</b> <b>brushes</b> (the main source of the bioaerosols) were Proteobacteria (62. 97 %) with beta-(18. 52 %) and gamma-(44. 45 %) subgroups and Bacteroidetes (29. 63 %). Complex patterns were observed for each sampling location, suggesting a highly diverse community structure, comparable to that found in water in the Orbal oxidation ditch. Accompany with microorganisms, 46. 36 mu g/m(3) of SO (4) (2 -), 29. 35 mu g/m(3) of Cl-, 21. 51 mu g/m(3) of NO (3) (-), 19. 76 mu g/m(3) of NH (4) (+), 11. 42 mu g/m(3) of PO (4) (3 -), 6. 18 mu g/m(3) of NO (2) (-), and elements of Mg, Cl, K, Na, Fe, S, and P were detected from the air near the aerosols source. Differences {{in the structure of}} the bacterial communities and chemical components in the aerosols observed between sampling sites indicated important site-related variability. The composition of microorganisms in water was one of the most important sources of bacterial communities in bioaerosols. Chemical components in bioaerosols may provide a media for airborne microorganism attachment, as well as a suitable microenvironment for their growth and survival in the air.

He went on to develop the garden tool himself. The first year, sales were over a half million dollars. By 1977 they were $80 million, and Ballas sold his company the following year to Emerson Electric Company.|$|R
5000|$|The {{difference}} from conventional wire-brushing with an angle grinder lies {{first with the}} mounting of the bristles in the <b>rotating</b> <b>brush.</b> With a conventional rotary brush, the wire bristles are mounted rigidly in the hub, bristles sometimes being twisted or knotted in groups for extra stiffness. With bristle blasting, the wires are mounted resiliently in a flexible belt. As the brush rotates, immediately before contacting the work, rows of bristles are trapped behind a fixed [...] 'accelerator bar' , which causes them to bend backwards in their flexible mount. As the bristles pass the accelerator bar, they are released to spring forwards. The extra energy stored for each bristle when being flexed backwards is added to their kinetic energy when released, and when they impact {{the surface of the}} workpiece. This gives a more violent impact with the surface, thus greater cleaning power, compared to a simple rotary brush at the same speed.|$|E
5000|$|Hoover's {{business}} {{began to}} flourish, and, {{a year after}} Hoover acquired the patent from Spangler, he established a research and development department for his new business. By 1926, Hoover had developed the 'beater bar' - a metal bar attached to the <b>rotating</b> <b>brush</b> roll, situated in the floor nozzle cavity of the upright vacuum cleaner. [...] Introduced on Models 543 and 700, the beater bars alternated with the sweeping brushes to vibrate the carpet while sucking. It provided a more distinct 'tap' than the bristle tufts used on the former machines, {{and led to a}} 101% increase in efficiency. This cleaning action was marketed by Hoover as [...] "Positive Agitation". 'It Beats...as it Sweeps...as it Cleans' rang more true now than ever. In 1929, Hoover introduced the Model 200 Duster. This would be their first attempt at a cylinder cleaner. It used a Model 575 motor with a modified suction impeller, which was mounted on a unique aluminum body with runners, allowing the cleaner to be pulled behind the user. The Duster was produced for only three months and roughly 9,000 were made.|$|E
5000|$|In 1906 James B. Kirby {{developed}} his {{first of many}} vacuums called the [...] "Domestic Cyclone". It used water for dirt separation. Later revisions {{came to be known}} as the Kirby Vacuum Cleaner. In 1907 department store janitor James Murray Spangler (1848-1915) of Canton, Ohio invented the first portable electric vacuum cleaner, obtaining a patent for the Electric Suction Sweeper on June 2, 1908. Crucially, in addition to suction from an electric fan that blew the dirt and dust into a soap box and one of his wife's pillow cases, Spangler's design utilized a <b>rotating</b> <b>brush</b> to loosen debris. Unable to produce the design himself due to lack of funding, he sold the patent in 1908 to local leather goods manufacturer William Henry Hoover (1849-1932), who had Spangler's machine redesigned with a steel casing, casters, and attachments, founding the company that in 1922 was renamed the Hoover Company. Their first vacuum was the 1908 Model O, which sold for $60. Subsequent innovations included the beater bar in 1919 ("It beats as it sweeps as it cleans"), disposal filter bags in the 1920s, and an upright vacuum cleaner in 1926.|$|E

50|$|Following {{the idle}} zone and/or high {{pressure}} arch (if applicable) is the friction zone. In the friction zone, {{a variety of}} brushes are used to clean all of the vehicle's surfaces. Wrap-around brushes (wraps) clean the front, sides, and rear of a car. A set of wraps consists of two offset brushes which are attached to overhead arms which are generally mounted over {{the center of the}} tunnel. Some wrap-around brush designs use jointed side-mounted arms to increase the brush's front and rear contact time. Wraps typically rotate with the vehicle's direction of travel. Some wrap-around brushes are capable of switching direction while cleaning the front of a car to prevent customers' license plates from being bent. Wraps are supplemented by side brushes (ranging in size from 18 inches cm up to 63 inches cm tall or higher). Side brushes may be either top or bottom mounted. To conserve space, side brushes are often staggered in the space occupied by a set of wraps or placed under top surface cleaning components, such as top brushes or mitters. Side brushes rotate against the vehicle's direction of travel to increase cleaning power. Top brushes are <b>rotating</b> <b>brush</b> assemblies which clean the vehicle's top surfaces. A top brush can face either the entrance or exit of the tunnel to assist in cleaning the car's front or rear. Some specialized top brushes are designed to achieve more contact time with the front or rear of vehicles. To prevent damage, a top brush can be programmed to retract if an ultrasonic pick-up truck bed detection system detects a pick-up truck with an open bed. In many car washes, top brushes are either supplemented by or replaced with mitters. Mitters are components which suspend cloth strips or sheets over the tunnel while utilizing motion to increase friction against the car's surface. A mitter's motion can be front to back, side to side, rotational, circular, or diagonal. The friction zone may also include specialized front grill and rear brushes. Front grill brushes clean the front, and in many cases, the sides of vehicles. They often appear as side washers with an unusually long and bent arm. Instead of bent arms, some front grill brushes use jointed arms. Like standard side washers, a grill brush may be either top or bottom driven. Rear brushes appear as a specialized tall side washers with long arms that face the entrance of the tunnel. Once a car's mirror passes a rear brush, the brush makes contact with the vehicle's side, where it then continues to engage until the assembly cleans the rear of the car. Additional high pressure components may also be present in the main friction zone.|$|E
