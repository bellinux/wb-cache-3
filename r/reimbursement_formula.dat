Nurse communication, as measured on the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey, has been cited as the single most powerful influencer of a patient’s overall experience.

40|$|In {{the early}} 19602 ̆ 7 s, {{a number of}} {{observers}} argued that the current method of reimbursing hospitals by third parties would be a factor contributing to increasing hospital costs.

It is argued that a prospective <b>reimbursement</b> <b>formula</b> be negotiated and developed that depends on two factors: 1. an agreed upon rate of general inflation, and 2. an estimated cost function which captures important aspects of the case-mix which accounts for differential costs across hospitals. The cost function is presented, and various aspects of the proposed formula are discussed...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 removes work disincentives and {{promotes}} access to vocational services {{for people with}} disabilities. This study calculated the amount of payments {{that would have been}} made to employment service providers if study participants had been enrolled in the Ticket program. METHODS: Data were from 450 Social Security Disability Insurance beneficiaries with psychiatric disabilities enrolled in a multisite study of supported employment. Earnings over two years were used to calculate provider payments under two reimbursement formulas used in the Ticket program. RESULTS: Only a quarter of service recipients (26 percent) reached earnings levels that would have triggered provider payments under the first <b>reimbursement</b> <b>formula.</b> Only 4 percent would have completed their trial work period and left the rolls, generating payments under the second formula. CONCLUSIONS: The current provider payment systems of the Ticket to Work program do not reflect the reality of rehabilitation for individuals with severe mental illness. Reforms should take into account outcomes of return-to-work services for this population...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} U. S. {{pharmaceutical}} drug shortages {{is one that}} has steadily grown in severity {{over the course of the}} past decade, particularly in the years since 2006. Some types of drugs have proven to be more susceptible to shortage than others, particularly sterile injectable drugs. Many oncology drugs are sterile injectables, and an increasing number of sterile injectable oncology drugs have been subject to shortage in recent years. Shortages can led to delayed treatments, errors stemming from the use of alternative drugs, increased costs, and negative patient outcomes including death. While shortages occur for a number of different reasons, some have blamed changes contained within the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003 that changed the way that Medicare reimbursement rates for drugs were calculated. Contrary to assertions that MMA is capping the growth rates of reimbursements for drugs and thus causing shortages to occur, the new MMA rate formula does not appear to be limiting the rate at which reimbursements can grow. This report does recommend, however, that the current <b>reimbursement</b> <b>formula</b> be adjusted so that rates are based on data gathered monthly rather than quarterly, reducing the length of the delay between price signals from the drug market and the adjustment of reimbursement rates...|$|E
40|$|The cost {{of drugs}} used in {{hospitals}} {{and other health care}} institutions is continuing to escalate, but there has been no effort made to determine what knowledge the pharmacy administrator has in reference to drug costs. In addition, there had been almost no attempts made to design a method to chart the changes taking place in the cost of drugs used {{in hospitals and}} other health care facilities. ^ This study surveyed selected hospitals in the United States to determine what information was available concerning drug cost, what method of control was used to determine if costs were changing and what methods of charting changes were recommended by the pharmacy administrators surveyed. The writer also developed and tested a group of indices that could be used by a health care facility to chart changes in the cost of drugs and to determine why these changes were taking place. ^ The study concluded that the pharmacy administrators surveyed had very little knowledge concerning the cost of hospital operations, the cost of drugs or the reasons that the cost of drugs change. A series of indices were used to describe and chart drug changes in a selected hospital showing that changes might be due to inflation, census, patient-mix or pharmacologic drug use. ^ The importance of this information was demonstrated for the budgeting process, third party <b>reimbursement</b> <b>formulas</b> and the development of drug utilization review programs. It recommended that health care facilities use indices to chart drug costs {{in order to be able}} to control this supply expense better. ...|$|R
40|$|Tamura, Lauer, and Sanborn (1985) {{reported}} a multiple regression {{approach to the}} problem of determining a cost <b>reimbursement</b> (rate-setting) <b>formula</b> for facilities providing long-term care (nursing homes). In this article we propose an alternative approach to this problem, using an absolute-error criterion instead of the least-squares criterion used in regression, with a variety of side constraints incorporated in the derivation of the formula. The mathematical tool for implementation of this approach is linear programming (LP). The article begins with a discussion of the desirable characteristics of a rate-setting formula. The development of a formula with these properties can be easily achieved, in terms of modeling as well as computation, using LP. Specifically, LP provides an efficient computational algorithm to minimize absolute error deviation, thus protecting rates from the effects of unusual observations in the data base. LP also offers modeling flexibility to impose a variety of policy controls. These features are not readily available if a least-squares criterion is used. Examples based on actual data are used to illustrate alternative LP models for rate setting...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Long Term Acute Care Hospitals (LTACs) {{are subject}} to Medicare rules because they accept Medicare and Medicaid patients. In October 2002, Medicare changed the LTAC <b>reimbursement</b> <b>formulas,</b> from a cost basis system to a Prospective Payment System (PPS). This study {{examines}} whether the PPS has negatively affected the financial performance of the LTAC hospitals in the period following the reimbursement change (2003 - 2006), {{as compared to the}} period prior to the change (1999 - 2003), and if so, to what extent. This study will also examine whether the PPS has resulted in a decreased average patient length of stay (LOS) in the LTAC hospitals for the period of 2003 - 2006 as compared to the prior period of 1999 - 2003, and if so, to what extent. ^ Methods. The study group consists of two large LTAC hospital systems, Kindred Healthcare Inc. and Select Specialty Hospitals of Select Medical Corporation. Financial data and operational indicators were reviewed, tabulated and dichotomized into two groups, covering the two periods: 1999 - 2002 and 2003 - 2006. The financial data included net annual revenues, net income, revenue per patient per day and profit margins. It was hypothesized that the profit margins for the LTAC hospitals were reduced because of the new PPS. Operational indicators, such as annual admissions, annual patient days, and average LOS were analyzed. It was hypothesized that LOS for the LTAC hospitals would have decreased. Case mix index, defined as the weighted average of patients’ DRGs for each hospital system, was not available to cast more light on the direction of LOS. ^ Results. This assessment found that the negative financial impacts did not materialize; instead, financial performance improved during the PPS period (2003 - 2006). The income margin percentage under the PPS increased for Kindred by 24 %, and for Select by 77 %. Thus, the study’s working hypothesis of reduced income margins for the LTACs under the PPS was contradicted. As to the average patient length of stay, LOS decreased from 34. 7 days to 29. 4 days for Kindred, and from 30. 5 days to 25. 3 days for Select. Thus, on the issue of LTAC shorter length of stay, the study’s working hypothesis was confirmed. ^ Conclusion. Overall, there was no negative financial effect on the LTAC hospitals during the period of 2003 - 2006 following Medicare implementation of the PPS in October 2002. On the contrary, the income margins improved significantly. ^ During the same period, LOS decreased following the implementation of the PPS. This was consistent with the LTAC hospitals’ pursuit of financial incentives. ...|$|R
