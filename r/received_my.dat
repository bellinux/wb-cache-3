500|$|There is some {{contention}} over Burnet's {{publication of}} {{his version of the}} theory in the Australian Journal of Science in 1957. Some commentators argue he published in an Australian journal to fast-track his hypothesis and obtain priority for his theory over ideas that were published later that year in a paper written by David Talmage, which Burnet had read prior to its publication. In his paper Burnet cited Talmage's review, and in a later interview, Talmage said he believed that Burnet [...] "truthfully had developed the idea before he <b>received</b> <b>my</b> paper". The theory is now sometimes known as Burnet's clonal selection theory, which overlooks the contributions of Ehrlich, Jerne, Talmage, and the contributions of Lederberg, who conceptualised the genetics of clonal selection.|$|E
500|$|A {{year after}} the song was {{published}} Dresser's brother Theodore, who later became a famous novelist, privately claimed to have authored its lyrics. In 1917, after Dresser's 1906 death, Theodore made his controversial claim public in a newspaper article. Already a controversial figure because of his open support for communism and tendency to make negative comments about his home state, Theodore's claims were ridiculed in many papers and by prominent Hoosiers who dismissed it as a hoax. Although Theodore never retracted his assertion that he wrote the first verse and chorus of the song, he downplayed the importance of his alleged contribution in later years. It is possible that Theodore did give his brother {{the idea for the}} song, and may have even authored a portion of the lyrics, some of which reflect his writing style. The line stating [...] "where I first <b>received</b> <b>my</b> lessons, nature's school" [...] is a possible link, reflecting Theodore's obsession with nature during his youth and his belief that it held the answers to life, a topic he wrote of on several occasions.|$|E

2500|$|As a congressman, Palmer aligned {{himself with}} the {{progressive}} wing of the Democratic Party, advocating lower tariffs despite the popularity of tariffs in his home district and state. In his second term, he won {{a seat on the}} Ways and Means Committee chaired by Oscar Underwood. There he was the principal author of the detailed tariff schedules that a Republican Senator denounced as [...] "the most radical departure in the direction of free trade that has been proposed by any party during the last 70 years." [...] He argued that tariffs profited business and had no benefit for workers. Pennsylvania industry, notably the large mining and manufacturing firms, opposed his tariff scheme, which pleased Palmer, who stated: [...] "I have <b>received</b> <b>my</b> notice from the Bethlehem Steel Company. ...

Roberts states that with three feet of snow, a dwindling supply of chocolate, and no morning kindergarten she had little else to do. While writing down her ideas for the first time, {{she fell in love}} with the writing process, and quickly produced six manuscripts. She submitted her manuscripts to Harlequin, the leading publisher of romance novels, but was repeatedly rejected. Roberts says, [...] "I got the standard rejection for the first couple of tries, then my favorite rejection of all time. I <b>received</b> <b>my</b> manuscript back with a nice little note which said that my work showed promise, and the story had been very entertaining and well done. But that they already had their American writer. That would have been Janet Dailey." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Australian cruiser reached Emden around 16:00. The Germans' battle ensign {{was still}} flying, {{generally}} {{a sign that}} a ship intends to continue fighting. Sydney signalled [...] "Do you surrender?" [...] in international code by both lights and flag-hoist. The signal was not understood, and Emden responded with [...] "What signal? No signal books". The instruction to surrender was repeated by Sydney in plain morse code, then after there was no reply, the message [...] "Have you <b>received</b> <b>my</b> signal?" [...] was sent. With no response forthcoming, and operating {{under the assumption that}} Emden could still potentially fire, launch torpedoes, or use small arms against any boarding parties, Glossop ordered Sydney to fire two salvoes into the wrecked ship. This attack killed 20 German personnel. The ensign was pulled down and burned, and a white sheet was raised over the quarter-deck as a flag of surrender. During the battle, 130 personnel aboard Emden were killed, and 69 were wounded, four of the latter died of their wounds.|$|E
2500|$|Crosby {{had lived}} for decades in such areas of Manhattan as Hell's Kitchen, the Bowery, and the Tenderloin. She {{was aware of the}} great needs of {{immigrants}} and the urban poor, and was passionate to help those around her through urban rescue missions and other compassionate ministry organizations. [...] "From the time I <b>received</b> <b>my</b> first check for my poems, I made up my mind to open my hand wide to those who needed assistance". Throughout her life, she was described as having [...] "a horror of wealth", never set prices for her speaking engagements, often refused honoraria, and [...] "what little she did accept she gave away almost as soon as she got it". She and her husband also organized concerts, with half the proceeds given to aid the poor. Throughout New York City, Crosby's sympathies for the poor were well-known, but consisted primarily of indirect involvement by giving contributions from the sale of her poems, and by writing and sending poems for special occasions for these missions to the dispossessed, as well as sporadic visits to those missions.|$|E

2500|$|In 1884, {{following}} his final term at Carlisle, Standing Bear, {{armed with a}} recommendation by Captain Pratt, returned home to the Rosebud Agency, Rosebud, South Dakota, where he was hired as an assistant at the reservation's school at the salary of three hundred dollars a year. In 1890, some time after Wounded Knee, Luther moved from Rosebud and followed his father and brother Ellis Standing Bear to Pine Ridge, South Dakota. [...] Pine Ridge provided a series of varying employment and family ventures. In 1891, Luther became principal of a reservation day school. Standing Bear also worked in his uncle’s little general store. [...] One day {{they were talking about}} the delay in mail delivery. [...] “I told my uncle that John Wanamaker, the man for whom I had worked in Philadelphia, was Postmaster-General, and that I would write and see if we could not have a post office established at his camp. [...] I suggested that we call it Kyle. [...] It was a short name and easy to spell. [...] When Mr. Wanamaker <b>received</b> <b>my</b> letter, he replied immediately. [...] He was pleased with my suggestion, but said that he could not appoint me postmaster, as I was an Indian. [...] It would have to be some white man. [...] There was a Joseph Taylor who was one of our missionaries, and we sent his name. [...] He received the appointment, but I took care of the office.” [...] Later, Luther opened a dry goods store with his brother Ellis at Pass Creek and started a small ranch raising horses and cattle. Standing Bear organized public meetings at his dry goods store in Pine Ridge to discuss treaties and current events.|$|E
