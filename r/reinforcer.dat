5|$|Behaviorists {{focus on}} the {{acquisition}} and teaching of delayed gratification, and have developed therapeutic techniques for increasing ability to delay. Behavior analysts capitalize on the effective principles of reinforcement when shaping behavior by making rewards contingent on the person's current behavior, which promotes learning a delay of gratification. It {{is important to note}} that for a behavior modification regimen to succeed, the reward must have some value to the participant. Without a reward that is meaningful, providing delayed or immediate gratification serves little purpose, as the reward is not a strong <b>reinforcer</b> of the desired behavior.|$|E
5|$|Compared to neurotypical children, {{those with}} ADHD {{generally}} demonstrate greater impulsivity by being influenced by reward immediacy and quality more {{than by the}} frequency of reward and effort to obtain it. However, researchers have empirically shown that these impulsive behavior patterns can be changed through {{the implementation of a}} simple self-control training procedure in which <b>reinforcer</b> immediacy competes with the frequency, quantity or saliency of the reward, and the delay is gradually increased. One study demonstrated that any verbal activity while waiting for reinforcement increases delay to gratification in participants with ADHD. In another study, 3 children diagnosed with ADHD and demonstrating impulsivity were trained to prefer reward rate and saliency more than immediacy through manipulation {{of the quality of the}} reinforcers and by systematically increasing the delay with a changing-criterion design. Post-assessment of the children illustrated that self-control can transfer to untrained dimensions of reinforcement; such as an increase in quality over immediacy preference due to direct training resulting in an increase in quantity over immediacy preference.|$|E

25|$|Reinforcement is the {{key element}} in operant {{conditioning}} and in most behavior change programs. It is {{the process by which}} behavior is strengthened. If a behavior is followed closely in time by a stimulus and this results in an increase in the future frequency of that behavior, then the stimulus is a positive <b>reinforcer.</b> If the removal of an event serves as a <b>reinforcer,</b> this is termed negative reinforcement. There are multiple schedules of reinforcement that affect the future probability of behavior.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, a {{motivating}} {{operation that}} causes {{a decrease in}} the effectiveness of a <b>reinforcer,</b> or diminishes a learned behavior related to the <b>reinforcer,</b> functions as an abolishing operation, AO. Again using the example of food, satiation of food prior to the presentation of a food stimulus would produce a decrease on food-related behaviors, and diminish or completely abolish the reinforcing effect of acquiring and ingesting the food. Consider the board of a large investment bank, concerned with a too small profit margin, deciding to give the CEO a new incentive package in order to motivate him to increase firm profits. If the CEO already has a lot of money, the incentive package might not be a very good way to motivate him, because he would be satiated on money. Getting even more money wouldn't be a strong <b>reinforcer</b> for profit-increasing behavior, and wouldn't elicit increased intensity, frequency or duration of profit-increasing behavior.|$|E
25|$|Motivating operations, MOs, {{relate to}} the field of {{motivation}} in that they help improve understanding aspects of behavior that are not covered by operant conditioning. In operant conditioning, the function of the <b>reinforcer</b> is to influence future behavior. The presence of a stimulus believed to function as a <b>reinforcer</b> does not according to this terminology explain the current behavior of an organism – only previous instances of reinforcement of that behavior (in the same or similar situations) do. Through the behavior-altering effect of MOs, it is possible to affect current behavior of an individual, giving another piece of the puzzle of motivation.|$|E

25|$|Continuous {{reinforcement}} (CRF) — {{each time}} a specific action is performed the subject receives a reinforcement. This method is effective when teaching a new behavior because it quickly establishes an association between the target behavior and the <b>reinforcer.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{basis of}} {{effective}} clicker training is precise timing {{to deliver the}} conditioned <b>reinforcer</b> {{at the same moment}} as the desired behaviour is offered. The clicker is used as a 'bridge' between the marking of the behaviour and the rewarding with a primary <b>reinforcer</b> such as a treat or a toy. The behaviour can be elicited by 'luring' where a hand gesture or a treat is used to coax the dog to sit, for example; or by 'shaping' where increasingly closer approximations to the desired behaviour are reinforced; and by 'capturing' where the dog's spontaneous offering of the behaviour is rewarded. Once a behaviour is learnt and is on cue (command), the clicker and the treats are faded out.|$|E
25|$|Motivating {{operations}} are {{factors that affect}} learned behavior in a certain context.

25|$|When a {{motivating}} operation causes {{an increase}} in the effectiveness of a <b>reinforcer,</b> or amplifies a learned behavior in some way (such as increasing frequency, intensity, duration or speed of the behavior), it functions as an establishing operation, EO. A common example of this would be food deprivation, which functions as an EO in relation to food: the food-deprived organism will perform behaviors previously related to the acquisition of food more intensely, frequently, longer, or faster in the presence of food, and those behaviors would be especially strongly reinforced. For instance, a fast-food worker earning minimal wage, forced to work more than one job to make ends meet, would be highly motivated by a pay raise, because of the current deprivation of money (a conditioned establishing operation). The worker would work hard to try to achieve the raise, and getting the raise would function as an especially strong <b>reinforcer</b> of work behavior.|$|E

25|$|The {{strength}} of reinforcement or punishment {{is dependent on}} schedule and timing. A <b>reinforcer</b> or punisher affects the future frequency of a behavior most strongly if it occurs within seconds of the behavior.

25|$|Prior to {{the seminal}} article on {{functional}} analytic methodology for aberrant behaviors, behaviorists used the behavioral technology {{available to them}} at the time. Instead of treating {{the function of the}} disruptive behavior, behavioral psychologists would instead pre-assume consequences to alter disruptive behaviors. For example, in the past to decrease self-injurious behavior in an individual, behaviorists may have delivered an aversive stimulus contingent on the response, or assume a <b>reinforcer</b> without identifying the <b>reinforcer</b> that would be most motivating to the client (Iwata, 1988). This type of intervention was successful to the individual, but it was not uncommon to see other variations of aberrant behavior begin to appear. When applied behavior analysts let clients choose from a wide array of reinforcers (often determined through data collection and reinforcement assessments) in the mid-1980s, reinforcement was shown to be more effective than punishment contingencies. In general, applied behavior analysis as a field favors reinforcement based interventions over aversive contingencies, but at the time the behavioral technology was not advanced enough and the individuals needing intervention had a right to an effective treatment (Van Houten et al., 1988). Nevertheless, not all behavioral therapies involved the use of aversives prior to the mid-1980s. Some behaviorists (for instance, B.F. Skinner) always preferred reinforcement and extinction contingencies over punishment even during that time.|$|E

The child determines activities and objects that will be used in a PRT exchange.

25|$|Respondent (classical) {{conditioning}} {{is based}} on innate stimulus-response relationships called reflexes. In his famous experiments with dogs, Pavlov usually used the salivary reflex, namely salivation (unconditioned response) following the taste of food (unconditioned stimulus). Pairing a neutral stimulus, for example a bell (conditioned stimulus) with food caused the bell to elicit salivation (conditioned response). Thus, in classical conditioning, the conditioned stimulus becomes a signal for a biologically significant consequence. Note that in respondent conditioning, unlike operant conditioning, the response does not produce a <b>reinforcer</b> or punisher (e.g. the dog does not get food because it salivates).|$|E
25|$|Like the {{marshmallow}} test, delay discounting {{is also a}} {{delay of}} gratification paradigm. It is designed around the principle that the subjective value of a <b>reinforcer</b> decreases, or is 'discounted,' as the delay to reinforcement increases. Subjects are given varying choices between smaller, immediate rewards and larger, delayed rewards. By manipulating reward magnitude and/or reward delay over multiple trials, 'indifference' points can be estimated whereby choosing the small, immediate reward, or the large, delayed reward are about equally likely. Subjects are labeled impulsive when their indifference points decline more steeply {{as a function of}} delay compared to the normal population (i.e., greater preference for immediate reward). Unlike the marshmallow test, delay discounting does not require verbal instruction and can be implemented on non-human animals.|$|E
