An enraged Corbin attacked Ambrose and executed the End of Days on {{him before he}} left the chamber, which allowed Miz to eliminate Ambrose. On the following SmackDown, Ambrose wanted to exact revenge on Corbin, however, he was attacked by Corbin just as Ambrose made his entrance for his match against James Ellsworth. Ambrose and Corbin then participated in the WWE Championship number one contender's battle royal, where Ambrose eliminated Corbin. Corbin again attacked Ambrose with the End of Days and Ambrose was eventually eliminated from the match. Ambrose called out Corbin {{over the next couple of}} weeks. Corbin attacked Ambrose backstage and proclaimed his desire to take the Intercontinental Championship from Ambrose. On the March 14 episode, Corbin formally challenged Ambrose for the title at WrestleMania 33. The following week during Corbin's match against Randy Orton, Ambrose caused a distraction and cost Corbin his match, before accepting Corbin's challenge and executed Dirty Deeds on him.

[...] In response, Flair wrote in his autobiography that Foley was [...] "a glorified stuntman" [...] {{and that he was}} able to climb the ladder in the WWF only because he was friends with the bookers. The two had a backstage confrontation at a Raw event in 2003, but Foley has said that they have largely reconciled. To spark the feud, Flair again called Foley a [...] "glorified stuntman" [...] and Foley called Flair a [...] "washed up piece of crap" [...] and challenged him to a match. The result was a Two-out-of-Three Falls match at Vengeance, where Flair beat Foley in two straight falls; with a <b>rollup</b> counter to the figure four in the first and by disqualification in the second after a trashcan shot. After the match, Flair was split wide open by Foley with a barbed-wire bat.

50|$|Kraft Foods (now renamed Mondelēz International) was {{an early}} example of a <b>rollup,</b> in the dairy industry.

Waste Management's {{acquisition}} of 133 small-time haulers quickly became the largest waste disposal company in the US. The characteristics {{that can make a}} <b>rollup</b> attractive are: there are many small players in fragmented markets or: where technology can play a role in revitalizing industries with small margins but technology can impact growth and profits. AutoNation was also a successful <b>rollup</b> effort in the car dealership space spearheaded by Wayne Huizenga, founder of Waste Management. The other reason companies do rollups is due to the higher earnings multiple achievable in businesses with large scale relative to smaller mom and pop operations which remain vulnerable to changing markets and poor access to capital markets. A recent <b>rollup</b> is Valeant Pharmaceuticals International that used more than $30 billion to acquire over 100 companies.|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of three-dimensional temporally evolving plane mixing layers through {{as many as}} three pairings has been simulated numerically. All simulations were begun from a few low-wavenumber disturbances, usually derived from linear stability theory, in addition to the mean velocity. Three-dimensional perturbations were used with amplitudes ranging from infinitesimal to large enough to trigger a rapid transition to turbulence. Pairing is found to inhibit the growth of infinitesimal three-dimensional disturbances, and to trigger the transition to turbulence in highly three-dimensional flows. The mechanisms responsible for the growth of three-dimensionality and onset of transition to turbulence are described. The transition to turbulence is accompanied by the formation of thin sheets of spanwise vorticity, which undergo secondary <b>rollups.</b> The post-transitional simulated flow fields exhibit many properties characteristic of turbulent flows...|$|R
40|$|In {{comparative}} proteomics studies, LC-MS/MS data {{is generally}} quantified using {{one or both}} of two measures: the spectral count, derived from the identification of MS/MS spectra, or some measure of ion abundance derived from the LC-MS data.

Yet, we claim that both researchers and vendors have overlooked UserDefined Aggregates (UDA) s, which can play an even more critical and pervasive role in database-centric data mining applications. Indeed, we show that: ffl Many data mining algorithms rely on specialized aggregates. ffl The number and diversity of these aggregates implies that (rather than vendors adding ad hoc builtins, [...] ...|$|R
