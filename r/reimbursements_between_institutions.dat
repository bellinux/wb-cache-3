The literature offers a broad consensus that bad institutions hamper trade and that trade liberalization engenders institutional reforms; however, MENA has generally been neglected in this literature, even though most {{countries in the region}} suffer from a clear deficit of “good” institutions. Taking into account the inverse relationship <b>between</b> <b>institutions</b> and trade, we use a gravity model that explains bilateral trade for disaggregated goods and service sectors for 21 MENA countries over the period 1995 - 2014. Our results show that in the presence of excessive zero trade observations, poor institutions can be considered as fixed export costs that help explain the zero probability of trade for some countries. We find that institutions do matter for trade after controlling for the endogeneity problem <b>between</b> <b>institutions</b> and trade.

40|$|This paper studies whether {{institutions}} {{matter for}} economic performance. For this aim, we first construct a simple framework illustrating how {{to examine the}} interaction <b>between</b> <b>institutions</b> and economic performance from {{a different point of}} view. Then, using this framework, we introduce an innovative estimation approach including cutting-edge econometric techniques so-called Johansen et al. (2000) co-integration methodology with structural breaks to empirically investigate the interaction <b>between</b> <b>institutions</b> and economic performance in Turkey. Co-integration analysis finds a long-run relationship <b>between</b> <b>institutions</b> and economic performance in the presence of structural breaks. Also, the estimate of structural breaks reveals the effect of noteworthy changes in institutional structure on investments and economic growth. The findings confirm that institutions matter for economic performance in Turkey, even though the institutional quality of the country is not satisfactory. Lastly, the results suggest that approach employed in this paper is useful and convenient to empirically investigate whether institutions matter for economic performance in the study of a country-level time-series data...|$|R

Moreover, the valuation effects vary according to the objective functions of institutions' administrators.

Our results confirm the usual positive impact of institutional quality on official output and total factor productivity, and its negative impact on {{the size of the}} underground economy. However, once output is corrected for the shadow economy, the relationship <b>between</b> <b>institutions</b> and output becomes weaker. The impact of institutions on total (“corrected”) factor productivity becomes insignificant. Differences in corrected output must then be attributed to differences in factor endowments. These results survive several tests for robustness. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|D. Cur. The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} study was to describe a model to facilitate collaboration <b>between</b> the <b>institutions</b> of higher education and psychiatric health care services {{in order to promote}} psychiatric clinical nursing education, with guidelines to operationalise the model. In spite of the calls by statutory bodies and contemporary legislation for collaboration <b>between</b> <b>institutions</b> of higher education and psychiatric health care services, there are few instances where formalised collaborative ventures exist to promote psychiatric clinical nursing education. Since the move of nursing education from hospital-based schools to colleges and universities, there was no attempt to redefine the most appropriate roles for nurse educators and clinical facilitators regarding student teaching and learning, given this realignment. The consequence was that the relationship <b>between</b> these <b>institutions</b> is characterised by territoriality; a lack of integration of knowledge and expertise of nurse educators and clinical facilitators; a lack of sharing the necessary resources to facilitate cooperative teaching thus increasing the existence of academia-service gap and/or theory-practice gap to develop. There was therefore a need to develop a model with guidelines for operationalisation of the model to facilitate collaboration <b>between</b> <b>institutions</b> of higher education and psychiatric health care services to promote psychiatric clinical nursing education. The research questions that emerged were: • What is the meaning of collaboration <b>between</b> <b>institutions</b> of higher education and psychiatric health care services within psychiatric clinical nursing education? • How can collaboration <b>between</b> <b>institutions</b> of higher education and psychiatric health care services be facilitated to promote psychiatric clinical nursing education? To realise the aim of this research, the following objectives are formulated: • to explore and describe the meaning of the concept “collaboration” <b>between</b> the <b>institutions</b> of higher education and psychiatric health care services within a psychiatric clinical educational context (theoretical and empirical perspectives); • to explore and describe the perceptions of nurse educators, nurse managers, and (i) clinical facilitators with regard to how collaboration <b>between</b> <b>institutions</b> of higher education and psychiatric health care services can be facilitated to promote psychiatric clinical nursing education; • to conceptualise the identified concepts of the model for collaboration to facilitate psychiatric clinical nursing education; • to describe the model to facilitate collaboration <b>between</b> <b>institutions</b> of higher education and psychiatric health care services, evaluate the model and describe guidelines for its operationalisation. The study was conducted in four phases. Phase One of the study involved an exploration and description of the meaning of collaboration within psychiatric clinical nursing education in accordance with Rodgers and Knafl’s evolutionary method of concept analysis (Rodgers & Knafl, 1993 : 77 - 90) and empirical meaning description from the participants’ perspective. Integration of the theoretical and empirical meaning of collaboration formed the basis on which a conceptual map was designed. Content analysis of literature was done using deductive and inductive reasoning strategies, synthesis, and inference and derivation as described by Chinn & Kramer (1995 : 63 - 67), and Walker and Avant, (1983 : 58 - 62). Theoretical validity was ensured (Chinn & Jacobs, 1987 : 208). A conceptual map constituting the four phases of collaboration was described...|$|R
