5|$|Another {{option is}} to {{classify}} selection by the life cycle stage at which it acts. Some biologists recognise just two types: viability (or survival) selection, which acts to increase an organism's probability of survival, and fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) selection, which acts to increase the rate of reproduction, given survival. Others split the life cycle into further components of selection. Thus viability and survival selection may be defined separately and respectively as acting to improve the probability of survival before and after <b>reproductive</b> <b>age</b> is reached, while fecundity selection may be split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, gametic selection, acting on gamete survival, and compatibility selection, acting on zygote formation.|$|E
5|$|Medullary bone tissue (endosteally derived, ephemeral, {{mineralization}} located {{inside the}} medulla {{of the long}} bones in gravid female birds) {{has been reported in}} at least one Allosaurus specimen, a shin bone from the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry. Today, this bone tissue is only formed in female birds that are laying eggs, as it is used to supply calcium to shells. Its presence in the Allosaurus individual has been used to establish sex and show it had reached <b>reproductive</b> <b>age.</b> However, other studies have called into question some cases of medullary bone in dinosaurs, including this Allosaurus individual. Data from extant birds suggested that the medullary bone in this Allosaurus individual may have been the result of a bone pathology instead. However, with the confirmation of medullary tissue indicating gender in a specimen of Tyrannosaurus, {{it may be possible to}} ascertain whether or not the Allosaurus in question was indeed female.|$|E
5|$|Another study corroborated {{the latter}} study's results but found {{the growth rate}} to be much faster, finding it to be around 1800 {{kilograms}} (4000lbs). Although these results were much higher than previous estimations, the authors noted that these results significantly lowered the great difference between its actual growth rate and the one which would be expected of an animal of its size. The sudden change in growth rate {{at the end of}} the growth spurt may indicate physical maturity, a hypothesis which is supported by the discovery of medullary tissue in the femur of a 16 to 20-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex from Montana (MOR 1125, also known as B-rex). Medullary tissue is found only in female birds during ovulation, indicating that B-rex was of <b>reproductive</b> <b>age.</b> Further study indicates an age of 18 for this specimen. In 2016, it was finally confirmed by Mary Higby Schweitzer and Lindsay Zanno et al that the soft tissue within the femur of MOR 1125 was medullary tissue. This also confirmed the identity of the specimen as a female. The discovery of medullary bone tissue within Tyrannosaurus may prove valuable in determining the sex of other dinosaur species in future examinations, as the chemical makeup of medullary tissue is unmistakable. Other tyrannosaurids exhibit extremely similar growth curves, although with lower growth rates corresponding to their lower adult sizes.|$|E

40|$|SummaryReproductive {{cessation}} {{is perhaps}} the earliest aging phenotype that humans experience. Similarly, reproduction of Caenorhabditis elegans ceases in mid-adulthood. Although somatic aging has been studied in both worms and humans, mechanisms regulating <b>reproductive</b> <b>aging</b> are not yet understood. Here, we show that TGF-β Sma/Mab and Insulin/IGF- 1 signaling regulate C. elegans <b>reproductive</b> <b>aging</b> by modulating multiple aspects of the reproductive process, including embryo integrity, oocyte fertilizability, chromosome segregation fidelity, DNA damage resistance, and oocyte and germline morphology. TGF-β activity regulates reproductive span and germline/oocyte quality noncell-autonomously and is temporally and transcriptionally separable from its regulation of growth. Chromosome segregation, cell cycle, and DNA damage response genes are upregulated in TGF-β mutant oocytes, decline in aged mammalian oocytes, and are critical for oocyte quality maintenance. Our data suggest that C. elegans and humans share many aspects of <b>reproductive</b> <b>aging,</b> including the correlation between <b>reproductive</b> <b>aging</b> and declining oocyte quality and mechanisms determining oocyte quality.

We analyse the shift of motherhood towards later <b>reproductive</b> <b>ages</b> during {{the last four decades}} and review its consequences for children and their mothers in low-fertility countries in Europe, North America, Oceania and East Asia.

We determine the effects of ‘stressful’ birth conditions on lifetime reproduction in a large semi-captive population of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus). We categorise birth month into stressful vs. not-stressful periods based on longitudinal measures of glucocorticoid metabolites in reproductive-aged females, which peak during heavy workload and the start of the monsoon in June-August. Females born in these months exhibit faster reproductive senescence in adulthood and have significantly reduced lifetime reproductive success than their counterparts born at other times of year.

40|$|Until recently, {{research}} concerning {{fertility and}} ageing has mainly been focused upon the female <b>reproductive</b> system. <b>Reproductive</b> <b>ageing</b> {{in the male}} is a less explored field, but increasing evidence suggests that paternal age is highly relevant to a couple’s fertility and the outcome of pregnancy. Studies have linked increased paternal age to longer time-topregnancy, more frequent spontaneous abortions and increased risk of certain diseases in the offspring, such as schizophrenia. The effects of male <b>reproductive</b> <b>ageing</b> are also getting more important, as the age of fathers-to-be is rising in our society. The aim of our {{study was to investigate}} the relationship between age and the sperm parameters DNA-fragmentation, DNA-stain-ability and rapid progressive motile spermatozoa. The population was 9835 men undergoing infertility evaluation at Rikshospitalet in the period 2004 - 2011. DNAfragmentation and rapid progressive motile spermatozoa were found to decline significantly with increasing age, while DNA-stain-ability was significantly rising. The analysis also suggests a more rapid change in DNA-fragmentation after the age of 45 years, which might be indicative of acceleration in male <b>reproductive</b> <b>ageing</b> with similarities to that found in women. This is an interesting finding and in accordance with some theories about ageing in general. Our study concludes that there is a relationship between paternal age and selected sperm parameters, but {{more research is needed to}} evaluate the mechanisms behind male <b>reproductive</b> <b>ageing</b> and its clinical consequences...|$|R
40|$|The early {{decline and}} loss of female {{fertility}} in humans and other species represents an evolutionary paradox. Despite being born with a vast stock of oocytes, females encounter an exhaustion of ovarian reserve and sterility half way through their natural lives. Female <b>reproductive</b> <b>ageing</b> has been proposed to proceed as an ongoing decline in ovarian reserve, determined by remaining ovarian follicle number. However, despite extensive modelling, the respective contributions of intra-, inter-, and extra-ovarian signalling have not been fully characterised. It remains unclear whether <b>reproductive</b> <b>ageing</b> progresses simply as a pre-determined function of remaining ovarian follicles, or as an age-dependent process in humans. Here, we have analysed ovarian response to hormonal stimulation in women who have undergone surgical removal of a single ovary, in order to investigate the relative contributions of intra-, inter, and extra-ovarian signalling on <b>reproductive</b> <b>ageing.</b> Our data show that in unilaterally oophorectomised women, ovarian response to follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) declines beyond levels predicted by a total ovarian follicle pool model of <b>reproductive</b> <b>ageing.</b> Maintenance of ovarian function later in reproductive life, despite the removal of half of the total ovarian reserve, suggests a role for an extra-ovarian age-dependent regulation of reproductive decline.

40|$|Menopause {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} age related declines in humans. Uncovering factors that influence <b>reproductive</b> <b>aging</b> is of interest with regard to human reproductive health, and is also an important first step in understanding the overall aging process. The Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite germline has been established as a highly-suitable model system, but many questions remain regarding the factors that modulate its aging. Although IF is well known to extend lifespan in a variety of species including C. elegans, less is known about its effect on <b>reproductive</b> <b>aging.</b> I show that IF can delay worm reproductive cessation without reducing brood size. As a first step in establishing means to understand the ways in which IF exerts its effects on <b>reproductive</b> <b>aging,</b> I characterize germline changes that occur as reproductive activity is modulated; I chose this approach because <b>reproductive</b> <b>aging</b> is likely to be linked to reproductive activity and to germline stem cell (GSC) activity. Specifically, I find that GSCs of individuals with low reproduction rates randomly occupy a dormant state in which they do not cycle. I also show that increasing reproduction rate alters germline compartment makeup, which occurs independently of oocyte fertilization. A strong candidate for regulation of at least some of these responses is the stem cell niche provided by the distal tip cell (DTC). Indeed, niche architecture has been hypothesized {{to play an important role}} in stem cell regulation. The DTC extends processes whose functional significance is unknown. Using time-lapse imaging, I show this growth to be an active and highly-dynamic process. This suggests that process growth may be an important component of the regulation of GSC behavior. Overall, I report striking, novel behaviors of the C. elegans reproductive system as a whole, and of GSCs in particular. I also report a new intervention by which reproductive cessation can be delayed without sacrificing brood size. This lays the foundation for future studies to identify the underlying causes of <b>reproductive</b> <b>aging,</b> and to identify ways in which this aging is intrinsically controlled and can be further manipulated by external intervention...|$|R
