40|$|Aim To {{identify}} whether {{intensive treatment}} and aftercare <b>telephone</b> <b>contacts</b> influence long-term abstinence {{and well-being of}} patients with alcohol dependency. Methods Six hundred and twenty two patients were evaluated {{at the beginning and}} end of intensive in-patient treatment. At the end of the treatment, the patients were divided into two recruitment cohorts – <b>telephone</b> <b>contact</b> group (n = 347), in whom basic outcome criteria (abstinence, marital and employment status, self-evaluation of well-being) were evaluated 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after intensive treatment and no contact group (n = 275) in whom the basic outcome criteria were checked only at 24 months after the intensive treatment. At 24 months, response rate was 33. 4 % in <b>telephone</b> <b>contact</b> group (n = 116) and 30. 5 % (n = 84) in no contact group. Results Positive indicators of therapy success (abstinence or decrease in drinking, stabile social relations, and more positive self-evaluation of well-being) were found in 53. 0 % of patients at 3 months, 44. 3 % at 6 months, and 30. 6 % at 12 months in <b>telephone</b> <b>contact</b> group. Overall abstinence 24 months after the end of intensive treatment was reported in 25. 7 % of all patients, including non-respondents. Both groups achieved significant improvement in subjective well-being during intensive treatment. At 24 months, 3 attributes of subjective well-being (subjective psychological health, evaluation of financial status, general quality of life) were significantly higher in <b>telephone</b> <b>contact</b> group. However, groups did not significantly differ in the abstinence level (<b>telephone</b> <b>contact</b> group = 27. 7 %, no contact group = 24. 4 %). Conclusion Significant differences in well-being variables between <b>telephone</b> <b>contact</b> group and no contact group at 24 months after the end of intensive treatment are at least partially due to phone contact/informative checking 3, 6, and 12 months after the end of intensive therapy. Telephone or any short and easy accessible communication checking is a promising as supportive and research tool in aftercare alcohol addiction treatment, especially because of its cost-benefit advantages...|$|R
