5|$|The final Test at the Oval {{was played}} {{in hot weather}} and Murdoch created a then-record score of 211, the first double-century in Test cricket. Murdoch was helped by three missed chances off the bowling of Ulyett when he had made 46, 171 and 205. England {{followed}} on but had only lost two wickets when time <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> the match was drawn.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, the Huntington Civic Arena was {{constructed}} on one parcel. One year later, {{a group of}} entrepreneurs wanted to construct a 350-room hotel and retail stores, however, the plan died by 1980. In 1983, the National Shamrock Development and Investment Company wanted to develop the property and took a two-year lease on the project. By mid-1985, however, the lease <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> the developers could not receive financial backing due to the failure in their $15 million Urban Development Action Grant request.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the living}} {{conditions}} of the Robinsons varied according {{to whether or not}} they had had time to prepare. There were roughly three days between the signing of the capitulation and the deadline for civilians to leave the city, during which those who made the decision to stay could stockpile food and water, and camouflage their hiding places. As time passed, supplies <b>ran</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> many Robinsons had to change their locations for security reasons. The situation soon became equally desperate for all who remained.|$|E

Not all of his scenes were filmed by the time his schedule <b>ran</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> he left the production despite the fact that Peter was to play a pivotal role in the then-unrecorded climax. His lines in {{the last half of the}} film were given to Ellery, whose character is never introduced, explained, or addressed by name.|$|E
5|$|Not {{wanting a}} tainted victory, Cena broke the hold and {{attacked}} Laurinaitis. As Cena {{returned to the}} ring, Punk performed a Go to Sleep on Cena and pinned him to win the WWE Championship. McMahon ordered {{the winner of the}} Raw Money in the Bank match, Alberto Del Rio, to cash in his contract on Punk. When Del Rio <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> tried to cash in his contract for an immediate WWE Championship match, Punk performed a roundhouse kick on Del Rio before he could do so. After blowing a kiss to a distraught McMahon, Punk fled the arena and left as WWE Champion.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{started the}} 195152 season poorly, scoring 9 and 5 against a full-strength New South Wales team. In the {{following}} match, he made 90 {{in the first}} innings as Queensland defeated the touring West Indies by ten wickets. Harvey was sidelined for six weeks before returning in late December against Victoria. He struggled in this match and the next against New South Wales, scoring 9, 20, 9 and 3. In the next match, he made 46 in the first innings before managing only five in the second, against South Australia. Nor did Queensland have success in these three matches. They were one wicket away from victory in the first match when time <b>ran</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> lost the other two. Harvey was dropped {{for the remainder of}} the season, ending with 196 runs at 21.77.|$|E

5|$|In 1766, John Gwynn {{complained in}} his work London and Westminster Improved {{that there was a}} lack of {{planning}} throughout the West End and that it would be useful to construct a thoroughfare linking Marylebone Park (now Regent's Park) with the Prince Regent's Carlton House. John Fordyce was appointed as Surveyor-General to the First Commissioner of Woods and Forests in 1793 and concluded that there should be a suitable road in place by 1811, when the lease for Marylebone Park <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> ownership reverted to the Crown. It was hoped the road could link Pall Mall and the Haymarket, of which has since declined in quality. A further problem was increased congestion around Charing Cross, which would benefit from road improvements.|$|E
5|$|On August 31, The Bella Twins {{announced}} {{they would be}} part of the all-female third season of NXT, mentoring Jamie. Jamie was the first rookie Diva eliminated on the October 5 episode of NXT. In November, the twins began a storyline with Daniel Bryan, when Brie accompanied him to the ring for his match. Following his win, Nikki <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> the two fought over Bryan's affection, until Bryan broke it up and had them hug each other. They began to manage Bryan and frequently accompanied him to the ring over the next two months. In January 2011, both Bellas turned into villainous characters, when they discovered Bryan kissing Gail Kim backstage and assaulted her. They continued to attack Kim, both at the Royal Rumble and on Raw, and on February 7, they teamed with Melina in a losing effort to Kim, Eve Torres, and Tamina.|$|E
5|$|Sweeping through Libreville unopposed, {{the troops}} easily {{captured}} the provincial council, though they met resistance at the Baraka {{military base in}} Lambaréné when they attacked at daylight. Upon learning of the impending attack, Aubame called Cousseran and asked him what had been going on. Cousseran dodged answering the question and requested that Aubame release M'ba uninjured. After receiving the false assurance from the ambassador that the French government {{had no intention of}} restoring M'ba to power, Aubame sent out a military officer to the countryside to find the deposed president. M'ba was moved to a small village near the Albert Schweitzer Hospital. At dawn on 19 February, French Air Force planes strafed the rebels at Baraka, while the French Army attacked the insurgents with machine gun fire and mortars. The rebels at the military base promptly surrendered once their ammunition supply <b>ran</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> their commander, Lieutenant Ndo Edou, was executed. Later, the French army managed to break through the gate to the village where M'ba was held and rescued the deposed president.|$|E

5|$|The {{scores were}} tied fifteen times, and {{at no point}} were the Australians more than five points in front. With six minutes {{to go in the}} final quarter, the Gliders were up by only two points, with the score 45–43. Crispin was sent to the free-throw line where she {{extended}} her team's lead to 47–43. A technical foul saw her straight back to the free-throw line to make it 48–43, the Gliders' biggest lead of the game. Brazil then struck back, scoring five unanswered points to tie the score again at 48–48, but Merritt scored one from the paint to put the Gliders back in front. She followed by taking a defensive rebound and then another shot to make it 52–48. Brazil scored once more, but time <b>ran</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> the Gliders won, 52–50. Leading scorers for the Gliders were Crispin with 18 points and Merritt with 16.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} quarter, the Australian defence {{remained}} strong, but their shooting did not improve. For the entire game, Crispin made only 3 out of 10 attempts, and Merritt just 4 out of 16. Nott, {{who played the}} entire game, ended up being the team's most accurate player, with {{four out of five}} attempts. Meanwhile, Team USA fought back to 40–39. Three timeouts were taken in the last minute. The game went down to the last seconds. Trailing 40-37 with less than 30 seconds to play, America's Desi Miller scored to have the USA trail by a point. Deliberately fouling Merrit put Miller out of the game, and sent Merritt to the free-throw line. It was a risk, but it paid off; Merritt missed both shots. The second was rebounded by Team USA's Rebecca Murray, who took the ball down the court, {{in the face of the}} Gliders' relentless defence. The ball was passed to Rose Hollermann, at 16 the youngest of Team USA's players. Spectators saw Hollermann's shot from the paint hit the ring with a second to go, but the shot clock was not reset. Team USA's Alana Nichols rebounded, and put the ball in the bucket, but not before time <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> a shot clock violation was called. This left Australia with possession. In another 1.9 seconds, it was all over, and Australia had a controversial one-point win.|$|E
5|$|When the 2016–17 season started, Harden {{was off to}} a great {{start and}} was widely {{considered}} a top MVP runner along with Kawhi Leonard plus former teammate Russell Westbrook. When the season ended, the Rockets were third in both the Western Conference and overall rankings, a major improvement from the season before. D'Antoni was named the NBA Coach of the Year, Eric Gordon the Sixth Man of the Year, and Harden finished second in MVP voting to Russell Westbrook. In the playoffs, the Rockets faced the sixth seeded Oklahoma City Thunder in a battle of the MVP frontrunners, as the winner was not announced until after the finals. The Rockets won the series 4–1 including Nene Hilario's perfect 12–12 in field goals in Game 4. But {{they went on to}} lose to the San Antonio Spurs in a six-game series, despite blowing out the Spurs in game 1 by 27 points. The Spurs tied the series 2-2 and held on to win game 5 as Manu Ginobili blocked James Harden's game tying three point attempt as time <b>ran</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> won game 6 by 39 points, as with Nene's injury, the Rockets could not guard Lamarcus Aldridge, who scored 34 points and grabbed 12 rebounds.|$|E
