40|$|Passive Evaporative Cooling is {{a method}} that uses the {{evaporation}} of water to cool the air. It is traditionally used and is most suitable in hot and dry climates. Its application {{is based on the}} availability of water resources and the creation of air movement through the building. The use of clay and porous ceramic in passive downdraught evaporative cooling has a track record in the vernacular architecture of hot and dry climatic regions. As part of this project, an improved design for porous ceramic evaporators has been developed for integration into a perimeter cavity wall system, as an alternative form of passive evaporative cooling. This research demonstrates that passive evaporative cooling using porous ceramic can provide thermal comfort conditions inside residential buildings in hot dry climates. Porous ceramic components can be integrated simply and effectively within existing housing of 1940 s to 1970 s which are due for refurbishment. Performance simulations on a case study building in Seville demonstrated that the system can provide comfort conditions after a series of energy saving strategies were applied to reduce cooling loads. An applicability study focusing on the residential stock of Seville assessed that the proposed system can avoid the need for mechanical cooling in 70 % of the existing buildings. This could result in substantial energy and CO 2 savings, contributing to Spain’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2010. An outline specification of a typical wall-integrated Porous Ceramic System (PCS) was set out and costed. A Life Cycle Cost analysis over 25 years compared the proposed PCS with a conventional <b>room</b> <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>unit,</b> demonstrating that its cost is half of the conventional option. The application of the proposed passive cooling system to apartment buildings in Southern European cities could considerably improve comfort and living conditions of the occupants, as well as reduce the use of room air-conditioning. If applied on a large scale, this could produce substantial energy savings and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Increase in cooling energy {{usage of}} the {{residential}} sector in Hong Kong has been moderate {{in the most recent}} ten years (2004 - 2013). Factors and drivers responsible for this are of interest to policy makers in search of performance improvement but such information is not available in extant literature. This paper reviews the policy instruments introduced in Hong Kong during this period of time and examines the different engineering factors contributing to improvements in cooling energy efficiency. Whether the policy instruments have been instrumental in bringing about changes in engineering design and thus improvement in cooling energy efficiency is evaluated {{on the basis of the}} equipment and building envelope characteristics of 64 residential developments in Hong Kong. Different statistical analyses reveal that the use of more energy efficient <b>room</b> <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>units</b> (COP), smaller window-to-wall ratios (WWR) and walls with higher U-values are the engineering factors (WallU) that have contributed to moderation of growth of energy consumption; these were driven by policies introduced by the Hong Kong Government. Regarding the sensitivity of the three engineering factors, it was found that COP was the highest amounting to 0. 455, followed in descending order by WallU and WWR. Their sensitivities were 0. 289 and 0. 006, respectively. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: As {{information}} and communications technology matures, {{the nature of}} the infrastructure that supports it evolves and specializes. While the telephone infrastructure had been built as a network with central offices acting as hubs, the {{information and}} communications technology maintains a similar structure, but instead, has hubs of specialized Internet data centers which house the routers and servers. This paper updates one of the first studies to document the electricity consumption and power distribution within an Internet data center. For this study, electricity billing data, metering data, and facility floor space allocation data were used to calculate computer room, total computer room, and building power densities for July 2002. The results of this 2002 study indicate that although the data center had expanded its operations by roughly 33 % from the previous year and increased the electricity demand associated with the computer equipment by 55 %, the total computer room power density �which includes cooling and auxiliary equipment � remained the same as the previous year at 355 W/m 2. The facility’s efforts to improve energy efficiency offset the energy demand from an increased, electrically active, computer room area. The energy-efficiency measures included better optimization of power distribution units, power management modules, computer <b>room</b> <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>units,</b> alterations to operating conditions, facilitywide reductions in lighting, and improved facility controls. A key recommendation is to expand this research to address the need to develop metrics to capture the energy efficiency of the data network throughput...|$|R
40|$|The sharp rise {{in energy}} usage in data centers, fueled by {{increased}} IT workload and high server density, and coupled with a concomitant increase in the cost and volatility of the energy supply, have triggered urgent calls to improve data center energy efficiency. In response, researchers have de-veloped energy-aware IT systems that slow or shut down servers without sacrificing performance objectives. Several authors have shown that utility functions are a natural and advantageous framework for self-management of servers to joint power and performance objectives. We demonstrate that utility functions are a similarly powerful framework for flexibly managing entire data centers to joint power and temperature objectives. After showing how utility functions can capture {{a wide range of}} objectives and tradeoffs that an operator might wish to specify, we illustrate the result-ing range in behavior and energy savings using experimental results from a real data center that is cooled by two com-puter <b>room</b> <b>air-conditioning</b> (CRAC) <b>units</b> equipped with variable-speed fan drives...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to perform {{simulation}} of airflow in lecture rooms using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technique.

Measurements were also done on the boundary parameters of the <b>room</b> such as <b>air-conditioning</b> inlet and outlet conditions.
