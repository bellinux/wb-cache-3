5|$|Inspired by Hirschfeld's {{work with}} the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, Gerber {{resolved}} to found a similar organization in the United States. He called his group the Society for Human Rights (the English translation of Bund für Menschenrecht) and took {{on the role of}} secretary. Gerber filed an application for a charter as a non-profit organization with the state of Illinois on December 10, 1924. The application outlined the goals and purposes of the Society: o promote and protect the interests of people who by reasons of mental and physical abnormalities are abused and hindered in the legal pursuit of happiness which is guaranteed them by the Declaration of Independence and to combat the public prejudices against them by dissemination of factors according to modern science among intellectuals of mature age. The Society stands only for law and order; it is in harmony with any and all general laws insofar as they protect the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> and does in no manner recommend any acts in violation of present laws nor advocate any manner inimical to the public welfare. An African American clergyman named John T. Graves signed on as president of the new organization and Gerber, Graves and five others were listed as directors. The state granted the charter on December 24, 1924, making the Society the oldest documented homosexual organization in the nation. Despite deliberately keeping the goals of the Society vague and excluding any mention of homosexuality from its mission statement, Society members were still surprised that no one with the state investigated any further before issuing the charter.|$|E

500|$|Literary critic John Kenneth Muir {{wrote that}} the Vidiians were {{an example of the}} {{prevalence}} of organ harvesting story arcs in science fiction, comparing them to characters in the British television shows UFO, , and Blake's 7. He also questioned the connection between storylines such as the Vidiians to the spread of urban legends involving organ trafficking. In his 2016 The Politics of Star Trek, political scientist George A. Gonzalez argued that the Vidiians served as a critique of realpolitik. He described the alien species as built on an [...] "intersubjective agreement that does not recognize the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> to their bodies/organs".|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Space Seed", Khan is {{presented}} as having several positive characteristics: he is gracious, smiling, fearless and generous. He is not threatened {{by the success of}} others, and encourages their self-esteem. He is also ambitious, desiring a challenge commensurate with his abilities, but this ambition is not tempered by any consideration of the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>others.</b> Author Paul Cantor asserts that Khan is a mirror image of Kirk, sharing his aggressiveness, ambition, and even his womanizing tendencies, but possessing them in far greater degree. During the episode, several of the characters express their admiration for the man even as they oppose him, with Kirk referring to him as [...] "the best of the tyrants, and the most dangerous." [...] The character's Spanish accent and superhuman appearance strongly differentiate him from most Star Trek characters.|$|E
500|$|In a major address, Grant stated: [...] "The {{building}} of rail-roads and the access thereby given {{to all the}} agricultural and mineral {{regions of the country}} is rapidly bringing civilized settlements into contact with all the tribes of indians. No matter what ought to be the relations between such settlements and the aborigines, the fact is they do not get on together, and one or the other has to give way in the end. A system which looks to the extinction of a race is too abhorant for a Nation to indulge in without without entailing upon the wrath of all Christendom, and without engendering in the Citizen a disregard for human life, and the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> dangerous to society.

500|$|In early 2007, the DePaul Political Science Department voted nine to three, and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Personnel Committee five to zero, {{in favor}} of giving Finkelstein tenure. The three {{opposing}} faculty members subsequently filed a minority report opposing tenure, supported by the Dean of the College, Chuck Suchar. Suchar stated he opposed tenure because Finkelstein's [...] "personal and reputation demeaning attacks on Dershowitz, Benny Morris, and the holocaust authors Elie Wiesel and Jerzy Kosinski" [...] were inconsistent with DePaul's [...] "Vincentian" [...] values; as examples of the latter, Suchar argued that Finkelstein lacked respect for [...] "the dignity of the individual" [...] and for [...] "the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> to hold and express different intellectual positions". Amidst considerable public debate, Dershowitz actively campaigned to block Finkelstein's tenure bid. In June 2007, a 4–3 vote by DePaul University's Board on Promotion and Tenure (a faculty board), affirmed by the university's president, the Rev. Dennis Holtschneider, denied Finkelstein tenure.|$|E
500|$|The {{school is}} {{run as a}} democracy, with {{students}} deciding affairs that range from the curriculum to the behavior code. Lessons are non-compulsory. Neill emphasizes [...] "self-regulation", personal responsibility, freedom from fear, [...] "freedom in sex play", and loving understanding over moral instruction or force. In his philosophy, all attempts to mold children are coercive in nature and therefore harmful. Caretakers are advised to [...] "trust" [...] in the natural process and let children self-regulate such that they live by their own rules and consequently treat with the highest respect the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> to live by their own rules. Neill's [...] "self-regulation" [...] constitutes a child's right to [...] "live freely, without outside authority in things psychic and somatic"—that children eat and come of age when they wants, are never hit, and are [...] "always loved and protected". Children can do as they please until their actions affect others. In an example, a student can skip French class to play music, but cannot disruptively play music during the French class. Against the popular image of [...] "go as you please schools", Summerhill has many rules. However, they are decided at a schoolwide meeting where students and teachers each have one vote apiece. This {{does not necessarily mean}} total cessation to the children, as Neill thought adults were right to bemoan child destruction of property. He considered this tension between adult and child living styles to be natural. Neill felt that most schoolwork and books kept children from their right to play, and that learning should only follow play and not be mixed [...] "to make [...] palatable". Neill found that those students interested in college would complete the prerequisites in two years and of their own volition.|$|E
2500|$|No. 10 {{addresses}} {{the question of}} how groups of citizens are formed, with interests contrary to the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> or the interests of the whole community. [...] Madison saw factions as inevitable {{due to the nature of}} man - that is, as long as men hold differing opinions, have differing amounts of wealth, and own differing amount of property, they will continue to form alliances with people who are most similar to them, and they will sometimes work against the public interest, and infringe upon the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>others.</b> Thus, he questions how to guard against those dangers.|$|E
