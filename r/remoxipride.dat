It has also been found to possess relatively low (virtually absent) potential to induce hyperprolactinaemia and extrapyramidal symptoms, likely attributable to its comparatively weak binding to (and, hence, rapid dissociation from) the D2 receptor.|$|E
40|$|Two {{hundred and}} forty-two {{patients}} with acute schizophrenia {{were enrolled in}} a double-blind, comparative, dose-finding study of a novel antipsychotic, <b>remoxipride.</b> <b>Remoxipride</b> was evaluated in a low (30 to 90 mg), medium (120 to 240 mg) and a high (300 to 600 mg) dose range and compared with a haloperidol (15 to 45 mg), which was administered to a similar group of patients. The results support the antipsychotic effect of <b>remoxipride,</b> with maximum efficacy occurring at daily doses between 120 mg and 600 mg. Side-effects were more frequent at doses of <b>remoxipride</b> over 300 mg. In all groups, <b>remoxipride</b> caused consistently fewer extrapyramidal side-effects than haloperidol. The antipsychotic effect of <b>remoxipride</b> may be derived from specific blockade of dopamine D 2 receptors in the mesolimbic tract. The findings also suggest that <b>remoxipride</b> may have a therapeutic effect on negative symptoms of schizophrenia...|$|E
40|$|A double-blind, {{randomized}} {{study of}} parallel group design comparing <b>remoxipride</b> and thioridazine (dose range 150 - 600 mg/day of either drug) was undertaken at 11 Australian centres. A total of 144 patients (<b>remoxipride</b> = 73, thioridazine = 71) with DSM-III-R schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder commenced the study, and 89 patients (<b>remoxipride</b> = 45, thioridazine = 44) completed the 6 {{weeks of the}} trial. The mean daily doses at last rating were 404 mg (<b>remoxipride)</b> and 378 mg (thioridazine). Initial Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores decreased by a mean 8. 7 points in both <b>remoxipride</b> and thioridazine groups. Equivalent treatment responses were also confirmed by Clinical Global Impression. During the study, sedatives or hypnotics were needed by 68 % of the <b>remoxipride</b> patients and 51 % of the thioridazine patients. Thioridazine was associated with more postural hypotension, drowsiness, increased sleep, headache, dizziness on rising, dry mouth, sexual dysfunction and weight gain, while <b>remoxipride</b> patients reported more insomnia. There were no differences between <b>remoxipride</b> and thioridazine on dystonia, hypokinesia, dyskinesia, rigidity and akathisia.

40|$|SUMMARY Single dose {{pharmacokinetics}} and the antipsychotic {{effect of}} 4 weeks treatment with three fixed dose levels of <b>remoxipride</b> (a selective D 2 receptor antagonist) were studied in chronic, stable schizophrenic inpatients. After a placebo washout of 1 month, 15 patients entered the study. Of these, 11 patients received a single 50 mg oral dose of <b>remoxipride</b> for pharmacokinetic evaluations. All 15 patients {{were randomly assigned}} to treatment with oral <b>remoxipride</b> either 25 mg t. i. d., 50 mg t. i. d. or 100 mg t. i. d. for 4 weeks. Blood samples for <b>remoxipride</b> and prolactin assays were taken at 0, 0. 33, 0. 5, 0. 66, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 24, 28, 32 and 48 h after drug intake. The pharmacokinetic characteristics were similar to those previously found in normal healthy volunteers: the mean peak plasma concentration of <b>remoxipride</b> after 50 mg was 3. 3 &mu;mol/l, the mean time to reach this was 2. 1 h; the mean area under the plasma concentration/time curve was 27. 8 &mu;mol/ 1. h. 1 - and the mean elimination half-life of <b>remoxipride</b> was 5. 5 h. A significant increase in prolactin levels was detected 2 h after administration of <b>remoxipride</b> but they had reverted to normal 8 h after drug intake in all but one patient. Antipsychotic effects were estimated using the brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS) and the Krawiecka rating scale (KRS) at admission, baseline (end of the 4 week placebo washout period) and after 7, 14 and 28 days treatment. Following an increase in mean psychosis ratings for both positive and negative symptoms during the placebo washout period, these decreased during active treatment {{and at the end of}} the study were similar to the scores on admission. Thus the possible efficacy of <b>remoxipride</b> in chronic patients with negative symptoms should be further explored in placebo controlled studies. <b>Remoxipride</b> was well tolerated. Sleep disorders occurred in three patients, extrapyramidal symptoms were not aggravated and no clinically significant effects were observed on the cardiovascular system, in clinical chemistry or haematology...|$|E
40|$|The {{antipsychotic}} {{effect of}} <b>remoxipride</b> {{was compared to}} that of haloperidol in a randomized double-blind study with parallel group design comprising 98 patients with schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder according to DSM-III. After a 3 - 7 day placebo washout period, patients received either 150 - 600 mg of <b>remoxipride</b> or 5 - 20 mg of haloperidol daily for 6 weeks. No significant differences in efficacy were found between the two treatments. Treatment-emergent checklist symptoms such as hypokinesia, rigidity, and tremor occurred more frequently and were more severe during haloperidol than during <b>remoxipride</b> treatment despite a significantly higher concurrent use of anticholinergic drugs in the haloperidol group. Haloperidol-treated patients reported greater increases in sleep and salivation than remoxipride-treated patients. Shoulder shaking and tremor were reported as occurring more frequently in the haloperidol group according to the Simpson and Angus rating scale for extrapyramidal symptoms. In summary, the two drugs seemed to be equally efficacious, though the tolerability profile favoured <b>remoxipride.</b> status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The in vivo {{effects of}} <b>remoxipride,</b> in {{relation}} to some of its identified metabolites, were investigated in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. The methods used included: (1) estimation of the in vivo rate of brain monoamine synthesis by measuring the accumulation of dihydroxyphenylalanine and 5 -hydroxytrypto-phan after decarboxylase inhibition; (2) observations of spon-taneous locomotor activity in a photocell-equipped open-field arena (' 0. 5 m 2); (3) treadmill locomotion (' 4 m min 21); (4) inclined grid (60 °) catalepsy test; (5) d-amphetamine-induced (1. 0 mg kg 21) hyperlocomotion;(6) quinpirole-induced (0. 4 mg kg 21) hypothermia. By use {{of one or more}} of these tests, the findings with <b>remoxipride</b> were as follows: First, <b>remoxipride</b> had a late onset of action (up to 3 h). Second, potency and efficacy depended on exposure to hepatic metabolism. Thus, intraperitoneal administration was more effective than the sub-cutaneous route, whereas virtually all biological effects were lost on intracerebroventricular administration.

40|$|Pharmaceutical {{formulations}} can {{be designed}} as Multiple Unit Systems, such as Roxiam CR, studied in this work. The dose is administrated as a capsule, which contains about 100 individual pellets, which in turn contain the active drug <b>remoxipride.</b> Experimental data for {{a large number of}} single pellets can be obtained by studying the release using microtitre plates. This makes it possible to study the release of the individual subunits making up the total dose. A mathematical model for simulating the release of <b>remoxipride</b> from single film-coated pellets is presented including internal and external mass transfer hindrance apart from the most important film resistance. The model can successfully simulate the release of <b>remoxipride</b> from single film-coated pellets if the lag phase of the experimental data is ignored. This was shown to have a minor influence on the release rate. The use of the present model is demonstrated by a parametric study showing that the release process is film-controlled, i. e. is limited by the mass transport through the polymer coating. The model was used to fit the film thickness and the drug loading to the experimental release data. The variation in the fitted values was similar to that obtained in the experiments...|$|E
40|$|Dopamine receptors are {{significantly}} involved in hippocampus-based cognitive processes. Whereas {{the involvement of}} D 1 -like receptors in hippocampal plasticity has been described, the role of D 2 -like receptors remains to be clarified. Therefore, we investigated the contribution of D 2 -like receptors to synaptic transmission, long-term potentiation (LTP) and depotentiation in the dentate gyrus of freely moving rats. Male Wistar rats underwent chronic implantation of a recording electrode in the granule cell layer, a stimulating electrode in the medial perforant path and a cannula in the ipsilateral cerebral ventricle (to enable drug administration). The D 2 -like receptor agonists quinpirole and noraporphine dose-dependently inhibited basal synaptic transmission. Agonist priming of D 2 -like receptors with a drug concentration which {{had no effect on}} synaptic transmission inhibited depotentiation but did not affect LTP. The agonist effects on depotentiation were prevented by the D 2 -like antagonist <b>remoxipride.</b> <b>Remoxipride</b> itself did not influence basal synaptic transmission or depotentiation. Interestingly, ‘weak ’ LTP ( 24 h) was inhibited by prior application of <b>remoxipride.</b> These results suggest a specific role for dopamine D 2 -like receptors in the regulation of both depotentiation and LTP in vivo and offer an important and novel insight as to the involvement of these receptors in processes related to learning and memory...|$|E
40|$|Dopaminergic agonists, such as {{apomorphine}} and amphetamine, {{have been}} shown to drastically reduce prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex. The effects of the indirect dopamine agonist cocaine on prepulse inhibition have only been described in a few reports and have yielded conflicting results, possibly due to individual differences within and between rat strains. In this study we therefore used apomorphine-susceptible and apomorphine-unsusceptible rats, as an animal model for individual differences, to study the effects of cocaine (20, 30 mg/kg i. p.) on prepulse inhibition. In addition we tested whether the cocaine-induced deficit in prepulse inhibition could be reversed by the D 2 -antagonist <b>remoxipride</b> (5 mg/kg i. p.), the alpha- 1 adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (2. 5 mg/kg i. p.) and the 5 -HT 2 -antagonist ketanserin (2. 0 mg/kg i. p.). Cocaine strongly reduced prepulse inhibition in apomorphine-susceptible rats, but had no effect at all on apomorphine-unsusceptible rats. <b>Remoxipride</b> had no effect on prepulse inhibition, but prazosin and ketanserin increased prepulse inhibition. Both <b>remoxipride</b> and prazosin reversed the cocaine-induced deficit in prepulse inhibition, whereas ketanserin did not. We conclude that apomorphine-susceptible rats are extremely sensitive to the effects of cocaine on prepulse inhibition, while apomorphine-unsusceptible rats are not. The effects of cocaine on prepulse inhibition in apomorphine-susceptible rats were mediated by D 2 -receptors, but not by 5 -HT 2 -receptors or alpha- 1 adrenoceptors...|$|E

40|$|For mechanism-based {{investigations}} on PK-PD relationships following intranasal administration, the use {{of advanced}} animal models and analytical techniques are crucial. As described in this thesis, quantitative information on distinction between extent as well as rate of absorption between nose-to-systemic and nose-to-brain distribution can now be obtained. Using plasma prolactin concentrations as a biomarker for dopamine D 2 inhibition, a mechanism-based PK-PD model was developed. Most important aspects in this approach were incorporation of target site exposure (brain extracellular fluid) of <b>remoxipride</b> and a biological system response (positive feedback) mechanism on the synthesis of prolactin, thereby increasing the mechanistic insight in modulation of the dopaminergic system in rats. Simulating <b>remoxipride</b> brain extracellular fluid concentrations in humans, allometric scaling and use of independent information on interspecies differences proved that the structural model is applicable in both rats and man.

40|$|The potencies of {{the major}} neuroleptics used in the {{treatment}} of schizophrenia, including haloperidol and <b>remoxipride,</b> correlate with their ability to bind D 2 -dopaminergic receptors in subcortical structures. On the other hand, the neuroleptic clozapine has a low affinity for these sites, and the pharmacological basis of its beneficial action is less clear. We have found that chronic treatment with clozapine, haloperidol, and <b>remoxipride</b> up-regulates D 2 receptors in specific cortical areas of the rhesus monkey frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. Of particular interest, all three neuroleptics down-regulated D 1 receptors in prefrontal and temporal association regions [...] the two areas most often associated with schizophrenia. This latter finding raises the possibility that down-regulation of D 1 receptors in prefrontal and temporal cortex may be {{an important component of the}} therapeutic response to neuroleptic drugs. Further, the common effects of three neuroleptics with different pharmacological profiles in the cerebral cortex is consistent with the idea that this structure is a major therapeutic target {{in the treatment of}} schizophrenia...|$|E

40|$|The {{roles of}} D 2 and D 1 dopaminergic receptors on the {{regulation}} of striatal acetylcholine (ACh) release in vivo were examined {{for a period of}} 120 min after acute (2 h) or prolonged (16 h) depletion of brain dopamine (DA) by alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine. The reduction of DA transmission did not affect basal ACh output after 2 h but markedly lowered ACh release by 16 h (50 %). Acute alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine pretreatment prevented the reduction of ACh release by the D 1 antagonist SCH 23390 and its increase by the D 2 antagonist, <b>remoxipride,</b> consistent with a drastic reduction of DA transmission at both DA receptors. However, 16 h after alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, the effect of <b>remoxipride</b> on ACh release was restored, but SCH 23390 still had no effect, suggesting that the D 2 inhibitory tone on ACh release had recovered, whereas the reduction of the D 1 facilitatory influence persisted. The D 1 facilitatory control of ACh neurotransmission thus appears to be more sensitive than the D 2 inhibitory control to a reduction in DA transmission. The new model of DA-ACh interaction resulting from these data casts fresh light on the relationship between changes in DA transmission and extrapyramidal motor function...|$|E

All compounds dose-dependently shortened {{the duration of the}} apomorphine-induced agitation and—with the exception of clozapine—shortened the onset of the de-arousal grooming that typically occurs immediately after the agitation phase has been terminated. Progressively higher doses were required to antagonize higher levels of apomorphine at earlier time intervals after the intravenous injection. The compounds also decreased palpebral opening, and most of them suppressed grooming behavior at higher doses. Compounds differed considerably in dose increments required for: 1) suppression of grooming, from 0. 33 for clozapine to. 600 for <b>remoxipride,</b> raclopride, and droperidol; 2) blockade of agitation at 5 minutes after apomorphine, from 2. 6 for pimozide to 165 for chlorprothixene and 254 for remoxipride; 3) mild decrease of palpebral opening, from 0. 21 for sertindole to 191 for remoxipride; and 4) pronounced de-crease of palpebral opening, from 10 for melperone to. 820 for raclopride. Only four compounds were able to advance grooming to 15 minutes postapomorphine, but again dose increments varied considerably: droperidol (3. 4), pimozide (9. 1), raclopride (42), and <b>remoxipride</b> (383). Based on these results obtained in a single animal model, compounds were differentiated in terms of behavioral specificity, incisiveness (the power to counteract the effects of progressively higher apomorphine concentra-tions), and sedative side-effect liability.

Two groups of healthy volunteers, a younger group (Y: six males and six females, aged 20 - 42 years) and an older group (0 : six males and eight females, aged 65 - 77 years) took part in a randomized double-blind three-period crossover study in which they received by mouth single doses of thioridazine (Y: 50 mg; 0 : 25 mg) <b>remoxipride</b> (Y: 100 mg; 0 : 50 mg) or placebo. Measures of central nervous system (CNS) and haemodynamic function were carried out before drug administration and at 1. 5 -h intervals up to 9 h post-dose, and blood samples were collected over a 24 -h period. No significant differences in dose-corrected pharmacokinetic variables were found between the two groups. There was evidence of marked CNS depressant effects of thioridazine from both objective and subjective measures. The effects for <b>remoxipride</b> were similar, though generally less marked. After allowance was made for dose, there was little indication of any difference in degree of CNS depression between the two age groups. Haemodynamic measures showed orthostatic reductions in blood pressure with thioridazine which were particularly marked in the older group, who also showed lower compensatory increases in pulse rate. These results indicate potential problems with orthostatic hypotension with thioridazine in older patients.

40|$|The potent {{anticonvulsant}} {{properties of}} neuropeptide Y (NPY) are generally {{attributed to a}} Y- 2 receptor-mediated inhibition of glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Independent {{studies have shown that}} NPY increases brain dopamine content, possibly via interaction with sigma 1 receptors. Recently, we showed that increased extracellular hippocampal dopamine attenuates pilocarpine-induced limbic seizures via activation of hippocampal D- 2 receptors. Our aim in this study was to elucidate the role of increased hippocampal dopamine in the mechanism of the anticonvulsant action of NPY and to investigate the involvement of Y- 2 and sigma 1 receptors in this process. Limbic seizures were evoked in freely moving rats by intrahippocampal administration of pilocarpine via a microdialysis probe. NPY was administered intracerebroventricularly, intrahippocampally via the microdialysis probe, or coadministered intrahippocampally with the D- 2 receptor antagonist <b>remoxipride,</b> the Y- 2 receptor antagonist BIIE 0246 or the sigma 1 receptor antagonist BD 1047. Changes in hippocampal extracellular dopamine were monitored, and behavioural changes indicative of seizure activity were scored. Intracerebroventricular (10 nmol/ 3 mu L) and intrahippocampal (20 - 50 mu M) NPY administration increased hippocampal dopamine and attenuated pilocarpine-induced seizures. Hippocampal D- 2 receptor blockade (4 mu M <b>remoxipride)</b> reversed the anticonvulsant effect of NPY. Y- 2 receptor blockade (1 mu M BIIE 0246) reversed the anticonvulsant effect of NPY but did not prevent NPY-induced increases in hippocampal dopamine. Sigma 1 receptor blockade (10 mu M BD 1047) abolished NPY-induced increases in hippocampal dopamine and reversed the anticonvulsant effect of NPY. Our results indicate that NPY-induced increases in hippocampal dopamine are mediated via sigma 1 receptors and contribute to the anticonvulsant effect of NPY via increased activation of hippocampal D- 2 receptors. This novel mechanism of anticonvulsant action of NPY is separate from, and may be complementary to, the well established Y- 2 receptor-mediated inhibition of hippocampal excitability...|$|E

The conventional antipsychotics moperone, timiperone etc. and the novel promising drugs YM- 09151, Y- 516, BMY- 14802 and <b>remoxipride</b> potently inhibited [(3) H] haloperidol binding with the Ki in the range of low to moderate nanomolar. On the other hand, among the other 27 drugs tested, the antispasmodics eperisone and tolperisone, the antiischemic agents ifenprodil, the Ca(2 +) antagonist flunarizine and cinnarizine, and the antitussives carbetapentane, cloperastine and dextromethorphan, were especially potent inhibitors. These results, taken together with the evidence that the antiischemic agents ifenprodil and dextromethorphan antagozine NMDA responses and NMDA receptor complex is a possible site of action for neuroprotective agents, strongly suggest that σ receptors may be potential sites of action for antiischemic as well as antipsychotic drugs, i. e., σ receptors mediate the neuroprotective effects of certain antiischemic agents by affecting the NMDA receptor complex...|$|E

Despite these modest apparent affinities, both compounds given orally to mice, nearly doubled steady-state tele-methylhistamine levels in brain, with ED 50 values {{as low as}} 1 and 3 mg/kg, respectively, an effect {{comparable to those of}} potent H 3 -receptor antagonists. This effect corresponded to an enhancement of histamine turnover rate from 45 to 73 ng/g/h as measured in the case of olanzapine using the pargyline test. Other antipsychotics displaying, such as clozapine and olanzapine, high 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) 2 A receptor antagonist potency, i. e., risperidone, thioridazine, seroquel, and iloperidone, also enhanced markedly tele-methylhistamine levels. This effect was 1) additive with that of a pure H 3 -receptor antagonist, ciproxifan, 2) mimicked by a 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonist, ketanserin, 3) reversed by a 5 -HT 2 A receptor agonist, DOI, 4) not shared by antipsychotics with low affinity for the 5 -HT 2 A receptor, i. e., haloperidol, sulpiride, raclopride, or <b>remoxipride</b> that, on the contrary, tended to reduce tele-methylhistamine levels. We conclude that in contrast to "typical" antipsychotics, "atypical" antipsychotics stimulate histamine neuron activity via blockade of the 5 -HT 2 A receptor in vivo. This effect does not appear to account for their reduced extrapyramidal side-effects but may underlie their pro-cognitive properties...|$|E
40|$|A common way to {{formulate}} controlled-release (CR) pharmaceuticals is to coat pellets of active substance with a polymer film, decrease {{the size of}} the pellets and distribute them as multiple-unit dosages in capsules. To increase the understanding of the release mechanism, the pellet shape and surface structure of pellets, before and after release in microtitre plates, have been studied by scanning electron microscope and X-ray energy-dispersive spectrometry. By performing these studies we associate release profiles during the first few hours to the microscopic structure. Pellets were divided into three classes (spherical pellets, dumbbell shaped pellets and twin-pellets) according to pellet form. Cases of burst release occurred for all three shape classes due to "open-window-defects" at the surface. Areas of thinner polymer film in the neck-region of dumbbell shaped pellets broaden the range of intermediate release rates for this pellet shape. The surface of twin pellets and dumbbell shaped pellets showed more defects, which increases the release rates in comparison to spherical pellets. All pellets with high release rates revealed ruptures in the polymer film, whereas only small cracks could be traced for pellets with slow release rates. The information gained is necessary for the development of future formulations and mathematical modelling of release patterns.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the involvement of}} glutamatergic neurotransmission in the modulation of D- 1 receptor-mediated stimulation of acetylcholine outflow in dorsal striatum in freely moving rats, and the relative roles of the thalamostriatal and corticostriatal pathways in this regulation using in vivo microdialysis. The selective n-methyl-D-aspartate non-competitive antagonist dizocilpine maleate (0. 1 mg/kg i. p.), but not the kainate/quisqualate receptor antagonist, 6, 7 -dinitroquinoxaline- 2, 3 -dione (3 mu g per side i. c. v.), completely prevented the rise in striatal extracellular acetylcholine elicited by maximal effective doses of the full D- 1 agonist SKF 82958 (3 mg/kg s. c.) and of the dopamine releaser d-amphetamine (2 mg/kg s. c.). Acute bilateral electrolytic lesions of the parafascicular nucleus of the thalamus prevented the stimulation of striatal acetylcholine output by SKF 82958 and d-amphetamine but only slightly reduced basal acetylcholine release. In contrast acute interruption of the corticostriatal pathway did not alter {{the effect of the}} two dopaminergic drugs although it markedly reduced basal striatal acetylcholine release. Lesions of the parafascicular thalamic nucleus, or a low dose of dizocilpine maleate (0. 1 mg/kg i. p.), also prevented the acetylcholine-increasing effect of the neuroleptic <b>remoxipride</b> (10 mg/kg s. c.), an effect known to be D- 1 receptor dependent. The results suggest that striatal projections arising from the parafascicular thalamic nucleus and utilizing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors {{play a critical role in}} the D- 1 -mediated stimulation of acetylcholine release in dorsal striata...|$|E
40|$|Intranasal (IN) {{administration}} {{could be an}} attractive mode of de-livery for drugs targeting the central nervous system, potentially providing a high bioavailability because of avoidance of a hepatic first-pass effect and rapid onset of action. However, controversy remains whether a direct transport route from the nasal cavity into the brain exists. Pharmacokinetic modeling is proposed to identify the existence of direct nose-to-brain transport in a quantitative manner. The selective dopamine-D 2 receptor antagonist remo-xipride was administered at different dosages, in freely moving rats, by the IN and intravenous (IV) route. Plasma and brain extra-cellular fluid (ECF) concentration-time profiles were obtained and simultaneously analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Brain ECF/plasma area under the curve ratios were 0. 28 and 0. 19 after IN and IV administration, respectively. A multicompartment pharmacokinetic model with two absorption compartments (nose-to-systemic and nose-to-brain) was found to best describe the observed pharmacokinetic data. Absorption was {{described in terms of}} bioavailability and rate. Total bioavailability after IN ad-ministration was 89 %, of which 75 % was attributed to direct nose-to brain transport. Direct nose-to-brain absorption rate was slow, explaining prolonged brain ECF exposure after IN compared with IV administration. These studies explicitly provide separation and quantitation of systemic and direct nose-to-brain transport after IN administration of <b>remoxipride</b> in the rat. Describing remo-xipride pharmacokinetics at the target site (brain ECF) in a semiphysiology-based manner would allow for better prediction of pharmacodynamic effects...|$|E
40|$|In anaesthetised male rats an {{intravenous}} (i. v.) {{injection of}} p-chloroamphetamine (PCA) produced a specific patterned bursting {{response in the}} sympathetic vas deferens nerve (VDN) that corresponds to ejaculation. In the present, study selective dopamine agonists and antagonists were used to investigate whether dopaminergic mechanisms influence the generation of this ejaculatory-related response. Administration of a mixed D 1 / 2 receptor agonist (0. 1 – 1. 0 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 apomorphine i. v.) also evoked the characteristic bursting pattern responses in the VDN. Similar, but fewer, burst pattern responses could also be evoked by a selective D 2 / 3 receptor agonist (0. 1 – 2. 0 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 piribedil). Responses to 1. 0 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 apomorphine were blocked by pretreatments with either 0. 5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 <b>remoxipride</b> (D 2 receptor antagonist) or 0. 5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 nafadotride (D 3 receptor antagonist), suggesting that D 2 -like receptors were involved. Responses could not be evoked by i. v. injections of apomorphine (1. 0 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) in anaesthetised male rats with a midthoracic spinal section, indicating that activation of D 2 -like receptors at supraspinal sites leads {{to an increase in}} the excitability of the lumbosacral pattern generator for ejaculation. In anaesthetised female rats a similar patterned bursting response occurred in the uterine nerve (UN) in response to apomorphine (0. 5 – 2. 0 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 [*]i. v.). Thus a common neural mechanism may regulate sexual climactic reflexes in both sexes...|$|E
40|$|Three conserved serine {{residues}} (Ser(193), Ser(194), and Ser(197)) in transmembrane spanning region (TM) V of the D- 2 dopamine receptor {{have been}} mutated to alanine, individually and in combination, {{to explore their}} role in ligand binding and G protein coupling. The multiple Ser [...] > Ala mutations {{had no effect on}} the binding of most antagonists tested, including [H- 3]spiperone, suggesting that the multiple mutations did not affect the overall conformation of the receptor protein. Double or triple mutants containing an Ala(197) mutation showed a decrease in affinity for domperidone, whereas Ala(193) mutants showed an increased affinity for a substituted benzamide, <b>remoxipride,</b> However, dopamine showed large decreases in affinity (> 20 -fold) for each multiple mutant receptor containing the Ser(193) Ala mutation, and the high-affinity (coupled) state of the receptor (in the absence of GTP) could not be detected for any of the multiple mutants. A series of monohydroxylated phenylethylamines and aminotetralins was tested for their binding to the native and multiple mutant D- 2 dopamine receptors. The results obtained suggest that Ser(193) interacts with the hydroxyl of S- 5 -hydroxy- 2 -dipropylaminotetralin (OH-DPAT) and Ser(197) with the hydroxyl of R- 5 -OH-DPAT. We predict that Ser(193) interacts with the hydroxyl of R- 7 -OH-DPAT and the 3 -hydroxyl (m-hydroxyl) of dopamine. Therefore, the conserved serine residues in TMV of the D- 2 dopamine receptor are involved in hydrogen bonding interactions with selected antagonists and most agonists tested and also enable agonists to stabilise receptor-G protein coupling...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacology}} of {{the acute}} hyperthermia that follows 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ‘ecstasy') administration to rats has been investigated. MDMA (12. 5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 i. p.) produced acute hyperthermia (measured rectally). The tail skin temperature did not increase, suggesting that MDMA may impair heat dissipation. Pretreatment with the 5 -HT 1 / 2 antagonist methysergide (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1), the 5 -HT 2 A antagonist MDL 100, 907 (0. 1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) or the 5 -HT 2 C antagonist SB 242084 (3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) failed {{to alter the}} hyperthermia. The 5 -HT 2 antagonist ritanserin (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) was without effect, but MDL 11, 939 (5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) blocked the hyperthermia, possibly because of activity at non-serotonergic receptors. The 5 -HT uptake inhibitor zimeldine (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) {{had no effect on}} MDMA-induced hyperthermia. The uptake inhibitor fluoxetine (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) markedly attenuated the MDMA-induced increase in hippocampal extracellular 5 -HT, also without altering hyperthermia. The dopamine D 2 antagonist <b>remoxipride</b> (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) did not alter MDMA-induced hyperthermia, but the D 1 antagonist SCH 23390 (0. 3 [*]–[*] 2. 0 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) dose-dependently antagonized it. The dopamine uptake inhibitor GBR 12909 (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) did not alter the hyperthermic response and microdialysis demonstrated that it did not inhibit MDMA-induced striatal dopamine release. These results demonstrate that in vivo MDMA-induced 5 -HT release is inhibited by 5 -HT uptake inhibitors, but MDMA-induced dopamine release may not be altered by a dopamine uptake inhibitor. It is suggested that MDMA-induced hyperthermia results not from MDMA-induced 5 -HT release, but rather from the increased release of dopamine that acts at D 1 receptors. This has implications for the clinical treatment of MDMA-induced hyperthermia...|$|E
40|$|Triadimefon (TDF) is a {{triazole}} fungicide {{that blocks}} the reuptake of dopamine (DA) {{and leads to}} increased locomotor activity levels in mice and rats, effects {{similar to those of}} indirect DA agonists such as cocaine. We recently found in mice that intermittent TDF administration led to robust locomotor sensitization, a phenomenon reflecting neuronal plasticity, following challenge with the same TDF dose after a 2 -week withdrawal period. The current study sought to determine whether antagonists to DA D 1 -like receptors (SCH 23390; SCH), DA D 2 -like receptors (remoxipride; Rem), ionotropic glutamate n-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (CPP), or ionotropic glutamate alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors (NBQX) could prevent the development of TDF behavioral sensitization, therefore indicating their mechanistic involvement in TDF sensitization. Mice were treated with either vehicle, SCH (0. 015 mg/kg), <b>remoxipride</b> (Rem, 0. 3 mg/kg), CPP (2. 5 mg/kg) or NBQX (10. 0 mg/kg), followed 30 min later by vehicle or 75 mg/kg TDF (TDF), twice a week for 7 weeks, with locomotor activity measured post-dosing once a week. After a 2 -week withdrawal period, mice were challenged with 75 mg/kg TDF or vehicle, to test for the presence of behavioral sensitization. Pretreatment with SCH, CPP, or NBQX, but not Rem, blocked the development of behavioral sensitization to TDF specifically for vertical activity. Antagonists that blocked TDF vertical sensitization also attenuated the increase in extracellular DA turnover (homovanillic acid [HVA]/DA) normally associated with this behavioral response. Therefore, DA D 1, NMDA and AMPA receptors appear to be necessary for the development of behavioral sensitization to TDF. As such, TDF may be considered an environmental risk factor for behavioral dysfunctions linked to glutamatergic and dopaminergic systems.

40|$|Objectives: Treatment with D 2 antagonists {{results in}} {{prolactin}} release, and thus prolactin is a biomarker of dopamine antagonism. We compare the model performance of two semi-mechanistic PKPD models, the pool {{model and the}} agonist-antagonist interaction model, to describe prolactin release following administration of risperidone (RI), paliperidone (PA) or <b>remoxipride</b> (REM) in rats. The hypothesis that potency differences exist for risperidone and paliperidone was evaluated and rat to human translations were conducted. Methods: The models were fitted to single or multiple dose data on the 3 paradigm compounds. Different potencies (EC 50 and KI) were estimated for RI and PA, as compared to a common potency. The pool model was modified to estimate RO 50, or the receptor occupancy at half-maximal effect, a system specific parameter. This was done using model predicted and observed KI values. As peripheral D 2 antagonism is responsible for prolactin release, free population plasma concentrations of the D 2 antagonists were considered as the drivers of the pharmacodynamic (PD) response. Finally, we predicted {{the time course of}} plasma prolactin in humans following PA administration, using an inter-species scaling approach. Results: Both models were able to describe the data and model performance was comparable. Potencies of RI and PA did not differ significantly. Estimated EC 50 for RI and PA was 35. 1 (relative standard error 51 %) and for REM it was 94. 8 (31 %) nM. KI values for these compounds were 14. 6 (17 %) and 165 (14 %) nM respectively. RO 50 was 28. 7 (21 %) %. System specific PD parameters were scaled using allometric principles, while RO 50 was assumed to be species independent. Predicted human plasma prolactin profiles were comparable with observed and published findings. Tachyphylaxis due to depletion of the prolactin pool was predicted after the second dose. Conclusions: The performance of both models was comparable in describing single and multiple dose data. Single dose typical human predictions with the pool model were in agreement with observed data...|$|E
