5|$|A crypt was {{constructed}} beneath the former Chapel of St. Anthony in 2009 {{to house the}} remains of former Bishops of Hong Kong. This consists of two Vicar Apostolics, Timoleon Raimondi and Dominic Pozzoni, and all five deceased bishops—Enrico Valtorta, Lorenzo Bianchi, Francis Hsu, Peter Lei and John Wu. Bianchi's remains were interred later than the others {{due to the fact}} that he was buried in Milan.

5|$|Despite the {{discovery}} of many hundreds of Iron Age sites in Scotland {{there is still a}} great deal that <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> explained {{about the nature of the}} Celtic life in the early Christian era. Unfortunately radiocarbon dating for this period is problematic and chronological sequences are poorly understood. For a variety of reasons much of the archaeological work to date in Scotland has concentrated on the islands of the west and north and both excavations and analysis of societal structures on the mainland are more limited in scope.|$|E

5|$|In chronic {{inflammatory}} {{diseases like}} atopic dermatitis (skin), rheumatoid arthritis (joints),…, {{the side effects}} of corticosteroids are problematic because of the necessary long-term treatment.

It <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen whether selective receptor agonists or modulators indeed cause significantly less side-effects than classical corticoids in clinical applications.|$|E

The burial of what now are {{considered}} to be Maria's and Alexei's <b>remains,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> with those of the family, was planned for 2015 but has been delayed mainly due to the insistence of the Russian Orthodox Church on more DNA-testing.|$|E

5|$|Prior to Pulos and Hutt's work, {{researchers}} were {{split on the}} mode of inheritance of white and whether it was deleterious (harmful).

5|$|The bulk {{properties}} of astatine {{are not known}} with any certainty. Research is limited by its short half-life, which prevents the creation of weighable quantities. A visible piece of astatine would immediately vaporize itself because of the heat generated by its intense radioactivity. It <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen if, with sufficient cooling, a macroscopic quantity of astatine could be deposited as a thin film. Astatine is usually classified as either a nonmetal or a metalloid; metal formation has also been predicted.|$|E
5|$|The {{burial of}} entire or cremated bodies at sea has been practised by {{countries}} around the world since ancient times, with instances recorded from the ancient civilisations in Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Practices vary by country and by religion; for example, the United States allows human <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> buried at sea at least 3 nautical miles from land, and if the remains are uncremated the water must be at least 600 feet deep, while in Islam burial by lowering a weighted clay vessel into the sea is permitted when a person dies on a ship.|$|E

5|$|A {{lingering}} controversy {{exists in}} ichthyology over {{the validity of}} the four species Beebe described on the basis of visual descriptions only, which he had observed during his Bathysphere dives. The naming of a new species ordinarily requires obtaining and analyzing a type specimen, something which was obviously impossible from inside the Bathysphere. Some of Beebe's critics claimed that these fish were illusions resulting from condensation on the Bathysphere's window, or even that Beebe willfully made them up, although the latter would have been strongly at odds with Beebe's reputation as an honest and rigorous scientist. While many of Beebe's observations from the Bathysphere have since been confirmed by advances in undersea photography, it is unclear whether others fit the description of any known sea animal. One possibility is that although these animals indeed exist, so much <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> discovered about life in the deep ocean that these animals have yet to be seen by anyone other than him.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Batman Forever, Warner Bros. started {{development}} on Batman & Robin, commissioning it on fast track for an adamant June 1997 release. Val Kilmer did not return, because of scheduling conflicts with The Saint, {{and was replaced by}} George Clooney. Arnold Schwarzenegger starred as Mr. Freeze, while Uma Thurman starred as Poison Ivy and Alicia Silverstone starred as Batgirl. Chris O'Donnell reprised his role as Robin. Principal photography began in September 1996 and finished in January 1997, two weeks ahead of the shooting schedule. Batman & Robin was released on June 20, 1997, and received primarily negative reviews. Observers criticized the film for its toyetic and campy approach, and for homosexual innuendos added by Schumacher. Still, the film was a financial success, but <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the least commercially successful live-action Batman film ever. Batman & Robin received numerous nominations at the Razzie Awards and ranks among the worst rated superhero films of all time.|$|E
