5|$|After being invaded, a queen may {{be forced}} to leave her nest. If a {{satellite}} has not been established, the queen may usurp another queen in a different nest. Thus not having to invest any valuable resources, the queen can then use these resources on <b>reproducing</b> a new brood.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches use pheromones {{to attract}} mates, and the males {{practice}} courtship rituals, such as posturing and stridulation. Like many insects, cockroaches mate {{facing away from}} each other with their genitalia in contact, and copulation can be prolonged. A few species are known to be parthenogenetic, <b>reproducing</b> without the need for males.|$|E

5|$|From the 1987 Momentary Lapse of Reason tour onwards, Wright and touring keyboardist Jon Carin favoured Kurzweil digital synthesizers, {{including}} the K2000 keyboard and K2000S rack module for <b>reproducing</b> piano and electric piano sounds.

5|$|The {{duplication}} {{and transmission}} of genetic material {{from one generation}} of cells to the next {{is the basis for}} molecular inheritance, and the link between the classical and molecular pictures of genes. Organisms inherit the characteristics of their parents because the cells of the offspring contain copies of the genes in their parents' cells. In asexually <b>reproducing</b> organisms, the offspring will be a genetic copy or clone of the parent organism. In sexually <b>reproducing</b> organisms, a specialized form of cell division called meiosis produces cells called gametes or germ cells that are haploid, or contain only one copy of each gene. The gametes produced by females are called eggs or ova, and those produced by males are called sperm. Two gametes fuse to form a diploid fertilized egg, a single cell that has two sets of genes, with one copy of each gene from the mother and one from the father.|$|E

5|$|Thrips are haplodiploid with haploid males (from unfertilised eggs, as in Hymenoptera) and diploid females {{capable of}} {{parthenogenesis}} (<b>reproducing</b> without fertilisation), many species using arrhenotoky, a few using thelytoky. The sex-determining bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia {{is a factor}} that affects the reproductive mode. Several normally bisexual species have become established in the United States with only females present.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann {{created the}} field of {{cellular}} automata {{without the aid of}} computers, constructing the first self-replicating automata with pencil and graph paper. The concept of the Von Neumann universal constructor based on the von Neumann cellular automaton was fleshed out in his posthumous work Theory of Self <b>Reproducing</b> Automata.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{differences}} in morphology and development are seen. In the desert locust and the migratory locust, for example, the gregaria nymphs become darker with strongly contrasting yellow and black markings, they grow larger, and have longer developmental periods. The adults are larger with different body proportions, less sexual dimorphism, and higher metabolic rates. They mature more rapidly and start <b>reproducing</b> earlier, but have {{lower levels of}} fecundity.|$|E

5|$|At {{the four}} corners of the wall sit towers (E) with {{intricate}} roofs boasting 72 ridges, <b>reproducing</b> the Pavilion of Prince Teng and the Yellow Crane Pavilion as they appeared in Song dynasty paintings. These towers are the most visible parts of the palace to commoners outside the walls, and much folklore is attached to them. According to one legend, artisans could not put a corner tower back together after it was dismantled for renovations in the early Qing dynasty, and it was only rebuilt after the intervention of carpenter-immortal Lu Ban.|$|E
5|$|Attachment is {{the binding}} {{of the virus}} to {{specific}} molecules {{on the surface of}} the cell. This specificity restricts the virus to a very limited type of cell. For example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects only human T cells, because its surface protein, gp120, can only react with CD4 and other molecules on the T cell's surface. Plant viruses can only attach to plant cells and cannot infect animals. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that only infect cells in which they are capable of <b>reproducing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>reproducing</b> readily {{in captivity}} {{and being the}} most populous lemur in zoos worldwide, {{numbering}} more than 2,000 individuals, the ring-tailed lemur is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List due to habitat destruction and hunting for bush meat and the exotic pet trade. As of early 2017, {{the population in the}} wild is believed to have crashed as low as 2,000 individuals due to habitat loss, poaching and hunting, making them far more critically endangered.|$|E

5|$|Hepatitis C {{is caused}} by an RNA virus. In 80% of people infected, the disease becomes chronic, and they remain {{infectious}} {{for the rest of}} their lives unless they are treated. There is an effective treatment that uses the nucleoside analogue drug ribavirin combined with interferon. Treatments for chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus by a similar strategy using lamivudine and other anti-viral drugs have been developed. In both diseases, the drugs stop the virus from <b>reproducing</b> and the interferon kills any remaining infected cells.|$|E
5|$|In a 1979 {{interview}} in The Videophile newsletter, Muntz revealed {{the biggest problem}} for the Stereo-Pak business was returned merchandise. He explained that when <b>reproducing</b> the work of major artists like The Beatles, the Stereo-Pak plant had to make {{hundreds of thousands of}} cartridges. But once a popular album became less popular, retailers would return the unsold cartridges, expecting credit towards new titles. Muntz was unprepared for the returns and said the huge cost of unsold merchandise eventually made his Stereo-Pak business unprofitable.|$|E
5|$|In {{the market}} for sculpture, plagued by fakes, {{the value of a}} piece {{increases}} significantly when its provenance can be established. A Rodin work with a verified history sold for US$4.8 million in 1999, and Rodin's bronze Eve, grand modeleâ version sans rocher sold for $18.9 million at a 2008 Christie's auction in New York. Art critics concerned about authenticity have argued that taking a cast does not equal <b>reproducing</b> a Rodin sculptureâ especially given the importance of surface treatment in Rodin's work.|$|E
