40|$|In microtomy, faults of {{the cutting}} edge are an obvious and avoidable source of artifact. The purpose of this {{communication}} is to describe a simple apparatus for viewing and marking {{the cutting edge}} of the glass knives which are used in seetioning for electron microscopy (1, 2). The apparatus consists of a monocular microscope with base, arm, body tube, coarse and fine adjustments, an annular incident light objective lens, and a <b>mechanical</b> <b>stage</b> that has been modified to hold a glass knife. The apparatus is illustrated in Text-fig. 1. The advantage of the annular incident light illumination is that rough surfaces reflect light into the objective and appear bright; an effect opposite to that obtained when strictly vertical illumination is used. A facet without faults appears as a narrow, white line in a dark field, while a faulty or dirty edge is a speckled, widened, or fissured white line. Three different knives are shown in Figs. 1 to 3. We have found a 50 × objective lens combined with a 15 × eyepiece satisfactory for discriminating between cutting edges. The glass knife is mounted vertically between a rigid pillar and thumb screw allowing adjustment of the angle of viewing. This vertical mounting together with the length of the objective lens make it necessary to increase the usual working distance between the objective lens and the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stage.</b> To that end a block was placed in the arm of the microscope above the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stage.</b> * This investigation was supported by Researc...|$|R

40|$|Extractive {{foraging}} requires {{animals to}} overcome the mechanical defenses of foods to obtain nutrition. However, resource extraction may entail distinct <b>mechanical</b> <b>stages</b> that each elicit different selection pressures. We test the hypothesis that tree gouging marmoset monkeys, Callithrix jacchus, preferentially gouge trees with fewer mechanical challenges to extracting exudates by examining three distinct stages of bark removal: 1) indentation, 2) crack initiation, and 3) crack propagation. By surveying trees gouged by wild marmosets in Pernambuco, Brazil, we found that trees with less mechanical challenges to crack initiation were gouged more intensely. Variables related to initial bark indentation and crack propagation showed no relationship to gouging behavior. However, marmoset craniofacial morphology displays specialized features that facilitate indentation and crack propagation during tree gouging, suggesting that marmosets {{use a combination of}} behavioral choice and morphological specializations to competently perform each <b>mechanical</b> <b>stage</b> in removing bark. Behavioral preference for less challenging resources likely allows marmosets to reduce costs and potential risks associated with extractive foraging.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{gravitropism}} is hindered {{by the fact}} that as a root responds, the gravitational stimulus changes. Using a feedback system to connect a rotating stage platform to a video digitizer system, we were able to maintain a constant angle of gravistimulation to Arabidopsis roots for long time periods. The rate of curvature approximated the sine rule for angles of stimulation between 20 ° and 120 °. For a given angle of stimulation, the rate of curvature also remained constant, with no observed diminishment of the response. Although previous reports of Arabidopsis root gravitropism suggest latent periods of approximately 30 min, using a smooth <b>mechanical</b> <b>stage</b> to reorient the root, we observed a mean time lag of approximately 10 min. This more rapid onset of curvature can, in part, be explained by reduced mechanical perturbation during the process of gravistimulation. This suggests that mechanical stimulation associated with rapid root re-orientation may confound investigations of early gravitropic events...|$|R
40|$|A laser {{tweezers}} {{system for}} transporting dissociated neurons into small “cages” on a culture dish was constructed, {{and it was}} studied extensively. The system consists of an inverted microscope, a 1064 nm or 980 nm laser module, a beam expander, a motorized <b>mechanical</b> <b>stage,</b> a CCD camera, and steering mirrors. A laser beam is generated by the IR laser module, and the beam is expanded by the beam expander to match {{the size of the}} back aperture of the objective. The beam is then steered into the objective where it is focused to a point. The system uses this single, tightly focused laser beam to trap a neuron. Once a neuron is trapped and lifted, the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stage</b> is moved to locate the neuron above its destination. The system will know the location of the neurocages and will automatically move neurons to their destination. Newly dissociated neurons will attach to most substrate surfaces eagerly, and the lifting of a neuron is impossible when it is attached to the surface. Many possible surfaces were investigated, and it was discovered that the surface can best be made “non-sticky” for more than an hour, by coating the surface with Poly- 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate (PolyHEMA). The neural survival at different laser intensities, exposure times, and wavelengths were studied. The results show that neural survival depends strongly on laser wavelengths, and a 980 nm laser is less damaging than a 1064 nm laser. For 980 nm, perfect survival after irradiation is independent of laser power up to our maximum of 130 mW for exposure time up to 4 minutes. At 17 mW, almost all neurons can be lifted off a PolyHEMA substrate. The maximum speed for moving a neuron through the medium at different laser intensities was studied, and was 250 um/s at 100 mW for 980 nm. The studies have shown that a laser tweezers system is suitable for transporting live dissociated neurons over millimeter distance in less than a minute. The neural survival in neurocages on glass substrate was then studied. The survival and growth over time for neurons loaded into cages was found to be no different than for that of a control culture...|$|R
40|$|Citation: White, Clarence H. The tensile {{strength}} of wool. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1905. Introduction: It is my purpose {{in this experiment}} to attempt to demonstrate the {{tensile strength}} of single wool fibers from four of the chief breeds, viz. Cotswold, Shropshire, Southdown, and the Rambouillet. Samples {{from different parts of}} the body were also compared. The apparatus used consisted of two jolly balances, a compound microscope with ocular or eye piece, micrometer, small forceps, <b>mechanical</b> <b>stage,</b> and other microscopic equipment. Two jolly balances were used because of the wide variation between the Cotswold and Rambouillet wools, the Cotswold fibers being so strong that a special balance with an extra strong spring or coil was required. The test was begun by first determining the constant of each balance, which was done by making the zero reading and then noting the displacement caused by a weight of one gram. Next a wool fiber was fastened on the hook of the balance by knotting one and half-hitching. The tensile strength was then easily read in grams by simply pulling down on the fiber until it broke, the reading being made just at the moment the fiber parted. No particular length of fiber was used as the weight of a single fiber is so very slight that it was concluded the results would not be influenced. The only opportunity for a variation might be based on the cry that in a greater length the chances for weak points are greater. No objection can be raised on account of this theory, however, because a thread is no stronger than its weakest point. This last statement might also be sited as a reason for testing many fibers and each but one. In connection with obtaining the strength of each fiber the diameter was also taken as {{it was found that the}} strength varied directly with the diameter. For the purpose of measuring the diameters, the fibers were fastened on a glass slide by means of balsam and cover slips. In this condition the fibers were held firm and straight, so that with the aid of a micrometer–microscope and <b>mechanical</b> <b>stage</b> the diameter was very easily determined...|$|R

The authors present data showing changes in the FE coordinates of individual PZT grains and correlate these changes to stress-strain data, which plot the macroscopic evolution of the FE-to-AFE transformation.
