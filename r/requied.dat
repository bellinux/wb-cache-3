40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we address {{the design of a}} packet buffer for future {{high-speed}} routers that support line rates as high as OC- 3072 (160 Gb/s), and a high number of ports and service classes. We describe a general design for hybrid DRAM/SRAM packet buffers that exploits bank organization of DRAM. This novel General Hybrid DRAM/SRAM Architecture includes some designs previously proposed as particular cases. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm that randomly chooses a DRAM memory bank for every transfer between SRAM and DRAM. The numerical results show that not only the <b>requied</b> SRAM size should be almost an order of magnitude lower than previously proposed schemes, but also DRAM does not have the problem of fragmentation.

40|$|We {{identify}} displaced periodic orbits in {{the circular}} restricted three-body problem, wher the third (small) {{body is a}} solar sail. In particular, we consider solar sail orbits in the earth-sun system which are high above the exliptic plane. It is shown that periodic orbits about surfaces of artificial equilibria are naturally present at linear order. Using the method of Lindstedt-Poincare, we construct nth order approximations to periodic solutions of the nonlinear equations of motion. In {{the second part of}} the paper we generalize to the solar sail elliptical restricted three-body problem. A numerical continuation, with the eccentricity, e, as the varying parameter, is used to find periodic orbits above the ecliptic, starting from a known orbit at e= 0 and continuing to the <b>requied</b> eccentricity of e= 0. 0167.

40|$|One major {{trend in}} modern cancer ther-apy {{is to develop}} drugs that target a spe-cific {{signaling}} pathway, aimed at achieving the selective killing of cancer cells with reduced side effects for normal tissues. Examples of this trend include inhibitors of the oncogenic protein kinases, ERBB 2 (HER 2) and BCR-ABL, which interfere with hyperactivated survival signaling. Such selective (“clean”) inhibitors are ini-tially quite effective. However, the long-term use of these compounds is often limited by the acquisition of resistance, either upon the mutation of drug targets or by other bypass mechanisms that cancer cells develop {{in response to this}} selective pressure. In contrast, pleiotropic (“dirty”) drugs simultaneously affect several regula-tory pathways that are <b>requied</b> for the sur-vival of cancer cells, thus being less prone to generate resistance.

Membrane expression of the delta 15, delta 34, delta 43, and delta 34 - 43 mutants was similar; however, expression of deltatail was lost, as was agonist-mediated internalisation of deltatail, delta 43, and delta 34 - 43. Additionally, trypsin and SLIGKV-stimulated [3 H]IP accumulation was abrogated in cells transiently expressing delta 43 or delta 34 - 43 truncations, but remained unaffected in cells expressing delta 34 or delta 15. PAR- 2 agonist-stimulated intracellular Ca(2 +) mobilisation and PYK- 2 activity were also abolished by deltatail, delta 43, and delta 34 - 43 mutants. However, trypsin-stimulated stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activities were unaffected by the delta 34 - 43 mutation, although activity was abrogated following delta 43 or deltatail truncations, suggesting that Ca(2 +) mobilisation, PYK- 2, or receptor internalisation are not <b>requied</b> for activation of SAPKs or ERK.

Response Surface Methodology (RSM). has been applied for developing models in the form of multiple regression equations correlating dependent parameters with cutting parameters and radius chip breaker, in a turning process.

In this paper, I intend to argue the necessity for reconstruction of the standpoints of School Education and to make clear the perspectives on this topic according to the Japanese situations. The main remarks of this are as follows. (1) In Japan, nowadays, so many problems of the school education are illuminated out in verious aspects. But, those problems are to be solved as a whole problem of education and they are, in deed, requiring more practical procedures {{in order to do}} so. (2) One of the procedures is so-called the Shift to the Lifelong Learning System and it is needed to reconstruct the previous standpoints of school education to realize it. Namely, the reconstruction has two elements, vertical integration and horizontal integration. (3) The school education is a most important subsystem to form the Lifelong Learning System and that to be <b>requied</b> now is to recover or reconstruct the wholeness and circulation of educations on the verious places in the society. (4) In addition, the new role and vision of the compulsory education which is forced to refine its meanings will be led through it.

Moreover, the bactericidal effect was studied from the viewpoint of action time of disinfectants. The following results were obtained. 1) As for {{the relation between}} the effect on respiration and the bactericidal action, a marked inhibition on the respiration of bacteria was observed by commonly used disinfectant in such dilution as it could render bactericidal effect. Both the bactericidal effect and the inhibition on respiration were more severe at the disinfectant that had the effect even in higher dilutions. 2) On the test using aureomycin, it did not render bactericidal effect at all at the concentration that the respiration was inhibited almost completely. Hence aureomycin should have worked bacteriostatically. 3) In the case of macramin a severe inhibition on the respiration was found in a fairly high dilution. However, the bactericidal effect could not observe at the minimal dilution that could inhibit the respiration almost completely, and only slight innibition of growth of bacteria was found at that dilution. 4) The relative bactericidal effect of disinfectants found to be comparable each other by means of the minimal action time <b>requied</b> to kill the organism in the minimal concentration that rendered the inhibition on respiration of the bacteria...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of nandrolone decanoate on lipid profile in chronic hemodialysis patients. "nMaterials and Methods: thirty six stable male patients over 40 years who were under maintenance hemodialysis were randomized to receive nandrolone decanoate, 100 mg weekly for six month, by intramuscular injection on nondialysis day (Group A, N= 18) or B complex (Group B, N= 18). Between September 2001 and 2002, male hemodialysis patients more than 40 years old without history of high prostatic specific antigen (PAS) or sensitization to drug were started on treatment with androgen therapy. The evolution in the liquid profile was prospectively assessed immediately before the first dose of nandrolone decanoate (basal values) and at 2, 4 and 6 month of therapy. The evolution of lipids after withdrawal of androgens at 2 month after the last dose was also studied. The patients underwent hemodialysis 3 to 4 hours three times a week. The dialysis schedule was not modified during the period of study. "nResults: Mean decrease of LP(a) level in group A was significantly lower then group B in second month (p&lt; 0. 05). Surprisingly HP level decreased also in second month. Other lipid parameters did not show significant changes. "nConclusion: In this study we observed that nandrolone decanoate affects on LP(a) leveK but the changes of it did not correlate with those of hemoglobin or other lipid parameters&lt; suggesting that the underlying mechanisms are unrelated.
