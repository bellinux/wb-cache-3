25|$|Following {{the release}} of Miranda by <b>Research</b> <b>Software</b> Ltd, in 1985, {{interest}} in lazy functional languages grew. By 1987, {{more than a dozen}} non-strict, purely functional programming languages existed. Miranda was the most widely used, but it was proprietary software. At the conference on Functional Programming Languages and Computer Architecture (FPCA '87) in Portland, Oregon, there was a strong consensus that a committee be formed to define an open standard for such languages. The committee's purpose was to consolidate existing functional languages into a common one to serve as a basis for future research in functional-language design.|$|E

During this process the analysis of alternative image tagging systems was performed, as well as gathering system requirements. When the system was developed, there was made a <b>research</b> to determine <b>software</b> quality. There was made three types of researches: <b>research</b> of <b>software</b> functionality, <b>research</b> of <b>software</b> quality to fit ISO 9126 standard and research of using DB objects.

50|$|Entries in the ASCL are indexed by the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) and Web of Science's Data Citation Index {{and because}} each code is {{assigned}} a unique ascl ID, software can be cited {{in a journal}} paper even {{when there is no}} citable paper describing the code. Web of Science and ADS indexing makes <b>research</b> <b>software</b> more discoverable. Additionally, ADS can link some papers which use codes to the code entries, which makes it easier to examine the computational methods used. ADS also tracks citations for software (assuming the citations are formatted correctly), which can help <b>research</b> <b>software</b> authors for whom citation rates are an important measure.|$|E
