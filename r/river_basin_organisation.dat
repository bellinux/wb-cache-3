40|$|This article {{identifies}} {{determinants of}} the decentralisation processes and performances of river basin management decentralisation in Sub-Saharan Africa, using an institutional analysis framework applied to primary data from twenty-seven river basins in the region. Main {{findings suggest that}} water scarcity is a major stimulus to the reform; that water user associations, if not well prepared and trained, may deter the decentralisation process and being part of an existing treaty over an international basin helps foster the process for domestic basins {{that are part of}} an international basin. Conditions improving decentralisation process performance include: scarcity of water resources, longer period of implementation, bottom-up creation and appropriate budgetary support of the <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> <b>organisation.</b> Due to the sample size our findings can be seen as suggestive for decentralisation policy in remaining river basins across the continent and elsewhere.

40|$|The {{revival of}} {{plans to build}} up to 11 {{hydropower}} dams on the Lower Mekong mainstream focuses attention on the Mekong River Commission (MRC), an international <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> <b>organisation</b> assigned {{with the task of}} ensuring the sustainable use and management of water and related resources of the Lower Mekong Basin. Although questions regarding MRC’s role have been posed since its inception, the proposed mainstream dams signal an especially critical time for MRC. How MRC addresses key concerns and balances different interests in the basin will have signifi cant bearing on MRC’s perceived relevance to its member states, donors and the people of the basin. This report focuses on two aspects of MRC’s structure and activities in relation to mainstream dams: its governance role and its role as a knowledge-based organisation. In regard to governance, MRC asserts that it is an intergovernmental organisation, not a supranational one and, as such, its role is primarily to serve its member states. This position calls for a better understanding of MRC power and responsibilities, and whose interests the MRC serves. MRC’s governance structure has implications for a <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> <b>organisation</b> that portrays itself as an independent producer of knowledge and science. There are many areas of knowledge in which MRC can use its science to help manage and develop the river more equitably and sustainably. This report reviews MRC’s fi sheries research and modelling of development scenarios and examines how MRC acts on its knowledge base to infl uence planning and decision making on mainstream dams. The final section examines the responsiveness of MRC to the wider basin community and the opportunities and challenges arising from its recent efforts to engage various stakeholders more actively. Drawing heavily on MRC’s own research and statements, this report seeks to inform and open discussions regarding MRC’s role in relation to the proposed lower mainstream dams.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{hydropower}} {{development in}} the lower Mekong basin. Water resources development is promoted and contested by multiple actors at multiple scalar levels of analysis. In examining the hydropolitical constellation of the lower Mekong theoretical insights from political ecology are utilised, and dominant assumptions about transboundary rivers are considered. The hydropolitical constellation of the lower Mekong is comprised {{of a number of}} different actors with competing water resources development agendas, including: the Mekong River Commission, multilateral development banks, donors, the private sector, and civil society. The Mekong River Commission, as a transboundary <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> <b>organisation,</b> is a key arena for hydropower development debates as it is a space where a multitude of actors interact and confront each other. This thesis argues that a dominant development narrative linking hydropower development and poverty reduction has endured since the 1950 s. This narrative was the initial impetus for transboundary water cooperation between the four lower Mekong states. From the 1990 s onwards the pace of hydropower {{development in the}} lower Mekong has increased and is being intensified by new actors. Changing regional dynamics and the presence of new actors has altered power relationships, but not dominant conceptions of the Mekong and hydropower. This thesis argues that actors utilise narratives to legitimise their development interventions and silence the concerns of less powerful actors. Situating hydropower development at the national scale obscures actors, processes and impacts at other levels of analysis which are promoting and contesting hydropower development. Representing the Mekong and development in particular ways allows actors to maintain and extend their access to resources. However, this is continually challenged by less powerful actors. The evidence and representations of less powerful actors have been unable to displace those of powerful actors who have shifted the terrain to discussions of trade-offs.

40|$|Decentralisation is an {{important}} element of the discourse on integrated water resources management. A key assumption is that the organisation of water resources management on the level of (sub-) basins offers good possibilities to involve stakeholders and to coordinate their interests. Although there are ample examples of decentralisation in water resources management, most notably of the establishment of <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> <b>organisations,</b> the practice of implementation remains difficult. Drawing on the results of two international research projects, on transitions in water resources management and on the foundation of <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> <b>organisations,</b> we discuss six potential explanations for the troublesome implementation of decentralisation in water resources management: (1) the path dependent development of institutions, (2) the two-level game of decentralisation, (3) institutional competition, (4) poor interplay between newly established and pre-existing institutions, (5) the risk of a pendular movement in which absence of short term successes leads to centralisation again, and (6) the lack of institutional capacity on local and/or regional levels. Finally, recommendations are made for those involved in decentralisation processes...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the focus was}} on the {{importance}} of identifying the drivers, processes and outcomes of transboundary water management in Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) and to establish the relationship with regional integration in SADC. It aimed to present a dimension to a basic typology of regional integration by studying the Limpopo basin transboundary water management in a SADC context. Transboundary water management was taken as a sector approach adopted in SADC regional integration. The objectives of the study were to analyse transboundary water management in SADC through the Limpopo Agreement of 2003; to establish the relationship of the Limpopo Basinâ€™s transboundary water management and regional integration in SADC; to analyse the influence of international forces on regional water governance trends; and to investigate the impact of river basin organizations on regional peace, security and sustainable development. The hypothesis in this study was that transboundary water management in the Limpopo Basin is an opportunity to understand regional integration in SADC. The methodology of study evolved on an issues based approach framed in defining driving forces and pressures (rational) and outlining impacts on states and the responses which have been manifest through various interstate agreements. It traces the movement from bilateral to multilateral cooperation usually in the form of river basin organisations. However, it is noted that bilateral agreements between states continue to be relevant in defining context specific solutions. The research hinged on locating governance and socio economic factors. Governance was about its architecture, <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> <b>organisation</b> resilience and water legislation. Socio economic indicators are linked to economic interdependency, societal well-being and vulnerability. The study enables the identification and explanation of principles, concepts and instruments in the Limpopo basin agreements and SADC regional water sector. Subsequently, state sovereignty has been challenged in SADC through transboundary water management. Comparative approaches are taken from the historical legacies of commission operation of the Permanent Indus Commission, the Niger River Authority and the International Commission for the Protection of the River Elbe. Apparently the major lessons arrived at are that transboundary water management is useful in consensus building and presents opportunities for cooperation, development and integration rather than to conflict. It is concluded that the immense value of Limpopo Watercourse Commission (LIMCOM) is still futuristic although it represents efforts and growth towards regional integration. It is recommended that SADC and LIMCOM can {{play an important role in}} securing and maintaining a commitment to best practices, cost-effective management, democracy and stability from which greater regional co-operation and thus global integration can be launched. The stability of the region is seen as critical to the success of its own transition...|$|E
40|$|The Vietnamese Government has {{endorsed}} a community-based integrated approach to resource management. This approach {{is based on}} a collaborative partnership between government and the community, and as such involves multiple stakeholders with different and often conflicting objectives. My research examines the challenges involved in this approach and the opportunities to effectively engage various stakeholders. It will address the problem of decentralisation in water resource management and adaptive governance by government agencies. Integrated catchment management (ICM) is explored as the core concept throughout the research. The research looks into a number of activities undertaken by local institutions in Quang Nam Province, Vietnam, to adopt centralised strategies in water resource management and adaptive governance at a local level. The thesis investigates how central policies could be localised, and conversely, how local needs could be reflected in the central policy making process. These issues are explored through studying the process of river catchment management, including the water allocation between agricultural use and hydroelectricity generation, along with water distribution in local irrigation systems. The research applies a combination of multiple analysis methods: stakeholder, qualitative and economic, and institutional analysis. The analysis identifies the continuing gaps between the theory and practice of ICM in a complex situation of Vietnam’s developing economy, its huge natural resources potential, ancient bureaucracy and unique political context. It identifies the absence of coordination between hydroelectricity development and sustainable catchment management. For instance, there is no representative from the main water users, the hydroelectricity plants and rice farmers, on the <b>River</b> <b>Basin</b> <b>Organisation.</b> Local authorities also have no action in stimulating collective action in the community. The social capital of the main actors in local water management is evaluated to identify the potential benefits of participation in the Integrated Catchment Management and incentives needed for action to be taken. The connection of institutional and relational capital is demonstrated a strategy of decentralisation. The issue of scale-up management by water users is examined in the Vietnamese current legislative and policy framework. Selection of the right organisation model for local irrigation management is important in order to stimulate the local users to participate in ICM. Recommendations are made as to the most appropriate framework including mechanisms for water sharing among users in the catchment, a catchment authority with representation of main users on the advisory board, self-finance sustainability for water service providers, and incentives for farming users in the catchment management. The thesis will also show the important role of government agencies in facilitating this framework...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} thesis {{will explore}} {{the relationship between}} integrated water resource management (IWRM), water conflict and cooperation within the Mekong River Basin and {{the capacity of the}} Mekong River Commission (MRC) to influence water governance in a rapidly evolving region. The paper will also analyse the historical evolution of the MRC and its role and influence on regional water governance within a highly complex geopolitical landscape. Based on a comparative analysis of the MRC's response to two large-scale water related infrastructure investments the paper will also assess its institutional capacity to mitigate and mediate transboundary conflict. The paper will then explore ways by which the MRC could become more relevant and effective in its role of mitigating and mediating transboundary water related conflict within the changing Mekong waterscape. The Mekong River starts in Tibet and journeys 4, 000 kilometres through Southeast Asia until it reaches the South China Sea in Vietnam. It is of vital importance for national economic development of Upper and Lower Mekong countries whilst also being integral for the subsistence livelihoods of millions of rural poor reliant on the river for existence (Osborne, 2000). The current rate of rapid economic growth in Southeast Asia and China is placing increased pressure on natural resources and the environment. The impact of competing national development objectives between the Mekong riparian states (and also within sovereign borders) has, and will continue to result in sporadic localised tension (Jacobs, 2002). Examples of localised conflict on the Lower Mekong Basin catalysed (or escalated) by competing water resource developments includes disputes over the Nam Theun 2 Hydropower Project, the proposed Thailand Water Grid Project and the Sesan, Sre Pok and Sekong (3 S) hydropower projects on the Vietnam - Cambodia tributaries of the Mekong River. This third example (which will be explored in greater detail in Chapter 5) demonstrates the reality of water-related transboundary conflict. As an internationally supported <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> <b>organisation,</b> the MRC will be an important stakeholder in regional water governance especially as the drivers for water-related conflict increase within the Mekong Basin. However, the current institutional capacity of the MRC to mitigate and resolve conflict between riparian countries is weak (Backer, 2007). In a period of increasing economic growth and regional integration among Mekong riparian nations the increasing threat of water-related transboundary conflict has the potential to impede economic growth and compromise geopolitical stability. This thesis analyses water governance mechanisms in the Mekong however it is impossible to decouple water governance from the water, energy and food security nexus. This nexus reflects the interdependencies between water, energy and food by which energy production can influence water demand and access for food production. At the same time, water use can affect food security as well as energy requirements. The choices people make about what food they consume (which are closely linked with demographic and lifestyle changes and economic growth), influence both water and energy demands. For transboundary water governance to be effective it must acknowledge the links between water, energy and food security and the impacts on or relations to environment, climate, people's livelihoods and the economy...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{training}} material is to improve efficiency and effectiveness {{in the application of}} integrated water resources management (IWRM) for sustainable management and development of water resources. The training is particularly targeted at the staff of <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> <b>organisations</b> (RBOs). Sustainable management of water resources is an important goal being adopted at national and international level in a bid to address water shortages, inequity, pollution and many other water problems. One of the key changes being adopted follows from the recognition that upstream / downstream effects require management using a basin approach. As a result many countries are introducing new institutional arrangements for water resources management, including organizations to manage water resources at the basin level – (RBOs). Creating new structures, or changing old ones, to meet the goals of integrated water resources management is not easy and there is evidence that the introduction of new <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> <b>organisations</b> does not run smoothly in many countries.

40|$|The {{construction}} of hydropower plants on transboundary rivers is seldom done with equal benefits to all riparians, and therefore presents {{coordination and cooperation}} challenges. Without a supra-national authority in charge of transboundary <b>river</b> <b>basins,</b> coordination between sectors (water, energy and environment) and cooperation between countries largely depends on willingness of the individual nation states and the power relations between these countries.

40|$|Conflict {{over water}} {{has grown in}} the mountainous areas of Thailand since the {{replacement}} of opium with alternative crops. PVC-sprinkler irrigation has enabled dry-season expansion of these cash crops on sloping lands, intensifying demand for water when it is most scarce. The technology and institutions that form the backbone of these irrigation systems have evolved simultaneously {{in a process of}} adaptive governance, in which local farmers draw on local social resources to balance competition and cooperation. Common conceptions of upstream – downstream conflict, pitting Thai against ethnic minorities in a struggle for resources, dominate the discourse of watersheds in Thailand. Upland water users themselves are diverse and their resource management systems are dynamic, even if they are not recognised as legitimate users of water. Understanding how upland communities create local systems of resource governance through dry-season irrigation is highly relevant for governance at higher levels, such as in the efforts to establish watershed networks and <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> <b>organisations...</b>|$|R
40|$|Those {{responsible}} for water governance face great complexity. However, the conceptualisations of what comprises that complexity have been broad and inconsistent. When efforts {{are made to}} address the complexity in water governance, {{it is unclear whether}} the problems and the related solutions will be understood across the actors and institutions involved. This paper provides {{a review of the literature}} focused on global water governance to discern core themes that commonly characterise discussions of complexity. It then considers how the consequences of these issues are manifested at the local scale through an examination of empirical research of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and the Prachinburi <b>River</b> <b>Basin</b> Committee. The results demonstrate that a history of a technical, depoliticised discourse is often perceived to contribute to complexity. The consequence is that when a severe ecological disturbance occurs within a <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> with poorly understood causes, few tools are available to support <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> <b>organisations</b> to address the political nature of these challenges. Additionally, a lack of clear authority structures has been recognised globally, but locally this can contribute to conflict amongst the 'governors' of water. Finally, a range of contested definitions and governance frameworks exists that contributes to complexity, but confronting the diversity of perspectives can lead to ethical dilemmas given that the decisions will affect the health and livelihoods of basin communities...|$|R
40|$|Transboundary water {{governance}} {{has received}} special {{attention in the}} wake of the World Bank vice-president Ismail Serageldin’s famous prediction in 1995 that, “if the wars of this century were fought over oil, the wars of the next century will be fought over water”. The water wars scenario ensures that in the world’s more than 260 <b>river</b> <b>basins</b> that flow across national boundaries, primary attention is given to managing water as an international commons. A framework for such transboundary management has been in place more or less continuously in the Mekong for half a century, and it would appear that water has indeed been a force for cooperation even when brutal conflict has torn at the region. Despite the appearance of successful basin-scale management, inter-governmental management of water as an international commons in a transboundary <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> context can also hide some troubling ways in which water as a commons is eroded in the process of development. This paper considers common property dimensions of water and the livelihood systems that they support at multiple scales within the Mekong. It goes on to look at ways in which these are impacted upon by bureaucratisation, infrastructure and commodification processes. Ironically, <b>basin</b> <b>organisations</b> can both enhance and undermine governance for the common good, depending on how they deal with commonality of interest in freshwater at various scales. The paper draws on brief case studies of current trends in water governance including <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> <b>organisations</b> in the Mekong (the Mekong River Commission and <b>River</b> <b>Basin</b> Committees at national levels), of infrastructure (Thailand’s proposed Water Grid and Laos’ Nam Theun 2 dam) and of commodified notions of water (as a development resource and as a scarce commodity to be managed through market mechanisms) ...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} decades, {{research}} on the governance of internationally shared <b>river</b> and lake <b>basins</b> provides ample evidence that cooperation can prevail over conflict (Wolf 2007; DeStefano et al. 2010). Scholars have also been able to provide comprehensive explanations for why and under which conditions agreements on shared watercourses are signed and <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> <b>organisations</b> (RBOs) emerge (Song and Whittington 2004; Dinar 2007). The mere existence of RBOs does not, however, necessarily ensure that water-related problems in a shared basin will be solved, nor that {{the resources of the}} basin will be managed in a sustainable way. Instead, reality shows that some RBOs have been able to effectively govern their basin while others have failed, or have made limited contributions to the solution of water-related challenges. In some <b>river</b> <b>basins</b> governed by RBOs, key problems of collective action have been addressed successfully. In the Danube and the Rhine <b>river</b> <b>basins,</b> for instance, the activities of the respective RBOs have significantly contributed to improving the water quality of the <b>rivers.</b> In other <b>basins,</b> however, challenges remain in spite of the existence of the RBO — such as in the Mekong <b>River</b> <b>Basin,</b> where the Mekong River Commission (MRC) is struggling to address conflicts over the use of the river and, in particular, the consequences of unilateral water use projects.

It illustrates {{a broad range of}} relevant activities for <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> management reflecting the comprehensive nature of the goals and activities of the organisation.

40|$|Semi-arid {{conditions}} that {{prevail in the}} Limpopo basin in general and Zimbabwe in particular emphasise the importance of water storage. In this respect small reservoirs {{play a critical role}} in sustaining rural livelihoods. However, the management of small reservoirs in Zimbabwe is negatively affected by missing or poorly coordinated information relating to such key attributes as location, capacity, and environmental condition. A study was undertaken to identify and characterise small reservoirs in the Limpopo <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> in Zimbabwe. The objective of the study was to identify small reservoirs and characterise them in terms of capacity, and chlorophyll-a and turbidity indices, as proxies for measuring environmental degradation of catchments in which these are located. The study was carried out in Gwanda district that is located in South West Zimbabwe. Identification was done by processing Landsat TM 4 - 5 images of February-March and April-May 2009, using Geographical Information Systems. Time and cost considerations were the main factors in the selection of the technology and the images that were used. Field inspections were used to validate selected parameters from February to April 2011. A total of 256 small reservoirs, with an estimated total capacity of 17 million m 3, were identified. The capacities of reservoirs were found to vary widely from around 4, 000 m 3 to over 650, 000 m 3. About half (46 %) of the small reservoirs were found to be dry by May, just two months after the end of the wet season. Seven reservoirs, which represented 2 % of the total number and 3 % of the total capacity of reservoirs, were characterised as highly turbid. Twenty-three reservoirs, representing 9 % of the total number and 3 % of the total capacity of reservoirs, showed signs of environmental degradation in the catchments. The smallest reservoirs were found to be most vulnerable to environmental degradation. The study concluded that Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) can successfully be used to identify and characterise small reservoirs in the data-poor Limpopo basin in Zimbabwe, and can be used by decentralised water institutions and <b>River</b> <b>Basin</b> <b>Organisations</b> (RBOs) to better manage available water resources for the benefit of rural communities found therein. </p...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the process of}} water sector reform in Botswana, focusing on barriers to effective delivery of clean water and improved sanitation services (WSS) to all, and water resource management (WRM), in a water insecure country, dependent for surface water on international <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> <b>organisations.</b> The study provides a crtitical analysis of policy change in progress. The impact of the water reforms on {{the poor and the}} process of centralising control of WSS, from both tribal and local authorities and the problems encountered are addressed. This study first reviews Botswana’s historical and recent performance on WRM and WSS and {{examines the}} underlying drivers and early outcomes of the recent major reform process. Advocacy Coalition Theory (Weible et al 2009, 2008; Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith 1999, 1993) provides the theoretical basis to give insights into the processes of policy reform. The research uses documents and observations of government policy planning and implementation processes from 2010 to 2013. Insights are also drawn from key informant interviews and focus groups from village to national level. The results show the relevance of Advocacy Coalition Theory to Botswana’s history of water sector reform; a struggle between a pre- 2009 hydro-mission coalition comprised of an elite, grown successful on mining revenues and the culture of cattle; to a post- 2009 coalition formed broadly around concern about water availability and an ecological culture that harks back to the past. Changes include new tariff reform policies, which could be seen as running counter to Water Demand Management (WDM), as they are mitigated within the Government’s policies of poverty eradication. The centralisation of WSS provision under a Parastatal, the Water Utilities Corporation, has been completed. A new Water Policy and Regulator, set to be established, appears to reflect the gradual success of the more environmentally focused coalition, seeking stronger water secure independent IWRM and WDM policies. This process is still in play and it will require strong political will to complete Botswana’s transition to a sustainable water-based political economy. Lessons about surmounting the barriers to effective IWRM and National WRM and delivery of WSS elsewhere in developing countries could be learned from the policy processes in this geographically large, water constrained African country...|$|R
