40|$|<b>Rhizomania</b> is a soil-borne {{disease that}} occurs {{throughout}} the major sugar beet growing {{regions of the}} world, causing severe yield losses {{in the absence of}} effective control measures. It is caused by Beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV), which is transmitted by the obligate root-infecting parasite Polymyxa betae. BNYVV has a multipartite RNA genome with all natural isolates containing four RNA species, although some isolates have a fifth RNA. The larger RNA 1 and RNA 2 contain the housekeeping genes of the virus and are always required for infection, whereas the smaller RNAs are involved in pathogenicity and vector transmission. RNA 5 -containing isolates are restricted to Asia and some parts of Europe, and these isolates tend to be more aggressive. With no acceptable pesticides available to restrict the vector, the control of <b>rhizomania</b> is now achieved almost exclusively through the use of resistant cultivars. A single dominant resistance gene, Rz 1, has been used to manage the disease worldwide in recent years, although this gene confers only partial resistance. More recently, new variants of BNYVV have evolved (both with and without RNA 5) that are able to cause significant yield penalties on resistant cultivars. These isolates are not yet widespread, but their appearance has resulted in accelerated searches for new sources of resistance to both the virus and the vector.

40|$|<b>Rhizomania</b> {{disease of}} sugar beet, caused by Beet {{necrotic}} yellow vein virus (BNYVV), {{is responsible for}} severe economic losses. Due to the widespread occurrence of BNYVV {{and the absence of}} other practical and efficient control measures, economic viability of the crop is to the largest extent dependent on the use of varieties genetically resistant to the disease. Recent reports on the emergence of virus strains capable of compromising the Rz 1 -based resistance {{as well as on the}} spread of highly pathogenic RNA 5 -containing BNYVV isolates have necessitated a detailed investigation of the situation as it evolves in Greece. The study revealed the widespread occurrence of BNYVV throughout the country as well as the prevalence of pathotype A isolates in all sugar beet growing regions. Sequence determination of the p 25 protein, responsible for symptom development, pointed to the amino acid motifs ACHG/VCHG in the hypervariable amino acid region 67 - 70. However, the presence of valine (V) in position 67 was not associated with increased pathogenicity and resistance breaking properties. Disease severity appeared mostly dependent on agroclimatic conditions influencing the progress of the disease. A survey for a possible occurrence of Beet Soilborne Virus (BSBV) and Beet Virus Q (BVQ) in <b>rhizomania</b> infested fields revealed the co-existence of both viruses, with BVQ being systematically found in co-infections with BNYVV, while BSBV was in all cases only found in triple infections.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Rhizomania</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} diseases affecting sugar beet. It leads to a severe loss in terms of root yield and sugar content up to 90 % and up to 70 % respectively, depending on the disease severity. It was reported in some regions of Marmara, Central Black Sea, and Central Anatolia and tends to spread in other regions in Turkey. The disease is caused by Beet Necrotic Yellow Vein Benyvirus (BNYVV) and transmitted by a fungus, Polymyxa betae. The primary source of its spread is through the movement of infested soils or beets. Only cultural control methods are employed to control this disease. At present, the most effective control measure is to use of partially resistant sugar beet cultivars. The other additional measures like planting early into cool soils, minimizing watering, avoiding soil compaction, and employing crop rotations can reduce levels of the virus in the soil. Therefore, it is essential to determine the infested areas and take cultural measures before the disease causes economically important yield losses. Based on a three-year crop rotation, surveys were conducted and sugar beet root samples were collected from the growing areas in 102 regions of 17 sugar factory boundaries and in three periods including 1996 - 1998, 1999 - 2001 and 2002 - 2004. These root samples were tested by means of DAS-ELISA and distribution of BNYVV was determined. <b>Rhizomania</b> was detected in the sugar beet production areas of 4, 9 and 15 sugar factories in 1996 - 1998 1999 - 2001, and 2002 - 2004 at the rates of 19. 30 % (46200 ha), 31. 42 % (94140 ha), and 48. 66 % (203640 ha), respectively.

40|$|Since the {{widespread}} use of <b>rhizomania</b> partially resistant cultivars, bearing the Rz 1 gene along with high yield capacities, multiple Rz 1 resistance-breaking events have been reported both in the USA and in Europe. A single mutation from alanine to valine in the p 25 hypervariable amino acid tetrad was linked with such resistance breaking (Koenig et al., 2009). Although there are difficulties for determining the effect of virus variation along with the role of other soil-borne pathogens, inoculum densities as well as questions regarding a possible genetic erosion of the resistance enhancer genes, understanding the dynamic of the emergence of resistance breaking isolates as well as evaluating their fitness and ability to spread is of the uttermost importance. Between the 2007 and 2010 sugar beet growing season, <b>rhizomania</b> affected fields have been surveyed in France, in the Pithiviers region. More than 600 samples were collected both in disease and non-disease expressing areas. Samples were tested for the presence of BNYVV by RT-PCR targeting mostly the p 14, p 25 and p 26 genes. The multiplex RT-PCR (Meunier et al., 2003) was also used to detect the rhizomania-associated pomoviruses Beet soil-borne virus and Beet virus Q, together with their vector Polymyxa betae. The presence of the Beet black scorch virus was also checked in selected samples. In the frame of a long-term study of <b>rhizomania,</b> field trials were set up in 2009 and 2010 to follow up the evolution of the disease within a single sugar beet growing seasons. The results confirmed the large presence of BNYVV type B and P in the surveyed areas, with mixed infections in single beets.

Control of <b>rhizomania</b> depends on the accurate and sensitive detection of BNYVV in plants and soil, for a precocious of infected fields and for breeding resistant sugar beet lines. Also the complexity introduced by the co-occurrence with other soil-inhabiting viruses raises needs for efficient detection techniques. Therefore, molecular diagnostic methods have been thoroughly used and developed for the identification and quantification of the Beet necrotic yellow vein virus as well as the other soil-borne sugar beet viruses and their vector. A description of sugar beet soil-borne viruses and their vector Polymyxa betae is therefore proposed in this chapter, focusing on the molecular diagnostic methods proposed for their detection and quantification, from serological to the polymerase-based methods...|$|E
40|$|Beet {{necrotic}} yellow vein virus (BNYVV, Benyvirus) is {{the causal}} agent of <b>rhizomania</b> disease. BNYVV and Beet soil-borne mosaic virus (BSBMV, Benyvirus) share high similarity in their genome organisation. These viruses {{as well as}} Beet virus Q (BVQ, Pomovirus) and Beet soil-borne virus (BSBV, Pomovirus) are vectored by the plasmodiophorid Polymyxa betae. BNYVV P 25 protein {{has been reported to}} be associated with the development of <b>rhizomania</b> disease, thus being a virulence factor of the virus. Recently, resistance breaking isolates of BNYVV have been reported in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Additionally, BSBMV has been observed in USA in the fields where BNYVV is not present. In order to understand the dynamics of the viruses associated with <b>rhizomania</b> in the crop, sugar beet plants were baited with soils containing P. betae from USA, the Netherlands, Germany, France and Sweden. BNYVV, BSBMV, BVQ and BSBV were detected by RT-PCR from total RNA isolated from root tissue of the plants. P. betae was detected in samples from all the soils, as well as BSBV. BNYVV was detected in all the samples except for root samples growing in soils from USA, which only showed presence of BSBMV. BVQ was only detected in samples from German, Dutch and Swedish soils. Amino acid sequences of the 'tetrads' of the BNYVV P 25 protein from isolates from Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, and France were found to have the following amino acid sequences: AYHR, AYHR, AYPR and SYHG, respectively. These differences in the tetrad sequence of P 25 might be associated with the resistance breaking events by the BNYVV isolates from the Dutch soil, which need further study. Amplifications of full-length RNA 2 of BSBMV revealed the presence of additional RNA species. These species appeared to represent chimeric RNAs characterized by the presence of complete RNA 2 ORF for the coat protein in the 5 ’-terminus fused to the 3 '-untranslated region of either RNA 3 or RNA 4. The presence and accumulation of chimeric RNAs were confirmed by qRT-PCR. Notably, the levels of chimeric RNAs were up to 20 -fold higher as compared to accumulation of BSBMV RNA 2. The influence of the chimeric RNAs on the expression of viral symptoms and accumulation of BSBMV remains to be studied...|$|E
40|$|<b>Rhizomania,</b> {{caused by}} Beet {{necrotic}} yellow vein virus (BNYVV), {{is widely considered}} {{to be one of}} the major threats to European sugar beet productivity. Currently, partially resistant varieties are available for controlling the disease. More recently, questions have been raised since the detection of aggressive BNYVV sources or types at several locations in Europe and America. Furthermore, the complexity of the disease has been emphasized by the role of the virus vector, the plasmodiophorid Polymyxa betae, and the role of three other soil-borne viruses also found in association with sugar beet, Beet soil-borne mosaic virus, a Benyvirus similar to the BNYVV and the two pomoviruses Beet soil-borne virus and Beet virus Q. To address the increasingly complex challenge of this multi-faceted disease, a multi-disciplinary team of researchers has gathered within the IIRB pest and disease group. This team is comprised of members from academic research, national sugar beet research institutes and sugar beet breeding companies, from different disciplines including virology, mycology and plant breeding. The aim of this network is to add value to research currently pursued locally; the group acts as a think tank where ideas are highlighted and discussed openly. The current strategies or technical approaches being used to investigate the problem include the use of full-length infectious viral clones, the study of the proteins possibly involved in the virus-plant interaction through 2 -D gel electrophoresis and the yeast two-hybrid system, the analysis of the virus variability through specific sequencing of the viral genome, the study of virus-virus and virus-vector interactions, as well as the development of research tools for the quantification and the detection of Polymyxa. The research on <b>rhizomania</b> has therefore been triggered by the exchange of working material (e. g. reference soils, sugar beet varieties), research results, and by joint research and publications on BNYVV as well as by the exchange of researchers and joint meetings. Published results on <b>rhizomania</b> from the different group members will be used to summarize current knowledge and challenges posed by the disease, thus highlighting the benefits of a cooperative approach for studying this complex disease...|$|E
40|$|<b>Rhizomania</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} Sugar beet diseases throughout the world. The disease is caused by beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV). The Polymyxa betae (Keskin) is the only natural transmitting agent of the disease between the plants. The fungus is an obligate parasite and could not be cultured in the media, then detection of fungus is done normally by microscopic observation. In order to facilitate detection process, present study is done to develop specific antibodies against this fungus by applying recombinant protein. The Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) as a specific immunogenic protein is a critical enzyme expressed i...|$|E
40|$|<b>Rhizomania,</b> {{caused by}} the beet {{necrotic}} yellow vein virus (BNYVV), is a world-wide problem for sugar beet production. Although <b>rhizomania</b> was first detected in sugar beet in the northern Italian Po Valley, wild beet on the Adriatic coast near the Po estuary show no virus infection under natural conditions. Our aim was to exa-mine whether this absence of virus infection is caused by endogenous wild beet resistance or by the saline soil conditions of coastal habitats. Greenhouse experiments were carried out with pot plants grown from coastal seed and with a BNYVV-susceptible sugar beet variety as control. The plants were grown in highly BNYVV in-fested soil. To simulate saline conditions, the pots were periodically irrigated with sea salt solutions of two dif-ferent concentrations or with tap water as a control. The BNYVV levels in the plant were measured by ELI-SA. Without salt, a range of tolerances to BNYVV was observed in plants derived from different coastal popu-lations. One population was highly virus resistant, two were more heterogeneous and three populations were highly susceptible. In the presence of salt the data showed a significant reduction {{of the number of}} infec-ted plants. These results indicate that the absence of vi-rus in wild beet populations is mainly due to the saline soil conditions in coastal habitats. This phenomenon will be important for the biosafety assessment of gene flow of BNYVV resistance genes from transgenic sugar beet to wild beet populations in coastal habitats...|$|E
40|$|Three soilborne viruses {{transmitted}} by Polymyxa betae KESKIN in sugar beet have been described: Beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV), {{the agent of}} <b>rhizomania,</b> Beet soilborne virus (BSBV), and Beet virus Q (BVQ). A multiplex reverse transcription-PCR technique was developed to simultaneously detect BNYVV, BSBV, and BVQ, together with their vector, P. betae. The detection threshold of the test was up to 128 times {{greater than that of}} an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Systematic association of BNYVV with one or two different pomoviruses was observed. BVQ was detected in samples from Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Sweden, and The Netherlands but not in samples from Turkey...|$|E
40|$|We use a {{spatially}} explicit, {{stochastic model}} to analyse {{the effectiveness of}} different scales of local control strategies in containing the long-term, multi-seasonal spread of a crop disease through a dynamically changing population of susceptible crops {{in which there is}} cryptic infection. The model distinguishes between susceptible, infested and symptomatic fields. It is motivated by <b>rhizomania</b> disease on sugar beet in the UK as an exemplar of a spatially structured and partially asymptomatic epidemic. Our results show the importance of matching the scales of local control strategies to prevent intensification and regional spread of disease with the inherent temporal and spatial scales of an epidemic. A simple field-scale containment strategy, whereby the susceptible crop is no longer grown on fields showing symptoms, fails for this system with cryptic infection because the locally applied control lags behind the epidemic. A farm-scale strategy, whereby growers respond to the disease status of neighbouring farms by transferring their quota for sugar beet to farmers in regions of reduced risk, succeeds. We conclude that a soil-borne pathogen such as <b>rhizomania</b> could be managed by movement of susceptible crops in the landscape using a strategy that matches the temporal and spatial scales of the epidemic and which take account of risk aversion among growers. We show some parallels and differences in effectiveness between a ‘culling’ strategy involving crop removal around emerging foci and the local deployment of partially resistant varieties that reduce amplification and transmission of inoculum. Some relationships between the control of plant and livestock diseases are briefly discussed...|$|E
