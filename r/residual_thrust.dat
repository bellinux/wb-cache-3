40|$|The {{high-pressure}} oxidizer turbopump (HPOTP) {{consists of}} two centrifugal pumps, on a common shaft, that are directly driven by a hot-gas turbine. Pump shaft axial thrust is balanced in that the double-entry main inducer/impeller is inherently balanced and the thrusts of the preburner pump and turbine are nearly equal but opposite. <b>Residual</b> shaft <b>thrust</b> is controlled by a self-compensating, non-rubbing, balance piston. Shaft hang-up must be avoided if the balance piston is to perform properly. One potential cause of shaft hang-up is contact between the Phase 2 bearing support and axial spring cartridge of the HPOTP main pump housing. The status of the bearing support/axial spring cartridge interface is investigated under current loading conditions. An ANSYS version 4. 3, three-dimensional, finite element model was generated on Lockheed's VAX 11 / 785 computer. A nonlinear thermal analysis was then executed on the Marshall Space Flight Center Engineering Analysis Data System (EADS). These thermal results were then applied along with the interference fit and bolt preloads to the model as load conditions for a static analysis to determine the gap status of the bearing support/axial spring cartridge interface. For possible further analysis of the local regions of HPOTP main pump housing assembly, detailed ANSYS submodels were generated using I-DEAS Geomod and Supertab (Appendix A) ...|$|R
40|$|LectureThe <b>residual</b> axial <b>thrust</b> {{acting on}} the rotor of a {{centrifugal}} compressor {{is the result of}} the non-uniform pressure distribution on the surfaces in contact with the process gas, plus the differential pressure {{acting on the}} faces of the balance piston(s) and the contribution due to the momentum variation of the process gas. During the design phase the axial load shall be verified to remain safely lower than the thrust bearing capacity, under all possible operating conditions; this requires a high degree of accuracy in the calculation model used to evaluate each thrust component. Errors in this calculation may lead to high bearing pad temperature during operation, to early wearing of the pad surfaces and ultimately to the damage or failure of the thrust bearing (Moll and Postill, 2011), thus jeopardizing the integrity of the whole compressor. The main difficulty of axial thrust calculation lies in the correct prediction of the static pressure distribution over the external surface of the impeller hub and shroud. This distribution depends on a large set of parameters, including rotor geometry, operating conditions, properties of the process gas, leakages flows across the rotor-stator seals. A detailed fluid-dynamic model of the gas in the cavities between impeller and diaphragm was developed and applied first to stage model tests and then to high-pressure centrifugal compressors, and its predictability was assessed by direct comparison with experimental data. The compressors were tested in full load conditions, with thrust bearing pads equipped with load cells, and the thrust values were recorded for several points across the operating envelope...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTDesign of a Pump Jet Propulsor (PJP) was {{undertaken}} for an underwater body with axisymmetric configuration using {{axial flow compressor}} design techniques supported by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis for performance prediction. Experimental evaluation of the PJP was carried out through experiments in a Wind Tunnel Facility (WTF) using momentum defect principle for propulsive performance prior to proceeding with extensive experimental evaluation in towing tank and cavitation tunnel. Experiments were particularly conducted with respect to Self Propulsion Point (SPP), <b>residual</b> torque and <b>thrust</b> characteristics over a range of vehicle advance ratio in order to ascertain whether sufficient thrust is developed at the design condition with least possible imbalance torque left out due to residual swirl in the slip stream. Pumpjet and body models were developed for the propulsion tests using Aluminum alloy forged material. Tests were conducted from 0 m/s to 30 m/s at four rotational speeds of the PJP. SPP was determined confirming the thrust development capability of PJP. Estimation of residual torque was carried out at SPP corresponding to speeds of 15, 20 and 25 m/s to examine {{the effectiveness of the}} stator. Estimation of <b>thrust</b> and <b>residual</b> torque was also carried out at wind speeds 0 and 6 m/s for PJP RPMs corresponding to self propulsion tests to study the propulsion characteristics during the launch of the vehicle in water where advance ratios are close to Zero. These results are essential to assess the thrust performance at very low advance ratios to accelerate the body and to control the body during initial stages. This technique {{has turned out to be}} very useful and economical method for quick assessment of overall performance of the propulsor and generation of exhaustive fluid dynamic data to validate CFD techniques employed...|$|R

50|$|If {{the full}} power of reverse thrust is not desirable, thrust reverse can be {{operated}} with the throttle set {{at less than}} full power, even down to idle power, which reduces stress and wear on engine components.

50|$|The rocket {{followed}} the same trajectory as the previous flight, which failed to place the Trailblazer, NanoSail-D, PRESat and Celestis Explorers spacecraft into orbit. No major changes {{were made to the}} rocket, other than increasing the time between first stage burnout and second stage separation. This minor change addressed the failure seen on the previous flight, recontact {{between the first and second}} stages, by dissipating <b>residual</b> <b>thrust</b> in the first stage engine before separating them.|$|E
50|$|While {{the power}} turbine may be {{integral}} with {{the gas generator}} section, many turboprops today feature a free power turbine on a separate coaxial shaft. This enables the propeller to rotate freely, independent of compressor speed. <b>Residual</b> <b>thrust</b> on a turboshaft is avoided by further expansion in the turbine system and/or truncating and turning the exhaust 180 degrees, to produce two opposing jets. Apart from the above, {{there is very little}} difference between a turboprop and a turboshaft.|$|E

5000|$|Sometimes, only {{a single}} weight and cable is used. Such an {{arrangement}} is colloquially named a [...] "yo-weight." [...] When the final stage is a solid rocket, the stage may continue to thrust slightly even after spacecraft release. This is from residual fuel and insulation in the motor casing, outgassing even without significant combustion. In a few cases, the spent stage has rammed the payload. [...] By using one weight without a matching counterpart, the stage eventually tumbles. The tumbling motion prevents <b>residual</b> <b>thrust</b> from accumulating in a single direction; instead, the stage's exhaust averages out to a much lower value {{over a wide range}} of directions.|$|E
50|$|NanoSail-D was to {{have been}} {{deployed}} on the third flight of the Falcon 1 rocket, which was launched from Omelek Island at 03:34 UTC on 3 August 2008. One of two CubeSats aboard, along with PRESat, it was a secondary payload to the Trailblazer which {{was to have}} been operated by the Operationally Responsive Space Office of the United States Department of Defense. The launch was conducted by SpaceX, and also carried a space burial payload for Celestis. Two minutes and forty seconds after launch, the spent first stage of the rocket was jettisoned; however, unexpected <b>residual</b> <b>thrust</b> caused it to recontact the second stage, which resulted in the rocket being thrown off course.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to measure an active drag in {{competitive}} swimming. At first, the active drag of the front crawl is measured by using the original measurement device which is developed for this experiment. The active drag is estimated by means of the relationship between the <b>residual</b> <b>thrust</b> and passive drag. As a result, the experimental equation concerning with the relation between the active drag and Reynolds number was obtained. According to the comparison this study with previous study, good agreement was obtained between the previous results and theoretical prediction...|$|E
40|$|We {{aimed to}} develop a new method for {{evaluating}} the drag in front-crawl swimming at various velocities and at full stroke. In this study, we introduce the basic principle and apparatus for the new method, which estimates the drag in swimming using measured values of <b>residual</b> <b>thrust</b> (MRT). Furthermore, we applied the MRT to evaluate the active drag (Da) and compared it with the passive drag (Dp) measured for the same swimmers. Da was estimated in five-stages for velocities ranging from 1. 0 to 1. 4 m s− 1; Dp was measured at flow velocities ranging from 0. 9 to 1. 5 m s− 1 at intervals of 0. 1 m s− 1. The variability in the values of Da at MRT was also investigated for two swimmers. According to the results, Da (Da = 32. 3 v 3. 3, N = 30, R 2 = 0. 90) was larger than Dp (Dp = 23. 5 v 2. 0, N = 42, R 2 = 0. 89) and the variability in Da for the two swimmers was 6. 5 % and 3. 0 %. MRT can be used to evaluate Da at various velocities and is special in that it can be applied to various swimming styles. Therefore, the evaluation of drag in swimming using MRT is expected {{to play a role in}} establishing the fundamental data for swimming...|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 101 - 110 The {{design and}} {{application}} of solid couplings combined with flexible quill shafts for high speed turbocompressors are presented. Solid couplings are rigid in the axial direction. They transmit any <b>residual</b> <b>thrust</b> from one compressor casing to another, and even into the gear. A single thrust bearing then positions the complete rotor train. Elimination of individual thrust bearings results in a smaller lube-oil system and a reduced power loss. Any additional thrust components from a prestressed flexible-disc coupling or a gear-type coupling (gear lock) are completely avoided. The use of a flexible intermediate shaft (quill shaft) gives the solid coupling the same lateral flexibility as for a geartype or flexible-disc coupling. Criteria for allowable misalignment are given in this paper. A solid coupling is neither exposed {{to any kind of}} wear nor endangered by corrosion or stress corrosion so that no maintenance is necessary. Couplings have a decisive influence on rotordynamics. The conventional arrangement of a multicasing train with gear-type or flexible-disc couplings incorporates individual thrust bearings located outboard of the journal bearings (long shaft over hangs). Introducing solid couplings leads to a stiffer rotor by eliminating individual thrust bearings. A comparison of critical speeds of a high-speed/high-power compressor train is made alternatively equipped with solid couplings, flexible-disc or gear-type couplings. The response of the different rotors and couplings to specified unbalance weights is calculated and compared throughout the complete speed range. Torsional and lateral critical frequencies can easily be influenced by modification of intermediate shafts, even after installation of a compressor train. Operating experience on nearly 1500 compressors equipped with solid couplings have proven their excellent reliability especially on high speed, high power turbocompressor applications...|$|E
