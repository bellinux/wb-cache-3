50|$|The Association {{resulted}} from a pirate radio station, Radio Veronica, which broadcast from a ship on international waters {{off the coast of}} the Netherlands between 1959 and 1974.

5000|$|From 21 April 1960, {{the pirate}} radio station Radio Veronica [...] {{broadcast}} its programmes from an anchorage in the North Sea about four {{miles off the}} Scheveningen coast, originally calling itself Vrije <b>Radio</b> Omroep <b>Nederland</b> (VRON); Free <b>Radio</b> Station the Netherlands.

When the Netherlands ratified the Treaty of Strasbourg on 1 September 1974, Veronica applied for legal status and became the VOO, Caroline moved anchorage to the English coast, and RNI closed down completely. Memorable episodes during this period included the stranding of Radio Veronica's ship, the Norderney, which lost its anchor in a storm and ran aground on Scheveningen beach on 2 April 1973, and a firebomb attack on RNI's ship, the Mebo II, on 15 May 1971.|$|R

50|$|Media Network was {{the name}} of a weekly radio {{programme}} broadcast on Radio Netherlands Worldwide from 7 May 1981 until 26 October 2000. When the programme began the station was known as <b>Radio</b> <b>Nederland,</b> but was renamed Radio Netherlands shortly thereafter.

It was produced and presented by Jonathan Marks. In the course of 1994, he was joined by colleague Diana Janssen, who was working as a media researcher at the station, who co-hosted the show until shortly before its end.

50|$|Although never {{intended}} for publication, Micháns’ first serious literary endeavours {{date back to}} the 1970s, when he started writing short stories and poetry. It was not until after his first visits to India in the early 1990s that he decided to publish limited editions of his travel stories (The Eyes of Meenakshi), legends (The Merchant of Poompuhar) and a novel (Madurai, Madurai) based on Indian traditions and religion. The primary goal of these publications, however, was neither literary nor commercial, but to serve as fund-raisers for humanitarian projects in South India in which Micháns was then involved. He later continued to explore and write on other subjects, including autobiographical stories (Rogelio G.) and an essay on aspects of Argentina’s history up to 1982 (It Rains Red in Buenos Aires). Among his works in progress are a new series of Indian stories, animal stories and an introduction to aspects of Mongolian religious art. In addition, from 1995 to 2012 Micháns was a free-lance writer and editor for Podium Neerlandés, a classical music program of the Dutch international broadcasting station <b>Radio</b> <b>Nederland</b> for Spanish speaking, mainly Latin American audiences.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{controversial}} aspect of Mengelberg's biography centers on his actions and behaviour {{during the years}} of the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands between 1940 and 1945. His biographer Fritz Zwart writes (for <b>Radio</b> <b>Nederland)</b> of an [...] "interview Mengelberg had given with the Völkische Beobachter, the German Nazi newspaper...the gist of it was that, on hearing of the Dutch surrender to the German invaders on May 10, 1940, he had brought a toast with a glass of champagne and had also spoken about the close bond existing between the Netherlands and Germany." [...] Zwart also notes that Mengelberg conducted in Germany and in German-occupied countries throughout the war, and was photographed in the company of Nazis such as Arthur Seyss-Inquart. Explanations have ranged from political naiveté in general, to a general [...] "blind spot" [...] for criticism of anything German, given his own ancestry. After the war, in 1945, the Netherlands' Honour Council for Music banned him from conducting in the Netherlands for life; in 1947, after an appeal by his lawyers, the Council reduced his ban to six years, though also in 1947, Queen Wilhelmina withdrew his Gold Medal of Honor. This notwithstanding, he continued to draw a pension from the orchestra until 1949 when cut off by the city council of Amsterdam. Mengelberg retreated in exile to Zuort, Sent, Switzerland, where he remained until his death in 1951, just two months before the expiration of his exile order.|$|E
