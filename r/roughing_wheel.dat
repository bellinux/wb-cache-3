40|$|This note {{deals with}} an {{investigation}} into the establishment of manufacturing techniques, on a production scale, for surface grinding, high tensile heat resistant alloy sheet approximately 7 feet by 5 feet. Rigid manufacturing tolerances are demanded in which surface finish must not exceed 10 micro-inches and the thickness tolerance is plus or minus 0. 0002 inches. The information contained in this report applies to the surface grinding process in general and can be used to aid production planning, as a correct estimate of wheel life when operating under set conditions can be made, and the necessary time for redressing allowed. Results from the work carried out suggest that it may be beneficial to pass components to be surface ground under a <b>roughing</b> <b>wheel</b> (Lumsden) type machine, which will set the constant metal thickness for final finishing. In this way a correct estimated time could be allowed for the operations roughing and finish grinding at optimum conditions...|$|E

25|$|Polishing wheels {{come in a}} {{wide variety}} of types to fulfil a wide range of needs. The most common {{materials}} used for polishing wheels are wood, leather, canvas, cotton cloth, plastic, felt, paper, sheepskin, impregnated rubber, canvas composition, and wool; leather and canvas are the most common. Wooden wheels have emery or other abrasives glued onto them and are used to polish flat surfaces and maintained good edges. There are many types of cloth wheels. Cloth wheels that are cemented together are very hard and used for rough work, whereas other cloth wheels that are sewn and glued together are not as aggressive. There are cloth wheels that are not glued or cemented, instead these are sewed and have metal side plates for support. Solid felt wheels are popular for fine finishes. Hard <b>roughing</b> <b>wheels</b> can be made by cementing together strawboard paper disks. Softer paper wheels are made from felt paper. Most wheels are run at approximately 7500 surface feet per minute (SFM), however muslin, felt and leather wheels are usually run at 4000 SFM.|$|R

40|$|Impingement of {{grinding}} fluid {{deep into}} grinding zone {{is a challenge}} due to presence of air layer around the grinding wheel. This paper presents experimental observation on air boundary layer formed around a rotating grinding wheel, a rexine-cloth covered grinding wheel and a solid disc. The effect of porous and <b>rough</b> grinding <b>wheel</b> surface towards strengthening air boundary layer has been studied. Modeling {{has been done to}} estimate variation of air pressure within this boundary layer. Out of three different methods of extrapolation done, the most suitable one is suggested. Results obtained using three different wheels are compared. A scraper board is also employed to observe reduction of air pressure. Higher value of air pressure is noted in case of bare grinding wheel than that in other conditions. Use of scraper board along with rexine-covered wheel is found to reduce air pressure to a large extent such that it becomes close to air pressure noted around the solid wheel. It shows the beneficial effect of using scraper board and rexine-pasted wheel to suppress air layer effectively. Correspondingly, grinding fluid is expected to reach deep into the grinding zone thereby rendering better control of grinding temperature, and hence, better grinding performance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{studies the}} problem of {{traversing}} a <b>rough</b> terrain by <b>wheeled</b> vehicles. Here <b>rough</b> terrain implies terrain which is geometrically not ideal. The criterion for mobility of a wheeled vehicle in any terrain is formally developed, providing insights into the mechanical structure requirements of the vehicle. A vehicle structure with an actively articulated suspension is found {{as a solution to}} improved rough terrain mobility. The contact forces of the vehicle with the surface being traversed are identified as the critical factor in determining the traversability of the surface. Hence a control strategy involving the control of the contact forces (normal and traction) is proposed. The key feature of the locomotion strategy, thus developed, is that it provides a solution involving dynamics of the main body for improving mobility in rough terrain...|$|R

Background {{of the study is}} the problem of navigating heavy harvesters through skidder trails on their way to harvesting individual trees.

Therefore, harvester operators strive to navigate in a way that exactly the same (already compressed) path is used when they enter a skidder trail for a second time. For this task, vehicle navigation on a decimeter accuracy level is required. Data of existing techniques, such as GPS, IMU and/or odometry are error prone, because of difficulties like fluctuating signal strength of satellites caused by dense plant canopy, drift of IMU without update, and slippery, <b>rough</b> ground for <b>wheel</b> decoding.

40|$|Introduction: People’s {{attitudes to}} and {{perception}} of dogs vary both between and within societies {{and may be}} influenced by many factors (Serpell & Paul, 1994) including those unrelated such as environment (Wells & Hepper 1992). These include culture, knowledge, perception of breed and the appearance of the dog (Deshen & Deshen, 1989; Nakajima et al., 2002). The influence of a dog on the perception of its handler has been investigated (Mae et al., 2004) but it has not been established whether the characteristics of the handler can influence the perception of the dog. This is pertinent to the use of working dogs. Methodology: The research was by a questionnaire survey of students at Cork Institute of Technology. 463 respondents were asked to rate photographs of three breeds of dog alone and to then rate the same dogs with three of fifteen possible categories of handler, prior to completing the questionnaire. Results: There was a difference in mean rating for temperament for a dog alone and for the same dog with a handler, and there were between breed differences. Different dog breeds were rated significantly differently (Wilkes Lambda = 0. 187, F(13, 374) = 125. 053 P=. 000). There was a significant effect of handler on the perception of the Labrador (LR) (F(14, 462) = 8. 589 P=. 000), of the German shepherd (GSD) (14, 462) = 6. 513 P=. 000) and of the Airedale terrier (AT) (F(14, 461) = 7. 587 P=. 000) The handler categories, which appeared to influence perception most, were Police; <b>rough</b> male; <b>wheel</b> chair user’s; blind persons.

50|$|Almost all longboard {{wheels are}} made from urethane. The {{performance}} of longboard wheels is determined by five characteristics: height, lip shape, contact patch, durometer, and hub setting. Typical longboard wheels range from 65 to 107 mm in diameter. A taller wheel will have slower acceleration but a faster rolling speed. Smaller wheels have the opposite effect. The durometer of a wheel is how hard the urethane is. A softer wheel will be ultimately slower than a harder wheel on smooth surface. When the road surface gets <b>rougher</b> a softer <b>wheel</b> provides a smoother, faster ride. The fastest duro for the normal road is around 80a. Softer wheels have more grip than harder wheels on any surface. The contact patch of a wheel is {{the width of the}} section of the wheel that makes contact with the road. Generally, the wider the wheel, the more traction it will have. Wheels can be anywhere from 50 to 100 mm in width, but most commonly between 60 and(-) 70 mm. The shape of the lip has a noticeable effect on traction. Rounded lips are made to break loose into a slide and square lips are made to grip. Square lipped wheels do break loose but the slide is not as smooth as that of a round lipped wheel. A wheel hub (or core) is the plastic (or sometimes aluminum) center of a wheel that holds the bearings. The position of the hub affects the properties of the wheel.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Human {{attitudes to}} and {{perception}} of dogs vary both between and within societies and cultures and {{are influenced by}} many factors including factors unrelated to the dog such as it’s environment. These include cultural factors, personal knowledge, {{the function of the}} animal, the perceived intelligence and the appearance of the dog. It is known that the presence of a dog can influence perceptions of the handler but it has not been established whether the characteristics of the handler can influence the perception of the dog. This is especially pertinent to the area of working dogs. German shepherd dogs tend to have a negative image and may be under utilized in assistance dog work due to concerns regarding the public perception of this breed. Methodology: The research was by a questionnaire survey of students at Cork Institute of Technology. Respondents were asked to rate photographs of three breeds of dog alone and to then rate the same dogs with three of fifteen possible categories of “owner”, prior to completing the questionnaire. 463 questionnaires were completed. Results: There was a difference in mean rating for temperament for a dog alone and for the same dog with a handler, and there were between breed differences. Different dog breeds were rated significantly differently (Wilkes Lambda = 0. 187, F (13, 374) = 125. 053 P =. 000). There was a significant effect of handler on the perception of the Labrador (LR) (F (14, 462) = 8. 589 P =. 000), of the German shepherd (GSD) (14, 462) = 6. 513 P =. 000) and of the Airedale terrier (AT) (F (14, 461) = 7. 587 P =. 000) The handler categories, which appeared to influence perception most, were the Garda (Police) (male(m) and female(f)); <b>rough</b> male; <b>wheel</b> chair user (m and f); blind person (m and f). Pearson’s correlations revealed consistency in ratings throughout the questionnaire, with or without a visual representation for the LR and for the GSD but not for the AT. The LR has a positive image. The GSD while perceived as having a negative image, appears to have an altered image when seen in a working context, where people described it inferring intelligence and admirable character. The AT is uncommon in Ireland and without media association. This may explain the inconsistencies in ratings when presented either with or without a visual image. Conclusions: People’s perception of the temperament of a breed of dog may be influenced by the breed, by the appearance of the handler and by their experience and knowledge of dogs. The results appear consistent, that is, respondents perceived that the three breeds of dog were either more friendly or less friendly, when presented with certain differing categories of handler...|$|R
40|$|Unmanned ground {{vehicles}} {{continue to}} increase in importance for many industries, from planetary exploration to military defense. These vehicles require significantly fewer resources compared to manned vehicles while reducing risks to human life. Terramechanics can aid {{in the design and}} operation of small vehicles to help ensure they do not become immobilized due to limited traction or energy depletion. In this dissertation methods to improve terramechanics modeling for vehicle design and control of small unmanned ground vehicles (SUGVs) on granular soil are studied. Various techniques are developed to improve the computational speed and modeling capability for two terramechanics methods. In addition, a new terramechanics method is developed that incorporates both computational efficiency and modeling capability. 	First, two techniques for improving the computation performance of the semi-empirical Bekker terramechanics method are developed. The first technique stores Bekker calculations offline in lookup tables. The second technique approximates the stress distributions along the wheel-soil interface. These techniques drastically improve computation speed but do not address its empirical nature or assumption of steady-state operation. 	Next, the discrete element method (DEM) is modified and tuned to match soil test data, evaluated against the Bekker method, and used to determine the influence of rough terrain on SUGV performance. A velocity-dependent rolling resistance term is developed that reduced DEM simulation error for soil tests. DEM simulation shows that surface roughness can potentially {{have a significant impact on}} SUGV performance. DEM has many advantages compared to the Bekker method, including better locomotion prediction, however large computation costs limit its applicability for design and control. 	Finally, a surrogate DEM model (S-DEM) is developed to maintain the simulation accuracy and capabilities of DEM with reduced computation costs. This marks one of the first surrogate models developed for DEM, and the first known model developed for terramechanics. S-DEM stores wheel-soil interaction forces and soil velocities extracted from DEM simulations. S-DEM reproduces drawbar pull and driving torque for wheel locomotion on flat and <b>rough</b> terrain, though <b>wheel</b> sinkage error can be significant. Computational costs are reduced by three orders of magnitude, bringing the benefits of DEM modeling to vehicle design and control...|$|R
40|$|Robotic ground {{vehicles}} are mechanisms that use gravity and contact {{forces with the}} ground to perform motion. They can either be wheeled, tracked or legged. In this thesis we will focus on n-wheeled vehicles able to perform ground following motion with all the wheels maintaining contact at the same time. The main goal of this work is to establish the implication of the topological architecture of the vehicle mechanism on criteria such as climbing skills, robustness, ground clearance, weight, power consumption, and price. Efficient tools will be provided to help the robot designer to understand the implications of important design parameters like the number of wheels, the vehicle mechanism, and the motorisation of joints on the above criteria. The general state of a robotic ground vehicle can be described using spatial vectors containing both the linear and angular components of physical quantities such as position, velocity, acceleration and linear force. By definition, there is motion when the vehicle's link velocity state vector (expressed from the ground reference) is greater than zero. Wheeled ground following motion is then a special case of vehicle constrained motion where all wheels maintain contact with the ground. This thesis will describe a general kinematic and dynamic analysis of n-wheeled ground following robots. We will then discuss "contact forces optimisation techniques" and show {{the relationship between the}} number of wheels of a vehicle mechanism, the topological structure and the optimised degrees of fredom that we can get for the contact forces distribution. We will conclude with some considerations concerning the sensors needs for on-board terrain estimation. We will emphasise our argument using our two robot designs as examples: Shrimp: A 6 -wheeled ground vehicle based on a 3 DOF passive suspension mechanism. With this design, no sensor based control is necessary to maintain ground contact with all the wheels. The distribution of tangential contact forces is done passively but can be optimised with on board active control and sensors for contact properties estimation (gyro, joint position sensors). Octopus: A 8 -wheeled ground vehicle based on a (6 DOF active + 1 DOF passive) suspension mechanism. The autonomous coordination of the active 14 DOF is based on the on-board integration of inclinometer, joint position sensors and tactile wheels able to sense ground contact properties (angle, curvature, force, [...] .). With this design, active control can distribute the contact forces to minimise tangential forces and increase traction. This decreases the need for friction to climb obstacles. The theoretical investigation and new sensing concepts enable the design these two robots that demonstrate excellent capabilities for <b>rough</b> terrain. Passive <b>Wheeled</b> Locomotion Mechanisms (WLM) solutions are now mature enough for real applications like space exploration. However, active WLM solutions demonstrate potential climbing skills that cannot be equalled passively. Enhanced integration of sensors, actuators and advanced embedded control algorithms will lead to greater applications for future field and service robotics applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{complexity}} of today's autonomous robots poses {{a major challenge}} for Artificial Intelligence. These robots are equipped with sophisticated sensors and mechanical abilities {{that allow them to}} enter our homes and interact with humans. For example, today's robots are almost all equipped with vision and several of them can move over <b>rough</b> terrain with <b>wheels</b> or legs. The methods developed so far in Artificial Intelligence, however, are not yet ready to cope with the {{complexity of}} the information gathered through the robot sensors and the need for rapid action in partially unknown and dynamic environments. In this thesis, I will argue that the apparent complexity of the environment and of the robot brain can be significantly simplified if perception, behavior, and learning are allowed to co-develop on the same time scale. In doing so, robots become sensitive to, and actively exploit, characteristics of the environment that they can tackle within their own computational and physical constraints. This line of work is grounded on philosophical and psychological research showing that perception is an active process mediated by behavior. However, computational models of active vision are very rare and often rely on architectures that are preprogrammed to detect certain characteristics of the environment. Previous work have shown that complex visual tasks, such as position and size invariant shape recognition as well as navigation, can be tackled with remarkably simple neural architectures generated by a coevolutionary process of active vision and feature selection. Behavioral machines equipped with primitive vision systems and direct pathways between visual and motor neurons were evolved while freely interacting with their environments. I proceed further on this line of investigation and describe the application of this methodology in three situations, namely car driving with an omnidirectional camera, goal-oriented navigation of a humanoid robot, and cooperative tasks by two agents. I will show that these systems develop sensitivity to a number of oriented, retinotopic, visual features – oriented edges, corners, height – and a behavioral repertoire to locate, bring, and keep these features in sensitive regions of the vision system that allow them to accomplish their goals. In a second set of experiments, I will show that active vision can be exploited by the robot to perform anticipatory exploration of the environment in a task that requires landmark-based navigation. Evolved robots exploit an internal expectation system that makes use of active exploration to check for expected events in the environment. I will describe a third set of experiments where, in addition to an evolutionary process, the visual system of the robot can develop receptive fields by means of unsupervised Hebbian learning and show that these receptive fields are significantly affected by the behavior of the system and differ from those predicted by most computational models of visual cortex. Finally, I will show that these robots replicate the performance deficiencies observed in experiments of motor deprivation with kitten when they are exposed to the same type of motor deprivations. Furthermore, the analyses of our robot brains suggest an explanation for the deficiencies observed in kitten that have not yet been fully understood...|$|R
