40|$|AbstractElectronic animal {{identification}} {{is an important}} technology in modern animal husbandry providing great benefits. Low-frequency applications are state-of-the-art within the radio frequency identification of animals. Quasi-simultaneous detection of several animals and <b>reading</b> of <b>the</b> <b>transponders</b> over longer distances is impossible with low-frequency systems. Ultra-high-frequency (UHF) applications are suitable for this purpose. However, UHF systems have disadvantages through their susceptibility to metallic surfaces and liquids. Thus, the reflection and absorption of electromagnetic radiation in the animals' environment is often problematic. Consequently, an adjustment of <b>the</b> <b>transponder</b> ear tags regarding mechanical stability and functionality close to water (ear tissue) is necessary. In this project, targeted adjustments and a further development of UHF transponder ear tags concerning the resonance frequency were made. Three trials with cattle and two trials with pigs were performed in this study. Cattle were driven through a reader gate for ten rounds and six different types of transponder ear tags designed in-house were tested. The influence of the environment (indoor vs. outdoor), reader orientation at the gate (sideways vs. above) and output power of the readers (1. 0 vs. 0. 5 W) were tested in two experiments. The average number of readings per round and <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> rates of <b>the</b> <b>transponder</b> ear tag types were taken as target variables. In the trials with pigs, three transponder ear tag types were compared. The animals were driven through the gate for five rounds per repetition, but neither the reader output power nor the reader orientation were varied. The pig experiments were performed indoors. The results of the cattle experiments showed that {{the average number of}} readings per round and <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> rates were significantly higher indoors compared to outdoors. The reader output power of 1. 0 W achieved significantly better results compared to 0. 5 W. The same applied to the reader orientation ‘above’ compared to ‘sideways’. It could also be shown that an improvement of <b>the</b> <b>transponder</b> and, thus, an adjustment to the animal's ear could be achieved during transponder ear tag type development. A maximum reading rate of 100 % was reached with <b>the</b> cattle <b>transponder</b> types finally developed (B 3 - 4, B 4 - 4 and B 5). In addition, an average reading rate of 100 % was achieved for one pig transponder ear tag type (C 2). However, these experiments have to be treated with caution due to a very low sample size...|$|R
40|$|Radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) is an asymmetric radio protocol, where uplink communication (from transponder to reader) {{is implemented}} with backscattering modulation. The idea was first {{demonstrated in the}} 1940 's. One of the first consumer applications of RFID was access control, and key cards based on an inductive near field coupling are widely used even today. The introduction of Schottky diodes to CMOS processes enabled passive RFID, i. e. transponders without a battery, at ultra high frequencies (UHF) with reasonable cost and <b>read</b> range in <b>the</b> end of 1990 's. This has opened up new applications and inspired new research on RFID. This thesis studies the radio frequency (RF) components and general RF phenomena in RFID at UHF and millimetre waves. The theoretical analysis of the radio path reveals that <b>the</b> <b>read</b> range of a passive UHF system is ideally limited by the downlink, i. e. the power transfer from reader to <b>the</b> <b>transponder.</b> However, <b>the</b> architecture of the reader RF front end is critical, because the transmitted signal may couple {{a significant amount of}} noise to the receiver, overpowering the faint reflection from <b>the</b> <b>transponder.</b> In <b>the</b> thesis, two adaptive RF front ends are introduced to eliminate the noise coupling from the transmitter. One of the most critical problems with UHF RFID has been <b>the</b> detuning of <b>transponder</b> antennas on different mounting platforms. The detuning may significantly diminish <b>the</b> <b>read</b> range of <b>the</b> <b>transponder,</b> especially on metal surfaces. In this thesis, two backscattering-based measurement techniques for <b>the</b> <b>transponder</b> antennas are presented. The detuning effect has been studied using these measurement techniques, and a platform tolerant antenna is introduced. RFID at millimetre waves enables miniaturisation of the reader antenna, and widening the data bandwidth over short distances. This could be used to access wirelessly mass memories with wide data bandwidth. A semi-passive or active transponder could communicate, e. g., with automotive radars. The millimetre wave identification (MMID) has been theoretically studied and experimentally verified at 60 GHz...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to determine the}} efficiency of the electronic oestrus detection system Alpha-Detector (AD) in sheep. Males are equipped with a harness carrying the electronic device. This original system consists of a custom RFID reader which is triggered at the time of mounting to <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>transponder</b> that is placed on the females' rump. This detector stores the ID number of ewe together with date and time of each mount. Two trials were developed with Merinos d'Arles sheep. In Trial 1, visual observations (VO, i. e. continuous video records) were compared to readings made by 2 rams on 12 ewes. Ewes were allocated into two groups and were followed up for a period of two oestrous cycles i. e. hormonally induced oestrus (C 1) and natural oestrus (C 2). In Trial 2, 30 ewes tagged with a caudal transponder were naturally sired by a ram equipped with AD. In Trial 1, despite a widespread of the number of mounts per ewe (i. e. from 2 to 83), the AD allowed detection of 100 % of the females that came in oestrus (11 / 12 in C 1 and 8 / 12 in C 2). Hence, when considering only standing oestrus, the coincidence of true mounts reaches 94 % (342 readings/ 364 observed mounts). With regard to males' sexual activity, the first ram M 1 did 242 mounts, while only 110 mounts were recorded for the second male M 2. Overall Khi- 2 analysis confirmed highly significant (p M 2) and to a cycle effect (C 1 > C 2). This decline of sexual activity is assumed to be due to the onset of seasonal anoestrous. In Trial 2, oestrus occurrences, signaled by frequent mountings of the ram, were constantly distributed along time. All ewes displayed an oestrus during the first cycle (C 1 i. e. 17 days with the first ram). There is also a wide range in the number of mounts per ewes (from 3 to 205). Remarkably, 2 ewes that were mounted during first cycle came back in oestrus 17 days later as revealed by frequent mountings of the second ram in C 2. Lambing dates confirmed the time of conception observed with the AD. As observed in Trial 1, it is however necessary to discard isolated mounts that occurred just after male introduction and did not correspond to standing oestrus (no further readings within 6 hours). With the AD device 100 % of oestrus ewes were detected. Many researches on reproductive physiology and behavior that can be developed with this device are presented for small-ruminants at large...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an experimental study {{both in the}} laboratory and field to develop and test a method for continuously measuring and monitoring scour using an automated identification technology known as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). RFID systems consist of three main components, namely (a) the reader which controls the system, (b) <b>the</b> <b>transponder</b> (derived from transmitter/responder) that transmits data to the reader and (c) the excitation antenna that allows the communication between the reader and <b>the</b> <b>transponder.</b> <b>The</b> study provides an insight into the RFID technology and develops the framework for using this technology to eventually address two central themes in river mechanics and sediment transport; (a) {{the determination of the}} active layer thickness and (b) the scour/deposition depth around a hydraulic structure. In particular, this study develops the methodology for relating the signal strength of a radio frequency (RF) device with the distance between an excitation antenna and the RF device. The experiments presented herein are classified into two main groups, (1) the laboratory and (2) the RF signal vs. the detection distance experiments (field experiments). The laboratory experiments were designed to understand the effect of key RFID parameters (e. g., transponder orientation with respect to the excitation antenna plane, maximum antenna-transponder detection distance), measured in terms of <b>the</b> <b>transponder</b> return RF signal strength for various antenna-transponder distances, transponder orientations with respect to the excitation antenna plane and different mediums in between the excitation antenna and <b>the</b> <b>transponder,</b> on <b>the</b> overall performance of the RFID system. On the other hand, the RF signal vs. the detection distance experiments were based on the results obtained during the laboratory experiments and focused on developing calibration curves by relating <b>the</b> <b>transponder</b> return RF signal strength with the distance between the excitation antenna and a <b>transponder.</b> <b>The</b> laboratory results show that the dominant RFID parameters affecting the system performance are (a) <b>the</b> <b>transponder</b> orientation towards <b>the</b> excitation antenna plane and (b) the medium type in between the excitation antenna and <b>the</b> <b>transponder.</b> <b>The</b> differences in <b>reading</b> distances were attributed to <b>the</b> <b>transponder</b> inner antenna type, while the effect of the medium was related with the void ratio, where higher porosity materials have, less RF signal strength decay. The parameter that governs the RF signal strength decay was found to be the distance between the excitation antenna and <b>the</b> <b>transponder</b> (erosion process experiments). The RF signal strength decays almost linearly with distance, while the rate of the RF signal strength decay is controlled by the material type in between the excitation antenna and <b>the</b> <b>transponder</b> (deposition process experiments).

Because angle measurement is not necessary, the accuracy in large water depths is better than USBL.|$|R
50|$|How Highway 407 {{works is}} that every time the {{customer}} uses the route, the camera installed above the on-ramps take record of <b>the</b> <b>transponder,</b> leased by <b>the</b> Highway 407. <b>The</b> <b>transponder</b> holds information of the customer's automobile, and thus will mail the bill to <b>the</b> <b>transponder's</b> holder's residence. In case of the customer has no <b>transponder,</b> <b>the</b> camera takes {{a photo of the}} vehicle's licence plate, and a video toll charge will apply. If the customer fails to pay, an interest would be added to the owed amount. The fee would be charged when the customer attempts to renew their driver's licence.|$|R
