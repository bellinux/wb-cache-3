5|$|While maps {{drawn in}} ink on flat silk cloths {{have been found}} in the tomb of the Marquess of Dai (interred in 168 BCE at Mawangdui, Hunan province), the {{earliest}} known paper map found in China, dated 179–41 BCE and located at Fangmatan (near Tianshui, Gansu province), is incidentally the oldest known piece of paper. Yet Chinese hempen paper of the Western Han and early Eastern Han eras was of a coarse quality and used primarily as wrapping paper. The papermaking process was not formally introduced until the Eastern Han court eunuch Cai Lun (50–121 CE) created a process in 105 CE where mulberry tree bark, hemp, old linens, and fish nets were boiled together to make a pulp that was pounded, stirred in water, and then dunked with a wooden sieve containing a <b>reed</b> <b>mat</b> that was shaken, dried, and bleached into sheets of paper. The oldest known piece of paper with writing on it comes from the ruins of a Chinese watchtower at Tsakhortei, Alxa League, Inner Mongolia, dated precisely 110 CE when the Han garrison abandoned the area following a nomadic Xiongnu attack. By the 3rd century, paper became one of China's chief writing mediums.|$|E

2500|$|Zhu's fleet {{arrived at}} Poyang Lake on 29 August faced with Chen's larger force and was outnumbered three to two. According to one Ming source, Zhu's force arrived armed with [...] "fire bombs, fire guns, fire arrows, fire seeds , {{large and small}} fire lances, large and small 'commander' fire-tubes, large and small iron bombs, rockets." [...] This shows that older {{gunpowder}} weapons co-existed alongside guns, and proto-guns such as fire lances were not supplanted until after early Ming. A new weapon called the [...] "No Alternative" [...] was also mentioned. The No Alternative was [...] "made from a circular <b>reed</b> <b>mat</b> about five inches around and seven feet long that was pasted over with red paper and bound together with silk and hemp— stuffed inside it was gunpowder twisted in with bullets {{and all kinds of}} [...] gunpowder weapons." [...] It was hung from a pole on the foremast, and when an enemy ship came into close range, the fuse was lit, and the weapon would supposedly fall onto the enemy ship, at which point things inside shot out [...] "and burned everything to bits, with no hope of salvation." [...] Zhu's fleet engaged Chen's under orders to [...] "get close to the enemy's ships and first set off gunpowder weapons (發火器), then bows and crossbows, and finally attack their ships with short range weapons." [...] Fire bombs were hurled using naval trebuchets and the Ming succeeded in [...] "burning twenty or more enemy vessels and killing or drowning many enemy troops." [...] Ming eventually came out victorious by ramming and burning the enemy fleet with fire ships. While guns were used during the battle, ultimately they were not pivotal to success, and the battle was won using incendiary weapons.|$|E

50|$|In the United Kingdom and its colonies, lath {{and plaster}} was {{often used for}} {{interior}} partition walls {{and the construction of}} ceilings, before the introduction of plasterboard in the 1930s.
