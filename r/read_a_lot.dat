25|$|Café Josty {{was one of}} two rival cafés (the other {{being the}} Astoria, later Café Eins A), occupying the broad corner between Potsdamer Straße and Bellevuestraße. The Josty company had been founded in 1793 by two Swiss brothers, Johann and Daniel Josty, who had emigrated to Berlin from Sils in Switzerland and set up a bakery from which the café was a 1796 offshoot. It had {{occupied}} various locations including (from 1812 till 1880), a site in front of the Berlin City Palace, before moving to Potsdamer Platz in the latter year. A major player on the Berlin café scene, Josty attracted writers, artists, politicians and international society: {{it was one of the}} places to be seen. The writer Theodor Fontane, painter Adolf von Menzel, and Dadaist Kurt Schwitters were all guests; Karl Liebknecht, the Spartacus Communist movement leader <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> here and even made some key political speeches from the pavement terrace, while author Erich Kästner wrote part of his 1929 bestseller for children, Emil und die Detektive (Emil and the Detectives), on the same terrace and made the café the setting for an important scene in the book.|$|E

500|$|During an {{interview}} with Marion McMullen from the Coventry Evening Telegraph, Davies explained that the Gothic elements to the novel gave him inspiration to add dream sequences and fantasies to the script. He told McMullen, [...] "I've been very faithful to the book, {{but one of the}} differences has been writing the scenes showing Catherine's fantasies. Catherine is a great reader of horror fiction – the gothic novel was fairly popular in those days, like a young girl today who would <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of rather steamy romances. In this production, we see some of Catherine's fantasies, some of which are quite steamy for a young girl." [...] Davies admitted that he was proud of his reputation for [...] "sexing up" [...] the novels he had adapted and commented that none of his scenes were gratuitous. He told McMullen that he often looked for excuses to get the characters out of their clothes, as he felt they were always being [...] "buttoned up to the neck". Producer Keith Thompson said Davies had made Northanger Abbey a bit more erotic than the novel and thought the script had [...] "a wonderful cheekiness to it." [...] Davies chose to use a narrator to speak Austen's words and help set the scene {{at the beginning and end}} of the film.|$|E

He was born in Paris, and {{he was raised in}} bourgeois, [...] Republican and secular environment. His father Lucien was a lawyer, of “Dreyfusard” temperament, who quickly entered the Resistance in order to avoid exile. In June 1940, the family moved to Marseille. Arrested by the Gestapo on 15 May 1944, Vidal-Naquet’s father was deported, along with his wife, in June 1944. They were sent to Auschwitz, where they died. At 14 years old, Pierre Vidal-Naquet then hid in his grandmother’s house in the Drôme.

Wright's religious faith had contradictory influences on his life. On the one hand, he argued that his faith drove him to defend the [...] "Protestant people of Ulster", {{while at the same}} time, he conceded that the cold-blooded murder of non-combatant civilians would ensure his damnation. He spoke of this dilemma during an interview with Martin Dillon: [...] "You can't glorify God and seek to glorify Ulster because the challenges which are needed are paramilitary. That's a contradiction to the life God would want you to lead. If you were to get yourself involved in paramilitary activity in its present form, or the form in which it manifested itself during the Troubles, then I don't think you could walk with God...|$|E
2500|$|Hal was memorialized with {{a chapter}} in the memoir written by his more famous mother, Ella Reeve Bloor, in 1940: [...] As a boy he loved the outdoors, was full of restless, eager {{vitality}} and bold curiosity. He had a startlingly vivid imagination, and an urge and talent for organizing that continued and marked his whole life. More than ordinarily shy, he forgot his shyness when engaged {{in one of his}} organizing ventures, and a flow of colorful, stirring talk would come from him so persuasive that those who heard him were completely carried away. He grew slim and tall, and when we moved to Arden was captain of the baseball team and a leader in tennis and other games.

2500|$|In 1947, child {{neuropsychiatrist}} Lauretta Bender {{published a}} study on 98 children aged between four and eleven years old who had been treated in {{the previous five years}} with intensive courses of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). These children received ECT daily for a typical course of approximately twenty treatments. This formed part of an experimental trend amongst a cadre of psychiatrists to explore the therapeutic impact of intensive regimes of ECT, which is also known as either regressive ECT or annihilation therapy. In the 1950s Bender abandoned ECT as a therapeutic practice for the treatment of children. In the same decade the results of her published work on the use of ECT in children was discredited after a study showing that the condition of the children so treated had either not improved or deteriorated. Commenting on his experience as part of Bender's therapeutic program, Ted Chabasinski said that, [...] "It really made a mess of me ... I went from being a shy kid who <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to a terrified kid who cried all the time." [...] Following his treatment, he spent ten years as an inmate of Rockland State Hospital, a psychiatric facility now known as the Rockland Psychiatric Center.|$|E

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} his life, in 1562, Marroquin left in {{his will}} some funds to set up a school, the Santo Tomás de Aquino, where [...] Grammar, Arts, Philosophy and Theology would be taught. The {{beneficiaries}} of this pious enterprise would be the children of poor Spaniards, given that they could not travel to cities (like Mexico) where the Royal Universities were. This will has been also interpreted by scholars as the origin of the University of San Carlos. However, the late priest had a clear idea of the difference between a school (i.e., a home for students, with or without classes) and a university (or General Study) where the students earned degrees. About this, historian John Tate Lanning tells that [...] "his will is so well known that there are some scholars that have not even seen it and have already <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of things that are not there at all. Nowhere in his will Marroquín talks about any university, much less talk about his intentions to establish one..."

Pisemsky described the years he spent there in Chapter 2 of People of the Forties, an autobiographical novel in which he figured under the name of Pasha. Fond of hunting and horseback riding, the boy received scant education: his tutors were a local deacon, a defrocked drunkard, and a strange old man who was known to have toured the area for decades, giving lessons. Aleksey learned reading, writing, arithmetics, Russian and Latin from them. In his autobiography Pisemsky wrote: [...] "Nobody had ever forced me to learn, and I wasn't an avid learner, but I <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> and that was my passion: by 14 I consumed, in translation, of course, most of Walter Scott's novels, Don Quixote, Gil Blas, Faublas, Le Diable boiteux, The Serapion Brethren, a Persian novel called Haggi Baba... As for children's books, I couldn't stand them and, as far as I remember now, considering them very silly." [...] Pisemsky wrote scornfully of his primary education and regretted failing to learn any languages besides Latin. He found in himself, however, a natural predisposition to mathematics, logic and aesthetics.|$|E
