40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} polymer composite laminates {{have become}} a standard material in applications were a high stiffness and high strength are required at minimal weight. Nevertheless, delamination between <b>reinforcing</b> <b>plies</b> and brittle matrix fracture remain the most important failure modes that are encountered in service for laminated composite materials. Although traditional solutions exist to toughen the interlaminar region between <b>reinforcing</b> <b>plies,</b> these systems often have important disadvantages which makes it too difficult to apply them to industrial scale. Recently, electrospun nanofibers have been suggested as an interlaminar toughening method {{which is much more}} viable as the electrospinning is relatively straightforward and scalable while the nanofibers do not affect the composite production process. Nevertheless, although the expected benefits are numerous, the research on composite laminates enhanced with electrospun nanofibrous veils is still very limited. A thorough understanding of the micromechanical fracture mechanisms and the parameters to obtain toughened composites have not been determined as of yet, but it is crucial in order to advance the research into these materials. In this presentation we would like to provides such insights by analyzing the nanofiber toughening effect on three different levels simultaneously for several nanofiber types: (i) the nano reinforced epoxy level, (ii) the interlaminar level and (iii) the laminate level. It was found that each level corresponds to certain (micro) mechanisms that result in a toughening effect. The bridging of microcracks by electrospun nanofibers is the main toughening mechanisms present on all levels. Nevertheless, the obtained increase in interlaminar fracture toughness on the interlaminar and laminate level is dependent on many more parameters which have been overlooked until now and are exposed by our multiscale analysis. In this presentation emphasis will be given on the effect of the mechanical properties of the nanofiber and how it influences the fracture toughness of the composites on these different levels...|$|R

The reflectivity of built up roofs depends on the surfacing material used. Gravel is the most common and they are referred to as asphalt and gravel roofs. Asphalt degradation is a growing concern. UV-rays oxidize the surface of the asphalt and produce a chalk-like residue. As plasticizers leach out of the asphalt, asphalt built-up roofs become brittle. Cracking and alligatoring inevitably follows, allowing water to penetrate the system causing blisters, cracks and leaks. Compared to other systems, installation of asphalt roofs is energy-intensive (hot processes typically use LP gas as the heat source), and contributes to atmospheric air pollution (toxic, and green-house gases are lost from the asphalt during installation).|$|R

Although fiber-reinforced polymer composites show many advantages {{compared to other}} materials, delamination between <b>reinforcing</b> <b>plies</b> remains a major problem limiting further breakthrough. Traditional solutions that have been proposed to toughen the interlaminar region between <b>reinforcing</b> <b>plies</b> have already reached their limit or have important disadvantages such as a high cost or the need for adapted production processes. Recently, electrospun nanofibers have been suggested as a more viable interlaminar toughening method. Although the expected benefits are numerous, the research on composite laminates enhanced with electrospun nanofibrous veils is still very limited. The work {{that has been done}} so far is almost exclusively focused on interlaminar fracture toughness tests with different kinds of nanofibers, where typically a trial and error approach has been used. A thorough understanding of the micromechanical fracture mechanisms and the parameters to obtain toughened composites has not been reported as of yet, but it is crucial to advance the research and design highly damage-resistant composites. This article provides such insight by analyzing the nanofiber toughening effect on three different levels for several nanofiber types. Only by combining the results from different levels, a thorough understanding can be obtained. These levels correspond to the hierarchical nature of a composite: the laminate, the interlaminar region, and the matrix resin. It is found that each level corresponds to certain mechanisms that result in a toughening effect. The bridging of microcracks by electrospun nanofibers is the main toughening mechanism resulting in damage resistance. Nevertheless, {{the way in which the}} nanofiber bridging mechanism expresses itself is different for each scale and dependent on parameters linked to a certain scale. The multiscale analysis of the toughening mechanisms reported in this paper is therefore crucial for understanding the behavior of nanofiber toughened composites, and as such allows for designing novel, damage-resistant, nanofiber-toughened materials...|$|R

In contrast, this study shows that interlaminar toughness can be increased without negatively affecting other properties by coating the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>plies</b> with a bisphenol A based thermoplastic polyester if some precautions are taken in mind. The polyester was added to an epoxy resin in order to study its effect on the thermophysical properties and fracture toughness of the bulk epoxy. The polyester molecules acted as a plasticizer for the epoxy resin when the polyester was added in low amounts. This increased the bulk fracture toughness of the epoxy resin by 30 %. Polyester modified glass/epoxy laminates were produced and tested for Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness and flexural properties. The increased toughness of the epoxy matrix led to a 60 % increased Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness of the laminates, without negatively affecting flexural stiffness and strength of the laminates...|$|R

Interleaving composites with electrospun nanofibrous veils is proving to be a viable technique in order to increase the delamination resistance. The veils can easily be placed in the resin rich interlayers prior to production and do not require a dispersion in the matrix resin such as traditional particle toughening techniques. Furthermore, they are easily produced by electrospinning. Although there are many expected obvious benefits, the research on composites toughened with electrospun nanofibres is still very limited. We will give thorough insight into the toughening micromechanisms that are present in laminates interleaved with nanofibrous veils. The bridging of microcracks by nanofibres is shown to be the main mechanism resulting in an increased interlaminar fracture toughness. Upon crack extension, nanofibres will bridge the newly formed crack surfaces and take up energy by straining, yielding and fracture. Several parameters are identified which influence this nanofibre bridging, and thus the observed interlaminar fracture toughness.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{summarizes}} {{results of}} a theoretical and experimental study on the nonlinear deformation behavior of thermoplastic matrix composites. The experimental work focuses on the processing and characterization of laminates of AS 4 graphite/poly-phenylene sulfide (PPS), E glass/PPS, and graphite/PPS-glass/PPS hybrids. The theoreti-cal study develops a generic material constitutive model applicable for all thermoplastic matrix composites that exhibit nonlinear stress-strain response. On the lamina level, a stress-based nonlinear stress-strain model for a unidirectionally <b>reinforced</b> <b>ply</b> {{is transformed into a}} mixed stress/strain-based model. Then, a model for the nonlinear material response of a multi-directional laminate is developed. The laminate model pre-dicts the nonlinear compliances based on the current effective laminate stresses and strains, and does so without need for iteration. In these models, the full three-dimensional stress and strain states have been retained so the models are applicable for both thin and thick section composites. While the three-dimensional nature of the models is discussed in detail elsewhere [1], the emphasis of the present paper is on the nonlinear deformation response. There is good agreement between the theoretical predictions and experimental results for laminates of graphite/PPS, glass/PPS, and their hybrids. The paper also pre-sents scanning electron micrographs to portray microscopic failure modes that may cause additional, damage-induced, nonlinear response in these laminates. 1...|$|R
40|$|To reduce {{development}} and certification costs for composite aircraft structures, efficient computational methods {{are required by}} the industry to predict structural integrity and failure under dynamic loads, such as crash and impact. Failure in polymer composites is initiated at the microscopic level, with length scales governed by fibre diameters, whilst the length scale of aircraft structures is in metres, which poses a severe challenge for FE analyses of composite structures. By using meso-scale models based on continuum damage mechanics (CDM), proposed by Ladevèze and co-workers [1], [2], {{it is possible to}} define materials models for FE codes at the structural macro level which embody the salient micromechanics failure behaviour. CDM provides a framework within which in-ply and delamination failures may be modelled.

The {{geometry of the}} composite is idealized as two dimensional, isotropic, linearly elastic media made of a damaged layer bonded between two half planes and separated by thin interleaves of low extensional and shear moduli.

Fourier integral transform techniques are used to develop solutions in terms of singular integral equations. An asymptotic analysis of the integral equations based on Muskhelishvili's techniques reveals logarithmically singular axial stresses in the half plane at the crack tips for the broken layer. For the H shaped crack, similar singularities are found to exist in the axial stresses at the interface crack tips in the layer and the half plane.

The proposed sensing system allows the simultaneous measurement of both temperature and strain by monitoring the change in reflected wavelength from two coupled fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors that have been embedded into the composite laminate. Instrumented GFRP laminates with 12, 18 and 24 <b>reinforcing</b> <b>plies,</b> respectively, were prepared {{by means of the}} vacuum bagging technique.

The obtained results, combined with proper data post-processing, have proven the effectiveness and potentiality of the proposed sensing system to measure the progression of the composite cure kinetics. It was shown that temperature within the specimen can differ significantly from the set-point temperature inside the oven because of the heat released during the exothermal reticulation of the epoxy resin. The combined sensing system also allowed the residual strain accumulated within the composite during the cooling stage to be accurately measured.

Although fiber reinforced polymer composites show many advantages {{compared to other}} materials, delamination between <b>reinforcing</b> <b>plies</b> remains a major problem limiting further breakthrough. Previous work has shown that electrospun nanofibers can significantly improve the interlaminar fracture toughness of fiber reinforced composites thus preventing delaminations. In the present paper, {{the effect of the}} morphology of the toughening polymer is analyzed by incorporating different polycaprolactone structures in the interlaminar regions. Both Mode I and Mode II interlaminar facture toughness of composites containing five different electrospun morphologies - nanofibers, microfibers, microspheres, dense films, and PCL spray coated glass fibers - were evaluated. Analyzing the fracture behavior of the PCL toughened laminates ensures a better insight in the micro mechanical fracture mechanisms behind the observed interlaminar fracture toughness and results in guidelines on the optimal interleave morphology. The results clearly demonstrate the distribution of PCL in the interlayer has a large effect on the crack path of the delamination and the resulting interlaminar fracture toughness. In order to improve the interlaminar fracture toughness in both Mode I as well as Mode II without adverse effects, porous PCL structures such as PCL nanofibers, microfibers, and micro spheres are much more suitable than non-porous structures such as PCL films or spray-coated glass fibers. Among the porous structures, the nanofibers had an overall better performance with an increase in Mode I and Mode II interlaminar fracture toughness of about 60 % and 80 % respectively.

Elastic strain measurements derived from the Hopkinson bar analysis are checked, using strain gauges attached directly to the specimen and the validity of the elastic moduli determined under tensile impact is confirmed. Epoxy specimens reinforced with plain-weave fabrics of either carbon or glass or with several hybrid combinations of the two in various lay-ups, giving five different weight fractions of reinforcement from all-carbon to all-glass, have been tested in tension at three strain rates, nominally, ~ 10 - 3 /s, ~ 10 /s and ~ 10 3 /s. The effect of both hybrid composition (volume fraction of carbon <b>reinforced</b> <b>plies)</b> and applied strain rate on the tensile modulus, the tensile strength and the strain to fracture is determined and a limited hybrid effect is observed in specimens with a carbon volume fraction in the approximate range 0. 6 to 0. 7 where, at all three strain rates there is an enhancement of the failure strain over that for the all-carbon plies and an increased failure strength, most marked in the impact tests, over that predicted by the rule of mixtures. The fracture surfaces of specimens are examined by optical and scanning electron microscopy and the failure process in the hybrid composites is related to that found in the all-carbon and the all-glass specimens.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties and fracture mechanics {{of a series}} of short glass fibre reinforced and rubber toughened polypropylene composite grades has been studied. The microstructural characteristics of composite grades were examined and, through appropriate models, related to the observed {{mechanical properties}}. The moulded material was modelled as being composed of fibre <b>reinforced</b> <b>plies</b> of varying average fibre orientation. The rubber was distributed uniformly throughout the specimens. The main effect of the rubber was to reduce the stiffness of the matrix and hence also the efficiency of the load transfer at the fibre/matrix interface {{while at the same time}} improving the fracture toughness and critical strain energy release rate of the matrix. Automated image analysis has been used to characterise the rubber particles' size, shape and distribution, and glass fibres' length and orientation distributions. The fibre/matrix interface has been studied using a novel single fibre fragmentation technique. Iterative computer simulations have been developed to accurately predict the stress-strain response of the various grades. The fracture mechanics properties of this series of materials are highly strain rate sensitive. At low strain rates the addition of glass fibres reduces the toughness of the material because the fibres act as discontinuities within the matrix, aiding initiation and propagation of a crack. At higher strain rates the fibres toughen the material by increasing the energy dissipation associated with fibre pull-out. These effects result in changes in the fracture surface morphology. Fibres pulled-out at low strain rates had clean surfaces. At higher strain rates the surfaces of pulled-out fibres were coated in an adherent sheath of matrix material. These effects are considered to be a consequence of the viscoelastic nature of the matrix. At low strain rates the matrix deforms plastically.

The main advantages of composites are their high specific strength and stiffness coupled with tailorability of properties. Laminated composites with unidirectionally <b>reinforced</b> <b>plies</b> {{are the most popular}} form of composites that allows high volume fraction of fibers and therefore achieves high utilization of fiber properties. However, laminated composites are prone to delaminate due to edge stresses and under impact. Existing methods of delamination suppression resulted in significant weight or cost penalties. The goal of this dissertation was systematic evaluation and analysis of dynamic fracture behavior of novel laminated composites with nanoreinforced interfaces. ^ Novel methods were developed for quantitative dynamic interlaminar fracture analysis under Mode I, Mode II and Mixed Mode loadings. Crack propagation was evaluated in specimens with and without nanofiber reinforcement. Significant improvements in fracture resistance were observed as a result of nanoreinforcement. Several unusual dynamic effects were observed for the first time. In particular, a possibility of suppression of ultrafast intersonic Mode II crack into the subsonic regime as a result of nanoreinforcement was demonstrated. It was also shown that a single dynamic experiment on a newly developed Mixed Mode test specimen may provide critical dynamic fracture resistance parameters for a broad range of mode mixities, a potentially highly efficient new method of dynamic material fracture characterization. Demonstration of applicability of the dynamic results from such a test for complex transient laminate delamination analysis was performed. A numerical model for composite laminate subjected to side impact was developed. The model utilized the data from the new Mixed Mode test. Laminate delamination under impact was studied numerically and significant reduction in delamination area was demonstrated as a result of nanoreinforcement. Simulated delamination areas and shapes correlated well with the ones obtained by ultrasonic analysis. The results of this work provide new insights into dynamic fracture behavior of advanced structural composites.

Assuming a harmonic time-dependent response, the problem is transformed into an eigenvalue problem, which can be solved in a numerically rather efficient manner. The numerical scheme is applied to an analysis of the effect of the face sheet anisotropy induced by fibre angle variations in laminated face sheets consisting of unidirectionally infinite fibre <b>reinforced</b> carbon epoxy <b>plies.</b> Further anisotropy effects derive from the use of honeycomb cores with anisotropy transverse shear moduli. It is observed that anisotropy of core and face sheets may have distinct effects on the lower natural frequencies...|$|R

The non-crimp 3 D woven fabric composite, loaded in both principal in-plane directions (warp and fill), shows the best quasi-static tensile properties and, when loaded in the fill direction, exhibits much longer fatigue life than its laminated plain weave counterpart. During both quasi-static and fatigue loading, the latest damage initiation is observed for the 3 D woven composite in both in-plane directions. The PW laminate develops delamination between the plies for each maximum stress in the cycle considered. Contrary to that, the 3 D composite is not affected by delamination neither under quasi-static nor under fatigue loading conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|The mil fabric {{reinforcement}} {{can be applied}} on the rubber products with different processes. For straight hoses the most used processes are braiding, spiralling, knitting and wrapping. The first three processes have in common that multiple strands of fibres are applied to the product simultaneously on a predetermined pattern in an automated process. The fourth process comprises manual or semi-automated wrapping of rubber sheets <b>reinforced</b> with fabric <b>plies.</b> For the reinforcement of complex shaped rubber products like bellows most manufacturers use these fabric reinforced rubber sheets. These sheets are made by calendering of rubber onto pre-woven fabric plies. The products are manufactured by wrapping (mostly manually) these sheets around a mandrel until enough rubber and reinforcement is applied. However, the disadvantage of using these sheets {{is that it is}} impossible to control the positioning of the individual fibres of the fabric when applied on complex shapes. Therefore, no geodesic paths can be achieved and therefore also no isotensoid loading is possible. To obtain isotensoide loading on a complex shape, the shape must have an isotensoideal profile and geodesic positioning of the fibre structure is required. This can be achieved by using automated winding processes like filament winding or spiralling.|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} light weight {{structural}} materials with good resistance to fatigue has led designers of aerospace industry to increasingly employ CFRP structures, when especially cyclic loading is of primary concern. The composite laminate {{in this study}} is composed of multidirectional Carbon Fiber <b>Reinforced</b> Plastic <b>plies</b> (CFRP) with varying fiber orientations. The first section of the study focuses on the numerical modelling of quasi-static mixed mode damage of the multidirectional CFRP laminates. The effect of varying fiber orientations, different stacking sequences and combination of inter- and intralaminar damage modes on the mixed mode delamination failure of the constituent have been investigated numerically and experimentally. In the numerical FE model, each CFRP lamina is assumed as an orthotropic homogenized continuum under plane stress, permitting the modelling of damage initiation in each ply under the combination of longitudinal (in fiber direction), transverse and shear stress states. The interface elements, lying in the delmaination plane, are represented via the cohesive zone concept. A general constitutive law connects the traction vector to the vector of displacement discontinuities and an isotropic damage variable degrades this interfacial traction until the interface element totally fails [1]. This interfacial damage behaviour is implemented as a user defined element routine (UEL) in ABAQUS. The second part of the study includes the simulation of mixed mode delamination of multidirectional laminates under cyclic loads. Under cyclic loading, the interface damage model must count for subcritical stiffness degradation and damage accumulation during each unloading-reloading step [2]. This is achieved by adding the fatigue damage law, established by the evolution of the damage variable in terms of the crack growth rate (da/dN), to the constitutive behaviour of the cohesive element developed previously (the mentioned UEL). The obtained numerical results are validated successfully by comparison with the conducted experiments. Finally, scanning electron microscopy was also used for distinguishing the features of the fracture surfaces and to establish the differences between static and fatigue fracture, as well as the differences between the various modes of fracture in different multidirectional lay-ups. ...|$|R

The composite consisted of a PolyPhenylene Sulfide (PPS) thermoplastic matrix (Fortron's PPS - Ticona 0214 B 1 powder) <b>reinforced</b> with 16 <b>plies</b> of carbon-fiber unidirectional tape, [0 ?/ 90 ?/+ 45 ?/- 45 ?] 2 S. The carbon fiber was Hexcel AS- 4 C and was present in a fiber volume of 53 % (60 %, by weight). The overall goal of the project, which {{is sponsored by the}} U. S. Department of Energy's Office of Freedom Car and Vehicle Technologies and is closely coordinated with the Advanced Composites Consortium, is to develop durability-driven design data and criteria to assure the long-term integrity of carbon-fiber-based composite systems for automotive structural applications. This document is in two parts. Part 1 provides design data and correlations, while Part 2 provides the underlying experimental data and models. The durability issues addressed include the effects of short-time, cyclic, and sustained loadings; temperature; fluid environments; and low-energy impacts (e. g., tool drops and kickups of roadway debris) on deformation, strength, and stiffness.
