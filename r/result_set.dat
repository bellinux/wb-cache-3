[...] For example, irregular {{internal rate of return}} (XIRR), a financial function, operates on a collection of cash flow values from one column, but must also apply variable period lengths from another column and an initial iterative assumption from a third, in order to return a single, summarizing value. [...] WestClinTech documentation notes that Range Queries specify the data {{to be included in the}} <b>result</b> <b>set</b> of the function independently of the WHERE clause associated with the T-SQL statement, by incorporating a SELECT statement into the function as a string argument; the function then traps that SELECT statement, executes it internally and processes the result.|$|E

Also we got out some necessary stores, including paraffin for the swinging lamps with which the ship was fitted in case of accident to the electric light, candles, and the guns we had brought with us so that they might be handy in the event of attack. This done, by the aid of the tools that were in the storerooms, Bickley, who was an excellent carpenter, repaired the saloon door, all that was necessary to keep us private, as the bulkhead still remained.|$|E

"Greatly as {{time and}} {{suffering}} have altered him in many respects, {{there is no}} change, Valeria, in the aversion--the horror I may even say--with which he views your idea of inquiring anew into the circumstances which attended the lamentable death of his first wife. It makes no difference to him that you are only animated {{by a desire to}} serve his interests. 'Has she given up that idea? Are you positively sure she has given up that idea?' Over and over again he has put these questions to me. I have answered--what else could I do in the miserably feeble state in which he still lies?--I have answered in such a manner as to soothe and satisfy him. I have said, 'Relieve your mind of all anxiety on that subject: Valeria {{has no choice but to}} give up the idea; the obstacles in her way have proved to be insurmountable--the obstacles have conquered her.' This, if you remember, was what I really believed would happen when you and I spoke of that painful topic; and I have heard nothing from you since which has tended to shake my opinion in the smallest degree.

In particular, collaborative filtering, an effective personalization technique that uses peer opinions to recommend items of interest, has not been widely used in Web search engines nor have the benefits of collaborative filtering to search engine technology been thoroughly evaluated. We have designed and implemented a search engine called Foible that personalizes Web searches based on user preferences and uses collaborative filtering to enhance the <b>result</b> <b>sets</b> returned from user queries. Through a carefully designed user study, we evaluate the effectiveness of Web search with personalization results and collaborative filtering compared with a traditional Web search engine. We find Web search results based on personalization and collaborative filtering provides <b>result</b> <b>sets</b> more closely related to user interests that <b>result</b> <b>sets</b> returned by traditional search engines.
