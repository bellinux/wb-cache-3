Of particular focus in this debate has been the high to very high <b>P-E</b> <b>ratios</b> assigned to companies that by any other measure seemed to be performing poorly. There {{is a need for}} an analysis that considers the whole market, rather than segmenting it, and that attempts to establish relationships based on intrinsic value indicators of companies. The reason for considering the whole market is to gain a market wide perspective, thus avoiding the peculiarities of segments of the market. There is also a need to do this, specifically, {{in the context of the}} JSE. In trying to address the points raised above, this report set out to determine the relationship between different levels of <b>P-E</b> <b>ratio</b> values and Percentage Sales Growth, as well as the value addition spread for the JSE. The difference between the return on invested capital and the capitalization rate was used as the value addition spread, since it provides an unbiased measure of the use of deployable capital. The findings of the report were that the relationship between these variables is obscure and cannot be captured in a iii multiple regression relationship. The conclusion arrived at was that the relationship between the <b>P-E</b> <b>ratio</b> and intrinsic market value indicators is not apparent in the South African environment...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} the first attempt to {{investigate}} the factors fundamental to {{the setting of the}} price–earnings (P–E) multiple for the Australian stock market. The quarterly <b>P–E</b> <b>ratio</b> for the ASX 200 index is used as a measure of the market wide P–E multiple. It is demonstrated that {{a large portion of the}} variation in the P–E multiple can be explained by the dividend payout ratio, interest rates and GDP growth rates. In addition, consumers 2 ̆ 7 confidence—a leading indicator of future growth opportunities, the Australian–US exchange rate—a key determinant of the competitiveness of domestic companies, and volatility of domestic market returns—a risk factor, have incremental explanatory power. <br /...|$|R

These are rationalized {{in terms of}} conformational preferences associated with the <b>relative</b> <b>P-E</b> and phosphorus-lone pair orientations. The complexes [M(CO) 4 {(Ph 2 P) 2 C=CHR}] (M = Mo or W, R = Me or Ph) have also been prepared and have NMR parameters which can be accounted for similarly. The crystal structure of (Ph 2 P) 2 C=CHMe has been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and shows that the solid-state conformation {{is similar to that}} deduced in solution on the foregoing basis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present the Business Management Intelligence (BMI) tools. The BMI tools provide the asset analysis, the {{liability}} analysis, equity analysis, costing analysis, sales analysis, profit analysis, business need and risk analysis. Moreover, The BMI tools can provide {{help for the}} business management in the decision making process. The BMI tools {{can be used by}} the investors such as the stockholders to analyze the profitability and risk level of the business besides providing information about the revenue and <b>P-E</b> <b>ratio.</b> Furthermore, the BMI tools can help creditors such as the bank loan officers analyze the liquidity and solvency of the business. BMI tools can be used independently or customized and integrated with certain systems such as the company-wide management information syste...|$|R
40|$|Pro forma is {{originated}} from Latin. It contains different meaning {{depends on which}} discipline it is used. In accounting, pro forma disclosure is used to show effect of important transaction which occurs {{after the end of}} periods, or which occurs during period but not fully reflected in historical cost financial statement of a firm. Pro forma disclosure has the objective to support (but might mislead) investor in decision making focused on particular influence of important transaction. Company with low GAAP profit information; less profitable company and has higher level of debt but more liquid, whose <b>P-E</b> <b>ratio</b> and market to book is higher than other companies in the industry; has the tendency to do pro forma disclosure. Pro forma disclosure has been supported by several theories such as: efficient market theory, catering theory, agency theory, signaling theory, and stakeholder theory. However, there are problems in reporting pro forma figures. There is no standard to it. Therefore, information on pro forma disclosure might also mislead less sophisticated investor...|$|R
40|$|Liquidity is the {{pre-condition}} for a well-functioning {{and efficient}} market. Liquidity can be perceived, but {{difficult to measure}} due to its multi-dimensional characteristics. Studies have discussed various characteristics of liquidity and its influencing power on return and asset pricing. The article has considered Indian MidCap stocks and measured its liquidity using Amihud and trading volume as proxies. It has found Indian MidCap stocks have varying degree of liquidity. During the intraday, MidCap stocks have L-shaped liquidity pattern. The article observed that <b>P-E</b> <b>ratio,</b> P-B ratio, Dividend Yield and Index of Industrial Production are the significant determinants of liquidity. The article has estimated liquidity betas and carried out Granger non-causality test to articulate its relation with CAPM beta. The article has also found stability of liquidity beta across MidCap stocks. The liquidity betas of MidCap stocks have time-varying volatility. Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Change in Trading Volume are exogenous variables in explaining the time-varying volatility of beta. The study observed that MidCap stocks are claiming liquidity premium and liquidity premium is influencing the asset pricing along with WML, HML and EMR factors...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} descriptive {{evidence on the}} controversial trend adopted by many firms in recent years of reporting earnings figures on a pro forma basis. pro forma earnings exclude normal income statement items that managers deem to be nonrecurring or nonrepresentative of ongoing operations. We examine a large sample of actual pro forma press releases issued between January 1998 and December 2000. We find that pro forma announcers tend to be relatively “young” firms that are concentrated primarily in the tech sector and business services industries, {{and that they are}} significantly less profitable, more liquid, and have higher debt levels, <b>P‐E</b> <b>ratios,</b> and book‐to‐market ratios than other firms in their own industries. Our results indicate that while firms commonly exclude multiple expenses in arriving at their pro forma earnings figure, they usually do not exclude the same items in subsequent pro forma announcements. These results support the criticism that pro forma announcements are often motivated by managers 2 ̆ 7 desires to meet or beat analysts 2 ̆ 7 expectations or to avoid earnings decreases...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{have criticized}} Professor Siegel for being bullish {{on the stock}} market back in 2000. In a BusinessWeek {{interview}} in May 2000 when asked about the stock market, he replied:"Seven percent per year average real returns on stocks is what I find over nearly two centuries. I don't see persuasive reasons why it should be any different from that over the intermediate run. In the short run, it could be almost anything."That being said, Professor Siegel was spot on when he also said in the same interview:"I have voiced my concern about the technology sector, and I sometimes advise people to shade down from that sector relative to its percentage in the & Poor's 500-stock index. I really am concerned with these companies that have <b>p-e</b> <b>ratios</b> of 90, 100, and above. I still think stocks, as a diversified portfolio, are the best long-run investment. I will say that indexed bonds at 4% are an attractive hedge at the present time. To get a 4% real rate of return, although it's not as high as 6.5% to 7% that we talked about in stocks, as a guaranteed rate of return is certainly comforting against any inflation." ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} part of this work, we present two methods for {{improving}} the shape-threat detection performance of x-ray computed tomography. Our work uses a fixed-gantry system employing 25 x-ray sources. We first utilize Kullback-Leibler divergence and Mahalanobis distance to determine the optimal single-source single-exposure measurement. The second method employs gradient search on Bhattacharyya bound on error rate (P-e) to determine an optimal multiplexed measurement that simultaneously utilizes all available sources in a single exposure. With limited total resources of 10 (6) photons, the multiplexed measurement provides a 41. 8 x reduction in <b>P-e</b> <b>relative</b> to the single-source measurement. In the second part, we consider multiple exposures and develop an adaptive measurement strategy for x-ray threat detection. Using the adaptive strategy, we design the next measurement based on information retrieved from previous measurements. We determine both optimal "next measurement" and stopping criterion to insure a target P-e using sequential hypothesis testing framework. With adaptive single-source measurements, we can reduce P-e by a factor of 40 x relative to the measurements employing all sources in sequence. We also observe that there is a trade-off between measurement SNR and number of detectors when we study the performance of systems with reduced detector numbers.

40|$|There is {{renewing}} {{evidence that}} the Tropics might strongly influence climate dynamics on millennial time-scales. Part of this "tropical forcing" is related {{to changes in the}} water cycle that impacts atmospheric and oceanic processes on a broad scale. Past variations of the continental hydrology are poorly documented due to the few available records and the lack of quantitative data on climate parameters. The deuterium/hydrogen ratio (&# 948;D) of algal derived biomarkers captures the isotopic composition of meteoric waters (Huang et al., 2002; Sachse et al., 2004). In turn, terrestria lly-derived biomarkers captures the isotopic composition of meteoric waters through their &# 948;D but with a strong influence of the evapotranspiration. A combination of these two factors should thus allow the quantification of the variations in relative humidity (i. e. precipitation-evaporation; P-E). We applied such an approach to estimate hydrological changes in Northern Brazil during the last 20, 000 yr. The &# 948;D of algal (n-C 18) and land plant (n-C 30) fatty acids (FA) have been measured on 30 samples selected on a 6 m long lacustrine sediment core. In a first approximation, we considered a mean hydrogen isotope fractionation of - 157 ~ between the n-C 18 FA and water and between the n-C 30 FA and water of - 128 ~ (e. g. Sachse et al., 2004). Because the amount of precipitation is the major control on the isotopic composition of meteoric waters in tropical systems, we used the &# 61540;Dwat-alg (&# 948;D of the water used by algae for lipid synthesis, estimated from the &# 948;D of the n-C 18 FA) as a proxy of precipitation amount. The &# 948;Dwat-hp (&# 948;D of the water used for land plant lipids synthesis) is measured from the &# 61540;D of the n-C 30 FA and used to estimate <b>relative</b> moisture (<b>P-E).</b> The difference in isotope fractionation between land plants and phytoplankton (&# 948;Dwat-hp - &# 948;Dwat-alg) is used to quantify evapotranspiration (evaporation from soils and transpiration from plants). These results allowed to distinguish five contrasted periods in our 20, 000 yr record (see below). The 20 - 19 kyr period is characterized by high precipitation associated with high evapotranspiration, i. e. a semi-arid climate. By comparison, from 19 to 17 kyrs, both precipitation and evapotranspiration are both reduced. The resulting climate is nevertheless dryer than during the previous stage. During the Lateglacial interval, i. e. from 17 up to 13. 5 kyrs, evapotranspiration is reduced but the precipitation which remains at the same level than before entails a more humid climate. The Younger Dryas interval (YD) shows higher precipitation levels but stronger evapotranspiration, thus a dryer climate than during the Lateglacial but nevertheless more humid than {{at the end of the}} Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Finally, the Holocene shows a decreasing trend in the amount precipitation and with few variations of the evapotranspiration that finally delineate a drying trend. These results are coherent with independent data produced by palynology and biomarker analysis (Ledru et al., 2001; Jacob et al., 2004) and give clue information on the variations in water cycling in the Tropics since the LGM...|$|R
