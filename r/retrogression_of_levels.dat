40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} define the {{normative}} nature {{and content of the}} prohibition <b>of</b> <b>retrogression</b> under the rules of international law, as applicable in Finland. Further, this thesis seeks to examine the effectiveness of the implementation and protection of social rights in Finland; in particular, the operation of the prohibition <b>of</b> <b>retrogression</b> in the Finnish system of constitutional review and human rights impact assessment. Under article 2 (1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and article 12 (3) of the European Social Charter, state parties are under an obligation to progressively realise a higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> social rights. The mirror principle of this requirement is the prohibition <b>of</b> <b>retrogression,</b> according to which a state cannot take any unnecessarily regressive steps in the realisation of social rights. Since the start of the European economic crisis in 2009, several European states have resorted to measures that have had a negative impact on the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> social rights in those states. Consequently, various supranational and national judicial organs have been required to examine the justifiability of those measures, thus clarifying the content of the prohibition <b>of</b> <b>retrogression.</b> From these decisions and statements it is possible to derive certain criteria for assessing compliance with the prohibition of retrogression: the regressive measure has to be temporary, it has to be necessary and proportionate, it cannot be discriminatory and the minimum core content of each respective rights has to be protected. The effectiveness of social rights {{can be seen as a}} tool for promoting equality, justice and democracy in society, as the effective enjoyment of social rights increases the participation of vulnerable groups within it. Therefore, compliance with the prohibition <b>of</b> <b>retrogression</b> is particularly crucial at times of economic recession in order to protect the rights of these most vulnerable groups. The effectiveness of social rights can be argued to consist of an effective monitoring system within a particular state, effective remedies for an individual, and the commitment of all public authorities to conduct a systematic human rights impact assessment on different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> decision-making. It is argued that through these mechanisms, compliance with the prohibition <b>of</b> <b>retrogression</b> could be sufficiently guaranteed. In Finland, the monitoring of the realisation of social rights is based on the competence of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Chancellor of Justice of the Government and various administrative authorities. Additionally, the supranational supervisory mechanisms, in particular the collective complaint procedure under the Additional Protocol to the European Social Charter, complement the domestic system of monitoring. Reviewing the constitutionality of new legislation has, however, traditionally fallen under the competence of the Constitutional Law Committee of the Parliament. The prohibition <b>of</b> <b>retrogression</b> is mainly <b>of</b> relevance in the ex ante constitutional review by the Constitutional Law Committee of the Parliament. In certain individual cases the prohibition can also be of relevance within the courts. This kind of ex post review by courts could, however, take place mainly through a human rights friendly interpretation or through the enforcement of subjective social rights. Due to the nature of the prohibition <b>of</b> <b>retrogression,</b> the norm should primarily be taken into account by the legislature before any decisions on potentially regressive measures have been made. The operation of the prohibition <b>of</b> <b>retrogression</b> in the Finnish system of constitutional review and human rights impact assessment can be seen as partly ineffective due to the fact that the budgetary decision-making is not subject to systematic human rights impact assessment. This means that while resource allocations in budget decisions may have a regressive impact on social rights, the requirements of the prohibition <b>of</b> <b>retrogression</b> are not being reviewed in this context. This cannot be seen as justifiable, considering that the prohibition <b>of</b> <b>retrogression</b> requires a state to conduct a sufficient analysis on the potential impacts on social rights and to explore alternative options in order to avoid negative impacts on the rights of the most vulnerable groups in the society...|$|R

40|$|The {{injection}} of Scharlach R {{into the skin}} about rabbit papillomas resulting from virus inoculation causes them to invade the underlying tissue and form large, fleshy masses beneath the surface. Histologically these appear malignant, and they frequently invade the blood vessels. Covering young papillomas {{with a layer of}} collodion causes them to burrow downwards with result in discoid masses which enlarge progressively, both by expansive growth beneath the epidermis and by invasion. Such masses, like the nodules resulting from implantation, have the papillae turned toward their interior, the apparent reverse of the condition of affairs when the growth is situated on the skin surface. The reasons for this are analyzed. The peculiarities of the host influence skin papillomas not a little, as is plain from the forms they assume; but the epithelial changes induced by the virus take a single direction, and no significant variations from type have been encountered. Local or generalized <b>retrogression</b> <b>of</b> the experimentally induced papilloma is not uncommon. The histological alterations that take place are identical with those attending <b>retrogression</b> <b>of</b> the epidermoid tumors, and the reactive changes taking place in the surrounding tissue are also like those about such tumors. The slowing and cessation of growth that occur secondarily in the case of virus-induced skin papillomas are associated with the formation under them of a dense layer of connective tissue, and to this their behavior is attributable. Similar findings have been often recorded for tumors, notably for the epidermoid cancers produced in rabbits by tarring...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY. Cordierite {{commonly}} alters to chlorite-sericite, called pinite. Besides pinite alteration, cordierite {{from the}} Fishtail Lake shows textural evidence indicating retrogression to kyanite, andalu-site, and coarse flakes of chlorite. This {{is consistent with}} the experimental data on the stability of cordierite and may be expected to be limited to potash-deficient rocks, such as the cordierite-garnet-gedrite bearing gneisses of the area. In common potash-bearing pelitic rocks, <b>retrogression</b> <b>of</b> cor-dierite results in the formation of sericite and chlorite. In gneisses containing sillimanite and cor-dierite, the breakdown of cordierite in this way results in the association of the three aluminosilicates (kyanite, andalusite, and sillimanite) in the same rock. The association of kyanite-andalusite n equilibrium probably suggests that the retrogrcss!on of cordierite took place close to the univariant line of kyanite-andalusite...|$|R
