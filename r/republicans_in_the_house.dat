5|$|In his {{decade in}} Congress, McEwen {{compiled}} a conservative voting record, usually scoring {{in the single}} digits in the annual Americans for Democratic Action ratings and 85% or higher in the American Conservative Union's similar polls, though McEwen was never {{one of the most}} conservative <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> nor the most conservative Republican in the Ohio delegation.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Lyndon Johnson led a {{landslide}} victory for his party, securing another term {{as president and}} taking 36 seats from <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Representatives. Following the election, members of the Republican caucus looked to select a new Minority Leader. Three members approached Ford {{to see if he}} would be willing to serve; after consulting with his family, he agreed. After a closely contested election, Ford was chosen to replace Charles Halleck of Indiana as Minority Leader.|$|E

Cantor voted in favor of a 90% marginal tax rate increase on taxpayer financed bonuses, despite receiving campaign contributions from TARP recipient Citigroup.|$|E
25|$|Ros-Lehtinen {{played a}} key role in keeping the International Protecting Girls by Preventing Child Marriage Act of 2010 from being passed into law. Although the bill had {{unanimously}} passed the Senate with bipartisan support, she persuaded enough <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> to vote against the bill so that it did not receive the required two-thirds majority. She reportedly invoked concerns about the legislation's cost and that funds could be used to promote abortion.|$|E
25|$|By 2017, nearly 70% {{of those}} on the exchanges could {{purchase}} insurance for less than $75/month after subsidies. The law was evaluated multiple times by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which scored it as a moderate deficit reducer, as it included tax hikes primarily on high income taxpayers (roughly the top 5%) and reductions in future Medicare cost increases, offsetting subsidy costs. No <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> and only a few in the Senate voted for the law.|$|E

25|$|By {{creating}} state-level marketplaces or exchanges, {{enough people}} could form pools to obtain cost-effective coverage. Furthermore, the law provided {{federal funding for}} states that chose to expand their Medicaid programs. The vast majority of congressional Democrats voted for the law, while no <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> {{and only a few}} in the Senate did so. Republicans, mainly in the House of Representatives, attempted on as many as 60 occasions to repeal, defund, or delay the law during Obama's tenure, but to no avail.|$|E
25|$|After Lincoln's assassination, Stanton {{remained}} as the Secretary of War {{under the new}} President Andrew Johnson during {{the first years of}} Reconstruction. He opposed the lenient policies of Johnson towards the former Confederate States. Johnson's attempt to dismiss Stanton ultimately led to President Johnson being impeached by the Radical <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Representatives. Stanton returned to law after retiring as Secretary of War, and in 1869 was nominated as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court by Johnson's successor, Ulysses S. Grant; however, he died four days after his nomination was confirmed by the Senate.|$|E
25|$|Michigan saw a {{sharp decline}} in the labor force {{starting}} in 2008 and lasting until 2011, which resulted in 800,000 jobs lost. In 2009, Michigan's unemployment rate hit a record-high 14.2 percent. During that same period Michigan saw its population base shrink. In 2011, Bolger worked with <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> to pass tax, education and pension reform measures, and employers have responded positively to the changes. Since the reforms were passed in 2011, more than 300,000 jobs returned to the state. During Bolger's time as Speaker from 2011 through 2014, Michigan had the fifth highest job growth in the nation, and the state's unemployment rate decreased to 6.7 percent.|$|E

25|$|President Obama pledged {{before he}} was elected not to raise taxes except on those couples earning over $250,000 (200,000 for individuals). With the Bush tax cuts {{extension}} scheduled to expire in January 2013, President Obama had significant leverage with the Republican Congress, as his veto of further extensions {{would have resulted in}} a sizable income tax increase across the income spectrum, a significant expansion of government, but contrary to his pledge. His compromise, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA), passed by a wide majority in the Senate, with both Democrats and Republicans supporting it, while a majority of <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> opposed it. It extended the Bush tax cuts for roughly the bottom 99% of income earners (those earning below $400,000, or $450,000 for married couples).|$|E
25|$|Watts ran for Congress in 1994 {{to succeed}} Dave McCurdy, who had {{announced}} his retirement from the House of Representatives {{to run for the}} Senate. He positioned himself as both a fiscal and social conservative, favoring the death penalty, school prayer, a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform, and opposing abortion, gay rights, and reduced defense spending. After a hard-fought primary campaign against state representative Ed Apple, Watts won 49percent to Apple's 48percent of the vote in August 1994, and 52percent in the resulting run-off election in September 1994 with the support of Representative Jack Kemp and actor and National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston. Watts started his race against the Democratic nominee, David Perryman, a white lawyer from Chickasha, with a wide lead in several early polls and 92percent name recognition in one poll. Watts hosted former President George H. W. Bush, U.S. Senator Bob Dole, and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich and focused on welfare reform and the necessity of capital formation and capital gains, as well as a reduction in the capital gains tax as beneficial for urban blacks. Some voters were expected to not vote for Watts because of race, but the editor of a local political newspaper argued Watts' established Christian conservative image and his popularity as a football player would help him win. On November 8, 1994, Watts was elected with 52percent of the vote as the first African-American Republican U.S. Representative from south of the Mason–Dixon line since Reconstruction. He and Gary Franks of Connecticut were the only two African-American <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House.</b> Oklahoma's Fourth District at the time was 90percent white and had been represented by Democrats since 1922.|$|E
500|$|The Liberal Republican {{movement}} {{lasted from}} 1870 to 1875 {{and at times}} {{it is difficult to}} distinguish between party members, both Democrat and Republican, who adopted all or parts of the Liberal Republican reform agenda. President Ulysses S. Grant signed the Amnesty Act of 1872, a Liberal Republican platform, that gave amnesty to former Confederates. Another instance occurred when the Democratic Party reluctantly and chaotically melded with the Liberal Republican Party in the presidential election of 1872, in support of the reformer, Horace Greeley. [...] The height of the Liberal Republican era in the U.S. Congress was from the periods of 1873 to 1875 with 7 Liberal Republicans in the Senate and 4 Liberal <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Representatives.|$|E

500|$|Some {{commentators}} have criticized Ryan's votes {{for what they}} believe were deficit-increasing policies during the George W. Bush administration as being inconsistent with fiscal conservatism. While he voted for the two Bush tax cuts (in 2001 and 2003), he also voted for the 2003 bill that created the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit, the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), and the $700 billion bank bailout, and Ryan was one of 32 <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> {{to vote for the}} auto industry bailout. In 2011 President Barack Obama criticized Ryan as [...] "not [...] on the level" [...] by describing himself as a fiscal conservative while voting for these policies, as well as two [...] "unpaid for" [...] wars. Columnist Ezra Klein wrote in 2012: [...] "If you know about Paul Ryan at all, you probably know him as a deficit hawk. But, Ryan has voted to increase deficits and expand government spending too many times for that to be his north star." ...|$|E
500|$|In May 1969, the Treasury sought {{authorization}} {{to eliminate the}} half dollar's silver content, changing it to the same copper-nickel clad composition as the dime and quarter. [...] The Treasury also sought approval to strike base-metal dollar coins, which would fill a need for gaming tokens in Western casinos. [...] Former president Dwight Eisenhower had died recently, and there was discussion of placing Eisenhower's portrait on the dollar. [...] The Treasury hoped that with {{the removal of the}} silver content, the coin would cease to be hoarded and again circulate. [...] Despite the support of President Richard Nixon, some <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Representatives initially scuttled the legislation, disliking the idea of putting Eisenhower on a base metal coin. [...] The dispute dragged on for over a year before Nixon signed a bill on December 31, 1970 which authorized the Eisenhower dollar and eliminated silver from the half dollar. [...] As a result of the delay, in 1970 non-proof half dollars were only made in Denver and released solely in mint sets. [...] With a mintage of 2.1 million the 1970-D Kennedy is considered the [...] "key" [...] to the series, although enough were produced to keep prices modest. The Mint did not announce that 1970 half dollars would not be struck for circulation until after mint set ordering had closed.|$|E

2500|$|Traditionally, the Speaker is {{reckoned}} as {{the leader}} of the majority party in the House, with the Majority Leader as second-in-command. For instance, when the Republicans gained the majority in the House after the 2010 elections, Eric Cantor succeeded Boehner as Majority Leader. [...] Despite this, Cantor and his successor, Kevin McCarthy, have been reckoned as the second-ranking <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> since Boehner is still reckoned {{as the leader}} of the House Republicans. However, there have been some exceptions. The most recent exception to this rule came when Majority Leader Tom DeLay generally overshadowed Speaker Dennis Hastert from 2003 to 2006.
