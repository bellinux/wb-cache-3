40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the trading activities of different investor types {{are related to}} common return and liquidity movements. Using a unique dataset, we decompose the daily return and liquidity of individual stocks into price impact components attributable to trades of institutional investors and retail investors. We then investigate the variation of each component relative to market-wide return and liquidity. We show that institutional trades contribute more than <b>retail</b> <b>trades</b> to liquidity commonality. However, <b>retail</b> <b>trades</b> contribute more strongly to return co-movement. The incremental contribution of <b>retail</b> <b>trades</b> to the co-variability of stock returns is more pronounced for firms with high information asymmetry...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine whether}} the <b>trading</b> {{activities}} of <b>retail</b> and institutional investors cause comovements in stock returns. Around stock splits, <b>retail</b> <b>trading</b> correlations (RTCs) decrease with {{stocks in the}} presplit price range and increase with stocks in the post-split price range. These shifts in RTCs induce changes in return comovements. In the cross section, return comovements among low-priced stocks are amplified when <b>retail</b> <b>trades</b> are more correlated and when aggregate uncertainty amplifies behavioral biases. We find similar patterns among local stocks and when firms change their corporate headquarters. In contrast to <b>retail</b> <b>trading,</b> institutional trading attenuates return comovements...|$|R
5|$|Sleaford was {{primarily}} an agricultural town until the 20th century, supporting a cattle market, with seed companies, such as Hubbard and Phillips, and Sharpes International Seeds, being {{established in the}} late 19th century. The arrival of the railway made the town favourable for malting. Industry has declined, and in 2011 the most common occupations are in wholesale and <b>retail</b> <b>trade,</b> health and social care, public administration and defence and manufacturing. Regeneration of the town centre {{has led to the}} redevelopment of the old industrial areas, including the construction of the National Centre for Craft & Design on an old wharf.|$|E
5|$|The 20th century brought {{improvements}} to energy and domestic systems: electrical service {{was introduced in}} 1915; and in 1941, just before World WarII, the town installed a water system. The construction of Interstate 81 (I-81) during the early 1960s depressed business development in the town. The wagon road, which had been made part of U.S. Route 11, had led traffic {{through the center of}} town, but the interstate passed less than a tenth of a mile to the east, drawing off development, <b>retail</b> <b>trade</b> and ultimately, businesses. This caused downtown to decline. Developers constructed new residential subdivisions both within and outside the town boundaries to the east for access to I-81.|$|E

5|$|The {{economy of}} the Croatian Littoral is largely {{centered}} on the city of Rijeka, whose economic impact is felt directly {{not only in the}} geographic region, but also in other parts of Primorje-Gorski Kotar Countyâ€”Gorski Kotar and Liburnia (modern region)â€”and a substantial part of Lika-Senj County. The most significant economic activities in the Primorje-Gorski Kotar County are transport, largely based on activities of the Port of Rijeka, shipbuilding and tourism in the coastal areas representing a part of the Northern Croatian Littoral, and forestry and wood processing in the Gorski Kotar region in the hinterland. In the city of Rijeka itself, the most significant economic activities are civil engineering, wholesale and <b>retail</b> <b>trade,</b> transport and storage services, and the processing industry.

5|$|By 1900, {{the lumber}} {{industry}} had declined, and the city's economic base rested on other industries, including a furniture factory, a paper mill, a fire brick plant, and a silk mill. In 1938, the Piper Aircraft Corporation, {{maker of the}} Piper Cub and other light aircraft, moved its production plant to Lock Haven. It remained one of the city's biggest employers until the 1980s, when, after major flood damage and losses related to Hurricane Agnes in 1972, it moved to Florida. The loss of Piper Aircraft contributed to an unemployment {{rate of more than}} 20% in Lock Haven in the early 1980s, though the rate had declined to about 9% by 2000. Another large plant, the paper mill that had operated since the 1880s in Castanea Township, closed in 2001. By 2005, 32% of the city's labor force was employed in health care, education, or social services, 16% in manufacturing, 14% in <b>retail</b> <b>trade,</b> 13% in arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services, and smaller fractions in other sectors.

The sector rebounded in 2010, becoming the country's largest sector by economic output and contributing 43.6% of the country's GDP. Key tertiary contributors include banking and finance, wholesale and <b>retail</b> <b>trade,</b> hotels and restaurants, transport, storage, communication, insurance, real estate, business services and public administration including education and health. Tourism {{is one of}} the fastest-growing economic resources and became the country's leading foreign exchange earner in 2007. In spite of the genocide's legacy, the country is increasingly perceived internationally as a safe destination. The number of tourist arrivals in 2013 was 864,000 people, up from 504,000 in 2010. Revenue from tourism was US$303million in 2014, up from just US$62million in 2000. The largest contributor to this revenue was mountain gorilla tracking, in the Volcanoes National Park; Rwanda is one of only two countries in which mountain gorillas can be visited safely; the gorillas attract thousands of visitors per year, who are prepared to pay high prices for permits. Other attractions include Nyungwe Forest, home to chimpanzees, Ruwenzori colobus and other primates, the resorts of Lake Kivu, and Akagera, a small savanna reserve in the east of the country.|$|E
