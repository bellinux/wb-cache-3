Such electronics have applications in down-hole drilling, automobile-, air- and space- industries. In this thesis, integrated circuits (ICs) in bipolar 4 H-SiC for high-temperature power applications are explored. In particular, device modelling, circuit design, layout design, and measurements are discussed for a range of circuits including operational amplifiers, linear voltage <b>regulators,</b> <b>drivers</b> for power switches, and power converters with integrated control. The circuits were demonstrated and tested from 25 °C up to 500 °C. Circuit design in bipolar SiC technology involves challenges such as the fabrication process’ uncertainties and incomplete models of the devices. Furthermore, high temperature modelling of the integrated devices is needed for circuit design and simulation. From the circuit design viewpoint, techniques such as negative-feedback, temperature-insensitive biasing, buffering and Darlington stages, and amplifiers with fewer gain stages, were shown to be useful for high-temperature IC design in bipolar SiC. It is shown that the linear voltage regulator can be improved by using a tailored high-current lateral Darlington power device in the same fabrication process. This results in a high temperature high current power supply solution. Moreover, the drivers can be improved by design in order to provide higher voltage levels and peak currents for the power devices (bipolar and MOSFET based). In addition, a DC-DC converter with fully integrated hysteretic control is designed taking advantage of several sub-circuits such as operational amplifier, Schmitt trigger and driver for the power switch.

Thus, the sense of sweet taste has evolved {{to serve as a}} {{dominant}} <b>regulator</b> and <b>driver</b> of feeding behavior. Although several sugar receptors have been described, it remains poorly understood how the sensory input is transformed into an appetitive behavior. Here, we used a neural silencing approach to screen brain circuits, and identified neurons labeled by three Ga 14 lines that modulate Drosophila feeding behavior. These three Ga 14 lines labeled neurons mainly in the suboesophageal ganglia (SOG), which is considered to be the fly&# 39;s primary taste center. When we blocked the activity of these neurons, flies decreased their sugar consumption significantly. In contrast, activation of these neurons resulted in enhanced feeding behavior and increased food consumption not only towards sugar, but to an array of food sources. Moreover, upon neuronal activation, the flies demonstrated feeding behavior {{even in the absence of}} food, which suggests that neuronal activation can replace food as a stimulus for feeding behavior. These findings indicate that these Ga 14 -labeled neurons, which function downstream of sensory neurons and regulate feeding behavior towards different food sources is necessary in Drosophila feeding control...|$|R
40|$|Multistage {{operational}} transconductance amplifier (OTA) {{has been}} a major research focus as a solution to high DC Gain high Gain Bandwidth and wide voltage swing requirement on sub-micron devices. These system requirements, in addition to ultra-large capacitive load drivability (nF-range load capacitor), are useful in applications including LCD drivers, low dropout (LDO) linear <b>regulators,</b> headphone <b>drivers,</b> etc. The major drawback of multistage OTAs is the stability concerns since each added stage introduces low frequency poles. Numerous compensation schemes for three stage OTAs have been proposed in the past decade with only a few four stage OTA in literature. The proposed design is a four stage OTA which uses an active zero block (AZB) to provide left half plane (LHP) zero to help with phase degradation. AZB is embedded in the second stage ensuring reuse of existing block hence providing area and power savings. This design also uses single miller capacitor in the outer loop which ensures improved speed performance with minimal area overhead. A very reliable slew helper is implemented in this design to help with the large signal performance. The slew helper is only operational in the events slewing and does not affect the small signal performance.

An A. gambiae tissue-specific enhancer derived from a serpin (SRPN 10) gene was utilized to control the temporal and spatial expression of doxycycline (dox) -sensitive transcriptional <b>regulators</b> in the <b>driver</b> lines. The "Tet-Off" driver utilized the tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activator (tTA) that is unable to bind and activate transcription from tetracycline operators (TetO) in the presence of dox; the "Tet-on" driver utilized the reverse tTA (rtTA) that, conversely, binds and activates TetO operators in the presence of dox. The responder lines carried insertions encompassing a LacZ reporter gene, cis-regulated by a TetO-P-element hybrid promoter. The progeny of crosses between driver and responder lines expressed beta-galactosidase under dual, tissue-specific and dox-mediated regulation. In adult rtTA/TetOPlacZ progeny, dox treatment rapidly induced beta-galactosidase activity throughout the midgut epithelium and especially in malaria parasite-invaded epithelial cells. Transactivator-dependent, dox-mediated regulation was observed in hemocytes and pericardial cells using both systems.

The near-space environment of balloons allows optics to perform near their diffraction limit. In practice, this implies that a telescope similar to the Hubble Space Telescope could be fl own for a cost of tens of millions as opposed to billions. While highly feasible, the design of a balloon telescope to rival Hubble is limited by funding. Until a prototype is proven and more support for balloon science is gained, projects remain limited in both hardware costs and man hours. Thus, to effectively create and support balloon payloads, engineering designs must be effcient, modular, and if possible reusable. This thesis focuses specifically on a modular power system design for the BRRISON comet-observing balloon telescope. Time- and cost-saving techniques are developed {{that can be used for}} future missions. In this thesis, a modular design process is achieved through the development of individual circuit elements that span a wide range of capabilities. Circuits for power conversion, switching and sensing are designed to be combined in any configuration. These include DC-DC <b>regulators,</b> MOSFET <b>drivers</b> for switching, isolated switches, current sensors and voltage sensing ADCs. Emphasis is also placed on commercially available hardware. Pre-fabricated DC-DC converters and an Arduino microcontroller simplify the design process and offer proven, cost-effective performance.

40|$|SummaryInvadopodia are protrusive {{structures}} used by {{tumor cells}} for {{degradation of the}} extracellular matrix to promote invasion [1]. Invadopodia formation and function are regulated by cytoskeletal-remodeling pathways and the oncogenic kinase Src. The guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav 1, which is an activator of Rho family GTPases, is ectopically expressed in many pancreatic cancers, where it promotes tumor cell survival and migration [2, 3]. We have now determined that Vav 1 is also a potent regulator of matrix degradation by pancreatic tumor cells as depletion of Vav 1 by siRNA-mediated knockdown inhibits the formation of invadopodia. This requires the exchange function of Vav 1 toward the GTPase Cdc 42, which is required for invadopodia assembly [4, 5]. In addition, we have determined that Src-mediated phosphorylation and activation of Vav 1 are both required for, and, unexpectedly, sufficient for, invadopodia formation. Expression of Vav 1 Y 174 F, which mimics its activated state, is a potent inducer of invadopodia formation through Cdc 42, {{even in the absence}} of Src activation and phosphorylation of other Src substrates, such as cortactin. Thus, these data identify a novel mechanism by which Vav 1 can enhance the tumorigenicity and invasive potential of cancer cells. These data suggest that Vav 1 promotes the matrix-degrading processes underlying tumor cell migration and further, under conditions of ectopic Vav 1 expression, that Vav 1 is a central <b>regulator</b> and major <b>driver</b> of invasive matrix remodeling by pancreatic tumor cells...|$|R
40|$|The thesis aims at {{developing}} {{approaches to}} transport policy decisions, based on suggestions and ideas originating from moral philosophy and philosophical decision theory. Paper I analyzes the Swedish transport policy goals, {{and the problem}} of combining policygoals with welfare economics. A problem of circularity arises as the Swedish transport policygoals are conflicting, and hence must be subject to trade-offs, while several of the goals themselves entail statements on how to prioritize or restrain goals in case of conflict. Paper II analyzes rationality in road safety policy. Problematic features are identified and discussed. The paper argues that the Swedish road safety goal is rational, since it is actionguiding and achievement-inducing. Paper III includes a model of rational choice under risk with biased risk perception. Under certain plausible conditions, a regulator should raise the population’s risk exposure. By deteriorating the environment the <b>regulator</b> can motivate <b>drivers</b> to choose behaviour that is less biased. Paper IV provides a formal representation of goal systems. The focus is on three properties:consistency, conflict, and coherence. It is argued that consistency is adequately regarded as a property relative to the decision situation or, more specifically, the set of alternatives that the agent faces. Conflict is adequately regarded as a relation over subsets of a given goal systemand should likewise be regarded as relative to the set of alternative that the agent faces. Coherence is given a probabilistic interpretation, based on a support relation over subsets of goal systems. Paper V investigates problems associated with standard deontic logic. A deontic predicate is derived, which avoids some of the major paradoxes in the area. In particular, paradoxes occurring when one obligation is derived by logical necessity from another obligation are dealt with. QC 2010080...|$|R
40|$|Polypeptide {{growth factor}} signaling, such as exerted by the Transforming Growth Factor type b (TGFb) family system, {{is crucial to}} steer several {{processes}} within cells, including cell proliferation and differentiation, cell survival and cell death, and cell migration in embryogenesis, but also in adult tissue homeostasis and repair. The many extracellular ligands of this family provide these cues via binding to surface receptor complexes that initiate a number of biochemical cascades, with a major one being dependent on the intracellular Smad proteins. The resulting intracellular set of signals ultimately shape a regulatory network of transcription, characterized by tight, temporal and precise control of target gene expression in ligand-stimulated cells. This intricate transcriptional network is, like many other operating regulations on TGFβ family signaling within these cells (e. g. receptor complex assembly, endocytosis of liganded receptors, controlled stabilization versus degradation of the components), highly regulated at several co-operating layers to achieve the eventual activation or repression of the downstream target genes that will steer the cellular response of the stimulated cells. For my PhD research we made use of several perturbation methods (knockouts, knockdowns) followed by omics based analysis in selected cells isolated from mouse models (and embryonic cells thereof) and applied bio-informatics {{to focus on the}} effects on the transcriptome, further connecting (in the embryonic stem cells (ESCs) used in part of these studies) to the DNA-methylome. In addition, we document how effects of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and Activin/Nodal, key members of the TGFb family, together with their signal transduction and downstream components are themselves dynamically integrated in this network, particularly by using ESCs, which are well-suited for such experiments. Furthermore, we extend our research to two in vivo model systems to investigate more complex interactions within a developing embryo. My main focus was on {{the development of a new}} strategy to deconstruct the transcriptional interactions between genes encoding components of prime interest of our signaling pathway and the transcriptional <b>regulators</b> and <b>drivers</b> of a cell differentiation system, i. e. mouse ESCs in neural inducing environment. We have first optimized many aspects of the experimental set-up and then documented and subsequently integrated a transcriptional regulatory network in three dimensions. We started by selecting and prioritizing, based on precise criteria, a small, manageable TGFb family centric network for which we (i) analyzed the temporal kinetics of mRNA levels together with (ii) the systematic documentation of cell-stage specific gene-gene interactions based on esiRNA-mediated perturbations. We then added another layer of refinement (iii) by assessing the transcriptional heterogeneity at the single-cell level. This has provided an unprecedented and more systems level insights for TGFβ signaling thereby also moving beyond the – often binary and linear – understanding of its pathway(s) and target gene expression output. This potentially provides a new starting point to better understand complicated cellular responses and also improve differentiation protocols for various stem cells ex vivo in which this relevant signaling system operates. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a master thesis {{performed}} at MacGREGOR (SWE) AB (Crane Division), Örnsköldsvik. MacGREGOR (SWE) AB (Crane Division) is the world’s leading marine cargo crane supplier with cranes designed for operation in harbor and sheltered water environments. The project aimed to identify and investigate needs and problem areas in the crane cabin with the purpose to design an ergonomic and user-friendly driver environment. Besides ergonomics and user interaction, sturdiness, comfort and safety have been keywords throughout the project. It has not been possible to observe drivers at work because of the world wide location of the cranes. Therefore needs and problem areas were identified through interviews with personnel at MacGREGOR (SWE) AB (Crane Division) and analysis through different methods and softwares such as I- deas, Jack and RULA. The project group has also been given the opportunity to drive a crane and observe the relations between <b>regulators,</b> indicators and <b>driver.</b> To investigate new solutions and designs, competitors and related technologies were thoroughly analyzed. Four concepts were created after the design specification was established. To see how well the concepts fulfilled the identified needs they were evaluated in a merit calculation table. Concept 1 “Rotate all” and concept 4 “Office chair” were then compared in a weak-point analysis. After consultation with the instructors at MacGREGOR (SWE) AB (Crane Division) it was decided that “Rotate all” was to be further developed. The final solution is a combination of new ideas and ideas from the four concepts in the concept design phase. Aspects considering function and form have been carefully thought out using theoretical guidelines in ergonomics, semiotics and gestalts. The new crane cabin emphasizes quality and a feeling for the company through colors, shape and placement. The new crane cabin is based on an adjustable interior suited for drivers between the 5 th and 95 th percentile. A major improvement is the rotating chair with integrated control levers on the armrests. The indicators and regulators are separated and now placed on the walls.

40|$|Thanks {{to modern}} {{high-throughput}} {{technologies such as}} microarray-based gene expression profiling, {{a large amount of}} molecular profile data have been generated in several disease related contexts. Despite the fact that these data likely contain systems-level information about disease regulation, revealing the underlying dynamics between genes and mechanisms of gene regulation in genome wide way remains a major challenge. Understanding these mechanisms in genome-wide fashion and the resulting dynamical behavior is a key goal of the nascent field of systems biology. One approach to dissect the logic of the cell, is to use reverse engineering algorithms that infer regulatory interactions form molecular profile data. In this context, use of information theoretic approaches has been very successful: for instance, the ARACNe algorithm has been able to successfully infer transcriptional interactions between transcription factors and their target genes; similarly, the MINDy algorithm has identified post-translational modulators of transcription factor activity by multivariate analysis of large gene expression profile datasets. Many methods have been proposed to improve ARACNe both from a computational efficiency perspective and in terms of increasing the accuracy of the predicted interactions. Yet, the main core of ARACNe, i. e., the data processing inequality (DPI), has remained virtually unaffected even though modern information theory has extended the DPI theorem into higher-order interactions. First, we introduce an improvement of ARACNe, hARACNe, which recursively applies a higher-order DPI analysis. We show that the new algorithm successfully detects false positive feed-forward loops involving more than three genes. Second, we extend the MINDy algorithm using co-information as a novel metric, thus replacing the conditional mutual information and significantly improving the algorithm’s predictions. Largely, two ultimate goals of systems perturbation studies are to reveal how human diseases are connected with the genes, and to find regulatory mechanism that determine disease cell behavior. However, these goals remain daunting: even the most talented researchers still have to rely on laborious genetic screens and very simplified hypotheses about effects of given perturbation have been experimentally validated and roughly analyzed with very limited regulatory sub-network such as pathway. To overcome these limitations, use of gene regulatory network is explored in this thesis research. Specifically, we propose creation of a new algorithm that can accurately predict cell state in genome-wide fashion following perturbation of individual genes, such as from silencing or ectopic expression experiments. Furthermore, experimentally validated methods to predict genome-wide changes in a cellular system following a genetic perturbation (e. g., gene silencing or ectopic expression) are still unavailable, and even though phenotypic variations are experimentally profiled and gene signatures are selected by being statistically tested, finding the exact regulator which systematically causes significant variations of gene signature is still quite challenging. In this research, I introduce and experimentally validate a probabilistic Bayesian method to simulate the propagation of genetic perturbations on integrated gene regulatory networks inferred by the hARACNe and coMINDy algorithms from human B cell data. With the same predictive framework, we also computationally predict the master <b>driver</b> (<b>regulator)</b> that is most likely to have produced the observed variations in gene expression levels; these studies as a systematized pre-screening process before genetic manipulation. I predict in silico the effect of silencing of several genes as well as the cause of phenotypic variations. Performance analysis, tested by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), shows that the new methods are highly predictive, thus providing an initial step toward building predictive probabilistic regulatory models, which may be applicable as pre-screening steps in perturbation studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of gardens as the structuring element {{in shaping the}} Iranian indigenous cities had {{an important role in}} the territorial organization. They shaped the interrelation between infrastructural networks, settlements and agricultural tissue and made the relationship between the culture and nature possible. Indigenous landscape organization in the semi-arid climate of the Iranian plateau shows the necessary role of energy management at different scales of urbanization. In the past, gardens as complex landscape entities, were identified as sustainable energy systems. (Behbahani, 2011) They were associated with trans-cultural tradition and landscape mechanisms, combining energy drivers and the spatial development in the cities. Energy drivers are the essential forces and motions in different layers of a territory which influence changes in stable spatial developments. (Jakob, 2001) However, due to fast urban growth and the introduction of new drivers into the territory, the new urbanization model forgot the indigenous practices, and caused an over-utilization of land and resources. It is a landscape of transportation, accumulation, production and construction where successive energy drivers are making the cities, regions and urbanized locations. (Ghosn, 2009) Today this model faces a challenging problem of scarcity (mainly water) and therefore, integrating the energy flows into the study of the Iranian territory is essential to understanding future development. In order to study this issue, the paper focuses on the dispersed city territory consisting of a network of New Towns around the city of Isfahan, which was also the cultural and economic capital of Safavid dynasty during the 17 th and 18 th century. The radical change in the territory is largely the result of a newly industrialized region with different energy consumption centers (as oil refinery and steel Mill Company). In the evolution of Persian garden history, Isfahan is the first post-medieval example where the city is open towards landscape without any fortification (Faghih, 2012), and in which the geographical condition was tamed by involving drivers such as the river, canals and vernacular underground water structure called Qanat. The garden worked as a starting point for spatial configuration which also formed the basis for resource management for the city. (Khosravi, 2014) Access to water was the necessary and sufficient condition for the garden as driver of development, therefore the existence of Zayandeh River (life giving river) as the biggest river in the Iran’s central plateau, was an important element in construction of Isfahan city. In addition, technically advanced water management structures were designed in order to direct the city’s development and productivity by integrating it into the larger regional systems. This article targets the shift in perspective of Isfahan’s New Town developments through the lens of the Garden as a <b>regulator</b> of energy <b>drivers.</b> The New Towns’ original plans show a dominance of the garden form in the conception of the plan while a closer look at the actual construction shows that the gardens no longer follow the structure of the traditional Iranian system but merely serve as ornaments to the city. The existence of the garden no longer targets resource management at any scale of development. From garden to greenery and beautiful scenery to residual cores on one hand, and the water management and city growth on the other hand do not follow the Chaharbagh’s (traditional Persian system) managing principles. In this reading the garden concept is a multi-scalar component which unravels the inconsistency in the interrelation between the nexus of energy drivers from the scale of one New Town neighborhood to the dispersed territorial scale of Isfahan. Recognition of the problematic processes will be a starting point for projecting new sustainable agendas for the on-going and future development of New Towns and the larger region. In the first part, the paper studies the value of indigenous landscape management in the Isfahan region. This is valued beyond its celebratory character, emphasizing the infrastructural significance. Furthermore, the reading helps to re-work this indigenous landscape management projectively. The article targets this gap in reading Isfahan’s recent growth in order to highlight the shift in the role of the garden in New Town development and investigates the relationship between resources and new settlements. The second part the paper selects three New Towns and analyses them in comparison with Isfahan city. To approach the issue descriptively, the principles of landscape urbanism based on interpretive cartography have been selected as a methodology. The landscape characteristics and the accessibility to energy drivers are different in each case of study, therefore mapping is a way to observe and unfold these complexities. Historical maps and archival documents support the projective mapping of the cases from the regional scale into the meso scale of the New Town to the neighborhood scale, unraveling the relationship between garden and the city. status: publishe...|$|R
