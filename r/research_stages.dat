Christine Geraghty, then senior lecturer in film and TV at Goldsmith's College, countered that the factual accuracy of the storyline depended on how the producers wanted to portray the issue to viewers.

40|$|Sustainable {{construction}} projects affect various stakeholders with different social, {{environmental and economic}} interests. It is essential that the decision makers maintain effective communication with relevant groups to avoid project failures. Although citizen participation offers a means of better addressing and meeting stakeholder concerns and expectations, the decision/evaluations of contemporary sustainable projects are becoming ever more complicated, with {{an increasing number of}} stakeholders involved to actively defend their own interests. In response, this paper provides a thorough and comprehensive analysis of the stakeholders of sustainable construction in China and quantifies their influence in decision/evaluations by semi-structured interviews (in <b>research</b> <b>stage</b> I) and a three-round Delphi survey (in <b>research</b> <b>stage</b> II). Follow-up interviews (in <b>research</b> <b>stage</b> III) are carried out to collect more in-depth views concerning the characteristics and the respective importance of each stakeholder group involved. The findings indicate that the government is the most influential entity {{and the extent to which}} its intervention is needed in balancing the interests of other stakeholders presents a major challenge. The high potential influence of end-users is also identified, suggesting the need for a more transparent and inclusive participatory decision/evaluation process in the country. An enhanced future role for NGOs is further identified...|$|R

With the objective of equaling the acceleration of competitorsâ flagship sport bikes, Honda increased the stroke of its inline 4-cylinder 750cc engine and thus raised displacement to 893cc. Complementing its power performance were the bikeâs dry weight of just 185 kg, wheelbase of 1,405 mm and a body almost identical to that of the advanced <b>research</b> <b>stage</b> model. At 453 lb wet weight, it was by just 4 lb heavier than the CBR600F2, while the next-lightest open-class machine Yamaha FZR1000 was heavier by 76 lb.|$|R

40|$|As a {{response}} to the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Indonesia intensively pursued corporate governance reforms. However, the reforms were found to be unsatisfactory; some factors, such as specific business characteristics, were considered as contributing to the ineffectiveness of the reforms. Therefore, Indonesia provides an interesting setting to examine the effectiveness of the implementation of the Anglo-American corporate governance model in an emerging economy context. This study focuses on one Anglo-American corporate governance mechanism that has been actively promoted in Indonesia, namely, the audit committee. The objectives of the study are three-fold: (1) To examine the association between public listed companies with specific business characteristics (namely family control, politically connected independent commissioners, and foreign institutional investors) and their level of compliance with audit committee rules; (2) To examine whether the compliance, which also indicates the level of audit committee effectiveness, is associated with restatements of financial statements, and; (3) To examine the influence of family control on the association between audit committee effectiveness and restatements of financial statements. This study is divided into two interrelated research stages: a study on the determinants of compliance of public listed companies with audit committee rules (<b>Research</b> <b>Stage</b> 1), and a study on the association between audit committee effectiveness and restatements (<b>Research</b> <b>Stage</b> 2). <b>Research</b> <b>Stage</b> 1 employs short balanced panel data that, in total, cover 828 company-year observations for the period 2006 - 2008. The method of analysis used is feasible generalised least squares (FGLS), as the presence of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation are noted in the data. Meanwhile, <b>Research</b> <b>Stage</b> 2 utilises cross sectional data, namely, 158 restating companies for the period 2006 - 2012 matched with 158 control companies for the same period. The method of analysis is matched pair logistic regression. The results of <b>Research</b> <b>Stage</b> 1 indicate that different types of family control have different effects on the level of compliance of public listed companies with audit committee rules. Family-controlled companies with family members on boards are less likely to comply with audit committee rules. In contrast, companies controlled through family shareholding but without family involvement in their daily business activities are more likely to comply with audit committee rules. Additionally, public listed companies with politically connected independent commissioners are less likely to comply with audit committee rules. As expected, public listed companies with large, genuine foreign institutional investors are more likely to comply with audit committee rules. Meanwhile, the results of <b>Research</b> <b>Stage</b> 2 reveal that audit committee effectiveness is not significantly associated with restatements of financial statements. This implies that the presence of an audit committee might be just cosmetic or symbolic. However, the use of restatements of financial statements as a proxy for financial reporting quality might contribute to the insignificance of audit committee effectiveness because this proxy might not be appropriate in the Indonesian environment...|$|R
