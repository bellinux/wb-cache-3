5|$|Joseph's role in {{the show}} is that of troubled surgeon – the {{resultant}} angst of his brother's attempted suicide and his own anally <b>retentive</b> personality lead to the revelation the character suffers from Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). His major storylines included an accidental drugs overdose, and a relationship with fellow surgical registrar Jac Naylor, who cheated on him with his own father. Roberts' performance resulted in a longlist nomination for the Most Popular Newcomer award at the 2006 National Television Awards.|$|E

25|$|Generally {{speaking}} partial dentures {{tend to be}} held {{in place}} by the presence of the remaining natural teeth and complete dentures tend to rely on muscular co-ordination and suction to stay in place. The maxilla very commonly has more favorable denture bearing anatomy as the ridge tends to be well formed and there is a larger area on the palate for suction to retain the denture. Conversely, the mandible tends to make lower dentures less <b>retentive</b> due to the displacing presence of the tongue and the higher rate of resorption, frequently leading to significantly resorbed lower ridges. Disto-lingual regions tend to offer retention even in highly resorbed mandibles, and extension of the flange into these regions tends to produce a more <b>retentive</b> lower denture. An implant supported lower denture is another option.|$|E

He was also interested in flying, sailing, and fishing. According to A Biography, Burr was an avid reader with a <b>retentive</b> memory. He was also among the earliest importers and breeders of Portuguese Water Dogs in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Balakirev, who {{had never}} had any {{systematic}} course in harmony and counterpoint and had not even superficially applied himself to them, evidently thought such studies quite unnecessary.... An excellent pianist, a superior sight reader of music, a splendid improviser, endowed by nature {{with a sense of}} correct harmony and part-writing, he possessed a technique partly native and partly acquired through a vast musical erudition, {{with the help of an}} extraordinary memory, keen and <b>retentive,</b> which means so much in steering a critical course in musical literature. Then, too, he was a marvelous critic, especially a technical critic. He instantly felt every technical imperfection or error, he grasped a defect in form at once.|$|E
25|$|Judah possessed {{such great}} zeal for {{learning}} and such tireless energy that he even omitted daily prayer {{in order to secure}} more time for study, and prayed but once in thirty days (R. H. 35a). This diligence, together with a remarkably <b>retentive</b> memory, made it possible for him to collect and transmit the greater part of Rav's, as well as many of Samuel's, sayings; the Talmud contains about four hundred haggadic and halakic sayings by the former, and many by the latter, all recorded by Judah b. Ezekiel, while a number of other sayings of Rav's that occur in the Talmud without the name of the transmitter likewise were handed down by Judah (Rashi to Ḥul. 44a).|$|E
25|$|Sheshet lived {{first at}} Nehardea, where {{he used to}} study in the synagogue Shaf we-Yatib (Meg. 29a), going thence to Maḥuza (Ned. 78a, b; B. B. 121a), and later to Shilhe, where he founded an academy (Letter of Sherira Gaon, in Neubauer, M. J. C. i. 29). He was feeble in body (Pes. 108a), but had, nevertheless, an iron will and great energy (Men. 95b), and {{although}} he was blind he was compensated by a very <b>retentive</b> memory, for he knew by heart the entire body of tannaitic tradition, as well as its amoraic interpretations (Shebu. 41b). He hired a scholar ("tanna") acquainted with the Mishnah and the Baraita to read them to him (Sanh. 86a; Hor. 9a).|$|E
25|$|Retention is the {{principle}} that describes how well the denture is prevented from moving vertically {{in the opposite direction}} of insertion. The better the topographical mimicry of the intaglio (interior) surface of the denture base {{to the surface of the}} underlying mucosa, the better the retention will be (in removable partial dentures, the clasps are a major provider of retention), as surface tension, suction and friction will aid in keeping the denture base from breaking intimate contact with the mucosal surface. It is important to note that the most critical element in the <b>retentive</b> design of a maxillary complete denture is a complete and total border seal (complete peripheral seal) in order to achieve 'suction'. The border seal is composed of the edges of the anterior and lateral aspects and the posterior palatal seal. The posterior palatal seal design is accomplished by covering the entire hard palate and extending not beyond the soft palate and ending 1–2mm from the vibrating line.|$|E

500|$|After {{appearing}} in the 1986 films Jumpin' Jack Flash and ¡Three Amigos!, Hartman successfully auditioned for NBC's variety show Saturday Night Live (SNL) and joined the cast and writing staff. He told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "I wanted to do [...] because I {{wanted to get the}} exposure that would give me box-office credibility so I can write movies for myself." [...] In his eight seasons with the show Hartman became known for his impressions, and performed as over 70 different characters. Hartman's original Saturday Night Live characters included Eugene, the Anal <b>Retentive</b> Chef and Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer. His impressions included Frank Sinatra, Ronald Reagan, Ed McMahon, Barbara Bush, Charlton Heston, Phil Donahue and Bill Clinton; the last was often considered his best-known impression.|$|E
500|$|To {{establish}} {{the authenticity of}} a particular Hadith or report, {{it had to be}} checked by following the chain of transmission (isnad). Thus the reporters had to cite their reference, and their reference's reference {{all the way back to}} Muhammad. All the references in the chain had to have a reputation for honesty and possessing a good <b>retentive</b> memory. [...] Thus biographical analysis (`ilm al-rijāl, lit. [...] "science of people"), which contains details about the transmitter are scrutinized. This includes analyzing their date and place of birth; familial connections; teachers and students; religiosity; moral behaviour; literary output; their travels; as well as their date of death. Based upon these criteria, the reliability (thiqāt) of the transmitter is assessed. Also determined is whether the individual was actually able to transmit the report, which is deduced from their contemporaneity and geographical proximity with the other transmitters in the chain. Examples of biographical dictionaries include Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani's [...] "Tahdhīb al-Tahdhīb" [...] or al-Dhahabi's [...] "Tadhkirat al-huffāz." ...|$|E

2500|$|Implant {{technology}} can vastly improve the patient's denture-wearing experience by increasing stability and preventing bone from wearing away. [...] Implants can also aid retention. [...] Instead of merely placing the implants {{to serve as}} blocking mechanism against the denture's pushing on the alveolar bone, small <b>retentive</b> appliances can {{be attached to the}} implants that can then snap into a modified denture base to allow for tremendously increased retention. [...] Available options include a metal [...] "Hader bar" [...] or precision balls attachments.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a classic}} case {{one of the best}} design for a post to {{decrease}} the risk of failure is the narrowest & longest smooth, parallel post that one can fit into the post space. [...] Utilizing the longest possible post ensures that the forces transmitted from the crown are distributed over as much of the root as possible. [...] Using the appropriate diameter post ensures that as much natural tooth structure as possible is left to support the post and absorb the transmitted forces. [...] A parallel post ensures the greatest retention of the post within the canal, and is perhaps utilized with only the slightest loss of tooth structure to the internal wall of the canal. [...] A smooth-surfaced post, although less <b>retentive</b> than either serrated or threaded post surfaces, transmits the least amount of force to the root structure. [...] While both smooth and serrated posts are passive, in that they simply lie within the post space after being cemented, threaded posts actively engage the internal walls of the root canal as they are screwed in, and, while being the most <b>retentive</b> by far, produce such a force on the brittle root structure that they are contraindicated in most situations.|$|E

Why isn't it Richard Nixon or Paul McCartney?" [...] Similar angst came from Sonic Youth in their song [...] "Kill Yr Idols" [...] (at the time known as [...] "I Killed Christgau with My Big Fucking Dick"), in which they sing [...] "I don't know why / You wanna impress Christgau / Ah let that shit die / And find out the new goal"; Christgau responded by saying [...] "Idolization is for rock stars, even rock stars manqué like these impotent bohos—critics just want a little respect.
