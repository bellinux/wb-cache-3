40|$|AbstractThis {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in 2006 - 2010 to study the specifics of personal self-esteem during intercultural adaptation of the <b>repatriates</b> in the educational environment of high school. The subject of inquiry was the <b>repatriated</b> students from China and Mongolia. Sample volume – 106 people. The survey used a range of psychological methods and techniques: content analysis of documents, questioning, peer reviews (scaling), and specific psychodiagnostic techniques - incomplete sentences, sociometry, Budassi test, questionnaire on adaptation of individual to the new social and cultural environment (L. V. Yankovsky), and various statistical treatment methods. It was revealed that: 1) Self-esteem {{is one of the}} socio-psychological factors of successful intercultural adaptation of <b>repatriated</b> students in the educational environment of high school. 2) The dynamics of changing of self-esteem of the <b>repatriates</b> at different stages of learning depend on its initial level; people with high self-esteem experience less fluctuations of self-esteem than people with the average level of self-esteem. 3) Creation of a system of social and psychological support of the <b>repatriates</b> enhances the effectiveness of intercultural adaptation of <b>repatriated</b> students in high schools...|$|R

5|$|Just {{before the}} end of {{hostilities}} in the Pacific, the recently established garrison headquarters No.11 Group unofficially directed the wing's operations. Following the Japanese surrender in September 1945, No.82 Wing's Liberators were converted to transports and used to <b>repatriate</b> RAAF personnel from the South West Pacific. Over the course of its wartime existence, the wing's personnel numbered between 3,000 and 5,000, of whom more than half were ground crew. Along with its flying squadrons, its complement included No.24 Air Stores Park, No.6 Repair and Servicing Unit, and No.30 Medical Clearing Station.|$|E
5|$|With the {{republic}} suffering heavy losses after the war, Stalin allowed an open immigration policy in Armenia; the diaspora {{were invited to}} <b>repatriate</b> to Armenia (nergaght) and revitalize the country's population and bolster its workforce.

They were offered the option of having their expenses paid by the Soviet government for their trip back to their homeland. An estimated 150,000Armenians immigrated to Soviet Armenia between 1946 and 1948 and settled in Yerevan, Leninakan, Kirovakan and other towns.|$|E
5|$|Allied forces sent {{to disarm}} the Japanese and <b>repatriate</b> {{prisoners of war}} arrived in Indonesia in September 1945.

Allied forces began landing in the city on 20October 1945; a small group was sent to Gedangan to speak with Soegijapranata. Concerned with civilian suffering, the vicar apostolic told the Allies that they must stop the battle; the Allies could not comply as they did not know the Japanese commander. Soegijapranata then contacted the Japanese and, that afternoon, brokered a cease-fire agreement in his office at Gedangan, despite Indonesian forces' firing at the Gurkha soldiers posted in front of the building.|$|E

After the Pacific War ended in August 1945, the Seventh Fleet assisted in landing troops in Korea and northern China to occupy these areas and <b>repatriate</b> Allied prisoners of war. Kinkaid elected not to land troops at Chefoo as originally instructed because the city was {{in the hands of}} the Communist Eighth Route Army; Tsingtao was substituted instead. He was awarded the Legion of Merit by the theater commander in China, Lieutenant General Albert C. Wedemeyer, and the Grand Cordon of the Order of Precious Tripod by the Chinese government.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of push and pull factors on career aspirations of Malaysian <b>repatriates.</b> Design/methodology/approach: The Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) {{was used as the}} study's underlying theory. Data were gathered from 129 self-initiated <b>repatriates</b> and analysed using multiple regression analysis. Findings: The analysis shows that political variables of push factors, as well as personal and family variables of pull factors, predicted repatriates' career aspirations. The independent variables explained 31. 2 % variance of repatriates' career aspiration model. Research limitations/implications: The research was limited to <b>repatriates</b> employed in organizations within the Klang Valley region, namely Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya and Petaling Jaya. Practical implications: The paper offers practical implications for human resource managers, general managers, and employees by using the links between the predictive factors and career aspirations of <b>repatriates</b> to further strategize human resource development strategies. The findings could help government bodies to narrow their focus on repatriates' needs so that the loss of talents due to brain drain would be repaid upon their return. As a result, <b>repatriates</b> will also be able to contribute their skills, expertise, knowledge and experiences that they have gained abroad to the homeland. Originality/value: This study is a step forward in understanding {{the influence of}} social, personal, family, economic and political factors on the career aspirations of <b>repatriates.</b> The study, {{the first of its kind}} in this country, provides an insight to human resource practitioners in dealing with the career aspirations of <b>repatriates...</b>|$|R
5|$|Houphouët-Boigny {{adopted a}} system of {{economic}} liberalism in Côte d'Ivoire {{in order to obtain}} the trust and confidence of foreign investors, most notably the French. The advantages granted by the investment laws he established in 1959 allowed foreign business to <b>repatriate</b> up to 90% of their profits in their country of origin (the remaining 10% was reinvested in Côte d'Ivoire). He also developed an agenda for modernising the country's infrastructure, for example, building an American-style business district in Abidjan where five-star hotels and resorts welcomed tourists and businessmen. Côte d'Ivoire experienced economic growth of 11–12% from 1960 to 1965. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) grew twelvefold between 1960 and 1978, from 145 to 1,750billion CFA francs, while the trade balance continued to record a surplus.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to <b>repatriate</b> Koga's body, American author Jim Rearden led a search on Akutan in 1988. He located Koga's grave, but found it empty. Rearden and Japanese {{businessman}} Minoru Kawamoto conducted a records search. They found that in 1947 Koga's body was exhumed by an American Graves Registration Service team and re-buried on Adak Island, further down the Aleutian chain. The team, unaware of Koga's identity, marked his body as unidentified. The Adak cemetery was excavated in 1953, and 236 bodies were returned to Japan. The body buried next to Koga (Shigeyoshi Shindo) was one of 13 identified; the remaining 223 unidentified remains were re-interred in Chidorigafuchi National Cemetery in Japan. It is probable that Koga was one of them. Rearden later wrote the definitive account of the Akutan Zero.|$|E
5|$|Initially, it was rumoured that, {{following}} the armistice, all French {{troops would be}} soon returned by the Germans. From the autumn of 1940, the Germans began to <b>repatriate</b> French reservists whose private occupations were in short supply in Vichy France, such as medical workers like doctors and nurses along with postmen and gendarmes. In 1941, after lobbying by the Vichy government, the policy was extended to French veterans of World War I and fathers of four or more children. Individual prisoners with good contacts could also be requested for repatriation. In practice, this meant that {{a disproportionate number of}} prisoners who were released early came from the upper classes.|$|E
