Saba and Anguilla were affected the most, with total damage amounting to $623,500(1955USD). There was an earlier hurricane named Alice in the season. Operationally, lack of definitive data prevented the U.S. Weather Bureau from declaring the system a hurricane until January 2.

5|$|Routine {{observations}} {{were taken by}} the team on October 21, 2003, using the 1.2m Samuel Oschin Schmidt telescope at Palomar Observatory, California, but the image of Eris was not discovered at that point due to its very slow motion across the sky: The team's automatic image-searching software excluded all objects moving at less than 1.5arcseconds per hour {{to reduce the number}} of false positives returned. When Sedna was discovered, it was moving at 1.75arcsec/h, and in light of that the team reanalyzed their old data with a lower limit on the angular motion, sorting through the previously excluded images by eye. In January 2005, the <b>re-analysis</b> revealed Eris's slow motion against the background stars.|$|E
5|$|The 1868 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was among the}} quietest on record, with only four tropical cyclones recorded. Only three seasons had fewer storms than in 1868, and seven had {{the same number of}} storms. Initially, there were no known storms during the season, although a <b>re-analysis</b> confirmed the activity. All tropical activity occurred within a 45‑day span. There may have been other unconfirmed tropical cyclones during the season. Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimates up to six storms were missed from the official database, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively unpopulated coastlines.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{considered}} dissipated, a <b>re-analysis</b> of satellite imagery indicated {{the circulation of}} Olaf persisted as turned to the west toward open waters. Early on September 30, the system reached the Pacific, and it continued westward for about a week, during which it retained some convective activity. On October 5, Olaf turned toward the east, as it interacted with the large circulation of developing Hurricane Pauline. Later that day, the NHC resumed issuing advisories, while it was located about 560 miles (900km) southwest of {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California Peninsula. The system turned to the southeast, and, failing to organize, the NHC discontinued advisories on October 8. Three days later, after the remnants of Olaf turned toward the north, the NHC again resumed advisories, when it was just 70 miles (115km) south-southwest of Tecomán, Colima. Late on October 12, the circulation of Olaf made its final landfall near Manzanillo, Colima, and it quickly dissipated. An associated area of thunderstorms moved over open waters again, but failed to redevelop.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Twelve formed {{over the}} southeastern Bahamas at 5:00p.m. EDT (2100 UTC) on August 23, 2005, {{partially}} from {{the remains of}} Tropical Depression Ten, which had dissipated due {{to the effects of}} a nearby upper tropospheric trough. While the normal standards for numbering tropical depressions in the Atlantic indicate that the old name/number is retained when a depression dissipates and regenerates, satellite data indicated that a second tropical wave combined with Tropical Depression Ten north of Puerto Rico to form a new, much more advanced system, which was then designated as Tropical Depression Twelve. Simultaneously, the trough in the upper troposphere weakened, causing the wind shear in the area to relax, thereby allowing the new tropical depression to develop. In a later <b>re-analysis,</b> it was determined that the low-level circulation of Ten had completely detached and dissipated, with only the remnant mid-level circulation moving on and merging with the aforementioned second tropical wave. As a result, the criteria for keeping the same name and identity were not met.|$|E
5|$|During April 1, RSMC Nadi {{reported}} that Tropical Disturbance 14F, had developed along an active monsoon trough {{to the north}} of Fiji. During the next day the disturbance gradually developed into a tropical depression, as it moved eastwards and interacted with a shallow tropical disturbance that was located to the east of 14F. The disturbance was subsequently absorbed by 14F’s circulation early on April 3, while the system was located between Tonga and Fiji. Overall organization at this time was still poor with convection struggling to consolidate under shear and diurnal influences. Overnight of the 3rd, though, convection erupted over the centre with the primary band to the east wrapping tightly around the centre. On <b>re-analysis,</b> TD14F attained cyclone status around 031800 UTC while located to the north-northwest of Nukualofa and gradually accelerating towards the southeast. Through April 4, the cyclone moved into minimal shear with good outflow channels aloft. 12 hours later, at 040600 UTC, Lin was upgraded to a storm with 50 knots close to the centre. The cyclone intensified further under favourable conditions and reached a peak intensity of 60 knots while located about 15 nautical miles south-southeast of Nukualofa. As it left Tonga, interaction with drier air and shear increased. This was aided by an approaching upper-trough from the west. At 051800 UTC, intensity was reduced to 45 knots with further weakening anticipated due to stronger shear and cooler waters. Wellington took over warnings for the cyclone from 060000 UTC and downgraded Lin to an extra-tropical system in their first warning. TCWC Wellington subsequently continued to monitor the system until it was last noted on April 8.|$|E

25|$|The JAACAP {{article on}} study 329 was never retracted. The journal's editors say the {{negative}} findings {{are included in}} a table, and that therefore there are no grounds to withdraw the article. In September 2015 the BMJ published a <b>re-analysis</b> of the study.

25|$|The {{research}} conducted for CBT {{has been a}} topic of sustained controversy.

For example, one study determined CBT to be superior to other treatments in treating anxiety and depression. However, researchers responding directly to that study conducted a <b>re-analysis</b> and found no evidence of CBT being superior to other bona fide treatments, and conducted an analysis of thirteen other CBT clinical trials and determined that they failed to provide evidence of CBT superiority.|$|E
25|$|The {{possibility}} of sterile neutrinos—relatively light neutrinos {{which do not}} participate in the weak interaction but which could be created through flavor oscillation (see below)—is unaffected by these Z-boson-based measurements, and the existence of such particles is in fact hinted by experimental data from the LSND experiment. However, the currently running MiniBooNE experiment suggested, until recently, that sterile neutrinos are not required to explain the experimental data, although the latest research into this area is on-going and anomalies in the MiniBooNE data may allow for exotic neutrino types, including sterile neutrinos. A recent <b>re-analysis</b> of reference electron spectra data from the Institut Laue-Langevin has also hinted at a fourth, sterile neutrino.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, {{researchers}} from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology succeeded in extracting DNA from two fossil hominin fragments from Okladnikov Cave: the humeral diaphysis of a juvenile and a separate femur fragment. mtDNA sequencing confirmed that both fragments most likely belonged the same individual, dubbed Okladnikov 2. The mtDNA sequences of the HVR I (hypervariable region I) from Okladnikov 2 confirmed that the individual was Neanderthal. On the basis of mtDNA analysis, Okladnikov 2 {{was found to be}} more related to European and western Asian Neanderthals. A 2014 <b>re-analysis</b> teasing out ancient DNA from contaminated sequences allowed researchers to complete the mtDNA sequence from Okladnikov 2. The completed sequence shows that the Okladnikov 2 mtDNA is basal to that sequenced from Mezmaiskaya 1 from Mezmaiskaya Cave and is even closer to western Neanderthals than previously thought.|$|E
25|$|The name Paluxysaurus {{was based}} on the {{specimen}} FWMSH 93B-10-18, a partial skull including an associated left maxilla, nasal, and teeth. Other bones from the quarry included a partial neck of seven vertebrae, thirteen vertebrae from the back and 30 from the tail, and examples of all limb and girdle bones except some hand and foot bones. It was distinguished from all other sauropods by vertebral details, and has various morphological differences in other bones compared to other sauropods of the Early Cretaceous of North America. The genus was limited to the bonebed remains; for example, the partial skeleton from Wise County known as Pleurocoelus sp. (SMU 61732) is not referred to Paluxysaurus; instead that specimen is the holotype of Astrophocaudia slaughteri D'Emic 2012, another somphospondylan sauropod. There are differences in the remains of P. sp. and Paluxysaurus, but they cannot be distinguished with confidence. In 2012, <b>re-analysis</b> of these specimens in light of additional Sauroposeidon remains led paleontologists D'Emic and Foreman to conclude that Paluxysaurus was the same animal as Sauroposeidon, and thus a junior synonym of S. proteles.|$|E
25|$|Opinions have {{differed}} as to {{the precise}} mechanism by which water had built up in such quantity and then had suddenly been released with such devastating consequences. For many years the accepted explanation was that proposed by Joseph Vallot. It was believed that meltwater had drained through the glacier and become trapped as an intraglacial cavity, i.e. as an underground lake within a crevasse which itself had then become enlarged and widened by the water. However, recent <b>re-analysis</b> of historic photographs, accounts and contemporary meteorological precipitation data and field measurements, including radar analysis and magnetic resonance imaging, has presented an alternative and more plausible mechanism in which meltwater collected {{much closer to the}} surface (as a supraglacial lake) in a period when the glacier had a negative mass balance (i.e. was experiencing year-on-year melting and retreat). Prior to 1878 the glacier would not have been well-visited, so any surface lake could have gone unnoticed, and after 1878 the glacier experienced a positive mass balance (i.e. year-on-year accumulation of snow and ice) which would have hidden the lake from view until the eventual outburst flood in 1892.|$|E
25|$|In May 2011, an {{analysis}} of eastern wolf, red wolf, gray wolf, and dog genomes suggested that the wolves of Algonquin Provincial Park are 58% gray wolf and 42% coyote, suggesting that the eastern wolf is a coywolf with more gray wolf content than the red wolf. This study analyzed 48,000SNP and found no evidence for a unique eastern wolf species. In 2012, <b>re-analysis</b> of the 2011 SNP study argued that the original SNP study suffered from insufficient sampling and noted that gray wolves do not mate with coyotes. Another Y-chromosome genetic study in 2012 also argued that the eastern wolf and red wolf are not hybrids but rather are a distinct species from the gray wolf, although eastern and red wolves do intermix with coyotes. The same authors {{have argued that the}} 2011 SNP study finding that eastern wolves are not an independent species is flawed and that historical hunting and culling of wolves, leading to invasion of coyotes into eastern North America, has led to introgression of coyote mitochondrial and nuclear DNA into fragmented, decimated eastern wolf packs. They and other authors have postulated that large populations of eastern and red wolves with intact social/pack structures are less likely to interbreed with coyotes. The controversy over the eastern wolf's species status {{was the subject of a}} comprehensive review of the 2011 and 2012 genetics studies, which concluded that there are four separate species of Canis in North America, the eastern wolf, red wolf, gray wolf and coyote.|$|E

500|$|Early on November13, the {{hurricane}} further intensified to {{the equivalent of}} a Category2 system and attained peak winds of 105mph (165km/h). No barometric pressure was recorded at the time of peak intensity since it occurred over water and away from any ships. In an initial analysis of the storm made by meteorologist José Fernández Partagás in 1999, he wrote that at the storm's peak, it was a strong tropical storm, not a hurricane. In a report, it was stated that [...] "It was a difficult case for the author [...] {{to decide whether or not}} to upgrade to a hurricane". It was not until the Atlantic hurricane database <b>re-analysis</b> reached 1909 in February 2004 that the storm was designated as a hurricane. By November14, the storm began to weaken as it turned nearly due east. Later that day, it quickly transitioned into an extratropical cyclone before being absorbed by a frontal system northeast of the Lesser Antilles.|$|E

500|$|Modeling of Io's {{interior}} composition {{suggests that}} the mantle is composed of at least 75% of the magnesium-rich mineral forsterite, and has a bulk composition {{similar to that of}} L-chondrite and LL-chondrite meteorites, with higher iron content (compared to silicon) than the Moon or Earth, but lower than Mars. To support the heat flow observed on Io, 10–20% of Io's mantle may be molten, though regions where high-temperature volcanism has been observed may have higher melt fractions. However, <b>re-analysis</b> of Galileo magnetometer data in 2009 revealed the presence of an induced magnetic field at Io, requiring a magma ocean [...] below the surface.

It is not known if the 10–20% partial melting percentage for Io's mantle is consistent with the requirement for a significant amount of molten silicates in this possible magma ocean.

500|$|The 1950 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the first}} year in the Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT) that storms were given names in the Atlantic basin.

Six of these hurricanes were intense enough to be classified as major hurricanesa denomination reserved for storms that attained sustained winds equivalent to a Category 3 or greater on the present-day Saffir–Simpson scale. One storm, the twelfth of the season, was unnamed and was originally excluded from the yearly summary, and three additional storms were discovered in <b>re-analysis.</b> The large quantity of strong storms during the year yielded, prior to modern reanalysis, what was the highest seasonal accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) of the 20th century in the Atlantic basin; 1950 held the seasonal ACE record until broken by the 2005 Atlantic {{hurricane season}}.

Evidence suggests that the planet was once significantly more habitable than it is today, but whether living organisms ever existed there remains unknown.
