40|$|Extension of 3 -D {{atmospheric}} data products {{back into}} the past is desirable {{for a wide range}} of applications. Historical upper-air data are important in this endeavour, particularly in the maritime regions of the tropics and the southern hemisphere, where observations are extremely sparse. Here we present newly digitized and re-evaluated early ship-based upper-air data from two cruises: (1) kite and <b>registering</b> <b>balloon</b> profiles from onboard the ship SMS Planet on a cruise from Europe around South Africa and across the Indian Ocean to the western Pacific in 1906 / 1907, and (2) ship-based radiosonde data from onboard the MS Schwabenland on a cruise from Europe across the Atlantic to Antarctica and back in 1938 / 1939. We describe the data and provide estimations of the errors. We compare the data with a recent reanalysis (the Twentieth Century Reanalysis Project, 20 CR, Compo et al., 2010) that provides global 3 -D data back to the 19 th century based on an assimilation of surface pressure data only (plus monthly mean sea-surface temperatures). In cruise (1), the agreement is generally good, but large temperature differences appear during a period with a strong inversion. In cruise (2), after a correction to a subset of data, a good agreement between observations and 20 CR is found for geopotential height (GPH) and temperature except for a likely cold bias of 20 CR at the tropopause level. Results are considerably worse for relative humidity, which was reportedly inaccurately measured. Note that comparing 20 CR, which has limited skill in the tropical regions, with measurements form ships in remote regions made under sometimes difficult conditions can be considered a worst case assessment. In view of that fact, the anomaly correlations for temperature of 0. 3 – 0. 6 in the lower troposphere in cruise (1) and of 0. 5 – 0. 7 for tropospheric temperature and GPH in cruise (2) are considered as promising results. Moreover, they are consistent with the error estimations. However, more work is needed for further improving data products in remote regions...|$|E
50|$|By 2003, {{the festival}} {{had grown to}} 100 <b>registered</b> <b>balloons,</b> with more than $40,000 in prizes awarded. There was also six hours of live TV coverage, and more than 120,000 people {{attended}} the event over three days. Portions of the parking fees benefited the Crusade for Children, and additional funds were raised for the Louisville Zoo and several other local non-profit groups.|$|R
50|$|By 2002, {{the event}} {{had grown to}} 85 <b>registered</b> <b>balloons,</b> and WHAS-TV 11, a local {{television}} station in Louisville, featured the evening Balloon Glow during its prime time broadcast. Meijers sponsored the Starship Concert, and Dean's Milk sponsored the balloon races with more than $27,500 in prize money. Pilots travelled from as far as away as New Zealand, Canada and the Western U.S.; they raised more than $35,000 for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, the Louisville Zoo, and the Crusade for Children.|$|R
5000|$|The Balloon Fiesta grew {{each year}} for decades, and today is the largest balloon {{convention}} in the world. The number of <b>registered</b> <b>balloons</b> reached a peak of 1,019 in 2000, prompting the Balloon Fiesta Board {{to limit the number}} to 750 starting in 2001, citing a desire for [...] "quality over quantity". The limit was changed to 600 in 2009 [...] - [...] citing recent growth in the city and a loss of landing zones. On any given day during the festival, up to 100,000 spectators may be on the launch field where they are provided the rare opportunity to observe inflation and take off procedures. Countless more people gather at landing sites all over the city to watch incoming balloons.|$|R
40|$|To better {{understand}} variability in weather and climate, {{it is vital}} to address past atmospheric circulation. This need requires meteorological information not just from the surface but also at upper levels. Current global upper-level datasets only reach back to the 1940 s or 1950 s and do not cover some important periods {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century. Extending the observational record is therefore considered important in order to analyze climate variability in the past and verify global climate models used to predict future climate change. Although earlier upper-air data from platforms such as radio-sondes, aircraft, pilot <b>balloons,</b> <b>registering</b> <b>balloons,</b> and kites are available from various sources, no systematic compilation and quality assessment of upper-level data prior to the International Geophysical Year (1957 / 58) has ever been performed. Here we present the Comprehensive Historical Upper-Air Network (CHUAN). It is a consistent global historical upper-air dataset that has been derived from heterogeneous data available from various sources as well as from newly digitized data. This paper describes the CHUAN dataset, the metadata, the quality control procedures, and the relationship to existing datasets. Some examples are given of its usefulness for analyzing weather and climate during the first half of the twentieth century. The CHUAN dataset comprises 3987 station records worldwide or about 16. 4 million profiles (of which 12. 6 million are before 1958 and 5. 3 million, primarily from pilot balloons, are before 1948). A monthly mean version can be downloaded from the World Wide Web (www. historicalupperair. org) ...|$|R
25|$|On 15 February 2012, the TAIC {{released}} an urgent safety recommendation after investigators found apparent anomalies {{in the maintenance}} of the crash balloon. The recommendation to the Civil Aviation Authority recommended that they urgently check the maintenance practices and airworthiness, especially in relation to the inspection of burners, fuel systems and envelopes, and maintenance record-keeping, of the other 74 hot air <b>balloons</b> <b>registered</b> in New Zealand.|$|R
50|$|Output {{has grown}} to around 500 {{balloons}} per year. , Cameron Balloons accounted for 1,073 of the 1,553 hot air <b>balloons</b> <b>registered</b> with the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority.Cameron Balloons is also famous for its special shapes, the first being Robertson's Golly, constructed in 1975. Most special shapes are made for commercial advertising, but some have been bought privately. Notable amongst these private buyers is the late Malcolm Forbes of Forbes magazine, who commissioned a number of special shapes, including Harley-Davidson motorbike, Sphinx, bust of Beethoven, French Chateau, Pagoda and Minaret.|$|R
50|$|In 1994, {{three years}} after the devastating effects of the Mount Pinatubo eruption, Tourism Secretary Mina Gabor, {{together}} with Korean businessman and hot-air balloon pilot, Mr. Sung Kee Paik, and British Airways General Manager, Mr. John Emery, and the German aviation enthusiast Max Motschmann engineered the first ever Philippine International Hot Air Balloon Fiesta to help jumpstart the local economy and spirit of the Central Luzon region with the commitment of developing hot air ballooning as an aviation sport in the country and making the Philippines one of the leading sports aviation and travel destinations in the Asia Pacific region. The 1994 event originally organized by the Department of Tourism (DOT), the Hot Air Balloon Club, the Clark Development Corporation and British Airways initially began with 21 balloon pilots from 10 countries and one entry from the Philippines, represented by Capt. Joy Roa, the only <b>registered</b> Filipino <b>balloon</b> pilot at that time. The success of the festival in 1994 brought about {{an increase in the number}} of participants in 1995 to 27 balloons including a basketless one-man balloon and two entries from the Philippines. The 1995 festival also saw the introduction of ultra light planes to the events.|$|R
