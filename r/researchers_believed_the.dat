Many residents soon became frustrated by the rate of robberies and murders. In late 1863 they formed a committee of vigilantes (the Montana Vigilantes) to combat the rash of murders and robberies.|$|E
50|$|The Floed-Lane House, {{also known}} as the Creed Floed House, is a Classical Revival house in Roseburg, Oregon. It was {{completed}} in 1854, although some <b>researchers</b> <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> year was 1860. The house is a standard, two up and two down design with upper and lower story porches. It was home to the daughter of Joseph Lane and generations of descendants of the Lane family until it was donated to the Douglas County Historical Society in 1960, following damage sustained in the Roseburg Blast of 1959. The Lane family intended the gift as a memorial to Joseph Lane and family.|$|E

50|$|The anatomy for {{auditory}} reception {{is similar}} to other odontocetes, with a hollow mandible and a mandibular fat body composed of a low density outer layer and a denser inner core. The inner core comes into {{direct contact with the}} tympanoperiotic complex (functionally similar to the auditory bulla in other species - see Cetacea). Hearing tests performed on two live individuals brought in for rehabilitation exhibited frequency response range and temporal resolution similar to that found in other echolocating dolphins. During those tests, one individual exhibited low frequency hearing loss that might have been related to treatment with the antibiotic amikacin although the <b>researchers</b> <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> more likely cause was slight differences in testing setup.|$|E
50|$|Functional imaging of {{the brain}} has shown that {{self-control}} is correlated with an area in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), {{a part of the}} frontal lobe. This area is distinct from those involved in generating intentional actions, attention to intentions, or select between alternatives. This control occurs through the top-down inhibition of premotor cortex. There is some debate about the mechanism of self-control and how it emerges. Traditionally, <b>researchers</b> <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> bottom-up approach guided self-control behavior. The more time a person spends thinking about a rewarding stimulus, the more likely he or she will experience a desire for it. Information that is most important gains control of working memory, and can then be processed through a top-down mechanism. Increasing evidence suggests that top down processing plays a strong role in self-control. Specifically, top-down processing can actually regulate bottom-up attentional mechanisms. To demonstrate this, researchers studied working memory and distraction by presenting participants with neutral or negative pictures and then a math problem or no task. They found that participants reported less negative moods after solving the math problem compared to the no task group, which was due to an influence on working memory capacity.|$|E
50|$|Research on {{understanding}} media effects {{have gone through}} 3 phases during the 20th century. From the 1920s to 1940s <b>researchers</b> <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> media had a powerful effect on its audience. This assumes the audience is passive and uncritical of the media’s messages. This phase {{is characterized by the}} Hypodermic needle model or Bullet Theory. This theory was used to explain how World War II propaganda changed behavior - convincing men to join the service, housewives to change food habits, and improving the morale of new soldiers. From the 1940s through the 1960s, researchers believed that people were more influenced by their friends and family than the media. The minimalist effects theory includes narcotizing dysfunction because the audience withdraws from real issues and becomes passive. In this phase instead of the media telling people what to think, it tells the audience what to think about (sets the agenda). From the 1960s to today, researchers believe that the media can have both powerful and limited effects on society, depending on situational factors. The media may impact the development of attitudes, beliefs, and values, and it may be more influential on some personalities than others.|$|E

5000|$|The mission {{revealed}} {{the composition and}} meteorological nature of Venus’ atmosphere. Data from the radio science experiment measured {{the extent to which}} radio waves passing through the atmosphere were refracted, which was used to calculate the density, pressure, and temperature of the atmosphere at any given altitude. Overall, atmospheric temperature is higher closer to the planet’s surface, but Mariner 10 found four altitudes where the pattern was reversed, which could signify the presence of a layer of clouds. The inversions occurred at the 56, 61, 63, and 81 km levels, confirming previous observations made by the Mariner 5 encounter. The ultraviolet spectrometers identified the chemical substances that comprise Venus’ atmosphere. The elevated concentration of atomic oxygen in the upper atmosphere showed that the atmosphere is stratified into upper and lower layers that do not mix with each other; photographs of the upper and lower cloud layers corroborated this hypothesis. Mariner 10’s ultraviolet photographs were an invaluable information source for studying the churning clouds of Venus’ atmosphere. The mission <b>researchers</b> <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> cloud features they photographed were located in the stratosphere and upper troposphere, created by condensation; they also concluded that the contrast between darker and lighter features was due to differences in the cloud’s absorptivity of UV light. The subsolar region was of particular interest: as the sun is straight overhead, it imparts more solar energy to this area than other part of the planet. Compared {{to the rest of the}} planet’s atmosphere, the subsolar region was highly active and irregular. [...] "Cells" [...] of air lifted by convection, each up to 500 km wide, were observed forming and dissipating within the span of a few hours; some had polygonal outlines.|$|E
40|$|A study {{determined}} {{the effect of}} college-level trigonometry skills on the final grades {{of students enrolled in}} Introduction to AC/DC Circuits, the first course in the vocational electronics program at Seminole Community college (Florida). The literature was reviewed to develop a conceptual framework for the project. A pretest that measured college-level trigonometry skills was administered to each student enrolled in all sections of the course {{at the beginning of the}} Spring 1990 term. Results were used to categorize students as those with college-level trigonometry skills (control group, N= 11) and those without (experimental group, N= 14). At the end of the term, final grades for each group were averaged and a statistical comparison of the mean scores for both groups was performed. Since the <b>researchers</b> <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> control group would score higher, a two-tailed independent t-test was used. The difference between the mean scores of the control group and the experimental group was statistically significant at the. 01 level. It was recommended that the college should require a prerequisite of college-level trigonometry and modify participation in the program and that vocational faculty should teach the trigonometry skills applicable to AC circuits.
