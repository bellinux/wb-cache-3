25|$|However the waterbirds {{wintering}} on the Najafgarh drain {{may not be}} {{the ones}} responsible for air strikes at all as in 2008, the airfield environment management committee found that several illegal slaughterhouses near the airport area were attracting birds that were leading to problems for the aircraft. It was decided that these slaughterhouses should be shut down with immediate effect and the civic agencies responsible would take appropriate action. Officials highlighted six critical areas of Dwarka, Indira Market in RK Puram, Sadar Bazar, Mehram Nagar, Dabri More and Gazipur, where the illegal slaughterhouses were operating. Delhi International Airport (P) Ltd (DIAL) also adopted several other measures to deal with this problem. It used noise emitting guns to scare away birds and employed around 120 bird chasers, it also pigeon proofed all buildings and hangars to prevent the birds from nesting on the premises. Regular garbage removal and <b>rodent</b> <b>control</b> measures were put into place to discourage the birds.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the late}} 1800s, large herds of bison grazed the area {{until they were}} extirpated by human hunting, and cattle have — to a degree — taken their place as grazers, {{maintaining}} the grassland ecosystem in a mix of grazed and ungrazed patches. Pronghorn (Antilocapra Americana) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) are also present on the grasslands along with deer mice, voles, and Richardson's ground squirrel, an important food source for the ferruginous hawk and occasional burrow host to the burrowing owl. The formerly extirpated and subsequently reintroduced swift fox (Vulpes velox), currently listed as endangered provincially and downgraded to threatened nationally in 2009, is resident as well. Swift foxes were originally abundant across the prairies, but population declines caused by land use conversion, trapping, hunting, predation by domestic dogs, competition with coyotes, and <b>rodent</b> <b>control</b> programs led to their elimination from Alberta in 1938 and declared extirpated in 1978. The swift fox was reintroduced to Canada in 1983 from the progeny of a captive breeding program using Colorado and South Dakota stock, a controversial but relatively successful initiative. The current population is estimated at 647 foxes in Canada as of 2006, but predation by coyotes and golden eagles {{continues to be a}} limiting factor, with golden eagles causing 75% of the deaths of swift foxes in 1997. In addition, due to their small size and inability to see above tall vegetation, and their avoidance of agricultural lands and the associated chemical spraying which reduces their insect prey, swift foxes appear to be habitat specialists preferring shortgrass native prairie and land use conversion to agriculture is a continued threat. The area's woodland habitat is home to a herd of elk, along with porcupines, cottontail rabbits, and white-tailed deer.|$|E

40|$|Highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} (HPAI) contamination via wild birds and rodents {{poses a threat}} to food security and safety. As chicken meat comprises an increasing proportion of diet in China, it is useful to determine whether broiler farmers are adopting wild bird and <b>rodent</b> <b>controls</b> to minimize the risk of HPAI impacts on food supply. Our study surveyed a cross sectional sample of 331 Chinese broiler farmers in six provinces. We find that only 47 % of farmers (mainly farmers with large herds) adopted control measures against wild birds and rodents, while 14 % adopted no measures. Farm size was the biggest driver of adoption followed by proportion of farm revenue derived from broiler production. However, southern farmers were at a far greater probability of non-adoption. We suggest that assistance in the form of education/training programs and subsidized traps or baiting controls across smaller producers could help raise of the adoption level toward more effective HPAI control.

40|$|Inter-male {{competition}} is typically used {{to account for}} the male-biased sexual size dimorphism (MSSD) frequently found in mammals. In contrast, although they are not rare, mammalian systems exhibiting female-biased sexual size dimorphism (FSSD) have been poorly accounted for in sexual size dimorphism (SSD) theory across the mammalian spectrum. In addition to demonstrating unambiguous FSSD, male Tarrkawarra (Notomys alexis) have one of the lowest known mammalian testis to body mass ratios. These features make Tarrkawarra an ideal system for further investigating theories of mammalian SSD and alternative social organisation. In the current study we assessed evidence of sexual selection for FSSD in this Australian arid-zone <b>rodent.</b> <b>Controlling</b> for familiarity and relatedness, affiliative preference experiments were run in conjunction with assays of female reproductive state. We found evidence for mate choice in changed patterns of time allocation and visit frequency to stimulus conspecifics {{over the course of the}} female reproductive phase. Preferences associated with increased familiarity and size of affiliative partners also indicate a complex interaction between natural and sexual selection processes in the evolution of FSSD and have implications for better understanding the social system of this little studied species. 1 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Xenon is {{a general}} {{anaesthetic}} gas with neuroprotective properties. Inhibition of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor glycine co-agonist site {{has been shown to}} mediate xenon neuroprotection against ischemic injury in vitro. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to produce point mutations in the GluN 1 subunit of rat NMDA receptors. These were then expressed in HEK 293 cells and the responses of mutant GluN 1 /GluN 2 A receptors to glycine and anaesthetics assessed using patch-clamp electrophysiology. Two mutations of the phenylalanine 758 site were found to eliminate xenon binding to the receptor without altering glycine affinity or the binding of sevoflurane and isoflurane. These selective mutations will allow for knock-in animals to be used to dissect the mechanism(s) underlying xenon neuroprotection and anaesthesia in vivo. The ability of the other noble gases (helium, neon, argon, and krypton) to influence two known molecular targets of xenon – the NMDA receptor and the TREK- 1 channel – was also assessed using patch-clamp electrophysiology. These were found to have no influence on either NMDA receptors or TREK- 1 channels.

In this study, we performed a comparative proteomic analysis of pancreatic tissue extracts from rats with AP and healthy <b>rodent</b> <b>controls</b> {{in order to identify}} changes in protein expression related to the pathobiological processes of this disease. Pancreatic extracts from diseased and controls rats were analyzed by 2 -DE and MS/MS. A total of 125 proteins were identified from both samples. Comparative analysis allowed the detection of 42 proteins or protein fragments differentially expressed between diseased and control pancreas, some of them being newly described in AP. Interestingly, these changes were representative of the main pathobiological pathways involved in this disease. We observed activation of digestive proteases and increased expression of various inflammatory markers, including several members of the alpha-macroglobulin family. We also detected changes related to oxidative and cell stress responses. Finally, we highlighted modifications of 14 - 3 - 3 proteins that could be related to apoptosis regulation.
