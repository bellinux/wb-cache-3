[...] Nick Douglas explained that the group decided to shift their strategy away from the attacks to Scientology websites: [...] "Anonymous even decided that they were going to stop that attack, that it was a bad idea. It's the usual thing they used to do when they really hadn't had a thought out plan, and here they're realizing they actually have to figure out some real plan against a real enemy." ...|$|E
