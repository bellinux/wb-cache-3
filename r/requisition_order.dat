500|$|By early 1918, {{many cities}} in western Russia faced famine {{as a result}} of chronic food shortages. Lenin blamed this on the kulaks, or wealthier peasants, who {{allegedly}} hoarded the grain that they had produced to increase its financial value. In May 1918, he issued a <b>requisitioning</b> <b>order</b> that established armed detachments to confiscate grain from kulaks for distribution in the cities, and in June called for the formation of Committees of Poor Peasants to aid in requisitioning. This policy resulted in vast social disorder and violence, as armed detachments often clashed with peasant groups, helping to {{set the stage for the}} civil war. A prominent example of Lenin's views was his August 1918 telegram to the Bolsheviks of Penza, which called upon them to suppress a peasant insurrection by publicly hanging at least 100 [...] "known kulaks, rich men, [...] bloodsuckers".|$|R

Shortly thereafter, dozens of Orthodox Jews moved to the village in order to show support for the continued settlement of the area.The Homesh Yeshiva has endeavoured to retain some hold on the area by sleeping in nearby caves. The IDF maintained a <b>requisition</b> <b>order</b> to impede Palestinians from returning to the land for eight years, and only rescinded it when the case came up before the Supreme Court in 2013.

50|$|The college {{now stands}} {{on what was}} once holy ground, being {{the site of a}} Roman Catholic church named St. Anthony's built in 1892 'ex voto'. St. Anthony's was later {{demolished}} and replaced by an eponymous church in Pokfulam Road, which still stands today. Beside St Anthony's stood the Sacred Heart Chapel (1864-1892). This was built a few years before St Anthony's was built by the architect Mr. M.A. D'Aquino, and blessed in March 1879. The land jointly occupied by the church and the chapel was named Inland Lot 755, and was the property of the Roman Catholic Church. Sometime after the construction of St Anthony's, probably because having two churches in such close proximity was seen as an inefficient use of holy land, the Sacred Heart Chapel was converted into an orphanage and school under the care of the Canossian Sisters - the Ling Yuet Sin Kindergarten of the present day. In 1920 the prologue to the school's story was written. It took the form of a <b>requisition</b> <b>order</b> by government authorities for a portion of Inland Lot 755, the section where the Church of St Anthony stood.|$|E

By February 1994, the People's Government of Shenzhen entered into an agreement with the International Golf Association, announcing that Mission Hills Golf Club would be the host venue for the 1995 World Cup of Golf - the first international golf tournament in China. That year, an estimated 30,000 fans lined the fairways to see the United States team of Fred Couples and Davis Love III win its fourth consecutive World Cup title by 14 strokes over Australia (Brett Ogle and Robert Allenby).|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the artifact-centric {{approach}} to business process modeling, this paper proposes a notation named ACTA that provides two equivalent forms of representation: in one, all the life cycles of the artifacts involved in the business under consideration are shown in a single model, while in the other they are defined in separate models. The latter may be easier to understand when the model is large but requires synchronization points between life cycles: two kinds of mechanisms, i. e., driven transitions and driven tasks are analyzed in this paper. The major feature of ACTA is its nature of data flow language: the activation of tasks depends on the presence of suitable input entities rather than on the precedence relationships between tasks as it takes place in the conventional activity-centric approach. The advantage is the ease with which a number of situations that are difficult to handle with the activity-centric approach can be managed. Such situations encompass the selection of homogeneous entities to be processed in batches and the many-to-many mapping between entities of different types, such as <b>requisition</b> <b>orders</b> and procurement order...|$|R

In April 1918 he issued the declaration of [...] "Merciless war against these kulaks! Death to them!". With a booming black market supplementing the official state-sanctioned economy, he also called on speculators, black marketeers and looters to be shot. To ensure compliance, he issued the decree that [...] "in every grain-growing district, 25-30 rich hostages should be taken who will answer with their lives for the collection and loading of all surpluses." [...] A prominent example of Lenin's views on the matter was provided in the August 1918 telegram that he sent to the Bolsheviks of Penza, in which he called upon them to suppress a peasant insurrection by publicly hanging at least 100 [...] "known kulaks, rich men, and bloodsuckers".This policy resulted in vast social disorder and violence, with the armed detachments clashing with peasant groups, providing much fuel for the developing civil war, with Lenin biographer Louis Fischer describing it as a [...] "civil-war-within-the-civil-war". The requisitioning efforts disincentived peasants from producing more grain than they could personally consume, and thus production slumped. The policy caused controversy; at the Fifth All-Russian Congress of Soviets, held in Moscow in July 1918, the SRs and Left SRs condemned the use of these armed detachments to procure grain. Realising that the Committees of Poor Peasants had turned upon the 'Middle Peasants' who were not kulaks and that they had contributed to the peasantry's increased alienation from the government, in December 1918 Lenin declared their abolition.He also called upon those workers who lacked discipline to be punished accordingly.|$|R
