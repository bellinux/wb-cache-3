30|$|There {{are only}} few studies on coal {{gasification}} in two-stage entrained-flow gasifier found in World Wide Web. Moreover, no study on coal gasification under CO 2 -rich condition in two-stage entrained-flow gasifier is found. Chen et al. [4, 5] performed {{a series of}} numerical simulations under various operating conditions for a two-stage air blown entrained-flow gasifier. It was reported that increasing air ratio leads to increased CO 2 and decreased CO and H 2 concentrations, and accordingly, had a strong effect on the heating value of the product gas. The effect of air/coal partitioning to the two stages, and the feed rate of <b>recycle</b> <b>char</b> {{was found to be}} limited. Silaen et al. [6] conducted numerical simulation of coal gasification process inside a two-stage entrained-flow coal gasifier. They reported that smaller particles produced more CO and less CO 2 which result in an increased syngas heating value. Luan et al. [2] studied the simulation of the coal combustion and gasification processes in a two-stage entrained-flow gasifier using the finite rate model for heterogeneous reactions. They reported that the increased O 2 /coal ratio leads to higher exit temperature and CO 2 concentration, but lower CO concentration, resulting in a decrease of syngas heating value. However, the soot formation, which is of significant environmental concern, is still being neglected in the past studies of coal gasification [2, 4, 5, 6]. Soot formation has been observed in many pulverized coal utilization processes, including coal gasification and combustion. The formation of soot during coal gasification causes substantial heat losses due to radiative heat transfer. Therefore, an understanding of soot formation and its mechanism is necessary for the better design of coal gasification systems.|$|E
40|$|Chemical looping {{gasification}} (CLG) {{is considered}} as a novel gasification technology because gas-phase oxygen of the gasifying medium can be replaced by lattice oxygen of the oxygen carrier. The gasifying mediums (e. g., pure O- 2 and steam) used as the oxygen source can apparently improve the char conversion in traditionally biomass gasification. Similarly, {{the objective of this}} study is to investigate char CLG with the oxygen carrier as an individual oxygen source. A NiO-modified iron ore oxygen carrier was prepared by the impregnation method coupled with ultrasonic treatment. The characteristics of the oxygen carrier were analyzed by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and H- 2 temperature-programmed reduction (H- 2 -TPR). The formation of spinel-type nickel iron oxide NiFe 2 O 4 can evidently enhance the reactivity of the oxygen carrier. The reduction of the oxygen carrier by biomass char was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) together with a fixed-bed reactor under an inert atmosphere. TGA tests show that the reactivity of the oxygen carrier increased with the increase of NiO loading. An optimal mass ratio of char/oxygen carrier is determined at 4 : 6 With the aim of obtaining a maximum reaction rate. The presence of spinel-type nickel iron oxide NiFe 2 O 4 apparently improved the reaction rate of char gasification. The fixed-bed gasification results show that CO was generated faster than other components because carbon was partially oxidized and H- 2 was quickly consumed by the lattice oxygen [O] of the oxygen carrier. A relatively high carbon conversion of 55. 56 % was obtained in the char CLG, in comparison to that of char pyrolysis (5. 52 %). The lattice oxygen [O] of the oxygen carrier was fully consumed by biomass char. Moreover, biomass char was catalytically, pyrolyzed becausee the deep reduction products (metallic iron and nickel) can act as catalysts for char pyrolysis. XRD analysis shows that the oxygen carrier was deeply reduced into Fe (Ni) alloy and Fe 3 C species during the reduction stage of Char CLG. However, the. regenerated oxygen carrier after oxidation can be <b>recycled</b> for <b>char</b> CLG on the basis of XRD and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses...|$|R
40|$|Fluidized bed {{reactors}} {{have become}} attractive process alternatives {{for carrying out}} solid-gas reactions. Predicting {{the performance of a}} noncatalytic reactor often requires accounting for the changing characteristics of the solid reactant as reaction progresses. Past modelling efforts have been restricted to monosized feeds and been computationally cumbersome. The method described in Part I permits the description of a reacting particle according to any of several limiting case models. The solution of the balance equations by orthogonal collocation allows both monodispersed and polydispersed feed distributions to be treated with equal ease. Extensions to a wider range of applications including several options for particle attrition are also discussed. ^ Part II presents a series of examples that demonstrate the flexibility of the model discussed in Part I. A fluidized bed combustor model is compared with experimental results of Babcock and Wilcox. The behavior near the distributor is a key to the composition profiles. The combustion (fixed carbon) efficiency was found to be most strongly related to single particle elutriation and reaction rates [...] effects well represented by the more detailed description of solid behavior. Parametric studies for a steam fed gasifier reveal that here too grid effects may overshadow bubble behavior. A model of a steam fed gasifier with external <b>char</b> <b>recycle</b> showed that a significant reduction in conversion resulted from heating the recirculating char. Finally, an examination of a steam-oxygen-char gasifer indicated that the behavior of the ash, whether or not it attrites, may be as important a factor as {{the manner in which the}} particle reacts. ...|$|R
