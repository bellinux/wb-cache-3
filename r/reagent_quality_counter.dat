The electrochemiluminescent assays commonly employed for ADA measurement use drug conjugated with ruthenium and biotin to bind ADA in samples. Here we report an association between high nonspecific ADA responses in certain drug-naïve individuals and the storage buffer of the conjugated reagents used in a monoclonal antibody ADA assay. Ruthenylated reagents stored in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer had increased levels of aggregate and produced variable and high baseline responses in some subjects. Reagents stored in a histidine-sucrose buffer (HSB) had lower aggregate levels and produced low sample responses. In contrast to PBS, conjugated reagents formulated in HSB remained low in aggregate content and in sample response variability after 5 freeze/thaw cycles.

The methods used for comparison included two radioimmunoassays, one with enzyme labelling, two with fluorescence enhanced enzyme reactions and 3 luminescence immunoassays. In most cases, the precision of the ES 300 lay between 2 and 5 % in all assays in the concentration ranges of clinical interest.

40|$|Purpose – The paper’s {{aim is to}} {{show the}} {{development}} of materials and methods which allow freeform fabrication of macroscopic Zn-air electrochemical batteries. Freedom of geometric design may allow for new possibilities in performance optimization. Design/methodology/approach – The authors have formulated battery materials which are compatible with solid freeform fabrication (SFF) while retaining electrochemical functionality. Using SFF processes, they have fabricated six Zn-air cylindrical batteries and quantitatively characterized them and comparable commercial batteries. They analyze their performance in light of models from the literature and they also present SFF of a flexible twocell battery of unusual geometry. Findings – Under continuous discharge to 0. 25 V/cell with a 100 V load, the cylindrical cells have a specific energy and power density {{in the range of}} 40 - 70 J/g and 0. 4 - 1 mW/cm 2, respectively, with a mass range of 8 - 18 g. The commercial Zn-air button cells tested produce 30 - 750 J/g and 7 - 9 mW/cm 2 under the same conditions, and have a mass range of 0. 2 - 2 g. The two-cell, flexible Zn-air battery produces a nominal 2. 8 V, open-circuit. Research limitations/implications – The freeform-fabricated batteries have, 10 percent of the normalized performance of the commercial batteries. High-internal contact resistance, loss of electrolyte through evaporation, and inferior catalyst <b>reagent</b> <b>quality</b> are possible causes of inferior performance. Complicated material preparation and battery fabrication processes have limited the number of batteries fabricated and characterized, limiting the statistical significance of the results.

The customers' satisfaction towards the service <b>quality</b> of <b>counter</b> service can be measured with five important elements of SERVQUAL which are tangibility, reliability, responsiveness, assurance and empathy. The sample was randomly selected from the customers of the local municipal councils at several locations in Melaka, which are Jasin, Hang Tuah Jaya, Melal(a Tengah and Alor Gajah by using probability sampling method. Simple convenience random sampling technique was chosen to select the sample size. The data were analyzed using the Statistical Pacl(age in the Social Science Software (SPSS) version 20. 0 to measure the impact of these five independent variables on tIle customers' satisfaction towards the local municipal councils at Melal(a. The total of 120 was distributed and analyzed by tal(ing 30 questionnaires for each location.

40|$|AbstractDynamic range {{limitations}} are challenging to proteomics, particularly in clinical samples. Affinity proteomics partially overcomes this, yet suffers from dependence on <b>reagent</b> <b>quality.</b> SOMAscan, an aptamer-based platform for over 1000 proteins, avoids that issue using nucleic acid binders. Targets include low expressed proteins not easily accessible by other approaches. Here {{we report on}} the potential of SOMAscan for the study of differently sourced mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in comparison to LC-MS/MS and RNA sequencing. While targeting fewer analytes, SOMAscan displays high precision and dynamic range coverage, allowing quantification of proteins not measured by the other platforms. Expression between cell types (ESC and MSC) was compared across techniques and uncovered the expected large differences. Sourcing was investigated by comparing subtypes: bone marrow-derived, standard in clinical studies, and ESC-derived MSC, thought to hold similar potential but devoid of inter-donor variability and proliferating faster in vitro. We confirmed subtype-equivalency, as well as vesicle and extracellular matrix related processes in MSC. In contrast, the proliferative nature of ESC was captured less by SOMAscan, where nuclear proteins are underrepresented. The complementary of SOMAscan allowed the comprehensive exploration of CD markers and signaling molecules, not readily accessible otherwise and offering unprecedented potential in subtype characterization. SignificanceMesenchymal stem cells (MSC) represent promising stem cell-derived therapeutics as indicated by their application in > 500 clinical trials currently registered with the NIH. Tissue-derived MSC require invasive harvesting and imply donor-to-donor differences, to which embryonic stem cell (ESC) -derived MSC may provide an alternative and thus warrant thorough characterization. In continuation of our previous study where we compared in depth embryonic stem cells (ESC) and MSC from two sources (bone marrow and ESC-derived), we included the aptamer-based SOMAscan assay, complementing LC-MS/MS and RNA-seq data.
