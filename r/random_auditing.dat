40|$|Some {{academics}} and politicians {{have proposed that}} taxpayers should be reimbursed for costs of randomly imposed tax audits, because, they argue, randomly imposing audit costs is unfair. But none of those proposing audit compensation has explained why randomly imposed audit costs are unfair, or why, if these randomly imposed costs are unfair, this unfairness necessarily means that taxpayers should be compensated. These are important questions, because explicit randomness is an essential tool for tax enforcement, and for other areas of law, but its use may be limited if randomness is equated with unfairness. The Article argues that it is fair not to compensate randomly audited taxpayers for their audit costs, because the available of insurance against <b>random</b> <b>audit</b> costs cures fairness concerns under luck egalitarianism. Fairness may nonetheless matter for a less obvious reason: notwithstanding philosophical arguments to the contrary, individuals may perceive <b>random</b> <b>audits</b> as unfair. Empirical work has shown that individuals have a taste for fairness in tax law, and that the perception that tax law is unfair may reduce tax compliance. Therefore, perceived unfairness should be of concern to welfarists, among others. Based on a comparison of <b>random</b> <b>audits</b> with other burdens randomly imposed by the government, the Article concludes that perceived unfairness may warrant nominal compensation for <b>random</b> <b>audit</b> costs. The costs of the perceived unfairness of <b>random</b> <b>audits,</b> as opposed to other types of randomly imposed burdens, may be particularly high because of general ignorance about, and negative perceptions of, our tax system. Compensation for <b>random</b> <b>audit</b> costs is therefore warranted {{not because it is}} actually unfair to impose audit costs randomly, but rather because such compensation may help to overcome perceptions of unfairness and thus to increase overall tax compliance...|$|R

The privately informed debtor has a stochastic return; once he knows the state realisation, auditing and cheating are determined as Nash equilibria. The literature assumes that this leads to randomised cheating and auditing. In this paper we verify that the contract may involve this randomisation; but that it may also involve truthtelling with <b>random</b> <b>auditing</b> and one or more investors in line with Persons (1996); or a single state independent repayment with no auditing.

On the other hand under limited liability if the cost of observation is large relative to the lowest state revenue, the <b>random</b> <b>auditing</b> contract or a constrained two investor truthtelling contract may be optimal.

We employ this idea to support efficient outcomes in repeated games with imperfect monitoring, when information is severely limited. In particular, we show that efficiency can be improved when the players randomize and condition their future actions both on the signal and their actions. Firstly, we show that in a version of Radner, Myerson and Maskin's example of inefficient partnership, efficiency can be achieved by such (i. e., privately mixed strategy) equilibria. Secondly, we show that the folk theorem under imperfect public monitoring can be extended to the case with a small signal space by means of mixed strategy equilibria with communication. In particular, we show that for generic symmetric games with at least four players, we can drop the Fudenberg-Levine-Maskin condition on the number of actions and signals altogether and prove the folk theorem under the same condition as in the perfect monitoring case. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{develops a}} formal {{model of a}} primary equity market in which costly state verification and asymmetric information require auditing policies and enforcement power to guarantee an efficient (second best) equilibrium and avoid market failure. The model captures some essential features of Third World capital markets, including unequal investment opportunity sets and the related asymmetry in information that results from {{a small group of}} insiders having controlling interests in most firms. ^ The model is sued to determine the optimal financial contract that is incentive compatible under the assumed asymmetric information structure and strict limited liability. Firms have random returns which can be verified by costly audits. A contract specifies the payoffs to the parties for each distinguishable state of nature, and the auditing procedure to be followed. Allowing for <b>random</b> <b>auditing,</b> a class of contracts is shown to be optimal under the condition that payoffs be restricted to fixed fractions of verified returns. This class of contracts encompasses both standard debt contracts and standard equity contracts. The exact nature of the optimal contract is shown to depend on the probability distribution of returns. ^ If more than one contract is allowed, it is shown that an optimal capital structure arises from the trade off between the agency costs associated with different financial contracts. ...|$|E

On the contrary, aquaculture contributed 15 % (260, 800 mt) {{of the total}} fish production (49. 0 % marine fish and 51. 0 % freshwater fish). An estimated 150, 000 mt FBCs were processed to fish meal (FM) producing 30, 000 mt FM annually. In 2013, 16, 600 mt of FM, valued at MYR 50 million (USD 15. 6 million) were exported while 7, 700 mt valued at MYR 33 million (USD 10. 3 million) were imported. FBCs may consist of fish, crustaceans, mollusks and others. The quality of each FBC sample differs depending {{on the amount of}} fish and varies with the season and fishing ground. The use of FM, plant protein sources and fish oil (FO) in the aquafeed industry is not known. However, based on marine fish and shrimp feed price, the use of FM and FO in aquafeed was estimated to be 30 - 40 %. Studies on FM and FO replacement in aquafeed using poultry by-product meal, fermented shrimp head waste, soybean meal, palm oil and soybean oil as well as the use of biofloc technology in white shrimp farming were also discussed. In order to improve feed and feeding practices, Department of Fisheries, Malaysia conducted good aquaculture practices on feeding management, feed formulation and fish nutrition courses to stakeholders (farmers and government officials). In addition, there are measures taken to monitor feed and feeding practices through <b>random</b> <b>auditing</b> process in aquaculture farms in Malaysia based on Good Aquaculture Practices (MyGAP) and Animal Feed Act 2009. Due to the increasing price of FM and FO, the aquafeed industry has started to replace in the feed formulations since the increasing feed cost has hindered farmers from buying aquafeed. As a result, there were traces of porcine DNA detected in almost all commercial aquafeed. Additionally, aquaculture farmers tend to formulate their own farm-made aquafeed instead of using commercial pellets. Thus, in order to sustain fish production, Department Fisheries promotes farming and consumption of omnivorous and herbivorous fish species as tilapia, catfish and grass carp. In addition, the Department of Fisheries also organizes Aquaculture Practices Awareness programs among aquafeed manufacturers and farmers to implement relevant rules and act to reduce the use of FM and FO. Lastly, research and development on FM and FO substitution in aquafeed with locally available ingredients are still ongoing and being done by Department of Fisheries, universities and the private sector...|$|E
