40|$|The law of treaty {{reservations}} - {{which enables}} states {{to ask that}} their multilateral obligations be tailored to their individual preferences - has been controversial for over fifty years, and is at present subject to pitched battles within (and between) the International Law Commission and numerous other international institutions. There is broad agreement that existing scheme under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties involves a sharp tradeoff between honoring the unalloyed consent of non-reserving states (that is, those agreeing to the treaty as originally negotiated, which may object to proposed reservations) and respecting the conditioned consent of reserving states; moreover, it is thought to decisively favor the latter, leading to a surplus of treaty reservations and a paucity of objections to them. The ambiguities that pervade the Convention are said to play a supporting role. Whatever their cause, it is thought, such ambiguities tend to disadvantage non-reserving states; the straightforward solution is to resolve those ambiguities, preferably by making reservations harder to pull off. This approach is seriously flawed. In fact, the law of treaty reservations - understood as reflecting, rather than surmounting, its frustrating ambiguities - plausibly serves the interests of its supposed victims, the non-reserving states, perhaps even {{to a greater degree}} than for inveterate <b>reservers.</b> Treaty reservations not only increase the breadth of treaty participation, but permit agreement on broader commitments than would otherwise be possible. These effects inure to the benefit of reserving and non-reserving states alike. But deeper commitments, coupled with reservations, also establish a reliable, low-cost mechanism for providing information on reserving states, something facilitated by the existing scheme 2 ̆ 7 s eccentricities. Those same eccentricities also enable non-reserving states to reserve their own judgment regarding the acceptability of reservations, and thus shift risk control back (somewhat) in their favor...|$|R

The advantages and limitations of using gamma-irradiation of less than 1 M rad have been re-evaluated and compared with previous tests at the Halifax laboratory in terms of physical, organoleptic and some post process quality assessments. Cod, mackerel, and scallop were chosen as the models for lean, fatty and shell fish respectively. The irradiation process can prevent bacterial spoilage in fish, particularly when chilling and/or handling practices are inadequate, but the potential catalytic influences on enzymatic and chemical deterioration during the post-mortem period should also be considered. Some considerations and reservations concerning the changes in overall quality for irradiated fish are discussed.

Recently, ii {{has been}} suggested that hyaluronan {{can be used as a}} controlled and localized delivery vehicle for diclofenac in the treatment of a variety of conditions including osteoarthritic pain, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of hyaluronan on the in-vitro diffusion and deposition of diclofenac within the skin. The studies involved full thickness, epidermal sheet and stratum corneum human shin sections in an in-vitro Franz cell model, in which the diffusion and deposition of C- 14 -labelled diclofenac and H- 3 -labelled hyaluronan was investigated The results showed that the diffusion of C- 14 -labelled diclofenac was sustained and controlled by hyaluronan as compared to a buffer control, that a depot or. <b>reserver</b> of the drug was formed in the epidermis and that it was probably this layer that determined the rate of release of diclofenac within the skin.

40|$|BackgroundWhile single {{growth factor}} has {{limitation}} to induce optimal neovascularization, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an autologous <b>reserver</b> of various growth factors. However, {{little is known}} about the mechanism of PRP-related neovascularization. The objective of this investigation was to characterize the angiogenic and growth factor content of PRP and to determine, in vitro, its effect on endothelial cell proliferation. Additionally, this experiment sought to determine the effectiveness of different compositions of PRP (solution versus sustained release) on perfusion and neovascularization in a murine model of hind limb ischemia. MethodsDifferent growth factors were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In vivo study, we used gelatin hydrogel as a sustained release carrier for growth factors in PRP. We induced hind limb ischemia by excising right femoral artery in wild type C 57 BL 6 mice. After surgery, mice were randomly assigned to four experimental groups; control (C), 100 μL of sustained release form of platelet-poor plasma (PPP), 100 μL of solution form of PRP (PRP-sol), 100 μL of sustained release form of PRP (PRP-sr); each formulation was administered via an intramuscular injection to the ischemic hind limb. Endpoint evaluations were blood perfusion by laser Doppler perfusion image, vascular density by anti Von Willebrand factor (vWF), and mature vessel density by anti smooth muscle actin (SMA) antibody. Green fluorescent protein (GFP+) transgenic mice were generated by transplantation of bone marrow derived mononuclear cells to wild type C 57 BL 6 mice, and finally CD 34 + cell in the ischemic site of transgenic mice was detected by staining with anti-CD 34 antibody. ResultsIn vitro study showed that PRP containing different growth factors induces endothelial cell proliferation and capillary tube formation. In vivo study demonstrated that sustained release of PRP increased perfusion of ischemic tissue as measured by laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI) (57 ± 12, 56 ± 9, 72 ± 7, 98 ± 4 for groups C, PPP, PRP-sol, and PRP-sr, respectively; P <. 05); capillary density (151 ± 16, 158 ± 12, 189 ± 39, 276 ± 39 for groups C, PPP, PRP-sol, and PRP-sr, respectively, P <. 05) and mature vessel density (28 ± 2, 31 ± 3, 52 ± 10, 85 ± 13 for groups C, PPP, PRP-sol, and PRP-sr, respectively, P <. 05). Sustained release PRP also increases CD 34 + cells in the ischemic site of transgenic mice (6 ± 3 vs 18 ± 5 /mm 2 for groups control and PRP-sr respectively, P <. 05). ConclusionSustained release of PRP containing potent angiogenic growth factors restores blood perfusion presumably by stimulating angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, as well as vasculogenesis in the mouse hind limb ischemia. Clinical relevancePRP is a natural <b>reserver</b> of various growth factors that can be collected autologously and is cost effective. Thus for clinical use, no special considerations concerning antibody formation and infection risk are needed. Some clinical devices to automatically prepare PRP are available at present. PRP are consistently being used clinically in the department of orthopedics and plastic surgery (oral, maxillary facial) for a long time. On the basis of research evidence, some publications have reported positive results in either bone or soft tissue healing. However, some research concludes that there is no or little benefit from PRP. This is likely due to faster degradation of growth factors in PRP since some authors suggest using sustained release form of PRP to deliver optimal effect of PRP. Gelatin hydrogel is also being used clinically as a slow, sustained release of carrier for growth factors in our center recently...|$|E
40|$|The SOLEPUR {{process for}} the {{treatment}} of pig slurry, based on the treatment effect of the soil, was developed in France to explore the notion that a simple biobarrier approach may be a potential efficient solution to the large accumulation of liquid animal wastes residues. The unit consists of (i) a managed field (3280 m 2) which allows the total recovery of all the leachate water which percolates through growing ryegrass (Lolium perenne), to which the pig slurry is applied, (ii) a system of storage-pump-reactor for denitrification and (iii) a non-managed field for completing treatment. The process involves three operations : (1) overdosing the managed field with surplus slurry (about 1000 m 3 pig slurry/ha. year applied from 1991 to 1994, (2) collecting and treating the nitrate-rich leachate and (3) irrigation the final treated water over fields. This process decreased COD of pig slurry by 99, 9 % and removed 99, 9 % of phosphorus and approximately 80 % of nitrogen.

40|$|Denne masteroppgaven omhandler simulerte effekter av økt uregulerbar kraftproduksjon i synkronområdet Norden i 2020. Formålet er å undersøke de effekter uregulerbar produksjon, og systemets evne til automatisk regulering, har på kortsiktig frekvensstabilitet. Mengden tilgjengelige roterende <b>reserver</b> og primærreserver bestemmer systemets kortsiktige respons. Norge og Sverige inngikk i 2012 en avtale om økt energiproduksjon på 24, 6 TWh fra ny fornybar energi, kalt grønne sertifikater. Det antas at ny installert effekt fra vindkraft og uregulerbar vannkraft vil være ca. 12 500 MW i 2020. Disse prognosene er studert i simuleringsprogrammet Aristo. Simuleringene i Aristo viser frekvensforløp til identiske utfall av forbruk og produksjon, der systemets frekvens logges i 45 sekunder etter utfallet finner sted. Utfallene av forbruk og produksjon er basert på dimensjonerende utfall for Norge og synkronsystemet Norden, og er av størrelsesorden 850 MW, 1200 MW og 1360 MW. Utfallene er simulert i produksjonssituasjoner som representerer 2014 og 2020. Vi kan se fra simuleringen at systemet har en høyere H-verdi i 2014, enn i 2020. Resultatene viser at systemets reguleringsevne svekkes med økt andel uregulerbar kraft i samtlige produksjons- og lastsituasjoner. Bare ett av tre scenarier simulert for 2020 overholdt dagens krav til systemets reguleringskapasitet. Resultatene fra simuleringene i Aristo lot seg ikke separeres i effekter som skyldes ny uregulerbar produksjon eller av endret kraftflyt. Simulatorprogrammet Aristo er derfor ikke godt egnet til å studere mekanismene bak de simulerte frekvensforløp i Norden og er bedre egnet for spenningsanalyser og frekvensanalyser i øydrift for mindre avgrensede områder. Det er krav om at frekvensstabiliteten ikke skal svekkes for å unngå problemer og kostnader for forbrukerne. Det betyr økte systemkostnader for systemansvarlig. Økte balanseringskostnader dekkes av økt innmatingstariff for samtlige kraftprodusenter. Dette bryter med et prinsipp for samfunnsøkonomi som tilsier at en enhet som påfører systemet en kostnad, bør belastes kostnaden. Felles innmatingstariff for samtlige kraftprodusenter begrunnes med politisk vedtatt satsningen på økt utbygging av fornybar kraft. Abstract This thesis {{analyses}} simulated {{effects of}} increased installed unregulated {{power in the}} interconnected grid in the Nordic countries in 2020. The purpose {{is to examine the}} effects of new renewable production, and the system's ability to maintain a short-term frequency stability. The total rotatational inertia and primary frequency control are the short-term frequency responses of the power system. The agreement on green certificates from 2012, will initiate new renewable energy production of total 24, 6 TWh in Norway and Sweden. It is believed that the installed capacity of wind turbines and small-scale hydropower will be 12 500 MW by 2020. This prognosis is further studied in the simulation program Aristo. The simulations in Aristo show the development of the system frequency at losses of consumption or production. The system frequency is logged for 45 seconds after the fault occurs. The frequency deviations that occur when consumption or production is lost, is dimentional to the size of the incident. The size of the faults studied, are the biggest faults the power system of Nordic synchronous area are designed to handle. Fault sizes are 850 MW, 1200 MW and 1360 MW. The faults are simulated in different production modes which represent year 2014 and 2020. We can see from the simulation that the system reaches a higher frequency, and the frequency deviation is bigger at identical incidents in 2020 from 2014. The results show that the system frequency control deteriorates with increased amount of wind and small-scale hydropower production units. Only one of the three scenarios simulated for 2020, complied within the limits of the required control capacity of the power system. The effects arising from renewable power production, or from the change of system power flow, could not be isolated or determinated in the simulations. Aristo is therefore not well suited for analysis of total power system stability of the interconnected synchrounous grid. Aristo is better suited for analysis which involves voltage deviations and stability, or frequency analysis studied in grid islands. A decrease in frequency stability, leads to increased demand for frequency control. The TSO`s demand for primary control increase, meaning increased system stability costs. The increased system operating costs, are today covered by tariffs for all power producers. This violates a principle of economics, that indicates that a unit that inflicts the system a cost, should be charged by this cost. Equal increase of tariffs for all power producers, is justified by the political focus on increased development of renewable energy. M-B...|$|E
