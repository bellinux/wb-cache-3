5|$|A {{chelator}} for binding a <b>radioisotope</b> can be attached. Pendetide, {{a derivative}} of pentetic acid, {{is used for}} example in capromab pendetide to chelate indium-111. If the drug contains a <b>radioisotope,</b> {{the name of the}} isotope precedes the name of the antibody. Consequently, indium (111In) capromab pendetide is the name for the above example including indium-111.|$|E
5|$|As {{also noted}} below, {{the most common}} isotopic {{molybdenum}} application involves molybdenum-99, which is a fission product.

5|$|NASA {{has made}} use of {{technologies}} such as the Multi-Mission <b>Radioisotope</b> Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG), which {{is a type of}} <b>Radioisotope</b> thermoelectric generator used on space missions.

5|$|Technetium (99mTc) pintumomab and {{technetium}} (99mTc) nofetumomab merpentan are radiolabeled antibodies, merpentan being a chelator {{that links}} the antibody nofetumomab to the <b>radioisotope</b> technetium-99m.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{fraction}} of a <b>radioisotope's</b> atoms decaying per unit of time is inversely proportional to its half-life, the relative radioactivity of a quantity of buried human radioactive waste would diminish over time compared to natural <b>radioisotopes</b> (such as the decay chain of 120 trillion tons of thorium and 40 trillion tons of uranium which are at relatively trace concentrations of parts per million each over the crust's 3 ton mass). For instance, over a timeframe of thousands of years, after the most active short half-life <b>radioisotopes</b> decayed, burying U.S. nuclear waste would increase the radioactivity in the top 2000 feet of rock and soil in the United States (10 million km2) by ≈ 1 part in 10 million over the cumulative amount of natural <b>radioisotopes</b> in such a volume, although {{the vicinity of the}} site would have a far higher concentration of artificial <b>radioisotopes</b> underground than such an average.|$|R
40|$|Abstract-The <b>radioisotopes</b> {{technologies}} have become popular tools in different applications in industry, medicine, agriculture, hydrology, and environment. This paper discusses some industrial <b>radioisotopes</b> applications. The <b>radioisotopes</b> {{can be used}} to troubleshoot and optimise several industrial processes. The main advantages of using these technologies are physico-chemical compatibility, high detection sensitivity, in-site detection, and the availability of a number of radiotracers for different phases. The required steps for using <b>radioisotopes</b> in industry are presented starting from the plant visit to writing the final report. The industrial <b>radioisotopes</b> applications presented in this paper are residence time distribution (RTD) measurement, mixing time measurement, flow rate measurement, detection of blockage or leak location in buried pipelines, scanning of the distillation columns (Radiometry), and weld defect detection in pipelines (Radiography). The paper presents three new trends in these applications. These trends are RTD signal processing, RTD signal identification, and automatic defect detection in radiography images. I...|$|R

5|$|All of the {{alkali metals}} except lithium and caesium {{have at least}} one {{naturally}} occurring radioisotope: sodium-22 and sodium-24 are trace radioisotopes produced cosmogenically, potassium-40 and rubidium-87 have very long half-lives and thus occur naturally, and all isotopes of francium are radioactive. Caesium was also thought to be radioactive in the early 20th century, although it has no naturally occurring radioisotopes. (Francium had not been discovered yet at that time.) The natural long-lived <b>radioisotope</b> of potassium, potassium-40, makes up about 0.012% of natural potassium, and thus natural potassium is weakly radioactive. This natural radioactivity became a basis for a mistaken claim of the discovery for element 87 (the next alkali metal after caesium) in 1925. Natural rubidium is similarly slightly radioactive, with 27.83% being the long-lived <b>radioisotope</b> rubidium-87.|$|E

50|$|The Control of <b>Radioisotopes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|All of the {{elements}} have some isotopes that are radioactive (<b>radioisotopes),</b> although {{not all of these}} <b>radioisotopes</b> occur naturally. The <b>radioisotopes</b> typically decay into other elements upon radiating an alpha or beta particle. If an element has isotopes that are not radioactive, these are termed [...] "stable" [...] isotopes. All of the known stable isotopes occur naturally (see primordial isotope). The many <b>radioisotopes</b> that are not found in nature have been characterized after being artificially made. Certain elements have no stable isotopes and are composed only of radioactive isotopes: specifically {{the elements}} without any stable isotopes are technetium (atomic number 43), promethium (atomic number 61), and all observed elements with atomic numbers greater than 82.|$|R
5|$|Beryllium also {{releases}} neutrons under bombardment by gamma rays. Thus, natural beryllium bombarded {{either by}} alphas or gammas from a suitable <b>radioisotope</b> {{is a key}} component of most radioisotope-powered nuclear reaction neutron sources for the laboratory production of free neutrons.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt-57 (Co-57 or 57Co) is a cobalt <b>radioisotope</b> {{most often}} used in medical tests, as a {{radiolabel}} for vitamin B uptake, and for the Schilling test.

For instance, over a timeframe of thousands of years, after the most active short half-life <b>radioisotopes</b> decayed, burying U.S. nuclear waste would increase the radioactivity in the top 2000 feet of rock and soil in the United States (10 million km2) by ≈ 1 part in 10 million over the cumulative amount of natural <b>radioisotopes</b> in such a volume, although {{the vicinity of the}} site would have a far higher concentration of artificial <b>radioisotopes</b> underground than such an average.|$|R
40|$|The {{accelerator}} {{production of}} tritium (APT) facility, with its high beam current and high beam energy, {{would be an}} ideal supplier of <b>radioisotopes</b> for medical research, imaging, and therapy. By-product <b>radioisotopes</b> will be produced in the APT window and target cooling systems and in the tungsten target through spallation, neutron, and proton interactions. High intensity proton fluxes are potentially available at three different energies {{for the production of}} proton- rich <b>radioisotopes.</b> Isotope production targets can be inserted into the blanket for production of neutron-rich isotopes. Currently, the major production sources of <b>radioisotopes</b> are either aging or abroad, or both. The use of radionuclides in nuclear medicine is growing and changing, both {{in terms of the number}} of nuclear medicine procedures being performed and in the rapidly expanding range of procedures and <b>radioisotopes</b> used.

5|$|In total, 43 lead {{isotopes}} {{have been}} synthesized, with mass numbers 178–220. Lead-205 {{is the most}} stable <b>radioisotope,</b> with a half-life of around 1.5years.

5|$|Thallium has 25 {{isotopes}} {{which have}} atomic masses {{that range from}} 184 to 210. 203Tl and 205Tl are the only stable isotopes and make up nearly all of natural thallium. 204Tl is the most stable <b>radioisotope,</b> with a half-life of 3.78 years. It is made by the neutron activation of stable thallium in a nuclear reactor. The most useful <b>radioisotope,</b> 201Tl (half-life 73 hours), decays by electron capture, emitting X-rays (~70–80keV), and photons of 135 and 167keV in 10% total abundance; therefore, it has good imaging characteristics without excessive patient radiation dose. It {{is the most popular}} isotope used for thallium nuclear cardiac stress tests.|$|E
40|$|Storage {{phosphor}} imaging may be {{of value}} for biodistribution studies of short-living radiotracers in small animals. Efficiency, sensitivity and resolution of imaging plates for short-living <b>radioisotopes</b> vary considerably but linear response to many <b>radioisotopes</b> was shown previously. However, these properties have not been compared directly for larger series of short-living <b>radioisotopes,</b> and only few studies have directly compared data obtained from phosphor images of tissue slices with results from dissection biodistribution studies. Therefore, we evaluated the properties of imaging plates for 11 short-living <b>radioisotopes</b> (18 F, 32 P, 67 Ga, 89 Sr, (99 m) Tc, 90 Y, 111 In, 123 I, 125 I, 131 I and 201 Tl). We also evaluated the biodistribution of [123 I]FP-CIT in rat brain using both the phosphor technique and conventional dissection methods. The imaging system showed a linear response for all tested <b>radioisotopes</b> {{over a wide range}} of radioactive concentrations and the efficiency, sensitivity and resolution varied greatly for the tested <b>radioisotopes.</b> Shielding experiments revealed the contribution of the various emission products of <b>radioisotopes</b> to these properties. However, quantitative biodistribution studies with radiotracers that are labeled with all tested <b>radioisotopes,</b> even 123 I, are feasible. The results from the ex vivo biodistribution study, using [123 I]FP-CIT as a radiotracer were similar for the phosphor imaging technique as compared to the dissection technique. Advantages of phosphor imaging in radiotracer distribution studies in rat brain as compared to dissection experiments may be more precise measurements, possibility to reanalyze imaging data and 3 D-reconstruction. In conclusion, phosphor imaging is an attractive alternative for biodistribution studies of short-living radiotracers in small animal...|$|R
50|$|When alpha {{particle}} emitting isotopes are ingested, {{they are far}} more dangerous than their half-life or decay rate would suggest.

Ingested alpha emitter <b>radioisotopes</b> such as transuranics or actinides are an average of about 20 times more dangerous, and in some experiments up to 1000 times more dangerous than an equivalent activity of beta emitting or gamma emitting <b>radioisotopes.</b>|$|R

5|$|Brachytherapy {{contrasts}} with unsealed source radiotherapy, {{in which a}} therapeutic radionuclide (<b>radioisotope)</b> is injected into the body to chemically localize to the tissue requiring destruction. It also contrasts to EBRT, in which high-energy x-rays (or occasionally gamma-rays from a <b>radioisotope</b> like cobalt-60) are directed at the tumour from outside the body. Brachytherapy instead involves the precise placement of short-range radiation-sources (radioisotopes) directly {{at the site of}} the cancerous tumour. These are enclosed in a protective capsule or wire, which allows the ionizing radiation to escape to treat and kill surrounding tissue but prevents the charge of <b>radioisotope</b> from moving or dissolving in body fluids. The capsule may be removed later, or (with some radioisotopes) it may be allowed to remain in place. A feature of brachytherapy is that the irradiation affects only a very localized area around the radiation sources. Exposure to radiation of healthy tissues farther away from the sources is therefore reduced. In addition, if the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body during treatment, the radiation sources retain their correct position in relation to the tumour. These characteristics of brachytherapy provide advantages over EBRT – the tumour can be treated with very high doses of localised radiation whilst reducing the probability of unnecessary damage to surrounding healthy tissues.|$|E
