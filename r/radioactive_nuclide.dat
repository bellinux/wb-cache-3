5000|$|While {{the moment}} in time at which a {{particular}} nucleus decays is unpredictable, a collection of atoms of a <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclide</b> decays exponentially at a rate described by a parameter known as the half-life, usually given in units of years when discussing dating techniques. After one half-life has elapsed, {{one half of the}} atoms of the nuclide in question will have decayed into a [...] "daughter" [...] nuclide or decay product. In many cases, the daughter nuclide itself is radioactive, resulting in a decay chain, eventually ending with the formation of a stable (nonradioactive) daughter nuclide; each step in such a chain is characterized by a distinct half-life. In these cases, usually the half-life of interest in radiometric dating is the longest one in the chain, which is the rate-limiting factor in the ultimate transformation of the <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclide</b> into its stable daughter. Isotopic systems that have been exploited for radiometric dating have half-lives ranging from only about 10 years (e.g., tritium) to over 100 billion years (e.g., samarium-147).|$|E
50|$|The {{biological}} half-life or terminal half-life of a substance {{is the time}} it takes for a substance (for example a metabolite, drug, signalling molecule, <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclide,</b> or other substance) to lose half of its pharmacologic, physiologic, or radiologic activity. Typically, this refers to the body's cleansing through the function of kidneys and liver in addition to excretion functions to eliminate a substance from the body. In a medical context, half-life may also describe {{the time it takes}} for the blood plasma concentration of a substance to halve (plasma half-life) its steady-state. The relationship between the biological and plasma half-lives of a substance can be complex depending on the substance in question, due to factors including accumulation in tissues (protein binding), active metabolites, and receptor interactions.|$|E

The review is followed by a commentary from {{a former member of the}} International Commission on Radiological Protection, providing the reader with easily understandable information about the concept of radiation dosage. In the main part of the book, a series of scientific reports presents valuable data on the radiation surveys of the environment, environmental radioactivity, transfer models and parameters of <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclides</b> and dose assessment among residents. These reports present a wide range of findings from the research carried out in a variety of activities by large governmental organizations as well as by small private groups and individuals. The reader thus will find a large collection of valuable and interesting data related to the environmental contamination by <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclides</b> after the Fukushima accident.

In total 10, 915 soil samples were collected at 2168 locations. Gamma rays emitted from the samples were measured by Ge detectors and analyzed using a reliable unified method. The determined radioactivity was corrected to that of June 14, 2011 by considering the intrinsic decay constant of each nuclide. Finally the deposition maps were created for 134 Cs, 137 Cs, 131 I, 129 mTe and 110 mAg. The radioactivity ratio of 134 Cs– 137 Cs was almost constant at 0. 91 regardless of the locations of soil sampling. The radioactivity ratios of 131 I and 129 mTe– 137 Cs were relatively high in the regions south of the Fukushima NPP site. Effective doses for 50  y after the accident were evaluated for external and inhalation exposures due to the observed <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclides.</b> The radiation doses from radioactive cesium were found to be much higher than those from the other <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclides...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{timing of}} their {{formation}} determines which nuclides formed by cosmic ray spallation are termed primordial {{and which are}} termed cosmogenic (a nuclide cannot belong to both classes). Certain stable nuclides of lithium, beryllium, and boron found on Earth {{are thought to have}} been produced by cosmic ray spallation predominantly before the solar system's formation (thus making these primordial nuclides, by definition) are not termed [...] "cosmogenic," [...] even though they were formed by the same process as the cosmogenic nuclides (although at an earlier time). In contrast, the <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclide</b> beryllium-7 falls into this light element range, but this nuclide has a half-life too short for it to have been formed before the formation of the solar system, so that it cannot be a primordial nuclide. Since the cosmic ray spallation route is the most likely source of beryllium-7 in the environment, it is therefore cosmogenic.|$|E
50|$|Anderson {{was born}} in New York City, the son of Swedish immigrants. He studied physics and {{engineering}} at Caltech (B.S., 1927; Ph.D., 1930). Under the supervision of Robert A. Millikan, he began investigations into cosmic rays {{during the course of}} which he encountered unexpected particle tracks in his (modern versions now commonly referred to as an Anderson) cloud chamber photographs that he correctly interpreted as having been created by a particle with the same mass as the electron, but with opposite electrical charge. This discovery, announced in 1932 and later confirmed by others, validated Paul Dirac's theoretical prediction of the existence of the positron. Anderson first detected the particles in cosmic rays. He then produced more conclusive proof by shooting gamma rays produced by the natural <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclide</b> ThC (208Tl) into other materials, resulting in the creation of positron-electron pairs. For this work, Anderson shared the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics with Victor Hess.|$|E
50|$|According to the Big Bang theory, stable {{isotopes}} of {{the lightest}} five elements (H, He, and traces of Li, Be, and B) were produced very {{shortly after the}} emergence of the universe, in a process called Big Bang nucleosynthesis. These lightest stable nuclides (including deuterium) survive to today, but any radioactive isotopes of the light elements produced in the Big Bang (such as tritium) have long since decayed. Isotopes of elements heavier than boron were not produced at all in the Big Bang, and these first five elements do not have any long-lived radioisotopes. Thus, all radioactive nuclei are, therefore, relatively young with respect to the birth of the universe, having formed later in various other types of nucleosynthesis in stars (in particular, supernovae), and also during ongoing interactions between stable isotopes and energetic particles. For example, carbon-14, a <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclide</b> with a half-life of only 5,730 years, is constantly produced in Earth's upper atmosphere due to interactions between cosmic rays and nitrogen.|$|E

50|$|A {{radionuclide}} (<b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclide,</b> radioisotope or radioactive isotope) is an atom {{that has}} excess nuclear energy, making it unstable. This excess energy {{can be either}} emitted from the nucleus as gamma radiation, or create and emit from the nucleus a new particle (alpha particle or beta particle), or transfer this excess energy to one of its electrons, causing that electron to be ejected as a conversion electron. During those processes, the radionuclide is said to undergo radioactive decay. These emissions constitute ionizing radiation. The unstable nucleus is more stable following the emission, but will sometimes undergo further decay. Radioactive decay is a random process {{at the level of}} single atoms: it is impossible to predict when one particular atom will decay. However, for a collection of atoms of a single element the decay rate, and thus the half-life (t1/2) for that collection can be calculated from their measured decay constants. The range of the half-lives of radioactive atoms have no known limits and span a time range of over 55 orders of magnitude.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} predict the {{consequences}} of an accidental release of radioactive nuclides relies mainly {{on the level of}} understanding of the mechanisms involved in radioactive nuclides interactions with different components of agricultural and natural ecosystems and their formalisation into predictive models. Numerous studies and databases about contaminated agricultural and natural areas have been obtained but their use to enhance our prediction ability has been largely limited by their unresolved variability. Such variability seems to stem from an incomplete knowledge about <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclide</b> interactions with the soil matrix, soil moisture, biological elements in the soil and additional pollutants, which may be found in such soils. In this project, we investigate mainly the role of the biological elements (plants, mycorrhiza, microbes) in: <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclide</b> sorption/desorption in soils and <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclide</b> uptake/re lease by plants. Because {{of the importance of the}} chemical nature of the involved radioactive nuclides, we will follow the bioavailability of three radioactive nuclides: caesium, strontium, and technetium. The role of additional non-radioactive pollutants will also be scrutinised as they may interfere with the mechanisms governing <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclide</b> transfer to plants. Knowledge acquired from the experiments will be incorporated into two mechanistic models BIOPHAST and BIORUR specifically modelling <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclide</b> sorption/desorption from soil matrices and <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclide</b> uptake by/release from plants. These mechanistic models will be incorporated into assessment models to enhance their prediction ability.

40|$|An {{exposure}} age for an iron meteorite can {{be calculated}} from measurements of a <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclide</b> and a stable nuclide that are produced by similar sets of nuclear reactions, provided that the stable nuclide is present with low initial abundance. The standard methods rely on either K- 40 (t(sub 1 / 2) = 1. 26 Gy), K- 39, and K- 41 or on a shorter-lived radionuclide and a stable, noble gas isotope. Widely used pairs of this type include Cl- 36 /Ar- 36 and Al- 26 /Ne- 21. Other pairs that may serve the purpose for iron meteorites contain many stable isotopes besides those of K and the noble gases that are produced partly by cosmic rays. We consider here the calculation of exposure ages, t(sub 26), from measurements of Al- 26 (t(sub 1 / 2) = 0. 7 My) and (stable) Mg- 26. Ages based on Al- 26 /Mg- 26 ratios, like those based on Cl- 36 /Ar- 36 ratios, are 'buffered' against changes in relative production rates due to shielding because decay of the <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclide</b> accounts for {{a good part of}} the inventory of the stable nuclide...|$|E

The distribution coefficient which arises due to ion interactions with the membrane material and the electric potential jump at the membrane interface are included as boundary conditions in solving the equation.
