30|$|In China, the {{development}} of <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicles started late. In 1975, China’s first electromagnetically guided three-wheeled <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicle was successfully developed at the Beijing Crane Transportation Machinery Research Institute [14]. In the late 1980 s, the Beijing Machinery Industry Automation Research Institute developed the first <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicle {{that can be used}} in the three-dimensional warehouse and successfully applied in the Second Automobile Group. During the same period, the Beijing Postal Research Institute also successfully developed the Automated Guided Car IV [15] using two-way wireless communication technology. In the 1990 s, China’s research on <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicles entered a period of <b>rapid</b> development. The <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicle imported from abroad was successfully applied to the CIMS experimental research at the National CIMS Engineering Center of Tsinghua University. Shenyang Institute of Automation developed an <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicle for automobile engine assembly for Jinbei Automobile Co., Ltd., which is a successful application in China’s automobile industry [16]. Kunming Marine Equipment Research Institute successfully developed an <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicle based on laser/infrared guidance for the first time. The Intelligent Vehicles Group of Jilin University is mainly engaged in the research of <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicles based on visual navigation. It has developed JUTIV 1 and JUTIV 2 visual navigation vehicles. On this basis, they developed the JUTIV 3, general-purpose and assembly-type visual navigation <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicles for the actual application of the factory [17].|$|R
30|$|In {{the late}} 1950 s, <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> {{vehicles}} {{began to be}} used in warehouse automation and factory operations, and Japan began to introduce <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicle technology from then on. In the mid- 1970 s, due to the application of integrated circuit technology and electronic technology in <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicles, the <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicles were significantly improved in terms of automation and control performance. The <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicle entered the production system as a production component and has also been rapidly developed [1]. During this period, European companies standardized the size and structure of pallets for containers, which accelerated the development of automated transport technology in Europe [2]. The first International Conference on Unmanned Pallets was held in June 1981 in London, England, which has shown a breakthrough in the technology of <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicles [3]. In 1984, General Motors first tried an automated transport vehicle on their flexible assembly system. Two years later, the number of <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicles increased to 1407, making it the world’s largest <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicle user [4]. In 1985, due to the development of computer microprocessors and the rise of control technology, computer communication and identification technology entered the field of <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicles, and <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicles developed toward intelligence [5]. In 1987, it was reported that Sweden first used <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicles in the field of logistics systems in 1969 [6]. In 1974, the Swedish Volvo Car Company applied <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicles to their car assembly lines. This improvement has been a huge success, not only reducing labor, assembly time, and assembly failures, but also speeding up capital flow by 43 % [7]. Many Western European countries have followed suit because of the practical economic benefits of this application. In the 1980 s, the wave of <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicles in Europe flooded into the US market. Many US companies transferred advanced automatic guided trolley technology to Metron through technology introduction and joint ventures ([8]. In 1978, a direct computer-controlled automated transport vehicle system introduced from Europe was successfully applied at the Keebler Distribution Center in Chicago, USA [9]. In 1981, John Corporation of the USA applied automated transport vehicles to automated warehouses to increase the efficiency of material handling during manufacturing, and the entire process was monitored in real time [10]. The French outdoor guide automatic transporter runs at speeds of up to 97 [*]km/h [11]. In the following 10 [*]years, various intelligent <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicles have emerged in an endless stream. The <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicles based on visual navigation have also been greatly developed. At this time, the typical visual navigation system mainly includes ARCADE system of the University of Michigan; LANA system [12]; NAVLAB system of Carnegie Mellon University, USA; EMS, Vision system of German Federal University of Defense; ROMA system of IITB of Germany; and PVS system of MITI of Japan. According to statistics, by 2004, there were more than 16, 000 <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicle systems in use worldwide and more than 100, 000 <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicles [13].|$|R
30|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the path of}} port logistics transport vehicles and studies several key technologies of the new visual navigation <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicles. Combining the actual needs of current port logistics and the visual navigation in this paper, this study adopts monocular vision for logistics vehicle guidance, comparatively studies the mathematical models established by past scholars, and establishes a simplified mathematical model of <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicles. In the fourth chapter, in the research of the extraction of path information, an algorithm for extracting {{the position of the}} centerline from a path with a certain width is proposed innovatively, and good results have been obtained through experiments. In addition, this study established the controller model of the <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicle and built the model under Simulink in Matlab to simulate the <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicle to track the circular trajectory to run, analyze the error, and verify the effectiveness of the method. Finally, we carried out the actual performance test on an <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicle of the project team and tested the performance of speed, precision, and motor running respectively.

30|$|Due to {{the large}} number of goods in the port area, the {{logistics}} path is complex, and the climate inside the port area is relatively humid and there are many water vapors, the logistics path will be seriously affected, and the logistics and transportation will often be confused.

40|$|A strong {{comorbidity}} occurs between dyslexia and Specific Language Impairments (SLI) (12, 5 % - 85 %). As a {{cause of}} dyslexia, phonological problems and problems with <b>rapid</b> <b>automatic</b> naming are often mentioned. The phonological problems {{may be caused by}} an auditory processing deficit. If phonological problems and <b>rapid</b> <b>automatic</b> naming problems co-occur, the child is said to have a ‘double deficit’ and the dyslexia is more severe. Children with SLI can have multiple oral language problems, such as difficulties with language comprehension, vocabulary, word finding, morphosyntaxis, phonology and pragmatics. Depending on the combination of problems, different profiles of SLI can be distinguished. The aim of the present study is to define which SLI profile predicts the development of dyslexia. Therefore, a longitudinal study was undertaken in which two groups will be tested from third year of kindergarten until second year of primary school. In the third year of kindergarten, a group of 26 children with SLI and a group of 26 children without language and articulation problems from the same class were selected. The children of both groups were individually matched for age, non-verbal intelligence and educational level of the parents. After this selection, a large test battery was performed, including different tests for language and articulation, phonological awareness, verbal short term memory, <b>rapid</b> <b>automatic</b> naming and letter knowledge. From the results of the third year of kindergarten, it can be concluded that the children with SLI have a significantly lower score on the tests for language, articulation, phonological awareness and verbal short term memory. Only for the tests of <b>rapid</b> <b>automatic</b> naming, the differences between both groups were not significant. This may imply that children with SLI have a higher risk to develop dyslexia because of problems with oral language, articulation, phonological awareness and verbal short term memory. However, considering the results of <b>rapid</b> <b>automatic</b> naming tests, they may not have a higher risk for the ‘double deficit’. In a later stadium of this study, these results will be related to the reading and writing results from the first and second year of primary school. From this comparison, a better definition of predictors of dyslexia in children with SLI may be formulated. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|It {{has become}} widely {{accepted}} that {{the direction of}} another individual’s eye gaze induces <b>rapid,</b> <b>automatic,</b> attentional orienting, due to it being such a vital cue as to where in our environment we should attend. This automatic orienting has also {{been associated with the}} directional-arrow cues used in studies of spatial attention. Here, we present evidence that the response-time cueing effects reported for spatially nonpredictive gaze and arrow cues are not the result of <b>rapid,</b> <b>automatic</b> shifts of attention. For both cue types, response-time effects were observed only for long- duration cue and target stimuli that overlapped temporally, were largest when the cues were presented simultaneously with the response-relevant target, and were driven by a slowing of responses for invalidly cued targets rather than speeding for validly cued ones. These results argue against automatic attention-orienting accounts and support a novel spatial-incongruency explanation for a whole class of rapid behavioural cueing effects...|$|R

30|$|When Vr[*]=[*]Vl, R[*]=[*]∞, Vn[*]=[*]Vr[*]=[*]Vl, which {{indicates}} that the <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicle performs linear translation motion at this time. When Vr[*]≠[*]Vl, Rϵ(0,[*]∞), {{which indicates}} that the <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicle performs circular motion with R as the radius of rotation. In short, the camera plays a role as a projector. This transformation can be represented by orthogonal transformation or geometric perspective transformation. The model of orthogonal transformation is a model in which {{the appearance of the}} imaging plane does not change with the positional change of the camera in the environment, and the geometric perspective model changes according to the position change of the camera. In the case of <b>automatic</b> <b>transport</b> vehicles, the imaging model is often represented by a geometric model. The image information includes not only the path, but also the environment and noise interference. The purpose of preprocessing is to remove various noise interferences, distinguish the environment from the path, and identify the path. After image pre-processing, the path is basically separated from the environment, and the path is the area between two lines with a certain width. In order to more easily extract the positional deviation and angular deviation of the path, the centerline position of the path is fitted to a straight line in this design, and its width is ignored. Using this line as the standard of the path, it is more accurate and convenient to obtain the deviation value.|$|R

40|$|Pseudoword (non-word) reading {{tasks are}} a {{commonly}} used measure of phonological processing across diverse fields of reading research. However, whether pseudoword reading gives any {{more information about}} phonological processing in young learner readers than does the reading of real words has seldom been considered. Here we show that pseudoword and real word reading are so strongly correlated (r= 0. 94) in the first 4 years of school as to {{be representative of the}} same construct. Two of the subskills of phonological processing, phonological awareness and <b>rapid</b> <b>automatic</b> naming also predict almost identical amounts of variance in pseudoword and real word reading. A divergence in the correlations between word and pseudoword reading and phonological awareness and rapid naming only emerges in the fourth year, while a significant correlation between phonological awareness and <b>rapid</b> <b>automatic</b> naming is evident only {{in the first year of}} schooling.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} phonological awareness, phonological memory and <b>rapid</b> <b>automatic</b> naming abilities of adults who stutter and typically fluent peers. Many theorists posit that a delay or breakdown occurs during “phonological encoding,” or the retrieval or construction of phonological segments (Howell & Au-Yeung, 2002; Perkins, Kent & Curlee, 1991; Postma & Kolk, 1993; Wingate 1988). Efficient phonological encoding is predicated upon {{the ability to}} segment phonological representations in a rapid, precise manner. According to current theories, a delay or incomplete retrieval of lexical segments could impede {{the execution of the}} articulatory plan, thereby resulting in disfluent speech. Unfortunately, the process of phonological encoding is not directly observable and must therefore be explored though alternate processes that reflects its incremental nature. Phonological awareness, phonological memory and <b>rapid</b> <b>automatic</b> naming can be examined to accomplish this task. Several core mechanisms are utilized during phonological processing, and a deficit in any of these mechanisms could account for performance differences in phonological processing tasks. Completion of these tasks is dependent upon the quality of phonological representations in the lexicon, the ability to construct novel phonological codes online, and the ability to maintain phonological representations in memory. The process of redintegration, whereby pre-existing lexical-semantic knowledge is used to supplement decaying or delayed phonological code (Hulme et al., 1997), can also {{play an important role in}} the completion of phonological processing tasks. Participants completed several tasks examining different aspects of their phonological processing abilities. Significant between-group differences were revealed on nonlexical phonological awareness tasks, nonword repetition tasks, and <b>rapid</b> <b>automatic</b> naming tasks that used lexical stimuli. Adults who stutter performed significantly less well than typically fluent adults on tasks that used nonlexical stimuli. Adults who stutter appear to rely heavily on lexical-semantic information (redintegration) to bolster lower performance in other aspects of phonological encoding. Participants in both groups performed equally well on tasks that used lexical stimuli but not on tasks with nonlexical stimuli, indicating that between-group differences in phonological encoding exist. Differences in core mechanisms of phonological processing may reveal subtle linguistic differences that may contribute to an unstable speech system in people who stutter. ...|$|R
