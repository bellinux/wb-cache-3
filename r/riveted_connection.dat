Their fatigue resistance represents one of the most determining factors on decision making process oriented to possibility of their further exploitation after finishing their planned service life.

In a structure, a joint is {{considered}} as the weakest part, {{and it should}} not get separated when subjected to loading, so that an unstable collapse of structure can be avoided. It is important to investigate the failure in joint before it is used in a structure. Failure of a joint depends on {{various factors such as}} the geometry of joint configuration, sheet strength that are joined, rivet material used, cracks developed during joining, and many other. Self-Piercing riveting process is a new technology for joining sheet metals in automobile and aircraft industries. This process has many advantages over conventional joining processes. In this thesis, the failure of a self-piercing riveted joint is investigated. Failure of three different riveted configurations under 35 m/s and 60 m/s velocities were predicted using the general purpose non-linear finite element software LS-DYNA. This research is divided into three stages of work. In the first stage, a 2 D simulation of riveting process is carried out over two Aluminum sheets. An r-adaptive methodology is utilized to acquire a higher accuracy of results and to avoid high element distortion. A parametrical study is then conducted to study the effect of rivet penetration velocity and adaptive mesh size varies the quality of the joint. In the second stage of work, a spring back analysis of joint is conducted to study the deformations of work piece after the riveting process. In the third stage, a Peel specimen, a U-shaped single <b>riveted</b> <b>connection,</b> and a U-shaped double <b>riveted</b> <b>connection</b> were investigated for failure under 35 m/s and 60 m/s velocities in both shear and tension testing conditions.

The study revealed a direct relationship between the hole quality and the trigger force.

40|$|AbstractThe {{cumulative}} concept {{proposed by}} Palmgren and Miner [1] {{maintains that the}} damage level can be {{expressed in terms of}} the number of cycles applied at a given stress range divided by the number of cycles needed to produce failure for the same stress range. Failure occurs when the summation of these damage increments at several stress ranges becomes unity. After this formulation, this rule is repeatedly tested for different materials under multi-step and variable amplitude loading programs [2]. Though its applicability has been often questioned, it has been practically adopted by all design codes related to structural and mechanical fatigue design.

40|$|Hot-driven rivets were {{extensively}} used in {{iron and}} steel structures in the past. Nowadays, these constructions represent {{an important part of}} the architectural and cultural heritage that needs to be preserved and protected. The majority of historic steel structures is still in service and is exposed to loads larger than expected. The reliability of these structures is also affected by deterioration and the poor quality of material (Sustainable bridges 2006). After several decades from their erection, this class of constructions reveals some damages and/or structural inadequacies (Guerrieri et al. 2005). These types of constructions are generally characterized by trussed structural schemes. Hence, the failure of connections can produce the overall failure of the structure, because the <b>riveted</b> <b>connections</b> represent the weaker elements of these structures. These considerations lead to identify the vulnerability of connections as the crucial aspect concerning the structural capacity of ancient metal structures. Hence, the present work is devoted to investigate the structural capacity of lapped <b>riveted</b> <b>connections</b> loaded in shear typically adopted in aged metal structures still in service. The aim is the development of a valid methodology of prevision of the existing <b>riveted</b> <b>connections</b> behaviour. After a preliminary study on the technology of <b>riveted</b> <b>connections</b> and the <b>rivet</b> forming process, and in particular on the effects of hot driven process on the overall behaviour, a review of the actual codes prescriptions is reported, highlighting the approximations in the prescribed verifications and providing to a description of the local phenomena that characterizes the connection behaviour. An overview on the prior research on <b>riveted</b> <b>connections</b> is also presented, in which the experimental studies and the numerical simulations proposed and studied up to today are discussed and described. The literature experimental and numerical studies on <b>riveted</b> <b>connections</b> need to be extended to different materials, geometries and configurations, due to the sensitivity of the connection response to the manufacturing process (Hechtman, 1948; Schenker et al., 1954, Munse, 1970). To this end, a large experimental investigation carried out within the framework of the European project PROHITECH. A detailed description of this campaign is reported: after a detailed illustration of the set-up of experimental tests and of the monitored parameters, the results are presented and discussed. On the basis of a careful revision of results, in the final part of the chapter a theoretical formulation on the failure verifications of these connections is proposed, by revising the EN 1993 1 - 8 2005 formula. On the basis of the experimental results, a highly detailed <b>riveted</b> <b>connections</b> F. E. model is proposed.

The test joint configurations were designed to exhibit rivet fail-uressome combination of rivet yield and bearing defor-mation in the compositeas opposed to wood failure modes, such as block-shear tear-out or splitting. Results suggest that per-rivet design values should fall be-tween 1 and 2 kN, depending on species and density of the composite and load direction with respect to grain of the composite strands. Timber rivets performed better in LSL than in PSL and better in yellow poplar PSL than in Doug-las-fir or Southern Pine PSL; 40 -mm rivets in yellow poplar LSL gave roughly equivalent performance to 65 -mm rivets in yellow poplar PSL.

40|$|AbstractFatigue {{resistance}} of riveted steel railway bridges, {{built in the}} late 19 th century and {{the first half of}} the 20 th century, represents one of the problems affecting their remaining lifetime. The connection of riveted stringer to crossbeam of steel railway bridges with open decks represents a typical fatigue prone detail of these bridges. This structural detail is characterized by the frequent occurrence of fatigue cracks in the stringer web. The standard fatigue assessment method according to Eurocode EN 1993 - 1 - 9 is based on categorization of the structural details. When the detail category is known, the fatigue assessment may be done using the appropriate S-N curve, which relates the fatigue life of the detail to the stress range caused by variable load. However, the categorization of riveted details in the standard mentioned above is not sufficient for practical fatigue assessment. In order to define the fatigue category of this detail more properly, the laboratory tests on specially adapted specimens were performed.

The experimental programme {{was focused on the}} influence of important model parameters such as thickness of the plates, geometry of the specimens, material properties of the plates and loading conditions. An accurate 3 D numerical model of different types of riveted connections subjected to various loading conditions was generated {{based on the results of}} the numerical simulation of the riveting process. A new algorithm was generated in order to transfer all the information from the 2 D numerical model of the riveting process to the 3 D numerical model of the connection. Thus, the 3 D model was initialized with the proper deformed shape and the current post-riveting stress–strain state. The residual stresses and the local changes in material properties due to the riveting process were an important factor in order to get the correct structural behaviour of the model. The simulations have been carried out using the explicit finite element code LS-DYNA. The model was validated against the experimental results in order to get the correct deformation modes and the force–displacement characteristics. The numerical force–displacement curves fitted the experimental ones with reasonable accuracy. Furthermore, the model seemed to be able to describe the correct structural behaviour and thus the failure mechanisms of the self-piercing riveted connections...|$|E
40|$|The present {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the behaviour and modelling of self-piercing riveted connections using aluminium rivets. The objective has been to establish a database on the behaviour of self-piercing riveted connections using aluminium rivets with respect to the riveting process, the mechanical behaviour of single riveted connections and the structural behaviour of riveted joints. The objective has been met by a combination of laboratory tests, modelling and non-linear finite element numerical simulations. The thesis consists of four parts, i. e. four independent journal articles. Two articles have been published and two articles are submitted for journal publication. The four parts are introduced by a synopsis, comprising a brief introduction to the problem and motivations for using aluminium rivets, as well as a summary of the main findings and conclusions. Part I presents an initial study on the joining of two aluminium plates in alloy AA 6060 in three tempers W, T 4 and T 6 by using aluminium rivets in alloys, i. e. AA 6068 -T 6, AA 7108 -T 5, and AA 7278 -T 6. Tests have been carried out to understand the behaviour of the aluminium rivets during the self-piercing riveting process. Various defects in the aluminium rivets when joining were detected, e. g. rivet compression and rivet fracture. These defects were avoided by heating the plates to be joined into W temper. The mechanical strength of riveted connections using aluminium rivets was then tested under different loading conditions, and compared with that of a steel <b>riveted</b> <b>connection.</b> The data from the riveting process tests was used to validate a 2 D-axisymmetric model generated in the finite element code LSDYNA for modelling the riveting process by using aluminium rivets. The model was able to capture with reasonable accuracy the overall deformation mode of the <b>riveted</b> <b>connection</b> as well as the force evolution during the riveting process. However, the model was not able to capture the fracture in the rivet since no failure criterion was considered for the aluminium rivets. The main objective of Part II is to propose an adequate failure criterion which is able to predict the initiation of the rivet fracture during the riveting process. Here, a damage-based failure criterion, which was originally proposed by Lemaitre (1992), was chosen. A rivet compression test was proposed to better understand the behaviour of the rivet under compressive stresses. A simple calibration procedure for the failure model parameters was proposed based on inverse modelling of two tests, i. e. rivet compression test and uniaxial tension test. It was found that the model was able to predict the failure in the rivet when used for joining two plate materials with an appropriate friction value and rivet mesh size. Part III evaluates how the riveting process and the subsequent natural aging of the plates to be joined influenced the final mechanical performance of a riveted joint using an aluminium rivet. Two U-shaped specimens in alloy AA 6063 -W, obtained by a solution heattreatment of the alloy in temper T 4, were joined using an aluminium self-pierce rivet in alloy AA 7278 -T 6. The mechanical behaviour was tested after 3 and 30 days of natural aging of these riveted connections. In order to evaluate the process effect on the mechanical properties of the <b>riveted</b> <b>connection,</b> a comprehensive material test programme was carried out. Test results revealed that there is an interaction between the pre-straining and natural aging which lowers the material properties in terms of the flow stress compared to the „virgin‟ material, i. e. the curve obtained after heat treatment and aging only. The process effect on the mechanical behaviour of the riveted connections was investigated more closely by using a 3 D-numerical model. Numerical analyses showed that this lowering effect lowered the force level of the riveted joints by approximately 10 %. Part IV presents a study with the structural behaviour of self-piercing riveted joints based on aluminium and steel rivets respectively. Two T-components made of two open aluminium profiles in alloy AA 6063 temper T 4 joined by 6 and 12 rivets, respectively, were designed and tested under quasi-static loading conditions. A new test device was developed to perform the tests of the T-components under two different load cases. Experimental results of the T-components joined by using aluminium self-piercing rivets were then compared with the corresponding components joined by using steel rivets in terms of force-displacement curves, deformation modes of the components as well as rivet failure modes. The experimental results of the T-components based on aluminium rivets were used to validate a resultant-based point-connector model for self-piercing rivets proposed by Hanssen et al. (2011) using shell elements. It was found that the use of the model for predicting the structural behaviour of riveted joints based on the T-component tests by using shell elements gave acceptable results in most of the cases.

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of the self-piercing riveting (SPR) technology {{in recent years has}} broadened the application of the technology in the automobile industry. However, the SPR process currently utilises high-strength steel rivets; and the combination between steel rivets with an aluminium car body makes recycling a challenge. The possibility of replacing a steel self-piercing rivet with an aluminium one has thus been raised as an interesting topic. Within this framework, the objective of the present paper is to provide an experimental database on the riveting process using an aluminium self-piercing rivet. An experimental programme has been carried out, where two similar sheets in aluminium alloy 6060 in three different tempers (temper W, temper T 4, and temper T 6) have been joined by using a self-piercing rivet in three different alloys, i. e. 6082 -T 6, 7108 -T 5, and 7278 -T 6. The influence of the die shape on the SPR of aluminium sheets using aluminium rivets was also considered. Conventional rivets and dies according to the Boellhoff standards were employed. The test results were exploited in terms of the riveting force–displacement curves and cross-sectional geometries of the riveted joints. The test data were also used to validate a 2 D-axisymmetric model, which was originally developed at SIMLab for modelling the riveting process using a steel rivet. Finally, the mechanical behaviour of a <b>riveted</b> <b>connection</b> using an aluminium rivet under quasi-static loading conditions (i. e. combined pure shear and pure opening loads) was experimentally studied and compared with corresponding tests using a steel rivet in terms of force–displacement curves...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Current {{recommendations}} {{provided by}} the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for load rating of steel truss bridges were shown to be overly conservative in estimating the rivet capacity in shear by researchers from the University of Washington. Many steel truss bridges in place were constructed during the mid 20 th century and require such load rating to determine if retrofitting, tear down, or a live loading limit is necessary. Past research on riveted connections has not included tests on as-built riveted connections, but rather shop fabricated specimens. Therefore, an enhanced understanding of ultimate rivet shear strength in gusset plates and the relation to connection length could improve the current procedure. Experiments on secondary riveted joints with various connection lengths were tested in a Universal Testing Machine (UTM) to determine the average ultimate shear strength of the rivets. The <b>riveted</b> <b>connection</b> was assembled with supporting members to improve capacity and stability and allow for testing of longer connections through shear failure. The test setup used for this investigation placed each rivet under a uniform load. This differed from previous research performed by Fisher and Rumpf (1967) on lap splices. Their loading mechanism caused the average ultimate strength of the rivets to decrease as connection length increases, and therefore a reduction factor was recommended by AASHTO for connections greater than 50 inches. The results of this test program in combination of past research will serve as an upper and lower bound, respectively, for connection behavior. Results showed that the average ultimate rivet shear strength was not a function of connection length under the designed load mechanism. The average ultimate rivet shear strength was larger than the values used in the load rating procedure and past research. The connecting elements deformed prior to failure of the rivets, which {{is a result of}} the rivets being stronger than the nominal values from the time of construction. This suggest that for gusset plate connections loaded in a distributed manner, that a reduction factor for ultimate rivet strength may not be needed, and there is potential that current reduction factors for longer connections could be reduced...|$|E
40|$|A large {{percentage}} of the railway bridges in the UK rail network and around Europe are of riveted construction exceeding in many cases 100 years of age. The remaining fatigue life of these bridges is difficult to estimate due to the uncertainties regarding the fatigue behaviour of wrought-iron and older steel material which were used for their construction. The problem is further compounded by the uncertainties associated with the loading both past and future. Previous global finite element analyses of a typical wrought-iron riveted railway bridge have shown that the fatigue critical details are the inner stringer-to-cross-girder connections (Imam et al. 2005). The analyses were carried out under a historical load model (Imam et al. 2005), developed to represent rail traffic in the period 1900 - 1970, and present day traffic (BS 5400 1980) for the period 1970 onwards. Deterministic remaining fatigue life estimates of the connections were found {{to be sensitive to the}} level of dynamic amplification as well as the fatigue classification of the details. Following this work, this paper presents probabilistic fatigue life estimates for the most highly damaged stringer-to-cross-girder connection, as identified by the global analysis of the riveted bridge. On the loading side, the problem is randomised through the frequency of train traffic, dynamic amplification and uncertainties regarding the difference between actual and calculated stresses. On the response side, different assumed S-N curves used for detail classification and the Miner sum are also treated as random. The probabilistic analysis, which is carried out using Monte Carlo simulation, shows that the most heavily fatigue-loaded stringer-to-cross-girder connection has considerable fatigue life reserve. Through a sensitivity study, it is found that for a 2. 3 % probability of failure, the remaining fatigue life of the investigated connection is equal to 68 years for a pessimistic scenario. Under a more realistic combination of variables (base model), the 2. 3 % characteristic remaining fatigue life is found to be 480 years. Figure 1 shows the effect of different variables on the time to attainment of a 2. 3 % probability of failure assuming a base model. It can be seen that fatigue life estimates exhibit the highest sensitivity to detail classification, in other words the constant amplitude fatigue behaviour of the detail, and the factor α, which takes into account the difference between measured and calculated stresses. In particular, by changing the detail classification from Class WI (base model), which is used to represent wrought-iron riveted details, to Class D (BS 5400 1980), which is used to represent bolted or riveted steel connections with a high clamping force, there is a 180 % increase in the time required to attain a 2. 3 % probability of fatigue failure. On the other hand, a change to a modified Class B detail, which may be thought of being representative of a <b>riveted</b> <b>connection</b> with no or low clamping force in the rivets, is found to result in a 40 % decrease in the same time. The use of a mean value of 0. 70 for the factor α is found to result in an increase in the fatigue life at the 2. 3 % failure probability by about 110 %. However, a mean value of α of 0. 90 is found to result in a decrease in this fatigue life by about 50 %. The mean values of the cumulative damage model (Δ) and the dynamic amplification factor (DAF) may be seen in Figure 1 to be of less importance. (Graph Presented). © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group...|$|E

Using FE analyses, validated through experimental comparison, the authors demonstrated the influence of the applied load typology on failure mode and on fatigue life. Nevertheless, the results are obtained by introducing multi-axial criterions, based on local stresses evaluation, reachable only with 3 D refined models; this makes the approach of difficult application in multi-riveted structures.|$|R
50|$|The semi-parabolic {{bridge is}} made of {{crucible}} steel and consists of <b>riveted</b> <b>connections,</b> stretched over the river bed in a slightly oblique position. The two parallel truss beams are divided by eleven vertical poles and rest on supports made from natural stone. The floor of the bridge, in which the former tram rails lie, is now asphalted. Only the three inner fields of the trusses are reinforced by cross-shaped struts, while the others fields have simple struts between {{the upper and lower}} straps. In course of an extension to the tram connection, the upper straps were reinforced by transverse bends to stabilize the construction.|$|R
40|$|Construction is not {{possible}} without joining single parts to components {{and at the end}} to the final structure. There exist multifarious kinds of connections whose suitability mainly depends on the characteristic of raw material the structural parts are made of. This article especially deals with joints in metallic light weight structures. Beside the typical connections in metal structures like welding, bolting and riveting in metallic light weight structures further kinds of connections can be found like standing seam, clinch, punch rivet or cartridge fired pin connections. Describing all these single methods would go {{beyond the scope of this}} article. That is why only the predominant part of all connections with so called pencil-shaped fastening elements like screwed <b>connections,</b> blind <b>riveted</b> <b>connections</b> and connections with cartridge fired pins will be dealt with. Furthermore the scope of application will be shown, advantages and disadvantages will be compared, the determination of characteristic values or resistance will be shortly explained and advices for calculation and execution will be given...|$|R
25|$|The bridges in Fulton County exhibit {{two types}} of steel truss bridge construction, Pratt bridge and Parker, which were the most common early types of steel truss bridges. Due to {{variation}} within each type of bridge, the collection in Fulton County offered {{a unique opportunity to}} view the evolution of late 19th and early 20th century steel truss bridge construction. For example, the now-demolished London Mills Bridge, a Pratt built in 1883, features pinned connection and double eyebars for the lower chord and for the diagonals. This is compared to the also destroyed Indian Ford Bridge, a Pratt bridge built in 1917, which used <b>riveted</b> <b>connections</b> and I-beam construction for its lower chords and diagonals.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a service life {{assessment}} of an aged steel riveted railway bridge is presented. Nowadays, such bridges show structural {{deficiencies in the}} <b>riveted</b> <b>connections</b> due to the increased traffic demand, the current code requirements, the deterioration due to fatigue and corrosion. To this end, a life-cycle evaluation of structural performance over time is envisaged. The assessment of fatigue capacity is carried out considering the influence of variation of stress intensity related to the thickness loss by corrosion over time. The residual service life is assessed for several design scenarios, each defined as {{a combination of the}} maintenance performed during the service life, the train loads acting on the structure and the corrosion of bridge components, taking into account the fatigue and corrosion effects...|$|R
40|$|The steel {{thin-walled}} {{structures are}} widespread in civil and industrial engineering nowadays. Self-drilling screws or rivets {{are used to}} interconnect thin-walled elements. Blind rivets and nuts as connectors are considered in the frames of this paper. Rivets have some benefits over self-drilling screws. They are: we can obtain more dense <b>connection</b> when using <b>rivets.</b> So we can increase bearing capacity of connection; a lower cost of riveted connection; a large variety of installation tools for riveted connection: manual, pneumatic, battery; side; an easy installation: access to the connected element is required only from one. These benefits provide increasingly growling popularity to rivets. In the paper 4 types of rivets are considered: combined (aluminum/steel) blind rivets, zinc-coated steel blind rivets, stainless steel blind rivets and blind nuts. The features of each type of rivets are described in the paper. The influence on the behaviour of connections is revealed. The results of experimental research performed by the authors are presented in the paper. A bearing capacity shear of <b>riveted</b> <b>connections</b> is studied in the experiment. There are 3 types of <b>riveted</b> <b>connections</b> subjected to experiment: connection made by blind combined rivets; connection made by zinc-coated steel blind rivets; connection made by blind nuts. A connection between elements with significantly different thicknesses is modeled in the experiment. In reality this situation takes place, for example, in the roofing of buildings, where trapezoidal sheet can be fastened to purlin by rivets. As {{a result of the}} experiment the authors found out that the local deformations occuring under rivet head in the thick element significantly affect the behaviour and bearing capacity of the connection. That’s why the results of connection's bearing capacity obtained in tests were lower than the bearing capacity of rivet declared by manufacturers...|$|R

Experimental specimens were manufactured with materials and techniques used in aged metal structures and different dimensions and configurations were considered. The results of the experimental investigation allowed the influence of various parameters on {{the response of the}} connections to be assessed, such as load eccentricity, variation in net area, plate width and number of rivets. The experimental results and predicted shear strengths were compared in order to evaluate the reliability of the provisions of EN 1993 : 1 - 8. On the basis of the results obtained, modifications are proposed to the design equations given by EN 1993 : 1 - 8 for the rivet shear strength and the ultimate resistance of the net cross-section...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{validate}} the use of measurement methods {{in the study of}} GFRP joints. A number of tests were carried out by means of a tensile machine. The studies were concerned with <b>rivet</b> <b>connection</b> of composite materials. One performed two series of tests for two different forces and two fibre orientations. Using Finite Element Method (FEM) and Digital Image Correlation (DIC), strain maps in the test samples were defined. The results obtained with both methods were analysed and compared. The destructive force was analysed and, {{with the use of a}} strain gauge, the clamping force in a plane parallel to the annihilated sample was estimated. Destruction processes were evaluated and models of destruction were made for this type of materials taking into account their <b>connections,</b> such as <b>riveting...</b>|$|R
40|$|Self {{piercing}} <b>riveted</b> <b>connections</b> {{are increasingly}} used in steel framed housing in Australia. It involves the joining {{of two or}} more plates by using a rivet to pierce and clinch in a single operation. In order to enhance the use of this efficient connection technology, attempts were made recently to develop a universal rivet type {{that can be used in}} most steel house frame assemblies. This required structural testing of the new rivet type in two and three plate assemblies to determine their strengths and the effects of many influential parameters such as steel thickness and grade, order of joining and the number of plates, rivet and die types. More than 150 standard lap shear tests were undertaken for this purpose. This paper presents the results from this experimental study and the results. 1...|$|R
