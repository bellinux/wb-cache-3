40|$|The {{traditional}} approach to U. S. environmental {{policy has been}} to regulate emissions to air, land and water separately. Recognizing that efforts to enforce medium-specific environmental regulations are also medium-specific, we hypothesize that the enforcement of regulations pertaining to one environment medium may cause polluters to alter their releases to other media. This dissertation examines the impacts of the enforcement of air and water regulations faced by the U. S. pulp industry on their toxic chemical <b>releases</b> <b>to</b> <b>air</b> and water pathways and the human-health risks associated with these releases. ^ The results suggest that pulp facilities respond to {{a greater number of}} inspections for compliance to air regulations by reducing their TRI emissions to water pathways. On the other hand, these firms seem to respond to a greater number of inspections for water regulation compliance and efforts taken against violators of water regulations by increasing their toxic chemical <b>releases</b> <b>to</b> <b>air</b> pathways. Using the EPA 2 ̆ 7 s Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators Model enforcement-induced cross-media transfers of human-health risks from air and water releases of toxic chemicals are also examined. This study finds that cross-media risk impacts can differ substantially from cross-media release impacts. ^ Additionally, TRI release trends and their associated human-health risks are examined for the U.

This analysis finds that while combined air and water releases did not change much during the decade, the overall risk impact of these releases declined by more than 70...|$|E

The Department of Energy (DOE) has recognized the benefits of PPOAs in the DOE Waste Minimization Pollution Prevention Crosscut Plan which states that the completion of opportunity assessments is of critical importance to DOE because they are an essential management decision-making tool that tell DOE: (1) how much waste and environmental releases can be avoided; (2) through what activity/process changes waste reduction can be achieved; (3) what it will cost to implement a pollution prevention opportunity; and (4) {{what will be the}} long-term savings in avoided waste management costs.

However, the number of sites evaluated for aluminum is not known. The frequency of these sites {{can be seen in}} Figure 6 - 1. Of these sites, 590 are located within the United States, 2 are located in Guam, 3 are located in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and 1 is located in the Virgin Islands (not shown). Aluminum is the most abundant metal and the third most abundant element in the earth’s crust, comprising about 8. 8 % by weight (88 g/kg). It is never found free in nature and is found in most rocks, particularly igneous rocks as aluminosilicate minerals (Lide 2005; Staley and Haupin 1992). Aluminum is also present in air, water, and many foods. Aluminum enters environmental media naturally through the weathering of rocks and minerals. Anthropogenic releases are in the form of air emissions, waste water effluents, and solid waste primarily associated with industrial processes, such as aluminum production. Because of its prominence as a major constituent of the earth's crust, natural weathering processes far exceed the contribution of <b>releases</b> <b>to</b> <b>air,</b> water, and land associated with human activities (Lantzy and MacKenzie 1979).

40|$|Atmospheric {{dispersion}} modelling {{can be used}} {{to estimate}} the environmental impact of <b>releases</b> <b>to</b> <b>air.</b> The {{purpose of this paper is}} determine whether the National Pollutant Inventory (NPI), Australia 2 ̆ 7 s national database of pollutant releases, can be used for atmospheric dispersion modelling and, if so, the conditions that must be satisfied for it to be used effectively. The selection of emission estimation techniques (EETs) significantly affects the reliability of reported NPI emissions. The reliability of NPI data has improved as facilities gain a better understanding of the reporting process, as Industry Handbooks are reviewed and as facilities find beneficial uses for NPI data within their organisations. Although NPI data in isolation do not satisfy dispersion modelling requirements, it is likely that the necessary supporting information relating to variation in emissions and source characteristics will be obtained or calculated by industry as part of the NPI reporting process. Regulatory authorities may be able to obtain these data through other regulatory requirements. To lessen the burden on industry in collecting the necessary supporting information for regional dispersion modelling, environmental regulatory authorities could consider the coordinated collection, storage and updating of the necessary information. Dispersion modelling using NPI data may be associated with relatively large uncertainties. However, provided that the uncertainty in NPI emissions estimates is recognised and depending on the end use of the modelling, predictions based on these data could provide the basis for effective decision makin...|$|E
