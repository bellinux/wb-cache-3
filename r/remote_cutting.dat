40|$|The <b>remote</b> <b>cutting</b> {{technique}} {{provides an}} enormous potential {{in terms of}} cutting speeds when working on thin sheets. Even on contour cutting speeds about 100 mmin are realizable. Working without any cutting gas, the material of the cutting kerf must be vaporized partially. It is evident that the energy input must be higher than for pure melting of the cutting kerf's material. In order to characterize laser cutting processes in terms of energetic efficiency, the severance energy can be used.

Of utmost importance is the high beam quality of fiber lasers which enables us {{to reduce the size of}} the focusing head incl. scanning mirrors. The excellent beam quality of the fiber laser offers a lot of new applications. In the field of <b>remote</b> <b>cutting</b> and welding the beam quality is the key parameter. By reducing the size of the focusing head including the scanning mirrors we can reach scanning frequencies up to 1. 5 kHz and in special configurations up to 4 kHz. By using these frequencies very thin and deep welding seams can be generated experienced so far with electron beam welding only. The excellen t beam quality of the fiber laser offers a high potential for developing new applications from deep penetration welding to high speed cutting. Highly dynamic cutting systems with maximum speeds up to 300 m/min and accelerations up to 4 g reduce the cutting time for cutting complex 2 D parts. However, due to the inertia of such systems the effective cutting speed is reduced in real applications. This is especially true if complex shapes or contours are cut. With the introduction of scanner-based <b>remote</b> <b>cutting</b> systems in the kilowatt range, the effective cutting speed on the contour can be dramatically increased. The presentation explains <b>remote</b> <b>cutting</b> of metal foils and sheets using high brightness single mode fiber lasers.

40|$|From {{industrial}} electrical machine production {{it is well}} known, that {{processing of}} non-oriented electrical steels causes changes in the lattice and microstructure that also affect the magnetic structure. While applying these manufacturing techniques (punching or laser fusion cutting), mechanical and thermal stresses are induced due to elastic and plastic deformation or temperature gradients within the material. For more than 15 years, fusion cutting with CO 2 -lasers enabled a flexible and wear-free production but mostly for prototypes and small batches. Ten years ago, the development of fraction limited solid-state lasers started and thus enabled laser <b>remote</b> <b>cutting.</b> Nowadays, industry demands sheet thicknesses between 0. 35 mm and 0. 5 mm {{due to the fact}} of eddy current loss reduction. Concerning this context, best choice is laser <b>remote</b> <b>cutting</b> (LRC).

40|$|Within the Collaborative Research Centre 639 the {{processing}} chain from filaments up to component parts under {{the focus of}} textile-reinforced thermoplastics is considered. Thereby, thermoplastic hybrid yarns (glass/ polypropylene filaments) are processed to multi-layer knitted fabrics and subsequently to complex spacer structures for lightweight constructions. The applications of hybrid yarns facilitate short flow paths of the matrix systems and thus comparatively low impregnation and consolidation pressures. These process conditions are beneficial for the integration of functional elements as sensors and electronic components in fibre-reinforced thermoplastic parts. Nevertheless, to minimize the strain on these elements during the pressing process, especially in thin-walled components, an adapted lay-up has to be examined. For the variation of the single layer thicknesses the material is excavated in the integration relevant area by a <b>remote</b> laser <b>cutting</b> process. Since high intensities are needed to enable laser cutting of glass-fibre textiles a brilliant laser beam source is recommended. Thereby, the remote-technology is used to deflect the beam onto the material with tiltable scanning mirrors. Furthermore, a precise positioning of the laser cutting pathis required. For this reason a camera positioning system is used to detect the working area of the scanner system. Subsequently, the certain work piece features can be extracted by image processing algorithms. The determined data {{is used for the}} cutting path generation. Since the cutting process is a thermal process, it is necessary to minimize the heat affected zone to a minimum. Therefore, a tailored <b>remote</b> laser <b>cutting</b> strategy was developed.

This investigation was conducted as an experimental study in which the angle of incidence was decomposed into a work angle and a travel angle. The stability was evaluated by an automatic procedure based on images acquired by a programmable microscope and a computer vision algorithm developed in MATLAB.

40|$|Laser cutting plays a huge role in {{the field}} of laser {{materials}} processing. An excellent beam quality, a great laser power and a high absorption rate are the most important ones in order to reach high cutting speeds in combination with high cutting edge qualities. Providing the mentioned characteristics, the fibre laser has the biggest potential. Studies at Fraunhofer IWS have shown, that cutting with fibre lasers is promising in order to reach high cutting rates and cutting edge qualities (1) (2) (3). Beam qualities below 2. 5 mm mrad at a wavelength of about 1 my m and a laser power in the area of several kW enable new possibilities in laser processing. With such characteristics it is possible to cut thin sheets with very high cutting rates. However, these cutting speeds cannot be achieved with linear drives, {{especially in the case of}} cutting contours. Thus the cutting speeds are currently limited by the dynamic of the used handling system. Cutting speeds limited by the ability of the laser are much higher. A solution to minimize this gap is described in the presented research paper. This paper describes a smart solution using the advantages of high brightness lasers - the <b>remote</b> <b>cutting.</b> Firstly a short introduction of the process is given and the experimental equipment will be explained. Disclaiming any cutting gas a nozzle is no longer necessary. Thereby the working distance does no longer depend on the distance between the nozzle and the work piece. In combination with a 2 D-Scanner the laser beam is flexible in the working field of the scanner. Afterwards a thermodynamic characterization of the <b>remote</b> <b>cutting</b> process is carried out.
