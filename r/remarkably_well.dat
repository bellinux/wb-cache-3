5|$|Following his {{discovery}} of the wreck site, Ballard returned to Titanic in July 1986 aboard the research vessel RV Atlantis II. Now the deep-diving submersible DSV Alvin could take people back to Titanic {{for the first time}} since her sinking, and the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) Jason Jr. would allow the explorers to investigate the interior of the wreck. Another system, ANGUS, was used to carry out photo surveys of the debris field. Jason Jr. descended the ruined Grand Staircase as far as B Deck, and photographed <b>remarkably</b> <b>well</b> preserved interiors, including some chandeliers still hanging from the ceilings.|$|E

Led by him, they perform <b>remarkably</b> <b>well</b> in combat, and manage to rescue Archer, Tucker, and Kessick. Enterprise then leaves orbit just as the warships arrive. Unfortunately, Kessick dies, but not before providing coordinates for the Xindi homeworld. When the ship reaches this position, there {{is nothing but a}} 100-year-old field of space debris.|$|E
5|$|The bohor reedbuck inhabits moist grasslands and swamplands {{as well as}} woodlands. It {{is found}} in two kinds of habitat in {{northern}} Cameroon: the seasonally flooded grasslands rich in grasses like Vetiveria nigritana and Echinochloa pyramidalis (in the Sahelo-Sudan region) and Isoberlina woodlands (in the Sudano-Guinean region). Often found on grasslands susceptible to floods and droughts, the bohor reedbuck can adapt <b>remarkably</b> <b>well</b> to radical seasonal changes and calamities. It is not so widespread as the bushbuck due to its habitat requirements. In some margins of its range, the bohor reedbuck shares its habitat with the mountain reedbuck. The ranges of the bohor reedbuck and southern reedbuck extensively overlap in Tanzania.|$|E
40|$|Twenty-four {{patients}} with {{urinary tract infection}} were treated by administration of doxycycline hydrochloride (Vibramycin) and the following results were obtained. Of 12 cases with chronic urinary infection or postoperative infection, 4 responded <b>remarkably,</b> 4 <b>well</b> and 4 showed no response. The effective rate was thus 66. 7 %. Of 8 cases of acute pyelonephritis, 4 responded <b>remarkably,</b> 3 <b>well</b> and one no response. The effective rate was thus 87. 5 %. Of 4 cases of acute cystitis, 3 responded <b>remarkably</b> and one <b>well.</b> The effective rate was 100 %. E. coli, Staph. epidermidis and Staph. aureus were sensitive to doxycycline hydrochloride. This fact was also proved by the clinical evidence. For {{the treatment of the}} secondary urinary tract infection, elimination of the urinary stasis IS important and the effect of the drug must be evaluated with this matter in mind. Doxycycline hydrochloride was particularly effective for acute urinary tract infection such as acute pyelonephritis and acute cystitis. This was probably due to the long duration of the effective blood concentration and high urinary excretion rate. No side effects were observed due to doxycycline hydrochloride. Finally, it was concluded that doxycycline hydrochloride (Vibramycin) is an excellent drug useful for the treatment of urinary tract infection...|$|R

5|$|Harrison and Hancock {{counties}} {{were generally}} not affected quite as severely as communities {{closer to the}} Alabama border, but the entire area still suffered extensively. In sections of Gulfport, large fires were sparked by downed power lines and fed by broken natural gas pipes. Debris on roadways prevented firefighters from reaching the fires, allowing them to spread. Similar destruction was seen to the east at Biloxi, where the hurricane's winds tore the roofs off many buildings. Beachfront communities were {{in a state of}} disarray, with large trees uprooted, debris littering the ground, and accumulations of sand on parts of roads like U.S. 90. Damage to schools in Harrison County—particularly in Gulfport and Biloxi—was extensive. Most homes in the area survived the storm, which was locally estimated to have been a once-in-50-year event, with relatively little damage. Several buildings along the coast in the Biloxi area sustained severe damage, but many of the older houses near the Gulf of Mexico there fared <b>remarkably</b> <b>well.</b> Winds brought down large highway signs, in some cases striking nearby buildings. Along the coast, Elena caused beach erosion, damaged coastal structures and recreational beach facilities, and dislocated navigational buoys and markers in various ports, several of which were closed pending Coast Guard inspection. Winds over inland Pearl River County damaged 350 permanent and mobile homes, and as in Alabama, the hurricane took a large toll on pecan and soybean crops and farms.|$|E

40|$|Hyperkinetic {{children}} {{are identified as}} a “population-at risk” upon admission to kindergarten. The etiology of hyperkinetic behavior is controversial. “Organic driveness,” “hyperkinetic behavior disorder,” “postencephalitic behavior,” “brain damage with behavioral and conceptual deficit,” “Strauss syndrome,” have all been used to label essentially similar symptom constellations. Bypassing the area of controversy, a study is reported that demonstrates that children who were identified as “hyperkinetic” (using behavioral criteria developed in an earlier study) were (1) absent from school more frequently, and (2) did <b>remarkably</b> less <b>well</b> on standardized tests of school readiness than their peers rated “nonhyperkinetic. ” The implications are discussed and suggestions made {{for the development of}} intervention programs...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} reduce {{positioning}} calculation power consumption of ZigBee module, a fingerprint positioning method was proposed in the paper based on interval-valued data fuzzy c-means algorithm. Fingerprints were regarded as interval-valued data which could reflect its uncertainty caused by measurement error and interference. In high–dimensional feature space spanned by interval midpoint and length, fingerprints were clustered by FCM algorithm to lower computation complexity. Compared with traditional clustering technologies, such as c-mean, the method got better clustering results of location fingerprints in the positioning experiment designed in the paper. Results from the clustering and positioning experiments show that the method provides a feasible solution to decrease the positioning calculation power consumption of ZigBee module <b>remarkably,</b> as <b>well</b> as ensures the positioning precision...|$|R

25|$|In {{the higher}} leagues, umpires are {{appointed}} by the local umpires association to preside over the game and receive a fee and transport allowance for their time. However, {{as the number of}} umpires available is typically considerably less than the number of games scheduled, the majority of games are played without externally appointed umpires. In this scenario, members of the batting side not currently involved in the action take it in turns to take on the umpiring responsibilities, typically in stints of 10 or 15 overs at a time. The umpires are expected to remain impartial and unbiased in their judgements, and although a small degree of bias is occasionally perceived, this arrangement functions <b>remarkably</b> <b>well.</b>|$|E

Within a week, Rubens and Kurlbaum gave a fuller report of their measurements confirming Planck's law. Their technique for spectral resolution of the longer wavelength radiation was called the residual ray method. The rays were repeatedly reflected from polished crystal surfaces, and the rays that made it {{all the way through the}} process were 'residual', and were of wavelengths preferentially reflected by crystals of suitably specific materials.|$|E
25|$|Despite Tolstoj’s great age and its embayment by {{the ancient}} inter- crater plains, it retains an {{extensive}} and <b>remarkably</b> <b>well</b> preserved, radially lineated ejecta blanket around two-thirds of its circumference. The ejecta tends to be blocky and only weakly lineated between {{the inner and outer}} rings. Radial lineations with a slight swirly pattern are best seen on the southwest side of Tolstoj. The unusual rectilinear map pattern of the ejecta suggests: (1) control of the ejecta pattern by prebasin structures, (2) preferential burial along structural trends of an originally symmetrical ejecta blanket by the intercrater plains material, or (3) formation of Tolstoj by an oblique impact from the northwest that produced an ejecta blanket with bilateral symmetry and little or no deposition uprange. Analysis of stereo- photography of Tolstoj ejecta northeast of the crater suggests that this deposit has been upwarped to a higher elevation relative to the surrounding plains.|$|E

In these animals about 2 - 3 X 10 (3) synaptic boutons were observed per square millimetre in thin sections of the ganglion; synapses were located mainly on finger-like extensions of cell bodies and on dendrites. The size of the ganglion cell population, the number of inputs per ganglion cell, the density of synaptic boutons and the amplitude of post-synaptic potentials recorded intracellularly did not differ significantly between the young and aged animals.
