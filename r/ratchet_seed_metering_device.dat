40|$|To {{increase}} mechanized cotton planting {{in areas}} with saline irrigation water and crust forming soil in Isfahan Province, assessment of seeders in flatland planting method with or without crust breaking is essential. An experiment was conducted at the Kabootarabad Research Station of Isfahan Research Center to compare the performance parameters of planting equipment in a clay loam soil. Four planting equipment treatments using Bazrsazan and John Deere planters and Nordsten drill along with three crust breaking methods, including rolling cultivator, rolling-type crust breaker and no crust breaking, were {{laid out in a}} factorial experiment within a randomized complete block design with three replications. Planters’ performance was evaluated by measuring the number of plants and plant spacings in each treatment, and estimation of the mean and standard deviation, multiples index, miss index, quality of feed index, precision, and hill-dropping index. Although the plant spacings, and not the seed spacings, were measured in this experiment, the indices used in this research showed the planters’ performance to be very satisfactory. The suggested hill-dropping index showed the multiple seeds dropping characteristics of the seeders to be better than those of the multiples index regardless of the crust breaking methods. In the non-crust breaking method, the multiple seeds dropping tendency of Bazrsazan planter brought about a reduction in the mean and standard deviation of plant spacings. Crost breaking caused a reduction in plant spacings for all seeders, especially for the drill whose multiple seeds dropping tendency was negligible. The results indicated that the <b>seed</b> <b>metering</b> systems in Bazrsazan and John Deere planters were volumetric rather than single <b>seed</b> <b>metering</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractA new {{controlled}} <b>seed</b> <b>metering</b> {{unit was}} designed and mounted on a common grain drill for direct seeding of wheat (DSW). It comprised the following main parts: (a) a variable-rate controlled direct current motor (DCM) as <b>seed</b> <b>metering</b> shaft driver, (b) two digital encoders for sensing the rotational speed of supplemental ground wheel (SGW) and <b>seed</b> <b>metering</b> shaft and (c) a control box to handle and process the data of the unit. According to the considered closed-loop control system, the designed control box regularly checked the revolution per minute (RPM) of <b>seed</b> <b>metering</b> shaft, as operation feedback, using its digital encoder output. The seeding rate was determined based on the calculated error signal and output signal of the digital encoder of the SGW. A field with four different levels of wheat stubble coverage (10 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 %) was selected for evaluation of the fabricated <b>seed</b> <b>metering</b> unit (FSMU). The dynamic tests were conducted to compare the performance of installed FSMU on the grain drill and equipped grain drill with common <b>seed</b> <b>metering</b> unit (CSMU) at three forward speeds of 4, 6 and 8 (Km/h) for DSW. Results of the FSMU assessment demonstrated that an increase in forward speed of grain drill (FSGD) and stubble coverage did not significantly affect the seeding rate in the grain drill for DSW. Using the FSMU reduced the coefficient of variation (CV) by approximately 50 %.

40|$|A punch planter was {{designed}} for no-till conditions. Initially, the penetration forces acting on two different punches were evaluated in laboratory tests with two different soils and varying soil moisture contents and bulk densities. A standard cone penetrometer {{was used as a}} reference. Soil samples were prepared using PVC molds with a procedure based on the Proctor test. Bulk density was the factor that resulted in the biggest changes in penetration force. Good correlations were observed between the cone penetrometer data and punch penetration forces. A prototype punch planter for corn {{was designed}} and built using a commercial vacuum <b>seed</b> <b>meter.</b> The <b>seed</b> <b>meter</b> was evaluated in the laboratory, vertically and inclined. The prototype planter with the <b>seed</b> <b>meter</b> attached was also evaluated in the laboratory. The results were not significantly affected by the working position of the <b>seed</b> <b>meter</b> nor by speeds between 1. 0 and 3. 0 m/s for the <b>seed</b> <b>meter</b> and planter prototype. Field tests were conducted at several residue covers at 2. 0 m/s and no significant differences in plant spacings were observed. The prototype was modified to be able to plant different population rates. Seed spacings of 136, 165 and 210 mm were obtained by constructing three punch wheels with different punch lengths. Laboratory and field tests were run at speeds of 1. 5, 2. 0 and 2. 5 m/s. The field tests were run in three different residue covers (corn, grain sorghum and soybean). Despite problems with synchronization between the <b>seed</b> <b>meter</b> and punch wheels in some combinations, the length of the punches seemed to cause no significant problems at the speeds tested. A soil cleaning device was designed to reduce the soil disturbance. The volume of soil displaced by the smallest punch wheel was less than half of that displaced by a commercial no-till planter. Planting depth regularity was evaluated, showing good uniformity. Though the results are promising, recommendations for further improvement are proposed, especially related to the synchronization between the <b>seed</b> <b>meter</b> and punch wheel. ...|$|R

A seed drill {{that can be}} drawn by the widely-available two-wheel tractor (2 WT) is an attractive option for mechanization of no-till in small-sized fields. The Versatile Strip Seed Drill (VSSD) was designed with the capacity to make up to 40 mm wide and 60 mm deep strips in untilled land along with seed and basal fertilizer application in a single-pass operation, while powered by the 8. 95 to 11. 93 kW 2 WT.

Both incessant seed dropping by fluted roller <b>seed</b> <b>meters</b> and spaced planting by vertical disk type <b>seed</b> <b>meters</b> provided optimum plant populations that were generally higher than in conventional, full-tillage plots with the same rate of hand broadcasted seed and fertilizers.
