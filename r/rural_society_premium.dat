40|$|The {{intent of}} this paper is to clarify the {{correlation}} between the new tendencies in labor employment and the on-going changes in <b>rural</b> <b>societies.</b> The rapid growth of the Japanese economy has speeded up the splitting-up of the class of farmers， and an essential portion of farm labor has drifted to urban districts. Consquently，mechanization of farming has been promoted by the wealthier farmer　since the middle of 1960 ，but the decrease　in the labor force has created a most critical stage in rural districts. 　　This study is an attempt to specify the influence　of this lack of labor in <b>rural</b> <b>societies</b> with the conclusive remark that in a great ideal of the <b>rural</b> <b>societies</b> of Hok kaido there have appeared employed labor groups （“Kumi”）and that these groups are greatly influencing the <b>rural</b> <b>society</b> of Hokkaido...|$|R

However, Dr. Teizo Toda who led the social research in China during the War was a person who studied family sociology in the Unite States in the 1920 ’s.
