A comparison of the simulation model of the induction machine and a laboratory machine to a sinusoidal supply voltage is presented. The control system gains are determined using the steady state solution of the discrete Ricatti equation developed in linear quadratic optimal control theory. A simulation of the system is developed and used to demonstrate the open loop starting characteristic of the system, evaluate the convergence properties of the gain calculations and demonstrate the stability of the resulting feedback controller. Open and closed loop system pole placement is evaluated using transform methods. Simulation results show that the gain calculations converge in five iterations on the first sample instant of closed loop operation, and subsequently converge in one iteration and that the closed loop system is stable. Evaluation of the closed loop system pole placement also indicates stability of the perturbation controller...|$|R

40|$|On-line partial {{discharge}} (PD) measurement is a recognized tool {{to assess the}} condition of stator winding insulation of <b>rotating</b> <b>machines</b> under normal machine operation. 80 pF high voltage capacitors {{have been widely used}} as a sensor for PD measurement in <b>rotating</b> <b>machines</b> for more than ten years. However, its detection sensitivity with respect to various types of <b>rotating</b> <b>machines</b> has not been fully investigated. As we know, PD activity in lower-voltage (e. g. 3. 3 kV- 6. 9 kV) <b>rotating</b> <b>machines</b> is usually lower than that in higher-voltage <b>rotating</b> <b>machines.</b> Therefore, PD sensors with a higher sensitivity are required to detect relatively small PD pulses in lower-voltage <b>rotating</b> <b>machines.</b> This paper presents theoretical analysis, laboratory tests and field test experience to compare the sensitivity of 80 pF capacitors and 500 pF capacitors for on-line PD measurement in lower-voltage <b>rotating</b> <b>machines.</b> The PD detection sensitivity is studied by characterizing the frequency bandwidth of various capacitors and the frequency spectrum of a PD pulse. The relationship between the frequency characteristics of the various capacitors and the PD pulse indicates that the capacitor with a higher capacitance can detect more energy of the PD pulse, hence increasing PD detection sensitivity. The field test on a 6. 9 kV operating motor verifies that the 500 pF capacitor can detect the PD activity which the 80 pF capacitor was not able to. A comparison of statistics analysis of a number of motors installed with 500 pF capacitors and 80 pF capacitors shows that 500 pF capacitors detect more PD activity than 80 pF capacitors. This investigation concludes that 500 pF capacitors have higher sensitivity in PD measurement in <b>rotating</b> <b>machines</b> than 80 pF capacitors. 500 pF capacitors have been installed on more than forty <b>rotating</b> <b>machines</b> in utilities and petrochemical industries...|$|R

The concept of Vibration Signature Analysis of <b>Rotating</b> <b>Machines</b> lies {{on the fact that}} all <b>rotating</b> <b>machines</b> in good condition have a fairly stable vibration pattern, which can be considered its 'Signature'.

In a large plant, because there are an enormous number of <b>rotating</b> <b>machines,</b> condition surveillance for all <b>rotating</b> <b>machines</b> is time consuming and labor intensive and the accuracy of condition judgment is not ensured. These difficulties may cause serious machine accidents and great production losses. In order to improve the efficiency of the condition surveillance and detect faults at an early stage, the present paper proposes a method of condition surveillance for plant rotating machinery using a “Partially-Linearized Neural Network (PLNN) ” by which the state of a <b>rotating</b> <b>machine</b> can be automatically judged {{on the basis of the}} possibility of normal and abnormal states. When input the rotating speed, power, shaft diameter and vibration parameter (root mean square, RMS) of a <b>rotating</b> <b>machine</b> into the PLNN, after learning has been completed, the PLNN will output the possibilities of normal and abnormal states for the inspected <b>rotating</b> <b>machine.</b> Practical examples of condition surveillance for plant rotating machinery will verify that the proposed method is effective.

40|$|Since {{the slight}} fault feature of {{incipient}} fault is usually polluted by heavy background noise, {{it is difficult}} to extract the weak feature signal in <b>rotating</b> <b>machine.</b> As an adaptive decomposing technique, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based denoising methods have a good effect on the feature separation and noise elimination. However, for <b>rotating</b> <b>machine</b> with poor working environment, the components attributed to noise might have higher amplitudes, which restrict the efficiency of noise reduction in current EMD-based denoising methods. Therefore, a probabilistic entropy EMD thresholding algorithm for periodic fault signal enhancement in <b>rotating</b> <b>machine</b> is proposed in this paper. In this method, the entropy threshold of each IMF is constructed instead of the threshold applied to N sampling points of each IMF directly, which overcomes the shortcoming of the denoising effect limited by larger amplitude noise reservation and smaller amplitude feature signal reduction in the current denoising methods. Meanwhile, {{in order to make the}} amplitudes of all the IMF reduce in a smooth way, a multiscale thresholding algorithm based on quantile statistics to provide probability indexes is presented.
