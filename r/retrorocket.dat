5|$|The {{spacecraft}} and booster {{were almost}} identical to those used on the two preceding Mercury orbital flights. The spacecraft had heating blankets removed from the <b>retrorocket</b> motors, to save weight, and a SOFAR bomb was added. This would be ejected {{at the time the}} main parachute was deployed, and would help recovery crews find the spacecraft after it landed. A number of modifications were made to the reaction control system, and the communications equipment was upgraded.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} Voskhod was a stripped-down vehicle {{from which}} any excess weight had been removed; although a backup retrofire engine was added, since {{the more powerful}} Voskhod rocket used to launch the craft would send it to a higher orbit than the Vostok, eliminating {{the possibility of a}} natural decay of the orbit and reentry in case of primary <b>retrorocket</b> failure. After one unmanned test flight, this spacecraft carried a crew of three cosmonauts, Komarov, Yegorov and Feoktistov, into space on 12 October 1964 and completed sixteen orbits. This craft was designed to perform a soft landing, eliminating a need for the ejection system; but the crew was sent into orbit without space suits or a launch abort system.|$|E
25|$|A rocket parachute, the PRSM-915, was {{developed}} to ensure the vehicle's safe landing. To use the parachute, the BMD is first packed onto a special pallet before takeoff. To drop the BMD, a drogue chute is released that initially drags the BMD out of the Il-76 transport plane. Once clear of the plane a single large main chute opens. The deployment of the main chute triggers the deployment of four long rods which hang beneath the pallet. As soon as the rods touch the ground a <b>retrorocket</b> fires, slowing the BMD to a descending speed between 6m/s and 7m/s and giving it a relatively soft landing. It allowed a BMD to be relatively safely parachuted with both the driver and the gunner. This system entered service in 1975 for the BMD-1, and was always used for the BMD-2 afterwards.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{the high}} {{reliability}} demanded by <b>retrorockets,</b> Mercury spacecraft used a trio of solid fuel, 1000 lbf (4.5 kN) thrust <b>retrorockets</b> strapped to the heat shield {{on the bottom of}} the spacecraft that fired for 10 seconds each. One was sufficient to return the spacecraft to earth if the other two failed.|$|R

50|$|Two solid motor <b>retrorockets</b> {{were located}} inside {{each of the}} four conical engine fairings. At {{separation}} of the S-IC from the flight vehicle, the eight <b>retrorockets</b> fired, blowing off removable sections of the fairings forward of the fins, and backing the S-IC away from the flight vehicle as the engines on the S-II stage were ignited.|$|R
25|$|T. Keith Glennan {{had been}} {{appointed}} the first Administrator of NASA, with Hugh L. Dryden (last Director of NACA) as his Deputy, at {{the creation of the}} agency on October 1, 1958. Glennan would report to the president through the National Aeronautics and Space Council. The group responsible for Project Mercury was NASA's Space Task Group, and the goals of the program were to orbit a manned spacecraft around Earth, investigate the pilot's ability to function in space, and to recover both pilot and spacecraft safely. Existing technology and off-the-shelf equipment would be used wherever practical, the simplest and most reliable approach to system design would be followed, and an existing launch vehicle would be employed, together with a progressive test program. Spacecraft requirements included: a launch escape system to separate the spacecraft and its occupant from the launch vehicle in case of impending failure; attitude control for orientation of the spacecraft in orbit; a <b>retrorocket</b> system to bring the spacecraft out of orbit; drag braking blunt body for atmospheric reentry; and landing on water. To communicate with the spacecraft during an orbital mission, an extensive communications network had to be built. In keeping with his desire to keep from giving the U.S. space program an overly military flavor, President Eisenhower at first hesitated to give the project top national priority (DX rating under the Defense Production Act), which meant that Mercury had to wait in line behind military projects for materials; however, this rating was granted in May 1959, {{a little more than a}} year and a half after Sputnik was launched.|$|E
500|$|After a {{long series}} of delays, Friendship 7 lifted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on February 20, 1962. There were eleven delays during the {{countdown}} due to equipment malfunctions, improvements to equipment functioning properly and the weather. During Glenn's first orbit, a failure of the automatic-control system was detected. This forced Glenn to operate in manual mode for the second and third orbits, and for re-entry. Later in the flight, telemetry indicated that the heat shield had loosened. If this reading were accurate, Glenn and his spacecraft would burn up on re-entry. After a lengthy discussion {{on how to deal with}} this problem, ground controllers decided that leaving the solid-fueled <b>retrorocket</b> pack in place might help keep the loose heat shield in place. They relayed these instructions to Glenn, but did not tell him that the heat shield was possibly loose; although confused at this order, he complied. Leaving the <b>retrorocket</b> pack on made large chunks of flaming debris fly past the window of his capsule during re-entry, which Glenn thought it might have been the heat shield. He told an interviewer, [...] "Fortunately it was the rocket pack—or I wouldn't be answering these questions." [...] After the flight, it was determined that the heat shield was not loose, but rather that the sensor was faulty.|$|E
500|$|On {{consulting}} with his flight controllers, Kraft {{became convinced that}} the indication was false, and that no action was needed. However, his superiors, including Mercury capsule designer Max Faget, felt differently. They overruled Kraft, telling him to instruct Glenn to leave the capsule's <b>retrorocket</b> package on during re-entry. The reasoning was that the package, which was strapped over the heatshield, would hold the heatshield in place if it was loose. Kraft, however, {{felt that this was}} an unacceptable risk. [...] "I was aghast," [...] he remembered. [...] "If any of three retrorockets had solid fuel remaining, an explosion could rip everything apart." [...] Yet he agreed to follow the plan advocated by Faget and by Walt Williams, his superior in the flight operations division. The retrorockets would be kept on.|$|E
50|$|The rocket {{reached a}} maximum height of 129 km and a peak {{velocity}} of 5906 km per hour. At this stage it also fired <b>retrorockets</b> {{that would be}} used on later missions to separate the rocket stages. On SA-4 the stages were not designed to separate but tested the <b>retrorockets</b> to make sure they would fire.|$|R

50|$|The Apollo program did {{not require}} <b>retrorockets</b> for lunar flights, as the flight from the moon was {{directed}} to fly the spacecraft directly back to earth, and not enter orbit. However, the flights in earth orbit for tests required <b>retrorockets,</b> so the large, versatile Service Propulsion Module on the Service Module was used to decelerate the spacecraft. The Space Shuttle would use a similar multipurpose engine for reentry.|$|R
2500|$|Larger rockets are {{normally}} launched from a launch pad that provides stable support {{until a few}} seconds after ignition. Due to their high exhaust velocity——rockets are particularly useful when very high speeds are required, such as orbital speed at approximately [...] Spacecraft delivered into orbital trajectories become artificial satellites, which are used for many commercial purposes. Indeed, rockets remain {{the only way to}} launch spacecraft into orbit and beyond. They are also used to rapidly accelerate spacecraft when they change orbits or de-orbit for landing. Also, a rocket may be used to soften a hard parachute landing immediately before touchdown (see <b>retrorocket).</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Lander's Robotic Arm touched soil on the {{red planet}} {{for the first time}} on May 31, 2008 (sol [...] ). It scooped dirt and started {{sampling}} the Martian soil for ice after days of testing. Phoenixs Robotic Arm Camera took an image underneath the lander on sol 5 that shows patches of a smooth bright surface uncovered when thruster exhaust blew off overlying loose soil. It was later shown to be ice.O at the Phoenix Landing Site. [...] Science: 325, 58-61. Ray Arvidson of Washington University in St. Louis said: [...] "We could very well be seeing rock, or we could be seeing exposed ice in the <b>retrorocket</b> blast zone." ...|$|E
50|$|A backup solid-fueled <b>retrorocket</b> {{was added}} {{to the top of the}} descent module in the event that the main <b>retrorocket</b> failed. This had not been {{necessary}} on Vostok as the orbit was low enough that the spacecraft would decay in ten days if the <b>retrorocket</b> failed, there being enough onboard consumables to sustain the cosmonaut that long. In any case, the Blok E equipped R-7 booster lacked sufficient lift capacity for a backup <b>retrorocket.</b> Since Voskhod was well below the maximum lift capacity of the larger Blok I equipped R-7, it would be put into a quite high orbit and not decay in ten days.|$|E

25|$|The Retro module {{contained}} four solid-fuel TE-M-385 Star-13E <b>retrorockets,</b> each spherical {{in shape}} except for its rocket nozzle, which were structurally attached to two beams that {{reached across the}} diameter of the retro module, crossing at right angles in the center. Re-entry began with the <b>retrorockets</b> firing one at a time. Abort procedures at certain periods during lift-off would cause them to fire at the same time, thrusting the Descent module away from the Titan rocket.|$|R
50|$|When a {{spacecraft}} in orbit is slowed sufficiently, its altitude decreases {{to the point}} at which aerodynamic forces begin to rapidly slow the motion of the vehicle, and it returns to the ground. Without <b>retrorockets,</b> spacecraft would remain in orbit for years until their orbits naturally slow, and reenter the atmosphere at a much later date; in the case of manned flights, long after life support systems have been expended. Therefore, it is critical that spacecraft have extremely reliable <b>retrorockets.</b>|$|R

50|$|It was {{believed}} that the improper pitch signals on Samos 4's launch vehicle had been caused by accidental separation of a heat shield covering the <b>retrorockets</b> on the Atlas equipment pods. This would have caused aerodynamic heating of the pitch gyro, and the failure was extremely similar to an incident {{that occurred during the}} launch of Midas 4 a month earlier, and it led to redesigned heat shields over the <b>retrorockets.</b> The guidance system tracking beacon had also failed in flight, causing the absence of programmed BECO/SECO commands.|$|R

5000|$|This, the {{eleventh}} Soviet attempt {{to achieve a}} lunar soft landing, nearly succeeded. After a successful midcourse correction on 4 December, this spacecraft headed toward the Moon without any apparent problems. Just before the scheduled firing of its <b>retrorocket,</b> a command was sent to inflate cushioning air bags around the landing probe. However, a plastic mounting bracket apparently pierced {{one of the two}} air bags. The resulting ejection of the air put the spacecraft into a spin of about 12 degrees per second. The spacecraft momentarily regained its proper attitude, long enough for a nine-second-long <b>retrorocket</b> firing, but Luna 8 became unstable again. Without a <b>retrorocket</b> burn long enough to reduce its velocity sufficiently for a survivable landing, Luna 8 plummeted to the lunar surface and crashed at 21:51:30 UT on 6 December in the west of Oceanus Procellarum. The coordinates of the crash site are [...]|$|E
50|$|At 07:25 UT, the spacecraft's {{automatic}} systems {{brought it}} into the required attitude (orientation) for the <b>retrorocket</b> firing, and shortly afterwards, the liquid-fueled engine fired for about 42 seconds over {{the west coast of}} Africa, near Angola, about 8000 km uprange of the landing point. The orbit's perigee and apogee had been selected to cause reentry due to orbital decay within 10 days (the limit of the life support system function) in the event of <b>retrorocket</b> malfunction. However, the actual orbit differed from the planned and would not have allowed descent until 20 days.|$|E
50|$|With Liberty Bell 7 at an {{altitude}} of 118.26 mi, it was now time to position the spacecraft in its reentry attitude. Grissom had initiated the <b>retrorocket</b> sequence and the spacecraft was arcing downward. His pulse reached 171 beats per minute. Retrofire gave him the distinct and peculiar feeling that he had reversed his backward flight through space and was actually moving face forward. As he plummeted downward, he saw what appeared to be two of the spent retrorockets pass across the periscope view after the <b>retrorocket</b> package had been jettisoned.|$|E
50|$|However, <b>retrorockets</b> {{were used}} to back the S-IC and S-II stages off after their {{respective}} shutdowns during the rocket's journey from the launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center to Earth Parking Orbit.|$|R

5000|$|Preparations for lithobraking involve {{protecting}} the probe with sufficient cushioning to withstand an impact with {{the surface and}} come to rest undamaged. The first successful lithobraking was achieved by the Soviet Luna 9 probe resulting in the first soft landing on the Moon. Unlike the US Surveyor probes that relied entirely on <b>retrorockets,</b> first Luna landers used a combination of <b>retrorockets</b> and gas-filled cushioning bags to reach the lunar surface safely. Soviet and US landers used airbag-like lithobraking for Mars landing missions as well. Alternatively due to extremely dense atmosphere on Venus later generation Venera landers used hard umbrella-like aerobraker in combination with shock absorbers.|$|R
50|$|If the <b>retrorocket</b> failed, the {{spacecraft}} would naturally decay from orbit within ten days, and the cosmonaut was provided with enough food and oxygen to survive until that time.|$|E
5000|$|The spacecraft's VA capsule {{was greatly}} {{modified}} to carry instruments - the <b>retrorocket</b> and parachute packages {{were replaced by}} scientific equipment, including an infrared telescope and the Ozon spectrometer.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of weight}} constraints, {{there was no}} backup <b>retrorocket</b> engine. The {{spacecraft}} carried 10 days of provisions to allow for survival and natural orbital decay in the event the retrorockets failed.|$|E
50|$|Following re-entry, the module's parachutes {{deployed}} only partially, and {{a failure}} of the soft-landing <b>retrorockets</b> in the base of the descent module caused a hard landing which almost wrecked the module, and broke some of Volynov's teeth.|$|R
5000|$|Mercury {{spacecraft}} No. 5 contained six {{new systems}} {{that had not}} been on previous flights: environmental control system, attitude stabilization control system, live <b>retrorockets,</b> voice communications system, [...] "closed loop" [...] abort sensing system, and a pneumatic landing bag.|$|R
50|$|Because Soyuz 21 was {{returning}} early, it {{was outside the}} normal recovery window. It then encountered strong winds as it descended, which caused uneven firing of the <b>retrorockets.</b> It made a hard landing around midnight 200 km southwest of Kokchetav, Kazakhstan.|$|R
