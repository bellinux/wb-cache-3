Undergraduates enrolled in The Honors College participate in smaller classes with faculty, including individual research programs or assigned <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> a sponsoring faculty member. Another program offered by the college is Honors in the Major, which allows juniors and seniors to conduct original research within their major and write an undergraduate honors thesis.

Her group combined their research efforts with those of her husband, who was also employed at the University of Michigan as a biological psychiatrist. After characterizing the anatomy of four opioid peptides, beta-endorphin, dynorphin, methionine enkephalin, and leucine enkephalin, and their receptors, the two groups cloned two types of receptors and performed structure-function analyses {{in order to determine}} the molecular basis of high affinity and selectivity towards endogenous ligands. Over the years the two laboratories have conducted extensive research in a variety of molecular and neural mechanisms associated with stress reactivity and their relation to anxiety and depression, focusing on the link of opioids and their receptors in stress induced analgesia as well as the role of steroid stress hormone receptors in emotionality. Furthermore, Akil and Watson were the first to demonstrate that there is an abnormal, decreased sensitivity to glucocorticoid fast feedback that occurs at the level of the brain, rather than the pituitary in depressed patients.|$|E

[...] Currently, solar cells cannot exceed efficiencies of about 30% (First Generation). [...] With new technologies (Third Generation), efficiencies of up to 40-60% can be expected.
