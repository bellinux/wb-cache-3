40|$|Based on a <b>road</b> <b>meteorology</b> standard, {{we present}} a {{roadside}} camera-based system able to detect daytime fog and to estimate the visibility range. Two detection algorithms, both based on a daytime fog model, are presented along with a process to combine their outputs. Unlike previous methods, the system {{takes into account the}} 3 -D scene structure and filters the moving objects from the region of interest through use of a background modelling approach and detects the cause of the visibility reduction. The study of the system accuracy with respect to the camera characteristics leads to a specification of the characteristics of the camera required for the system. Some results obtained using a reduced-scale prototyping of the system are presented. Finally, an outlook to future works is given...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} new method {{for construction of}} hierarchical regression models by combining the predetermined groups of data based on the knowledge of compatibility and/or similarity of models. Regression models are widely used in many areas. The simplest, linear regression models are often chosen because of their robustness. In this work we consider {{a case in which}} the data can be split into multiple subsets on which the predicted outcome is linear. While such data cannot be modelled with a single linear model, inducing a separate linear model for each subset would yield inaccurate models due to small samples. This problem can be nicely framed in the theory of bias-variance decomposition of error. A single model would have an unacceptably high bias, while separate models would have high variances. Based on this theoretical justification, we developed a method for hierarchical construction of linear models, which starts with separate models for each subgroup and then iteratively merges them until the effect of decreased variance due to larger data samples available for each model begins to be overcome by the increased bias due to treating a non-linear relation as linear. We tested the method on controlled synthetic data, which proved the correctness of our approach. The method was then tested on the data on road meteorology: we were able to successfully predict the road surface temperature for several hours ahead. This result is interesting for the field of <b>road</b> <b>meteorology</b> as it shows {{that it is possible to}} construct models with good forecasting accuracy with statistical methods alone. The advantage of such modelling compared to physical models based on energy balance equation is that they do not require any knowledge about the road construction properties. Their weakness is that they require past data from road weather station at a particular location. To overcome this problem, we investigated a problem in which the data for several locations is available and the task is to find a predictive model for a new location based on the known physical, but easily obtainable similarities between this and other locations, such as sky visibility and similar. We first checked that the attributes that we chose to describe locations are indeed correlated with coefficients from regression models. Based on positive findings of this study, we defined a modelling technique that can construct a linear model for the location based on linear models for other locations. We again first empirically tested the method on synthetic data constructed in such a way that it fulfills the assumptions of the method, and then on the actual data from the road weather stations. As expected, the accuracy of such models is below those constructed from the actual data, yet still quite in the acceptable range for its potential practical use. Results of the dissertation may find practical use. Forecasts of road weather conditions are a valuable resource for drivers, as well as for road maintenance services, in particular in winter. More accurate forecasts can provide safer roads while cutting down the maintenance costs and minimizing the environmental damage from over-salting. ...|$|E
40|$|AbSTRACT. in the Canadian Arctic, winter {{roads are}} {{engineered}} across the frozen land, rivers, and lakes. The strength and longevity of these roads depend on particular weather conditions. Our {{research focuses on}} the winter road between Tulita and Norman Wells, Northwest Territories, which has been maintained officially by the territorial government since 1982. Statistical analysis of the opening dates for the winter road showed five seasons with extremely early dates and five with extremely late dates. The extremely early-opening seasons are distinguished by anomalously high sea-level pressures, anomalously cold tropospheric air, and northwesterly surface winds during the November prior to the road opening. The extremely late-opening seasons are characterized by an anomalously strong Aleutian low in the preceding November. The extremely late-opening years are correlated with strong El Niño seasons, whereas the extremely early-opening years are not systematically associated with teleconnection patterns. Our analysis of meteorological conditions near Norman Wells, associated with the extreme opening dates for this winter road, may provide planners with more precise information germane to this road construction.

40|$|The UK National Air Quality Strategy (NAQS) {{recognises}} transport as a {{major source}} of many significant atmospheric pollutants, particularly in towns and cities. Consequently, a key goal of the White paper "A New Deal for Transport: Better for Everyone " is to address, through transport planning, the objectives of the NAQS, including exceedences of prescribed air quality standards and the adverse effects on health of ambient air quality. This paper describes the development of a modelling package {{that can be used to}} support the NAQS. The package includes TEMMS (Traffic Emissions Modelling and Mapping Suite), which provides detailed estimates of vehicle emissions on urban road networks, together with a stationary source emissions database and an atmospheric dispersion model that collectively permit a detailed spatial assessment of urban air quality in response to <b>road</b> traffic and <b>meteorology.</b> The model package provides the basis upon which the health impacts of alternative traffic scenarios can be compared...|$|R
40|$|Traffic exhaust is {{a source}} of air {{contaminants}} that have adverse health effects. Quantification of traffic as an exposure variable is complicated by aerosol dispersion related to variation in layout of <b>roads,</b> traffic density, <b>meteorology,</b> and topography. A statistical model is presented which uses Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology to incorporate variables into a generalized linear model that estimates distribution of traffic-related pollution. Exposure from a source is expressed as an integral of a function proportional to average daily traffic and a nonparametric dispersion function which {{takes the form of a}} step, polynomial or spline model. The method may be applied using standard regression techniques for fitting generalized linear models. Modifiers of pollutant dispersion such as wind direction, meteorology, and landscape features can also be included. Two examples are given to illustrate the method. The first employs data from a study in which NO 2 (a known pollutant from automobile exhaust) was monitored outside of 138 Connecticut homes, providing a model for estimating NO 2 exposure. In a second example, estimated levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) from the model, as well as a separate spatial model, were used to analyze traffic-related health effects in a study of 761 infants...|$|R
40|$|Exposure models {{need to be}} {{developed}} which can be applied at the continental scale, while still reflecting local variations in exposure conditions. Land use regression (LUR) has been widely adopted to describe the spatial variations in air pollutants over the longer term but not for short-term time-variable exposures. This study, therefore, aimed to develop and validate a space-time O 3 model applicable to epidemiological studies investigating the health effects of short-term (e. g. daily) O 3 exposures at the small-area scale. A geographical information system (GIS) was developed, incorporating data from 1211 O 3 monitoring sites across Western Europe and a range of predictors, stored as 100 m grids, including land cover, <b>roads,</b> topography and <b>meteorology.</b> The spatial model consisted of a LUR model representing the long-term average for years 2001 - 2007. The monitoring sites were classified, using multivariate statistical techniques, into 13 site types based on a set of descriptive indicators, then 13 temporal models represented by time functions were produced – one for each site type. These were linked to the spatial model using probability of group membership as a weighting factor. Finally, local meteorological data were incorporated to produce the full space-time model to predict daily concentrations for point locations. The spatial and temporal models were individually evaluated based on agreement with measurement data from a reserved subset of 20...|$|R
40|$|Cyclists might {{experience}} increased {{air pollution}} exposure, {{due to the}} proximity to traffic, and higher intake, due to their active travel mode and higher ventilation. Several local factors, like <b>meteorology,</b> <b>road</b> and traffic features, and bike lanes features, affect cyclists’ exposure to traffic-related pollutants. This paper investigates the concentration levels {{and the effect of}} the features of the bike lanes on cyclists’ exposure to airborne ultrafine particulate matter (UFP) and black carbon (BC) in the mid-sized city of Piacenza, located {{in the middle of the}} Po Valley, Northern Italy. Monitoring campaigns were performed by means of portable instruments along different urban bike routes with bike lanes, characterized by different distances from the traffic source (on-road cycle lane, separated cycle lane, green cycle path), during morning (9 : 00 am– 10 : 00 am) and evening (17 : 30 pm– 18 : 30 pm) workday rush hours in both cold and warm seasons. The proximity to traffic significantly affected cyclists’ exposure to UFP and BC: exposure concentrations measured for the separated lane and for the green path were 1 – 2 times and 2 – 4 times lower than for the on-road lane. Concurrent measurements showed that exposure concentrations to PM 10, PM 2. 5, and PM 1 were not influenced by traffic proximity, without any significant variation between on-road cycle lane, separated lane, or green cycle path. Thus, for the location of this study PM mass-based metrics were not able to capture local scale concentration gradients in the urban area as a consequence of the rather high urban and regional background that hides the contribution of local scale sources, such as road traffic. The impact of route choice on cyclists’ exposure to UFPs and BC during commuting trips back and forth from a residential area to the train station has been also estimated through a probabilistic approach through an iterative Monte Carlo technique, based on the measured data. Compared to the best choice, a worst-route choice can result in an increased cumulative exposure up to about 50 % for UFPs, without any relevant difference between cold and warm season, and from 20 % in the cold season up to 90 % in the warm season for equivalent black carbon concentration (EBC) ...|$|R
