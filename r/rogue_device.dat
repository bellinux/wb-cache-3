40|$|Abstract. Creating a trust {{relationship}} between two devices is commonly designated as pairing protocol. This practice {{is essential for}} the security of dynamic networks as it protects against <b>rogue</b> <b>device</b> insertion. If the pairing itself is not secure all afterward security will be compromised. All existing methods require either a pre-existing secure channel between devices or a common security context (e. g. Public Key Infrastructure) or the handling of cryptographic information by the user. All these requirements are rarely achieved in practice. We propose a solution where these requirements are relaxed. In particular, the user is not required to memorize type-in or even check any cryptographic information. Therefore, this solution is suitable for devices with only LEDs and a button such as WiFi access points, modems and small portable devices...|$|E

The security of such applications is clearly critical. A key feature of RFID-based systems is their very short range: Typical systems are designed to operate at a range of 5 - 10 cm. Despite this very short nominal range, Kfir and Wool predicted that a <b>rogue</b> <b>device</b> can communicate with an ISO- 14443 RFID tag {{from a distance of}} 40 - 50 cm, based on modeling and simulations. Moreover, they claimed that such a device can be made portable, with low power requirements, and can be built very cheaply. Such a device {{can be used as a}} stand-alone RFID skimmer, to surreptitiously read the contents of simple RFID tags. The same device can be as the “leech ” part of a relay-attack system, by which an attacker can make purchases using a victim’s RFID-enhanced credit card—despite any cryptographic protocols that may be used. In this study we show that the modeling predictions are quite accurate. We show how to build a portable, extended-range RFID skimmer, using only electronics hobbyist supplies and tools. Our skimmer is able to read ISO- 14443 tags from a distance of ≈ 25 cm, uses a lightweight 40 cm-diameter copper-tube antenna, is powered by a 12 V battery—and requires a budget of ≈ $ 100.

40|$|Abstract. The trusted {{computing}} group (TCG) specified two protocols {{that allow}} a trusted hardware device to remotely convince a communication partner {{that it is}} indeed a trusted hardware device. In turn, This enables two communication partners to establish that the other end is a secure computing platform and hence it is safe exchange data. Both these remote identification protocols provide some degree of privacy to users of the platforms. That is, the communication partners can only establish that the other end uses some trusted hardware device but not which particular one. The first protocol achieves this property by involving trusted third party called Privacy CA in each transaction. This party must be fully trusted by all other parties. In practice, however, this is a strong requirement {{that is hard to}} fulfill. Therefore, TCG proposed a second protocol called direct anonymous attestation that overcomes this drawback using techniques known from group signature schemes. However, it offers less privacy than the one involving the Privacy CA. The {{reason for this is that}} the protocol needs to allow the verifier to detect <b>rogue</b> hardware <b>devices</b> while before this detection was done by the Privacy CA. In this paper we show how to extend the direct anonymous attestation protocols such that if offers the same degree of privacy as the first solution but still allows the verifier to <b>rogue</b> <b>devices.</b> ...|$|R

We demonstrate that the DAIR framework is useful for detecting <b>rogue</b> wireless <b>devices</b> (e. g., access points) attached to corporate networks, {{as well as for}} detecting Denial of Service attacks on Wi-Fi networks. Prior proposals in this area include monitoring the network via a combination of access points (APs), mobile clients, and dedicated sensor nodes. We show that a dense deployment of sensors is necessary to effectively monitor Wi-Fi networks for certain types of threats, and one can not accomplish this using access points alone. An ordinary, single-radio AP can not monitor multiple channels effectively, without adversely impacting the associated clients. Moreover, we show that a typical deployment of access points is not sufficiently dense to detect the presence of <b>rogue</b> wireless <b>devices.</b> Due to power constraints, mobile devices can provide only limited assistance in monitoring wireless networks. Deploying a dense array of dedicated sensor nodes is an expensive proposition. Our solution is based on two simple observations. First, in most enterprise environments, one finds plenty of desktop machines with good wired connectivity, and spare CPU and disk resources. Second, inexpensive USB-based wireless adapters are commonly available.

Without an IOMMU a pe-ripheral device could be programmed to over-write any part of the system’s memory. Operat-ing systems utilize IOMMUs to isolate device drivers; hypervisors utilize IOMMUs to grant secure direct hardware access to virtual ma-chines.

This setting does pose particular security challenges. As the devices operate under physical control of the end users, their integrity has be ensured and must be able to be verified by the network. This is achieved through the functionality of Trusted Computing. Additionally, the domains of the different content providers have to be isolated in such a way that an attacker cannot use one of them as a foothold to compromise or snoop on the operation of the network or another isolated domain.

The software tools and hardware devices to monitor WiFi networking signals have long {{been a part of}} the security auditor’s arsenal, but similar tools for Bluetooth were bespoke, expensive, and beyond the scope of most security professionals. However, this has changed with the introduction of the Ubertooth One, a low-cost and open-source platform for monitoring Bluetooth Classic signals.

This work attempts to compare the results of scanning with traditional Bluetooth devices alone, compared to an Ubertooth/Bluetooth combination. Highlighting how this newfound ability to monitor a larger portion of Bluetooth traffic can potentially highlight serious implications in the compliance landscape of many organisations and companies.

Apart from the lack of automatic clustering, the original BB-NAC overlooked the evolution of the mechanism as new behavior profiles were computed over time. As part of our enhancements, we also present an incremental-learning algorithm that automatically updates the behavior-based access control policies. We show that the algorithm is resilient to compromised or fabricated profiles trying to manipulate the policies. We provide extensive experiments with real user profiles computed with their network flows processed from Cisco NetFlow logs captured at our host institution. Our results show that behavior-based access control policies enhance conventional NAC technologies. Specifically, we achieve true rejection rates of 95 % for anomalous user profiles separated by one standard deviation from the normal user network behavior.

This report explores developments in information and communications technology (ICT) that support the collection, connection and analysis of data through sensing and monitoring. Sensors are parts of all machines that gather data and have an integral role in subsequent processing and transport of data. Monitoring is a process that observes a state in time or tracks changes in data sets to derive information. Together,sensing and monitoring provide a mechanism for harvesting digital data. This growth in digital data {{is being used to}} drive changes in production and distribution processes and the reach of services in the Australian economy. Sensor developments in miniaturisation and the integration of sensors into intelligent devices and systems have increased the capacity to measure, analyse and aggregate data at a very localised level. Built on the increasing capabilities of fixed-access and wireless networks, smart sensor developments allow the collection of raw data, which is processed into information and conveyed via a network connection. Data processing capabilities have also been streamlined and automated through the use of data centres and pattern recognition processes that allow near real-time data mining and analysis. Using the infrastructure of the internet and machine-to-machine communications has allowed the connection of more devices and transfer of more information not directly controlled or monitored by humans. The exponential {{increase in the number of}} devices with digital connectivity will require new connection and management processes. Addressing and identifying a population of potentially tens of billions of devices requires reliable, scalable and flexible systems to work between industry entities and consumers. The combination of these technology developments means that information is now gathered from more human and machine-based sources, and analysed and disseminated than ever before. Information harvesting through sensing and monitoring is increasingly pervasive in many aspects of day-to-day life and is being used to drive changes in life-supporting sectors such as food, health, energy, environment, and entertainment and social engagement. Identity management of millions of autonomous mobile sensor devices in a global environment presents challenges for sensor network operators and device life-cycle management. Dealing with 2 ̆ 7 smart junk‘, or the accumulation of lost or <b>rogue</b> <b>devices</b> without a traceable identity, is one of the challenges in managing device and data growth. Trusted relationships between consumers and industry will need to be extended to devices in this environment. Data ownership, privacy, longevity of access and use are all potential issues in the provision of services to consumers in a smart digital economy. Consumers are also becoming increasingly aware of invasions to privacy through direct harvesting of information by application and service providers. While sensing and monitoring data may empower people to make better decisions in real time, if information systems are not transparent and understood by citizens these decisions may be regarded as coerced rather than empowering. The ACMA will continue to monitor activities in the harvesting and use of information by services application...|$|R

40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Informática (Engenharia Informática), Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Ciências, 2015 Although the {{computational}} {{power of}} mobile devices has been increasing, {{it is still}} not enough for some classes of applications. In the present, these applications delegate the computing power burden on servers located on the Internet. This model assumes an always-on Internet connectivity and implies a non-negligible latency. Cloud computing is an innovative computing paradigm where the resources made available by a number of servers are transparently shared by its users. Cloud computing simplifies resource management, establishing the ground for the elastic computing concept, where each user can easily enlarge or reduce his amount of resources. The thesis studies the challenges and contributions posed to the application of the cloud computing concept to wireless networks. The goal is to define a reference architecture for high performance mobile application, the Collaborative Cloudless Computing (C 3) together with a framework that addresses the challenges raised decomposing it on a series of components. The framework, named Mobile Collaborative Cloudless Computing Environment (MC 3 E) dismisses the connection to the Internet. In this scenario, computing power is obtained from neighbouring mobile devices, which coordinate to achieve a common goal: the execution of tasks requested by one or more participants. Expectations are that the use of the C 3 concept contributes to: i) reduce the response time, in comparison with delegations on commercial clouds; ii) reduces user frustration when Internet connectivity is not available or its bandwidth is not sufficient; and iii) alleviates the bandwidth consumed by these applications in the cellular infra-structure. Allowing a mobile device to provide a service to the neighbouring peers carries non-negligible risks, of which confidentiality, privacy and selfishness are good examples. To discourage selfishness, two approaches are typically taken: i) in trade based systems, devices agree on a retribution for the execution of a task; ii) in trust based systems <b>rogue</b> <b>devices</b> are detected and advertised by their peers. This thesis describes and evaluates a hybrid system, combining trade and trust-based characteristics. We call this approach the Hybrid Trust and Trade system (HTnT). HTnT suits well privacy requirements as it assumes and encourages users to frequently change their pseudonyms. The work shows that the service detects several misbehaving approaches, even without requiring interacting devices to be connected to the Internet. HTnT will use the capability to anticipate a contact with another device. This knowledge is useful for other applications that rely on some form of data harvesting or hoarding. One of the most promising approaches for contact prediction is to extrapolate from past experiences. This work investigates the recurring contact patterns observed between groups of devices using an 9 -year dataset of wireless access logs, produced by 76479 devices that connected to one of the 239 access points of the eduroam network at the Lisbon Polytechnic Institute (IPL). This effort permitted to model the probabilities of occurrence of a contact at a predefined date between groups of devices using a power law distribution that varies according to neighbourhood size and recurrence period. In the general case, the model can be used by applications that need to disseminate large datasets by groups of devices. As an example, we present and evaluate an algorithm that provides daily contact predictions, based on the history of past pairwise contacts and their duration, that will be applied into HTnT. Human mobility pattern analysis also used the same dataset. The understanding of human mobility patterns is key for the development and evaluation of ubiquitous applications. To circumvent the scarcity and difficulties in capturing mobility data, a number of models has been devised. The accuracy in replicating observed human mobility by these models varies. In general, each model concentrates n replicating some of the metrics that have been observed, while neglecting others. Unfortunately, all tend to neglect diversity, in the roles and goals of the users but also in the devices that are used to access the wireless network. We present MobIPLity, a mobility scenario generator that extracts mobility traces from the access records of the IPL dataset. MobIPLity is made publicly available in the expectation that its large scale permits to support evaluations based exclusively on real mobility data, thus removing the uncertainty that emerges from the use of synthetic mobility models. Traces emphasise the differences that can be found between device types, with impact on aspects like the observed trace duration, speed, pause times, inter contact times and availability and which can hardly be replicated on synthetic mobility models. The extracted mobility traces allowed for a comparison with other mobility models, where it was observable that the increasing number of smartphones resulted in significant changes to the utilization pattern, with impact on the amount of traffic and users connection time.
