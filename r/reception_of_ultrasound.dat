40|$|The {{characterization}} of a layered structure {{has been considered}} by many investigators. A variety of techniques has been introduced. Among these normal incidence longitudinal waves can be applied in the low frequency regime, and the transmitted and/or reflected signals {{can be used for}} the evaluation of a layered medium [1, 2]. In the technique discussed in Ref. [1], a reference signal has to be introduced in order to calibrate the evaluation. In recent work by the present authors, a self-compensating technique has been proposed to evaluate a layered structure, in that a ratio of transmission and reflection coefficients has been used [3]. Applications using a self-calibrating or self-compensating technique for the measurement of surface waves reflected or transmitted by a surface-breaking crack have been reported in Refs. [4, 5]. The major advantage of the technique is that the evaluation is independent of the characteristics of transmission and <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> <b>ultrasound</b> by the transducers, the attenuation in the couplant and the surface condition of the specimen.

40|$|Three {{designs for}} {{electrodynamic}} flexural transducers (EDFT) for air-coupled ultrasonics are presented and compared. An all-metal housing {{was used for}} robustness, which makes the designs more suitable for industrial applications. The housing is designed such {{that there is a}} thin metal plate at the front, with a fundamental flexural vibration mode at ∼ 50 kHz. By using a flexural resonance mode, good coupling to the load medium was achieved without the use of matching layers. The front radiating plate is actuated electrodynamically by a spiral coil inside the transducer, which produces an induced magnetic field when an AC current is applied to it. The transducers operate without the use of piezoelectric materials, which can simplify manufacturing and prolong the lifetime of the transducers, as well as open up possibilities for high-temperature applications.

40|$|The {{fabrication}} process of fiber placement system of carbon {{fiber reinforced plastic}} (CFRP) requires real time process control and reliable inspection to ensure quality by preventing defects such as delamination and void. Therefore, novel non-contact inspection technique is required during the non-destructive evaluation in a fiber placement system. For the inspection of delamination in CFRP, various methods to receive laser-generated ultrasound were applied by using piezoelectric transducer, air-coupled transducer, wavelet transform and scanning laser ultrasonic technique. Laser-generated ultrasound was received with a conventional piezoelectric sensor in contacting manner. Then signal characteristics due to defects were analyzed to find a factor for detecting defects. Air-coupled transducer was used for reception of laser-generated guided wave using linear slit array in order to generate high frequency guided wave.

TELIAMADE system consists {{of a set of}} wireless nodes equipped with a radio module for communication and a module for the transmission and <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> <b>ultrasound.</b> The access to the ultrasonic channel is managed by applying a synchronization algorithm based on a time-division multiplexing (TDMA) scheme. The ultrasonic signal is transmitted using a carrier frequency of 40 kHz and the TOF measurement is estimated by applying a quadrature detector to the signal obtained at the A/D converter output. Low sampling frequencies of 17. 78 kHz or even 12. 31 kHz are possible using quadrature sampling in order to optimize memory requirements and to reduce the computational cost in signal processing. The distance is calculated from the TOF taking into account the speed of sound. An excellent accuracy in the estimation of the TOF is achieved using parabolic interpolation to detect of maximum of the signal envelope at the matched filter output. The signal phase information is also used for enhancing the TOF measurement accuracy. Experimental results show a root mean square error (rmse) less than 2 mm and a standard deviation less than 0. 3 mm for pseudorange measurements in the range of distances between 2 and 6 m.

Novel non-contacting evaluation technique is required because the transducer should be contacted on the CFRP in conventional ultrasonic technique during the non-destructive evaluation and these conventional contact techniques can not be applied in a novel fiber placement system.

40|$|Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) {{is one of}} {{the main}} methods used to join {{structural}} members. One of the largest challenges involved in production of welds is ensuring the quality of the weld. One of the main factors attributing to weld quality is penetration depth. Automatic control of the welding process requires non-contact, non-destructive sensors that can operate in the presence of high temperatures and electrical noise found in the welding environment. Inspection using laser generation and electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> <b>ultrasound</b> was found to satisfy these conditions. Using this technique, the time of flight of the ultrasonic wave is measured and used to calculate penetration depth. Previous works have shown that penetration depth measurement performance is drastically reduced when performed during welding. This work seeks to realize in-process penetration depth measurement by compensating for errors caused by elevated temperature. Neuro-fuzzy models are developed that predict penetration depth based on in-process time of flight measurements and the welding process input. Two scenarios are considered in which destructive penetration depth measurements are or are not available for model training. Results show the two scenarios are successful. When destructive measurements are unavailable, model error is comparable to that of offline ultrasonic measurements. When destructive measurements are available, measurement error is reduced by 50 % compared to offline ultrasonic measurements. The two models can be effectively applied to permit in-process penetration depth measurements for the purpose of real-time monitoring and control. This will reduce material, production time, and labor costs and increase the quality of welded parts. Ph. D.

40|$|The {{influence}} of highly regular, anisotropic, microstructured materials on high frequency ultrasonic wave propagation {{was investigated in}} this work. Microstructure, often only treated {{as a source of}} scattering, significantly influences high frequency ultrasonic waves, resulting in unexpected guided wave modes. Tissues, such as skin or muscle, are treated as homogeneous by current medical ultrasound systems, but actually consist of highly anisotropic micron-sized fibres. As these systems increase towards 100 MHz, these fibres will significantly influence propagating waves leading to guided wave modes. The effect of these modes on image quality must be considered. However, before studies can be undertaken on fibrous tissues, wave propagation in more ideal structures must be first understood. After the construction of a suitable high frequency ultrasound experimental system, finite element modelling and experimental characterisation of high frequency (20 - 200 MHz) ultrasonic waves in ideal, collinear, nanostructured alumina was carried out. These results revealed interesting waveguiding phenomena, and also identified the potential and significant advantages of using a microstructured material as an alternative acoustic matching layer in ultrasonic transducer design. Tailorable acoustic impedances were achieved from 4 - 17 MRayl, covering the impedance range of 7 - 12 MRayl most commonly required by transducer matching layers. Attenuation coefficients as low as 3. 5 dBmm- 1 were measured at 100 MHz, which is excellent when compared with 500 dBmm- 1 that was measured for a state of the art loaded epoxy matching layer at the same frequency. <b>Reception</b> <b>of</b> <b>ultrasound</b> without the restriction of critical angles was also achieved, and no dispersion was observed in these structures (unlike current matching layers) until at least 200 MHz. In addition, to make a significant step forward towards high frequency tissue characterisation, novel microstructured poly(vinyl alcohol) tissue-mimicking phantoms were also developed. These phantoms possessed acoustic and microstructural properties representative of fibrous tissues, much more realistic than currently used homogeneous phantoms. The attenuation coefficient measured along the direction of PVA alignment in an example phantom was 8 dBmm- 1 at 30 MHz, in excellent agreement with healthy human myocardium. This method will allow the fabrication of more realistic and repeatable phantoms for future high frequency tissue characterisation studies...|$|E
40|$|Chikayoshi SumiDepartment of Information and Communication Sciences, Faculty of Science and Technology, Sophia University, Tokyo, JapanAbstract: A {{number of}} {{ultrasonic}} displacement/velocity measurement {{methods have been}} extensively developed for measurements of blood flow, tissue motion, and strain. Lateral modulation (LM) methods have also been reported using steered, crossed beams, and these methods permit measurements of displacement vectors. In this report, a new beam steering method for the transmission and <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> <b>ultrasound</b> is proposed, which can enable measurements of lateral displacements and of arbitrary displacement vectors with a very high degree of accuracy. Because this beam steering method uses only a steering angle, this method {{is referred to as}} ASTA. With ASTA, the number of available methods to obtain a displacement vector measurement is limited to previously developed block-matching methods, such as the multidimensional cross-spectrum phase gradient method, and the multidimensional autocorrelation method (MAM) and the multidimensional Doppler method (MDM) using a block-matching method (the methods using block matching are referred to as MAMb and MDMb, respectively). Being dependent on the measurement method, only a lateral displacement measurement can be made even if the methods are multidimensional, ie, previously developed MAM and MDM using a moving average and a mirror setting of the obtained steered beams, and one-dimensional (1 D), such as an autocorrelation method. Considerations of beamforming schemes using LM and ASTA show that the simple ASTA beamforming method increases capabilities for real-time measurements and requires a small physical aperture when compared with LM. For lateral displacement measurements (eg, blood flow in a carotid artery), a lateral coordinate must correspond to the direction of the target&rsquo;s lateral motion, and the steering angle used is as large as possible to increase the measurement accuracy of a lateral displacement. However, for displacement vector measurements to describe complex tissue motions (eg, cardiac motion), if the axial coordinate corresponds to the depth direction in the target tissue, an ideal steering angle will be 45 &deg;. A two-dimensional echo simulation shows that for the block-matching methods, LM yields more accurate displacement vector measurements than ASTA, whereas with MAM and MDM using a moving average and a mirror setting and 1 D methods, ASTA yields more accurate lateral displacement measurements than LM. The block-matching method requires fewer calculations than the moving average method; however, a lower degree of accuracy is obtained. As with LM, multidimensional measurement methods yield more accurate measurements with ASTA than the corresponding 1 D measurement methods. Summarizing, for displacement vector measurements or lateral displacement measurements using the multidimensional measurement methods, the ranking of the degree of measurement accuracy and stability is ASTA with a mirror setting &gt; LM with a moving average &gt; LM with block matching &gt; ASTA with block matching. Because every tissue has its own motion (heart, liver, etc) and occasionally obstacles, such as bones, interfere with the measurements, the target tissue will determine the selection of the proper beamforming method with a choice between LM and ASTA. As for use with LM previously clarified, an appropriate displacement measurement method should also be selected for use with ASTA according to the echo signal-to-noise ratio, a required spatial resolution and a required calculation speed. ASTA, together with LM, can potentially enable the utilization of new aspects of displacement measurements.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{building blocks}} and strategies {{to reach the}} goal of a thumb-size autonomous ultrasound measurement system with wireless communication capabilities. The design of modern electronics is based on the possibility to accurately predict system behavior by the use of simulation tools. This paradigm can be extended to components such as sensors attached to the electronics. The ability to simulate mechanical components and electronics together renders possible effective optimization at system level, i. e. minimizing size, cost and power consumption. All of these parameters are important for measurement systems aiming at the rapidly growing field of sensor networking and ambient intelligence. The work in this thesis connects the mechanics of piezoelectric transducers with the design of on-chip microelectronics. Throughout the work, SPICE models of the ultrasound system are used within the design tool for integrated circuits. Improvements and verifications of existing SPICE models for ultrasound equipment is described and applied in the design of integrated electronics for an ultrasound measurement system. The overall aim has been to achieve minimal system size and power consumption through interdisciplinary work based on knowledge within both ultrasonics and electronics. The thesis is divided into introductional chapters and eight attached papers. The introductional chapters give an overview of ultrasound devices, measurement technology, and simulation models. Tools and design flow for analog and mixed signal integrated circuits are discussed. Finally, an overview of the electronics in a pulse-echo ultrasound system is given. The attached papers cover various topics required to reach the goals presented above. The first three papers are closely related to the SPICE models of the piezoelectric devices and the ultrasound propagation media. First, a design strategy towards an area optimized driver stage for piezoelectric crystals with the help of SPICE simulations is presented. A prototype chip design has been made and it is shown that simulations and measured performance agree well. Second, diffraction loss for ultrasound pulses is included in the SPICE models for the ultrasound propagation medium. It is shown that this enables accurate simulations of absolute amplitudes in a pulse-echo ultrasound system with its associated electronics. Third, the influence of parasitic components stemming from cabling in the system are simulated and shown to agree well with measured data. Analog to digital converters and comparators are useful components in a pulse echo ultrasound system. The design of these blocks with focus on low power consumption is presented in two papers. The fourth paper presents a low power, high resolution sigma delta A/D converter, while the fifth paper introduces the deign of a delay-time stable time-continuous comparator suitable for use in time quantization A/D converters. The last three papers address three aspects of system level design of the ultrasound measurement system. The sixth paper presents the mounting of the electronics chip directly onto the piezoelectric crystal using wire bond technology. The setup enables precise pulse control and results in a very compact design. The seventh paper discusses the design of a complete embedded internet system (EIS) confined in the space 25 x 23 x 5 mm^ 3. The system incorporates an integrated web server, Bluetooth communication, and TCP/IP stack and is intended to serve as a base for Internet connected sensors.

The chip is designed in a high voltage process, and incorporates an inductive boost pump to achieve a high voltage for the excitation of the crystal.

A challenge for future research {{is to improve the}} efficiency <b>of</b> <b>ultrasound</b> to produce a large number of nuclei for start-up of batch crystallization at larger scale.

30|$|We {{find that}} a {{disruptive}} innovation process is happening. This new knowledge allows us to put forward advice for the stakeholders in the field <b>of</b> <b>ultrasound.</b> It also allows us to challenge the conventional pyramid of expertise used to describe different types <b>of</b> <b>ultrasound.</b> The perspective <b>of</b> this paper is mutual understanding of {{similarities and differences between}} conventional and point-of-care ultrasound. Only with this understanding the stakeholders can collaborate and use the full spectrum <b>of</b> <b>ultrasound</b> {{for the benefit of the}} patient.|$|R
