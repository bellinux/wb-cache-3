5000|$|Edward Gelsthorpe (June 14, 1921 [...] - [...] September 12, 2009) was an American {{marketing}} executive. He {{used his}} creative skills to build markets for new {{products such as}} Ban <b>roll-on</b> <b>deodorant</b> at Bristol-Myers, Cran-Apple juice for the Ocean Spray cooperative, and Manwich canned sloppy joe sauce for Hunt-Wesson.|$|E
50|$|She {{appeared}} {{frequently on}} Sesame Street in comedy sketch clips from her six years on that show, {{and is often}} heard {{as the voice of}} outlandish failed torch singer Suzie Kabloozie. While she was a regular performer on Sesame Street, she was nominated for an Emmy Award for her work as Ruthie, a shopkeeper. Buzzi performed in numerous national television commercials, most notably for Clorox 2, Clairol, Ban <b>roll-on</b> <b>deodorant,</b> and Santa Anita Raceway, and voicing Granny Goodwitch in television commercials for Sugar Crisp cereal. She originated the Goodwitch character in the animated TV series Linus! The Lion Hearted (1964-65).|$|E
5000|$|During {{the early}} 1900s, makeup was not {{excessively}} popular. In fact, women hardly wore makeup at all. Make-up {{at this time}} was still mostly the territory of ladies of the night, those in cabarets and on the black & white screen. Face enamelling (applying actual paint to the face) became popular among the rich {{at this time in}} an attempt to look paler. This practice was dangerous due to the main ingredient often being arsenic. [...] Pale skin was associated with wealth because it meant you were not out working in the sun and could afford to stay inside all day. Cosmetics were so unpopular that they could not be bought in department stores; they could only be bought at theatrical costume stores. A woman’s [...] "makeup routine" [...] often only consisted of using papier poudré, a powdered paper/oil blotting sheet, to whiten the nose in the winter and shine their cheeks in the summer. Rouge was considered provocative, so was only seen on [...] "women of the night." [...] Some women used burnt matchsticks to darken eyelashes, and geranium and poppy petals to stain the lips. [...] Vaseline became high in demand because it was used on chapped lips, as a base for hair tonic, and soap. [...] Toilet waters were introduced in the early 1900s, but only lavender water or refined cologne was admissible for women to wear. [...] Cosmetic deodorant was invented in 1888, by an unknown inventor from Philadelphia and was trademarked under the name Mum (deodorant). <b>Roll-on</b> <b>deodorant</b> was launched in 1952, and aerosol deodorant in 1965.|$|E
50|$|The first Fa product, a new bar soap, talc powders was {{launched}} in 1954 by Henkel-subsidiary Dreiring. In 1975, Henkel's first Fa-shower gel was introduced. Fa products were since then joined by new series of bar soaps, liquid soaps, shower gels, bubble baths, <b>roll-on</b> <b>deodorants,</b> stick deodorants and deosprays. As of today, Fa is marketed in some 120 countries.|$|R
40|$|Axillary {{dermatitis}} {{is common}} and overrepresented {{in people with}} contact allergy to fragrances. Many people suspect their deodorants to be the incriminating products. In order to investigate the significance of isoeugenol in deodorants {{for the development of}} axillary dermatitis when used by people with and without contact allergy to isoeugenol, patch tests with deodorants and ethanol solutions with isoeugenol, as well as repeated open application tests (ROAT) with <b>roll-on</b> <b>deodorants</b> with and without isoeugenol at various concentrations, were performed in 35 dermatitis patients, 10 without and 25 with contact allergy to isoeugenol. A positive ROAT was observed only in patients hypersensitive to isoeugenol (P< 0. 001) and only in the axilla to which the deodorants containing isoeugenol had been applied (P< 0. 001). Deodorants containing isoeugenol in the concentration range of 0. 0063 - 0. 2 % used 2 times daily on healthy skin can thus elicit axillary dermatitis within a few weeks in people with contact allergy to isoeugenol. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Axillary {{dermatitis}} is {{a common}} problem, particularly in individuals with contact allergy to fragrances. Many individuals suspect their deodorant to be the causal product of their fragrance allergy. It {{has been shown that}} deodorants containing cinnamic aldehyde (cinnamal) can elicit axillary dermatitis in patients sensitized to this substance. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the importance of hydroxycitronellal used in deodorants for the development of axillary dermatitis, when applied by individuals with and without contact allergy to this fragrance chemical. Patch tests with deodorants and ethanolic solutions containing hydroxycitronellal, as well as repeated open application tests (ROAT) with <b>roll-on</b> <b>deodorants</b> with and without hydroxycitronellal at different concentrations, were performed in 14 dermatitis patients, 7 with and 7 without contact allergy to hydroxycitronellal. A positive ROAT was noted only in the patients hypersensitive to hydroxycitronellal (P < 0. 001) and only in the axilla to which the deodorants containing hydroxycitronellal had been applied (P < 0. 001). Deodorants containing hydroxycitronellal in the concentration range of 0. 032 - 0. 32 % used twice daily on healthy skin in individuals hypersensitive to hydroxycitronellal can elicit axillary dermatitis in a few weeks. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|Cuts from shaving can bleed {{for about}} fifteen minutes. Shaving cuts {{can be caused}} by blade {{movement}} perpendicular to the blade's cutting axis or by regular / orthogonal shaving over prominent bumps on the skin (which the blade incises). As such, the presence of acne can make shaving cuts more likely, and extra care must be exercised. The use of a fresh, sharp blade as well as proper cleaning and lubrication of skin can help prevent cuts. Common methods used to stop shaving-induced bleeding include: (1) pressing any simple alcohol onto the cut until the bleeding stops (e.g. with a cotton swab); (2) placing a small piece of tissue or toilet paper onto the cut; (3) applying styptic pencils and styptic liquids; (4) placing a small amount of petroleum jelly on the cut after most of the bleeding has ended (which can stop the bleeding without forming a scab), or (5) applying a small amount of aluminum chlorohydrate (commonly found in <b>roll-on</b> <b>deodorants</b> such as Ban). Shaving in or just after a cold shower can help prevent bleeding as well, because blood flow to the skin is reduced in these conditions because of vasoconstriction caused by the cold water. Shaving blade disposal in the era of safety razors and double-edged blades was a concern for a man's spouse and children who could easily take a blade, casually cast into the garbage, and in the process of compressing or compacting the garbage, cut themselves seriously. Some razor blade manufacturers include disposal containers or receptacles to avoid injuries.|$|R
40|$|Aluminium is {{the third}} most {{frequent}} element in the earth's crust and occurs naturally in drinking water and other foods, particularly in fruit and vegetables. For consumers the main uptake route is food. There may be additional exposure from aluminium-containing food-contact articles like kitchen utensils, cans, foils or tubes from which the light metal migrates into the food. Furthermore, aluminium may also be contained in medicinal products to neutralise gastric acid, so-called antacids and in cosmetic products. In <b>roll-on</b> <b>deodorants,</b> for instance, it is used for its antiperspirant action. Dietary aluminium has a low toxicity. The substance and its compounds are poorly soluble at neutral pH. However, solubility increases considerably {{in the presence of}} acids and salts. The safety of aluminium uptake from food-contact articles and cosmetic products is repeatedly questioned. This applies in particular to its possible involvement in the development of Alzheimer's disease, a form of dementia that may be linked to elevated aluminium concentrations in the cerebral regions affected. Compared to uptake from food or antacids, aluminium intake from food-contact articles and cosmetic products is low. It is far lower than the intake which is deemed to be safe on the basis of an updated assessment of the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Health Organisation (JEFCA, 2006). So far no causal relationship has been proven scientifically between elevated aluminium uptake from foods including drinking water, medicinal products or cosmetics and Alzheimer's disease. Concerning the increased solubility of aluminium in the presence of acids and salts, BfR recommends that no aluminium-containing pans or bowls should be used for foods like apple puree, rhubarb, tomato puree or salted herring. No aluminium foil should be used in contact with these foods either. This is one way of actively avoiding unnecessary aluminium uptake...|$|R
