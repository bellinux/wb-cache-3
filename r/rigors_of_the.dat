Giselle is honored when the beautiful stranger offers her a necklace as a gift before the group of nobles depart.|$|E

Bibliographies were reviewed to identify other articles of interest, and experts were contacted about missing or unpublished studies.

5|$|Dominant bulls follow {{groups of}} cows during the rut, from August into early winter. A bull will defend his harem of 20 cows or more from {{competing}} bulls and predators. Only mature bulls have large harems and breeding success peaks at {{about eight years}} of age. Bulls between two and four years and over 11 years of age rarely have harems, and {{spend most of the}} rut on the periphery of larger harems. Young and old bulls that do acquire a harem hold it later in the breeding season than do bulls in their prime. A bull with a harem rarely feeds and he may lose up to 20 percent of his body weight. Bulls that enter the rut in poor condition are less likely to make it through to the peak conception period or have the strength to survive the <b>rigors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oncoming winter.|$|E

500|$|The party pressed onward on August 30, {{having no}} alternative. [...] In {{the heat of}} the day, the {{moisture}} underneath the salt crust rose to the surface and turned the soil to a gummy mass. [...] The wheels of their wagons sank into it, in some cases up to the hubs. [...] The days were blisteringly hot and the nights frigid. Several of the group saw visions of lakes and wagon trains, and believed that they had finally overtaken Hastings. After three days, the water was gone, and some of the party removed their oxen from the wagons to press ahead to find more. Some of the animals were so weakened they were left yoked to the wagons and abandoned. Nine of Reed's ten oxen broke free, crazed with thirst, and bolted off into the desert. Many other families' cattle and horses had also gone missing. The <b>rigors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> journey resulted in irreparable damage to some of the wagons, but no human lives had been lost.
