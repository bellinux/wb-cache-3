40|$|The {{analysis}} of business processes requires discussions between different project groups, within the respective project group, and between experts and {{managers in the}} enterprise and the project members. Therefore, the modelling of business processes is an essential {{step in the process}} of reorganising enterprises. <b>Reorganisation</b> <b>measures</b> are only possible if the existing or planned processes are known. The application of a modelling method should not only support single steps of factory planning. It has to guide and support the whole project. Therefore, it is necessary to reveal all aspects which are relevant to clarify weak points, to show potentials for optimisation and their contribution to the objectives of the enterprise. The article includes industrial experiments in modelling, workflow analysis, business process reengineering and optimisation using Integrated Enterprise Modelling (IEM) and MO’GO. IEM gives a transparent representation of planning information and is therefore the basis for discussion between project participants. To evaluate the variety of planning information and description requirements it allows different views on one consistent model. The software tool MO’GO (method of object oriented business process optimisationl supports the modelling process based on the IEM method. Different analyses of a given model are available using the MO’GO tool like the generation of ISO 9 ooOff documents...|$|E

Based on the data of the IAB establishment panel of 2001, representative findings concerning firms of all industries and establishment sizes are presented. The direct employment and qualification effects {{of the most important}} <b>reorganisation</b> <b>measure</b> implemented in the particular company are also analysed. The finding for the employment effects is not clear: there are individual reorganization measures that are more likely to result in a reduction in employment, others are more likely to lead to an increase in employment. The effects differ partly between {{the old and the new}} Länder. There are certain combinations of organizational changes for which clear employment effects can be determined. In addition, it became obvious that organizational changes are more likely to tend to result in an increase in the level of qualification within the company units affected by the reorganization measures. This result applies to both western and eastern German firms irrespective of the concrete measure.

40|$|Local {{government}} in Great Britain is currently undergoing reorganisation. The reorganisation process is being progressed separately {{in each of}} the three countries of Great Britain [...] England, Scotland, and Wales. Reorganisation itself has always been a sensitive issue, and the current process is no exception. Political implications of the process have often tended to cloud the practical implications for the delivery of local authority services. In this paper support by senior members of the planning profession in Wales for central government's <b>reorganisation</b> proposals is <b>measured.</b> The content of the proposals is examined and the principal planning-related issues that arise from them are identified. The paper highlights current debate on the implications of local government reorganisation for the future delivery and nature of planning in the principality, with particular reference to three key areas: planning in a unitary local government structure, the nature of strategic planning within a reorganised local government structure, and the role of community and town councils in the planning process. It is shown that despite general dissatisfaction with central government's regard for the planning function in its proposals for reorganisation, there is considerable support for the underlying principles and content of those proposals. The paper is concluded by progressing the debate to the form of local authority planning postreorganisation. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{demand for}} {{services}} in outpatient clinics in university hospitals increased steadily {{over the last}} years, in Austria and in other western countries. Although this development is caused inevitably by the efforts to reduce inpatient care, the hospital owners are interested – because of poor cost coverage, to reduce outpatient services. At the same time outpatient services play an important strategic role in recruiting patients for research and for medical training purposes or for covering highly specialised medical fields in order to strengthen the market position of the respective hospital. Research question: The need for positioning {{as much as the}} economic necessity to tighten the health services offered led to the question of: How can the services of outpatient clinics of university hospitals be defined in contrast to health care services offered by specialised physicians and/or outpatient clinics in peripheral hospitals? Methods: a) A literature search identified only 34 relevant publications on ‚strategic positioning, spectrum of services, function, documentation and quantification of care/ medical training & teaching/ research, patient access, resource use, appropriateness’ in the setting of outpatient clinics in university hospitals. A systematic literature review complemented by a survey of the management of university hospitals, summarizes the state of the discussion. b) A methodology to empirically analyse the data on the performed services was developed as a prototype and probed. c) A matrix for systematically categorising the performed services according to their ‘depth of care’ was developed. Results of literature review: The discussion on the role of outpatient clinics in university hospitals is dominated by economic arguments. The corner stones of the debate are: - Debate on structural reforms: In Austria and Germany the role of outpatient clinics is almost always debated as part of structural reforms and the containment of inefficiencies. In the USA structural <b>reorganisation</b> and <b>measures</b> to increase efficiencies are taken to face the strong competition of Managed Care Organisations. In Great Britain outpatient clinics of hospitals play – due to the low density of specialised physicians – a different, but important role. Additionally in the Netherlands and Great Britain the non-medical ‚Health Care Professionals’ are given {{an important role in the}} patient care in outpatient-setting. - Medical training and research: The relevance of outpatient clinics for medical training is emphasised repeatedly, while rather little time is actually devoted to teaching activities. Research activities seem to be of no importance. - Patients frequenting outpatient clinic are – tend to have a lower socioeconomic status and are – to a higher extent – responsible for the increasing number of unplanned patient contacts. Only a small part of patient sent to the outpatient clinic by other physicians are clinically indicated. The diagnostic potentials in university hospitals is considered to be the reason for patient assignments, which could be reduced by better training of the assigning physicians. - Hospital-operators: outpatient clinics in University hospitals are – if considered isolated - cost drivers, but considered systemically - they can generate profit. Approaches reform the utilisation of outpatient resources are outcome-related resource allocation according to agreement of objectives, process optimisation and the active implementation of regulatory instruments for patient access. - Documentation of performance: in the context of the mostly general debate and the lack of empirical materials on actual outpatient clinic activities, the ‘German research on outpatient clinics’ performed (‘Deutsche Hochschul-Ambulanzenstudie’) pioneer work by comprising and analysing outpatient clinic data for the first time. Results of development of methodology: - Development of a prototype for analysing outpatient performance data: the profiles (pattern of services and consecutive trails) of three different groups of patients determining the profile of the delivered services, were defined: 1.) complex and interdisciplinary cases/ patients vs. noncomplex cases; 2.) emergency-patients vs. non-emergency-patients; 3.) pre- and post inpatient cases and their consequential examinations and therapies, even if those medical services are necessarily complex. - Development of a matrix for systematically categorising the performed services according to their ‘depth of care’, which was defined by 1.) technical input/ infrastructural need; 2.) complexity/ interdisciplinarity; 3.) specialisation/ low incidence/ rareness/ risk. This definition served for operationalisation for differentiation of medical services that only can be offered in university clinics and such that can be offered in other settings (in group- practices or specialised physicians). Conclusion: Emergency care as much as the care for pre- and post-inpatients is out of question under the current circumstances. The generation of a profile for outpatient services in university hospitals has to be realigned along the following key elements: - Clinical factors determining the range of services offered defined by infrastructural need; complexity/ interdisciplinarity; rareness of indication and according need for specialisation. - Factors determining the needs in medical teaching and research, are led by the need for ‚average’ patients and the need for training in unspecific diseases. Here only the extent/the minimum number of „average“ patients is under question. - Alternative low threshold institutions for extramural care esp. for those socially disadvantaged that more frequently attend outpatient clinics than specialised physicians. - Economic rationalities, that show that esp. the care for non-complex patients takes disproportionately more resources - because of additional diagnostic and therapeutic input - than in other settings...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{economic}} motives for and personnel-management consequences {{of reducing the}} number of hierarchical levels {{from the point of view}} of fairness aspects. A transition to flat hierarchies can, under certain circumstances, have serious consequences for employees who are directly or indirectly affected; these consequences include a loss of status and/or income, reduced chances of promotion and thus diminished career prospects. In particular well-qualified employees could respond to this by moving to other firms, whilst repercussions can be expected regarding the motivation and work effort of the remaining employees. It can therefore be crucial for the success of a firm that the employees accept their treatment in the course of <b>reorganisation</b> <b>measures</b> and assess it to be fair. A written survey conducted among students is to provide first information as to the acceptance of hierarchical levels being eliminated and the associated consequences for the employees. Special emphasis is placed here on the significance of various motives for delayering and different personnel-management measures for the assessment of fairness. One key finding is that reciprocity norms have a decisive influence on the perceived fairness of a restructuring measure. In particular, disadvantages resulting from a delayering of the hierarchy are apparently more likely to be accepted if they are associated with adequate compensation from the viewpoint of the employees affected.

40|$|South African {{small to}} medium sized {{entities}} are {{the bread and}} butter of our economy. Providing much-needed employment and developing skills both formally and informally to historically disadvantaged persons {{are some of the}} most significant benefits of small to medium sized entities in a developing country such as South Africa. Unfortunately, despite these highly celebrated significant contributions to the socio-economic development of the country, South African small to medium sized entities have the lowest survival rates in the world, resulting in high rates of business failure and job losses created by these entities. The Companies Act 71 of 2008 provides for a corporate rescue system in the form of business rescue and a compromise between a company and its creditors which replaces judicial management as a corporate rescue procedure for South African companies. Business rescue provides companies in financial distress with opportunities to reorganise, strategize and come up with useful corporate <b>reorganisation</b> <b>measures</b> which are useful and efficient in saving the financially distressed company and possibly yielding a better return for the creditors than would have been the case if the company was liquidated. This study analyses whether the overall South African corporate rescue systems, past and present, have developed in line with the needs and interests of South African Small to medium-sized entities, in a manner that is efficient and sensitive to the inherent weakness of our economy as well as the distinctive needs of small to medium sized entities. A comparative study with similar procedures in the United Kingdom and the United States of America is undertaken to determine whether the evolution of South African corporate rescue laws meets the needs and interests of small- to medium-sized entities in the modern South African economy. Several inherent weakness are identified in the new business rescue regime as well as in compromises between a company and its creditors and a number of recommendations are made to improve the current provisions in the Act, for the purpose of making access and use of these corporate rescue procedures less burdensome and accessible for small- to medium- sized entities. This is done with the purpose of assisting the South African legislature in developing a corporate rescue procedure tailor-made for South African companies and not a mere cut and paste corporate rescue system unfitting to the needs and interests of South African small- to medium-sized entities...|$|E
