50|$|Easytrade is {{an example}} of the 4-Corner Model for {{interoperability}} between service providers. This model is best known from the telephony industry where Telco-operators interoperate by <b>roaming</b> <b>traffic</b> between each other. The advantage of this model is that any party in a transaction can switch provider seamlessly without having to notify the other parties with whom they exchange business documents.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the year}} 2000 GSM {{operators}} {{have been using}} GRX (GPRS Roaming Exchange) network for routing the IP based commercial <b>roaming</b> <b>traffic</b> between visited and home operators. Mainly 2.5G and 3G data roaming has been using GRX. GRX is a private IP network (separated from the internet) consisting of multiple different GRX carriers that are connected to each other via peering points. However, GRX is limited only to GSM operator community and not all GRX's are capable of meeting the demands of real-time services.|$|E
40|$|Due to pricing {{policies}} set by network operators, roaming clients {{are among the}} most valuable clients of GSM cellular networks. Despite that each operator applies a lot of effort in network signal coverage in order to achieve the best conditions for <b>roaming</b> <b>traffic</b> in the network, there still remain hardly detectable locations where roaming clients are getting lost to rival networks. This paper presents a method for revealing <b>roaming</b> <b>traffic</b> weak locations, based on active tracking of roamers in a live GSM network. We define the problem scope using formal description of the active tracking process and propose a metric for evaluating network “weakness”, together with intuitive visualization of weak locations. We shortly conclude with plans for ongoing research...|$|E
50|$|The {{first is}} an End to End Billing Verification service, {{which is used}} as a form of {{monitoring}} and provides an international network of test robots. These are deployed and operated remotely by Araxxe. One example of this was based on <b>roaming</b> telecommunication <b>traffic</b> in South Africa, prior to the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Additional robots were deployed to check the billing of clients who were attending the competition, in order to minimise fraud.|$|R
40|$|High {{international}} roaming prices have puzzled and occupied analysts and regulators {{for quite a}} time. While on the retail side the problem seems to be well understood, and the high margins can be justified using Ramsey pricing logic, on the wholesale side the picture is not so clear. Recent contributions find reasons for regulation based {{on the existence of}} random traffic and on the bilateral nature of the wholesale deals, which raise the equilibrium prices even when operators can choose a preferred network. This paper intends to investigate whether or not those concerns are justified. This is done by modelling the bilateral roaming negotiations and extending the current models, assuming that home operators (the ones with a retail contract with the customer in its country of residence) can decide not only their preferred network in each visited country, but also the distribution of their outbound traffic among the visited operators. We find that when traffic steering is perfect the wholesale market is competitive, and that the lower prices are passed on to end users through competition for retail customers. The bilateral nature of {{international roaming}} wholesale deals is actually an additional source of competition on the retail market for mobile services because the <b>roaming</b> out <b>traffic</b> (the traffic of an operator's retail customers abroad) and the <b>roaming</b> in <b>traffic</b> (the traffic of foreign customers that an operator is able to attract) are directly linked.

For example, Yap et al.[128] have proposed supporting diverse wireless technologies using the OpenFlow protocol in the OpenFlow Wireless project. SDN {{can also be used to}} coexistence of diverse technology through the support of mobile offloading, or Wi-Fi <b>roaming,</b> using which <b>traffic</b> from a mobile cellular network is outsourced to a Wi-Fi data network to improve the quality-of-experience (QoE) of the end user.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} four network {{interconnection}} scenarios {{and the related}} signaling aspects for the international <b>roaming</b> <b>traffic</b> in mobile and personal communications. With or without international gateway relay nodes summarized from the proposed scenarios, we also derive three international roaming network sets {IR 1, IR 2, IR 3 } for the observed signaling traffic model with two-level databases. Based on the proposed performance metrics, analysis results show that under some reasonable assumptions the signaling traffic of international roaming is significantly impacted by the related gateway relay nodes and databases. In addition, the studied cache data management strategy at VLR can reduce the impacts of the signaling traffic of query operation, but the caching approach cannot improve the performance of update operation. Furthermore, the performance of proposed standalone STP scenario is better than that of integrated STP scenario for the international network connection. 1...|$|E
40|$|During {{the year}} to end-January 2005, the {{resurgence}} of takeover activity in the mobile telecommunications industry 1 has attracted media attention. However, by focusing on takeovers, the willingness of companies in the sector to collaborate through alliance and joint venture formation {{is in danger of}} being overlooked. These alliances, none of which are more than two years old, can be variously interpreted. They could signify a return to expansionary behaviour by operators motivated by the desire to capture lucrative <b>roaming</b> <b>traffic</b> or retain key customers. Alternatively the alliances may be motivated by the desire to compete more effectively with Vodafone, which is arguably the only mobile operator with a global footprint. This paper is structured as follows. In the initial section, the six alliances that have been formed are described. Particular attention is paid to the membership and resulting scale of these alliances, {{as well as to the}} motives for their formation. The first sub-section focuses on those alliances that are largely scale orientated in motivation, while the second concentrates on those that are more technologically orientated. These alliances are then discussed in detail and conclusions are drawn...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – In {{this paper}} we discuss the issues of {{wireless}} mobile networks for intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and examine several available technologies. Furthermore, we propose a design of secure transparent mobile IP to provide broadband ITS services over wireless LAN that improves upon security, transparency and handoff of mobile IP. The proposed design adopts a tunnel-in-tunnel mechanism for secure mobile network systems. It includes a direct registration method to support transparent registration and fast handoff, and a VPN-based access control to provide secure user <b>roaming</b> and <b>traffic</b> protection. Single sign-on is also developed to keep authenticated VPN sessions and mobile nodes connected even the attachment to Internet has changed. The protocol analysis and the preliminary experiment show that our design not only supports transparency and security for mobile IP, {{but it can also}} significantly reduce both the latency and the number of control messages incurred by handoff...|$|R
40|$|The cost of {{wireless}} network highly {{depends on the}} power consumption for transmission. The power consumption increases as number of users increase. Nonlinear enhancement of cost with increase in power needs the attention and optimization. The base station sharing is identified as the most efficient solution to reduce energy consumption costs of cellular networks. In this project, a scheme has been proposed {{which is based on}} framework for the study of such cooperative solutions where different mobile network operators (MNOs) decide to switch OFF subsets of their base stations during off-peak hours and <b>roam</b> their <b>traffic</b> to the remaining stations. The genetic algorithm has been used in this project to identify the traffic threshold for switching off the base station depending on the data available. The fitness function consider the cost of power consumption and roming cost simultateously. The improvement with GA based optimization has given in the result section. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—De{{registration}} {{due to the}} departures {{of mobile}} users from their current visiting registration area may cause significant traffic in the wireless cellular networks. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical implicit deregistration scheme with forced registration in third-generation wireless cellular networks to reduce the remote/international <b>roaming</b> signaling <b>traffic</b> when home-location registers (HLRs), gateway-location registers (GLRs), and the visitor-location registers (VLRs) form a three-level database hierarchy. In this scheme, if a mobile phone arrives and the GLR/VLR is full, a random record is deleted and the reclaimed storage is reassigned to the new arriving mobile phone. When a call arrives and the callee’s record is missing in the GLR/VLR, forced registration is executed to restore the GLR/VLR record before the call-setup operation proceeds. An analytic model is proposed {{to carry out the}} performance evaluation for the proposed scheme. Our results show that the proposed scheme not only reduces the local deregistration traffic between the GLR an...|$|R
40|$|Mobile robots such as {{automated}} guided vehicles {{become increasingly}} important in industry as they can greatly increase efficiency. For their operation such robots must rely on wireless communication, typically realized by connecting them to an existing enterprise network. In this paper we motivate that such an approach is not always economically viable or might result in performance issues. Therefore we propose a flexible and configurable mixed architecture that leverages on mesh capabilities whenever appropriate. Through experiments on a wireless testbed {{for a variety of}} scenarios, we analyse the impact of <b>roaming,</b> mobility and <b>traffic</b> separation and demonstrate the potential of our approach...|$|R
40|$|Network {{infrastructure}} {{sharing and}} base station switching off mechanisms have been recently introduced as promising solutions toward energy and cost reduction in cellular networks. Although these techniques are usually studied independently, their combination offers new alternatives to MNOs for serving their users and could potentially {{provide them with}} additional benefits. In this article we introduce the concept of intra-cell roaming-based infrastructure sharing, where the MNOs may switch off their BSs and <b>roam</b> their <b>traffic</b> to active BSs operated by other MNOs in the same cell. Motivated by the coexistence of multiple operators in the same area, we present possible network deployments and architectures in current and future cellular scenarios, discussing their particular characteristics. In addition, we propose an innovative distributed game theoretic BS switching off scheme, employing an integrated cost function {{that takes into account}} all the different cases for a given operator to serve its own traffic (i. e. through active BSs of neighboring cells or exploiting intra-cell roaming-based infrastructure sharing). Finally, we demonstrate some indicative simulation results in realistic scenarios to quantify the potential energy and financial benefits that our proposed scheme offers to the MNOs in multi-operator environments, providing them with the necessary incentives to participate in the infrastructure sharing...|$|R
40|$|Network {{attacks and}} cyber-security {{breaches}} {{may be the}} cause of huge monetary damages in the modern information-based economy; thus, the need for network security is stronger than ever as it is the need for full traffic sanitization. Nonetheless, the purge of malicious packets is still too often relegated to the destination of the attacks letting the unwanted <b>traffic</b> <b>roam</b> freely. At the same time, the next generation of routers promises to be able to modulate energy consumption on the basis of actual traffic, thus the presence of malicious traffic in the network is a cause of economic losses in itself, even when the attack is not successful. In past work, we modelled and analysed the energy savings enabled by aggressive intrusion detection; however, fluctuations in the traffic intensity has not been fully taken into account. In this article, we introduce a new enhanced adaptive model that takes into full account the actual load of routers including what is due to forecasting errors...|$|R
40|$|The {{proliferation}} of wideband connections while opening {{the market to}} a wealth of new web based applications has also provided a pervasive set of injection points for malicious network traffic. This fact has generated a new storm of network attacks that every day generates a non negligible amount of network traffic. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) aim at preventing the delivery of malicious traffic to targeted systems thus preventing damage at the end point of the attack, however they are positioned either on a single host or on very peripheral routers, thus they do not provide any help in {{reducing the amount of}} malicious <b>traffic</b> <b>roaming</b> the network. The sheer amount of traffic to be analyzed prevents any attempt to move intrusion detection to core routers, however Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems (DIDS) may provide a solution. In past works DIDS have been envisioned as cooperative clusters of traditional IDS, in this paper we present a novel methodology that allows distributing the computational load of intrusion detection on several nodes thus allowing to empower the network itself of intrusion detection and prevention capabilities...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel Connection Admission Control (CAC) strategy for vehicular DVB-RCS satellite networks. Using estimations of arriving and departing traffic in each spot-beam our proposal aims to maximize user satisfaction and minimize {{at the same}} time resource reservation. Via GPS measurements, terminals periodically estimate their time to handoff and encapsulate mobility information within signaling bursts. Upon reception of a mobility update, the NCC (Network Control Centre) is able to estimate the amount of <b>traffic</b> <b>roaming</b> around the spot-beams as well as the probabilities that active terminals will eventually handoff. As a consequence, the NCC reserves only the necessary amount of resources for handover purposes in each spot-beam in order to minimize the percentage of connections forced to termination. No overhead is introduced for the implementation of our CAC solution as it makes use of the existing DVB-RCS signaling for providing the NCC with the extra mobility parameters driving the admission control module. Through an accurate ns- 2 modeling of existing DVB-RCS signaling mechanisms, we demonstrate that our lightweight CAC scheme outperforms static channel reservation schemes in terms of handover failure rate as well as traffic prediction strategies using mobility information in terms of channel utilization...|$|R

The family tracks down the couple and reaches Chennai to meet them. But the family members pretend as if they had agreed for the wedding and convince them to return to Madurai along with them. On the way back to Madurai, the family members take the couple to their farmland where Aishwarya's relatives have gathered. They all beat Murugan and Aishwarya's father wants her to remove the mangalyam tied by Murugan. Aishwarya fears that if she does not obey her father, then Murugan will be killed and also Aishwarya agrees to marry another man to save Murugan's life. Murugan is heavily beaten and let go from the place.
