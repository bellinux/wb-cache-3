5|$|In 1963, as mass {{civil disobedience}} broke out due to discontent from the Buddhist {{majority}} over Diệm's pro-Catholic discrimination, {{sparked by the}} fatal shootings of nine people who were demonstrating against the ban on the Buddhist flag. The US began to lose confidence in Diệm's ability to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> effectively and prevent {{the growth of the}} communist insurgency, and concluded that he was an obstacle to religious and thus national stability. During this time, the American press corps wrote unvarnished stories about the South Vietnamese government's policies and actions, in contrast to the supportive pieces of the 1950s, and Diệm's attempt to physically intimidate correspondents backfired. After Diệm tried to settle the Buddhist crisis by launching synchronized raids on Buddhist temples across the country to round up those monks who were leading protests against him, the Americans began to look for alternative leadership, sending Cable 243 to their embassy in Saigon to authorise the search for someone to replace Diệm. In November 1963, Diệm was overthrown in a US-backed coup and he and Nhu were captured and executed.|$|E
5|$|On 16 April, an agreement, which {{intentionally}} excluded PAIGC, {{was reached}} with 22 of the 35 opposition parties {{to set up}} a National Transitional Council. According to Vaz, the size, composition and mandate period would be determined the following day and then discussed with the Military Command.

The former committee was due to meet the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) the following day. The transitional civilian government will rule up to two years before new elections will be held. National Assembly speaker Manuel Serifo Nhamadjo, who had previously rejected the office of interim president in April 2012, was again selected as interim president on 11 May 2012. Sory Djaló was the speaker of the NTC.|$|E

25|$|With Solano López on the <b>run,</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> {{lacked a}} government. Pedro II sent his Foreign {{minister}} José Paranhos to Asunción where he arrived on February 20, 1869, and began consultations {{with the local}} politicians. On March 31 a petition was signed by 335 leading citizens asking the Allies for a provisional government. This was followed by negotiations between the Allied countries who put aside some of more controversial points of the Treaty of the Triple Alliance and on June 11 an agreement was reached with Paraguayan opposition figures that a three-man provisional government would be established. On July 22 a National Assembly met in the National Theatre and elected a Junta Nacional of 21 men, which then selected a five-man committee to select three men for the provisional government. They selected Carlos Loizaga, Juan Francisco Decoud, and José Díaz de Bedoya. Decoud was unacceptable to Paranhos, who had him replaced with Cirilo Antonio Rivarola. The government was finally installed on August 15, but was just a front for the continued Allied occupation.|$|E
25|$|Philosopher Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677), who {{regularly}} cited De la Court's works, described in his unfinished Tractatus Politicus (1677) how the ideal state, a democratic republic, should function. According to Spinoza, kings {{have a natural}} tendency to pursue their own personal interests, and entrust large portions of power to confidants (who lack any official mandate, but often de facto <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> if the king is a weakling). These confidants are often noblemen, making it an aristocracy instead of a monarchy in practice. The best monarchy is a quasi-monarchy, a crowned republic in which princes have as little power as possible. Spinoza proposes a council of state, elected by citizens, to take the most important decisions, and replace the murderous and pillaging royal mercenary armies by an unpaid draft army of citizens that defends its own country for self-preservation. If this council of state is large and representative enough, {{there will never be}} a majority in favour of war, because of all the suffering, destruction and high taxes it will cause.|$|E
25|$|Sir Humphrey represents, in many ways, {{the perfect}} technocrat. He is pompous, arrogant, elitist and regards his less-well-educated {{minister}} with some contempt. He frequently uses both his {{mastery of the}} English language and even his superb grasp of Latin and Greek grammar to perplex his political master and to obscure relevant issues under discussion. However, his habit of using language {{as a tool of}} confusion and obstruction is so deeply ingrained that he is sometimes unable to speak clearly and directly even in circumstances in which he honestly wishes to make himself clearly understood. He genuinely believes that the Civil Service knows what the average person needs and is the most qualified body to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> the joke being not only that Sir Humphrey, as a high-ranking Oxford-educated Civil Servant, is quite {{out of touch with the}} average person but also that the Civil Service judges what is 'best for Britain' to be that which in actuality is best for the Civil Service. Jim Hacker, on the other hand, tends to regard what is best for Britain as being whatever is best for his political party or his own chances of re-election. As a result, Sir Humphrey and Hacker often clash.|$|E

500|$|The {{diplomatic}} mission arrived in Asunción on 20 February 1869. Asunción {{was then a}} small town of unpaved streets and many buildings constructed of little more than straw. With Paraguayan dictator Francisco Solano López on the <b>run,</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> lacked a government. Paranhos had to create a provisional government which could sign a peace accord and recognize the border claimed by Brazil between the two nations. Even with Paraguay devastated, the power vacuum resulting from López's overthrow was quickly filled by emerging domestic factions which Paranhos had to accommodate. According to historian Francisco Doratioto, Paranhos, [...] "the then-greatest Brazilian specialist on Platine affairs", had a [...] "decisive" [...] role in creating a democratic Paraguayan government. Paraguay thus survived as an independent nation. Later, on 20 June 1870, preliminary peace protocols were signed. The final peace treaty accepting Brazilian claims was signed in January 1872.|$|E

500|$|Franklin {{argues that}} the end of the Cold War brought two main changes. First, the threat of war between the United States and Soviet Union was {{replaced}} by regional wars among smaller states. Second, war was transposed to what Franklin calls [...] "another key"—the struggle for global commercial and economic dominance. She asserts that this new form of war is now called globalization and its battlefields are global stock and currency markets. This economic warfare defines the enemy as all those who care about the values of community. [...] "Whatever cannot be merely bought and sold," [...] Franklin writes, [...] "whatever cannot be expressed in terms of money and gain-loss transactions stands in the way of the 'market' as enemy territory to be occupied, transformed and conquered." [...] A main strategy in this kind of warfare is the privatization of formerly public domains such as culture, health care, prisons and education to generate private profit. Franklin contends that the new economic warlords or [...] "marketeers" [...] aim, for example, to transform [...] "the ill health or misery of our neighbours into investment opportunities for the next round of capitalism." [...] She argues that marketeers have become occupying forces served by [...] "puppet governments who <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> for the benefit of the occupiers." [...] Franklin has also noted that in democratic politics, the economy is all that seems to matter. [...] "Canada has almost no foreign policy," [...] she says, [...] "but rather is part of an elaborate network of trade agreements." ...|$|E
500|$|Gjems-Onstad deliberated his post-war {{views on}} the war in a 2008 ten-minute {{television}} special. As he saw it, the Norwegian Labour Party government before the war stood [...] "entirely {{on the side of the}} Soviet Union." [...] He pointed to the Soviet Union as the greatest murderer of the war, and considered that nobody had [...] "opened their eyes" [...] to the fact that the Soviet Union was the only country that won territorial gains following the war. While he maintained that the coup headed by Vidkun Quisling was both bad and illegal, he considered that Quisling should be judged softer in light of the situation at the time. He pointed to the government fleeing the country, and what he considered the [...] "pitiful" [...] reaction of Prime Minister Johan Nygaardsvold. He also noted that while some of the figures in the Quisling regime had acted out far too harshly, some others had tried to maintain Norway's interests against the occupiers; the alternative of letting the Germans <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> completely unopposed under Josef Terboven could in his mind have ended up far worse. Gjems-Onstad said he believed that the treason by Quisling should be compared with the lack of preparations for war by Nygaardsvold and the Labour Party government. Gjems-Onstad also complained that he for unexplained reasons had been kept away from public arrangements related to the Second World War. He said he had not been invited to a single such event. He was also in possession of a large archive of wartime material from the resistance movement in Trøndelag, but said he had not been approached with interest by any public institution.|$|E
500|$|With Shadar defeated, Oliver {{prepares to}} return home, but the White Witch appears and casts a spell known as [...] "manna", an ash-like {{substance}} that turns all living beings {{in the three}} major cities into undead-like creatures. A girl named Pea, who has been appearing to Oliver on occasion, travels with the group and uses her magic to clear the cities of manna and restore the people to normal; the group then travel to defeat the White Witch herself. They discover {{that she was a}} young queen called Cassiopeia from thousands of years ago who had noble intentions, but was manipulated by her [...] "council of twelve", calling themselves the Zodiarchs, who desired to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> Feeling powerless, she found and used the manna spell, believing it would bring peace and prosperity to her people. When the horrific effects of manna were revealed, she gradually witnessed the death of all of her subjects, including the council, and found herself on her own; she was gradually driven to despair and became the White Witch, believing that all life must be destroyed in an attempt to [...] "start over". Her power created an illusory version of the council to oversee the destruction of the world, but the remains of her kind intentions also created the council member that helped the group by sending them back in time, as well as Pea, the incarnation of her as a child. Having been defeated, Cassiopeia fuses together with Pea and is restored to her former, kind self. After assisting the group in destroying the Zodiarchy, the last manifestations of the council, Cassiopeia declares that she will dedicate her life to making amends for her actions and Oliver bids farewell to his friends before returning to his old life in Motorville.|$|E
