Meanwhile, with several decades of development, the insufficiency of technology is no longer the primary factor that restricts the popularization of <b>recycled</b> <b>water.</b> What makes it difficult to promote the concept of reusing <b>recycled</b> <b>water</b> in China? To solve this issue, a special experiment on the public’s attitude towards the reuse of <b>recycled</b> <b>water</b> was designed based on a Single Category Implicit Association Test (SC-IAT), so as to avoid factors like social preference that can influence the survey results, and to gain the public’s negative implicit attitude towards reusing <b>recycled</b> <b>water</b> reuse, which is close to the public’s real attitude to it. From the perspective of implicit attitude, this research testifies the “spiritual contagion” phenomenon of the public, which refers to refusing <b>recycled</b> <b>water</b> reuse because <b>recycled</b> <b>water</b> is made from sewage treatment. By comparing the implicit attitude to <b>recycled</b> <b>water</b> reuse with the explicit attitude that is acquired from self-reporting questionnaires about reusing <b>recycled</b> <b>water,</b> this research finds that the implicit attitude is more positive than the explicit attitude, which accounts for the phenomenon of “best game no one played” in the promotion of the <b>recycled</b> <b>water</b> reuse, that is, the public though applauding the environment-friendly policy, will not actually use the <b>recycled</b> <b>water...</b>|$|R

The departure point for this research was given by specific articles and principles of the 60 / 2000 Water Framework Directive. According to them, <b>recycled</b> <b>water</b> evaluation {{can be viewed as a}} corollary of this directive. Since Crete is a European region with intense water shortage problems, this was a good opportunity to apply the suggestions of the directive: solve the problem of water shortage internally (i. e. in Crete, with the island's own means and plans, since Crete can be regarded as a single river basin district), make the most of marginal waters while at the same time enhancing the environment. The evaluation of <b>recycled</b> <b>water</b> has been implemented through the involvement of two distinctive groups of people: farmers and consumers. Therefore, on the one hand, the research asks farmers whether they would be willing to use <b>recycled</b> <b>water</b> of certain qualities for the irrigation of olive trees and tomatoes and on the other hand, the research asks consumers whether they would be willing to use and pay for food products irrigated with <b>recycled</b> <b>water.</b> Results show there is social acquiescence on <b>recycled</b> <b>water</b> usage. This is confirmed by the correspondence of willingness to use <b>recycled</b> <b>water</b> between farmers and consumers.

Water use efficiency and recycling are becoming essential parts of water quality protection and water use allocation at the federal and state levels. However, major barriers to the use of <b>recycled</b> <b>water</b> still exist in many forms. Policy and regulation of <b>recycled</b> <b>water</b> vary tremendously between regions, states, and municipalities.

Drawing on social psychological literature, two experimental studies are presented, which explore messages that improve public perceptions of potable <b>recycled</b> <b>water.</b> The Elaboration-Likelihood Model of information processing and attitude change is tested and supported. Study 1 (N[*]=[*] 415) premeasured support for <b>recycled</b> <b>water,</b> and trust in government information at Time 1.

There was tentative evidence of this in response to two-sided messages rather than one-sided messages. Initial attitudes to <b>recycled</b> <b>water</b> moderated responses to information.

40|$|California’s mild {{coastal regions}} produce 90 % of {{avocados}} {{grown in the}} United States. However, drought and urbanization are placing a strain on water supplies for agriculture. Avocados are a thirsty crop (an acre of avocado orchards consumes 4 acre-feet/year), and are particularly sensitive to salt. <b>Recycled</b> <b>water</b> has been proposed for irrigation, however it is higher in salt content than freshwater sources. Results from this study identify potential problems that may arise from avocado irrigation with <b>recycled</b> <b>water</b> and strategies for mitigating such issues. Trees irrigated with potable water at rates of 14, 12, and 9 gallons per hour were compared with trees irrigated with <b>recycled</b> <b>water</b> at the same application rates. Effects of <b>recycled</b> <b>water</b> on soil quality, tree health, fruit yield, and fruit quality were assessed and {{provide a framework for}} future implementation of <b>recycled</b> <b>water</b> irrigation in avocado orchards. Findings showed that <b>recycled</b> <b>water</b> impaired tree growth and health. Leaves were also deficient in micronutrients such as iron and zinc, while elevated in macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium). Poor tree health and suboptimal leaf nutrition reduced yield and fruit quality among trees irrigated with <b>recycled</b> <b>water.</b> Fruit rot occurred more frequently and with greater severity in trees irrigated with recycled water; these fruits also had reduced post-harvest shelf-life. Soil clay content also affected tree health. Trees irrigated with potable water at 9 and 14 gallons/hour showed higher rates of saltburn damage than expected; these trees were situated on heavy clay soils, which would explain abnormally high leaf damage for trees irrigated with potable water. Clay reduces soil aeration and leaching; reduced oxygen availability to avocado roots encourages chloride uptake and chloride damage. However, these trees still produced a copious crop. The study demonstrates that improvements in treated wastewater quality are needed prior to application of <b>recycled</b> <b>water</b> to avocado orchards, and that <b>recycled</b> <b>water</b> irrigation necessitates non-traditional strategies for orchard management...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} explore the {{influence}} mechanism of traditional Chinese culture values on urban residents’ acceptance of the reuse of <b>recycled</b> <b>water,</b> this paper selects interdependent self-constructional indicators representing the dependency relation between people as the representative of traditional culture values. In this paper, interdependent self-constructional indicators are introduced based on a technology acceptance model (TAM), {{in order to establish}} a hypothesis model. Following this, the writer conducts a study that shows the influence on the acceptance of <b>recycled</b> <b>water</b> through the formation of interdependent self-construction. Finally, the influence mechanism of traditional cultural values on citizens’ behavior regarding the reuse of <b>recycled</b> <b>water</b> is determined. To start with, the writer verifies {{the reliability and validity of}} data from 584 samples, and then tests the goodness-of-fit between the sample data and the hypothesis model by AMOS 21. 0 (software). On this basis, the writer analyzes the direct and indirect influence through the hypothesis model and finds that the interdependent self-constructional intensity will accelerate the acceptance process of <b>recycled</b> <b>water</b> technology by positively influencing a change in the residents’ attitudes to <b>recycled</b> <b>water.</b> The conclusion shows that traditional Chinese cultural values have a certain influence on urban residents’ acceptance of the reuse of <b>recycled</b> <b>water.</b> Meanwhile, the writer clarifies the influence’s mechanism...|$|R
