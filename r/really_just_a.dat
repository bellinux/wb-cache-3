500|$|Critics {{stressed}} that {{a knowledge of}} Macbeth was not necessary to enjoy the episode. [...] "Knowing the text", suggested Jack Seale of Radio Times, [...] "will take you only halfway and, in any case, the clever plot is <b>really</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> vehicle for characters sketched fully {{in only a few}} lines, and a torrent of fruity luvvie gags about jealousy, superstition and stage-hogging hams." [...] Dessau agreed, saying that [...] "ou don't need to be a literary scholar to get the gags". Critic Jane Simon, writing in the Daily Mirror, suggested that [...] "even a hazy knowledge of the Scottish play will tip you the wink what might lie ahead". David Chater in The Times and an anonymous reviewer in the Sunday Herald both praised the plot's divergence from Shakespeare, with the latter saying that [...] "the script cleverly offers parallels with The Scottish Play, just to whip them away again". Dessau felt that the complex plot meant that the guest stars did [...] "not get quite as much screen time as they deserve", but that this was no complaint, as it was [...] "very much Pemberton and Shearsmith's instalment and they are both brilliant".|$|E

[...] To accommodate the effect, Correll had to use a large amount of exposure without making the bar appear overlit. Much of the lighting was provided by tables rigged with fluorescent tubes to provide an effect different {{from other parts of the}} film. Correll could not add smoke to the scene to enhance the bar [...] "feel", because the disturbed atmosphere would have made ILM's game hard to insert. The scene was intended to end in a barroom brawl when security tried to take McCoy into custody; Nimoy decided that [...] "it didn't feel right" [...] and there was not enough time or money to achieve the scene successfully.|$|E
500|$|He again played Harry Osborn in Spider-Man 3 (2007). In {{contrast}} to the previous two films' positive reviews, Spider-Man 3 was met with a mixed reception by critics. Nonetheless, with a total worldwide gross of $891million, it stands as the most successful film in the series, and Franco's highest-grossing film to date. In this same year, Franco made a cameo appearance as himself in the Apatow-directed comedy Knocked Up, which starred Freaks and Geeks alumni Seth Rogen, Jason Segel and Martin Starr. Franco co-starred with Sienna Miller in the low-budget independent film Camille, a dark fantasy dramedy about a young newlywed couple and Interview, where he appears in a voice only role, both 2007 movies that were ignored by audiences and critics alike. Among his other 2007 projects were Good Time Max, which Franco wrote, directed and starred in. The movie premiered at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival and centers around two talented brothers who take very diverse paths in life, one going {{on to become a}} doctor whilst the other sibling (Franco) experiences unemployment and uses drugs.

500|$|In November, [...] "Apples and Oranges" [...] was {{released}} {{as a single}} but failed to chart at all. The band eventually went back to De Lane Lea and recorded the unreleased track [...] "Vegetable Man". Sometime around Christmas, David Gilmour (Barrett's old school friend) was asked to join the band as a second lead guitarist to cover for Barrett when his erratic behaviour prevented him from performing. As Barrett had, up until then, written (or co-written) most of the songs on the band's debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, {{as well as the}} band's three singles up to this point, the initial plan was to keep him in the group as a non-touring member – in similar style to Brian Wilson's recent status in The Beach Boys – but this meant that Barrett and the group were essentially separated. For two days from 10 January 1968, Pink Floyd reconvened at EMI Studios, attempting to work on older tracks: Waters' vocals and Wright's organ were overdubbed onto [...] "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun", while Mason added vocals to [...] "Scream Thy Last Scream". Upon leaving Pink Floyd, Barrett said to Melody Maker: [...] "I suppose it was <b>really</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> matter of being a little offhand about things".|$|E
500|$|Neela Debnath of The Independent commented {{positively}} on the show's continuing {{exploration of}} the Daleks and the more [...] "adult tone", praising {{the performance of the}} three leads. Radio Times writer Patrick Mulkern stated that it [...] "ticks all [...] boxes as a Doctor Who fan of more than 40 years standing", describing it as [...] "clever, fast, funny, eerie, surprising and tearjerking". Nick Setchfield of SFX gave the episode five out of five stars, calling it a [...] "strong, cinematically-minded series opener" [...] which succeeded in making the Daleks scary. He also praised Coleman's debut, Smith's performance, the special effects, and Amy and Rory's emotional subplot. io9 reviewer Charlie Jane Anders noted that the plot [...] "is mostly just an excuse to explore the Doctor's ongoing relationship with the Daleks, and to show how sad it's gotten". Both Anders and Mulkern (the latter citing a Doctor Who veteran, Katy Manning) noted that Oswin's fascination with eggs, required for making soufflés, is <b>really</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> mental trick to block out the [...] "exterminate" [...] ("eggs-terminate") conditioning; this literary device is woven throughout the episode as a series of subtle hints, as Rory is confused by a dormant Dalek, initially misinterpreting him as saying [...] "eggs".|$|E
5000|$|Negative correlatives {{can also}} occur with already {{negative}} verb forms. In literary Welsh, the mutated verb form {{is caused by}} an initial negative particle, ni or nid. The particle is usually omitted in speech but the mutation remains: Ni wyddai neb (word-for-word, [...] "Not not-knew nobody") means [...] "Nobody knew" [...] and Ni chaiff Aled fawr o bres (word-for-word, [...] "Not not-will-get Aled lots of money") means [...] "Aled will not get much money". This is not usually regarded as three negative markers, however, because the negative mutation is <b>really</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> effect of the initial particle on the following word.|$|R

500|$|It took Levi {{approximately}} {{one year to}} record all of his dialogue {{due in part to}} his busy schedule. Levi recorded once every six weeks for six hours at a time, recording each of his lines at least twice. The actor's voice ultimately helped shape and develop Flynn's character. Howard explained, [...] "He's so smart and clever, and his adlibs are so great, and you like him straight away ... he brings that to Flynn." [...] On Levi's own influence on his character, the actor explained that Flynn's [...] "voice was <b>really</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> slight variation of [...] own". Wanting to sound [...] "more appropriate" [...] for the film's medieval setting, Levi [...] "cleaned up [...] own diction and made things a little bit more polished", referring to Flynn's accent as Mid-Atlantic. Describing Tangled as a [...] "very family friendly" [...] version of Romancing the Stone (1984), Levi studied and channelled the film's star, American actor Michael Douglas, and English legend Robin Hood. However, when Levi heard his performance in its entirety for the first time after the film's release, the actor admitted that he was ultimately dissatisfied with his performance, explaining, [...] "I felt like I sounded incredibly nasally and I was plugged up," [...] likening the experience to hearing one's voice played back on an answering machine.|$|E
500|$|Specialized types: cancella; scutella; scutes; [...] Also defined herewith: reticulae; acrometatarsium/acrotarsium. The {{scales of}} birds are {{composed}} of keratin like their beaks and claws, and are found mainly on the toes and metatarsus, though they may appear further up on the ankle. They do not overlap significantly, except {{in the cases of}} kingfishers and woodpeckers. The scales and scutes of birds were originally thought to be homologous to those of reptiles and mammals; Later research, however, suggests that scales in birds re-evolved after the evolution of feathers. Bird embryos begin development with smooth skin. On the feet, the corneum, or outermost layer of this skin may keratinize, thicken and form scales. Bird scales can be organized into:i) cancella—minute scales which are <b>really</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> thickening and hardening of the skin, crisscrossed with shallow grooves;ii) scutella—scales that are not quite as large as scutes, such as those found on the caudal, or hind part, of the chicken metatarsus; and iii) scutes—the largest scales, usually on the anterior surface of the metatarsus and dorsal surface of the toes. The rows of scutes on the anterior of the metatarsus is sometimes termed an [...] "acrometatarsium" [...] or [...] "acrotarsium".Reticulae, by contrast, are small, keeled scale-like structures covering the bottoms of bird feet, but are not true scales. Evolutionary developmental studies on reticulae found that they are composed entirely of alpha-keratin (whereas, true epidermal scales {{are composed of}} a mix of alpha and beta keratin). This, along with their unique structure, has led to the suggestion that reticulae are actually feather buds that were arrested early in development.|$|E
500|$|Around Christmas 1967, guitarist David Gilmour, an {{old friend}} of Barrett's from Cambridge, was asked by the other members of Pink Floyd to join as a second guitarist, {{initially}} to not replace Barrett, but to cover for him, because his unpredictable behaviour prevented him from performing. For several shows Gilmour sang and played guitar while Barrett wandered around on stage, every now and then deciding to join in playing guitar and singing. Waters and fellow band members keyboardist Richard Wright and drummer Nick Mason soon grew weary of Barrett's on-stage antics and, on 26 January 1968, when Waters was driving his bandmates from London to a show at Southampton University, they all agreed to go without Barrett: according to Gilmour's recollection, one person asked, [...] "Shall we pick Syd up?" [...] and another said, [...] "Let's not bother." [...] Since Barrett had written or co-written 10 of the 11 songs on their debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, as well as the band's three singles up to this point, the original plan was to keep him in the group as a non-touring member − in a similar arrangement to what The Beach Boys had done with Brian Wilson − but this soon proved to be unworkable. At his last rehearsal with the band, he presented a new song entitled [...] "Have You Got It Yet?", which proved to be deliberately unplayable as the others attempted to join in, until they realised the joke of the title. On 6 April, the group officially announced that Barrett was no longer a member of Pink Floyd. Upon leaving the Floyd, Barrett said to Melody Maker: [...] "I suppose it was <b>really</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> matter of being a little offhand about things".|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the true defences as mentioned above, there are other [...] "defences" [...] in a broader sense. In some cases, these [...] "defences" [...] are <b>really</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> assertion that the Crown has not proven one {{of the elements of}} the offence. For example, the mistake of fact defence involves an assertion that the accused misunderstood some material factual matter that prevented him from forming the requisite mens rea for the offence. In the context of sexual assault, for example, a mistake of fact defence usually involves an assertion that the accused did not realize the complainant was not consenting. Since the mens rea for sexual assault includes a subjective appreciation {{of the fact that the}} complainant is not consenting, the [...] "defence" [...] of mistake of fact in this context is thus properly understood as a failure on the part of the Crown to prove its case. In practical terms and common parlance, however, it is still considered to be a defence. Another example of this more general kind of defence is the [...] "i.d. defence", which is <b>really</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> assertion by the accused that the Crown has failed to prove the identity of the perpetrator of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt.
