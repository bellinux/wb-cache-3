40|$|This {{communication}} {{describes a}} small <b>redox</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> fabricated using {{a design that}} omits the membrane normally used to separate anodic and cathodic compartments. This design exploits the laminar flow 1 that occurs in liquids flowing at low Reynolds number (Re) to eliminate convective mixing of fuels. Two separate streams-one oxidizing and one reducing- flow {{parallel to one another}} through the channel, and no membrane is needed to separate these streams (only diffusive exchange occurs across the interface between them). We demonstrate this concept by operating a millimeter-scale <b>redox</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> that uses the redox couples V(V) /V(IV) (cathodic compartment) and V(III) /V(II) (anodic compartment) 2 - 5 and that presents no added mechanical nor electrical resistance between the two aqueous solutions. Previous work on fuel cells that do not require a membrane has used selective catalysts or enzymes to restrict reactions of oxidant and reductant present in a mixture to the appropriate electrode. 6 - 11 An example from Dyer 6 used a mixture of O 2 and H 2; another, by Willner et al., 9, 10 was a biofuel cell with enzymes as catalysts. Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of a single cell. We used soft lithography to fabricate a channel with two inlets and one outlet either in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) using soft lithography (for thick channels: h 200 ím) or in SU- 8 photoresist using conventional lithography (for thin channels: h 50 ím); 12, 13 details of fabrication are given in the Supporting Information. We used graphite rather than metals as the electrodes to reduce electrolysis of water during the operation of the cell. 14 The vanadium system has two redox couples with a large difference in formal potentials, 1. 0 V/NHE for V(V) /V(IV) (as VO 2 +/VO 2 +) and- 0. 25 V/NHE for V(III) /V(II). 15 We prepared these two redox species by electrolyzing an 1 M solution of VOSO 4 in 25 % H 2 SO 4 in two half-cells separated by a Nafion membrane.

40|$|Two {{approaches}} {{pertaining to}} the direct liquid <b>redox</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> (DLRFC) have been investigated and demonstrated: mixed-reactant operation and in situ regeneration of the redox couple. The former involves supplying a mixed methanol Fe 2 +/Fe 3 + redox electrolyte to the selective carbon cathode of the DLRFC and supplying the fuel to the anode via methanol crossover. This approach {{has the potential to}} significantly improve the cost, compactness, and volumetric and gravimetric power densities of the cell. The latter in situ regeneration approach involves substituting the fuel supply with air to spontaneously reverse the direction of electron flow in a DLRFC, which eliminates the need for an auxiliary regeneration unit and reduces the overall cost and complexity of a DLRFC system. Both modes of DLRFC operation, discharge, and regeneration, produce power that is unique compared to conventional systems. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} alcohols, aldehydes, and {{carboxylic}} acids were oxidized {{under mild conditions}} (60 - 80 °C, 3 M H 2 S 04 in water) by Fe(II 1) using a catalytic amount of Pt black to generate Fe(I 1) and protons. The extent of oxidation depended on the structures of the organic reductant and on reaction conditions. A <b>redox</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> that catalyzed the complete oxidation of ethyl-ene glycol by dioxygen at 80 °C was assembled. Fe(I 1) generated by oxidation of ethylene glycol was reoxidized to Fe(II 1) at the anode of the cell.

40|$|The {{past few}} decades have shown a rapid and {{continuous}} exhaustion of the available energy resources which may lead to serious energy global crises. Researchers have been focusing on developing new and renewable energy resources to meet the increasing fuel demand and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The aerobic membraneless direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) was fed an anolyte solution of 1 MCH 3 OH/ 0. 5 MH 2 SO 4 and an air oxidant. The anaerobic membraneless direct methanol <b>redox</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> (DMRFC) was fed an anolyte solution of 1 M CH 3 OH/ 0. 1 M HClO 4 and a catholyte solution of 2 M Fe(ClO 4) 3 and 0. 22 M Fe(ClO 4) 2 oxidant. For {{both cases the}} membraneless architecture performed significantly better than for the conventional PEM architecture with Nafion 117. The maximum power density for the membraneless and Nafion 117 based DMFC was 52 mW cm 2 and 41 mW cm 2 respectively.

40|$|Advancements in the {{performance}} of the direct methanol <b>redox</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> (DMRFC) were made through anolyte/catholyte composition and cell temperature studies. Catholytes prepared with different iron salts were considered for use in the DMRFC in order to improve the catholyte charge density (i. e., iron salt solubility) and fuel cell performance. Following an initial screening of different iron salts, catholytes prepared with FeNH 2 ̆ 084 (SO 2 ̆ 084) 2 ̆ 082, Fe(ClO 2 ̆ 084) 2 ̆ 083 or Fe(NO 2 ̆ 083) 2 ̆ 083 were selected and evaluated using electrolyte conductivity measurements, cyclic voltammetry and fuel cell testing. Solubility limits at 25 0 C were observed to be much higher for the Fe(ClO 2 ̆ 084) 2 ̆ 083 (> 2. 5 M) and Fe(NO 2 ̆ 083) 2 ̆ 083 (> 3 M) salts than FeNH 2 ̆ 084 (SO 2 ̆ 084) 2 ̆ 082 (1 M). The Fe(ClO 2 ̆ 084) 2 ̆ 083 catholyte was identified as a suitable candidate due to its high electrochemical activity, electrochemical reversibility, observed half-cell potential (0. 83 V vs. SHE at 90 0 C) and solubility. DMRFC testing at 90 0 C demonstrated a substantial improvement in the non-optimized power density for the perchlorate system (79 mW cm- 2) relative to that obtained for the sulfate system (25 mW cm- 2). Separate fuel cell tests showed that increasing the cell temperature to 90 0 C and increasing the methanol concentration in the anolyte to 16. 7 M (i. e., equimolar H 2 ̆ 082 O/CH 2 ̆ 083 OH) yield significant DMRFC performance improvements.

30|$|Recently, {{carbon-based}} {{materials such}} as reduced graphene oxide (rGO), graphene oxide (GO), and graphene are being more frequently used for various applications such as <b>redox</b> catalysts or <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> {{because they can be}} easily engineered by introducing functional groups [1 – 4].

In other words, rGO can also be used as an efficient metal-free catalyst for catalytic reactions because it can act as ideal components as we insert various dopants into rGO [5 – 11].

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} the dynamic modeling and the simulation {{results of a}} renewable energy based hybrid power generation system. In order to meet sustained load demands during varying natural conditions, different renewable energy sources need to be integrated with each other. The paper focuses on the combination of solar cell (SC), wind turbine (WT), hydro turbine (HT), <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> (FC) and vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) systems for power generation. As the wind turbine output power varies with the wind speed, the hydro turbine output power with the water speed and the solar cell output power with both the ambient temperature and radiation, a FC system with an UC bank and a VRB system can be integrated to store excess wind, hydro and solar energies under all conditions. Dynamic modeling of various components of this isolated system is presented. Transient responses of the system to step changes in the load, ambient temperature, radiation, wind speed and water speed {{in a number of}} possible situations are studied. The results show that the proposed hybrid power system can tolerate the rapid changes in natural conditions and suppress the effects of these fluctuations on the voltage within the acceptable range.
