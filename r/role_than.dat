5|$|The Naval Treaties of the 1920s and 1930s {{limited the}} number of battleships, though {{technical}} innovation in battleship design continued. Both the Allied and Axis powers built battleships during World War II, though the increasing importance of the aircraft carrier meant that the battleship played a less important <b>role</b> <b>than</b> had been expected.|$|E
5|$|Computer models {{suggest that}} {{collisions}} of cometary debris during the formation period play {{a far greater}} <b>role</b> <b>than</b> was previously thought. According to these models, the number of collisions early in the Solar System's history {{was so great that}} most comets were destroyed before they reached the Oort cloud. Therefore, the current cumulative mass of the Oort cloud is far less than was once suspected. The estimated mass of the cloud is {{only a small part of}} the 50–100 Earth masses of ejected material.|$|E
5|$|Following Toronto's first-round exit, McGrady {{became a}} free agent, signing a six-year, $67.5 million {{contract}} with the Orlando Magic. He elected to join the Magic {{in part because he}} disliked his secondary role playing behind Vince Carter, in part so that he could return home to Florida, and in part to play with their other newly acquired free agent, Grant Hill. Hill would go on to play in only 47 games total throughout his tenure with the team, forcing McGrady into a larger leadership and scoring <b>role</b> <b>than</b> anticipated.|$|E

5|$|The Alaskas were officially {{funded in}} September 1940 {{along with a}} plethora of other ships {{as a part of}} the Two-Ocean Navy Act. Their role had been altered slightly: in {{addition}} to their surface-to-surface role, they were planned to protect carrier groups. Because of their bigger guns, greater size and increased speed, they would be more valuable in this <b>role</b> <b>than</b> heavy cruisers, and would provide insurance against reports that Japan was building super cruisers more powerful than U.S. heavy cruisers.|$|E
5|$|With Taurasi {{joining the}} core of the 2000 Championship team, Auriemma {{confidently}} predicted another championship in 2001, but the season {{turned out to be more}} difficult than expected. UConn won the Big East Tournament over Notre Dame in a game remembered for the Bird at the Buzzer shot, but lost key players Abrosimova and Ralph to season-ending injuries. As a consequence, Taurasi had to play a much larger <b>role</b> <b>than</b> anticipated in the NCAA Tournament. She led UConn to the Final Four, but in the national semifinals against Notre Dame in St. Louis, Taurasi had a poor shooting game, and despite UConn having attained a 16-point lead at one point, the team lost. Notre Dame went on to win its first National Championship.|$|E
5|$|Argento {{reportedly}} {{offered the}} lead role of Peter Neal to Christopher Walken, but eventually it went to Anthony Franciosa. Kim Newman felt that Franciosa's casting was fortunate, as {{he was capable of}} bringing more to the <b>role</b> <b>than</b> the script asked of him. He also believed that if Walken had been cast, it would have been more obvious that he was the killer. According to Jones and Daria Nicolodi, the relationship between Franciosa and Argento was a fractious one. In addition, Nicolodi and Argento were romantically involved at the time, but their relationship had suffered over a disputed story credit during the filming of Suspiria. Nicolodi therefore only agreed to a brief appearance in Tenebrae. By her own account, she originally asked for the small role of Jane McKerrowwhich ultimately went to Veronica Lario. Nicolodi was, according to Alan Jones, cast as the woman on the beach in Neal's flashback. Conversely, Thomas Rostock opines that Nicolodi was never intended for that role, only that of Jane. Transgender actress Eva Robin's was later hired to play the woman on the beach.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland's final regular-season {{game was}} a shutout {{victory over the}} Baltimore Colts. The Browns amassed 559 passing and rushing yards against the Colts, winning 42–0 and ending {{the season with a}} 12–1–1 record. Graham threw for three touchdowns, {{boosting}} his season total to 25, and raised his total passing yards to 2,752. Backup quarterback Cliff Lewis threw another touchdown in the third quarter as Graham and most of the other starters were pulled from the game. Groza returned to the lineup after sitting out several weeks because of an injury. He kicked all four of the Browns' extra points and played a bigger <b>role</b> <b>than</b> usual as an offensive and defensive tackle because of an injury to Ernie Blandin in the second quarter. Cleveland's defense held Baltimore to 186 yards of total offense. The Yankees beat the Bills 35–13 the same week as Sanders scored three touchdowns. New York ended with an 11–2–1 record, winning the eastern division and a spot in the championship game against the Browns.|$|E

5|$|However, some job {{still had}} to be found for Chotiner, who had wound up his California {{practice}} and sold his home. Haldeman refused to have him in the White House, and Nixon's aides deemed that the Democratic-controlled Senate was unlikely to confirm Chotiner for any post requiring its approval. On April 10, 1969, acting Special Representative for Trade Negotiations Theodore R. Gates appointed Chotiner as General Counsel to his office, as almost simultaneously, the White House announced Gates' replacement, Carl J. Gilbert. On April 1, Nixon had issued Executive Order 11463, making the position of general counsel in that office a Schedule C, or political appointment, and significantly raising the salary of the position. Nixon press secretary Ron Ziegler stated that the salary had been raised because the new incumbent was expected to play a more active <b>role</b> <b>than</b> had previous holders of the position.|$|E

5|$|In other countries, {{the state}} played a {{stronger}} {{role in the}} process of commissioning memorials. France, for example, mostly relied on local communities to organise and commission most war memorials, but the state played a comparatively larger <b>role</b> <b>than</b> in Britain and similar countries. A law was passed in 1919 establishing an official role for local government officials {{in the process of}} commissioning memorials; many towns then formed committees to take this process forward, typically at the commune level. Members of the Souvenir Français organisation {{played an important role in}} many of the resulting local committees. In other cases, governments increased their role in commissioning memorials during the inter-war period. In Romania, most memorials in the early 1920s were initially erected by local communities; in 1919 the royal family created the Societatea Cultul Eroilor Morţi to oversee commemoration of the war more generally; the organisation was headed by the Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church. By the 1930s official concern over the diverse range of designs led to increased central control over the process.|$|E
5|$|Sherman {{was elected}} in 1892 to a sixth term, easily {{defeating}} the Democratic candidate in the state legislature. The more difficult fight had been for the Republican caucus's vote, as many preferred Foraker to Sherman. With assistance from Cleveland businessman Mark Hanna, and after four days of balloting, the caucus agreed to support Sherman over Foraker, and he was reelected by the full legislature on January 12, 1893. In 1894, Sherman surpassed Thomas Hart Benton's record for longest tenure in the Senate. His memoirs, Recollections of Forty Years in the House, Senate and Cabinet, were published the following year. In 1896 he gave speeches on behalf of fellow Ohioan William McKinley in his campaign for the presidency, but took a lesser <b>role</b> <b>than</b> in previous campaigns because of his advanced age. McKinley was elected over Democrat William Jennings Bryan. Wishing to see the appointment of Hanna, his friend and political manager, to the Senate, McKinley created a vacancy by appointing Sherman to his cabinet as Secretary of State.|$|E
5|$|The Regent let his ministers {{take full}} charge of {{government}} affairs, playing a far lesser <b>role</b> <b>than</b> his father. The {{principle that the}} prime minister was the person supported by {{a majority in the}} House of Commons, whether the king personally favoured him or not, became established. His governments, with little help from the Regent, presided over British policy. One of the most important political conflicts facing the country concerned Catholic emancipation, the movement to relieve Roman Catholics of various political disabilities. The Tories, led by the Prime Minister, Spencer Perceval, were opposed to Catholic emancipation, while the Whigs supported it. At the beginning of the Regency, the Prince of Wales was expected to support the Whig leader, William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville. He did not, however, immediately put Lord Grenville and the Whigs into office. Influenced by his mother, he claimed that a sudden dismissal of the Tory government would exact too great a toll on the health of the King (a steadfast supporter of the Tories), thereby eliminating any chance of a recovery.|$|E

A month later, he scored his first goal for Millwall in a 3–1 victory over Huddersfield Town. Playing in a deeper <b>role</b> <b>than</b> when at Stevenage, Morison struggled for goals, but made the majority of Millwall's goals throughout October, whilst also netting in a 5–0 win over Tranmere Rovers. In December 2009, he scored a 91st-minute winner in a 3–2 victory over Milton Keynes Dons, and also scored a similar goal in a 4–0 win over Staines Town in the FA Cup. Three days later, Morison scored twice in Millwall's 2–1 victory over Walsall. His fine form through December continued, scoring twice in a 4–4 draw against Charlton Athletic at The Valley. He scored his seventh goal in as many games in a 2–0 win over Bristol Rovers, whilst also assisting the second goal. Morison scored his second goal of Millwall's FA Cup campaign against Derby County at Pride Park in early January 2010; scoring in the 108th minute as Millwall were knocked out 5–3 on a penalty shootout. He provided the assists for both of Millwall's goals in games against Southampton and Oldham Athletic respectively, before scoring the winner in a 1–0 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion; his 11th goal of the season. This was followed up with a brace in a 3–1 win away to Carlisle United, whilst also setting up Millwall's third goal. Morison scored another brace four days later, as Millwall beat Charlton Athletic 4–0. His 17th of the season came {{in front of the}} Sky cameras against Leeds United at Elland Road. Shortly after, Morison scored his 18th goal of the campaign, scoring a header from an acute angle in Millwall's 5–0 win over Stockport County. As a result of his fine goalscoring form throughout March, Morison was named Football League One Player of the Month. Another goal followed for Morison in a 2–1 win away at Colchester United. Morison's 20th goal of the season came in a 2–1 victory over Leyton Orient, scoring Millwall's second goal from the penalty spot. The goal subsequently means that Morison has now scored 20 goals or more in his last six seasons for three different clubs. On {{the last day of the}} season, Morison scored a brace against Swindon Town in a 3–2 victory. Morison's first was a coolly dispatched penalty, whilst he supplied the cross that led to an own goal. Morison's second goal of the game was a half-volley from outside the area; looping into the top right-hand corner of the net. He scored his 23rd goal of the season in Millwall's 2–0 win against Huddersfield Town as Millwall progressed to the League One play-off final, where they beat Swindon Town 1–0 at Wembley Stadium; Morison's third successive victory at the stadium.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Adams {{gives it a}} large amount of {{diversity}} within its forests. On the west side, down in the lower valleys, grand fir and Douglas fir dominate the forest with Western hemlock and Western red cedar as well. On the east side, Douglas fir and ponderosa pine are dominant with some patches of dense lodgepole pine. Western hemlock and Western red cedar also occur, but are limited to creek and river bottoms. Grand fir is present on sites with better moisture retention. At middle elevations on the west side, grand fir is increasingly replaced by Pacific silver fir and noble fir; and on the east side, lodgepole becomes much more prevalent. Above a certain elevation, lodgepole pine also appears in areas on the west side as well. As elevation increases further, the forest changes again with subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and mountain hemlock becoming the dominant tree species on all sides of the mountain. Eventually, the last trees to disappear from the mountainside are the highly cold tolerant whitebark pine and mountain hemlock. Other conifers, 18 species in all, that play a lesser <b>role</b> <b>than</b> the dominant species are Western white pine, Sitka spruce, Western larch, Pacific yew, Alaska cedar, and mountain juniper. Adams is also home to many hardwoods as well including the tree species big leaf maple, Oregon white oak, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, and red alder. Large shrubs/small trees include the dwarf birch, Suksdorf’s hawthorn, California hazelnut, bitter cherry, vine maple, Douglas maple, and blue elderberry and contribute to a vibrant fall display.|$|E
