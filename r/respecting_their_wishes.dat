40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} the knowledge, attitudes, {{and practices of}} palliative care nurses in Lebanon. Method: Cross-sectional descriptive survey using self-administered questionnaire; 1873 nurses from 15 hospitals were included. Results: Non-clinical nurses had better knowledge on the outcomes of palliative care than all other specialties. Oncology nurses had more favourable attitudes than other specialties with regard to informing patients about their diagnosis, patients having the right to 'do-not-resuscitate', involving patients in treatment choices, and <b>respecting</b> <b>their</b> <b>wishes</b> for alternative therapy. Surgical, acute critical care, and obstetric/gynaecology nurses had significantly more negative attitudes towards patients' and families' questions and concerns than other specialties. Conclusion: Formal education in palliative care and development of palliative care services are needed in Lebanon to provide quality care to terminally ill patients. PublishedN/...|$|E
40|$|Progress in {{medicine}} and changes in our society have led to {{an increasing number of}} patients with cancer and a change in the doctor–patient relationship. Patients rights are now defined in several countries by laws. The course of cancer involves numerous imaging examinations in which the radiologist is primarily involved. It is often the radiologist who discovers abnormalities and who must break the news to the patient. This task is made all the more difficult by the radiologist’s lack of specific training in the management of difficult situations such as announcing bad news. There is a high risk of inappropriate responses that can have a seriously damaging effect on the patient’s state of mind. Even with the best intentions, it can be very profitable to review and improve our relational modalities and to more effectively meet the patient’s increasing demand for information. The radiologist’s technical know-how is not sufficient, as he must also be able to give {{just the right amount of}} information based on his clinical competence, and his relationship with patients while <b>respecting</b> <b>their</b> <b>wishes</b> and their rights...|$|E
40|$|In 2006 a {{study is}} done to {{generate}} ergonomic advices {{with respect to the}} design of a standardized crate that is to be used in flower bulb cultivation and flower bulb trade. Reason for this study was an earlier AKK study, which concluded that standardisation of the crates will reduce costs (particularly for transport) and improve flower bulb quality. Therefore, companies in this sector try to implement standardized crates. The aim {{of the present study was}} to give ergonomic advices concerning the layout of these crates, resulting in reduction of the physical load during manual handling of them. Another goal was to satisfy the people who will have to work with the crates, by <b>respecting</b> <b>their</b> <b>wishes</b> and requirements as far as possible. In close cooperation with the manager of the AKK-study, labour-related questions which remained unanswered in that study are inventoried. Further, according to the method `ergonomic design, additional wishes of the people who will have will work with the standardised crates have been formulated. Finally is examined how the inventoried requirements and wishes can be fulfilled. For that purpose the questions were answered, based on literature reviews, measurements and expertise. Some of the most important results are that: Physical load is lower during the lifting of 40 x 60 cm crates than during the lifting of 50 x 75 cm crates with the same weight. The physical load during the lifting of low standing crates reduces when the crates (and therefore handles) are as high as possible, but this effect is very small. Since the height of the piles is limited by other factors, no effect of crate altitude on physical load is expected when crates have to be moved from or to a high level. Without the use of special tools the physical load is always too high when piles are higher than 1. 70 m. But even in ideal conditions the lifting of 15 or 20 kg crates to an altitude of 1. 70 m results in a Lifting Index of 1. 1 or 1. 4 respectively, what is higher than the health standard. For handles, a dimension of 125 x 40 mm is recommended. Sharp edges must be avoided and it must be impossible to put sharp objects, such as staples, through the handles. Closed handles prevent that bulbs fall through the handles. Physical load when crates are taken from or placed on a high pile can be reduced al little when these handles are not only at the top of the crates, but also halfway. No large effect of standardisation of the layout of the crates on mechanisation is expected, since nearly all tools do not pick up the crates but grip them. Standardisation of the format (40 x 60 cm) is important, however, and the sides must be exactly rectangular. For transport in conditioned sea containers (inner width 2. 26 or 2. 28 m.) 100 x 120 cm pallets are most suitable. However, physical load during manual piling up of crates on these pallets is higher than when 80 x 100 cm pallets are used. In both cases the health limits are largely exceeded during manual handling of the crates. If crates with different altitudes must become piled up on the same pallet, tuning of the altitude of the different crates is needed. Good examples are 18 and 24 cm or 16. 5 and 22 cm. If it must be possible to read the information on the crates automatically, transponders (chips) are preferred over bar codes. It is recommended to apply a low-frequency system and to give all crates only a unique number. A central database can contain information concerning the contents of all crates. The recommendations in this report answer different questions and some of them can not be combined with some others. For this reason the `ideal crate will be a combination of compromises. Therefore it is recommended - in accordance with the original design of this study to carry out a pilot before choosing definitively for one basic design for the standardized crates. In this pilot all users should be involved, and it is preferred to let them test a number of copies of the aimed types of cask...|$|E

40|$|Background: Some {{patients}} with advanced and progressive diseases express {{a desire to}} hasten death. Aim: This study evaluated the motivations of patients expressing such a desire {{in a country with}} prohibitive legislation on euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. Design: A modified form of Grounded Theory was used. Setting/participants: Patients from the departments of palliative medicine in three hospitals in Germany were recruited when they had made a statement or request to hasten death. Participants were interviewed face to face. Recruitment was stopped with 12 participants because of data saturation. Results: Thematic analysis revealed three main motivational themes: self-determination, agony, and time. Expectations toward health professionals, attitudes toward death, and secureness related to the end of life were additional main themes emerging from the analysis. Conclusions: The desire to hasten death may be used as an extreme coping strategy to maintain control against anticipated agony. Patients expected health professionals to listen to and <b>respect</b> <b>their</b> experiences. Emerging hypotheses included the following: (a) patients try to balance life time and anticipated agony, and the perception of time is distressing in this balancing act; (b) anticipated images of agony and suffering in the dying process occur frequently and are experienced by patients as intrusive; (c) patients expressing a desire to hasten death are in need of more information about the dying process; and (d) patients wanted their caregivers to listen to and <b>respect</b> <b>their</b> <b>wish</b> to hasten death, and they did not expect the caregivers to understand this as an order to actually hasten their death...|$|R

[...] "No code" [...] is {{a reference to the}} use of [...] "code" [...] as jargon for [...] "calling in a Code Blue" [...] to alert a hospital's resuscitation team. The DNR request is usually made by the patient or health care power of attorney and allows the medical teams taking care of them to <b>respect</b> <b>their</b> <b>wishes.</b> In the health care community, allow natural death (AND) is a term that is quickly gaining favor as it focuses on what is being done, not what is being avoided. Some criticize the term [...] "do not resuscitate" [...] because of the implication of important information being withheld, while research shows that only about 5% of patients who require CPR outside the hospital and only 15% of patients who require CPR while in the hospital survive.

40|$|Objective: To obtain {{feedback}} from patients receiving palliative care {{and their relatives}} from various ethnic backgrounds about their experiences of the disclosure process and their satisfaction with information sharing during the illness. Design: A qualitative study with semistructured single interviews. Setting: Perth, Western Australia, and Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Participants: 72 participants registered with palliative care: 21 patient-family dyads in Perth and 14 dyads and 2 patients in Winnipeg. Results: Participants described their experiences in great detail. The analysis indicates that in information sharing the process {{is as important as}} the content. The timing, management, and delivery of information and perceived attitude of practitioners were critical to the process. This applied to information interactions at all stages of the illness. Main content areas mentioned related to prognosis and hope. Hope can be conveyed in different ways. Secondary information from various sources is accessed and synthesised with the primary information. All patients, regardless of origin, wanted information about their illness and wanted it fully shared with relatives. Almost all patients requested prognostic information, and all family members <b>respected</b> <b>their</b> <b>wishes.</b> Information was perceived as important for patient-family communication. Information needs of patient and family changed and diverged as illness progressed, and communication between them became less verbally explicit.

The associated factors were grouped into three components: predisposing factors (e. g. age, gender), enabling factors (e. g. education) and need factors (e. g. health-related factors). We found that living wills had been formulated by 3 % of younger people, 10 % of older people, and 23 % of the relatives of a person who died after euthanasia or assisted suicide. Most living wills concerned a request for euthanasia. In all groups, 26 - 29 % had authorized someone to make decisions if they were no longer able to do so themselves.

The first {{aim was to}} {{describe}} some aspects {{of each of the}} three perspectives in the triangular meeting between immigrant patients, interpreters and GPs, including their experiences, reflections and interactions during the consultation in primary health care. The second aim was to analyse patients' satisfaction with the consultation; whether satisfaction is influenced by respect for patients' culture, personality and wishes; and whether interpreters or GPs experience any ethical conflicts during the consultation. Methods. Using questionnaires, all three categories were asked about their opinions regarding the communication, their experiences and reflections during the consultation and the patient's satisfaction. The interpreters and GPs were asked about ethical conflicts. Results. Of the 182 respondents, 52 were patients, 65 GPs and 65 interpreters. A matched group of answers from patients, GPs and interpreters was present in 40 consultations. Eighteen of the patients experienced language difficulties. Twenty-six experienced <b>respect</b> for <b>their</b> culture; 32, <b>respect</b> for <b>their</b> personality; and 33, <b>respect</b> for <b>their</b> <b>wishes.</b> Ethical conflicts were rare.

40|$|This master work {{presents}} an action research with 5 – 6 years old children about soils and rocks. The {{observation of the}} teaching practice helps teachers {{to find out which}} methods and instruments they are using to achieve the education goals, in this case in the field of natural science, especially at developing knowledge concerning rocks. The master work wishes to check if the preschool teacher creates situations, where children are able to exchange their knowledge, experience and are possible to carry out experiments. If children participate in planning and evaluating, it is easy to <b>respect</b> <b>their</b> <b>wishes,</b> moreover, it helps the teacher to check the knowledge they have gained. At work, a preschool teacher gets a lot of experience, which leads to the development of "practical theories" that can be advanced, changed or rejected. To run this process, the reflection is needed. It works as a cyclic process among actions of thinking, future-orientation and looking back at the former work experience. All this results in professional development of the preschool teacher, better educational process and better learning conditions for children. Both, the evaluation and the reflection are fundamental for this action research. The leading, i. e. the theoretical part of this masterwork presents the field of natural science from different perspectives of modern pedagogical concept in Slovenia. Different modern ways of exchanging and accessing information allow preschool teachers to include alternative approaches and strategies at work instead of just following the official curriculum. Rapid development and constant changes are part of our everyday lives. This demands from a preschool teacher to constantly develop at work and especially, to be ready to prepare children for a life in a changing world, where the competences for lifelong learning mean much more than the quantity of learned facts that surrounds us. It is the combination of knowledge, agility and relations / orientation and standpoints. These key competences are transmittable and therefore useful in many conditions and circumstances. They are multifunctional, because they can be used to reach various goals, to solve different sorts of problems and to undertake all sorts of tasks. If natural science themes are appropriately introduced to children, they are able to use their knowledge also in other similar situations. ...|$|R
6000|$|The Congress {{remained}} in session fifty-one days. Every subject, according to Adams, was discussed [...] "with a moderation, an acuteness, and a minuteness {{equal to that}} of Queen Elizabeth's privy council." [...] [Footnote: Letter to William Tudor, 29th Sept., 1774.] The papers issued by it have deservedly been pronounced masterpieces of practical talent and political wisdom. Chatham, when speaking on the subject in the House of Lords, could not restrain his enthusiasm. [...] "When your lordships," [...] said he, [...] "look at the papers transmitted to us from America; when you consider their decency, firmness, and wisdom, you cannot but <b>respect</b> <b>their</b> cause, and <b>wish</b> to make it your own. For myself, I must declare and avow that, in the master states of the world, I know not the people, or senate, who, in such a complication of difficult circumstances, can stand in preference to the delegates of America assembled in General Congress at Philadelphia." ...|$|R

40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on the European Landscape Convention's {{implementation}} in landscape planning and then the process of determination the target landscape characteristics in cooperation with the public. At the same time, the issues of participatory planning and its involvement in the planning processes are discussed. The cadastral territory of the villages of Vědomice and Černěves was chosen as the model territory. The practical part concentrates on processing the landscape analysis of the territory. The next step is determining the characteristics of the landscape in cooperation with the public. On the basis of a specified analysis, specific values, problems and conflicts in the territory are set, representing the basis for establishing the alternative scenarios of the landscape development and the subsequent design of the target characteristics of the landscape. The public is actively involved in the process of selecting the alternative scenarios and in the subsequent design of the target characteristics of the landscape, with the <b>respect</b> to <b>their</b> <b>wishes</b> and requirements The result of the processing is the design of the target characteristics of the landscape, which conceptually leads to a balanced, harmonious landscape that is habitable for the local residents with sustainable development of the landscape. Furthermore, the design of landscaping follows, solving the problems and values in the landscape. The resulting design of the target characteristics and associated landscaping addresses the territory sensitively. Cultural and historical values are restored, the permeability of the landscape is developed and the visible landmarks of the landscape are reestablished. The share of grassland is increased and large blocks of arable land are divided by interactive elements, consisting of groves, baulks and fruit alleys which restore the original character of the landscape of the Elbe river valley. The whole design is a result of mutual blending of an expert assessment and the views and demands of the local residents...|$|R
