She is a skilled sword-fighter, but is followed by the dead spirits of baby chicks, who believe her to be their mother, and <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> her, thus interfering in her sword-training.

60|$|At {{this date}} the Confederate Army of the Tennessee was {{extended}} {{in a line}} with its right <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> the Tennessee and its left <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> the Mississippi. Its rear <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> the rugged stone hills of the Chickasaba range, while its front <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> the marshes and bayous of the Yazoo. Having thus--as far as we understand military matters--both its flanks covered and its rear protected, its position was one which we ourselves consider very comfortable.|$|R

30|$|It is {{seen that}} the {{practical}} range of relative stiffness of chimney is 1  < K CS <  65, whereas that of raft is 0.001  < K RS <  0.5. The upper limit of K CS represents chimney <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> loose sand, whereas the lower limit of K CS represents chimney <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> rock. Hence the lower limit of K CS points out little interaction effect with soil. The lower limit of K RS represents a flexible raft <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> rock and the upper limit of K RS represents a virtually rigid foundation <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> loose sand.|$|R

5|$|A {{couple of}} days before the Varsity Match, talk in the press had been of Geen's likely {{selection}} for England for the forthcoming Home Nations Championship. Geen and Poulton, who together were considered the scoring force of the Oxford team, were both selected to play for England in the second trial match against The North in Leeds. Although Geen scored a try in the game, his form was lacking and he was outshone by Poulton. So for the third and final trial, England versus The <b>Rest</b> <b>on</b> 7 January 1911, Geen was not selected.|$|E
5|$|A pair {{of large}} canvases with hunting dogs by Jean-Baptiste Oudry (1742), now {{hanging in the}} Salle du synode, once hung in the Parisian hôtel particulier of Samuel-Jacques Bernard. The three {{paintings}} in the chapel are copies of works by Antonio da Correggio: Adoration of the Shepherds, Virgin and Child with Sts Jerome and Madeleine, and The <b>Rest</b> <b>on</b> the Return from Egypt. They were made in 1724 in Modena and Parma by Robert deSéry (1686–1733) for Armand Gaston, whom he had met in Rome the same year. DeSéry would later provide many other paintings for the cardinal's apartments, all of them copies of paintings by greater masters. Napoleon's green bed is an authentic work by Jacob-Desmalter.|$|E

5|$|As {{an active}} civil airfield, {{operations}} at Duxford are {{regulated by the}} Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). In 2002 a privately operated Aero L-39 Albatros suffered a braking failure on landing, overran the runway and came to <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> the M11 motorway, a student pilot being killed after ejecting at ground level. An Air Accidents Investigation Branch inquiry recommended a review of arrangements for aircraft taking off or landing towards the M11. As a result, the CAA and Duxford agreed {{to a reduction in}} the runway's 1500m declared length, from 1350m to 1200m, in order to provide a greater margin of error.|$|E
5|$|During the Gallipoli Campaign, Burgess, now a major, {{commanded}} the 9th (Tasmanian) Battery. However, the guns of his battery were not landed until early May 1915. He {{and his men}} took over the guns of 7th Battery, allowing its personnel some <b>rest.</b> <b>On</b> 5 May, while reporting the location of Turkish artillery positions to his commander, Colonel Charles Rosenthal, he was wounded by shelling. His injuries required hospital treatment but {{he returned to the}} front on 17 May. Eventually poor health led to his evacuation from Gallipoli in October 1915. For his services during the campaign, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. Promoted to lieutenant colonel in March 1916 and given command of the 3rd Australian Field Artillery Brigade, he served on the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|Following the Battle of Uman Panzer-Regiment 2 {{was given}} a <b>rest.</b> <b>On</b> 8 September the attack resumed and the {{regiment}} crossed the Dnjepr {{on the night of}} 11/12 September. Together with the I. battalion of Schützen-Regiment 79 they started their attacked on Lubny and ambushed and destroyed a Soviet supply convoy. The attack on Lubny ended on 14 September. The Kiev pocket was sealed when panzers of the 3. Panzer-Division linked up with Panzer-Regiment 2 on 15 September 1941. The spearhead of Panzergruppe 2, under Guderian and Panzergruppe 1, under Von Kleist had captured 50 Soviet Divisions. Panzer-Regiment 2 was then dispatched to prevent Soviet troops from escaping the pocket. For Panzer-Regiment 2 the battle of Kiev continued until 4 October 1941.|$|E

5|$|In 1889 Waterloo Station (renamed from Waterloo Bridge {{station in}} 1886) was {{equipped}} with new signals, which required a gantry spanning all the lines into the station. In return for the LSWR cladding the LNC's entrance on Westminster Bridge Road with white glazed brick, the LNC gave consent for the stanchion supporting the gantry to <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> the LNC's platform, while reserving the right to demand the gantry be removed.

When Alboin retired for his midday <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> June 28, care was taken to leave {{the door open and}} unguarded. Alboin's sword was also removed, leaving him defenceless when Peredeo entered his room and killed him. Alboin's remains were allegedly buried beneath the palace steps.|$|E
5|$|Indoor {{residual}} spraying is the spraying of insecticides on {{the walls}} inside a home. After feeding, many mosquitoes <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> a nearby surface while digesting the bloodmeal, so if the walls of houses have been coated with insecticides, the resting mosquitoes can be killed before they can bite another person and transfer the malaria parasite. As of 2006, the World Health Organization recommends 12 insecticides in IRS operations, including DDT and the pyrethroids cyfluthrin and deltamethrin. This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under the Stockholm Convention, which prohibits its agricultural use. One problem with all forms of IRS is insecticide resistance. Mosquitoes affected by IRS tend to rest and live indoors, and due to the irritation caused by spraying, their descendants tend to rest and live outdoors, meaning that they are less affected by the IRS.|$|E

5|$|Most terns breed on open sandy or rocky {{areas on}} coasts and islands. The yellow-billed, large-billed, and black-fronted terns breed only on rivers, and common, least and little terns also {{sometimes}} use inland locations. The marsh terns, Trudeau's tern and some Forster's terns nest in inland marshes. The black noddy {{and the white}} tern nest above ground level on cliffs or in trees. Migratory terns move to the coast after breeding, and most species winter near land, although some marine species, like the Aleutian tern, may wander far from land. The sooty tern is entirely oceanic when not breeding, and healthy young birds are not seen on land {{for up to five}} years after fledging until they return to breed. They lack waterproof plumage, so they cannot <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> the sea. Where they spend the years prior to breeding is unknown.|$|E
