A highly accurate and efficient numerical algorithm, {{which is based on}} the Chebyshev spectral method, is developed to integrate a single-particle Liouville-von Neumann equation, and the two longstanding limitations of quantum dissipation theory are resolved in the context of quantum transport. Its computational time scales to O(N 3) with N being the number of orbitals involved, which leads to a reality for the quantum mechanical simulation of <b>real</b> <b>open</b> <b>systems</b> containing hundreds or thousands of atomic orbitals.

40|$|Processes {{occurring}} in <b>real</b> <b>open</b> <b>systems</b> {{are far from}} equilibrium state and they can lead to synergetic effects, which are caused by coordinated behavior of system units. Traditional methods of analysis often just establish such behavior, {{but they are not}} able to reveal the mechanism of the process in full measure and to explain observed structural modifications from the standard positions. A qualitatively new approach to the research of nonlinear effects in complex systems is considered in the paper. From the positions of synergetics, a structural state, which appears in the system due to nonlinear processes, can be considered as a multifractal. Synergetic parameters of the structure calculated at the multifractal analysis give additional information about occurring modifications and promote discovering of process mechanism.

However, since {{the interaction between the}} quantum system and the noisy environment is inevitable, it is essential to protect quantum correlation from lost in the environment and to characterize its dynamical behavior in the <b>real</b> <b>open</b> <b>systems.</b> Here we showed experimentally in the solid-state P:Si system the existence of a stable interval for the quantum correlation in the beginning until a critical time t_c ≈ 166 ns of the transition from classical to quantum decoherence. To protect the quantum correlation, we achieved the extension of the critical time by 50 times to 8 μs by applying a two-flip dynamical decoupling (DD) pulse sequence. Moreover, we observed the phenomenon of the revival of quantum correlation, as well as classical correlation. The experimental observation of a non-decay interval for quantum correlation and the great extension of it in an important solid-state system with genuine noise makes the use quantum discord as physical resources in quantum information processing more practicable.

Borrowing from these everyday understandings, and influenced by their formalizations, the notion of institution has been used within the agents community to model and implement a variety of socio-technical systems. Their main purpose is to enable and regulate the interaction among autonomous agents in order to achieve some collective endeavour. In this chapter we present and compare three frameworks for agent-based institutions (i) ANTE, a model that considers electronic institutions as computational realizations of adaptive artificial environments for governing multi-agent interactions; (ii) OCeAN, extended in MANET, a model for specifying Artificial Institutions (AIs), situated in agent environments, which can be used in the design and implementation of different open interaction systems; and (iii) a conceptual core model for Electronic Institutions (EIs), extended with EIDE, based on open, social, decomposable and dialogical interactions.
