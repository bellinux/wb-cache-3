Here we select only the best sub-band out of the 24 possible ones that gives fewest bit errors. The channel coefficient vector h 1 of the best sub-band consists of a concatenated vector of {h 11 h 12 } where each of h 11 and h 12 comprise 15 channel coefficients in frequency domain of the applied time slot to RX antennas 1 and 2, respectively (see Figure  4). Similarly, h 2 describes the channel coefficients {h 21 h 22 } of the same time slot for the data stream 2 from the TX antenna 2 to both RX antennas. It is noted that in simulations, we evaluate the spatial correlation of parallel MIMO channels which takes into account the spatial correlation characteristics of both the TX and RX antennas. The correlation coefficient ρ in (9) for each time slot of data packet transmission is calculated using a MATLAB™ function 'corrcoef(h 1, h 2)’. It is noted that the 3 GPP SCM model enables to integrate the actual TX and RX antenna patterns into a radio channel simulation. Therefore, the antenna and beam domain correlation values are obtained by exactly the same simulation model. The only difference is the different antenna and Butler beam patterns at the BS end (shown in Figure  3) which were integrated into the 3 GPP SCM model.

50|$|The {{satellite}} observations essentially yielded highly accurate relative positions of stars {{with respect to}} each other, throughout the measurement period (1989-93). In the absence of direct observations of extragalactic sources (apart from marginal observations of quasar 3C273) the resulting rigid reference frame was transformed to an inertial frame of reference linked to extragalactic sources. This allows surveys at different wavelengths to be directly correlated with the Hipparcos stars, and ensures that the catalogue proper motions are, as far as possible, kinematically non-rotating. The determination of the relevant three solid-body rotation angles, and the three time-dependent rotation rates, was conducted and completed {{in advance of the}} catalogue publication. This resulted in an accurate but indirect link to an inertial, extragalactic, reference frame. A variety of methods to establish this reference frame link before catalogue publication were included and appropriately weighted: interferometric observations of radio stars by VLBI networks, MERLIN and VLA; observations of quasars relative to Hipparcos stars using CCDs, photographic plates, and the Hubble Space Telescope; photographic programmes to determine stellar proper motions with respect to extragalactic objects (Bonn, Kiev, Lick, Potsdam, Yale/San Juan); and comparison of Earth rotation parameters obtained by VLBI and by ground-based optical observations of Hipparcos stars. Although very different in terms of instruments, observational methods and objects involved, the various techniques generally agreed to within 10 milliarc-sec in the orientation and 1 milliarc-sec/year in the rotation of the system. From appropriate weighting, the coordinate axes defined by the published catalogue are believed to be aligned with the extragalactic <b>radio</b> <b>frame</b> to within ±0.6 milliarc-sec at the epoch J1991.25, and non-rotating with respect to distant extragalactic objects to within ±0.25 milliarc-sec/yr.|$|E

The two-dimension displacement estimation method of elasticity imaging adopts an initial estimation step which is rough but robust and a fine searching step which is accurate but needs the image with higher relativity so as to simultaneously achieve high speed and accuracy. 一种弹性成像的二维位移估计方法，包括步骤：对待处理的超声图像的第一射频帧与第二射频帧，用具有鲁棒性的匹配算法进行二维初始位移估计；用得到的二维初始位移估计对第一射频帧图像进行调整，使得相比于原始的第一帧，调整后的第一帧和原始的第二帧之间的相关性更高；将原始的第二射频帧与调整后的第一射频帧，通过亚像素位移估计算法进行位移估计；将所得的二维初始位移估计结果与亚像素位移估计算法所得位移估计结果进行合成处理，得到总体的二维位移估计。本发明的弹性成像的二维位移估计方法，采用粗略但鲁棒的初始估计步骤以及一个准确但需要图像相关性较高的精细搜索步骤，同时达到高速和准确。Department of Health Technology and InformaticsInventor name used in this publication: 郑永平, Zheng YongpingInventor name used in this publication: 周永进Inventor name used in this publication: 黄铮铭Title in Traditional Chinese: 彈性成像的二維位移估計方法Chin...|$|R

40|$|A barrage {{relay network}} (BRN) is a {{broadcast}} oriented ad hoc network involving autonomous cooperative communication, a slotted time-division frame format, and a coarse slot-level synchronization. While inherently a broadcast protocol, BRNs can support unicast transmission by superimposing {{a plurality of}} controlled barrage regions (CBRs) onto the network. Within each CBRs, a new packet is injected by the unicast source during the first time slot of each new <b>radio</b> <b>frame.</b> When a CBRs is sufficiently long that a packet {{might not be able}} to reach the other end within a <b>radio</b> <b>frame,</b> multiple packets can be active at the same time via spatial pipelining, resulting in interference within the CBRs.

40|$|Time {{synchronization}} {{is required}} in mobile terminals operating in any digital radio system to detect the <b>radio</b> <b>frame</b> start of the received signal. The main operation performed in the synchronization procedure is {{the correlation between the}} received signal and the known synchronization sequences transmitted in each frame. The UMTS standard for TDD Low Chip Rate (TDD-LCR) option (integrated by 3 GPP in release four of the UTRA standard) defines 32 different synchronization codes (SYNC sequences). Each base station transmits one of these sequences always at the same position of a <b>radio</b> <b>frame</b> and the used sequence defines already a group of base stations to which this sequence belongs to [1]. In UMTS FDD or in the high chip rate TDD one common primary synchronization sequence is used which does not exist in the TDD-LCR. This forces the mobile set to calculate the correlation between the received signal and all 32 SYNC sequences and thus increases the computational complexity enormously. In this paper we propose a low complex algorithm for the detection of the <b>radio</b> <b>frame</b> start and of the sequence number using an approximation with lowpass filtering and sample rate reduction in the frequency domain. The performance loss of this approximation is quite small and an implementation in currently available signal processors is possible.

30|$|Performance {{results for}} three metrics are obtained, namely the {{achieved}} energy savings {{in the small}} cell networks, the average UE throughput and the average packet sojourn time, i.e., the average time which a packet spends in the network before it is fully transmitted. To compute the achieved energy savings, the state of each small cell (on state or sleep state) is recorded at each <b>radio</b> <b>frame.</b> Depending on its state, a small cell consumes either 100 % of energy (for on state small cells) or a reduced percentage of energy (for sleep state small cells), as indicated in Table 2. Averaging these percentages over all the small cells and over the whole simulation time frame then yields the achievable energy savings quantity. The computation of the average UE throughput is performed by recording the size of each packet received by UEs within a <b>radio</b> <b>frame,</b> both from macro cells and small cells, divided by the duration of a frame (10 ms), and then by globally averaging these values. Finally, the average packet sojourn time is computed by recording the time each packet spends in the network before its complete transmission, then averaging all the recorded values.|$|E
30|$|When the {{synchronization}} {{procedure is}} performed through the macro cell air interface, the small cell needs {{to detect the}} PSS and SSS of the macro cell it is connected to. To detect the first signal (PSS), the small cell performs matched filtering on each possible PSS pattern to determine the appropriate timing. The detection of the second signal (SSS) will determine the physical cell ID of the macro cell. This is necessary to identify the macro cell the small cell needs to synchronize to. Depending on {{the proximity of the}} small cell to the macro cell and on the channel conditions, these signals might not be detected with 100 % accuracy from the first attempt. However, in PCC systems, it is safe to assume that small cells are located {{in the vicinity of the}} macro cell they are connected to by backhaul link. Hence, a 100 % detection accuracy assumption is realistic. Since PSS and SSS are both transmitted twice per <b>radio</b> <b>frame</b> (10 ms), and given the 100 % detection rate, we can assume that detecting the PSS and the SSS can be done in a <b>radio</b> <b>frame</b> (i.e., 10 ms).
