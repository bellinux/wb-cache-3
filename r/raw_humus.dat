50|$|Heron Island has notably rich {{soil for}} a {{tropical}} coral cay, {{particularly in the}} dense southern forest. This {{is due to the}} presence {{of tens of thousands of}} wedge-tailed shearwaters (Puffinus pacificus) during breeding season. These birds disturb the humus as they dig their nesting burrows, and thus prevent the formation of Jemo soil, a phosphatic hardpan topped off by <b>raw</b> <b>humus.</b> The hardpan is formed by leaching of surface- or tree-nesting seabirds' guano in the absence of burrowing animals.|$|E
50|$|Missen {{are formed}} on base-poor soils {{that have a}} {{tendency}} to become waterlogged. In addition, other climatic factors such as high levels of precipitation, a relatively short vegetation period and a cool, moist, montane climate are basic pre-requisites. Human exploitation may also favour the emergence of missen. The introduction of stall feeding in the 19th century forced forest farmers to use the ground vegetation as bedding. On poor bunter sandstone soils <b>raw</b> <b>humus</b> is laid down {{as a result of the}} constant removal of nutrients. The blueberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), an indicator of acidicism, becomes the dominant type of dwarf shrub. Moor grass (Molinia caerulea, M. arundinacea) colonises the shore areas in dense tussocks.|$|E
50|$|A highly {{robust and}} {{ubiquitous}} fungus, E. nigrum has an almost global spread, {{occurring in the}} Americas, Asia, and Europe. Spores of E. nigrum have been cultured {{from a variety of}} environments, predominantly soil (i.e. peat, forest floor, <b>raw</b> <b>humus,</b> compost, tundra, sewage) and sand (e.g., dunes, saline sands). It is a saprophytic fungus, forming pustules (composed of sporodochia and conidia) on dead and dying plants. This species is commonly found growing on cereals and seeds, as well as other crops including corn, beans, potatoes, peas and peaches. It has been found to grow colonies on leaves submersed in water as cold as 0 C, and is considered a facultative marine fungus. It is capable of colonizing algae and marsh grasses. In indoor environments, E. nigrum has been found on paintings and wallpaper, cotton and textiles, in dust, and in air. It is tolerant of changes in water availability, and hyphal growth has been found to resume within an hour of exposure to water.|$|E
40|$|A key {{function}} {{in the production of}} drinking water is to separate the organic matter pre-sent in the raw water as it has a great impact on the water quality; organic compounds con-tributes to a variety of hygienic and aesthetic water quality problems. The content of organic matter in Nordic watercourses has increased, most likely depend-ing on climate change, where the precipitation is an important factor. Increased precipita-tion results in more colored water containing more humus. Löfgren et al. (2002) estimated that the humus content in Swedish surface waters could increase with 26 % in the future. According to the model estimated by Larsen et. al (2011), the median value of TOC in Nor-wegian lakes could increase by 65 %. Waterworks that purifies <b>raw</b> water containing <b>humus</b> will be affected by these changes in the humus content. Svenskt Vatten AB (2007) predicted that the cost to separate the increasing humus levels caused by climate change in the years 2011 to 2040 will amount to about 400 millions. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the separation of organic matter from surface waters by artificial groundwater recharge. Additional objectives were to study how the separation of organic matter changes over time, both in terms of retention time and the run time, and in relation to different types of plants. Three existing drinking water facilities with artificial groundwater recharge has been studied, Gäddvik, Forslunda and Wifsta, and also the startup of a new bank filtration facility in Rökebo was studied. This work was made by compiling several years of sampling series of water chemistry data from each existing facility, primarily the parameter CODMn. The com-piling has been done for both surface water (before infiltration) and raw water (after infiltra-tion). Through test-series of water chemistry from the plants as a basis, the report estimates on trends, seasonal variations, and comparisons between facilities. In addition, sampling at the startup of the infiltration facility at Rökebo was done, to see the development of treat-ment over time and in relation residence time. Based on the compilation made in this work it can be concluded that variations in con-tent of CODMn over short time intervals occurs, both in surface water and raw water. Studies of longer time series show weak trends that the amount of organic matter in the river water is slightly increasing. The raw water in the wells at Gäddvik and Wifsta also showed trends in increasing concentrations of CODMn with a low degree of explanation. The efficiency of the separation of organic material, measured as CODMn, did not change significantly over time and the average of the three surveyed plants in operation was at Gäddvik 87 %, at Forslunda 90 % and in Wifsta 68 % with the bank filtration in Rökebo, Sandviken, a separation of 71 % of the organic matter was achieved, during the sampling pe-riod. In Sandviken the water, however, requires further purification in terms of the organic material since the limit was exceeded in the raw water. However, it can be concluded that in comparison to using surface water directly as a source of raw water for drinking water pro-duction the need of purification reduced greatly to the use of artificial groundwater.

In the United States it is specifically located in southeast Alaska, California and eastern Montana. While in Canada it {{can be found in the}} providences of British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Quebec. Lanky Moss can also be found in parts of Europe, mostly in mountainous regions where moisture can be trapped in shaded pockets of the mountains. It grows in north-western Europe in countries such as Norway, Iceland and Greenland. Lanky Moss is usually a coastal species that grows in moist environments, preferably in shady, dark locations. It can be found in low elevation to subalpine elevations of 4,000 ft. In coniferous forests it is a dominant species of moss that covers the forest floor. It commonly covers decomposing wood such as a fallen trees or rotting logs. Lanky Moss can also grow on rocks. It can also take on epiphytic qualities and grow at the base of living trees. Lanky Moss grows exceptionally well on soil types such as <b>raw</b> <b>humus,</b> acid humus or peat. This is due to the amount of moisture, decaying matter and nitrogen in these top layers of soil that Lanky Moss can thrive on. Rhytidiadeplhus loreus is a flourishing and abundant moss that is not at risk of extinction. It is not listed on the COSEWIC website.|$|E

For {{ecological}} characterisation of the experimental material, most of these species were {{tested for the ability}} to produce the extra-cellular enzymes cellulase, pectinase, proteinase and laccase. The mycorrhiza-formers were clearly inferior to the litter-decomposers in this respect, although some deviations were noted. Of the synthetic nitrogen sources investigated, ammonium and asparagine were most readily utilised by the fungi, followed by glycine, acetamide, nitrate and glucosamine in that order. Unusable sources were diethylamine, proline and pyridine. Nitrite had a toxic effect throughout. Litter decomposers tended to be non-nitrate users but could more easily utilise amide nitrogen than mycorrhiza-formers. The result from an experimental series having <b>raw</b> <b>humus</b> as the only nitrogen source indicated that the mycorrhiza-forming fungi, like most of the litter-decomposers, could utilise to a very limited extent or not at all the nitrogen bound in the humus.

40|$|SUMMARY: A {{series of}} fungi {{with varying degrees}} of {{sensitivity}} to soil fungistasis was selected as the result of agar disk and buried-slide tests with 17 fungi and one soil. Six out of 7 different soils exhibited a spectrum of inhibition of the test series of fungi {{similar to that of the}} first soil tested. The exception was a very acid <b>raw</b> <b>humus</b> soil which only inhibited the acid-sensitive fungus Acrostulugmus cinna-barinus. Fertilizer treatments of two series of plots a t Rothamsted were found to affect soil fungistasis only through their influence on soil pH. Inhibitory effect decreased with increasing soil acidity, being absent from the most acid plot tested. From the results of experiments in which three fungi were pre-incubated before exposure to the influence of soil, it is suggested that spores are most sensitive to soil fungistasis at an early stage in the process of germination. Reference was made in a previous paper (Jackson, 1958) to the numerous reports which suggest that factors which inhibit the germination of fungal spores and, to a lesser extent, the vegetative growth of fungi, are of wide-spread occurrence in the soil.

40|$|Fodsol soils {{constitute}} {{a large proportion}} of the soils of Eastern Canada. They are developed under woodland in cool humid conditions where rainfall exceeds evaporation. The profile from the surface downward consists essentially of an organic layer, a leached layer, and a layer of accumulation just above the parent rock. Thus the simplest podso 1 profile consists of three horizons, namely: Ao ‘ the <b>raw</b> <b>humus</b> layer; A 2, the leached siliceous layer; B, the layer of accumulation of sesquioxides. The Ao horizon of acid peaty organic matter is considered essential to the development of a true podsol. G. W. Robinson makes the following statement: “ [...] It would appear that an acid reaction is not in itself sufficient to cause podsolization. This may be readily shown in the laboratory by allowing 0. 1 N solutions of hydrochloric acid and oxalic acid, respectively, to percolate through ferruginous sand. Alghough the pH of the hydrochloric acid is lower than that of the oxalic acid, the solvent action of the latter acid is considerably greater and quickly leads to a bleaching by removal of ferric oxide [...] . ” R.

40|$|Gravelly clay loamy and clayey soils {{developed}} from the derivatives of ultramafic rocks of the dunite-harzburgite complex of the Rai-Iz massif in the Polar Urals have been studied. They are represented by raw-humus pelozems (weakly developed clayey soils) under conditions of perfect drainage on steep slopes and by the gleyzems (Gleysols) with vivid gley color patterns in the eluvial positions on leveled elements of the relief. The magnesium released from the silicates with the high content of this element (mainly from olivine) specifies the neutral-alkaline reaction in these soils. Cryoturbation, the accumulation of <b>raw</b> <b>humus,</b> the impregnation of the soil mass with humic substances, gleyzation, and the ferrugination of the gleyed horizons are also clearly pronounced in the studied soils. Despite the high pH values, the destruction of supergene smectites in the upper horizons and ferrugination (the accumulation of iron hydroxides) in the microfissures dissecting the grains of olivine, pyroxene, and serpentine, and in decomposing plant tissues take place. The development of these processes {{may be related to}} the local acidification (neutralization) of the soil medium under the impact of biota and carbonic acids.

40|$|We {{applied the}} {{simulation}} model ROMUL of {{soil organic matter}} dynamics in order to analyse and predict forest soil organic matter (SOM) changes following stand growth and also to identify gaps of data and modelling problems. SOM build-up was analysed (a) from bare sand to forest soil during a primary succession in Scots pine forest and (b) on mature forest soil under Douglas fir plantations {{as an example of}} secondary succession in The Netherlands. As some of the experimental data were unreliable we compiled a set of various scenarios with different soil moisture regime, initial SOM pools and amount and quality of above and below ground litter input. This allowed us to find the scenarios that reflect the SOM dynamics more realistically. In the Scots pine forest, total litter input was estimated as 0. 50 kg m- 2 year- 1. Two scenarios were defined for the test runs: (a) forest floor moisture regimes—‘dry, mesic and hydric’ and (b) augmenting a root litter pool with three ratios of needles and branches to roots: 1 : 1, 1 : 1. 5 and 1 : 2. 0. The scenario finally compiled had the following characteristics: (a) climate for dry site with summer drought and high winter moisture of forest floor; (b) a litter input of 0. 25 kg m- 2 year- 1 above ground and 0. 50 kg m- 2 year- 1 below ground; (c) a low nitrogen and ash content in all litter fall fractions. The test runs for the estimation of the initial SOM pools and the amount and proportion of above and below ground litter fall were also performed in the Douglas fir plantation. The inputs of above ground litter tested in various combinations were 0. 30 and 0. 60 kg m- 2 year- 1, and below ground litter 0. 30, 0. 60 and 0. 90 kg m- 2 year- 1. The scenario that fitted the experimental data had an SOM pool of 20 – 25 kg m- 2, an aboveground litter input of 0. 6 kg m- 2 year- 1 and a below ground litter input of 0. 9 kg m- 2 year- 1. The long-term simulation corresponded well with the observed patterns of soil organic matter accumulation associated with the forest soil development in primary and secondary succession. During primary succession in Scots pine forest on dry sand there is a consistent accumulation of a <b>raw</b> <b>humus</b> forest floor. The soil dynamics in the Douglas fir plantation also coincide with the observed patterns of SOM changes during the secondary succession, with SOM decreasing significantly under young forest, and SOM being restored in the older stands...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the development of tree communities from mid- to late-successional stages in unmanaged Hylocomium-Myrtillus (HMT) forests in northern Finland using a chronosequence approach. More specifically, this thesis adressed the following study questions: (1) What is the spatial pattern of the overall tree community and does this overall pattern changes as the forest`s successional stage changes from mid- to late-successional? (2) What are the spatial patterns of small and large trees and how they differ from mid- to late-successional stages? (3) Is the occurrence of P. abies is related to Betula spp. in mid- to late-successional stages and does this potential relation changes as the forest`s successional stage changes from mid- to late-successional? (4) Does the tree population displays a mosaic of small patches of P. abies and Betula spp. trees over succession from mid- to late-successional stages? The study {{was carried out in}} the Värriö Strict Nature Reserve in north-eastern Finland in 2011. Living and dead trees were recorded within 3 transects (300 m long, 40 m wide) in 3 different stands representing differing midto late-succesional stages from 180 years to at least 350 years. The stands were classified according to their species composition in Betula spp. dominated, mixed P. abies-Betula spp. and P. abies dominated. Finally, spatial patterns were analysed using Ripley`s K-function. The spatial tree patterns were predominantly clustered and this pattern did not vary much over succession. Small trees were generally more clustered than larger trees and regular distributions did not occur. Saplings of both species were predominantly attracted to mature trees of the same species. This, and the repulsion between living mature P. abies and mature Betula spp. suggests clumps composed of only one species and thereby a mosaic of small patches of P. abies and Betula spp. in mid- to late-successional forest stages. At the same time, a successive dependency of P. abies on Betula spp can be rejected. The lack of regular distributions implies a minor importance of competition in governing the spatial pattering of HMT-forests. In conclusion, suitable regeneration microsites and vegetative regeneration strategies can be assumed to outrun competitive effects on spatial structure {{in the presence of a}} thick <b>raw</b> <b>humus</b> layer in HMT-forests. Despite evidence of facilitative effects due the observed intensive clumping, the facilitative effects of Betula spp. on P. abies reported by Doležal et al. (2006) could not be shown in this study. This study thus suggests that facilitation is merely restricted to inter-species tree-to-tree interactions. HMT-forests have barely been studied to date. Concrete scientific benefits by this study are found in its contribution to investigate the actual point process that generates the observed patterns by fitting appropriate point-process models to the observed pattern and evaluate their power. Ultimately, the results derived from this study could thereby contribute to formulate plausible hypotheses concerning the causes for spatial pattering in HMT-forests which could be tested in experimental studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{largest and}} the most {{coherent}} complexes of natural spruce stands in Croatia are currently distributed in the altimontane and subalpine vegetation belt of Velebit over an area of 3165 ha and altitudes ranging from 1100 to almost 1600 m. Past phytocoenological research into spruce forests in northern Velebit distinguishes three different associations: frost valleys of Štirovača and Apatišanska Duliba support the altimontane spruce forest with bastard agrimony (Aremonio-Piceetum Horvat 1938), shallower sink holes and slopes descending from the surrounding tops contain the altimontane-subalpine spruce forest with Laserpitium krapfii (Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum Vukelić et al. 2010), while rocky tops, hips, karrens and ridges feature the subalpine spruce forest with small-reed (Calamagrostio variae-Piceetum Bertović 1975). These associations are distributed as azonal, microclimatically and edaphically conditioned associations, of which spruce forest with bastard agrimony occurs in the belt of Dinaric beech-fir forest (Omphalodo-Fagetum) while the two others grow in a higher belt of subalpine beech forest with buttercup (Ranunculo platanifoliae-Fagetum). Their mutual differences result from ecological factors which are decisive for their occurrence and distribution. Of these, the edaphic relationships which we explored in this work draw particular interest. Composite samples {{were taken from the}} top layer up to 5 cm deep (13 composite samples composed of 9 individual samples each), pedological profiles were opened (11 profiles), and soil samples were taken by pedogenetic horizons within pedological research in three spruce communities: altimontane spruce forest with bastard agrimony (Aremonio-Piceetum), altimontane-subalpine spruce forest with Laserpitium krapfii (Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum), and subalpine spruce forest with small-reed (Calamagrostio-Piceetum) in the area of northern Velebit and Štirovača. Composite samples, taken from the top soil layer up to 5 cm deep, consisted of 9 samples, each taken at a distance of 1 m in a cross pattern. Soil samples were analyzed by means of the following laboratory methods: determination of pH values (HRN ISO 10390 : 2005), determination of CaCO 3 content (HRN ISO 10693 : 2004), determination of organic and total carbon and nitrogen with dry combustion (HRN ISO 10694 : 2004, HRN ISO 13878 : 2004), determination of concentrations of Pb, Zn, Cu and Cd (HRN ISO 11466 : 2004), and determination of the granulometric soil composition (HRN ISO 11277 : 2004). Descriptive statistics were made for all the samples by the investigated phytocoenosis. Variance analysis was used to test the differences between the composite soil samples for the layer of up to 5 cm in depth. Statistica 7. 0 software was used for this purpose. The analyses of composite soil samples taken from a depth of 5 cm in three different spruce communities (Aremonio-Piceetum, Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum and Calamagrostio-Piceetum) showed than the lowest pH value was recorded in the community Aremonio-Piceetum, followed by the community Calamagrostio-Piceetum, while the highest value was recorded in the community Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum. The average pH (H 2 O) value in the community Aremonio-Piceetum reaches 4. 35, in Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum it is 5. 56 and in Calamagrostio-Piceetum it is 5. 23. In terms of pH values for soil depths of up to 5 cm, the communities Aremonio-Piceetum and Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum (pH H 2 O, p= 0. 01447; pH CaCl 2, p= 0. 01668) show a statistically significant difference. In all the communities the surface soil layer is richly humous and well supplied with nitrogen. It is the richest in the community Calamagrostio-Piceetum, where the average value of C org amounts to 131. 6 g kg– 1 and N tot. to 9. 3 g kg– 1 (Table 3). The C : N ratio in all the three communities is favourable and ranges between 11 and 15. The average depth of the humus-accumulative horizon amounting to 6. 5 cm is the lowest in the community Aremonio-Piceetum. It is higher in the community Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum where it reaches 7. 5 cm and the highest in the community Calamagrostio-Piceetum, where it is 21 cm. The content of pH values, C org., N tot. in the hummus-accumulative horizon shows similar values and an identical trend to composite soil samples at a depth of up to 5 cm. In terms of the argyle-accumulative and cambic horizon, the lowest pH value is observed in the community Aremonio-Piceetum, where the average pH (H 2 O) value is 5. 30. In the community Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum, the average pH (H 2 O) value is 6. 92. The highest pH value is observed in the community Calamagrostio-Piceetum, where the average pH (H 2 O) value reaches 7. 21, but it is only one profile opened in the shallow and distinctly skeletal calcocambisol. All the soils have a texture ranging from silty to clayey loam. Soil reaction was the only parameter to show statistically significant differences for the top soil layer. These differences relate to the communities Aremonio-Piceetum and Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum. The lowest pH value in the community Aremonio-Piceetum is conditioned by acid parent material, flat relief which additionally favours the podzolization process in the perhumid climate, while specific microclimatic conditions, frost sites and high air humidity cause more intensive accumulations of <b>raw</b> <b>humus.</b> In relation to the pH reaction, the lowest acidity is displayed by the association Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum, as confirmed by phytocoenological research (Vukelić et al. 2010), according to which this community, compared to others, has the biggest number of species of the order Fagetalia. These species are dominant in adjacent, mainly neutrophilic beech and beech-fir forests. All the three studied communities, Aremonio-Piceetum, Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum and CalamagrostioPiceetum, manifested high Pb contamination in the surface soil layer of up 5 cm. The average Pb content (median) in the community Aremonio-Piceetum amounts to 54. 5 mg kg– 1, in the community Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum to 65. 0 mg kg– 1, and in the community Calamagrostio-Piceetum to 54. 7 mg kg– 1. The top soil layer of 5 cm in the communities Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum and Calamagrostio-Piceetum also manifested high Zn and Cd contamination. The average content (median) in the community Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum for Zn is 101. 0 mg kg– 1 and for Cd it is 1. 0 mg kg– 1, whereas in the community Calamagrostio-Piceetum it is 75. 0 mg kg– 1 for Zn and 1. 9 mg kg– 1 for Cd...|$|E
