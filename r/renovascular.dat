50|$|The {{cause of}} <b>renovascular</b> {{hypertension}} {{is consistent with}} any narrowing/blockage of blood supply to the renal organ (renal artery stenosis). As a consequence of this action the renal organs release hormones that indicate to the body to maintain a higher amount of sodium and water, which in turn causes blood pressure to rise. Factors that may contribute are: diabetes,high cholesterol and advanced age, also of importance is that a unilateralcondition is sufficient to cause <b>renovascular</b> hypertension.|$|E

50|$|Many {{factors and}} causes are {{contributory}} in hypertensive crises. One main cause is the discontinuation of antihypertensive medications.

50|$|Renal artery {{stenosis}} is the {{narrowing of}} one of the renal arteries, most often caused by atherosclerosis or fibromuscular dysplasia. This narrowing of the renal artery can impede blood flow to the target kidney, resulting in <b>renovascular</b> hypertension - a secondary type of high blood pressure. Possible complications of renal artery stenosis are chronic kidney disease and coronary artery disease.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Renovascular</b> {{hypertension}} (or [...] "renal hypertension") is {{a condition}} in which high blood pressure is caused by the kidneys' hormonal response to narrowing of the arteries supplying the kidneys. When functioning properly this hormonal axis regulates blood pressure. Due to low local blood flow, the kidneys mistakenly increases blood pressure of the entire circulatory system. It is a form of secondary hypertension - a form of hypertension whose cause is identifiable.|$|E
50|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of <b>renovascular</b> hypertension {{involves the}} narrowing {{of the arteries}} supplying the kidneys which causes a low perfusion pressure that is detected by the juxtaglomerular apparatus (via the juxtaglomerular cells, which act as baroreceptors; located on the afferent arteriole wall). This leads to renin secretion that causes the angiotensinogen conversion to angiotensin I. Angiotensin I then proceeds to the lung where it is converted to angiotensin II via angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE).|$|E

50|$|Hypertensive {{kidney disease}} is a medical {{condition}} referring to damage to the kidney due to chronic high blood pressure. HN {{can be divided into}} two types: benign and malignant. Benign nephrosclerosis is common in individuals over the age of 60 where malignant nephrosclerosis is uncommon and affects 1-5% of individuals with high blood pressure, that have diastolic blood pressure passing 130 mm Hg.

5000|$|Those {{with the}} disease often notice {{symptoms}} between 15 and 30 years of age.

Due to obstruction of the main branches of the aorta, including the left common carotid artery, the brachiocephalic artery, and the left subclavian artery, Takayasu's arteritis can present as pulseless upper extremities (arms, hands, and wrists with weak or absent pulses on the physical examination) which may be why it is also commonly referred to as the [...] "pulseless disease."

50|$|In humans, {{vascular}} endothelium production of EETs involves mainly CYP2C9 and numerous indirect studies have implicated CYP epoxygenase, possibly CYP2C9, in producing a product which causes vasodilation. These studies find that selective (but not entirely specific) CYP epoxygenase-inhibiting drugs reduce human vasodilation responses elicited by the vasodilators bradykinin, acetylcholine, and methacholine; {{this suggests that}} these vasodilators operate by stimulation the production of EETs. Human studies also find that Caucasian but not African American subjects who have the Lys55Arg single nucleotide polymorphism variant in the polyunsaturated fatty epoxide-inactivating enzyme, sEH, express hyperactive sEH and show reduced vasodilation responses to bradykinin. Other studies find that women with pregnancy-induced hypertension and subjects with <b>Renovascular</b> hypertension exhibit low plasma ETE levels. Finally, 11,12-EET {{has been shown to}} relax the internal mammary artery in women, indicating that at least this EET has direct vasodilating actions in humans. On the other hand, several studies in humans with single nucleotide polymorphism in CYP epxoygenase genes have given negative or confusing results. The most common variant of CYP2J2, rs890293, similarly contradictive or negative results are reported in studies on the rs11572082 (Arg1391Lys) variant of CYP2C8 and the rs1799853 (Arg144Cys) and rs1057910 (Ile359Leu) variants of CYP2C9, all of which code for an epoxygenase with reduced arachidonic acid-metabolizing and EET-forming activities.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In spontaneously {{hypertensive}} rats (SHR), hypertension {{is mediated}} {{in part by}} an enhanced <b>renovascular</b> response to angiotensin (Ang) II. Pertussis toxin normalizes <b>renovascular</b> responses to Ang II and lowers blood pressure in SHR, suggesting a role for altered Gi signaling in the enhanced <b>renovascular</b> response to Ang II in SHR. To further investigate this hypothesis, we measured reductions in renal blood flow and increases in <b>renovascular</b> resistance in response to intrarenal infusions of Ang II in the presence and absence of coactivation of a 2 -adrenoceptors (ie, receptors selectively coupled to Gi) with UK 14, 304 in adrenalectomized, renal-denervated, captopril-pretreated SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. In SHR, but not Wistar-Kyoto rats, UK 14, 304 markedly enhanced <b>renovascular</b> responses to Ang II and vasopressin. However, UK 14, 304 did not enhance <b>renovascular</b> responses to methoxamine (a 1 -adrenoceptor agonist) in either strain. In uninephrectomized, normotensive Sprague-Dawley animals and in Sprague-Dawley rats with nongenetic hypertension induced by uninephrectomy, chronic administration of deoxycor-ticosterone acetate, and 1 % saline as drinking water, UK 14, 304 {{had little or no}} effect on <b>renovascular</b> responses to Ang II. In SHR, intrarenal infusions of U 73122, a phospholipase C/D inhibitor, blocked the enhancement of <b>renovascular</b> responses to Ang II by UK 14, 304. We conclude that activation of a 2 -adrenoceptors selectively enhances <b>renovascular</b> responses to Ang II and vasopressin in vivo in animals with genetic hypertensive but not in normotensive animals or animals with acquired hypertension. These results suggest that in SHR, there is a genetically mediated enhanced cros...|$|E

40|$|Background: Noninvasive {{cost-effective}} {{screening of}} hypertensive patients for <b>renovascular</b> hypertension is a desirable {{approach to a}} rare disorder. Currently many patients are screened with angiography, which is both invasive and expensive. Methods: A MEDLINE search from 1985 through July 1994 using the key words "renovascular hypertension, " "noninvasive,' " "screening " generated 16 references. We reviewed these references, {{as well as several}} additional references, in an effort to find a reliable noninvasive screening test for <b>renovascular</b> hypertension. Results find Conclusions: To date, the most reliable noninvasive screening test for <b>renovascular</b> hypertension is captopril renography. Results of captopril renography allow the physician to diagnose <b>renovascular</b> hypertension with an accuracy of greater than 90 percent. Cost-effectiveness requires appropriate selection of high-risk hypertensive patients for subsequent investigation with captopril renography.
