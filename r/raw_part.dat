Alignment process requires two steps: first, characterization of geometry, and second, alignment. Important skills are necessary, and, besides the time consumption of workforce and machine, the risk of getting into shortage of material is high. The paper presents a novel automated alignment solution based on 3 D vision technology, {{with the aim of}} minimising the total <b>raw</b> <b>part</b> alignment process time. The potential of the solution to reduce the alignment process time in machine tools is demonstrated in milling pilot cases...|$|E

40|$|A {{production}} node {{within a}} network of interconnected production centers (as in supply chains) is considered in this paper, {{with the aim of}} optimizing inventory levels and production effort. The proposed Hybrid Inventory-Production model consists of two inventories (the input one for <b>raw</b> <b>parts</b> and the output one for processed parts) and a production resource which transforms parts and moves them from the input to the output inventory, at a certain rate. The production node interacts with other nodes in the network by the arrival process (<b>raw</b> <b>parts</b> entering the node) and the departure process (processed parts leaving the node). In HIP systems, arrival and departure processes, as well as the production process, are supposed to be piece-wise constant functions that change their values at asynchronous time instants. Based on this model and considering different cost terms, a mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problem has been defined. Then, some assumptions have been considered and the optimization problem has been simplified until obtaining a linear statement...|$|R

That is why realising a proper analyse regarding the possible failures associated to these issues is overwhelming. This paper’s aim is to propose an approach for collection of items necessary for starting a Design FMEA, using Functional Analysis, TRIZ functional modelling and axiomatic design approaches. The proposed approach – to extract items for a FMEA analyse – is applied to {{an example of an}} expanding mandrel regarding its internal components and theirs relations in order to accomplish the main requirement: the accurate locating and clamping of a part...|$|E
40|$|Part with {{sculptured}} surfaces {{is obtained}} in three stages: roughing, semi-finishing and finishing. The roughing operation consists in using flat end tools or fillet end tools on sequential horizontal cutting planes {{to remove the}} most material from the <b>raw</b> <b>part</b> {{as rapidly as possible}} using “Parallel Planes” or “Offset Contours ” machining strategy. When roughing deep parts, radial cutting forces, vibrations and tool bending are important. To avoid these disadvantages, the “Plunge Milling ” strategy is developed. The complex geometry of sculptured surfaces makes the tool path generation without interferences and collisions a very difficult task. In this paper, an automated methodology is proposed for roughing any part with sculptured surfaces from its STL model using “Plunge Milling ” strategy on 3 -axis CNC milling machines. After the specification of the principal parameters (stock allowance, radial cutting depth, radial step, tool diameter and sweeping mode), the methodology determines: 1) intersection contours, 2) machined segments, 3) plunging positions without interferences, 4) plunge depth for each valid plunging position, 5) minimum tool length avoiding collision and finally tool path in « One-Way » or « Zig-Zag » mode...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a knowledge model applied to fixture design is a complex task. The main purpose of such model is the {{development of}} a knowledge-based application to assist fixture designers. It comprises a detailed specification of the types and structures of data involved in the execution of the inference process needed to create a fixture solution for machining a <b>raw</b> <b>part.</b> A development method together with a knowledge model for automating fixture design is proposed. The development was divided into three parts: Design Process Model, definition of Top-level functional functions and Product Knowledge Model. Adopting a functional design approach, the fixture design solution was created in two levels: functional and detailed. The functional level is based on fixture functional elements and the detailed one is based on fixture commercial elements. The definitions and concepts used in the application are specified in several Units of Knowledge (UoK) that comprises the Fixture Knowledge Model. Common Knowledge Analysis and Design Structuring (CommonKADS), Methodology and software tools Oriented to KBE Applications (MOKA), Integrated DEFinition for Function Modelling (IDEF 0) and Unified Modelling Language (UML) are the methodologies and techniques used in the proposed method. Finally, a prototype KBE application for fixture design was developed...|$|E

40|$|Cooking of {{potatoes}} causes {{changes in the}} microstructure and composition of starch. These changes affect the interaction of light with the starch granules at different regions inside the potato. In this research, the potential of hyperspectral imaging in combination with chemometric tools for contactless detection of the cooking front in potatoes has been investigated. Boiled potatoes cooked for 0 to 30 minutes were cut into halves and their cut surfaces were scanned by a hyperspectral camera in the wavelength range 400 – 1000 nm. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) was employed to discriminate between the pixel spectra for the cooked regions and those for the remaining raw regions. From each of the resulting images with detected cooking fronts, the relative area, which is {{the ratio of the}} remaining <b>raw</b> <b>part</b> area over the total potato area, was calculated. Then a heat transfer model was applied to plot the relative area against the cooking time and the optimal cooking time was defined as the time when the relative area became zero. It was found that the optimal cooking time could be precisely predicted by measuring one potato sample without cooking and another cooked for 12 to 21 minutes. The results illustrate the potential of hyperspectral imaging as a process monitoring tool for the potato processing industry. status: publishe...|$|E

In this study, the working environment of potato tubers processing in rural area {{was used for the}} study assessment. However, this kind of job requires high force job load and awkward postures thus contribute to cause Musculoskeletal Disorder (MSDs). This field of study is to assess the risk of manual handling activities by comparing using the observational techniques and Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire (CMDQ) to ol. The CMDQ tool was applied to study the prevalence of WMSDs by through interview session and direct observation using digital camera during the visit. The Rapid Upper Limb assessment (RULA) and The Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) methods used and categorised in this study. The collected data analysed and appropriate recommendation for ergonomic intervention will be proposed to reduce the risk level of the task. To determine the effectiveness of the proposed solution, table of comparison using RULA and REBA with marks evaluation were conducted. With associated to CMDQ tools, the results show that the most body discomfort areas were recorded in the shoulder about 80 %, followed by lower back (75 %), forearm (75 %), wrist (75 %), upper arm (70 %), thigh (45 %), knee (40 %) foot (35 %) and lower leg (20 %). For RULA and REBA score mostly they are rated in ten (10) and (7) score, meaning that the higher the grand score the high recommendation and investigation need to be done to prevent any injury. Chi-square analysis revealed a significant association between the number of person complains pain in the shoulder, lower back, forearm and wrist and the RULAfREBA score grand score Ip < 0. 05).

The decision variables are the constant rate at which <b>raw</b> <b>parts</b> enter the system and the service rate at the various time instants.

40|$|In this paper, the {{proposed}} Hybrid Inventory-Production model represents a manufacturing center with two inventories (the input one for <b>raw</b> <b>parts</b> and the output one for processed parts) and a production resource which moves parts from the input to the output inventory, {{at a certain}} rate. In the considered modelling framework, time-driven and event-driven dynamics coexist, yielding to a hybrid system. An optimization problem is defined where decisions concern the production process (piece-wise constant function changing its value at asynchronous time instants) and the arrival process. Then, an optimal control problem is stated {{in order to find}} the closed-loop solutions as functions of the system state. In particular, a multi-stage optimal control problem is defined and it is solved by applying dynamic programming techniques...|$|R
