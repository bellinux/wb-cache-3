40|$|The <b>raspberry</b> <b>crown</b> <b>borer,</b> Pennisetia marginata (Harris) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae), is a pest of caneberries in {{the genus}} Rubus. Understanding its sexual {{communication}} {{may lead to}} the development of sound- and/or semiochemical-based monitoring and management tools. Newly-eclosed females wing fan. By testing playback of recorded sounds in pheromone-baited traps, I revealed that wing fanning is not involved in long-range sexual communication. Trap and pheromone lure attributes affected capture of males. Most notably, freshly prepared pheromone lures were significantly more attractive than lures aged at room temperature for 2 - 10 days. Mass trapping with high-dose (100 μg) pheromone lures reduced capture of males in traps baited with low-dose (10 μg) pheromone lures by 93 % in 2010 and by 75 % in 2011. Fifty percent male flight in raspberry occurred between 838 and 892 degree days > 10 °C from January 1. A trap-catch threshold of 19 moths captured between 652 and 842 degree days consistently indicated egg-infested canes...|$|E

The published article is copyrighted by the American Society for Horticultural Science and can be found at: [URL] management, training time, and irrigation practices were evaluated from 2013 to 2014 in a mature field of trailing blackberry (Rubus L. subgenus Rubus Watson) established in western Oregon. The field was planted in 2010 and certified organic in 2012, before the first harvest season. Treatments included two cultivars (Marion and Black Diamond), three weed management practices [nonweeded, hand-weeded or bare soil, and weed mat (black landscape fabric) ], two irrigation strategies (irrigation throughout the growing season and no postharvest irrigation), and two primocane training dates (August and February). When averaged over the other treatments, ‘Marion’ and ‘Black Diamond’ had similar yields in both years. However, the presence of weeds reduced vegetative growth and yield, especially in ‘Black Diamond’, while weed mat increased growth and yield over hand-weeded plots by 13 %. Withholding irrigation after harvest reduced water use by an average of 44 % each year without adversely affecting yield in either cultivar. The effects of training time were primarily seen in 2014 after a cold winter. August-trained ‘Marion’ plants had more cold damage than February-trained plants and, consequently, had fewer and shorter canes, less biomass, fewer nodes, and 1 kg/plant less yield than February-trained plants. ‘Black Diamond’ was cold hardier than ‘Marion’, but was more readily infested by <b>raspberry</b> <b>crown</b> <b>borer</b> (Pennisetia marginata Harris). As the planting reached maturity, yields in the best performing organic production systems (both cultivars under weed mat and ‘Marion’ that was February-trained) averaged 11 and 9 t·ha⁻¹, for ‘Black Diamond’ and ‘Marion’ respectively, similar to what would be expected in conventional production...|$|E

40|$|Northern Australian pest {{management}} is a moving feast for the Grain/Pulse industries. Key challenges include changing pest behaviour, the southward movement of some pests, changing agronomic practices, {{and the risk}} of insecticide resistance in new IPM compatible insecticides. Changed pest behaviour includes lucerne seed web moth (Etiella behrii) attacking vegetative soybeans and its increased incidence in podding mungbeans and soybeans. Changing pest distribution is illustrated by soybean stem fly (Melanagromyza sojae), previously a tropical pest in Australia, with major recent outbreaks in the Northern Rivers region of NSW. Confounding the impact assessment of this pest were concurrent outbreaks of plant pathogens such as charcoal rot (Macrophomina phaseolina), which produces sudden death plant symptoms often attributed to stem fly. Changed agronomic practices impacting on {{pest management}} include zero till cultivation and the move to narrow row spacing (< 50 cm) to boost yield. Zero till greatly increases the overwintering survival of lucerne <b>crown</b> <b>borer</b> (Zygrita diva), a stem boring beetle in soybeans that overwinters in soybean stubble, and the black soil scarab (Othnonius batseii), which is becoming a major issue in maize and sorghum crops. Narrow rows have implications for pest sampling, with potentially greater pest count variability. Lastly, the high effectiveness of new group 28 caterpillar insecticides threatens their overuse and the subsequent development of resistance in their key target, the corn earworm Helicoverpa armigera. This paper outlines the latest research that is addressing the above issues, and also identifies research gaps, including areas where international collaboration would benefit...|$|R
