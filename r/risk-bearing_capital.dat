Existing series, based on the archival records of individual companies and on market data, provide results that are relatively reliable, if limited in scope. The national income accounting framework, in conjunction with capital stock measurements, instead offers the potential to identify a comprehensive series, although one subject {{to a number of}} valuation assumptions. In this paper, such a new series is provided and evaluated. business performance, rates of return, UK <b>risk-bearing</b> <b>capital,</b> 1855 - 1914, national income accounting,...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{studies the}} {{connection}} between risk-sharing and organizational form. It models the organizational form decision as a trade-off between the superior capital market access of the stock form and a regulatory or agency advantage held by the mutual form. When capital is expensive, consumers will substitute away from paying investors to supply <b>risk-bearing</b> <b>capital</b> and toward bearing more risk through mutual companies. The theory is supported with evidence from the Pennsylvania fire insurance market in 1874 - 1909. During this period, use of the mutual form moved {{in tandem with the}} insurance underwriting cycle...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} {{the new and}} standardized European system of supervisory called Solvency II. In essence, asymmetric distribution of information between policyholder and insurer triggered this new regulation which aims at better protecting policyholders. Its three-pillar model is about to challenge both, insurers as well as policyholders. The first pillar includes quantitative aspects, the second pillar contains qualitative aspects and the third pillar comprises market transparency and reporting obligations. Underwriting risks, the default risk of a bank and market risks can be identified for the dynamic hybrid. Solvency II covers all these risks in the first pillar and insurers shall deposit sufficient <b>risk-bearing</b> <b>capital.</b> In our analysis, we first identify the dynamic hybrid specific risks under the Solvency II regime und then develop product modifications to reduce this risk...|$|E

The book debuted at #8 on the New York Times top ten non-fiction {{list and}} reached #1 on the New York Times business book list. The Upside of Inequality {{was met with}} positive reviews, including former president of Harvard University and economist Larry Summers, a very tough critic {{on the other side}} of the aisle, blurbed: I disagree but respect the argument, calling it [...] "a very valuable contribution" [...] that will [...] "sharpen your thinking on critical economic issues." [...] Noted economist Tyler Cowen who wrote on Bloomberg News: [...] "Conard’s central idea is that <b>risk-bearing</b> equity <b>capital</b> is the truly scarce asset in most economic situations, and economic analysis should adapt accordingly. He is very creative in seeing some of the implications of this view. I[...] [...]found it very stimulating to ponder. It puts many of the pieces together in a new and different way." [...] Harvard economist Greg Mankiw recommended Upside and interviewed Conard on CSPAN. David Author, George Borjas, Larry Lindsey, and other prominent economists also praised it.

40|$|Venture {{capital is}} equity finance (the {{business}} <b>risk-bearing</b> class of <b>capital)</b> provided to unquoted businesses. Such investee firms can be started up, expanded, rescued, purchased as unquoted businesses, or become unquoted {{as a consequence}} of purchase using venture capital. Moreover, it can enable additional bank finance to be raised, usually of the traditional type (term, loans and overdrafts), which bears the credit risk but can form part of the purchase price. Equity is often said to be a relatively cheap source of funds in the early or critical stages of business because dividends can be delayed or subdued until some future date. In the context of venture capital, this is usually related to achieving particular target levels of profit. The point at which the venture capital investor realises all or part of their claim is known as "exit". This can take several forms, including flotation on a stock market, selling to another company or "trade buyer", or selling to another venture capital investor...|$|R
40|$|Labour managed firms {{face some}} serious {{problems}} {{with regard to the}} provision of capital, especially of <b>risk-bearing</b> <b>capital.</b> These difficulties are discussed {{in the first part of}} the paper. Subsequently it is argued that these problems are rooted in the fact that the workers are insufficiently committed to the long run well-being of the labour managed firm, i. e. in the lacking of a sufficient commitment mechanism. An interchange of the roles which capital and labour play under capitalism would require tradable job rights, an arrangement which is not feasible. It is concluded therefrom that any workable labour managed economy needs a special commitment mechanism. A high rate of unemployment might serve for this purpose, or, more attractively, a reduction of labour mobility through appropriate incentives like seniority-dependent remuneration schemes. ...|$|E
40|$|Problems {{of farmers}} and {{co-ordination}} of (agricultural related) activities {{can not be}} solved simply by EU and/or government support; instead, private-market co-ordination institutions, like emerging producers ’ groups and co-operatives seems to be vital in establishing bargaining power. In theory and according to Western European (Dutch, Danish etc.) and US practical experiences, one of the main important private institutions which can strength producers and help to co-ordinate (agricultural) chains is the co-operative form. In {{order to be able to}} fulfil the basic co-operative aims and to be able to compete in a more market-oriented environment (e. g. more liberal agricultural policies, opening European and world market, etc.) they will execute new marketing strategies. To be able to implement such new marketing strategies, co-ops have to collect more <b>risk-bearing</b> <b>capital</b> and this is currently precipitating some fundamental financial and organisational changes in Western European agricultural co-ops. To be able to keep the basic co-operative character, they are undertaking internal and external organisational changes, which in a number of cases will create so called new co-operative structures/models. In this paper, the concept of the “co-operative identity " (consisting from the definition, aim...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{traditional}} {{theory of the}} firm gave little attention to institutional detail, the common assumption about the units that engage in the production and sale {{of goods and services}} was that they are owned and controlled by individuals who provide <b>risk-bearing</b> <b>capital</b> and who hire the services of workers as one among several variable inputs. Worker-run cooperatives had existed in small numbers at least since the industrial revolution, but the study of such firms using formal analytical tools awaited the added stimuli provided by the challenge of understanding collective farm performance in the Soviet Union and China and Yugoslavia 2 ̆ 019 s experiment with worker-managed market socialism. The models developed in the late 1950 s and thereafter were subsequently applied not only to those cases but also to understanding worker-owned firms in industrial market economies, to investigating hypothetical economies consisting exclusively of worker-run firms, and to attempting to explain why worker control is relatively rare. As studies on the topic multiplied, the term 2 ̆ 01 clabor-managed firm 2 ̆ 01 d came to be used by economists to describe an enterprise that operates under the ultimate control of those who work in it...|$|E
40|$|Principal-agent {{analysis}} {{is applied to}} contemporary evidence on venture capital investment. The investor (as principal) and investee (as agent) are analysed in terms of risk management, information handling and the trading of risk and information. Investors and investees were paired in 'dyads', with each party being subject to separate face-to-face interviews. The paper develops the appropriate principal-agent models for dealing with incentives for entrepreneurial effort and issues of information and monitoring. The way in which investees and investors seek contract optimality is then examined, using qualitative data. It is shown that the evidence provides striking confirmation of {{the applicability of the}} principal-agent model to the venture capital financing of mature small firms. The most crucial feature of contract optimality was perceived to be the propoer choice of capital structure. This established ownership entitlement, created incentives for effort, and apportioned risk eficiently. Many investor-investee relations were perceived to be at or close to contract optimality. These optima were specific to time and place situations and strongly reflected individual house-styles of investors. Investor reputations were strongly attached to house styles. principal-agent model, entrepreneurship, mature small firms, venture <b>capital,</b> <b>risk-bearing,</b> information handling, contract optimality...|$|R
40|$|While Pillar 1 of the {{regulatory}} capital framework Basel II stipulates capital requirements for credit, market and operational risk, Pillar 2 focuses on the economic and internal perspective of banks’ capital adequacy. To ensure capital adequacy, banks are required to have an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) in place {{that enables them to}} identify, measure and aggregate all material risk types and calculate the economic, or internal, capital necessary to cover these risks. In addition to this, banks should actively manage their overall risk profile. The ICAAP is essential to the preservation of financial stability and will be subject to a higher degree of supervisory scrutiny in the near future. Under the principle of proportionality, requirements for the ICAAP are in line with banks’ specific characteristics and business models. As a result, a variety of approaches is in use. This paper provides a summary of the information Austria’s eight largest banks (in terms of systemic importance) have to date published on this subject (e. g. annual reports and specific documents in line with disclosure requirements). <b>capital</b> adequacy, <b>risk-bearing</b> capacity, economic <b>capital,</b> Basel II, Pillar 2, ICAAP, large Austrian banks, risk management...|$|R
40|$|Private pension {{provision}} {{faces the}} challenging task of providing stable income streams during retirement. The challenge has increased markedly {{in the last}} decades due to volatile financial markets, falling interest rates and the withdrawal of employers and external insurers as risk bearers of systematic financial and longevity risks. Partly because of these developments, policyholders desire pensions tailored to their individual needs. This paper proposes {{a new type of}} pension: the Personal Pension with Risk sharing (PPR). By unbundling and valuing the investment, (dis) saving, insurance and risk‐sharing functions of pensions, PPRs allow risk management and (dis) saving to be customized to the specific features of heterogeneous individuals. Moreover, unlike variable annuities, PPRs allow investment risks to be combined with longevity insurance without giving rise to high year‐on‐year volatility in consumption streams or opaque and rigid valuation and smoothing rules. The unbundling of functions in the PPR also deepens the internal markets for financial and insurance products {{while at the same time}} accommodating the diverse traditions of countries in terms of occupational pension provision. Finally, the PPR reconciles financial, fiscal and macroeconomic stability with growth by increasing the supply of long‐term <b>risk‐bearing</b> and illiquid <b>capital,</b> complementing public retirement provision, reducing the interest‐rate sensitivity of pensions and smoothing shocks...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{perspective}} on the Swiss Solvency Test (SST) for a life insurance contract under the assumption that the insurance company is risk neutral with respect to mortality, that is mortality risk is assumed to be diversifiable. In fact, if the portfolio of an insurance company is not too small, the law of large numbers for mortality risks can be applied and mortality dependent random cash flows can be replaced by their expected cash flows with respect to some life table. In this setting, the driver of the SST is the random assets of the insurance portfolio, which depend on the realized future investment returns on the capital market. The corresponding SST target capital can be viewed as an approximate value of the market risk of a life insurance contract. We show how to determine the SST risk measure and a modified SST coherent risk measure for a life insurance contract. We illustrate with a numerical example for a typical endowment contract. We observe that in all of our examples, which depend on the choice of the expected rate of return and the volatility of return, the expected shortfall of the first year <b>risk-bearing</b> <b>capital</b> is negative. If we assume that at the entry date of the endowment contract there is no liability and set the SST target capital equal to its initial capital, then the defined implicit equation has a unique initial capital as solution. Moreover, the obtained unique solutions correspond either to a vanishing SST risk measure or to a vanishing SST coherent risk measure. A unique solution is eithe...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines some of {{the implications}} of the separation of organizational ownership and control. The first essay extends the CEO compensation literature in two areas. First, it tests multiple determinants of CEO pay, including financial performance, CEO <b>risk-bearing,</b> CEO human <b>capital,</b> and board structure. Second, it examines the pay of hospital CEOs, which permits a test of the importance of an organization 2 ̆ 7 s status as being either investor-owned or nonprofit. The empirical findings suggest that each of the multiple determinants of CEO pay is important, and that there are few differences in the predictors of CEO pay between for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals. ^ The second essay examines the factors associated with director compensation at large, publicly traded U. S. firms. Three approaches, based on different assumptions {{about the nature of the}} board, are tested. First, directors can be paid to act in shareholder interests, suggesting that pay is related to corporate performance and the need for board monitoring. A second approach suggests that directors are pawns of managers and that board pay is related to managerial cooptation. A third method is to pay directors solely for the time they spend attending to board matters. The empirical results support to differing extents, all three approaches. ^ The third essay examines the reactions of corporate managers to the proxy statement disclosure rule requiring a five year performance graph. Managers could choose to include an additional graph presenting a more favorable impression of the company 2 ̆ 7 s performance. Following prior governance research, I hypothesize that an additional graph is more likely if the company underperformed its peers, paid its CEO a higher salary, and lacked a large shareholder. These hypotheses are tested on a sample of large firms. The results show that impression management is important to managers. ...|$|R
