In 2015, Emory University was one of four institutions selected by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for its seven-year, multimillion-dollar Tuberculosis Research Units (TBRU) program, which aims to drive innovation in tuberculosis research and reduce the global burden of the disease. In 2015, an Emory-led research consortium received a five-year, 15 million dollar grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to research human immune responses to Varicella zoster virus and pneumococcal vaccination. The university also received a $9 million grant over five years from the NIH to support one of three national Centers for Collaborative Research in Fragile X syndrome. The grant is a renewal of Emory’s National Fragile X Research Center, continuously funded by the NIH for more than 10 years. In 2015, the university received a $8.9 million grant over five years from the NIH National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute(NHLBI) to better understand the role of reactive oxygen species and inflammation in blood vessel function and to explore new interventions and preventive approaches for atherosclerosis and aortic aneurysms. In 2015, the university received a $8 million grant over five years from the NIH to develop and validate mathematical models of how prior immunity affects recall immune responses to influenza viruses.

25|$|Plants acquire CO2 {{and produce}} organic {{compounds}} {{with the use}} of one of three photosynthetic pathways. The two most prevalent pathways are the C3 and C4 processes. C3 plants are best adapted to cool and wet conditions while C4 plants do well in hot and dry ecosystems. Due to the different photosynthetic enzymes between the two pathways, different carbon isotopes are acquired preferentially. Isotopes are the same element that differ in the number of neutrons, thereby making one isotope heavier than the other. The two stable carbon isotopes are 12C and 13C. The C3 pathway will discriminate against the heavier isotope more than the C4 pathway. This will make the plant structures produced from C4 plants more enriched in the heavier isotope and therefore root exudates and litter from these plants will also be more enriched. When the carbon in these structures is respired, the CO2 will show a similar ratio of the two isotopes. <b>Researchers</b> <b>will</b> grow a C4 plant on soil that was previously occupied by a C3 plant or vice versa. By taking soil respiration measurements and analyzing the isotopic ratios of the CO2 it can be determined whether the soil respiration is mostly old versus recently formed carbon. For example, maize, a C4 plant, was grown on soil where spring wheat, a C3 plant, was previously grown. The results showed respiration of C3 SOM in the first 40 days, with a gradual linear increase in heavy isotope enrichment until day 70. The days after 70 showed a slowing enrichment to a peak at day 100. By analyzing stable carbon isotope data it is possible to determine the source components of respired SOM that was produced by different photosynthetic pathways.|$|E

Through the literature survey the researcher hopes to derive a clearer meaning of the term reflective teaching. The central concept which <b>will</b> guide the <b>researcher</b> in his literature survey will be reflective teaching. At this stage in the research project the central concept would be defined as the ability of the teacher to critically analyze his own work which brings about a process of self awareness, self critique, social and institutional critique. Reflective teaching could be viewed from three dimensions. THE TECHNICAL DIMENSION: The efficiency and effectiveness of the means to attain ends. THE PRACTICAL DIMENSION: This is the teaching activity accessing the adequacy of educational goals. CRITICAL DIMENSION: Questioning which educational goals, {{why are you doing this}} ? What do we hope to achieve ? It should be understood that this definition is not rigid and set, but rather it is tentative and evolving throughout the study, which will be based on information gathered in our literature review.
