5|$|After {{leaving the}} golf course behind, PA106 makes a gradual turn to the {{southeast}} at Crystal Lake Road. There, the highway becomes known as Fall Brook Road, and turns southward through forestry. At the intersection with43rd Street, PA106 enters the city of Carbondale. The route, known now as Fallbrook Street, continues on a southeastern trend, entering a large <b>residential</b> <b>district</b> north of the business district. At the intersection with Dundaff Street, it turns southward again, paralleling a nearby river. At the intersection with River Street, PA106 turns eastward along Salem Avenue, crosses the river and intersects with US 6 Bus. (North Main Street) in Carbondale.

5|$|Until the mid 19th century, {{the city}} {{remained}} largely concentrated around the Rova of Antananarivo {{on the highest}} peak, an area today referred to as la haute ville or la haute ("upper town"). As the population grew, the city expanded to the west; by the late 19th century it extended to the northern hilltop neighborhood of Andohalo, an area of low prestige until British missionaries made it their preferred <b>residential</b> <b>district</b> and built one of the city's memorial churches here from 1863 to 1872. From 1864 to 1894, Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony governed Madagascar alongside three successive queens, Rasoherina, Ranavalona II and Ranavalona III, effecting policies that further transformed the city. In 1881, he reinstated mandatory universal education first introduced in 1820 under Radama I, requiring the construction of numerous schools and colleges, including teacher training colleges staffed by missionaries and the nation's first pharmacy (1862), medical college and modern hospital (1865). Rainilaiarivony built the Andafiavaratra Palace in 1873 as his residence and office at a site near the royal palace.|$|E

25|$|Route 122 {{continues}} eastward along South Main Street, entering Pohatcong Township where state maintenance begins. At first, {{the road}} passes residential homes; continuing eastward, the highway enters a large <b>residential</b> <b>district,</b> with homes surrounding the highway for several blocks. At the intersection with County Route 519 (Saint James Avenue), the two routes head along a wrong-way concurrency, running along New Brunswick Avenue, passing the <b>residential</b> <b>district</b> and several schools.

25|$|To {{the east}} is the {{commercial}} and <b>residential</b> <b>district</b> of Merchant City. The Merchant City was formerly the <b>residential</b> <b>district</b> of the wealthy city merchants in the 18th and early 19th centuries, particularly the Tobacco Lords from whom many of the streets take their name. As the Industrial Revolution and the wealth it brought to the city resulted in the expansion of Glasgow's central area westward, the original medieval centre was left behind. Glasgow Cross, situated at the junction of High Street, Gallowgate, Trongate and Saltmarket was the original centre of the city, symbolised by its Mercat cross. Glasgow Cross encompasses the Tolbooth Clock Tower; {{all that remains of}} the original City Chambers, which was destroyed by fire in 1926. Moving northward up High Street towards Rottenrow and Townhead lies the 15th century Glasgow Cathedral and the Provand's Lordship. Due to growing industrial pollution levels in the mid-to-late 19th century, the area fell out of favour with residents.|$|E
