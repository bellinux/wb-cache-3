25|$|As {{a direct}} {{consequence}} of the key recommendations of the Murray report, the federal government established the Australian Universities Commission (AUC) in 1959, appointing Sir Leslie Martin as its chair. Menzies appointed Martin to chair a special committee in 1961 to report to the AUC on the rapidly increasing demands for higher education in Australia. In August 1963 it released its second report, which recognised the urgency of Victoria's situation '…the resources of Melbourne and Monash Universities are not likely to meet the long-term demands for university education beyond 1966. The Commission therefore is willing to support in the 1964–1966 triennium the extension of university facilities in the Melbourne metropolitan area.' Following the recommendations the federal government passed the Universities Assistance Bill in October 1963, providing a grant for a 'third' university for <b>recurrent</b> <b>expenditure</b> in 1965 of $106,000 and $210,000 in 1966.

The interesting, perhaps surprising, findings are: (1) a permanent increase in the matching grants for investment and <b>recurrent</b> <b>expenditures</b> may accelerate or slow down public investment and (2) a current, temporary grant increase stimulates current public investment, but a temporary, future increase in the nonmatching grant reduces current investment and raises current <b>recurrent</b> <b>expenditures.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between capital expenditures and gross fixed capital formation in Nigeria. The study made use of secondary data covering the period 1981 to 2011. A least square regression analysis was carried out on a time series data, and to avert the emergence of spurious results, unit root tests were conducted. Other econometric tools of co- integration, Vector Auto Regression technique as well as Granger causality tests were deployed to ascertain the order of co integration {{and the level of}} relationships existing between the dependent and independent variables. Findings of study reveal that while Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) maintained a negative significant relationship with Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in Nigeria at both 1 % and 5 % Alpha levels; Imports and National Savings had a positive significant relationship with GFCF at both the short and long runs. It was equally observed that the lagged value of GFCF had no significant impact on GFCF in the preceding year. Outcome of study did not come as a surprise, seeing that a functional classification of Nigeria’s expenditure profile for the period under review reveals that; outlays on capital expenditure accounted for only about 32 % of total expenditures, while the remaining balance of 68 % went to <b>recurrent</b> <b>expenditures.</b> That is certainly not good enough for a nation that is aspiring to grow.

50|$|The Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme (VHIS) {{is one of}} {{the major}} medical {{healthcare}} reforms proposed by the government. In Hong Kong, the public and private sectors complement each other under a well-established dual-track healthcare system. However, there is an increasing imbalance between the two sectors. Public hospitals take up more than 88% of in-patient services with heavy government subsidies. Due to aging population, the rising demand of citizens on good quality healthcare service provision and escalating medical costs, the <b>recurrent</b> <b>expenditure</b> of the government on medical and health care services increased continuously, from $32 billion in 2007 to $52 billion in 2014. With such huge demand on public medical services, the quality of healthcare provided would inevitably be affected by the heavy workload of the medical staff and proportionally less medical resources per person. Thus, the government proposed the VHIS to recalibrate the balance between public and private healthcare systems by encouraging more well-off citizens, especially the middle-class, to use the private healthcare services as an alternative. Thus, the public sector can focus on providing services in its target areas, thereby enhancing the long-term sustainability of the dual-track healthcare system.|$|E
