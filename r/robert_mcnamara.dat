5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Soviets were {{designing}} and constructing increasingly sophisticated anti-ballistic missile defense systems to protect strategically important facilities around Moscow, reducing {{the threat posed}} by American ICBMs. These developments compelled the U.S. Secretary of Defense, <b>Robert</b> <b>McNamara,</b> to commission a study to look into ways of improving the survivability of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the National Security Council (NSC) {{meeting on}} September 6, it was agreed that the {{priority}} was to obtain more information on the situation in Vietnam. US Secretary of Defense <b>Robert</b> <b>McNamara</b> proposed sending Marine Corps Major General Victor Krulak on an immediate fact-finding trip. The NSC agreed that Joseph Mendenhall—a Foreign Service Officer with Vietnam experience—would accompany him and the pair began the mission later that day.|$|E

This was the subject of considerable debate between the Navy and the Air Force at the time. Tests were carried out at Sandia Base with the OV-1 Mohawk, A-1 Skyraider, A-4 Skyhawk, A-6 Intruder, F-4 Phantom, F-105 Thunderchief, B-52 and B-58 Hustler aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Later in 1962, United States Secretary of Defense <b>Robert</b> <b>McNamara</b> visited South Vietnam and {{was taken}} on an {{inspection}} tour of the country, accompanied by Diệm and Thảo. Perhaps because Thảo divulged the tour details to Vietcong guerrillas, each of McNamara's stopovers was punctuated by bloody attacks on nearby ARVN installations. For example, when McNamara was in Bình Dương Province, five government soldiers were killed. As he flew from Đà Lạt north to Đà Nẵng near the Demilitarized Zone, he was greeted by a Vietcong bombing of a southbound troop train, which killed 27 and wounded 30 Civil Guard members.|$|E
5|$|She {{pointed out}} that when the {{discussion}} was reported to Washington, the leading US generals in the U.S. military lobbied Defense Secretary <b>Robert</b> <b>McNamara,</b> claiming {{that it was no}} longer feasible to work within the parameters laid out by Saigon and that the U.S. should simply take control of anti-communist military policy, thereby necessitating a coup. The Americans became increasingly concerned with Saigon's reluctance to intensify the war effort, and bombing rebuff was regarded as a critical point. The government's plans to win over the NLF were never implemented to any degree before the government was deposed.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} whether {{to proceed with}} Zeus eventually fell to President John F. Kennedy, who became fascinated by the indecision surrounding the ABM system. In 1963, the United States Secretary of Defense, <b>Robert</b> <b>McNamara,</b> convinced Kennedy to cancel Zeus. McNamara directed its funding towards studies of new ABM concepts being considered by ARPA, selecting the Nike-X concept which addressed Zeus' various problems by using an extremely high-speed missile, Sprint, along with greatly improved radars and computer systems. The Zeus test site built at Kwajalein was briefly used as an anti-satellite weapon.|$|E

5|$|Although Cooper {{voted in}} favor of the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, he opposed {{escalating}} U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. As early as April 1964, Cooper was urging President Johnson to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the tensions in Southeast Asia. He questioned Southeast Asia's strategic importance to the U.S. and expressed concerns about the feasibility of deploying the U.S. military on a global scale. On March 25, 1965, he joined New York Senator Jacob Javits in a call for President Johnson to begin negotiations for a settlement between North Vietnam and South Vietnam without imposing preconditions on the negotiations. Later in the day, he introduced resolutions calling for Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense <b>Robert</b> <b>McNamara</b> to brief the full Senate on recent developments in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Building a {{complete}} deployment {{would have been}} extremely expensive, {{on the order of}} the total yearly budget of the Department of Defense. <b>Robert</b> <b>McNamara,</b> the Secretary of Defense, felt the cost could not be justified and worried it would lead to a further nuclear arms race. He directed the teams to consider deployments where a limited number of interceptors might still be militarily useful. Among these, the I-67 concept suggested building a lightweight defense against very limited attacks. When the People's Republic of China exploded their first H-bomb in 1967, I-67 was promoted as a defense against a Chinese attack, and this system became Sentinel in October. Nike-X development, in its original form, ended.|$|E
5|$|In late 1962, {{after the}} Cuban Missile Crisis had settled {{well enough to}} permit the {{evacuated}} servicemen's families to return to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, Secretary of Defense <b>Robert</b> <b>McNamara</b> was eager to do more for morale there. He asked Perry Como to bring his television show to the Naval base. Perry and his cast and crew were at Guantanamo when the loved ones began their return. The first entertainers to visit the base since the crisis, the Como show filmed there for eight days. Some highlights of the program, which {{was seen in the}} US on December 12, 1962, included Como's shaving a serviceman with a Castro-like beard and the enthusiastic participation when Perry asked for volunteers to come on stage to do the Twist with the lovely ladies who were part of the visiting dance troupe.|$|E

5|$|STRAT-X, or Strategic-Experimental, was a U.S. government-sponsored study {{conducted}} during 1966 and 1967 that comprehensively analyzed the potential {{future of the}} U.S. nuclear deterrent force. At the time, the Soviet Union was making significant strides in nuclear weapons delivery, and also constructing anti-ballistic missile defenses to protect strategic facilities. To address a potential technological {{gap between the two}} superpowers, U.S. Secretary of Defense <b>Robert</b> <b>McNamara</b> entrusted the classified STRAT-X study to the Institute for Defense Analyses, which compiled a twenty-volume report in nine months. The report looked into more than one hundred different weapons systems, ultimately resulting in the MGM-134 Midgetman and LGM-118 Peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missiles, the s, and the Trident submarine-launched ballistic missiles, among others. Journalists have regarded STRAT-X as a major influence on the course of U.S. nuclear policy.|$|E
5|$|While {{the other}} Visegrád members {{were invited to}} join NATO at its 1997 Madrid summit, Slovakia was {{excluded}} based on what several members considered undemocratic actions by nationalist Prime Minister Vladimír Mečiar. Romania and Slovenia were both considered for invitation in 1997, and each had the backing of a prominent NATO member, France and Italy respectively, but support for enlargement was not unanimous, particularly in the US Congress. In {{an open letter to}} US President Bill Clinton, more than forty foreign policy experts including Bill Bradley, Sam Nunn, Gary Hart, Paul Nitze, and <b>Robert</b> <b>McNamara</b> expressed their concerns about NATO expansion as both expensive and unnecessary given the lack of an external threat from Russia at that time.|$|E
5|$|Writing {{after the}} war, <b>Robert</b> <b>McNamara</b> stated that by spring 1967 {{he and other}} civilians in the {{administration}} had become convinced that both Rolling Thunder and the ground war in South Vietnam were not working. McNamara claimed that he and others within the administration continuously opposed the Joint Chief's recommendations for an increased tempo of bombing and the loosening of target restrictions. The generals found themselves on the horns of a dilemma of their own making. They continuously claimed that the campaign was working, yet they also had to continuously demand greater latitude {{in order to make}} the campaign succeed. The limited goals entailed in American foreign policy and the military's goal of total victory were simply not reconcilable. The great conundrum had then become how to defeat North Vietnam without defeating North Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|It {{was planned}} to launch four {{satellites}} in December 1962. However, before the launches could take place, then Secretary of Defense <b>Robert</b> <b>McNamara</b> cancelled the program, due to concerns {{that it would}} not be able to operate if a full scale nuclear war broke out, and that only a small number of SAINTs could be launched at a time. The project had also gone over budget, spending over 100 million dollars, which was several times the funding that had been publicly reported. By the end of the 1960s, the concept of inspecting Soviet satellites was abandoned as the Soviets had begun installing destruction packages on their satellites, that would blow up both itself and the SAINT, by use of the APO-2 destruction system, which could either be set off by its operators in the USSR, or if it sensed that it was being scanned. The standard American military reconnaissance satellite was capable of scanning other satellites long range, along with ground based detection of satellites.|$|E
5|$|On October 5, 1963, the CIP {{was briefly}} {{suspended}} by the United States {{in the wake}} of the McNamara Taylor mission, a fact-finding expedition to South Vietnam conducted by Secretary of Defense <b>Robert</b> <b>McNamara</b> and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Maxwell D. Taylor to investigate the progress of the fight against the communist Vietcong insurgency. The report concluded that Diem was not concentrating on fighting the insurrection but was instead preoccupied with quelling Buddhist protests for religious equality, such as raiding pagodas and firing on Buddhist dissidents. One of the reasons for the CIP suspension was to give military officers a signal that Washington was unhappy with Diem and therefore increase the prospects of a coup, as well as to try and foster urban resentment towards Diem among those that had previously benefited from the CIP. Another was that Diem might change his policy direction in accordance with US wishes, although they considered this to be unlikely. Funding was restored in early November 1963, about a month later, after the deposal and assassination of Diem in a military coup.|$|E
5|$|To {{fulfill the}} Air Force {{requirement}} for all-weather attack, Republic proposed the F-105D variant in 1957. This version featured an enlarged nose and radome housing the AN/ASG-19 Thunderstick bombing/navigation system. The AN/ASG-19 was designed around the Autonetics R-14A radar, which operated in both air-to-air and air-to-ground modes, and the AN/APN-131 Doppler navigation radar. In the cockpit, the F-105D featured vertical-tape instrument displays for adverse weather operation. The {{ability to carry}} the TX-43 nuclear weapon was also added. The RF-105 reconnaissance development was also restarted, now based on the F-105D. The first D-model took its maiden flight on 9 June 1959. Plans to build over 1,500 F-105Ds were cut short when Secretary of Defense <b>Robert</b> <b>McNamara</b> decided to equip no more than seven combat wings with the type. In November 1961, production was cut {{in favor of the}} Air Force adopting the Navy's F-4 Phantom II, and in the longer term, the General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark of the TFX program.|$|E

5|$|The {{arguments}} {{that led to}} the cancellation of the B-70 program had led some to question the need for a new strategic bomber of any sort. The USAF was adamant about retaining bombers as part of the nuclear triad concept that included bombers, ICBMs, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) in a combined package that complicated any potential defense. They argued that the bomber was needed to attack hardened military targets and to provide a safe counterforce option because the bombers could be quickly launched into safe loitering areas where they could not be attacked. However, the introduction of the SLBM made moot the mobility and survivability argument, and a newer generation of ICBMs, such as the Minuteman III, had the accuracy and speed needed to attack point targets. During this time, ICBMs were seen as a less costly option based on their lower unit cost, but development costs were much higher. Secretary of Defense <b>Robert</b> <b>McNamara</b> preferred ICBMs over bombers for the Air Force portion of the deterrent force and felt a new expensive bomber was not needed. McNamara limited the AMSA program to studies and component development beginning in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{original}} agreement, the USAF paid {{the cost of}} maintenance for the missiles for five years. After this costs would fall on the United Kingdom, which {{would have to take}} over their logistic support. With ICBMs becoming available, the Americans did not foresee the Thor missiles making a substantial contribution to the western nuclear deterrent after 1965. On 1 May 1962, the United States Secretary of Defense, <b>Robert</b> <b>McNamara,</b> informed the Minister of Defence, Harold Watkinson, that the United States would not provide support for Thor after 31 October 1964. Watkinson then informed him that the system would be phased out. An Air Council meeting on 31 May 1962 decided that Project Emily should be terminated by the end of 1963. A public announcement was made on 1 August 1962. McNamara's decision on 7 November 1962 to cancel Skybolt—approved by President John F. Kennedy on 23 November—left the RAF without a successor to Thor. The British government negotiated the Nassau Agreement to buy Polaris. The future of the British nuclear deterrent now lay with the Royal Navy. The last Thor squadrons were inactivated on 23 August 1963.|$|E
