5000|$|The {{earliest}} experimental autopilot-controlled landings {{in commercial}} service {{were not in}} fact full auto landings but were termed [...] "auto-flare". In this mode the pilot controlled the roll and yaw axes manually while the autopilot controlled the [...] "flare" [...] or pitch. These were often done in passenger service {{as part of the}} development program. The Trident's autopilot had separate engagement switches for the pitch and roll components, and although the normal autopilot disengagement was by means of a conventional control yoke thumb-button, it was also possible to disengage the <b>roll</b> <b>channel</b> while leaving the pitch channel engaged. In these operations the pilot had acquired full visual reference, normally well above decision height, but instead of fully disengaging the autopilot with the thumb-button, called for the second officer to latch off the <b>roll</b> <b>channel</b> only. He then controlled the lateral flight path manually while monitoring the autopilot's continued control of the vertical flight path - ready to completely disengage it {{at the first sign of}} any deviation. While this sounds as if it may add a risk element in practice it is of course no different in principle to a training pilot monitoring a trainee's handling during on-line training or qualification.|$|E
50|$|Having proven the {{reliability}} and accuracy of the autopilot's ability to flare the aircraft safely, the next elements were to add in similar control of the thrust. This was similarly done by a radio altimeter signal which simply drove the autothrottle servos to a flight idle setting. As the accuracy and reliability of the ground based ILS localiser was increased on a step by step basis, it was permissible to leave the <b>roll</b> <b>channel</b> engaged longer and longer, until in fact the aircraft had ceased to be airborne, and a fully automatic landing had in fact been completed. The first such landing in a BEA Trident was achieved at RAE Bedford (by then home of BLEU) in March 1964. The first on a commercial flight with passengers aboard was achieved on flight BE 343 on 10 June 1965, with a Trident 1 G-ARPR, from Paris to Heathrow with Captains Eric Poole and Frank Ormonroyd.|$|E

The final {{objective of this}} project {{is to develop a}} design method. This paper concentrates on the validation of the FEM model against the experiments. For channel sections loaded through the shear centre (centric loading) sudden collapse was observed while channel sections loaded in the plane of the web (eccentric loading) fail gradually in bending and torsion. The objective of the numerical research was to simulate this experimental behaviour and to predict the failure load correctly. Therefore, a FEM model was made consisting of shell elements and beam elements to compensate for the root radius of the channels, including plastic material behaviour, geometric non-linearity and measured imperfections. The simulations gave agreeable failure loads. For eccentric loading, the FEM simulations showed load-displacement curves, which compare well with experimental results. For centric loading however, the results appeared to be largely sensitive to imperfections with respect to member straightness. Finally, it is concluded that the FEM model is successfully validated against the available test results. ...|$|R

40|$|The area of {{autonomous}} underwater vehicles (AUVs) is {{an increasingly important}} area of research, with AUVs being capable of handling a far wider range of missions than either an inhabited underwater vehicle or a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). One of the major drawbacks of such vehicles is the inability of their control systems to handle faults occurring within the vehicle during a mission. This study aims to develop enhancements to an existing control system {{in order to increase}} its fault tolerance to both sensor and actuator faults. Faults occurring within the sensors for both the yaw and <b>roll</b> <b>channels</b> of the AUV are considered. Novel fuzzy inference systems (FISs) are developed and tuned using both the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and simulated annealing tuning methods. These FISs allow the AUV to continue operating after a fault has occurred within the sensors. Faults occurring within the actuators which control the canards of the AUV and hence the yaw channel are also examined. Actuator recovery FISs capable of handling faults occurring within the actuators are developed using both the simulated annealing and tabu search methods of tuning FISs. The fault tolerance of the AUV is then further enhanced by the development of an error estimation FIS that is used to replace an error sensor. It concludes that the novel FISs designed and developed within the thesis provide an improved performance to both sensor and actuator faults in comparison to benchmark control systems. Therefore having these FISs embedded within the overall control scheme ensure the AUV is fault tolerant to a range of selected failures...|$|R

Part 1 of this two-part series of papers presents {{the estimation of}} the self-manufacturing (direct production) costs for composite and steel structures. The self-manufacturing costs are proposed to {{be defined as the}} sum of the material, the power consumption and the labour costs. The material costs of the structural steel, concrete, reinforcement, the shear connectors, electrodes, the anti-corrosion, fire protection and top coat painting, the formwork floor-slab panels and gas consumption are presented in detail. The power consumption costs comprise costs of sawing the steel sections, edge grinding, drilling, welding, stud welding and vibrating the concrete. The labour costs (times) presented define the costs of metal cutting, edge grinding, preparation, assembling and tacking, welding, welding of shear connectors, steel surface preparation and protection, drilling, cutting, placing and connecting the reinforcement, concreting, consolidating and curing the concrete. New approximation functions are proposed for the calculation of some manufacturing times and material consumptions. As the discussed costs vary significantly around the world, the proposed cost expressions are given in the open form to be used for cost estimation in different economic conditions. A numerical example of the estimation of the self-manufacturing costs for a composite I beam floor system shows the suitability of the proposed approach.

The new sections have improved strength to weight ratio by increasing the section's strength {{through the use of}} stiffeners in the section webs. The European standard, Eurocode 3 [1], uses the traditional Effective Width Method to determine the strength of a cold formed steel member. However, the design of the new sections UltraBEAM™ 2 and UltraZED™ 2 using this method is very complicated in calculating the effective section properties as these sections contain complex folded-in stiffeners. In addition, the incorporation of competing buckling modes such as distortional buckling of these sections can be difficult to analyse. To overcome difficulties of using Eurocode 3 or such a standard with the Effective Width Method for determining the strength of these sections, the Direct Strength Method is adopted in this paper. Four-point beam bending tests were carried out to determine the buckling and ultimate bending capacities of the UltraBEAM™ 2 and UltraZED™ 2 sections. Results from both experimental testing and Finite Element analysis were initially used as validation for the design using the Direct Strength Method. The Direct Strength Method's results were then compared with the experimental test results for a broader data in which the UltraBEAM™ 2 and UltraZED™ 2 sections had a range of different width-to-thickness ratios.

40|$|The dynamic {{characteristics}} of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) present a control problem that classical methods cannot often accommodate easily. Fundamentally, AUV dynamics are highly non-linear, {{and the relative}} similarity between the linear and angular velocities about each degree of freedom means that control schemes employed within other flight vehicles are not always applicable. In such instances, intelligent control strategies offer a more sophisticated approach {{to the design of}} the control algorithm. Neurofuzzy control is one such technique, which fuses the beneficial properties of neural networks and fuzzy logic in a hybrid control architecture. Such an approach is highly suited to development of an autopilot for an AUV. Specifically, the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is discussed in Chapter 4 as an effective new approach for neurally tuning course-changing fuzzy autopilots. However, the limitation of this technique is that it cannot be used for developing multivariable fuzzy structures. Consequently, the co-active ANFIS (CANFIS) architecture is developed and employed as a novel multi variable AUV autopilot within Chapter 5, whereby simultaneous control of the AUV yaw and <b>roll</b> <b>channels</b> is achieved. Moreover, this structure is flexible in that it is extended in Chapter 6 to perform on-line control of the AUV leading to a novel autopilot design that can accommodate changing vehicle pay loads and environmental disturbances. Whilst the typical ANFIS and CANFIS structures prove effective for AUV control system design, the well known properties of radial basis function networks (RBFN) offer a more flexible controller architecture. Chapter 7 presents a new approach to fuzzy modelling and employs both ANFIS and CANFIS structures with non-linear consequent functions of composite Gaussian form. This merger of CANFIS and a RBFN lends itself naturally to tuning with an extended form of the hybrid learning rule, and provides a very effective approach to intelligent controller development.
