However, Cortona's panegyric trompe-l'œil extravaganzas may be less popular in a world familiar with minimalism and such like, yet they are precursors of the sunny figures and cherubim infested with rococo excesses.

500|$|Cochrane {{argues that}} while {{each of the}} schools of thought he has {{considered}} has problems, they all have something important {{to contribute to the}} debate. Utilitarianism's most important contribution is its focus on sentience, but its major failing is its lack of respect for individuals. Liberalism, on the other hand, asserts the centrality of the individual. Communitarianism, though it is too ready to attribute cohesion to the values of a given society, observes that individuals can flourish only within appropriate communities, and stresses the importance of changing the views of society at large. This latter idea is shared by Marxism, which points out that legal change does not necessarily equate to effective change. While Cochrane does not agree that capitalism must be overthrown, he recognises that [...] "fundamental shifts in the organisation, norms and institutions of society" [...] are needed for justice to be extended to animals. Care-based feminist approaches, despite Cochrane's criticism, <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> emotions and sympathy should not be ignored.|$|E

He praised [...] "Tapestry" [...] for endorsing the Q/Picard chemistry at the heart of Q episodes, and said that Stewart and de Lancie [...] "play off each other magnificently".

In February 2014, Gunn {{revealed that}} the film would incorporate songs from the 1960s and 1970s, such as [...] "Hooked on a Feeling", on a mixtape in Quill's Walkman, which acts as a way for him to stay connected to the Earth, home, and family he lost. In May 2014, Gunn added that using the songs from the 60s and 70s were [...] "cultural reference points", saying, [...] "It’s striking the balance throughout the whole movie, through something that is very unique, but also something that is easily accessible to people at the same time.

500|$|The centrepiece of act 3, {{perhaps of}} the entire opera, is Orfeo's {{extended}} aria [...] "Possente spirto e formidabil nume" [...] ("Mighty spirit and powerful divinity"), by which he attempts to persuade Caronte {{to allow him to}} enter Hades. Monteverdi's vocal embellishments and virtuoso accompaniment provide what Carter describes as [...] "one of the most compelling visual and aural representations" [...] in early opera. Instrumental colour is provided by a chitarrone, a pipe-organ, two violins, two cornetts and a double-harp. This array, according to music historian and analyst John Whenham, is intended to suggest that Orfeo is harnessing all the available forces of music to support his plea. In act 4 the impersonal coldness of the Underworld is broken by the warmth of Proserpina's singing on behalf of Orfeo, a warmth that is retained until the dramatic moment at which Orfeo [...] "looks back". The cold sounds of the sinfonia from the beginning of act 3 then <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> the Underworld is, after all, entirely devoid of human feeling. The brief final act, which sees Orfeo's rescue and metamorphosis, is framed by the final appearance of La musica's ritornello and the lively moresca that ends the opera. This dance, says Ringer, recalls the jigs danced at the end of Shakespeare's tragedies, and provides a means of bringing the audience back to their everyday world, [...] "just as the toccata had led them into another realm some two hours before. The toccata and the moresca unite courtly reality with operatic illusion." ...|$|E

[...] The New York Observer writer Foster Kamer mused, [...] "remember early Kanye? These guys finally do.

500|$|Critics at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century believed that the poem's use of sound and tone made it great. The French critic Louis Cazamian claimed in 1927 that Gray [...] "discovered rhythms, utilised the power of sounds, and even created evocations. The triumph of this sensibility allied to so much art is to be seen in the famous Elegy, which from a somewhat reasoning and moralizing emotion has educed a grave, full, melodiously monotonous song, in which a century weaned from the music of the soul tasted all the sadness of eventide, of death, and of the tender musing upon self." [...] I. A. Richards, following in 1929, declared that the merits of the poem come from its tone: [...] "poetry, which has no other very remarkable qualities, may sometimes take very high rank simply because the poet's attitude to his listenersin view of what he has to sayis so perfect. Gray and Dryden are notable examples. Gray's Elegy, indeed, might stand as a supreme instance to show how powerful an exquisitely adjusted tone may be. It would be difficult to maintain that the thought in this poem is either striking or original, or that its feeling is exceptional." [...] He continued: [...] "the Elegy may usefully <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> boldness and originality are not necessities for great poetry. But these thoughts and feelings, in part because of their significance and their nearness to us, are peculiarly difficult to express without faults... Gray, however, without overstressing any point composes a long address, perfectly accommodating his familiar feelings towards the subject and his awareness of the inevitable triteness of the only possible reflections, to the discriminating attention of his audience. And this is the source of his triumph." ...|$|E
500|$|Immanuel Kant, {{a central}} figure of the Age of Enlightenment, {{likewise}} claimed that two things filled his mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the oftener and more steadily they were reflected on: [...] "the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me... the latter begins from my invisible self, my personality, and exhibits me in a world which has true infinity but which I recognise myself as existing in a universal and necessary (and not only, as in the first case, contingent) connection." [...] The 'universal connection' referred to here is Kant's categorical imperative: [...] "act only according to that maxim by which you can {{at the same time}} will that it should become a universal law." [...] Kant considered critical conscience to be an internal court in which our thoughts accuse or excuse one another; he acknowledged that morally mature people do often describe contentment or peace in the soul after following conscience to perform a duty, but argued that for such acts to produce virtue their primary motivation should simply be duty, not expectation of any such bliss. Rousseau expressed a similar view that conscience somehow connected man to a greater metaphysical unity. John Plamenatz in his critical examination of Rousseau's work considered that conscience was there defined as the feeling that urges us, in spite of contrary passions, towards two harmonies: the one within our minds and between our passions, and the other within society and between its members; [...] "the weakest can appeal to it in the strongest, and the appeal, though often unsuccessful, is always disturbing. However, corrupted by power or wealth we may be, either as possessors of them or as victims, there is something in us serving to <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> this corruption is against nature." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film has}} {{received}} mixed reviews. Some reviewers disliked Bond's clown costume, gorilla outfit and Tarzan yell during a jungle chase. James Berardinelli {{claimed that the}} movie was long and confusing, and strongly criticised Steven Berkoff's performance, describing it as [...] "offensively bad" [...] and the worst performance of any Bond villain. By contrast, the elegance of the film locations in India, and the stunts on aircraft and the train were appreciated. Jeffrey Westhoff at Rotten Tomatoes praised Roger Moore as being [...] "". Neal Gabler and Jeffrey Lyons at the TV-show Sneak Previews praised the film and said [...] "Octopussy delivers" [...] and [...] "The nice thing about Octopussy is that it's going back-to-basics, less gadgets, more hand-to-hand combat. It's more of an adventure movie in a more traditional sense and I like it for that". Danny Peary wrote that Octopussy [...] "has slow spots, little humour, and villains who aren’t nearly of the calibre of Dr. No, Goldfinger, or Blofeld. Also, the filmmakers {{make the mistake of}} demeaning Bond by having him swing through the trees and emitting a Tarzan cry and having him hide in a gorilla suit and later disguise himself as a clown (who all the kids at the circus laugh at). It’s as if they’re trying to <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> everything is tongue-in-cheek, but that makes little sense, for the film is much more serious than typical Bond outings – in fact, it recalls the tone of From Russia with Love." [...] Entertainment Weekly chose Octopussy as the third worst Bond film, while Norman Wilner of MSN chose it as the eighth worst, and IGN chose it as the seventh worst. The review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 42% rating.|$|E

Chris Richards of The Washington Post ranked it number two on his list and stated, [...] "Instead of blushing over their embarrassment of riches, pop's most intriguing partnership delivered a self-congratulatory opus that was adventurous enough to <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> they're rap visionaries first, 1 percent bazillionaires second. The A.V. Club ranked the it number nine on its year-end list, commenting that [...] "Watch The Throne thrives on the bristling tension between Kanye's live-wire energy and rule-breaking abandon, and Jay-Z's innate cautiousness. It's an album of the moment—a point underlined by the presence of Frank Ocean on two tracks—yet it has the substance to endure." [...] Stereogum placed Watch the Throne at number 10 on its list of the [...] "Top 50 albums of 2011" [...] while Pitchfork Media placed the album at number 21 on its list.
