Firstly, the <b>radio</b> wave <b>propagation</b> strategies are analyzed in some rooms with router of point to point Ad hoc network.

25|$|In 1912, the U.S. Congress imposed the Radio Act of 1912 on amateur radio operators, {{limiting}} their operations to frequencies above 1.5MHz (wavelength 200 meters or smaller).

The peak-phase includes oscillation of MOF with periodicity of approximately 5...10 minutes. The propagation range for Es single-hop is typically 1000 to 2000km, but with multi-hop, double range is observed. The signals are very strong but also with slow deep fading.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Two {{main steps}} {{on the way to}} more {{realistic}} simulations of mobile ad-hoc networks are the introduction of realistic mobility and sophisticated <b>radio</b> wave <b>propagation</b> models. Both have strong impact on the performance of mobile ad-hoc networks, e. g. the performance of routing protocols changes with these models. In this paper we introduce a framework which combines realistic mobility and <b>radio</b> wave <b>propagation</b> models. Our approach consists of a mobility generator and an obstacle model for the <b>radio</b> wave <b>propagation.</b> It enables researchers to create realistic simulation setups and thus helps to correctly evaluate new algorithms and protocols. For the mobility generation a wide variety of well understood random mobility models is combined with a graph based zone model, where each zone has its own mobility model. To achieve a realistic <b>radio</b> wave <b>propagation</b> model a ray-tracing approach is used. The integration of these two techniques allows to create simulation setups that closely model reality. ...|$|R
25|$|Due to its link {{to other}} kinds of solar activity, sunspot {{occurrence}} {{can be used to}} help predict space weather, the state of the ionosphere, and hence the conditions of short-wave <b>radio</b> <b>propagation</b> or satellite communications. Solar activity (and the solar cycle) have been implicated in global warming, originally the role of the Maunder Minimum of sunspot occurrence in the Little Ice Age in European winter climate. Sunspots themselves, in terms of the magnitude of their radiant-energy deficit, have a weak effect on terrestrial climate in a direct sense. On longer time scales, such as the solar cycle, other magnetic phenomena (faculae and the chromospheric network) correlate with sunspot occurrence.|$|E
25|$|Low-{{frequency}} {{radio waves}} travel easily through brick and stone and VLF even penetrates sea-water. As the frequency rises, absorption effects become more important. At microwave or higher frequencies, absorption by molecular resonances {{in the atmosphere}} (mostly from water, H2O and oxygen, O2) {{is a major factor}} in <b>radio</b> <b>propagation.</b> For example, in the 58–60GHz band, there is a major absorption peak which makes this band useless for long-distance use. This phenomenon was first discovered during radar research in World War II. Above about 400GHz, the Earth's atmosphere blocks most of the spectrum while still passing some - up to UV light, which is blocked by ozone - but visible light and some of the near-infrared is transmitted.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{introduces}} an efﬁcient {{method for}} predicting mobile signal reception in satellite communications. The <b>radio</b> wave <b>propagation</b> between a satellite and a land receiver leads to {{two kinds of}} fading: slow-fading due to shadowing effect and fast-fading due to multipath effect. In order to model these ﬂuctuations in the received signal and {{take into consideration the}} local area speciﬁcities, this paper propose a novel approach combining statistical and deterministic properties of <b>radio</b> <b>propagations.</b> For slow-fading, we use an efﬁcient estimation of the local mean based on signal's coherence distance; for fast-fading, the principal parameter of Nakagami-m model can be estimated according to multipath nature, i. e., combination of electromagnetic interactions (reﬂections and diffractions) between radio wave and environment.

As far as we know, there are no standards of scene partitioning for high-speed rail (HSR) scenarios, and therefore we propose the <b>radio</b> wave <b>propagation</b> scene partitioning scheme for HSR scenarios in this paper. Based on our measurements along the Wuhan-Guangzhou HSR, Zhengzhou-Xian passenger-dedicated line, Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan passenger-dedicated line, and Beijing-Tianjin intercity line in China, whose operation speeds are above 300 [*]km/h, {{and based on the}} investigations on Beijing South Railway Station, Zhengzhou Railway Station, Wuhan Railway Station, Changsha Railway Station, Xian North Railway Station, Shijiazhuang North Railway Station, Taiyuan Railway Station, and Tianjin Railway Station, we obtain an overview of HSR propagation channels and record many valuable measurement data for HSR scenarios. On the basis of these measurements and investigations, we partitioned the HSR scene into twelve scenarios. Further work on theoretical analysis based on <b>radio</b> wave <b>propagation</b> mechanisms, such as reflection and diffraction, may lead us to develop the standard of <b>radio</b> wave <b>propagation</b> scene partitioning for HSR.
