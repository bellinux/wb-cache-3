The conflicting primary longitudinal suspension requirements of high speed stability and curving performance limit the development of rail vehicle technology. This paper presents a novel magnetorheological fluid based joint with variable stiffness characteristics for the purpose of overcoming this parameter conflict. Firstly, the joint design and working principle is developed. Following this, a prototype is tested by MTS to characterize its variable stiffness properties under a range of conditions.

40|$|Complex {{built-up}} {{structures such as}} vehicles have {{a variety}} of joint types, such as spot-welds, bolted joints, rubber joints, etc. Rubber joints highly contribute to the non-linear level of the assembled structure, and represent a major source of modeling uncertainties and variability. In the general framework of developing engineering tools for virtual prototyping and product refinement, the modeling of the NVH behavior of rubber joints involve the computational burden of including a highly detailed non-linear model of the joint and the uncertainties and variability typical of that joint in a full-scale system model. In addition, certain non-linear visco-elastic behaviors typical of rubber materials are yet not fully understood and consequently not yet implemented in commercial FE codes. However, in an engineering first design phase the knowledge on the joint rubber material properties is typically poor, and the working conditions a <b>rubber</b> <b>joint</b> will experience are generally not known in detail. This lack of knowledge often does not justify the computational burden and the modeling effort of including highly detailed non-linear models of the joint in a full-scale system model. As the majority of rubber joints in NVH applications can be considered as working on a pre-loaded state under vibrations, the focus of this thesis is on the effects at full-scale level of the non-linear quasi-static and the non-linear visco-elastic <b>rubber</b> <b>joint</b> behaviors. This thesis consists of two contributions: first, a single-level non-deterministic modeling methodology is proposed to consider the Payne effect, a specific non-linear visco-elastic rubber behavior, in the evaluation of the dynamic response of a full-scale system; second, the single-level approach is extended to a three-level solution scheme, involving a material, a component and a system level, to reduce the computational burden introduced by the non-deterministic approach and to include non-linear quasi-static effects. The proposed three-level non-deterministic modeling methodology is a consistent step in the development of virtual prototyping and product refinement engineering tools for the modeling of the NVH behavior of rubber joints in real-life applications; and can be considered, in between the fully non-linear and the fully linear modeling approaches, as a tool to evaluate in a computationally convenient way the sensitivity of the dynamic behavior of a full-scale system model to the <b>rubber</b> <b>joint</b> properties most relevant for NVH applications. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Within the INSYSME Project, {{funded in}} the 7 th Framework Program by the Commis- sion of the European Communities and aimed at {{developing}} innovative systems for masonry enclosures walls, the University of Padova and ANDIL (Italian Association of Clay Bricks and Roofing Tiles Pro- ducers) proposed a construction system named DRES (Damage Reduction Enclosure System).

40|$|With the popularisation {{and rapid}} {{development}} of railway transportation, {{how to maintain}} train stability and reduce unwanted vibration to make the ride more comfortable has become an emerging research topic. This is why this project has included magnetorheological (MR) technology into railway vehicles to improve their performance. Critical speed is an index and a key technology that directly indicates train stability, {{which is why the}} critical speeds of trains are calculated and analysed based on the dynamic equations of railway vehicles. These analyses revealed that secondary lateral damping and primary longitudinal stiffness are the most sensitive suspension parameters influencing critical speeds. In an attempt to improve dynamic performance, the secondary lateral dampers were replaced with conventional magnetorheological fluid (MRF) dampers; with the simulation and experimental results indicating that the semi-active suspension installed with MR dampers raised the critical speed and achieved a higher level of stability. The primary longitudinal stiffness is meant to be stiff when a train is running straight to maintain the stability and then soft when the train is turning, for better trafficability. To solve this dilemma, an innovative magnetorheological elastomer (MRE) based primary longitudinal <b>rubber</b> <b>joint</b> with variable stiffness characteristics has been developed. The simulation shows that controlling the MRE joint when a train runs on straight and curved track can satisfy these apparently conflicting requirements and realise good trafficability on curved track and high stability on straight track...|$|E

50|$|Studies for {{the design}} of a new battle tank started as early as 1951.

For the first time, an extremely compact opposed-piston engine was used : the 4TD, designed by the plant's engine design team. The transmission system comprised two lateral gears on each side of the engine. Those two innovations yielded a very short engine compartment with the opening located beneath the turret. The engine compartment volume was almost half that of the T-54.

The vulcanized product of <b>Rubber</b> Seal <b>Joint</b> Rings for Water Supply were then tested their physical properties.

40|$|For {{this thesis}} an additively manufactured(AM) glass {{connection}} was researched. The {{aim was to}} see if it was possible to use plastic based AM for end use parts in the façade. This was done in three parts, which are presented in this thesis. The first part consists of research in all currently available technology that could be used to create such a connection. The following section is about the design process of the AM connection and its engineering. The final part of the research further validates the design by means of structural tests and a rough price comparison to already existing glass connections. The first part of this research focused on glass connections, additive manufacturing and topology optimization. This was primarily literature research that gave insight into which existing bases could be used to build on further in this project. The research showed that the spider profile has the most potential for further development and become a new sort of connection. The research also provided insight in the different AM technology’s that could make the new connection. That research was necessary to selected the final production method an used materials. In the final part of the literature study insight in topology optimization was obtained to design the connection with the help of topology optimization. The findings from the first part of the research provided the basis for the design and engineering processes of this new AM glass connection. The connection was designed with the help of topology optimization. The idea behind the optimization was to reduce the stresses in the glass and to attach the connection to the glass without drilling. The result of the optimization was a connection that has the shape of a line and that would be bonded to the glass with Transparant Silicone Structural Adhesive better known as TSSA. This connection consists of a number of different elements. The first is a separate AM piece that would be laminated to the glass and could be inserted into the remainder of the joint that connects four corners of four different glass plates. The second element is adapted to allow for the free movement of the glass panels by locally removing material so it would be weaker in one direction. Alternatively, it is given a power joint, which is a <b>rubber</b> <b>joint</b> that allows for movement in all directions. This connection was calculated multiple times to see how the connection would perform. In the final part of this thesis the joint itself was researched to further validate the connection. This was done by making a prototype of the connection to see how everything could work and if it was actually suitable for production. For this validation, process a number of tests were done on smaller specimens to show how strong the material is and to give validation to the calculations. Finally, a small study was done in to the market potential of custom glass connections like this one by making price comparisnos to currently existing spider profiles. Building Technolog...|$|E

Rear-wheel drive cars have commonly used a lengthwise propeller shaft with a <b>rubber</b> doughnut <b>joint</b> at the gearbox end (limited movement) and a universal joint at the rear axle (greater movement), or vice versa.

5000|$|... “Unlearning” is becoming, through Starbuck’s {{longitudinal}} case studies, a {{model for}} preventing and dealing with crises (Starbuck et al., 1976, pp. 49-54; 1977d; 1978; 1984a; 1988c; 1989). As a prevention, unlearning counteracts the inertia of learning. Busy with applying for old programs, organizations are lacking time to invent new behavioral patterns, and moreover, may absorb in their behavioral program the sparkles of failure as it conforms to their ideology. Therefore, belief in past successes flattens variations and flaws by introducing ex-post institutional conformity to dysfunctional behaviors. In the Challenger’s explosion case, NASA engineers had confidence in the tests of <b>rubber</b> <b>joints</b> of the shuttle boosters. “In September 1984, Mulloy talks of a ‘tolerable erosion’; and in February 1985, Mulloy and Thiokol described the leak in the joints as an ‘acceptable risk’ (Starbuck and Milliken, 1988c, p. 327). The second finding is that ‘fine-tuning’ can finally {{be the source of}} failure (p. 335) because it creates sequences of experimentation which are believed to have the virtue to test limits of theoretical knowledge (p. 337). Challenging continuous improvement theory, Starbuck advocated dissension and counter-intuitive experimentation (1984a, 1988b, 1993). Hence, if crises are occasions to learn, they are also occasions to discover, and beliefs do not explain events (1983, p. 100), and more numerous are organizations that learn and they collapse more than organizations that unlearn preventively (1981). Human and organizational flaws appear in Starbuck theories are autonomous developments of behavioral programs, showing the author’s taste for relativeness and non-determiness, yet acknowledge managers’ distortions in detecting and sensemaking of stimuli for which they are simultaneously the passive receivers and the active emoters (1988d).|$|R

50|$|The {{powered axles}} of the ER2 {{trainset}} are individually driven: each axle {{is powered by}} its own traction motor, which {{is connected to the}} axle by a pair of spur gears with a torque ratio of 3.17 (73:23) in a fully enclosed gearbox. The large gear with a transmission modulus of 10 is mounted directly on the axle, whereas the small gear is on a shaft which is mounted on 2 ball bearings (on early trains) or roller bearings (on later trains). The gearbox casing is mounted on the axle by means of a sealed roller bearing, and is also attached to the truck frame via a special suspension. Initially this suspension comprised a sickle-shaped link with 2 rubber and metal shock absorbers, but beginning in 1969 this was replaced by a vertical rod with 4 such shock absorbers (as on the ER22). During motion of the train, the frame-suspended motors constantly move relative to the axles, which requires some kind of flexible drive to accommodate this motion. On early ER2s this was achieved by means of a jaw coupling between the motor shaft and the intermediate drive shaft, but on later trains, <b>rubber</b> rag <b>joints</b> were used instead. The first such joint was fitted to an ER2 in 1964 as an experiment; in late 1965, five more prototypes with rubber couplings were built, and from 1966 onward these became standard on all new ER2s.|$|R
40|$|Waterborne {{adhesives}} for rubber to metal bonding {{have been}} available since 1990. However, published information about their formulation has been limited, as proprietary restrictions are exercised by companies. As a consequence, the way these adhesives interact with substrates has not been studied extensively. With the aim of investigating the effect the components of a waterborne adhesive have on rubber to metal bonding, fractional factorial and surface response methodologies of design of experiments were employed in this study. Twenty six formulations were prepared with a polychloroprene latex as the adhesive polymer. Viscosity, wettability and non-volatile solids content were measured with each liquid adhesive, while the mechanical strength was evaluated by applying a tensile mechanical stress over cured solid adhesive films. Adhesion properties were evaluated by using a single lap-shear test on metal to metal joints and a pull-out test on <b>rubber</b> to metal <b>joints.</b> The {{results showed that the}} components with the largest relative influence on cohesive and adhesives forces were tackifier resin, silicon dioxide and polychloroprene latex type. In order to better understand the contributions of these variables, mathematical models correlating them with the response variables were obtained.

40|$|The {{competitiveness}} of timber as structural material in large structures is often {{governed by the}} cost of structural joints. Tests indicate that the new joint concept presented herein using glued wood-to-steel plate joints can possibly reduce the cost by matching joint strength to member strength. The design is inspired by two previously proposed designs using a single large dowel and using a rubber foil interlayer in adhesive joints. Analytical 1 D and numerical 3 D models of the bond line are proposed {{in order to further}} develop the concept, both {{in the case of a}} traditional adhesive joint and for the innovative <b>rubber</b> foil adhesive <b>joint.</b> The glued wood-to-steel plate joints studied are lap joints with a load bearing capacity assumed to be governed by failure within or along the bond line. In the 1 D and 3 D structural models both linear elastic and non-linear fracture mechanics were applied, with the non-linear fracture mechanics model taking into account the gradual damage fracture softening in a fracture zone. For the conventional type of bond line it was found that bond line softening needs to be considered for adequate strength analysis while it was not needed for a bond line with a rubber foil. The computational results are compared to previous full scale test results. The numerical results show good agreement and the analytical results reasonable agreement. When using a high strength adhesive, the strength of the wood along the bond line is governing joint failure. For this case, the analyses predict a 150 % load bearing capacity increase by the introduction of a rubber foil as compared to a traditional design. The test results indicated an even higher increase...|$|R
