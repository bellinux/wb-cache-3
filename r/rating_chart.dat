40|$|This article {{studies the}} {{monitoring}} of the attribute events based on statistical computation and analyses. The size of an attribute event is an integer rather than a continuous variable. For example, the detection of a product lot containing defectives is an attribute event, the size {{of which is the}} number of defectives found in this lot. While many control charts have been developed for monitoring the time interval (T) between the occurrences of an event, many other attribute charts may be employed to examine the size (C) of the event. However, these two types of control charts have been investigated and applied separately with limited syntheses in Statistical Process Control (SPC). This article presents a single SPC <b>chart</b> (called the <b>rate</b> <b>chart</b> for attribute, or <b>rate</b> <b>chart</b> in short) for simultaneously monitoring the time interval T and size Cof an attribute event based on the ratio between C and T. Our studies show that the new chart is more effective for detecting the out-of-control status of the attribute event compared with an individual t chart or an individual c chart, as well as a combined chart.

40|$|Through-feed {{centerless}} grinding is a precision finishing process used to manufacture circular components. This dissertation investigates the workpiece shape generating mechanism in the through-feed {{centerless grinding}} process. Specifically, the workpiece lobing mechanism and axial guidance through the grinding gap were studied. ^ To study the workpiece lobing mechanism, a computer simulation of the plunge centerless grinding process was developed. This simulation was experimentally verified {{by comparing the}} harmonic spectra of simulated workpieces with the spectra of workpieces ground with similar set-up parameters. The simulation correctly predicted which frequencies on the workpiece surface were more susceptible to roundness errors than others. These results were found to also be compatible with a previous linear lobing model (ZHOU 94). The plunge lobing analysis was then extended to the through-feed case {{by means of an}} average growth <b>rate</b> <b>chart.</b> This chart characterizes the workpiece lobing stability for a given through-feed set-up. Again, experimental studies were conducted to verify the accuracy of this model and it was determined that the average growth <b>rate</b> <b>chart</b> was effective in assessing the workpiece lobing stability for the case of short workpieces like bearing rings. ^ To address the problem of controlling the workpiece cylindrical form, a simulation of the workpiece supporting system was developed.

It was also proposed to use this type of simulation as an objective function to optimize the workpiece guidance system for specific applications. ...|$|R

Forty five health visitors, 28 general practitioner principals and registrars, and nine community paediatricians provided 328 chart ratings.

The hope was that these loans would put them on a faster development path through higher investment and faster growth. But as debt ratios reached very high levels in the 1980 s, it became clear that for many of these countries, repayment would not just constrain economic performance but be virtually impossible. Thus, in the 1980 s, several middle-income countries—particularly in Latin America—faced severe debt crises and, in the mid- 1990 s, the IM...|$|R
