5|$|Cannae {{played a}} major <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> {{military}} structure and tactical organization of the Roman Republican army. At Cannae, the Roman infantry assumed a formation similar to the Greek phalanx. This left them vulnerable to Hannibal's tactic of double envelopment since their inability to maneuver independently from {{the mass of the}} army made it impossible for them to counter the strategic encirclement used by the Carthaginian cavalry. The laws of the Roman state requiring command to alternate between the two consuls restricted strategic consistency.|$|E
5|$|Overtime, {{traditional}} Calvinism played {{less of a}} <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> church's doctrines and practices—it {{was influenced}} by Arminianism and revivalism early in the 19th century, liberal theology late in the 19th century, and neo-orthodoxy by the mid-20th century. The theological tensions within the denomination were {{played out in the}} Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy of the 1920s and 1930s, a conflict that {{led to the development of}} Christian fundamentalism and has historical importance to modern American Evangelicalism. Conservatives dissatisfied with liberal trends left to form the Orthodox Presbyterian Church in 1936.|$|E
5|$|The Depression of the 1930s exposed glaring {{weaknesses}} in federal-provincial financial arrangements. Canada's poorer provinces {{found it impossible}} to cope with widespread poverty and hunger while the federal government resisted taking full responsibility for unemployment relief. By 1937, conditions had become so desperate that the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan faced bankruptcy. Finally, in August 1937, Prime Minister King appointed the Royal Commission on Dominion-Provincial Relations, popularly known as the Rowell-Sirois Commission. According to biographer Stephen Henderson, Macdonald played an important <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> Commission's final recommendations.|$|E

5|$|The four NATO {{aircraft}} {{shot down}} during Operation Deny Flight also forced NATO members to consider new defensive measures for their aircraft, including increased stealth capabilities. Deny Flight also demonstrated {{the necessity of}} better communications and integration among forces operating together, and led to some calls for technical training of UN personnel to work with NATO military systems. Finally, {{the rules of engagement}} established under Deny Flight also played an important <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> rules of engagement for later NATO operations other than war, including Operation Joint Endeavor, and even NATO operations in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|In works where elves are {{the main}} characters, such as The Silmarillion or Wendy and Richard Pini’s comic book series Elfquest, elves exhibit a similar range of {{behaviour}} to a human cast, distinguished largely by their superhuman physical powers. However, where narratives are more human-centered, as in The Lord of the Rings, elves tend to sustain their role as powerful, sometimes threatening, outsiders. Despite the obvious fictionality of fantasy novels and games, scholars have found that elves in these works {{continue to have a}} subtle <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> real-life identities of their audiences. For example, elves can function to encode real-world racial others in video games, or to influence gender-norms through literature.|$|E
5|$|Trade winds blow {{from east}} to west across the Hawaiian islands, and the {{presence}} of Mauna Loa strongly affects the local climate. At low elevations, the eastern (windward) side of the volcano receives heavy rain; the city of Hilo is the wettest in the United States. The rainfall supports extensive forestation. The western (leeward) side has a much drier climate. At higher elevations, the amount of precipitation decreases, and skies are very often clear. Very low temperatures mean that precipitation often occurs in the form of snow, and the summit of Mauna Loa is described as a periglacial region, where freezing and thawing play a significant <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> landscape.|$|E

5|$|Alpine {{symbolism}} {{has played}} an essential <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> {{history of the}} country and the Swiss national identity. Nowadays some concentrated mountain areas have a strong highly energetic ski resort culture in winter, and a hiking (ger: das Wandern) or Mountain biking culture in summer. Other areas throughout the year have a recreational culture that caters to tourism, yet the quieter seasons are spring and autumn when there are fewer visitors. A traditional farmer and herder culture also predominates in many areas and small farms are omnipresent outside the cities. Folk art is kept alive in organisations all over the country. In Switzerland it is mostly expressed in music, dance, poetry, wood carving and embroidery. The alphorn, a trumpet-like musical instrument made of wood, has become alongside yodeling and the accordion an epitome of traditional Swiss music.|$|E
5|$|Heliade Rădulescu is {{considered}} one of the foremost champions of Romanian culture from the first half of the 19th century, having first risen to prominence through his association with Gheorghe Lazăr and his support of Lazăr's drive for discontinuing education in Greek. Over the following decades, he had a major <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> modern Romanian language, but caused controversy when he advocated the massive introduction of Italian neologisms into the Romanian lexis. A Romantic nationalist landowner siding with moderate liberals, Heliade was among the leaders of the 1848 Wallachian revolution, after which he was forced to spend several years in exile. Adopting an original form of conservatism, which emphasized the role of the aristocratic boyars in Romanian history, he was rewarded for supporting the Ottoman Empire and clashed with the radical wing of the 1848 revolutionaries.|$|E
5|$|This traditional, {{historical}} {{portrayal of}} the North-West Mounted Police influenced that of the RCMP, who used their predecessor's history {{to build their own}} status as a Canadian national symbol. Although the RCMP as an organisation formally dates from 1920, the modern force chose to trace its own history back to the foundation of the mounted police in 1873, rather than, for example, drawing on the Dominion Police's foundation date of 1868. The RCMP's centennial in 1973 saw celebratory events across Canada, various historical publications and even proposals – turned down by the mounted police – for a reenactment of the March West. The RCMP used the celebrations to redefine the early history of the mounted police in line with contemporary policing objectives, focusing on the force's <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> evolution of a liberal, tolerant, modern Canada.|$|E

5|$|Graham {{was forced}} to {{publicly}} defend his decision, while questions were raised about the knowledge and approval of his decision as the tactical commander {{by a number of}} senior Army officers, including then Commander Australian Forces Vietnam, Major General Tim Vincent, the Chief of General Staff (CGS), Lieutenant General Thomas Daly, and the Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, General John Wilton, all of whom had acquiesced to its construction. Meanwhile, as DCGS Graham was second only to Daly in the daily running of the Australian Army. During this time Graham unsuccessfully sought the retention of national service following the eventual Australian withdrawal from Vietnam, arguing that it was necessary to further expand the Regular Army. He later managed the draw-down of Australian forces in Vietnam, and played a leading <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> post-war Army. Graham was appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) Northern Command in 1973 and later Commander 1st Division. He subsequently filled the position of head of the Australian Defence Staff in London over the period 1974–76. Graham was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in the 1975 Queen's Birthday Honours. He retired in March 1977.|$|E

40|$|On {{the open}} {{coast of the}} Changjiang Delta, waves {{temporally}} play their dominant <b>roles</b> <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> tidal-flat profile, especially during typhoons. Detailed analyses are presented of the variations in grain sizes of surface sediments and bed level, measured {{in the summer of}} 1999 at Nanhui mudflats, south flank of the Changjiang Delta, China. Cross-shore variations in bed level are distinctly site-specific in response to waves. The site-specific erosion rates are related to local water depth, sediment properties, vegetation, and exposure time per semidiurnal tidal cycle. A great difference exists between the higher and lower intertidal mudflats bordered at the mean sea level (MSL) : the higher section is dominated by continuous accretion, while the lower section is characteristic of dynamic changes in erosion and accretion phases. Swells play their more important <b>roles</b> <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> profile than local wind-driven waves at the study mudflat, where swells propagate onshore without great barriers’ damping and local winds are not highly strengthened by distant typhoons. Storm processes are greatly modulated by tides. The magnitude of erosion is greater by a weak storm during spring tides than a strong storm during neap tides. Significant changes in entrainment capacity of tidal currents from neap to spring tides account for the different erosion and accretion models of the intertidal mudflat...|$|R
