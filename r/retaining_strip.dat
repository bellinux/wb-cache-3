40|$|<b>Retaining</b> <b>strips</b> of unlogged forest, called buffers, is {{a common}} {{strategy}} for maintaining populations of vulnerable species in production forests in Australia. I conducted a study to examine the effectiveness of buffers in maintaining populations of vulnerable bird species in jarrah forests of south-west Western Australia.

I also conducted detailed ecological studies on Golden Whistlers to determine whether buffers were important for this species and, if so, why they were important. Buffers were important in maintaining populations of vulnerable bird species after the first logging rotation. Of the six species that declined after logging, only one (the Golden Whistler) showed {{a significant decrease in}} buffers and the decrease was less than in logged forest. Buffers were important for Golden Whistlers in providing both foraging and nesting sites. Whistlers also moved the location of their territories to include buffers, indicating that they are critical for this species in production forests. Given their importance to vulnerable species, I recommend that buffers are not logged at the second logging rotation until research is conducted that demonstrates that the surrounding logged forest has matured sufficiently to support viable populations of vulnerable species...|$|R

40|$|The bi–annual report, which assesses {{current and}} {{expected}} trends in organised crime affecting the European Union, explores how a new criminal landscape is emerging, marked increasingly by highly mobile and flexible groups operating in multiple jurisdictions and criminal sectors. "Organised crime is a multi–billion euro business in Europe {{and it is}} growing in scale. The further expansion of Internet and mobile technologies, the proliferation of illicit trafficking routes and methods as well as opportunities offered by the global economic crisis, have all contributed {{to the development of}} a more potent threat from organised crime," says Rob Wainwright, Director of Europol. The report highlights the fact that criminal groups are increasingly multi–commodity and poly–criminal in their activities, gathering diverse portfolios of criminal business interests, improving their resilience at a time of economic austerity and strengthening their capability to identify and exploit new illicit markets. Activities such as carbon credit fraud, payment card fraud and commodity counterfeiting attract increasing interest due to a lower level of perceived risk. The OCTA estimates for the first time that organised crime groups derived more than 1. 5 billion euro from payment card fraud in the EU. While the introduction of the EMV chip standard provides a very high level of protection for payment card transactions within the EU, lack of wholesale implementation in other regions has compelled EU card issuers to <b>retain</b> magnetic <b>strips.</b> As a result, half the fraudulent withdrawals made with cloned EU payment cards are currently made outside the EU. Strong levels of cooperation exist between different organised crime groups, more than ever before, transcending national, ethnic, and business differences.

Here, we present the rational design and facile fabrication of graphene oxide (GO) /poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (PANIPAM) hybrid film-based bilayer actuators, which display efficient and reversible bending/unbending behaviors {{in response to}} repeated cycles of near-infrared (NIR) light irradiations. Our bilayer actuator comprises a layer of GO, and a layer of GO/PNIPAM (GP) hybrid, taking advantages of the NIR absorbance and photothermal conversion capability of GO, along with the thermo-responsiveness of PNIPAM. Upon NIR light irradiation, GO converts absorbed light into heat, which subsequently triggers the shrinkage of PANIPAM chains, leading to the bending of the bilayer actuator. Owning to the shape inertness of GO to the NIR light, repeated irradiations of NIR light cause the bilayer to shrink/relax in an asymmetric manner, consequently leading to reversible bending/unbending behaviors of the bilayer actuator. Remarkably, our actuator shows templated bending orientation once exposed to NIR light, and exhibits shape memory effect due to the incomplete recovery of PNIPAM chains. This shape memory effect is <b>retained</b> in rectangular <b>strips</b> cut from the original disk-shaped bilayer and is exploited to selectively achieve either bending or twisting deformation.

Frying was performed on either fresh or blanched strips following a conventional water treatment. The independent variables of the process were frying temperature (between 170 °C and 200 °C) and frying time (between 4 min and 6 min). A central composite rotatable design was adapted to {{study the effects of}} the independent variables on different quality attributes of potato strips. Textural quality was measured by texture profile analysis, Volodkevich tests and multiple puncture tests. Colour parameters and moisture and oil contents were also determined. The effect of frying time was more significant than the effect of frying temperature on the quality attributes, and when blanching was carried out before frying most attributes were independent of frying temperature. Frying of fresh strips at 185 °C for 4. 5 min resulted in minimum optimal points for hardness 1, hardness 2, Volodkevich parameters and oil content and saddle points for colour parameters in approximately the same combination. For models fitted for most of the quality attributes of blanched fried strips, r 2 was better and the lack of fit was not significant, although high-temperature short-time blanching before frying resulted in loss of firmness and discolouring, and increased the percentage of oil <b>retained</b> by the <b>strips,</b> causing sensorial quality loss. © Springer-Verlag 2000.

A Steckel mill produces hot rolled strip steel from cast slabs, which are heated before being converted, via roughing, to a transfer bar, of which the thickness is subsequently reduced to the desired gauge {{by means of a}} reverse rolling process performed by the Steckel mill. Coiler drums are located inside two Steckel furnaces, which are positioned {{on both sides of the}} mill stand. As the strip thickness is reduced during each pass, the length increases.

As coiler drums have a high unit cost and a significant impact on the quality of the finished product, coiler drum performance is important to Steckel mill operators.

Deterioration of the coiler drum condition over its service lifespan can adversely affect the quality of the final product, namely coiled strip.

5000|$|There {{is a lot}} of {{difference}} between restoring and repairing. Functionality may be achieved by a repair, but restoring an item properly is an art-form. Finishes might/may be stripped and redone, but it is essential that the original patination is <b>retained,</b> if possible. <b>Stripping</b> is only done as a last resort, especially with antique furniture. Engines might be rebuilt with new parts as necessary, or holes in a silver pot might/may be patched. While some of these practices are frowned on by many museums, scholars, and other experts, for many people there is little value in an antique that is unusable or not able to be displayed. Poor restoration is the bane of a trained restorer. Working on someone else's bad repair is the worst possible situation. Often with antique restoration, there are also other issues as well. For example, some collectors value [...] "patina", or also want an item to still reflect an aesthetic that shows its age- in this respect, an [...] "over restored" [...] item can actually take away from its value than if nothing has been done to the item at all.

40|$|Master of ScienceCivil EngineeringDunja PericThe {{conventional}} {{triaxial test}} {{is the primary}} laboratory test for determining the shear strength of soils. Geotechnical field conditions such as long earth dams, long embankments, long <b>retaining</b> walls, <b>strip</b> foundations, tunnels, and buried pipelines often experience plane strain states of stress. However, stress strain and load deformation responses in plane strain loading differ considerably from responses observed in the conventional triaxial test. Research has shown that soils loaded in a plane strain state are far more sensitive to imperfections than soils tested in a conventional triaxial device. Plane strain loading leads to material instability manifested as sudden localized failure, resulting in decreased load-carrying capacity of the soil and compromised geotechnical and civil infrastructures. Although previous studies have mostly focused on granular materials, this research investigated the plane strain response of clay. An undrained plane strain compression test program was devised to investigate the effects of past stress history and strain rates on strain localization in kaolin clay. Experiments were carried out in a plane strain (or biaxial) device at Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois. Because the device was heavily internally instrumented, strain localization progress was closely monitored throughout each biaxial test. Clay response in the biaxial test demonstrated three phases: (1) a homogenous response, (2) the onset and propagation of strain localization, and (3) the evolution of strain localization as a shear band. The duration of each phase was determined for each test, and a Lagrange strain tensor was used to obtain the evolution of volumetric and shear strains {{at the level of}} a shear band for three tests. Results revealed the development of large strains in these mesoscale structures. Furthermore, evolution of Mohr-Coulomb effective shear strength parameters was traced throughout the propagation and evolution phases by using two different methods. It showed that in clay samples, unlike in granular materials, the post-peak plateau, which is reached by deviatoric stress, corresponds to friction values that are significantly lower than the critical state values. Other researchers who used scanning electron microscope and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility detected a significant reorientation of clay particles inside shear bands. Their findings combined with findings in this study lead {{to the conclusion that the}} sub-meso scale mechanism responsible for large shear strains and a severe reduction in effective friction is a significant reorientation of clay particles inside shear band...|$|R

First CO oxidation, which {{was found to}} be accompanied by oxygen atom transfer from hydroxide, occurs 700 mV less positive than surface oxidation. Second, the reaction intermediate was identified by electrochemistry and additionally by infrared and Raman spectroscopy to be metal hydroxycarbonyl. ^ CO adsorption at gold monocrystalline electrodes from the atmospheric gas phase as well as from solution was investigated. The ability of CO to adsorb to near saturation coverages from the atmospheric gas phase onto gold electrodes contrasts the absence of CO adsorption on gold in ultrahigh vacuum (uhv). The extent of CO adsorption from solution did not depend on the cation identity. Adsorption of CO was strongest in more alkaline solutions and at suitably negative electrode potentials. Adsorbed CO survived electrode transfer to a second cell under some conditions. ^ The adsorbed CO was always found to inhibit the diffusion-controlled electrooxidation of solution CO. The CO adsorbs randomly at low coverage, and at high coverage it forms islands which are <b>retained</b> upon partial <b>stripping.</b> The use of rotated disk voltammetry to extract kinetic information failed due to increased CO adsorption when the electrode was rotated. ^ The oxidation of formamide at polycrystalline electrodes was studied with the objective to relate changes in amide functional groups to electrooxidation behavior. The study was frustrated by the hydrolysis of amides, the coincidence of the oxidation wave of amides and of the gold surface, and the tendency of reactants to undergo photodecomposition in the laser beam during Raman spectroscopic measurements. Nevertheless, for the oxidation reaction of HCONH 2, intermediate and product species were clearly observed. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} the value for fauna of conifer and {{eucalypt}} plantations in Australia is presented. Five key reasons highlight a need for wildlife conservation as part of plantation management. These are: (1) The plantation estate in Australia is set to triple in the coming decades, and where new plantations are located {{and how they are}} managed will influence the biota that currently exist in such landscapes. This is particularly critical in many semi-cleared former grazing landscapes where the establishment of new plantations is focused. This is because: (1) (a) native vegetation communities in these areas are poorly represented in the existing reserve system, and, (b) uses such as wood and pulp production need to be balanced with other management values such as wildlife conservation. (2) The maintenance of some elements of the biota within plantations could have benefits for key ecosystem processes like pest control. (3) Although some species cannot be conserved in plantation-dominated landscapes, many species can be through the adoption of (sometimes minor) modifications to forest management. (4) The maintenance (or loss) of biota in plantations is relevant for moves toward ecological standards and the certification of plantations {{in many parts of the}} world. And, (5) simple plantation forestry which has a narrow and intensive management focus on producing a forest crop for a limited array of purposes, may not meet societal demands for a range of outputs from plantations in addition to wood and pulp. It also may not be congruent with the principles of ecological sustainability. Our review showed that almost all research undertaken in Australian plantations, both in conifers and eucalypts, highlighted the importance of landscape heterogeneity and stand structural complexity for fauna conservation. At the landscape level, patches of <b>retained</b> native vegetation, <b>strips</b> of riparian vegetation, dams, open and clearing areas can significantly increase the number of native species that occur within plantations. Some species that occur in these areas can also use adjacent planted areas, a result common to conifer and eucalypt plantations. The spatial juxtaposition of stands of varying ages throughout plantation landscapes also can contribute to the maintenance of some populations of native taxa. At the stand level, structural complexity is also important for fauna with many species responding positively to the presence of native understorey plants, the presence of windrowed logs, and logging slash left on the forest floor. The management of plantations to promote landscape heterogeneity and stand structural complexity will, in many cases, involve trade-offs that will influence wood and pulp production. The extent to which this occurs will be dependent on the objectives of plantation management and how far they extend toward the complex plantation forestry model to incorporate social and environmental values in addition to wood and pulp production...|$|R
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in the contribution of native plantations to biodiversity conservation in a variegated landscape. Eucalypt plantations are expanding rapidly in Australia; they provide conservation potential through afforestation, but their real value for native fauna requires investigation. The relative conservation value of eucalypt plantations was investigated through assessment of avifauna richness, abundance and composition with transect surveys incorporating point counts in five broad habitat types – dryland forests, riparian forests, dryland plantations, riparian plantations, and riparian pastures. A total of 73 species were recorded during formal surveys. Species richness and abundance were comparable among all habitat types except dryland plantations, which supported fewer species and in lower numbers. The avifauna assemblage differed according to broad habitat types. Forest habitats (dryland and riparian) harboured more forest- and woodland-dependent species, and a greater abundance of nectarivores and insectivores. Riparian plantations supported a similar number of forest- and woodland-dependent species to forest habitats, but also retained many open-country species. Riparian pastures had the highest cumulative species richness, reflecting a diverse mix of forest- and woodland-dependent birds and open-country species. It was the preferred habitat type for granivores and vertebrate eaters. Dryland plantations were dominated by common species and omnivores, and supported fewer forest- and woodland-dependent birds, insectivores and frugivores compared to other habitat types. The presence of riparian strips in plantations and pastures markedly increased habitat value {{for a wide range}} of avian species. The importance of riparian habitats needs to be recognised and incorporated into management policies if biodiversity conservation is to be an objective of plantation establishment. In order to determine the conservation value of native eucalypt plantations compared to regrowth forests for insectivorous birds, habitat structure variables and time budgets were quantified for two species of insectivore. In comparison to eucalypt plantations, regrowth forests supported a wider range of tree sizes, and a greater percentage cover of canopy, shrub and litter layers. Although a similar amount of native vegetation was retained in riparian and dryland plantations, there were more large, mature trees <b>retained</b> in riparian <b>strips.</b> Both the eastern yellow robin (Eopsaltria australis) and the white-browed scrubwren (Sericornis frontalis) exhibited some behavioural flexibility in response to changes in habitat structure. The eastern yellow robin utilised rough-barked trunks and stems as perches in forest habitats, switching to branches in eucalypt plantations where vertical perches were few. The white-browed scrubwren also utilised habitat-specific substrates in accordance with availability – logs in forest habitats, and grass, ferns and shrubs in plantations. Scrubwrens spent more time calling and less time actively foraging in riparian plantations than in forest habitats, suggesting differential predation risks in the different habitat types. Although the time budget for both species was similar among habitat types, dryland plantations had fewer birds. Frequent absence of both ground-foragers from dryland plantations suggests that behavioural changes cannot accommodate the absence of essential habitat features and resources in dryland plantations. This study also compared the territory size, shape and usage of an area-sensitive forest-dependent songbird, the eastern yellow robin, in four habitat types – dryland forests, riparian forests, dryland plantations and riparian plantations. Territory size and shape did not differ significantly among forest and plantation habitats; however, territories in dryland habitats were more variable in size than their riparian counterparts. The core area of concentrated activity (50 %) comprised approximately 13 % of the total size of robin territories. No significant differences in edge indices were found amongst habitat types; however, riparian habitats exhibited greater variability in territory shape. Within plantation habitats, territory occupation was closely related to the distribution of remnant and/or riparian vegetation: the eastern yellow robin showed significant preference for remnant and riparian vegetation over plantation trees. This pattern was especially pronounced in riparian plantations, as riparian vegetation on average comprised over half of the area of robin territories, and almost 75 % of the core area, amounts highly disproportionate to the percentage cover of riparian vegetation. This study suggests that plantations have the potential to provide significant conservation benefit for the avifauna of cleared and variegated landscapes. However, this benefit will be substantially increased through retention of old-growth vegetation patches and corridors within plantations, and management of the ground layer to prevent the dominance of weeds...|$|R

Based on observations, the deterioration phenomena can be classified as: a) internal phenomena, depending on the walls’ construction features: – phenomena depending on defects in the wall’s construction, such as incorrect sizing of the wall or incorrect arrangement of the stones the actual wall is built with; – phenomena depending on the walls’ “natural” deterioration processes. b) external phenomena, not depending on the walls’ construction features (Fig. 4). – of natural origin; – induced by human activity. As far as deterioration generated by natural factors that do {{not depend on the}} walls’ structure is concerned, the following phenomena have been pointed out: – failure of elements {{at the top of the}} wall (Fig. 5) due to surface water runoff (when the top of the wall is built with small-sized elements); – partial failure of the wall due to loss of stability as a result of a progressive increase of strain induced in the median part of the wall by backfill pressure. – base of the wall shifts, probably due to the force exerted by the backfill (this phenomenon can be accentuated by incorrect building of wall foundations as well as by the action of animals). As far as deterioration induced by human activity is concerned, we basically refer to the practice of abandoning farming and, consequently, to the neglect of terrace maintenance, without which terraces easily loss their benefic effects on slope stability. The maintenance consists of a series of small, neverending operations such as pulling out weeds; clearing stones from the cultivated land; tidying up and repairing dry stone walls; and cleaning drainage channels. The absence of these operations triggers the collapse of the whole hydrogeological control system constituted by the terracing. At the beginning the irrigation ditches and water collection channels become clogged (Fig. 6) : grass, stones and earth prevent rain from flowing into the proper channels, meaning that water runs over the whole surface of the terrace, which is made less permeable due to the overgrown grass that is left unmown and the weeds that suffocate the crops. The hillside, which is divided into a succession of terraces, ends up interrupting the water’s flow with drops and obstacles, causing it to become turbulent and even more erosive than a laminar flow of water over even slopes (see cemagref, 1988). In any case this subdivision of the causes of deterioration into natural and anthropogenic causes must be considered as a theoretical schematization only, which we can gather from the very meaning of terracing, i. e. the artificial shaping (therefore, decided by man) of an area that would otherwise not be farming friendly. Consequently, man is the main engine behind the “birth”, “survival” and “death” of his creation. 1. types of dry stone wall deterioration In a terraced environment that is being neglected, various kinds of failure can arise: the erosive action of water can result in the undermining of the foot of the wall <b>retaining</b> the terraced <b>strips,</b> which can then topple. Water is free to seep into the terraces in an uncontrolled and ever more violent way, generating high pore-water pressure on the walls, which start to bulge and then leading to actual landslides. Moreover, landslides and bulging walls can be caused by uncontrolled groundwater, or by a lack of maintenance on walls. The structure of the walls is weakened by frost or by the thrust of tree roots allowed to grow unchecked, thus triggering the failure of parts of the walls, starting with the top stones, which creates openings for water to flow through. It is common to see parts of wall that have collapsed, leaving a clear small scarp in the part of the backfill previously retained by the wall, and a downhil area where the rest of the wall have been accumulated mixed with the and slipped soil. When a landslide occurs, an opening is created that causes an increase in water flow rate when it rains. As a result, the next wall down is in greater danger of succumbing to deterioration itself and this eventually leads to trails of wreckage that can be clearly seen on hillsides that are being neglected 1. The wall-less earth banks, on the other hand, begin to fail when the drainage channel system is abandoned: water runs unchannelized along the banks where the grass is no longer mown, potentially causing small landslides as a result of erosion induced by the surface runoff. Terraces failure triggers a domino effect: from the top down, with the slippage of a terraced strip high up the slope eventually affecting all the strips downhill; or from the bottom up, with the collapse of a strip of land inducing instability in the wall above it, which no longer has foot protection. The urbanization of valley floors is a trait common to many terraced valleys: the morphologic situation has forced almost the entire population to cram into the only existing flat or almost flat areas, meaning the danger associated with the deterioration of the terraces lying above densely-populated areas is considerable. The abandonment of crops is generally followed by the hillside’s renaturalization as spontaneous vegetation (often weeds) takes over. This phase, which can vary in length depending on the location’s characteristics, presages the appearance of various shrubby pioneer species, which will develop and give rise to complex associations, until the wood is fully reinstated. Nonetheless, we should bear in mind that the transition from cultivated to revegetated goes through a period of extreme dangerousness, especially considering the fire risk, which is typical of the stage during which terraces are abandoned and the terraced structures deteriorate. Analysing how these renaturalization phenomena occur and how the growth of suitable species to consolidate the earth might be fostered is a rather interesting, albeit extremely complex, matter. Nonetheless, even supposing that wood growth restores stability to the hillside, this entails losing the agricultural land and cultural heritage offered by the terraced systems, which is not to be underestimated. 2. abandonment, visual conflict and disarray on the landscape So-called semi-abandonment seems to be almost as frequent in terraced areas as the abandonment problem. We frequently come across non-traditional farming techniques that fail to use the terrace structure correctly, from the point of view of function. Rubbish, such as bed frames by way of fencing and bathtubs for collecting rainwater, is often used in the farming of terraced strips, thus employing fewer financial resources and less energy. The visual conflict caused by these forms of “sub-farming” on the landscape is no less serious than the risk of hillside instability resulting from lack of maintenance, which the terraces really needed. Greenhouse farming deserves its own special mention. If built without the necessary precautions, greenhouses can cause serious damages. Even when the hillside is not completely transformed by a series of concretereinforced terraces, during heavy rains, the waterproof surface of the greenhouses still causes a surficial runoff dangerous for the terracing itself as well as the people living below. Moreover, the large amounts of chemical fertilizers, weed killers and insecticides used must be suitably removed from the terraced land so as not to pollute the area downhill or contaminate the aquifers. From the point of view of landscape ecology, greenhouse farming can be seen as an industry for all intents and purposes 2. What’s more, when it comes to how the landscape is perceived, greenhouses stand out as rigid, messy volumes that are certainly not a joy to behold, unlike a terraced hillside planted with vines or olive trees. The loss of knowledge of the terracing culture also has a considerable effect on what consolidation systems are chosen: replacing dry stone walls with reinforced concrete walls with no outlet for water, without allowing for drainage, can lead to even more serious failures...|$|R
