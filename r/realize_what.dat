25|$|Many Classical Chinese poems appear simple on the surface, but contain deeper, more {{profound}} ideas. In order to <b>realize</b> <b>what</b> these are, {{the reader is}} expected to meet the poet halfway — not just to be told something, but to actively think and feel in sympathy with the poet or the poet's persona.|$|E
25|$|Peter Morgan is {{fascinated by}} a mysterious object {{that he found}} by the shore. He finds {{out that it is}} a harp-tuning key that once belonged to the Celtic bard Taliesin. The key has a subtle magical power that enables Peter to see visions of Taliesin's life. Soon it is not only Peter who is seeing visions, and the whole family {{witnesses}} an ancient battle on Borth Bog, although they do not <b>realize</b> <b>what</b> is happening.|$|E
25|$|Zachariah – Zachariah is the ship's cook who is cast in {{the role}} of the noble character. Early on, he offers Charlotte his {{friendship}} as well as a small knife for her protection. He cares for Charlotte during her first days of seasickness, and seems to be respected by the crew, although he is at times the butt of their jokes because he is the only black person on board. He tells Charlotte that he left his home in Africa as a teenager, and had been a sailor ever since. He has never lived in America and has never been a slave. At the end of the book, it becomes clear that he does not <b>realize</b> <b>what</b> his social status would be, even as a free man in Providence, Rhode Island.|$|E

25|$|Bowman {{realizes that}} his life has been irrevocably changed. He makes Blair record a video taped {{confession}} of his illegal actions, then kills Blair and disposes of all forensic evidence of the agents' presence. Afterwards, he hunts down and kills Blair's remaining subordinates. Bowman and his closest friends begin to systematically kill ATF agents around the nation – whom Bowman views as supporting the infringement of citizen's constitutional rights, and abusing government powers – as well as politicians who had supported unconstitutional gun control legislation. Simultaneously Bowman releases the video tape of Blair to CNN, which claims that Blair and his companions have {{had a change of}} heart, <b>realize</b> <b>what</b> they are doing is wrong, and are now dedicated to killing other ATF agents. Amidst the national search for Blair and company, Bowman continues to rack up the body count.|$|E
25|$|Up to this time, Jacob Grimm {{had been}} driven only by a general thirst for knowledge, and his {{energies}} had not found any aim beyond the practical one of making himself a position in life. The first definite impulse came from the lectures of Friedrich Karl von Savigny, the celebrated investigator of Roman law, who first taught him to <b>realize</b> <b>what</b> it meant to study any science, as Wilhelm Grimm himself says {{in the preface to}} the Deutsche Grammatik (German Grammar). Savigny's lectures also awakened in him a love for historical and antiquarian investigation, which forms the structure of all his work. The two men became personally acquainted, and it was in Savigny's well-stocked library that Grimm first turned over the leaves of Bodmer's edition of the Middle High German minnesingers and other early texts, and felt an eager desire to penetrate further into the obscurities and half-revealed mysteries of their language.|$|E
25|$|Coincidentally Anytus appears, whom Socrates praises {{as the son}} of Anthemion, {{who earned}} his fortune with {{intelligence}} and hard work. He says that Anthemion had his son well-educated and so Anytus is well-suited to join the investigation. Socrates suggests that the sophists are teachers of virtue. Anytus is horrified, saying that he neither knows any, nor cares to know any. Socrates then questions why it is that men do not always produce sons of the same virtue as themselves. He alludes to other notable male figures, such as Themistocles, Aristides, Pericles and Thucydides, and casts doubt on whether these men produced sons as capable of virtue as themselves. Anytus becomes offended and accuses Socrates of slander, warning him to be careful expressing such opinions. (The historical Anytus was one of Socrates' accusers in his trial.) Socrates suggests that Anytus does not <b>realize</b> <b>what</b> slander is, and continues his dialogue with Meno as to the definition of virtue.|$|E

25|$|Joyce Summers {{is running}} a local art show for {{people from around the}} United States. A girl named Justine shows up the first day to sign in and Xander is {{immediately}} attracted to her. She offers to do a Tarot reading for him which he agrees to. Once Xander has touched her magickal deck he comes under her control and has no will of his own. Justine is building a powerful deck of Tarot cards which will allow her to control the fate of the world {{with the help of the}} goddess Kali, who, in return, wants ultimate peace on Earth. Only Justine doesn't <b>realize</b> <b>what</b> ultimate peace is and she's come to Sunnydale to collect the last four people she needs to complete her deck of cards.

500|$|... "Field Trip" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz, who described the writing process as [...] "an experience". The script went through several phases; originally, the script was supposed to feature Mulder trapped in a cave with a mysterious monster. Then, the script was changed so that both Mulder and Scully would be trapped in the cave. Finally, the story was altered so that both Mulder and Scully only believed that they two were trapped in a cave, with only Mulder beginning to <b>realize</b> <b>what</b> was actually going on.|$|E

[...] One Clinton campaign aide attempted to penetrate more deeply into Hsu's motives, remarking that Hsu's business activity [...] "was reinforced by his efforts in politics and philanthropy; he seemed like a generous guy, but only later did you <b>realize</b> <b>what</b> he was up to." ...|$|E
500|$|Kimberly Roots, {{writing for}} TV Line, {{responded to the}} kiss scene by stating, [...] "What got me – and still gets me – about this kiss is how much fire it has. This isn’t a drunken, {{convenient}} hook-up. This isn’t a let’s-see-how-this-goes peck. This is two people acting on years of something unacknowledged between them.

500|$|The {{scene in}} which Yang (Oh) and Hunt (McKidd) were partaking in couples therapy, was {{originally}} planned to be a comical moment. Vernoff commented on this: [...] "I handed them that scene 20 MINUTES BEFORE CAMERAS ROLLED. It was actually a funny scene {{right up until the}} last minute. Sandra and Kevin had smart questions – and what became crystal clear to me instantly is that this storyline could not be resolved in a humorous way. It had earned weight. Indeed, it required weight." [...] In the episode, Meredith (Pompeo) grieves her pain through constant sex with Shepherd. Vernoff explained she loves the fact that Meredith is healthy enough to <b>realize</b> <b>what</b> she is doing.

500|$|The Moving Picture Worlds Thomas Bedding {{provided}} the best {{recognition of the}} company. Bedding wrote, [...] "The Gnome Company {{seem to be working}} on, what to our minds, is the most interesting phase of the Christmas sentiment. They are making fairy pictures for young people. We fully expect to see other makers follow suit, when they <b>realize</b> <b>what</b> the real Christmas sentiment is, namely one of lightness, brightness, joyousness." [...] Advertisements for the productions show the great desire of the company to produce the three films in the December 1910 season, but interest in the Christmas and New Year's productions would have waned by mid-January 1911 with the productions still not released. Ultimately, the Gnome Motion Picture Company represents an early attempt to cater film productions to children and during the Christmas season.|$|E

500|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Hunt discussed {{working as an}} independent artist, stating [...] "Creatively it is certainly liberating, {{but the rest of}} it is really not that fun.

500|$|April 15, 2008, was the 61st {{anniversary of}} Jackie Robinson's major league debut. Over 330 team members wore number 42, {{more than the}} over 240 last year. When the teams took the field, all players, {{managers}} and coaches were wearing number 42, and was repeated at all other 14 ballparks that had scheduled games that day. All players wore number 42 at games including the Washington Nationals' game at the New York Mets, Pittsburgh's game at the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Los Angeles Angels' game at the Texas Rangers. The Oakland Athletics, St. Louis Cardinals and Tampa Bay Rays also wore number 42, increasing the total to nine teams. [...] "The significance of Jackie Robinson Day {{is not lost on}} anyone", said Bob DuPuy.

It's right there in the title, so you'd think they'd <b>realize</b> <b>what</b> they lost when they killed him off in Saw III. But it's been downhill ever since, and we hit bottom today". She admitted that the performances have become [...] "painfully stilted" [...] and called the script [...] "a jumble of nothing punctuated by barely-trying death traps". She went on to say, [...] "It's also disappointing to watch a once-original franchise morph into a generic slasher series, in which random people are killed in banal ways just to up the body count" [...] and closed her review with, [...] "No matter how much money The Final Chapter makes over Halloween weekend, it's time to acknowledge that this game is over".|$|E
