5|$|Cultural {{attitudes towards}} <b>rain</b> differ across the world. In {{temperate}} climates, {{people tend to}} be more stressed when the weather is unstable or cloudy, with its impact greater on men than women. <b>Rain</b> can also bring joy, as some consider it to be soothing or enjoy the aesthetic appeal of it. In dry places, such as India, or during periods of drought, <b>rain</b> lifts people's moods. In Botswana, the Setswana word for <b>rain,</b> pula, is used as the name of the national currency, in recognition of the economic importance of <b>rain</b> in its country, since it has a desert climate. Several cultures have developed means of dealing with <b>rain</b> and have developed numerous protection devices such as umbrellas and raincoats, and diversion devices such as gutters and storm drains that lead rains to sewers. Many people find the scent during and immediately after <b>rain</b> pleasant or distinctive. The source of this scent is petrichor, an oil produced by plants, then absorbed by rocks and soil, and later released into the air during rainfall.|$|E
5|$|In his Balanced Discourse (Lunheng), Wang Chong (27–100 CE) {{wrote that}} some Han thinkers {{believed}} that <b>rain</b> {{fell from the}} Heavens (i.e. where the stars were located). Wang argued that, although <b>rain</b> fell from above, this common theory was false. He agreed with another theory that stated clouds were formed by the evaporation of water on earth, and that since clouds disperse <b>rain,</b> clouds and <b>rain</b> are in fact one and the same; in essence, he accurately described the water cycle.|$|E

5|$|Myers {{made one}} hundred oxy-hydrogen balloon bombs for the {{government}} to do a full scale experiment of producing <b>rain.</b> The balloons were 10, 12, and 20 feet in diameter. The purpose of the Texas experiment was to see if making artificial <b>rain</b> could be done by man-made weather modification. After the experiment took place it was reported that the result was a success of what was hoped for. The news press release of August 20, 1891, reported that <b>rain</b> was made to fall two days before at three o'clock in the afternoon. At the time the sky was clear and there was no prediction of <b>rain</b> in the area for at least a week. The claim was that the <b>rain</b> produced was directly or indirectly caused by the explosion of the oxygen-hydrogen balloon bombs that were exploded electrically at altitudes of 1800 to 3000 feet. That started a sequence of events that lead to a torrent. The <b>rain</b> storm that ensued was reported by ranchers and railroad linemen for some thousand miles across several states. After this Myers was contracted by paper companies in New York state to see about producing <b>rain</b> in their forests that needed it badly. He contended that the Mohawk Valley was {{a good place to start}} <b>rain</b> and that the rainfall then would go to the Adirondack Mountains and Catskill Mountains.|$|E

2500|$|With {{everything}} stage-bound, {{production was}} smooth and problems were few, and small—for instance, Claude <b>Rains,</b> who stood three or four inches shorter than Ingrid Bergman. [...] " [...] this business of you being a midget with a wife, Miss Bergman, who is very tall," [...] the director kidded with <b>Rains,</b> a good friend. For the scenes where <b>Rains</b> and Bergman were to walk hand-in-hand, Hitchcock devised a system of ramps that boosted Rains's height yet were unseen by the camera. He also suggested <b>Rains</b> try elevator shoes: [...] "Walk in them, sleep in them, be comfortable in them." [...] <b>Rains</b> did, and used them thereafter. Hitchcock gave <b>Rains</b> the choice of playing Sebastian with a German or his English accent; <b>Rains</b> chose the latter.|$|R

5|$|Precipitation, {{especially}} <b>rain,</b> has {{a dramatic}} effect on agriculture. All plants {{need at least}} some water to survive, therefore <b>rain</b> (being {{the most effective means}} of watering) is important to agriculture. While a regular <b>rain</b> pattern is usually vital to healthy plants, {{too much or too little}} rainfall can be harmful, even devastating to crops. Drought can kill crops and increase erosion, while overly wet weather can cause harmful fungus growth. Plants need varying amounts of rainfall to survive. For example, certain cacti require small amounts of water, while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of <b>rain</b> per year to survive.|$|E

5|$|Since <b>rain</b> only falls as liquid, in frozen temperatures, <b>rain</b> cannot fall. As a result, {{very cold}} climates see very little {{rainfall}} {{and are often}} known as polar deserts. A common biome {{in this area is}} the tundra which has a short summer thaw and a long frozen winter. Ice caps see no <b>rain</b> at all, making Antarctica the world's driest continent.|$|E

The average annual rainfall recorded at the Tautuku Outdoor Education Centre is about , with little variation from year to year.|$|E

Yellow, green, and black <b>rain</b> was also reported. Coloured <b>rain</b> was also reported in Kerala in 1896 and several times since, most recently in June 2012, and from 15 November 2012 to 27 December 2012 in eastern and north-central provinces of Sri Lanka.|$|E

The content of the conscious belief that it is <b>raining</b> is that is <b>raining</b> and that the believer believes that it is <b>raining...</b>|$|R
50|$|Emory <b>Rains</b> (May 4, 1800 - March 4, 1878) was a lawyer, {{judge and}} {{political}} {{leader in the}} Republic of Texas and thereafter in the State of Texas. <b>Rains</b> was born in Warren County, Tennessee, and moved to Texas in 1817. Emory <b>Rains</b> held many public offices and his life was devoted to public service. <b>Rains</b> was a Member of Texas Republic Senate from the District of Shelby and Sabine (1837-1839); a delegate to the Texas state constitutional convention (1845); {{a member of the}} Texas state house of representatives (1847-1848, 1851-1854); a member of the Texas state senate (1859).

The players returned after 15 minutes and played for approximately half an hour, before Washbrook and Hutton unsuccessfully appealed against the light. <b>Rain</b> then came again for another 40 minutes, which included the tea break.
