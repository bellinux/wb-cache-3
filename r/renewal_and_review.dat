40|$|The present {{research}} study begins addressing {{the lack of}} empirical and systematic research on how students develop singing skills {{in an environment that}} is not the traditional one-to-one learning model. This study provides a conceptual explanation of how students learn singing in a socio-cultural environment by connecting theoretical and methodological considerations to the design of the teaching environment. Socio-cultural theories were incorporated into the design of a singing class environment that encouraged self-regulated learners who learn from social interaction with each other. The study also documents what kinds of strategies students develop as they try and understand the complex act of singing. It provides evidence supporting the theory that students benefit from the type of environment a socio-cultural approach provides. This includes peer interaction, reflection, introduction of scientific concepts concerning the voice and a philosophy of co-construction of learning with the teacher. The research used a qualitative approach, which endeavors to make sense of, understand and interpret the data. To capture the developmental nature of this pedagogical project, and the context in which it was carried out a design-based development research methodology was employed. Central to this approach was the flexibility of the design and capturing social interaction. Teaching strategies underpinned by Vygotsky’s theories of learning, were introduced into the course over a number of years. These strategies were evaluated and a variety of data types were analysed in order to address issues of trustworthiness of data, credibility of interpretation and believability of account. These data types included student and teacher reflective journals, surveys, focus groups and subject and teacher evaluations. The introduction of design-based research methodology into the field of singing offers a means with which other singing researchers can develop models of singing that are grounded in educational theories of learning. Finally educational principles emerged from the study that are transferrable to a similar context and can be used by teachers as part of curriculum <b>renewal</b> <b>and</b> <b>review...</b>|$|E

To facilitate implementation of the License <b>Renewal</b> Rule <b>and</b> the <b>review</b> of license renewal applications (LRAs), the U. S.

The staff, industry, and stakeholders gain experience and develop lessons learned with each renewed license. Through use of the license renewal guidance documents, the staff, industry, or stakeholders may discover areas for improvement or that warrant new guidance. The staff developed a process to capture and communicate interim guidance for new insights, lessons learned, and emergent issues to create a license renewal program that progressively improves.

Thus, an application should establish the necessary basis to enable the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff to make a finding {{that the effects of}} aging on dry cask storage SSCs are understood and will be managed such that the ISFSI can be operated during the renewal period without undue risk to {{the health and safety of}} the public. License renewal is not an exercise in re-licensing and is not intended to impose requirements beyond those that were met by the facility when it was initially licensed by the NRC. Therefore, the current licensing basis (CLB) for the ISFSI will be carried forward through the renewal period. The renewal period for a Part 72 license shall not exceed 20 years, unless a specific exemption is requested and granted by the staff. This document is intended to serve as preliminary guidance for use by NRC staff in the review of license renewal applications for spent fuel dry cask storage facilities holding a site-specific license under 10 CFR Part 72.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to review the Labour government policy of Civil Renewal in its Civic Pioneer guise. It will be achieved by using Plymouth as a case study and establishing {{the extent to which the}} City Council has and will incorporate this ethos, by exploring and identifying what needs developing' in terms of Civic Pioneer activity. Plymouth is one of twenty four towns and cities from across the country to sign up to the Civic Pioneers initiative. Civic Pioneers as a concept was developed by the Home Office's Civil Renewal Unit in partnership with the Local Government Association and the Society for Local Authority Chief Executives with the aim of cultivating local authority exemplars of Civil Renewal. A civic pioneer is: 'A local Authority committed to engaging communities in the design and delivery of services as part of the wider civil renewal agenda'. (Riaz, Patel. 2004. p 6). 'A local authonty committed to the ethos of community engagement, regarding participatory democracy not as a threat to or substitutes for, but a vital complement to representative democracy, (www. newstartmag. co. uk. 2004. p 1.) To determine the themes of investigation I conducted three participant observations then explored them further by conducting twenty interviews with stakeholders in Plymouth who are primarily included in the policy process; further secondary analysis has enabled the findings to be reviewed in context with the relevant literature. This dissertation is in two parts sub-divided into six chapters. Part One examines the background to the Civic Pioneer initiative and the operationalization of {{this research}}. Chapter 1 asks, why the need for Civil Renewal? It examines the ethos of Civil <b>Renewal</b> <b>and</b> <b>reviews</b> Civil <b>Renewal</b> in practice, specifically Plymouth's Civic Pioneer status. Chapter 2 is a <b>review</b> <b>and</b> discussion of the methodology utilised in this project, including a reflexive account. Part Two, the major part of this dissertation, presents the research findings and recommendations of the observations and interviews which are analysed in the context of key literature. The three themes identified by the participant observations and then explored further by interviews and secondary analyses are: 1. The Message (Chapter 3) : This identifies understanding and awareness of the Civic Pioneer initiative is not reaching enough stakeholders but is satisfactorily permeating institutionally. It highlights possible solutions which are inextricably linked to the reform of policy evaluation and community engagement. 2. Policy Evaluation (Chapter 4) : This examines the confusion surrounding Civic Pioneer policy evaluation. Civic Pioneers heralds a move away from the purely managerial approach to policy evaluation. It's a shift to a position where less quantifiable development such as building confidence and quality of life issues are factored in by professionals and stakeholders alike to the evaluation process. 3. Community Engagement (Chapter 5) : This looks at the issue of trust between Plymouth City Council and its stakeholders. Effective community engagement is achieved through creating and developing effective channels of communication. Although designed as a bottom up initiative, providing guidance for policy evaluation, building on existing channels of community engagement and engaging hard to reach groups is nonetheless necessary. Finally, In Chapter 6 I present the summary and conclusions. In terms of this research two issues stand out in particular. First, the need and desirability of a non-prescriptive Civic Pioneer tool kit to clear up any confusion and offer guidance for all the facets of the Civil Renewal agenda per se, and second, qualitative policy evaluation methods such as soft outcomes and distance travelled should be used when ever appropriate...|$|R
