The house's main door opens into a square vaulted vestibule, walled throughout with highly polished yellow marble. It leads into the main hall, which is paneled to the ceiling in wood, painted white, the corners and angles accentuated by pilasters, and the rich mahogany doors encased within monumental frames. The white ceiling is intricately coffered. The hall has a large fireplace of carved white marble and a large table in the room's center, which was on a large red rug covering most of the floor. The main hall also featured Gobelins and Italian tapestries. The first floor also has an enfilade of three rooms: the green silk- and cedar-paneled living <b>room,</b> <b>the</b> white and gold drawing room, and the dark mahogany dining <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> three rooms have large doorways between them to allow hosts to combine rooms for a large event. The combined space has a span or linear distance of about 150 feet. A corridor connects the main hall to three rooms; it has recessed windows, dividing the corridor into bays. The corridor has pilasters and the same coffered ceiling of the main hall, and it used to have heavy velvet curtains at the window alcoves and entrance to the hallway; the windows had curtains of delicate salmon silk.

5|$|In April 2002, Specht Properties was {{selected}} as the developer of the project after scoring higher with the council appointed committee formed to rate each of three developer's proposals, with Gerding/Edlen Development and Trammell Crow Company losing out to Specht. Construction on the complex began in June 2003 when an old grain store at the site was demolished {{to make room for the}} center.

5000|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>room</b> on <b>the</b> {{northwest}} corner {{was more likely}} to be viewed by guests when the house was built, it too was designed with more ornate woodwork, but the mantle does not contain as many decorations as <b>the</b> parlor <b>room</b> does. As <b>the</b> house has been passed down through the Lacy family, only females have stayed in this <b>room,</b> so <b>the</b> family simply calls it [...] "the girls' room." [...] <b>The</b> <b>room</b> on <b>the</b> southeast corner is known as [...] "the boys' room" [...] and is not decorated as extensively as <b>the</b> front two <b>rooms.</b> <b>The</b> master bedroom is in the southwest corner and contains three doors to access the parlor, the central hallway, and <b>the</b> kitchen/dining <b>room,</b> although <b>the</b> latter would have led directly outside before <b>the</b> kitchen/dining <b>room</b> was added.|$|R
