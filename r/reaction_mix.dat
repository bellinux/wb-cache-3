40|$|Abstract Mass {{transfer}} {{between the}} liquid and solid {{phases of the}} <b>reaction</b> <b>mix</b> during the metakaolin crystallization into the powdered Zeolite LTA has been studied. The metakaolin crystallization {{has been shown to}} occur through the formation stage of the amorphous sodium aluminosilicate close by its composition to the Zeolite LTA (Linde type A). It has been established that during thermochemical processing of the metakaolin in aqueous sodium hydroxide solution the solid-liquid mass transfer occurred already at 30 o C on account of the interaction of the metakaolin with polyhydroxy complexes of sodium. The stage rate grows as the temperature is elevated, and the sodium hydroxide concentration in the liquid phase of the <b>reaction</b> <b>mix</b> increased.

40|$|Colloidal silica {{particles}} {{have found}} {{a wide variety of}} applications including uses in chemical analysis, catalyst, sensor and bio-medicinal fields. Current industrial production of silica, however,relies on high temperatures or harsh conditions. Bioinspired synthesis routes provide a way to circumvent these issues as well as possibly enhancing the control of particle formation beyond what is currently possible with commercial methods. Previous work has demonstrated monodisperse "PEIsilica" particles can be synthesized from non-toxic hydrolysed trimethoxymethylsilane (TMOMS) and the biomimetic catalyst polyethyleneimine (PEI) through a polymerisation condensation proceeding at room temperature. In this work the role of mixing (through magnetic stirring and sonication during the reaction period) on final particle size and morphology was investigated. No <b>mixing</b> <b>reactions,</b> <b>mixing</b> by sonication and mixing by magnetic stirring were chosen as the three preparation modes. The results of the no <b>mixing</b> <b>reactions</b> showed that the particle polydispersity as well as their average size was sensitive to the location of precursor injection. Mixing by sonication broadened the particle size distribution compared to no <b>mixing</b> <b>reactions.</b> Finally, in the magnetic stirring experiments, the rate of stirring could increase or decrease the final particle size, depending on the concentration of PEI. Overall, determining the relationship between the desired characteristics of the particles and the <b>reaction</b> <b>mixing</b> conditions is extremely beneficial for the optimisation of the particle synthesis process, especially when considering silica particle applications that require control of specific interactions, such as in mineral separation, catalysis and drug delivery...|$|R

40|$|Translation of poliovirion RNA in HeLa S 10 {{extracts}} {{resulted in}} the formation of RNA replication complexes which catalyzed the asymmetric replication of poliovirus RNA. Synthesis of poliovirus RNA was detected in unfractionated HeLa S 10 translation reactions and in RNA replication complexes isolated from HeLa S 10 translation reactions by pulse-labeling with [32 P]CTP. The RNA replication complexes formed in vitro contained replicative-intermediate RNA and were enriched in viral protein 3 CD and the membrane-associated viral proteins 2 C, 2 BC, and 3 AB. Genome-length poliovirus RNA covalently linked to VPg was synthesized in large amounts by the replication complexes. RNA replication was highly asymmetric, with predominantly positive-polarity RNA products. Both anti-VPg antibody and guanidine HCl inhibited RNA replication and virus formation in the HeLa S 10 translation reactions without affecting viral protein synthesis. The inhibition of RNA synthesis by guanidine was reversible. The reversible nature of guanidine inhibition was used to demonstrate the formation of preinitiation RNA replication complexes in <b>reaction</b> <b>mixes</b> containing 2 mM guanidine HCl. Preinitiation complexes sedimented upon centrifugation at 15, 000 x g and initiated RNA replication upon their resuspension in <b>reaction</b> <b>mixes</b> lacking guanidine. Initiation of RNA synthesis by preinitiation complexes did not require active protein synthesis or the addition of soluble viral proteins. Initiation of RNA synthesis by preinitiation complexes, however, was absolutely dependent on soluble HeLa cytoplasmic factors. Preinitiation complexes also catalyzed the formation of infectious virus in <b>reaction</b> <b>mixes</b> containing exogenously added capsid proteins. The titer of infectious virus produced in such trans-encapsidation reactions reached 4 x 10 (7) PFU/ml. The HeLa S 10 translation-RNA replication reactions represent an efficient in vitro system for authentic poliovirus replication, including protein synthesis, polyprotein processing, RNA replication, and virus assembly...|$|R
