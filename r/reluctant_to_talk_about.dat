40|$|Thesis (MPhil (Industrial Psychology. HIV/AIDS Management)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. “I know my body, HIV/AIDS {{will never}} happen to me. ” Many people {{especially}} young-adults (15 - 39) have a low risk perception, information and knowledge {{when it comes to}} sexual activity and STIs. They think that they are infallible and that misfortune –like contracting HIV-only happens to someone else. In many countries and cultures where secrecy and shame surround the subject, sex is a social taboo. In Cameroon, for example, traditionally the uncle gives sex education for boys and by the aunt for girls. However, in current times extended families do not often live together, so the traditional way of giving sex education become more difficult. The government has tried to solve this vacuum by designing an AIDS education programme, which should be implemented in primary and secondary schools. However, most teachers are too ashamed <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with their pupils about these sensitive matters and the pupils are too afraid to ask sensitive questions. Preventing HIV/AIDS among young-adults in Sub Sahara Africa especially in Cameroon is critical as many are at significant risk for HIV infection. Peer education actually stands to be one strategy for both HIV/AIDS prevention and sexual health promotion for this population. It builds on the strong ties between age-mates fostered during socialization and bypasses adults who are <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> youth <b>about</b> sexual matters. Therefore, this research paper will focus specially on the HIV prevention programme; the peer education approach set up on young-adults people in Cameroon; when trying to ascertain whether it can play a significant and constructive role in the fight against HIV/AIDS in the Douala community and in the large extend the whole country...|$|R

2500|$|Following Obama's election, many {{pondered the}} {{existence}} of a [...] "postracial America." [...] However, lingering racial tensions quickly became apparent, and many African-Americans expressed outrage over what they saw as [...] "racial venom" [...] directed at Obama's presidency. In July 2009, prominent African-American Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr., was arrested at his Cambridge, Massachusetts home by a local police officer, sparking a controversy after Obama stated that the police acted [...] "stupidly" [...] in handling the incident. To reduce tensions, Obama invited Gates and the police officer to the White House in {{what became known as the}} [...] "Beer Summit". Several other incidents during Obama's presidency sparked outrage in the African-American community and/or the law enforcement community, and Obama sought to build trust between law enforcement officials and civil rights activists. The acquittal of George Zimmerman following the shooting of Trayvon Martin sparked national outrage, leading to Obama giving a speech in which he noted that [...] "Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago." [...] The shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri sparked a wave of protests. These and other events led to the birth of the Black Lives Matter movement, which campaigns against violence and systemic racism toward black people. Some in the law enforcement community criticized Obama's condemnation of racial bias after incidents in which police action led to the death of African-American men, while some racial justice activists criticized Obama's expressions of empathy for the police. Though Obama entered office <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> race, by 2014 he began openly discussing the disadvantages faced by many members of minority groups.

This paper reports the causes of reticence among EFL students at Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Iran. 190 students were randomly selected (2010) and were studies for their reticence reasons. To measure student's general tendency to avoid spoken communication, the 20 -item Unwillingness to Communicate Scale (UCS) was used, which measures two dimensions of reticence: Approach Avoidance (AA) and Reward (R). Using a Likert scale, the obtained data were analyzed in SPSS {{and the results were}} reported using descriptive statistics. Based on the statistical analyses, we concluded that the participants were aware of the value of oral communication in the classrooms, and those who regarded themselves as more proficient in English were more cooperative and willing <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> and get into discussions in the classrooms.

40|$|Background. A {{culture of}} {{stringent}} drug policy, one-size-fits-all treatment approaches, and drug-related stigma has clouded clinical HIV {{practice in the}} United States. The result {{is a series of}} missed opportunities in the HIV care environment. An approach which may address the broken relationship between patient and provider is harm reduction—which removes judgment and operates at the patient’s stage of readiness. Harm reduction is not a routine part of care; rather, it exists outside clinic walls, exacerbating the divide between compassionate, stigma-free services and the medical system. Methods. Qualitative, phenomenological, semi-structured, individual interviews with patients and providers were conducted in three publicly-funded clinics in Chicago, located in areas of high HIV prevalence and drug use and serving African-American patients (N = 38). A deductive thematic analysis guided the process, including: the creation of an index code list, transcription and verification of interviews, manual coding, notation of emerging themes and refinement of code definitions, two more rounds of coding within AtlasTi, calculation of Cohen’s Kappa for interrater reliability, queries of major codes and analysis of additional common themes. Results. Thematic analysis of findings indicated that the majority of patients felt receptive to harm reduction interventions (safer injection counseling, safer stimulant use counseling, overdose prevention information, supply provision) from their provider, and expressed anticipated gratitude for harm reduction information and/or supplies within the HIV care visit, although some were <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> openly <b>about</b> their drug use. Provider results were mixed, with more receptivity reported by advanced practice nurses, and more barriers cited by physicians. Notable barriers included: role-perceptions, limited time, inadequate training, and the patients themselves. Discussion. Patients are willing to receive harm reduction interventions from their HIV care providers, while provider receptiveness is mixed. The findings reveal critical implications for diffusion of harm reduction into HIV care, including the need to address cited barriers for both patients and providers to ensure feasibility of implementation. Strategies to address these barriers are discussed, and recommendations for further research are also shared...|$|R
40|$|Abortion is {{a common}} {{experience}} among U. S. women. 1 Nev-ertheless, because abortion is a sensitive topic for many peo-ple, it is commonly underreported in national surveys, 2 and representative information about women who have abortions is limited. Most states and the District of Columbia collect data {{on the characteristics of}} women who have abortions as part of their vital statistics systems; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tabulates and publishes these data in summary form. 3 However, this information is limit-ed to a few basic demographic characteristics. Accurate national information describing women who have abortions may dispel, or confirm, stereotypes that arise when people are <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> openly <b>about</b> their abor-tion experiences. In addition, given that abortion rates de-creased throughout the 1990 s, 4 identifying the groups of women in which the decrease was below average or in which no decrease occurred can help policymakers and family planning providers determine which groups of women at which point in their lives need greater assistance prevent-ing unintended pregnancies. To obtain a more comprehensive and nationally repre-sentative overview of abortion, The Alan Guttmacher In-stitute (AGI) conducted a national survey of U. S. women having abortions in 2000 – 2001. In this article, we present information from the survey on the social and demographic characteristics of women who had abortions. We also pre-sent abortion rates and ratios for subgroups of women for the year 2000, combining data from the AGI survey of women having abortions with data on the number of abor-tions from the 2001 – 2002 AGI Abortion Provider Survey. 5 Our analysis explores whether the decline in the national abortion rate between 1994 and 2000 occurred across all subgroups of women or was concentrated in certain sub-groups. We conclude by discussing variations in abortion rates within the context of larger social and economic de-velopments that may have affected women’s childbearing decisions and access to contraceptive services. METHODS This survey of abortion patients is AGI’s third in a series, and uses a design and questionnaire similar to those for the two earlier studies, which were conducted in 19876 an...|$|R
