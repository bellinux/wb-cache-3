The North Koreans, <b>racked</b> by logistical and manpower shortages, focused more heavily on their attacks against 24th Infantry positions on Battle Mountain, as well as 35th Infantry positions at the Nam River. 24th Infantry troops at Haman encountered only probing attacks until September 18.|$|E

The West Indies <b>racked</b> up 448/9 despite no batsman reaching a century.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>RACK</b> 1 is a {{versatile}} scaffold protein in mammals, regulating diverse developmental processes. Unlike in non-plant organisms where <b>RACK</b> 1 is encoded {{by a single}} gene, Arabidopsis genome contains three <b>RACK</b> 1 homologous genes, designated as <b>RACK</b> 1 A, <b>RACK</b> 1 B and <b>RACK</b> 1 C, respectively. Previous studies indicated that the loss-of-function alleles of <b>RACK</b> 1 A displayed multiple defects in plant development. However, the functions of <b>RACK</b> 1 B and <b>RACK</b> 1 C remain elusive. Further, the relationships between three <b>RACK</b> 1 homologous genes are unknown. Results We isolated mutant alleles with loss-of-function mutations in <b>RACK</b> 1 B and <b>RACK</b> 1 C, and examined {{the impact of these}} mutations on plant development. We found that unlike in <b>RACK</b> 1 A, loss-of-function mutations in <b>RACK</b> 1 B or <b>RACK</b> 1 C do not confer apparent defects in plant development, including rosette leaf production and root development. Analyses of <b>rack</b> 1 a, <b>rack</b> 1 b and <b>rack</b> 1 c double and triple mutants, however, revealed that <b>rack</b> 1 b and <b>rack</b> 1 c can enhance the <b>rack</b> 1 a mutant's developmental defects, and an extreme developmental defect and lethality were observed in <b>rack</b> 1 a <b>rack</b> 1 b <b>rack</b> 1 c triple mutant. Complementation studies indicated that <b>RACK</b> 1 B and <b>RACK</b> 1 C are in principle functionally equivalent to <b>RACK</b> 1 A. Gene expression studies indicated that three <b>RACK</b> 1 genes display similar expression patterns but are expressed at different levels. Further, <b>RACK</b> 1 genes positively regulate each other's expression. Conclusion These results suggested that <b>RACK</b> 1 genes are critical regulators of plant development and that <b>RACK</b> 1 genes function in an unequally redundant manner. Both the difference in <b>RACK</b> 1 gene expression level and the cross-regulation are likely the molecular determinants of their unequal genetic redundancy. </p...|$|R

5|$|After a long {{struggle}} which threatened {{to ruin the}} Communist League, Marx's opinion prevailed and eventually the Willich/Schapper group left the Communist League. Meanwhile, Marx also became heavily involved with the socialist German Workers' Educational Society.

This organisation was also <b>racked</b> by an internal struggle between its members, some of whom followed Marx while others followed the Schapper/Willich faction. The issues in this internal split were the same issues raised in the internal split within the Communist League, but Marx lost the fight with the Schapper/Willich faction within the German Workers' Educational Society and on 17 September 1850 resigned from the Society.|$|E
