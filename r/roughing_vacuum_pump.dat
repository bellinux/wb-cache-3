While the facility is designed to handle radioactive materials, {{the location of the}} {sup 65 }Zn was in an area that is not designed for gamma emitting contaminants. A series of experiments were conducted to entrain the contaminant in an easily replaceable trap within the process piping. The experiments were conducted with increasing levels of complexity. Initially a simple apparatus was developed to determine the effect of substrate temperature on the vapor capture, this was followed by experiments to determine the effect of filter pore size on pumping and trapping, finally the interactive effects of both pore size and temperature were evaluated. The testing was conducted on a system that used a <b>roughing</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> using model and prototypic materials. It was determined that heating the substrate to nominally 200 °C resulted in effective trapping on the model as well as prototypic material...|$|E

50|$|Positive {{displacement}} pumps {{are the most}} effective for low <b>vacuums.</b> Momentum transfer <b>pumps</b> in conjunction {{with one or two}} positive {{displacement pumps}} are the most common configuration used to achieve high vacuums. In this configuration the positive displacement pump serves two purposes. First it obtains a <b>rough</b> <b>vacuum</b> in the vessel being evacuated before the momentum transfer pump can be used to obtain the high vacuum, as momentum transfer pumps cannot start pumping at atmospheric pressures. Second the positive displacement pump backs up the momentum transfer pump by evacuating to low vacuum the accumulation of displaced molecules in the high <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump.</b> Entrapment pumps can be added to reach ultrahigh vacuums, but they require periodic regeneration of the surfaces that trap air molecules or ions. Due to this requirement their available operational time can be unacceptably short in low and high vacuums, thus limiting their use to ultrahigh <b>vacuums.</b> <b>Pumps</b> also differ in details like manufacturing tolerances, sealing material, pressure, flow, admission or no admission of oil vapor, service intervals, reliability, tolerance to dust, tolerance to chemicals, tolerance to liquids and vibration.|$|R
40|$|Micromachined <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are one of}} the key {{components}} in miniature systems for chemical and biological analysis. Miniature sensors and analyzers are normally operated at the pressure range lower than a few millitorr. We are developing a micromachined <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> that is comprised of a mechanical rough pump integrated with micromachined ion-pumps. The rough pump generates a low vacuum of tens of torr from atmospheric pressure for the ion-pumps to initialize. Field ionization and electron impact ionization pumps that connect to the rough pumps continue to pump from the low vacuum of tens of torr to high vacuum of millitorr or even microtorr. The focus of this thesis work is {{on the development of the}} micromachined rough pump. A micromachined displacement pump concept is adopted for the development of the chip scale <b>vacuum</b> <b>rough</b> <b>pump.</b> The micro displacement pump is designed with the aid of analytical and numerical modeling. The rough pump is fabricated by deep-reactive ion etching and other standard micromachining techniques. Systematic study into operation of this class of pumps allows us to now report on a pump that achieves 164 torr absolute pressure, which is to our knowledge the lowest measured pressure in a micromachined <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> operated from atmospheric pressure. This performance improvement is significant in that it enables a base pressure of less than 35 torr for a two-stage design, which allows integration with the ion pump, thus leading to realization of miniature chemical and biological analyzers. More importantly, the understanding of the micromachined displacement <b>pumps</b> for <b>vacuum</b> generation has been greatly improved and a universal model has been developed, which is very powerful to describe and predict the micromachined displacement <b>pump</b> behavior for <b>vacuum</b> generation. by Hui Zhou.

40|$|ABSTRACT Â <b>Vacuum</b> <b>pumps</b> {{have been}} {{described}} as compressors for rarefied gases. Â For more than twenty-five years the scroll compressor principle has been used in designing <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumps</b> that do not rely on oil to provide their pumping action. Â The dry scroll <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> has been particularly successful as a source of <b>rough</b> <b>vacuum</b> for analytical instruments such as liquid-chromatography or gas-chromatography mass spectrometers. Â Such instruments are typically located in quiet laboratory environments where the scroll <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> may be the only significant source of noise. Â Consequently, quiet operation is a key requirement of dry scroll <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumps.</b> Â This paper discusses an occurrence of stick-slip squeal that developed during the design of a new model, low noise, dry scroll pump. Â Stick-slip phenomena and the associated noise are the result ofÂ 2 ̆ 2 self-excited 2 ̆ 2 oscillations related to the difference between static and sliding friction. Â Rapidly oscillating friction forces occurring during a portion of the orbital cycle can result in induced vibration of the participating surfaces and structure, which radiate high-pitched noise. Â In the case described, considerable effort was expended in developing a design that would be quiet in comparison with other models in the marketplace. Â The occurrence of a loud 2 ̆ 2 chirping 2 ̆ 2 noise, determined to be due to a stick-slip behavior, in a late stage prototype, caused a good deal of concern and a flurry of activity to fully characterize the vibration behavior within the pump related to the noise and to develop design modifications to ensure that the noise was eliminated. Â The characteristics of the noise are described for the scroll pump along with the methods utilized to eliminate it from the design...|$|R

25|$|The {{vacuum system}} for {{evacuating}} a TEM to an operating pressure level consists of several stages. Initially, a low or <b>roughing</b> <b>vacuum</b> is achieved {{with either a}} rotary vane pump or diaphragm pumps setting a sufficiently low pressure to allow the operation of a turbo-molecular or diffusion <b>pump</b> establishing high <b>vacuum</b> level necessary for operations. To allow for the low <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> to not require continuous operation, while continually operating the turbo-molecular <b>pumps,</b> the <b>vacuum</b> side of a low-pressure pump may be connected to chambers which accommodate the exhaust gases from the turbo-molecular pump. Sections of the TEM may be isolated {{by the use of}} pressure-limiting apertures to allow for different vacuum levels in specific areas such as a higher vacuum of 10−4 to 10−7 Pa or higher in the electron gun in high-resolution or field-emission TEMs.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vacuum</b> <b>pumps</b> are {{combined}} with chambers and operational procedures {{into a wide}} variety of vacuum systems. Sometimes more than one pump will be used (in series or in parallel) in a single application. A partial <b>vacuum,</b> or <b>rough</b> <b>vacuum,</b> can be created using a positive displacement pump that transports a gas load from an inlet port to an outlet (exhaust) port. Because of their mechanical limitations, such pumps can only achieve a low vacuum. To achieve a higher vacuum, other techniques must then be used, typically in series (usually following an initial fast pump down with a positive displacement pump). Some examples might be use of an oil sealed rotary vane pump (the most common positive displacement pump) backing a diffusion pump, or a dry scroll pump backing a turbomolecular pump. There are other combinations depending on the level of vacuum being sought.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the results of}} a project funded by Regione Toscana aimed at {{reducing}} the power absorption of auxiliary devices in vehicles are presented. In particular the design, testing and application of a magnetorheological clutch (MR) is proposed, aimed at disengaging the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump,</b> which draws in air from the power-brake booster chamber, {{in order to reduce the}} device power absorption. Several clutch preliminary studies done to choose the clutch geometry and the magnetic field supply are illustrated. The final choice consisted in an MR clutch with permanent magnet, which satisfied size, torque and fail-safe specifications. The clutch characteristics, in terms of torque versus slip, were obtained experimentally for three different clutch prototypes on an ad-hoc developed test bench. As result of a preliminary simulation, a comparison between the power absorption of a current production <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump,</b> an innovative <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> and both <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumps</b> coupled with the MR clutch is presented. The New European Driving Cycle is considered for simulating the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> operation both in urban and highway driving. Results show that the use of the innovative <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> reduces the device consumption of about 35 %, whereas the use of MR clutch coupled with the innovative <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> reduces it up to about 44 % in urban driving and 50 % in highway driving...|$|R
