One hundred and twenty five lambs of Churra Galega Braganc ̧ana breed were slaugh- tered. During carcasses quartering, a caliper was used to perform subcutaneous fat measurements, over the max- imum depth of longissimus muscle (LM), between the 12 th and 13 th ribs (C 12), and between the 1 st and 2 nd lumbar vertebrae (C 1). The Muscle (MP), Bone (BP), Subcutaneous Fat (SFP), Inter-Muscular Fat (IFP), and Kidney Knob and Channel Fat (KKCF) proportions of lamb carcasses were computed.

This principle is of extreme value for the study of our understanding of mathematical self-similarity in both of its typical presentations: <b>relative</b> or <b>absolute.</b> <b>For</b> the first case, abduction incarnates the quantitative/qualitative relationships of a self-similar object or process; for the second case, abduction makes understandable the statistical treatment of self-similarity, 'guessing' the continuity of geometric features to the infinity {{through the use of a}} systematic stereotype (for instance, the assumption that the general shape of the Sierpiński triangle continuates identically into its particular shapes). The metaphor coined by Peirce, of an exact map containig itself the same exact map (a map of itself), is not only the most important precedent of Mandelbrot’s problem of measuring the boundaries of a continuous irregular surface with a logarithmic ruler, but also still being a useful abstraction for the conceptualisation of <b>relative</b> and <b>absolute</b> self-similarity, and its mechanisms of implementation.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that concentrations of several biomarkers in diabetics' breath show significant difference from those in healthy people's breath. Concentrations of some biomarkers are also correlated with the blood glucose levels (BGLs) of diabetics. Therefore, it is possible to screen for diabetes and predict BGLs by analyzing one's breath. In this paper, we describe the design of a novel breath analysis system for this purpose. The system uses carefully selected chemical sensors to detect biomarkers in breath. Common interferential factors, including humidity and the ratio of alveolar air in breath, are compensated or handled in the algorithm. Considering the intersubject variance of the components in breath, we build subject-specific prediction models to improve the accuracy of BGL prediction. A total of 295 breath samples from healthy subjects and 279 samples from diabetic subjects were collected to evaluate the performance of the system. The sensitivity and specificity of diabetes screening are 91. 51 % and 90. 77 %, respectively. The mean <b>relative</b> <b>absolute</b> error <b>for</b> BGL prediction is 21. 7 %. Experiments show that the system is effective and that the strategies adopted in the system can improve its accuracy.

40|$|Housekeeping {{genes are}} often used as {{references}} when quantifying the relative abundance of transcripts of interest, because {{it is assumed that}} they are stably expressed across tissues and developmental stages. Standard housekeeping genes are targeted particularly in organisms where there is no detailed information on gene expression profiles. Here, the validity of using the two widely accepted housekeeping genes, 18 S rRNA and beta-actin, as reference genes to normalize real-time RT-PCR gene expression data from the Kuruma shrimp, Marsupenaeus japonicus, was tested. Expression patterns of two target genes in a diverse sample set of embryonic, larval, post-larval and gonad mRNAs were quantified using <b>relative</b> and <b>absolute</b> real-time RT-PCR procedures. Comparison of these approaches revealed significant differences (P < 0. 0001) in transcript level profiles between the <b>relative</b> and <b>absolute</b> procedures <b>for</b> both target genes. When 18 S rRNA was used as a reference, target gene expression was more {{similar to that of the}} absolute method than when beta-actin was used as a reference. Variability between the <b>relative</b> and <b>absolute</b> procedures occurred <b>for</b> a greater percentage of the embryonic stages compared to later developmental stages. This study indicates that the use of 18 S rRNA and beta-actin for studying relative gene expression patterns in Kuruma shrimp embryonic, larval, post-larval and gonad samples will give significantly variable results, and illustrates the proposition that housekeeping genes are not necessarily appropriate references for real-time RT-PCR data normalization. Until suitable reference genes are characterized, gene expression experiments using the studied Kuruma shrimp tissues of different morphological developmental stages should use absolute quantification procedures.

These improvements may, however, mask considerable disparities between subnational populations. In this paper, we examine the extent of the country’s child mortality inequalities.

Disparities were measured on both <b>absolute</b> and <b>relative</b> scales using rate differences and ratios, and where applicable, slope and relative indices of inequality by levels of rural/urban location, regions and household wealth. Findings: Since 2000, considerable reductions in under-five and to a lesser extent in neonatal mortality rates have been observed.

The objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate the ability of the CLIGEN model to reproduce daily, monthly, and annual precipitation amounts, extremes, and internal storm patterns (i. e., storm duration, relative peak intensity, and time to peak) and to assess further the impact of generated storm patterns on WEPP runoff and erosion prediction. Four Oklahoma stations with more than 50 years of daily precipitation data and eight other sites across the U. S. with an average record of 10 years of measured storm patterns were used. Mean <b>absolute</b> <b>relative</b> errors <b>for</b> simulating daily, monthly, and annual precipitation across the four Oklahoma stations were 4. 7 %, 1. 7 %, and 1. 5 % for the means and 3. 7 %, 6. 7 %, and 15 % for the standard deviations, respectively. Mean <b>absolute</b> <b>relative</b> errors <b>for</b> the all–time maxima of daily, monthly, and yearly precipitation were 17. 7 %, 8. 9 %, and 6. 5 %, respectively. Storm pattern generation, especially storm duration, was determined to need improvement for better prediction of runoff and soil erosion. The measured storm patterns showed positive linear correlations between precipitation, duration, and relative peak intensity, but little correlation was shown for generated storm patterns. The CLIGEN–generated durations were generally too long for small storms and too short for large storms. Inaccurate storm pattern generation led to WEPP prediction errors as high as 35 % for average annual runoff and 47 % for annual sediment yield on the test sites. To improve WEPP runoff and erosion prediction, storm duration generation should be reconsidered, and a distribution–free approach may be used to induce proper correlations between the input storm variables...|$|R

Paired t-tests and case-crossover analyses were performed to assess the relationship between heatwaves and health outcomes using different heatwave definitions.

The usual {{approach}} for flood damage assessment consists of stage-damage functions which relate the <b>relative</b> or <b>absolute</b> damage <b>for</b> a certain {{class of objects}} to the in-undation depth. Other characteristics of the flooding situa-tion and of the flooded object are rarely taken into account, although flood damage is influenced {{by a variety of}} fac-tors. We apply a group of data-mining techniques, known as tree-structured models, to flood damage assessment. A very comprehensive data set of more than 1000 records of direct building damage of private households in Germany is used. Each record contains details about a large variety of poten-tial damage-influencing characteristics, such as hydrological and hydraulic aspects of the flooding situation, early warning and emergency measures undertaken, state of precaution of the household, building characteristics and socio-economic status of the household. Regression trees and bagging de-cision trees are used to select the more important damage-influencing variables and to derive multi-variate flood dam-age models. It is shown that these models outperform exist-ing models, and that tree-structured models are a promising alternative to traditional damage models. ...|$|R
