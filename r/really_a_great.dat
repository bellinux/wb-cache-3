But what people didn't realise at that time, that she really knew, and in fact I didn't even know it when we were making the record, and now looking at the whole thing; she knew that she was in a lot of trouble; that she wasn't going to live. And it wasn't drugs. It was alcohol toward the end... It was such a sad thing because... she was the only singer that really sang what I call the 'right way' because she was a great jazz-pop singer... She was <b>really</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> jazz singer. A true jazz singer. And I regret that because that's the 'right way' to sing.|$|E
500|$|The {{anonymous}} {{narrator is}} at first sceptical, then believing, finally flirtatious with the reader: {{he concludes that}} [...] "there is <b>really</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal to {{be said of the}} Willie Hughes theory of Shakespeare's sonnets." [...] By the end fact and fiction have melded together. Arthur Ransome wrote that Wilde [...] "read something of himself into Shakespeare's sonnets" [...] and became fascinated with the [...] "Willie Hughes theory" [...] despite the lack of biographical evidence for the historical William Hughes' existence. Instead of writing a short but serious essay on the question, Wilde tossed the theory amongst the three characters of the story, allowing it to unfold as background to the plot. The story thus is an early masterpiece of Wilde's combing many elements that interested him, conversation, literature and the idea that to shed oneself of an idea one must first convince another of its truth. Ransome concludes that Wilde succeeds precisely because the literary criticism is unveiled with such a deft touch.|$|E

500|$|In March 1948 Horne {{appeared}} with Murdoch in six episodes of the BBC Television comedy series Kaleidoscope. In June that year he and Murdoch again appeared {{on television in}} a one-off sitcom, At Home, which they wrote. The following year Horne began his connection with Twenty Questions, an association that lasted, on-and-off, for 20 years. By the fourth series of Much-Binding in 1950, the listener figures had declined to a level that concerned the BBC and they decided against a fifth series. Rather than {{wait to see what}} other offers of work would come in from the Corporation, Horne and Murdoch signed the comedy to a 35-programme series on Radio Luxembourg between October 1950 and June 1951. The programme was poorly received on the commercial channel: Murdoch observed that [...] "it wasn't <b>really</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> success—even my mother said it was rotten, and she was my greatest fan". After one series, the show returned to the BBC in 1951–52, although renamed as Over to You. Murdoch and Horne again appeared together, in April 1952, on Desert Island Discs.|$|E
500|$|On September 27, 1979, Yankovic {{received}} a type-written note from Dr. Demento informing him that [...] "My Bologna" [...] was a smash hit {{on his radio}} show, and that Capitol Records had contacted the station, requesting {{a copy of the}} spoof for The Knack themselves. Later, The Knack performed at Cal Poly, and Yankovic managed to approach the band and Rupert Perry (then-vice president of Capitol Records) backstage. He informed them of who he was, and, according to Yankovic, [...] " [...] Doug Fieger [...] said 'Oh, [...] a <b>really</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> song!' and then he turned to Rupert Perry and said 'You guys oughta put this song out on Capitol Records' and Rupert said 'OK, let's do it!'" [...] Yankovic was paid $500 for the song's master, as well as the master for the soon-to-be b-side track [...] "School Cafeteria". The [...] "My Bologna" [...] single was released on Christmas Day, 1979 (a month after The Knack's concert at Cal Poly) and Yankovic was given a six-month contract.|$|E
500|$|Several of Artie's scenes {{came in for}} criticism. The {{scene where}} he advised Rachel and Blaine to have sex was viewed by Poniewozik as [...] "a forced {{conflict}} designed to drive the plot" [...] and highly implausible {{for a number of}} reasons. Kubicek stated that [...] "acting is about pretending, and if Rachel is <b>really</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> actress, she'd be able to play the emotion without needing to have sex". Bell and West made similar points. Rae Votta of Billboard commented on the [...] "weird" [...] plotline that involved Artie and Coach Beiste, for which Kubicek called Artie's actions [...] "inappropriate". While Hyman [...] "liked Artie coming into his own as a director", she called his pre-show jitters [...] "jarring", though she called his final speech [...] "a nice moment", and Benigno characterized it as [...] "a kind of cheesy but actually appropriate speech". Futterman felt it was a [...] "valid and heartwarming point", but [...] "awkwardly slotted in". Poniewozik credited Jones as Coach Beiste with [...] "stunning work", and Kubicek said Beiste's [...] "fragile lack of self-esteem" [...] was [...] "believable and heartfelt" [...] and that Jones was [...] "brilliant".|$|E

500|$|The album reached #4 on the Japan Oricon charts, {{and sold}} 101,000 copies as of January 2010. The album was well received; many reviewers {{found that it}} was a [...] "good" [...] soundtrack, though not without faults. Josh Bizeau and Roko Zaper of Soundtrack Central {{especially}} liked it, finding it to be [...] "a blessing for Final Fantasy music", and both Patrick Gann of RPGFan and Isaac Engelhorn of Soundtrack Central felt it was Uematsu's second-best work to date, behind only the soundtrack of Final Fantasy VI. Ben Schweitzer of RPGFan, however, found that the heavy reliance of the soundtrack on music and themes from previous Final Fantasy soundtracks resulted in a sense of [...] "stretched creativity" [...] and [...] "a bit of blandness", though he still felt it was not [...] "a bad soundtrack... not <b>really</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> soundtrack." [...] Other reviewers, however, such as Engelhorn and Tyler Schulley of Final Fantasy Symphony, enjoyed the fact that it pulled from previous soundtracks, feeling that it gave the album [...] "the classic feel of the older Final Fantasies" [...] while still being [...] "original and beautiful".|$|E
500|$|A {{departure}} from other {{games in the}} franchise, Guitar Hero: Aerosmith follows the career of Aerosmith, by playing significant songs in their catalog in a 'rough chronological fashion'. The gameplay follows the band through various periods in its history, spanning from its first show at Mendon Nipmuc Regional High School in 1970 to the 2001 Super Bowl XXXV halftime show, to their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 19, 2001. The player starts as Joe Perry, and will eventually be able to unlock Brad Whitford and Tom Hamilton.Guitar Hero popularity | work = USA Today | first = Mike | last = Snider | date = 2008-02-14 | accessdate = 2008-03-03}} The game does not focus on the internal strife and stress within the band; Guitarist Joe Perry stated that the game would focus on {{the positive aspects of}} Aerosmith's history. Perry has stated that [...] "Having a game built around Aerosmith has been a huge honor and <b>really</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> experience for us. We've put a lot of ideas into the game so that fans can have fun interacting with our music, getting inside our body of work and learning about the band's history." ...|$|E
500|$|Other aspects {{grew out}} of basic {{concepts}} or ideas. For the episode [...] "Skin", writer Shiban felt that the shapeshifting villain had to change {{into one of the}} lead characters. The character chosen was Dean, and the writers decided not to clear his name of attempted murder {{at the end of the}} episode. Though they at first feared that having one of the main characters be a wanted man would later ruin the show, the writers eventually felt it was [...] "a great layer to add", opening up new potential storylines and characters. Dean's reputation is addressed again in [...] "The Benders", and catches up to him in the second and third seasons. Another element that would influence future episodes came about in [...] "Hook Man" [...] when writers Milbauer and Burton realized that shotguns shoot salt, a weakness for spirits. Kripke deemed it the [...] "perfect combination of occult element", as it brought together a [...] "folkloric repellent of evil" [...] with the [...] "blue-collar aspect of shotguns". The episode [...] "Asylum" [...] later established iron as another weapon against ghosts. [...] "Faith", on the other hand, stemmed from the question of whether it truly was wrong to heal good people of their illnesses at the cost of the lives of strangers. Kripke noted, [...] " [...] <b>really</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> girl and she deserves to live, and some stranger you don't even know will die... and maybe that's worth it." [...] Reapers were not in the original script of the episode, but were added later to give the writers a chance to create [...] "scary" [...] sequences and to explain the faith healer's ability. Because the writers found the traditional look of the Reaper—hooded and carrying a sickle—to be cheesy, they ultimately made him appear as [...] "the most shriveled old man you could ever imagine".|$|E

[...] (Chapin, p. xi) Ted Chapin wrote, [...] "Taken as a whole, the collection of reviews Follies received was as rangy as possible." [...] (Chapin, p.300) In his New York Times review of the original Broadway production, Clive Barnes wrote: [...] "...it is stylish, innovative, it has some of the best lyrics I have ever encountered, and above all it is a serious attempt to deal with the musical form."

2500|$|Continuing his {{outstanding}} form in Serie A {{and in the}} Champions League for the 2010–11 campaign, he was pivotal to Inter's attack line. On 16 March 2011, Eto'o gave {{a legendary}} performance in Munich as he helped Inter eliminate Bayern Munich 3–2 (with an aggregate score of 3–3, winning on away goals) in the Champions League. Eto'o scored the first goal after four minutes, and provided two clinical assists to Wesley Sneijder and to Goran Pandev for the winner. After the game, Inter President Massimo Moratti said, [...] "I'm not sure if the deal that brought Eto'o to the club was my best piece of transfer business ever, but I really {{think it was a}} great piece of business for us. Eto'o is fantastic. I do not want to take anything away from Ibrahimović, but for everyone it was <b>really</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal to get Eto'o. Samuel is truly extraordinary." [...] On 29 May, Eto'o scored two goals in the final of the Coppa Italia against Palermo to help Inter win 3–1 and taking his total season goals to 37, a new record high for him.|$|E
2500|$|Vocalist and guitarist José Feliciano {{experienced}} significant international success when {{he released}} {{his version of}} [...] "Light My Fire" [...] in 1968 as a single on the RCA Victor label. It is perhaps the best known cover of this song, reaching number 3 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 charts, only {{a year after the}} original had been a number 1 hit on the same chart. Feliciano's remake blended Latin influences, including a mixture of classic Spanish guitar, flute and flamenco, with American pop. Feliciano's version of the song is played at a slower tempo than the Doors. The single helped to spur the worldwide success of its album, Feliciano!, which was nominated for multiple Grammy Awards in 1969. Feliciano's arrangement of [...] "Light My Fire" [...] has influenced several subsequent versions, including that by Will Young. Songwriter Robby Krieger said in an interview about the cover: [...] "It's <b>really</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> feeling to have written a classic. I think I owe a big debt to Jose Feliciano because he is actually the one, when he did it, everybody started doing it. He did a whole different arrangement on it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyrics on {{the album}} deal with various subjects. [...] "Raised on Rock" [...] is a song about Scorpions' {{philosophy}} of life. Meine explained [...] "We all started listening the music and growing up with the music back in the 60s". Schenker also added [...] ""Raised on Rock" [...] is our soundtrack {{and it will be}} our soundtrack until the end of our days. It's the reason why we formed the band." [...] Songs [...] "Let's Rock", [...] "Rock Zone" [...] and [...] "Spirit of Rock" [...] deal with the same subject. [...] "Sting in the Tail" [...] is a song about attitude and as Schenker said [...] "it is <b>really</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> symbol of what the Scorpions are all about". [...] "The Good Die Young" [...] is an anti-war song about soldiers in Afghanistan and all the people around the world who stand for freedom and peace. Meine explained [...] "We all live in trouble times. I think that song is trying to express that kind of feeling". Lyrics for the song were inspired by the conversation between Meine and his friend who was preparing to go to Afghanistan for eight months. Meine said: [...] "In between the lines I could hear, 'Well, let’s hope I come back home alive'." [...] "Lorelei" [...] is a song about the legend of the water-spirit Lorelei who lives {{on the top of the}} rock Loreley above the river Rhine. [...] "SLY" [...] is the fictional song about a girl named Sly. Meine explained [...] "When [...] "Still Loving You" [...] was a smash hit back in the '80s, many folks made love to that song, obviously. Many people told us in Europe, especially France, 'We called our daughter Sly because of Still Loving You'" ...|$|E
