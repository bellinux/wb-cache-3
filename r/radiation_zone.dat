5|$|At {{the center}} of the Sun is the core region, a volume of {{sufficient}} temperature and pressure for nuclear fusion to occur. Above the core is the <b>radiation</b> <b>zone,</b> where the plasma conveys the energy flux by means of radiation. Above that is the convection zone where the gas material transports energy primarily through physical displacement of the gas known as convection. It is believed that the movement of mass within the convection zone creates the magnetic activity that generates sunspots.|$|E
5|$|Because {{there is}} a {{temperature}} difference between the core and the surface, or photosphere, energy is transported outward. The two modes for transporting this energy are radiation and convection. A <b>radiation</b> <b>zone,</b> where energy is transported by radiation, is stable against convection and {{there is very little}} mixing of the plasma. By contrast, in a convection zone the energy is transported by bulk movement of plasma, with hotter material rising and cooler material descending. Convection is a more efficient mode for carrying energy than radiation, but it will only occur under conditions that create a steep temperature gradient.|$|E
5|$|The <b>radiation</b> <b>zone</b> is {{the region}} of the stellar {{interior}} where the flux of energy outward is dependent on radiative heat transfer, since convective heat transfer is inefficient in that zone. In this region the plasma will not be perturbed, and any mass motions will die out. If this is not the case, however, then the plasma becomes unstable and convection will occur, forming a convection zone. This can occur, for example, in regions where very high energy fluxes occur, such as near the core or in areas with high opacity (making radiatative heat transfer inefficient) as in the outer envelope.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the energy}} {{produced}} at Vega's core is generated by the carbonnitrogenoxygen cycle (CNO cycle), a nuclear fusion process that combines protons to form helium nuclei through intermediary nuclei of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. This process requires a temperature of about 15millionK, which {{is higher than the}} core temperature of the Sun, but is less efficient than the Sun's proton-proton chain reaction fusion reaction. The CNO cycle is highly temperature sensitive, which results in a convection zone about the core that evenly distributes the 'ash' from the fusion reaction within the core region. The overlying atmosphere is in radiative equilibrium. This is in contrast to the Sun, which has a <b>radiation</b> <b>zone</b> centered on the core with an overlying convection zone.|$|E
25|$|The {{abundant}} {{population of}} solid bodies orbiting Saturn including moons {{as well as}} ring particles exerts a strong influence on the magnetosphere of Saturn. The plasma in the magnetosphere co-rotates with the planet, continuously impinging on the trailing hemispheres of slowly moving moons. While ring particles {{and the majority of}} moons only passively absorb plasma and energetic charged particles, three moons – Enceladus, Dione and Titan – are significant sources of new plasma. The absorption of energetic electrons and ions reveals itself by noticeable gaps in the radiation belts of Saturn near the moon's orbits, while the dense rings of Saturn completely eliminate all energetic electrons and ions closer than 2.2RS, creating a low <b>radiation</b> <b>zone</b> {{in the vicinity of the}} planet. The absorption of the co-rotating plasma by a moon disturbs the magnetic field in its empty wake—the field is pulled towards a moon, creating a region of a stronger magnetic field in the near wake.|$|E

40|$|Surfaces of {{constant}} pressure and constant density do not coincide in differentially rotating stars. Stellar <b>radiation</b> <b>zones</b> with baroclinic stratification can be unstable. Instabilities in <b>radiation</b> <b>zones</b> are of crucial importance for angular momentum transport, mixing of chemical species and, possibly, for magnetic field generation. This paper performs linear analysis of baroclinic instability in differentially rotating stars. Linear stability equations are formulated for differential rotation of arbitrary shape and then solved numerically for rotation non-uniform in radius. As the differential rotation increases, r- and g-modes of initially stable global oscillations transform smoothly into growing modes of baroclinic instability. The instability {{can therefore be}} interpreted as stability loss to r- and g-modes excitation. Regions of stellar parameters where r- or g-modes are preferentially excited are defined. Baroclinic instability onsets at a very small differential rotation of below 1 %. The characteristic time of instability growth is about one thousand rotation periods. Growing disturbances possess kinetic helicity. Magnetic field generation by the turbulence resulting from baroclinic instability in differentially rotating <b>radiation</b> <b>zones</b> is, therefore, possible.

40|$|Abstract. We briefly {{recall the}} {{physical}} {{background of the}} transport of angular momentum and the mixing of chemicals inside stellar <b>radiation</b> <b>zones</b> and its importance for stellar evolution.

This research is aimed at improving the modeling of stellar interiors in the perspective of future astero and helioseismology missions such as COROT and GOLF-NG. 1 Rotational mixing In standard models of stellar interiors, <b>radiation</b> <b>zones</b> which are convectively stable are postulated to be without motion other than rotation.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a {{critical analysis of}} the classical definitions of the radiation regions for the particular case of short, 212, or 1 dipole antennas, regions which we have revisited. We worked out a definition of <b>radiation</b> <b>zones</b> from consistent criteria directly linked with radiation characteristics: radiated field, wavefront, wave impedance, and radiated power. The ”far-field zone ” boundary is then defined as the distance beyond which the radiated wave is spherical and the radial component of the fields is negligible compared to the transverse component. Next, we consider the “near-field-reactive or very-near-field zone” to be the region wherein the wave impedance is different from 2, = 120 ~~ and wherein the reactive power is not negligible {{when compared to the}} active power. In this paper, the short dipole case is first studied. Dipoles of length up to 1 are also treated, considering diameters from 0 up to 1 / 20. The results obtained lead us to accurately set the boundaries of the <b>radiation</b> <b>zones</b> of dipoles without the need for the restrictive hypotheses of the classical definitions...|$|R

50|$|For main {{sequence}} stars—those stars that are generating energy through the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen at the core, {{the presence and}} location of radiative regions depends on the star's mass. Main sequence stars below about 0.3 solar masses are entirely convective, meaning {{they do not have}} a radiative zone. From 0.3 to 1.2 solar masses, the region around the stellar core is a <b>radiation</b> <b>zone,</b> separated from the overlying convection zone by the tachocline. The radius of the radiative zone increases monotonically with mass, with stars around 1.2 solar masses being almost entirely radiative.

40|$|Helicity and α effect {{driven by}} the nonaxisymmetric Tayler {{instability}} of toroidal magnetic fields in stellar <b>radiation</b> <b>zones</b> are computed. In the linear approximation a purely toroidal field always excites pairs of modes with identical growth rates but with opposite helicity so that the net helicity vanishes. If the magnetic background field has a helical structure by an extra (weak) poloidal component {{then one of the}} modes dominates producing a net kinetic helicity anticorrelated to the current helicity of the background field. The mean electromotive force is computed with the result that the α effect by the most rapidly growing mode has the same sign as the current helicity of the background field. The α effect is found as too small to drive an α^ 2 dynamo but the excitation conditions for an αΩ dynamo can be fulfilled for weak poloidal fields. Moreover, if the dynamo produces its own α effect by the magnetic instability then problems with its sign do not arise. For all cases, however, the α effect shows an extremely strong concentration to the poles so that a possible αΩ dynamo might only work at the polar regions. Hence, the results of our linear theory lead to a new topological problem for the existence of large-scale dynamos in stellar <b>radiation</b> <b>zones</b> {{on the basis of the}} current-driven instability of toroidal fields.
