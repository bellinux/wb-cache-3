5000|$|Residential leases are {{contracts}} {{that are designed}} for individuals or groups to live, or reside, in the leased space. Most governmental entities have [...] "recognized {{the sanctity of the}} home." [...] Therefore, lessees of <b>residential</b> <b>spaces</b> are generally afforded more rights and protections than commercial leases. It is also because of the presumption of unequal bargaining power that <b>residential</b> <b>spaces</b> are afforded more protections. States, counties, and cities have different laws, and likewise, varying levels of protections for the tenants and landlords of commercial spaces.|$|R
5|$|Tracing {{its history}} {{back to the}} 1870s, the Ghetto now {{includes}} more than 200 university-owned houses as well as landlord-owned houses, high-density housing and gathering spaces. With the inclusion of Holy Angels and The Darkside, two smaller neighborhoods the university owns property in, {{there are more than}} 400 houses currently used as student <b>residential</b> <b>space.</b> Because of the area's age, the university has been engaged in a program to renovate and update the Ghetto, and several additional changes to the neighborhood are expected in the coming years as part of the university's Master Plan.|$|E
5|$|After {{many years}} of decline, the Sheffield economy {{is going through a}} strong revival. The 2004 Barclays Bank Financial Planning study {{revealed}} that, in 2003, the Sheffield district of Hallam was the highest ranking area outside London for overall wealth, the proportion of people earning over £60,000 a year standing at almost 12%. A survey by Knight Frank revealed that Sheffield was the fastest-growing city outside London for office and <b>residential</b> <b>space</b> and rents {{during the second half of}} 2004. This can be seen by the current surge of redevelopments, including the City Lofts Tower and accompanying St Paul's Place, Velocity Living and the Moor redevelopment, the forthcoming NRQ and the recently completed Winter Gardens, Peace Gardens, Millennium Galleries and many projects under the Sheffield One redevelopment agency. The Sheffield economy grew from £5.6billion in 1997 (1997 GVA) to £9.2billion in 2007 (2007 GVA).|$|E
5|$|The entire {{district}} is densely developed, primarily residential in its {{northern and southern}} portions, with commercial use concentrated in central blocks near Monument Square. The only significant open spaces within it are the one-block Washington Park near its southern end and Seminary Park, the main quad at Russell Sage. Most of the major streets and the central area of the district are lined with multi-story dwellings that are primarily commercial but {{with a mix of}} office and <b>residential</b> <b>space</b> on their upper floors. On the side streets, there are smaller-scale residential townhouses. Institutional use is limited to Russell Sage, a few churches, RPI's buildings and governmental structures like the county courthouse and post office. No industrial use, past or present, is within the district, with the notable exception of the Gurley Building, and even that has been scaled back in recent years.|$|E

25|$|As {{its name}} suggests, a shophouse often {{contains}} a shop with separate residential spaces. More generally, space {{occupied by the}} former contains a semi-public function. While this usually is, and historically usually was, a shop, it {{could just as easily}} be a food and beverage outlet (e.g. coffeeshop or bar), a service provider (e.g. clinic or barber), an industrial activity (e.g. cottage industry or auto workshop) or a community space (e.g. a school or clan association). Residential spaces are meant to accommodate one or more families, or serve as a dormitory for single workers. Popular belief holds that shophouses were initially occupied by single families, with their private living areas in one space and the more public family business in another. However, {{it is possible that the}} two spaces were always usually used by unrelated persons or groups, who may be tenants or resident owners. The position of the shop and <b>residential</b> <b>space</b> depends on the number of floors of the shophouse: A single storey shophouse tends to include <b>residential</b> <b>space</b> behind the shop, while residential spaces in shophouses of two or more storeys are typically located above the shop.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1970s, {{the demand}} for office and <b>residential</b> <b>space</b> around the UCLA campus has {{resulted}} {{in much of the}} original Mediterranean architecture giving way to large modern high rises, as depicted in the photograph to the right. Preservationists sought to preserve what could be saved of the original Westwood architecture, and in 1988 the Ralphs-Bratskeller-Egyptian Theater building was designated as a Historic Cultural Monument (HCM #360) by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission. Eight other historic buildings in Westwood Village (including the Fox Bruin Theater, the Fox Village Theater and the Janss Investment Company Building) were given monument status at the same time. In 1992, the Ralphs building was also added to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
25|$|The 80th {{floor of}} the {{original}} design was planned to be an observation deck, {{the first one in}} Miami. The complex was later redesigned as two 70-floor towers, with the main tower being all office space, hence taller. The shorter tower was to be all hotel space. The current design goes back to a single mixed-use tower with 80 floors on a large podium with the top floors being office space and the bottom being hotel or <b>residential</b> <b>space.</b> The observation deck {{can be seen in the}} schematic diagram. Two FECR published sources have gone back to the floor count of 80 with the 1,010-foot design, and renderings of this design from 2009 show an observation deck, as well as the Metromover connection, in the blueprints.|$|E
25|$|The Traub Brothers Jewelry Building is a four-story wood-frame brick {{building}}, {{built in}} 1879. Presumably {{the first floor}} was used as retail while the upper floors were used as <b>residential</b> <b>space.</b> The building was purchased by Grand Trunk Railroad early in the 20th century, and in 1911 it was renovated to serve as their ticketing office. Grand Trunk removed the second floor and installed a vaulted ceiling reminiscent of period railroad stations. The renovation added a rounded arch on the second floor, filled with paned windows and surrounded by terra cotta detailing with the company's logo. The finely detailed interior woodwork also includes company logos. Although the lower floors of the building were completely altered during this renovation, the upper two floors still retain the original window shapes.|$|E
