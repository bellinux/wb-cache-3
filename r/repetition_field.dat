An aesthetic experience is just the experience of aesthetic properties and formal relations of a work. But this leads to problems concerning the attribution of aesthetic properties and whether we detect them or they are merely projected. Carroll suggests that {{the mere fact that}} we disagree about the attribution of aesthetic properties gives us at least some minimal reasons to presume that aesthetic properties are objective. Our response to art is unique and not precisely intellectual; beauty and perfection that we find in works of art do not consist of concepts but sense impressions.

40|$|Biomedical Tissue Engineering, Biomaterials, and Medical Devices Poster SessionA {{device to}} stimulate bone and muscle cell growth and {{possibly}} {{for treatment of}} bone and muscle injuries is presented. The device, called EStim, generates electric and magnetic pulses at programmable intervals. This device will {{also be used to}} study the crosstalk between bone and muscle cell growth. In a human or animal body, muscles and bones are intimately interrelated and the loss of activity in one of them affects the other. This interrelation is especially evident in persons with bone fractures. While the bone is healing, the muscles loose mass due to lack of exercise. Furthermore, when skeletal muscles are not exercised, bone mass decreases. In these situations, muscle mass can be partially maintained if externally stimulated by applying repetitive electric pulses. The EStim has been designed to generate electric pulses of different frequencies and amplitudes to stimulate muscle growth. It also generates magnetic pulses to stimulate bone growth. This dual stimulation is a unique feature of the EStim and makes it a promising device in the treatment of bone fractures or for muscle stimulation. Besides this clinical application, the EStim is being used to study the crosstalk at the cellular level between muscle and bone cells. A line of C 2 C 12 cells is being used to test the effects of the electric and magnetic pulses on cell growth. Variables such as pulse <b>repetition,</b> <b>field</b> strength and rest period duration have been evaluated. Initial results show that electric stimulation induces cell hypertrophy similar to the ones observed in heat shock experiments (see abstract by Romero et al). The EStim device consists of three sections: the controller, the high-voltage generation unit and the high-current generation unit. The controller is built around the MSP 430 low-power microcontroller. It handles communication with a host computer to change settings or to perform tests. Settings such as pulse repetition, pulse width, number of pulses, rest time between pulses, and magnetic field strength can be changed by the user. The controller also monitors the battery voltage and the maximum pulse current. As a safety measure, pulse generation is stopped if the current through the probe exceeds a preset value. The high-voltage generation unit consists of a boost converter that is able to generate voltages up to 40 V and an H-bridge that allows the generation of biphasic or monophasic electric pulses. The high-current unit consists of a buck converter able to generate currents up to 10 A. These large currents are used to generate magnetic fields of up to 10 mT. This device will be used to better understand the interplay between bones and muscles. Ultimately, our goal is test this device in animals and humans to fully realize its applications on musculoskeletal injuries and diseases...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that place cells in the {{hippocampus}} possess firing fields that repeat in physically similar, parallel environments. These results imply that it should be difficult for animals to distinguish parallel environments at a behavioral level. To test this, we trained rats on a novel odor-location task in an environment with four parallel compartments which had previously been shown to yield place <b>field</b> <b>repetition.</b> A second group of animals was trained on the same task, but with the compartments arranged in different directions, an arrangement we hypothesised would yield less place <b>field</b> <b>repetition.</b> Learning of the odor-location task in the parallel compartments was significantly impaired relative to learning in the radially arranged compartments. Fewer animals acquired the full discrimination in the parallel compartments compared to those trained in the radial compartments, and the former also required many more sessions to reach criterion compared to the latter. To confirm that the arrangement of compartments yielded differences in place cell repetition, in a separate group of animals we recorded from CA 1 place cells in both environments. We found that CA 1 place cells exhibited repeated fields across four parallel local compartments, but did not do so when the same compartments were arranged radially. To confirm that the differences in place <b>field</b> <b>repetition</b> across the parallel and radial compartments depended on their angular arrangement, and not incidental differences in access to an extra-maze visual landmark, we repeated the recordings in a second set of rats {{in the absence of the}} orientation landmark. We found, once again, that place <b>fields</b> showed <b>repetition</b> in parallel compartments, and did not do so in radially arranged compartments. Thus place <b>field</b> <b>repetition,</b> or lack thereof, in these compartments was not dependent on extra-maze cues.

40|$|Hippocampal place cells support spatial {{cognition}} and {{are thought}} to form the neural substrate of a global 'cognitive map'. A widely held view is that parts of the hippocampus also underlie the ability to separate patterns, or to provide different neural codes for distinct environments. However, {{a number of studies}} have shown that in environments composed of multiple, repeating compartments, place cells and other spatially modulated neurons show the same activity in each local area. This <b>repetition</b> of firing <b>fields</b> may reflect pattern completion, and may make it difficult for animals to distinguish similar local environments. In this review we will (a) highlight some of the navigation difficulties encountered by humans in repetitive environments, (b) summarise literature demonstrating that place and grid cells represent local and not global space, and (c) attempt to explain the origin of these phenomena.

40|$|The spatial mapping {{function}} of the hippocampal formation is likely derived from two sets of information: one based on the external environment and the other based on self-motion. Here, we further characterize âboundary vector cellsâ (BVCs) in the rat subiculum, which code space relative to one type of cue in the external environment: boundaries. We find {{that the majority of}} cells with fields near the perimeter of a walled environment exhibit an additional firing field when an upright barrier is inserted into the walled environment in a manner predicted by the BVC model. We use this property of <b>field</b> <b>repetition</b> as a heuristic measure to define BVCs, and characterize their spatial and temporal properties. In further tests, we find that subicular BVCs typically treat drop edges similarly to walls, including exhibiting <b>field</b> <b>repetition</b> when additional drop-type boundaries are added to the testing environment. In other words, BVCs treat both kinds of edge as environmental boundaries, despite their dissimilar sensory properties.

40|$|Radiotherapy is long {{recognised}} as {{a method}} to treat cancer. In recent years, advanced radiotherapy techniques such as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) has been introduced. These techniques allows the delivery of escalated radiation dose with better target conformity, {{which leads to the}} needs of precise and accurate treatment verification to ensure the correct dose is being delivered to the target during radiotherapy. Besides the pre-treatment quality assurance, in-vivo dose verification may be needed. Optically stimulated luminescence dosimeter (OSLD) is a relatively new dosimeter which uses light photons to stimulate the release of dosimetric traps. This study covers the characterisation and application of the OSLD in selected radiotherapy techniques. The first part of this study investigated the physical characteristics of the OSLD for dosimetry under megavoltage photon beams.

40|$|Abstract Background Despite {{advances}} in transplant surgery and general medicine, {{the number of}} patients awaiting transplant organs continues to grow, while the supply of organs does not. This work outlines a method of organ decellularization using non-thermal irreversible electroporation (N-TIRE) which, in combination with reseeding, may help supplement the supply of organs for transplant. Methods In our study, brief but intense electric pulses were applied to porcine livers while under active low temperature cardio-emulation perfusion. Histological analysis and lesion measurements were used {{to determine the effects of}} the pulses in decellularizing the livers as a first step towards the development of extracellular scaffolds that may be used with stem cell reseeding. A dynamic conductivity numerical model was developed to simulate the treatment parameters used and determine an irreversible electroporation threshold. Results Ninety-nine individual 1000 V/cm 100 -Î¼s square pulses with repetition rates between 0. 25 and 4 Hz were found to produce a lesion within 24 hours post-treatment. The livers maintained intact bile ducts and vascular structures while demonstrating hepatocytic cord disruption and cell delamination from cord basal laminae after 24 hours of perfusion. A numerical model found an electric field threshold of 423 V/cm under specific experimental conditions, which may be used in the future to plan treatments for the decellularization of entire organs. Analysis of the pulse repetition rate shows that the largest treated area and the lowest interstitial density score was achieved for a pulse frequency of 1 Hz. After 24 hours of perfusion, a maximum density score reduction of 58. 5 percent had been achieved. Conclusions This method is the first effort towards creating decellularized tissue scaffolds that could be used for organ transplantation using N-TIRE. In addition, it provides a versatile platform to study the effects of pulse parameters such as pulse length, <b>repetition</b> rate, and <b>field</b> strength on whole organ structures. </p...|$|R

Twice during the growing season and at harvest, the aboveground biomass, separated by lupin, partners and weeds, were recorded. The results of the first project year show that all the partner plants which should serve as artificial weeds were successfully established. False flax leads to the strongest effect on the development of lupins, which showed the lowest biomass production in these variants. In comparison to the sown partners, the false flax variants also showed the highest biomass production, while the lowest biomass production was recorded for the natural weeds occurring at the site.

60|$|A {{mountain}} valley has, at the best, {{a certain}} prison-like {{effect on the}} imagination, but a mountain valley, an Alpine winter, and an invalid's weakness make up among them a prison {{of the most effective}} kind. The roads indeed are cleared, and at least one footpath dodging up the hill; but to these the health-seeker is rigidly confined. There are for him no cross-cuts over the field, no following of streams, no unguided rambles in the wood. His walks are cut and dry. In five or six different directions he can push as far, and no farther, than his strength permits; never deviating from the line laid down for him and beholding at each <b>repetition</b> the same <b>field</b> of wood and snow from the same corner of the road. This, of itself, would be a little trying to the patience in the course of months; but to this is added, by the heaped mantle of the snow, an almost utter absence of detail and an almost unbroken identity of colour. Snow, it is true, is not merely white. The sun touches it with roseate and golden lights. Its own crushed infinity of crystals, its own richness of tiny sculpture, fills it, when regarded near at hand, with wonderful depths of coloured shadow, and, though wintrily transformed, it is still water, and has watery tones of blue. But, when all is said, these fields of white and blots of crude black forest are but a trite and staring substitute for the infinite variety and pleasantness of the earth's face. Even a boulder, whose front is too precipitous to have retained the snow, seems, if you come upon it in your walk, a perfect gem of colour, reminds you almost painfully of other places, and brings into your head the delights of more Arcadian days--the path across the meadow, the hazel dell, the lilies on the stream, and the scents, the colours, and the whisper of the woods. And scents here are as rare as colours. Unless you get a gust of kitchen in passing some hotel, you shall smell nothing all day long but the faint and choking odour of frost. Sounds, too, are absent: not a bird pipes, not a bough waves, in the dead, windless atmosphere. If a sleigh goes by, the sleigh-bells ring, and that is all; you work all winter through to no other accompaniment but the crunching of your steps upon the frozen snow.|$|R

Foram avaliados sete tratamentos in vitro: 1) testemunha; 2) AZ- 1 mg L- 1; 3) Trifenil hidrÃ³xido de estanho (THE) - 1 mg L- 1; 4) AZ- 10 mg L- 1; 5) THE- 10 mg L- 1; 6) AZ- 100 mg L- 1 e 7) THE- 100 mg L- 1 e 13 tratamentos in vivo: 1) testemunha; 2) AZ aplicado 24 horas antes da inoculaÃ§Ã£o (AZ- 24); 3) THE- 24; 4) AZ- 48; 5) THE- 48; 6) AZ- 72; 7) THE- 72; 8) AZ- 96; 9) THE- 96; 10) AZ- 120; 11) THE- 120; 12) AZ- 144 e 13) THE- 144. Azocyclotin foi avaliado Ã  dose de 125 g i. a. 100 L- 1 de Ã¡gua e trifenil hidrÃ³xido de estanho a 41, 25 g i. a. 100 L- 1. Os delineamentos experimentais foram inteiramente ao acaso, com cinco repetiÃ§Ãµes. Em condiÃ§Ãµes de campo, foi realizado um experimento com seis tratamentos. Os tratamentos e as doses em g ha- 1 de i. a foram: 1) tebuconazole + trifenil hidrÃ³xido de estanho (100 + 200); 2) tebuconazole + trifloxystrobin (40 + 100); 3) trifloxystrobin (125); 4) tebuconazole + azocyclotin (100 + 500); 5) azocyclotin (500) e 6) testemunha. O delineamento foi em blocos ao acaso, com quatro repetiÃ§Ãµes. Para a avaliaÃ§Ã£o in vitro foram medidos diÃ¢metros ortogonais do crescimento micelial do fungo em BDA; in vivo e no campo usou-se escala de notas de 1 a 9, sendo 1 = sem sintoma e 9 = igual ou mais de 25 % de Ã¡rea foliar afetada. In vitro, o tratamento 7 proporcionou maior inibiÃ§Ã£o do desenvolvimento micelial. Em plÃ¢ntulas, observou-se controle de C. lindemuthianum atÃ© 144 horas, pelos dois produtos. Uma nova constataÃ§Ã£o em campo foi o controle de antracnose pelo acaricida azocyclotin, em que se observou tambÃ©m efeito sobre mancha-angular e mancha-de-alternÃ¡ria. Concluiu-se que o acaricida azocyclotin Ã© eficiente no controle da antracnose do feijoeiro, semelhante ao trifenil hidrÃ³xido de estanho. The control effect of azocyclotin acaricide was tested to common bean anthracnose pathogen, Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, in vitro, seedlings and in field conditions. The treatments in vitro were: 1) Test; 2) Azocyclotin (AZ) - 1 AZ- 1 mg. L- 1; 3) Triphenil sthanic hydroxide (THE) - 1 mg L- 1; 4) AZ- 10 mg L- 1; 5) THE- 10 mg L- 1; 6) AZ- 100 mg L- 1 and 7) THE- 100 mg L- 1 and in vivo treatments were: 1) Test; 2) AZ applyed 24 hours before inoculation (AZ- 24); 3) THE- 24; 4) AZ- 48; 5) THE- 48; 6) AZ- 72; 7) THE- 72; 8) AZ- 96; 9) THE- 96; 10) AZ- 120; 11) THE- 120; 12) AZ- 144, and 13) THE- 144. Azocyclotin was evaluated at 125 g. 100 L- 1 {{of water and}} fenthin hydroxide at 41, 25 g a. i. 100 L- 1. The experiments were set up as a completely randomized design, with 5 <b>repetitions.</b> In <b>field</b> conditions, the treatments (g ha- 1 a. i.) included: 1) tebuconazole + fentin hydroxide- 100 + 200; 2) tebuconazole + trifloxystrobin- 40 + 100; 3) trifloxystrobin- 125; 4) tebuconazole + azocyclotin- 100 + 500; 5) azocyclotin - 500 and 6) without chemical. The experimental design was done using randomized blocks, with 4 replicates. The mycelial growth was determined through reading the fungi radial growth in BDA culture media. In vivo and in field conditions, evaluations were made with a scale of 1 to 9, where 1 = without symptoms and 9 = equal or more than 25 % of foliar area with anthracnose symptoms. In vitro test, the treatment 7 presented the most effective mycelial development inhibition. Azocyclotin and triphenil sthanic hydroxide controlled dry bean anthracnose when applied until 144 hours before inoculation. A new field record was the control of bean anthracnose with azocyclotin acaricide, with effect on both to angular leaf spot and alternaria leaf spot. It was concluded that azocyclotin acaricide can control dry bean anthracnose with similar efficiency as fentin hydroxide...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that as animals explore their environment they build and maintain a cognitive map, an internal representation of their surroundings (Tolman, 1948). We tested this hypothesis using a task designed to assess the ability of rats to make a spatial inference (take a novel shortcut) (Roberts et al., 2007). Our findings suggest that rats are unable to make a spontaneous spatial inference. Furthermore, they bear similarities to experiments which have been similarly unable to replicate or support Tolmanâs (1948) findings. An inability to take novel shortcuts suggests that rats do not possess a cognitive map (Bennett, 1996). However, we found evidence of alternative learning strategies, such as latent learning (Tolman & Honzik, 1930 b), which suggest that rats may still be building such a representation, although {{it does not appear}} they are able to utilise this information to make complex spatial computations. Neurons found in the hippocampus show remarkable spatial modulation of their firing rate and have been suggested as a possible neural substrate for a cognitive map (O'Keefe & Nadel, 1978). However, the firing of these place cells often appears to be modulated by features of an animalâs behaviour (Ainge, Tamosiunaite, et al., 2007; Wood, Dudchenko, Robitsek, & Eichenbaum, 2000). For instance, previous experiments have demonstrated that the firing rate of place fields in the start box of some mazes are predictive of the animalâs final destination (Ainge, Tamosiunaite, et al., 2007; Ferbinteanu & Shapiro, 2003). We sought to understand whether this prospective firing is in fact related to the goal the rat is planning to navigate to or the route the rat is planning to take. Our results provide strong evidence for the latter, suggesting that rats may not be aware of the location of specific goals and may not be aware of their environment {{in the form of a}} contiguous map. However, we also found behavioural evidence that rats are aware of specific goal locations, suggesting that place cells in the hippocampus may not be responsible for this representation and that it may reside elsewhere (Hok, Chah, Save, & Poucet, 2013). Unlike their typical activity in an open field, place cells often have multiple place fields in geometrically similar areas of a multicompartment environment (Derdikman et al., 2009; Spiers et al., 2013). For example, Spiers et al. (2013) found that in an environment composed of four parallel compartments, place cells often fired similarly in multiple compartments, despite the active movement of the rat between them. We were able to replicate this phenomenon, furthermore, we were also able to show that if the compartments are arranged in a radial configuration this repetitive firing does not occur as frequently. We suggest that this place <b>field</b> <b>repetition</b> is driven by inputs from Boundary Vector Cells (BVCs) in neighbouring brain regions which are in turn greatly modulated by inputs from the head direction system. This is supported by a novel BVC model of place cell firing which predicts our observed results accurately. If place cells form the neural basis of a cognitive map one would predict spatial learning to be difficult in an environment where repetitive firing is observed frequently (Spiers et al., 2013). We tested this hypothesis by training animals on an odour discrimination task in the maze environments described above. We found that rats trained in the parallel version of the task were significantly impaired when compared to the radial version. These results support the hypothesis that place cells form the neural basis of a cognitive map; in environments where it is difficult to discriminate compartments based on the firing of place cells, rats find it similarly difficult to discriminate these compartments as shown by their behaviour. The experiments reported here are discussed in terms of a cognitive map, the likelihood that such a construct exists and the possibility that place cells form the neural basis of such a representation. Although the results of our experiments could be interpreted as evidence that animals do not possess a cognitive map, ultimately they suggest that animals do have a cognitive map and that place cells form a more than adequate substrate for this representation...|$|R
40|$|The {{verification}} {{and certification}} of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) integrity {{is based on}} the analysis of extremely rare events which can lead to large positioning errors. These events are generally only dealt with on a theoretical basis. The most important of these effects are large ionospheric delays for absolute positioning, strong ionospheric gradients for relative positioning, signal deformation, satellite and receiver clock irregularities and strong antenna multipath. Anomalies in these domains occur with such a low <b>repetition</b> rate that <b>field</b> testing alone does not usually include them during the testing period. However, the ability to simulate these events in RF measurements would allow hardware to be tested against these threats, thereby greatly increasing our confidence in the robustness of the navigation system. This paper describes our implementation of comprehensive ionospheric threat generation within the German Aerospace Centerâs (DLR) Master GNSS Simulator {{that can be used for}} comprehensive receiver testing in hardware. Augmentation systems can correct GNSS navigation errors induced by the ionosphere on a local or regional scale. In these systems, normal ionospheric behavior has a limited impact on the position error. In particular, the confidence interval of the user position is fully acceptable for CAT I precision approach supported by Ground Based Augmentation Systems (GBAS) or LPV precision approach supported by Satellite Based Augment Systems (SBAS). Unfortunately, the ionospheric medium is sometimes subject to unpredictable perturbations due to the temporal and spatial variability of the ionospheric plasma. Severe anomalous ionospheric behavior has been discovered in the Conterminous U. S. in April of 2000 and October â November 2003. While severe anomalies occur rarely (per haps 2 â 4 times in 10 years) in mid-latitudes, they can be a serious threat to GNSS integrity. Existing GBAS architectures cannot fully mitigate these effects by monitoring; thus mitigation includes real-time exclusion of potentially unsafe geometries (âgeometry screeningâ) in addition to monitoring. In order to use the proposed mitigation algorithms in different geographical regions, anomalous ionosphere threat models must established for the relevant regions. DLR has defined a model for Germany and nearby regions. These models are implemented in the MASTER GNSS simulator and are used for testing and verification. The Multi-output Advanced Signal Test Environment for Receivers (MASTER) is a unique and powerful hardware simulation tool for testing and quality assessment of global navigation satellite system receivers. At the heart of the system are two modified Spirent GSS 7790 Galileo and GPS constellation simulators which provide all GPS and Galileo satellite signals at RF, IFand digital baseband level. The user has full control over the satellite orbit definitions and over all major effects influencing the quality of real navigation satellite signals: orbit and clock errors, ionosphere, troposphere, multipath, and RF interference. For the verification of differential systems consisting of ground and airborne stations individual but coherent and consistent signals can be generated for both entities. In order to test receivers and GBAS ground system architectures with respect to robustness under the influence of ionospheric irregularities, we developed a comprehensive set of scenarios based upon the threat models mentioned above. In these scenarios, ionospheric âfrontsâ travel across the area in which reference and user receiver ionospheric pierce points are located. These scenarios include âtypicalâ anomalies with pre-selected parameters as well as âworst-caseâ anomalies with parameters (front gradient, speed, width, and direction) which when cause the maximum position error for a given user satellite geometry. In addition to the standard ionospheric front model that applies in mid-latitude regions, we can simulate several types of plasma depletion structures (plasma bubbles) that propagate through the ionosphere. Plasma bubbles result from the gravitational Rayleigh-Taylor instability of the interaction between the charged plasma and the Earthâs magnetic field. At the rising and falling edge of the depletion, strong scintillation can cause GNSS receivers to temporarily lose lock on the satellite and thus degrade user satellite geometries such that approach services may become unavailable. Using the MASTER facility, we will test a simplified GBAS hardware system under typical and worst-case ionospheric conditions. We will compare the results of these tests to the errors predicted for these scenarios by software simulations and the resulting broadcast parameter inflation factors needed for geometry screening. We will present the resulting performance in terms of ionosphere-induced errors, hardware impacts, and the resulting availability of CAT I and future CAT III GBAS...|$|R
