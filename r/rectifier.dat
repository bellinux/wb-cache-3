In 2015, for live shows, the Dual <b>Rectifier</b> was replaced with a Kemper Profiling Amplifier, and the Roland GP-100 was retired in favor of effects in the Fractal Axe-FX.|$|E

5|$|In his preface, Merrifield {{noted that}} while archaeologists {{studying}} prehistoric periods have paid increasing {{attention to the}} evidence for ritual and magic in the archaeological record, their counterparts working in later historical periods have failed to follow their lead. Presenting this book as a <b>rectifier,</b> he outlines his intentions and the study's limitations.|$|E
5000|$|The {{unit has}} 30 VK2-200-6B <b>rectifiers.</b> Every bridge's arm has 3 {{parallel}} circuits, consisting of 10 <b>rectifiers</b> connected in series. The branchings have 3 parallel circuits, with 2 <b>rectifiers</b> connected in series. For even distribution of reverse voltage in serial circuits, the active resistors are {{connected in parallel}} with <b>rectifiers</b> in non-conducting period. The connection of <b>rectifiers</b> with same potential is realized by resistors.|$|R
30|$|Both of {{the input}} line {{currents}} {{of the two}} 12 -pulse <b>rectifiers</b> contains 12 steps, and both of the load voltage of the two 12 -pulse <b>rectifiers</b> contains 12 pulses. Therefore, the two 12 -pulse <b>rectifiers</b> are the same power quality.|$|R
5000|$|Many purpose-designed transformer-rectifier ("Rectiformer") {{units were}} {{specifically}} designed around {{the characteristics of}} metal <b>rectifiers,</b> and substituting silicon <b>rectifiers</b> would necessitate replacing the complete assembly. As {{is the case with}} many other industrial processes, it is often considerably cheaper and more convenient to pay someone to manufacture replacement [...] "legacy" [...] metal <b>rectifiers</b> than to replace the rectiformer. Hence, metal <b>rectifiers</b> are still manufactured in small quantities today.|$|R
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to replace the standard diode-bridge <b>rectifier</b> with a bi-directional IGBT switching device bridge mirroring the standard inverter which uses IGBT switching device output to the motor. Such rectifiers are referred to by various designations including active infeed converter (AIC), active <b>rectifier,</b> IGBT supply unit (ISU), active front end (AFE), or four-quadrant operation. With PWM control and a suitable input reactor, an AFE's AC line current waveform can be nearly sinusoidal. AFE inherently regenerates energy in four-quadrant mode from the DC side to the AC grid. Thus, no braking resistor is needed, and {{the efficiency of the}} drive is improved if the drive is frequently required to brake the motor.|$|E
5|$|The VFD {{controller}} is a solid-state {{power electronics}} conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a <b>rectifier</b> bridge converter, a direct current (DC) link, and an inverter. Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) {{are by far}} {{the most common type of}} drives. Most drives are AC-AC drives in that they convert AC line input to AC inverter output. However, in some applications such as common DC bus or solar applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic <b>rectifier</b> converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, full-wave diode bridge. In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a capacitor which smooths out the converter's DC output ripple and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-sinusoidal AC voltage output using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide higher power factor and lower harmonic distortion than phase-controlled current-source inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a phase converter having single-phase converter input and three-phase inverter output.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} {{has been}} linked with genetic mutations in genes that code for certain ion channels that transport electrolytes (sodium and potassium) across cell membranes. The main ones are the L-type calcium channel α1-subunit and potassium inward <b>rectifier</b> 2.6; it is therefore classified as a channelopathy. The abnormality in the channel is thought to lead to shifts of potassium into cells, under conditions of high thyroxine (thyroid hormone) levels, usually with an additional precipitant.|$|E
25|$|Once common until {{replaced}} by more compact and less costly silicon solid-state <b>rectifiers</b> in the 1970s, these units used stacks of oxide-coated metal plates and {{took advantage of}} the semiconductor properties of selenium or copper oxide. While selenium <b>rectifiers</b> were lighter in weight and used less power than comparable vacuum tube <b>rectifiers,</b> they had the disadvantage of finite life expectancy, increasing resistance with age, and were only suitable to use at low frequencies. Both selenium and copper oxide <b>rectifiers</b> have somewhat better tolerance of momentary voltage transients than silicon <b>rectifiers.</b>|$|R
25|$|Three-phase <b>rectifiers,</b> {{especially}} three-phase full-wave <b>rectifiers,</b> {{have much}} greater conversion ratios because the ripple is intrinsically smaller.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} of Class 85 {{were originally}} fitted with germanium <b>rectifiers</b> which were eventually replaced by silicon <b>rectifiers.</b>|$|R
5|$|Electrical {{generators}} and alternators are frequently used as portable welding power supplies, {{but because of}} lower efficiency and greater costs, they are less frequently used in industry. Maintenance also {{tends to be more}} difficult, because of the complexities of using a combustion engine as a power source. However, in one sense they are simpler: the use of a separate <b>rectifier</b> is unnecessary because they can provide either AC or DC. However, the engine driven units are most practical in field work where the welding often must be done out of doors and in locations where transformer type welders are not usable because there is no power source available to be transformed.|$|E
5|$|With a VFD, the {{stopping}} {{sequence is}} just the opposite as the starting sequence. The frequency and voltage applied to the motor are ramped down at a controlled rate. When the frequency approaches zero, the motor is shut off. A small amount of braking torque is available to help decelerate the load a little faster than it would stop if the motor were simply switched off and allowed to coast. Additional braking torque {{can be obtained by}} adding a braking circuit (resistor controlled by a transistor) to dissipate the braking energy. With a four-quadrant <b>rectifier</b> (active front-end), the VFD is able to brake the load by applying a reverse torque and injecting the energy back to the AC line.|$|E
5|$|Typically, the {{equipment}} used for SMAW {{consists of a}} step-down transformer and for direct current models a <b>rectifier,</b> which converts alternating current into direct current. Because the power normally supplied to the welding machine is high-voltage alternating current, the welding transformer is used to reduce the voltage and increase the current. As a result, instead of 220 V at 50 A, for example, the power supplied by the transformer is around 17–45V at currents up to 600A. A number {{of different types of}} transformers can be used to produce this effect, including multiple coil and inverter machines, with each using a different method to manipulate the welding current. The multiple coil type adjusts the current by either varying the number of turns in the coil (in tap-type transformers) or by varying the distance between the primary and secondary coils (in movable coil or movable core transformers). Inverters, which are smaller and thus more portable, use electronic components to change the current characteristics.|$|E
40|$|Locomotive PWM <b>Rectifiers</b> {{employed}} in A. C traction systems represent several megawatts of electrical load. Typically they use multiple rectifiers/converters in parallel {{in order to}} secure high power ratings and high frequency operation. The <b>rectifiers</b> are supplied from a single-phase A. C. traction transformer with multiple secondaries of high leakage inductance. The switching instants of the PWM <b>rectifiers</b> are phase shifted and interlaced in order to achieve high ripple current cancellation, assuming that the converter loads are balanced. This would ensure the <b>rectifiers</b> to provide better harmonic performance and also redundancy of operation with multiple units in operation. However, in practice, <b>rectifiers</b> may be closely coupled to a tractio...|$|R
50|$|Today, {{insulated}} gate bipolar transistors are typical switching devices. In contrast to diode bridge <b>rectifiers,</b> PWM <b>rectifiers</b> achieve bidirectional power flow.

5|$|While {{harmonics}} in the PWM output {{can easily}} be filtered by carrier-frequency-related filter inductance to supply near-sinusoidal currents to the motor load, the VFD's diode-bridge <b>rectifier</b> converts AC line voltage to DC voltage output by super-imposing non-linear half-phase current pulses thus creating harmonic current distortion, and hence voltage distortion, of the AC line input. When the VFD loads are relatively small {{in comparison to the}} large, stiff power system available from the electric power company, the effects of VFD harmonic distortion of the AC grid can often be within acceptable limits. Furthermore, in low-voltage networks, harmonics caused by single-phase equipment such as computers and TVs are partially cancelled by three-phase diode bridge harmonics because their 5th and 7th harmonics are in counterphase. However, when the proportion of VFD and other non-linear load compared to total load or of non-linear load compared to the stiffness at the AC power supply, or both, is relatively large enough, the load can {{have a negative impact on}} the AC power waveform available to other power company customers in the same grid.|$|E

25|$|A real <b>rectifier</b> {{characteristically}} drops part of {{the input}} voltage (a voltage drop, for silicon devices, of typically 0.7 volts plus an equivalent resistance, in general non-linear)—and at high frequencies, distorts waveforms in other ways.

50|$|Invented in 1902 by Peter Cooper Hewitt, mercury-arc <b>rectifiers</b> {{were used}} to provide power for {{industrial}} motors, electric railways, streetcars, and electric locomotives, {{as well as for}} radio transmitters and for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) power transmission. They were the primary method of high power rectification before the advent of semiconductor <b>rectifiers,</b> such as diodes, thyristors and gate turn-off thyristors (GTOs) in the 1970s.

25|$|These low {{frequencies}} were later made unnecessary by high power locomotive rectifiers that can convert any AC frequency to DC: first the mercury-arc <b>rectifier</b> {{and then the}} semiconductor <b>rectifier.</b> Some AC railways have been converted to standard grid frequencies, but {{low frequencies}} are still widely used due to large sunken equipment costs.|$|E
25|$|For {{single-phase}} AC, if the transformer is center-tapped, {{then two}} diodes back-to-back (cathode-to-cathode or anode-to-anode, depending upon output polarity required) can form a full-wave <b>rectifier.</b> Twice as many turns are required on the transformer secondary {{to obtain the}} same output voltage than for a bridge <b>rectifier,</b> but the power rating is unchanged.|$|E
25|$|A {{variant of}} this is to use two {{capacitors}} in series for the output smoothing on a bridge <b>rectifier</b> then place a switch between the midpoint of those capacitors and one of the AC input terminals. With the switch open, this circuit acts like a normal bridge <b>rectifier.</b> With the switch closed, it act like a voltage doubling <b>rectifier.</b> In other words, this makes it easy to derive a voltage of roughly 320V (±15%, approx.) DC from any 120V or 230V mains supply in the world, this can then be fed into a relatively simple switched-mode power supply. However, for a given desired ripple, the value of both capacitors must be twice the value of the single one required for a normal bridge rectifier; when the switch is closed each one must filter the output of a half-wave <b>rectifier,</b> and when the switch is open the two capacitors are connected in series with an equivalent value of half one of them.|$|E
