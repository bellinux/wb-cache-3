50|$|In Malta, {{second-hand}} imported Japanese vehicles {{must comply}} with <b>Road</b> <b>Worthiness</b> regulations which take care of Emissions, Lights Operability & Mechanical Operability.. Other than that such vehicles can be imported and registered without any problems. Some Maltese importers also apply corrosion protection to these vehicles due to high humidity and heat levels imposed via the weather.|$|E
50|$|The {{single vehicle}} {{approval}} {{is a test}} introduced in 1998 by the British government to determine the <b>road</b> <b>worthiness</b> of a vehicle not otherwise type approved within the UK, on a one off basis. Typically used by 'kit cars', very low volume production vehicles, and personally imported cars, allowing these cars to be used legally on the roads for a reasonable fee.|$|E
50|$|The MOT test (from Ministry of Transport, {{the former}} {{name of the}} Department for Transport) is a {{mandatory}} annual test of safety, <b>road</b> <b>worthiness</b> and exhaust emissions for vehicles over three years old. It is enforced by linking the official MOT database to the payment of Vehicle Excise Duty tax. Prior to November 2014 a tax disc had to be displayed on the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|The Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) Nigeria. Established in 1988, the FRSC is {{the lead}} agency in Nigeria on road safety {{administration}} and management. The statutory functions include: Making the highways safe for motorists and other road users as well as checking <b>road</b> <b>worthiness</b> of vehicles, recommending works and infrastructures to eliminate or minimize accidents on the highways and educating motorists {{and members of the}} public on the importance of road discipline on the highways.|$|E
50|$|Ireland has {{relatively}} loose vehicle importing {{laws for}} Japanese cars. To keep imports down, Irish Revenue Commissioners require all new and imported cars {{to pay the}} VRT. Also, every car, both domestic and imported over four years old must pass the stringent National Car Test (NCT) {{in order to be}} given a <b>road</b> <b>worthiness</b> certificate. In the case of cars imported from Japan, all glass, tyres, noise, must meet EU approved levels.|$|E
50|$|The car {{must be in}} mostly {{original}} and preservation worthy condition. Preservation worthy means a grade C by popular car grading standards. The older the car, the more signs of usage it can show. This purely concerns the cars appearance, the <b>road</b> <b>worthiness</b> is established by separate mandatory safety inspections. Universally accepted modifications include changes that benefit safety, such as seat belts and disc brakes, and environmental friendliness, such as catalytic converters and LPG conversions (if invisible from the outside). Further modifications that are generally accepted are those contemporary of the cars first registration (plus and minus 10 years, burden of proof lies with the owner through historic material such as photographs) and new paintjobs of any color, including two tone paint if originally offered and historic company logos, but no murals or custom patterns.|$|E
50|$|In Russia all {{vehicles}} {{must pass}} a periodic inspection ensuring their <b>road</b> <b>worthiness</b> {{that includes the}} adherence to the respective regulations. To pass the inspection the vehicle must not exceed the mandated emission level (currently Euro-3), the brakes must have no leaks and the brake forces must be symmetrical, steering slip must not exceed the mandated parameters (from 10° for cars to 25° for heavy trucks), all lights must provide the required color, aim and brightness of the emitted light, and the vehicle must be equipped with the first aid kit, fire extinguisher and the emergency stop sign. The windshield must have a functional washer, and while window tinting is allowed, including the blinds on the windshield and rear window, they must pass the required amount of light.|$|E
40|$|Coaches are {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} safest modes of transport for children in the UK. In the last 10 years alone, 1191 children were injured in 371 coach crashes. Though the government has strict regulations to maintain <b>road</b> <b>worthiness</b> of the coaches, operator non-compliance was the major reason for these accidents. In last year alone, 137 coach operator licenses have been revoked due to operator non-compliance in the UK. Currently, there is no process to reliably mitigate the safety risks of children travelling by coaches. This has created a requirement to validate all the coach operators before using their coaches for school trips. This paper proposes a novel safety model for validation of coach operators prior to commencement of coach journeys...|$|E
3000|$|For a given {{city with}} R regions (known as meshblocks or census regions), {{we aim to}} {{identify}} the regions where {{a certain type of}} crime event will happen in the next time interval. Several types of crime event are studied including Theft, Unlawful Entry, Drug Offence, Traffic Related Offence, Fraud, and Assault. The criminal offence which includes the illegal taking of other persons belonging without consent to permanently or temporarily deprive the owner is defined as Theft. When a person enters a building (e.g. office, bank, shop etc.) with an intention to commit crime can be classified as Unlawful Entry. Drug Offence includes any form of sale, dealing, importing or exporting, manufacture or cultivation of illegal drugs or other substances. The offences which are related to most forms of road traffic, including pertaining to the licensing, registration, <b>road</b> <b>worthiness</b> or use of vehicles, bicycle offences, and pedestrian offences can be classified as Traffic Related Offence.

40|$|The Law No. 22 / 2009 on Road Traffic and Transportation {{dictates}} {{the national}} road authorities to perform proactively, reactively, and with fullest anticipation {{with regards to}} the safety aspects in administering road provision. In relation to this demand, data collection was conducted in Provinces of Riau, East Java, South Kalimantan, South Sulawesi, and East Nusa Tenggara through a series of focussed discusions involving road authorities, road traffic and transportation regulators, as well as law enforcement officers. Proactive measures that still fell short to meet the demand were related to Article 8 (stipulation of road 2 ̆ 7 s level of service, optimized utilization of road segments, geometric betterment of roads and intersections, stipulation of road classes, and attainment of <b>road</b> <b>worthiness).</b> Reactive measures that still lag in enforcement were related to Article 24 (improvement of road sections with safety deficiencies, and installation of road signs at damaged road sections or roads with substandard geometric to prevent accidents). Anticipative measures in need of attention were related to Article 230 (road unworthiness as a contributing factor to cause accidents), and Article 273 (poor road conditions that might cause accidents, and in consequence of which, road authorities could face 5 year imprisonment in cases invloving fatalities) ...|$|E

40|$|Biodiesel {{is one of}} {{the fast}} growing {{alternative}} fuels for diesel engines in the world with yearly consumption exceeds 300 million gallon. In 2000, the Hong Kong SAR Government has commissioned the University of Hong Kong to conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the performance of biodiesel on in-service diesel-powered vehicles in Hong Kong and to compare the results with those using ultra low sulphur diesel (50 ppm sulphur) currently used in Hong Kong. Three types of biodiesel fuels were tested with different biodiesel/ULSD blending ratios. The whole study comprised of two parts, namely, a chassis dynamometer exhaust emission test (NOx, CO and HC 1) and a diesel lug down test for each of the vehicle tested. The result of the test is positive and confirms the environmental benefit of using biodiesel fuel. However, a very slight increased in NOx concentration is reported. During the course of the study, some issues related to the durability and fuel hoses compatibility have been raised that may affect the <b>road</b> <b>worthiness</b> of vehicles. In order to assess the compatibility of the rubber fuel hoses with biodiesel, a fuel hose compatibility test was performed to study the characteristics of fuel hoses subjected to fuels with different biodiesel percentages and with different durations. Result of the test leads to some recommendations on the use of special fuel hoses for biodiesel fuel. A one-year durability test on three vehicles using biodiesel was carried out to observe the long term effect of biodiesel on vehicles. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
