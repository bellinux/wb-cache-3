40|$|This study {{examines}} discrimination of Arabic-named applicants in online <b>recruitment</b> <b>procedures</b> in the Netherlands. We {{develop and implement}} a new field experiment approach, posting fictitious resumes (n = 636) on two online resume databases. Two phases of <b>recruitment</b> <b>procedures</b> are examined: employers' decisions to (1) view applicants' complete resumes after seeing short profiles and (2) contact applicants. The experiment covers {{both male and female}} applicants, three occupational levels, five sectors, and ten geographical regions, and consists of two waves. Results provide strong evidence of discrimination in the first phase (views). Resumes of Arabic-named applicants were requested less often, regardless of their education, gender, age, region, or sector, and for both websites and waves. Controlling for the number of times candidates' full resumes were viewed, there is less evidence of discrimination in the second phase (reactions). Yet, after two phases, the cumulative ethnic difference is considerable: Dutch-named applicants are 60 percent more likely to receive a positive reaction than Arabic-named applicants. We conclude that ethnic disparities in outcomes of <b>recruitment</b> <b>procedures</b> are substantial and arise already in the very first phase of the selection process. Hence, employers often do not even get to see Arabic-named applicants' resumes. Finally, discrimination is stronger in wave two, when the total number of views of resumes was lower, indicating lower labor demand...|$|R

Individualizing the lung <b>recruitment</b> <b>procedure</b> to the severity of lung disease of each patient might reduce these risks. In this prospective cohort study, we evaluated chest X-ray (CXR) characteristics during individualized oxygenation-guided lung recruitment with HFV in preterm infants with RDS, before and after surfactant therapy. Two pediatric radiologists scored radiolucency, the presence of lung hyperinflation, and/or air leaks following lung recruitment during HFV in 69 infants before and 39 infants after surfactant treatment. Following lung recruitment, the median radiolucency score was 2, with 44 (64 %) infants having a score ≤ 2. Only mild to moderate hyperinflation was seen in 13 (19 %) infants, with no air leaks. After the surfactant, the radiolucency score improved in 62 % of 39 paired CXRs (p[*] <[*] 0. 001). Mild to moderate hyperinflation was seen in nine (24 %) patients. During the entire admission, only four (6 %) of the patients developed air leaks.
