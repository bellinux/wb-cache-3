5|$|A {{county council}} for the East <b>Riding</b> of Yorkshire {{was set up}} in 1889, {{covering}} an administrative county which did not cover the county borough of Hull, but otherwise had the same boundaries as the historic <b>riding.</b> Both the administrative county and the historic Lieutenancy were abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, on 1 April 1974, with most of the <b>riding</b> going to form the northern part of Humberside. The creation of this cross-Humber authority was unpopular and this culminated in the local government review in the 1990s, which saw Humberside abolished and the northern part form two unitary authorities. The East <b>Riding</b> district was formed on 1 April 1996. The ceremonial county, the area in which the Lord Lieutenant of the East <b>Riding</b> of Yorkshire represents the Crown, was re-established the same day, covering Hull as well as the district.|$|E

5|$|Finnhorses {{are popular}} as {{recreational}} <b>riding</b> horses, and well-suited for use at <b>riding</b> schools, trekking, and <b>riding</b> therapy.

They are also competitive in many disciplines, and in the 1970s separate competition classes for Finnhorses were established at horse shows, which also helped to increase {{the popularity of the}} breed. While in eventing and horse racing, Finnhorses are too slow to compete directly against Thoroughbreds and the sport horse breeds, they are a highly reliable mount for cross-country <b>riding,</b> particularly over difficult terrain; during the Continuation War, the breed successfully crossed any wetland with which it was confronted. In endurance <b>riding.</b> Uusi-Helinä, ridden by Ritva Lampinen, successfully finished the endurance <b>riding</b> world championship competition in Stockholm, Sweden in 1990, finishing 28th.|$|E
