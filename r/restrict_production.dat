50|$|The {{problem here}} is that {{increasing}} competition in this market is likely to increase production (since monopolists <b>restrict</b> <b>production).</b> Because pollution is highly associated with production, pollution will most likely increase.

In 1920, there were 260 pálinka distilleries in Hungary, a figure that grew to 1,070 in 1970 before falling back down to 815 in 1982.

50|$|The project {{differed}} {{from most of}} the others in using several welded steel plate sections in addition to cast armour.

At the same time international tensions continued to rise; to have a modern type ready for introduction seemed a matter of simple precaution.

S. 492-93 and n. 15:The {{legislative}} {{history of the}} Sherman Act, {{as well as the}} decisions of this Court interpreting it, show that it was not aimed at policing interstate transportation or movement of goods and property. The {{legislative history}} and the voluminous literature which was generated {{in the course of the}} enactment and during fifty years of litigation of the Sherman Act give no hint that such was its purpose. They do not suggest that, in general, state laws or law enforcement machinery were inadequate to prevent local obstructions or interferences with interstate transportation, or presented any problem requiring the interposition of federal authority. In 1890, when the Sherman Act was adopted, there were only a few federal statutes imposing penalties for obstructing or misusing interstate transportation. With an expanding commerce, many others have since been enacted safeguarding transportation in interstate commerce as the need was seen, including statutes declaring conspiracies to interfere or actual interference with interstate commerce by violence or threats of violence to be felonies. The law was enacted in the era of [...] "trusts" [...] and of [...] "combinations" [...] of businesses and of capital organized and directed to control of the market by suppression of competition in the marketing of goods and services, the monopolistic tendency of which had become a matter of public concern. The goal was to prevent restraints of free competition in business and commercial transactions which tended to <b>restrict</b> <b>production,</b> raise prices, or otherwise control the market to the detriment of purchasers or consumers of goods and services, all of which had come to be regarded as a special form of public injury. For that reason the phrase [...] "restraint of trade," [...] which, as will presently appear, had a well understood meaning in common law, was made the means of defining the activities prohibited. The addition of the words [...] "or commerce among the several States" [...] was not an additional kind of restraint to be prohibited by the Sherman Act, but was the means used to relate the prohibited restraint of trade to interstate commerce for constitutional purposes, Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers v. United States, 286 U. S. 427, 286 U. S. 434, so that Congress, through its commerce power, might suppress and penalize restraints on the competitive system which involved or affected interstate commerce. Because many forms of restraint upon commercial competition extended across state lines so as to make regulation by state action difficult or impossible, Congress enacted the Sherman Act, 21 Cong.Rec. 2456. It was in this sense of preventing restraints on commercial competition that Congress exercised [...] "all the power it possessed." [...] Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers v. United States, supra, 286 U.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{explanation}} for the prominent role of manufacturers in the financing of their own product sales — so called “captive finance. ” By lending against their own product as collateral, durable goods manufacturers with market power can commit to <b>restrict</b> <b>production</b> and maintain resale values in future periods, preserving rents today. Using data on captive financing support by the manufacturers of heavy equipment, we find evidence that captive financed models retain higher resale values, especially when the manufacturer has pricing power. The higher resale values enjoyed by captive financed models also convey higher pledgeability and thus allow lower downpayments, even when machines are financed by banks. We find that models with a history of captive support are preferred by buyers when financing constraints are binding. Although motivated as a rent-seeking device, captive financing may generate positive spillovers if credit constraints are important...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFlaviviruses {{have evolved}} means to evade host innate immune responses. Recent {{evidence}} suggests {{this is due}} to prevention of interferon production and signaling in flavivirus-infected cells. Here we show that the interferon-induced MxA protein can sequester the West Nile virus strain Kunjin virus (WNVKUN) capsid protein in cytoplasmic tubular structures in an expression-replication system. This sequestering resulted in reduced titers of secreted WNVKUN particles. We show by electron microscopy, tomography and 3 D modeling that these cytoplasmic tubular structures form organized bundles. Additionally we show that recombinant ER-targeted MxA can <b>restrict</b> <b>production</b> of infectious WNVKUN under conditions of virus infection. Our results indicate a co-ordinated and compartmentalized WNVKUN assembly process may prevent recognition of viral components by MxA, particularly the capsid protein. This recognition can be exploited if MxA is targeted to intracellular sites of WNVKUN assembly. This results in further understanding of the mechanisms of flavivirus evasion from the immune system...|$|E
40|$|Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are novel anticancer {{agents that}} combine direct cancer cell killing with the {{stimulation}} of antitumor immunity. In addition, OVs can be engineered to deliver biological therapeutics directly to tumors, offering unique opportunities to design multimodal anticancer strategies. Here, {{a case for}} arming OVs with bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs) is put forward. BiTEs redirect the cytotoxicity of polyclonal T cells to target cells of choice, and have demonstrated efficacy against a number of hematological cancers. However, the success of BiTEs {{in the treatment of}} solid tumors appears more limited, at least in part due to: (i) poor delivery kinetics and penetration into tumors, and (ii) on-target off-tumor activity, leading to dose-limiting toxicities. Linking the production of BiTEs to OV replication provides an exciting means to <b>restrict</b> <b>production</b> to the tumor site, widen their therapeutic window, and synergize with direct oncolysis.
