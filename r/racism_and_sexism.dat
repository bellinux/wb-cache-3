When he attended the University of Leeds as a visiting undergraduate, he organized weekly demonstrations outside a Bradford dance hall which refused to admit black people. Gould continued these demonstrations until the policy was revoked.

25|$|Weapons of Choice {{has been}} both hailed and criticized {{by members of the}} {{alternative}} history community. Some believe it to over-emphasize the <b>racism</b> <b>and</b> <b>sexism</b> of the 1942 Allies, to the point of their being barely morally superior to the Axis. However, this sentiment continues to hold sway amongst significant portions of the historical community.|$|E
50|$|The Workers Organisation for Socialist Action (WOSA) was a Trotskyist {{political}} party in South Africa.

25|$|The Gay Liberation Front (GLF) {{advocated}} for sexual liberation for all people; they believed heterosexuality was {{a remnant of}} cultural inhibition and felt that change would not come about unless the current social institutions were dismantled and rebuilt without defined sexual roles. To do this, the GLF was intent on transforming {{the idea of the}} nuclear family and making it more akin to a loose affiliation of members without biological subtexts. Prominent members of the GLF also opposed and addressed other social inequalities between the years of 1969 to 1972 such as militarism, <b>racism,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sexism,</b> but because of internal rivalries the GLF officially ended its operations in 1972.|$|E

[...] The Third World Women's Alliance stressed the ideological connections between capitalist exploitation, global imperialism, and oppression of women of color.|$|R
500|$|At {{the front}} of the Civil Rights Movement, {{alongside}} such leaders as Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rosa Parks, but lesser known, was Pauli Murray, an outspoken woman who protested {{discrimination on the basis of}} race and sex. She coined the term [...] "Jane Crow", which demonstrated Murray's belief that Jim Crow laws also negatively affected African-American women. She was determined to work with other activists to put a halt to both <b>racism</b> <b>and</b> <b>sexism.</b> Murray's speech, [...] "Jim Crow and Jane Crow", delivered in Washington, D.C. in 1964, sheds light on the long struggle of African-American women for racial equality and their later fight for equality among the sexes. Pauli Murray ultimately helped advance the American Civil Rights Movement by letting her audience know that women's rights were just as important as civil rights.|$|E
500|$|In 1992, an Alabama {{editorial}} {{called for}} the death of Atticus, saying that as liberal as Atticus was, he still worked within a system of institutionalized <b>racism</b> <b>and</b> <b>sexism</b> and should not be revered. The editorial sparked a flurry of responses from attorneys who entered the profession because of him and esteemed him as a hero. Critics of Atticus maintain he is morally ambiguous and does not use his legal skills to challenge the racist status quo in Maycomb. However, in 1997, the Alabama State Bar erected a monument to Atticus in Monroeville, marking his existence as the [...] "first commemorative milestone in the state's judicial history". In 2008, Lee herself received an honorary special membership to the Alabama State Bar for creating Atticus who [...] "has become the personification of the exemplary lawyer in serving the legal needs of the poor".|$|E
500|$|In the 1970s, Ono and Lennon became {{close to}} many radical, {{counterculture}} leaders, including Bobby Seale, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Michael X, John Sinclair (for whose rally in Michigan they flew to sing Lennon's song [...] "Free John Sinclair" [...] that effectively released the poet from prison), Angela Davis, and street musician David Peel. Friend and Sexual Politics author Kate Millett has said Ono inspired her activism. Ono and Lennon appeared on The Mike Douglas Show, taking over hosting duties for a week. Ono spoke {{at length about}} the evils of <b>racism</b> <b>and</b> <b>sexism.</b> She remained outspoken in her support of feminism, and openly bitter about the racism she had experienced from rock fans, especially in the UK. Her reception within the UK media was not much better. For example, an Esquire article of the period was titled [...] "John Rennon's Excrusive Gloupie" [...] and featured an unflattering David Levine cartoon.|$|E

Nussbaum notes that popular disgust has been used throughout history as a justification for persecution. Drawing upon her earlier work on the relationship between disgust and shame, Nussbaum notes that at various times, <b>racism,</b> antisemitism, <b>and</b> <b>sexism,</b> have all been driven by popular revulsion.|$|R
500|$|Once {{elected in}} 2005, Morales {{increased}} taxation on the hydrocarbon industry to bolster social spending, emphasising projects to combat illiteracy, poverty, <b>racism,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sexism.</b> Vocally criticizing neoliberalism and reducing Bolivia's {{dependence on the}} World Bank and International Monetary Fund, his administration oversaw strong economic growth while following a policy termed [...] "Evonomics" [...] which sought to move from a liberal economic approach to a mixed economy. Scaling back U.S. influence in the country, he built relationships with leftist governments in the Latin American pink tide and signed Bolivia into the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas. Attempting to moderate the left-indigenous activist community, his administration also opposed the right-wing autonomist demands of Bolivia's eastern provinces. Winning a recall referendum in 2008, he instituted a new constitution that established Bolivia as a plurinational state and was re-elected in 2009. His second term witnessed the continuation of leftist policies and Bolivia's joining of the Bank of the South and Community of Latin American and Caribbean States. After becoming the world's oldest professional footballer by signing to a Bolivian team, he was again reelected in the 2014 general election.|$|E
2500|$|In 1926, Louis Bolk {{described}} neoteny as {{the major}} process in humanization.

2500|$|Minstrelsy's <b>racism</b> (<b>and</b> <b>sexism)</b> {{could be}} rather vicious. There were comic songs in which blacks were [...] "roasted, fished for, smoked like tobacco, peeled like potatoes, {{planted in the}} soil, or dried up and hung as advertisements", and there were {{multiple}} songs in which a black man accidentally put out a black woman's eyes. On the other hand, {{the fact that the}} minstrel show broached the subjects of slavery and race at all is perhaps more significant than the racist manner in which it did so. Despite these pro-plantation attitudes, minstrelsy was banned in many Southern cities. Its association with the North was such that as secessionist attitudes grew stronger, minstrels on Southern tours became convenient targets of anti-Yankee sentiment.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after the}} {{allegations}} were made, 88 Duke professors (referred to sometimes as the [...] "Group of 88", [...] {{sometimes referred to}} as the [...] "Gang of 88") from the Trinity College of Arts & Sciences placed an ad in The Chronicle referring to the circumstances surrounding the allegations as a [...] "social disaster" [...] and quoting primarily anonymous individuals citing <b>racism</b> <b>and</b> <b>sexism</b> in the Duke community. [...] The advertisement concluded, [...] "We're turning up the volume [...] To the students speaking individually and to the protestors making collective noise, thank you for not waiting and for making yourselves heard," [...] and [...] "These are the students shouting and whispering about what happened to this young woman." [...] Notable signatories included Houston Baker, Miriam Cooke, Anne Allison, Cathy Davidson, Ariel Dorfman, Michael Hardt, Alice Kaplan, Claudia Koonz, Pedro Lasch, Walter Mignolo, Mark Anthony Neal and Alex Rosenberg. The ad was spearheaded by faculty member Wahneema Lubiano.|$|E
2500|$|Some have {{described}} unequal treatment {{of humans and}} animals {{as a form of}} speciesism such as anthropocentrism or human-centeredness. Val Plumwood (1993, 1996) has argued that anthropocentrism plays a role in green theory that is analogous to androcentrism in feminist theory and ethnocentrism in anti-racist theory. Plumwood calls human-centredness [...] "anthropocentrism" [...] to emphasize this parallel. By analogy with <b>racism</b> <b>and</b> <b>sexism,</b> Melanie Joy has dubbed meat-eating [...] "carnism". The animal rights movement seeks an end to the rigid moral and legal distinction drawn between human and non-human animals, an end to the status of animals as property, and an end to their use in the research, food, clothing, and entertainment industries. Peter Singer, in his ethical philosophy of {{what it is to be}} a [...] "person", argues that livestock animals feel enough to deserve better treatment than they receive. Many thinkers have questioned the morality not only of the double standard underlying speciesism but also the double standard underlying the fact that people support treatment of cows, pigs, and chickens that they would never allow with pet dogs, cats, or birds.|$|E
