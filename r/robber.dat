30|$|Simply {{identifying}} other armed <b>robbers</b> as Ghanaians {{and clearly}} naming Fulani armed <b>robbers</b> by their ethnic group name clearly illustrates ethnic labelling {{and the social}} categorization put on all Fulani by Ghanaians (through media discourses). In some instances, <b>robbers</b> disguise themselves as Fulani supposedly speaking and dressing like Fulani because these armed <b>robbers</b> know the public stereotype of Fulani as armed <b>robbers.</b> This cognitive categorization of individual Fulani engaged in armed <b>robbers</b> is used to classify the entire Fulani ethnic group as armed <b>robbers.</b>|$|R

The specific epithet marchei refers to the French explorer and writer Antoine-Alfred Marche, who procured the original specimens.|$|E

5|$|Many dipterans serve {{roles that}} are useful to humans.

40|$|Hummingbird-pollinated flowers {{often have}} their nectar {{extracted}} by nectar <b>robbers</b> {{who do not}} act as pollinators.
