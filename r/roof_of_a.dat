5|$|Apotropaics—items able to {{ward off}} revenants—are common in vampire folklore. Garlic is a common example, a branch of wild rose and {{hawthorn}} plant are said to harm vampires, and in Europe, sprinkling mustard seeds on the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> house was said to keep them away. Other apotropaics include sacred items, for example a crucifix, rosary, or holy water. Vampires {{are said to be}} unable to walk on consecrated ground, such as that of churches or temples, or cross running water.|$|E
5|$|Ballooning was a risky {{business}} for the pioneers. Blanchard lost consciousness on a few occasions, endured freezing temperatures and almost drowned when her balloon crashed in a marsh. In 1819, {{she became the first}} woman to be killed in an aviation accident when, during an exhibition in the Tivoli Gardens in Paris, she launched fireworks that ignited the gas in her balloon. Her craft crashed on the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> house and she fell to her death. She is commonly referred to as Madame Blanchard and is also known by many combinations of her maiden and married names, including Madeleine-Sophie Blanchard, Marie Madeleine-Sophie Blanchard, Marie Sophie Armant and Madeleine-Sophie Armant Blanchard.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} they were ready for their first {{practical}} installation, they heard that one of their members, Girja Sharan, had obtained a grant to construct a dew condenser in Kothara, India. In April 2001, Sharan had incidentally noticed substantial condensation on the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cottage at Toran Beach Resort in the arid coastal region of Kutch, where he was briefly staying. The following year, he investigated the phenomenon more closely and interviewed local people. Financed by the Gujarat Energy Development Agency and the World Bank, Sharan and his team went on to develop passive, radiative condensers for use in the arid coastal region of Kutch. Active commercialisation began in 2006.|$|E

5|$|In Texas, the {{remnants}} of Naomi coupled with a frontal system resulted in prolonged rains over the state. The hardest hit city was Corpus Christi, which reported over 8inches (200mm) of rain {{in relation to the}} disturbance as well as funnel clouds to the south and west of the city, resulting in many roads being stopped to traffic. Accumulated rainfall caused the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tortilla plant to collapse, slightly injuring a worker. Although the range of heavy rains was large, only minor rains were reported in Andrews, Crane, Monahans, Kermit, Wink, Stanton, and Pecos. Despite the totals, the rain proved beneficial as well, helping saturate areas of grassland in need of water.|$|E
5|$|On Friday, 6 July, President General Musharraf {{left for}} the flood-affected areas of Balochistan. As the president's {{aircraft}} took off from the Islamabad airport, militants fired anti-aircraft weapons {{at it from the}} <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> house in the Asghar Mall area of Rawalpindi. The militants' relationship with Lal Masjid remains unknown. Security forces recovered two anti-aircraft guns and a machine gun on the rooftop of a Rawalpindi high-rise, one mile (1.6km) from the airport. The government asserted that shots were heard minutes after the president's aircraft took off. Analysts suggest that it may have been retaliation for ongoing operations against Lal Masjid and the government's continued efforts to combat terrorism and Talibanization in northern Waziristan.|$|E

5|$|Production {{was plagued}} with problems. Bad weather during the {{shooting}} {{was a constant}} source of trouble, and Hitchcock and the crew had an uneasy relationship with the locals. Hitchcock ordered the clearance of snow from a meadow and ordered the local volunteer fire brigade to blast it away, causing the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nearby building to collapse. The mayor demanded compensation of one shilling, but Hitchcock gave the woman who owned the house two shillings to cover the repair work and the inconvenience. Hitchcock offended the locals by refusing to stay at the village inn, and when he was taken ill with altitude sickness, he blamed the sickness on his reaction to the guttural sound of their accents.|$|E
5|$|Upon making landfall, Matthew {{caused a}} storm surge {{of up to}} 5.85feet (1.8m) in Frenier, Louisiana. The storm surge and waves {{resulted}} in significant beach erosion in Grand Isle. Matthew produced heavy rainfall across its path, totaling to 16.23inches (410mm) in Reserve in the southeastern portion of the state. Portions of northwestern Louisiana experienced significant rainfall, including a peak of 18inches (460mm) in Haynesville near the Louisiana/Arkansas border. In addition, Matthew spawned one tornado, causing damage to the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> trailer in Golden Meadow. The rainfall also caused rivers to crest higher than normal, including the Killian River which peaked at 5.7feet (1.7m).|$|E
5|$|Wave heights {{from the}} {{hurricane}} reached 20feet (6m) along coastline portions of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, which washed away 2homes; {{the storm surge}} destroyed 19homes and damaged 40more. On Union Island, the winds damaged the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hospital, while the northern portion of the island sustained heavy damage from the waves. Moderate damage was also reported on Palm Island and Carriacou and Petite Martinique. The winds left {{more than two-thirds of}} the island without power, and also damaged the island's banana crop. Damage in the country totaled $40million (2004USD, ($ USD).|$|E

5|$|Across {{the mountainous}} {{northern}} Barlavento Islands, Fred produced gusty winds and downpours; São Nicolau experienced sustained hurricane-force winds of 80mph (130km/h)—the highest recorded wind speed from the hurricane. Rainfall on that island was moderate, peaking at 3.5in (90mm) at Juncalinho. Many old trees were uprooted, a few landslides took place, and several villages lost power on that island. The strong winds downed power poles and wrecked the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{church in the}} village of Cabeçalinho. In Ribeira Brava, São Nicolau's most populous town, the storm damaged 70homes, destroyed greenhouses, and leveled a farm, leaving several families homeless and others without a source of income. In Carriçal, similar effects were felt as torrential rainfall flooded homes, washed out roads, and ruined fruit and hydroponic crops. Much of São Nicolau's livestock, including cattle from Hortelã, was lost in the storm. Damage to property and agriculturein particular banana and sugarcaneon the island reached CVE$50million ($500,000).|$|E
5|$|As Charley {{moved across}} eastern North Carolina, {{hurricane}} warnings were extended northward, first to Virginia Beach; they were later extended to Cape Charles, {{then to the}} Maryland/Delaware border, and ultimately {{as far north as}} Sandy Hook, New Jersey. Prior to its arrival, the storm resulted in the closure of Norfolk International Airport, and more than 9,000people evacuated the coastline for emergency shelters. Tropical storm force winds spread across southeastern Virginia, with wind gusts reaching 82mph (133km/h) on Cape Charles. Offshore, a station on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel recorded sustained winds of 97mph (157km/h) with gusts to 104mph (168km/h). After the gust, the bridge-tunnel was closed overnight. The winds downed many trees, and in Norfolk, a motorist died after crashing into a downed tree. In Virginia Beach, the winds blew off the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hotel and destroyed two homes under construction. Across the area, the storm left about 110,000customers without power. Rainfall in Virginia was fairly light, including a 24-hour total of just over 1in (25mm) in Norfolk. Strong waves destroyed 250ft (76m) of Harrison's Pier in Norfolk. A preliminary damage estimate for the area was $1million (1986USD).|$|E
5|$|Beginning on December29 and {{continuing}} for three days, the storm system {{associated with the}} tornado outbreak caused strong winds across the Texas Panhandle and eastern New Mexico. The winds were further enhanced by isolated showers, and gusts peaked at 79mph (127km/h) in Tatum, New Mexico. Approximately 7mi (11km) west of Levelland, Texas, the winds downed four power poles, sparking a fire that burned nearly 2,000acres (800hectares) of grassland before it was finally contained; the fire caused US$20,000in damage. In Allen, Oklahoma, strong winds associated with one supercell caused an estimated US$20,000 in damage after damaging the carport, chimney, and <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> house. Hail and strong winds were also reported elsewhere in eastern Oklahoma and southeastern Kansas. Widespread and damaging wind gusts and hail later crossed into northwestern Arkansas, causing US$175,000in damage. Several buildings and homes were destroyed by the strong winds; similar impacts were seen in Missouri and Illinois.|$|E

5|$|Erika {{produced}} light rainfall across southern Texas, peaking at 3.83inches (97mm) in Sabinal, {{though most}} locations reported {{less than two}} inches (50mm) of precipitation. In addition, weather radar estimated isolated accumulations of 4 to 6inches (100 to 150mm) of precipitation in Kenedy and Brooks Counties. Sustained winds from Erika in south Texas peaked at 39mph (62km/h) in Brownsville, where a gust of 47mph (75km/h) was also recorded. Strong waves were reported northwards to Corpus Christi. The storm caused minor flooding and beach erosion along South Padre Island. Strong wind gusts of up to 60mph (95km/h) caused isolated, minor wind damage in south Texas, including in South Padre Island, where the winds damaged the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> business. The winds also uprooted a large tree and caused limb damage to several small- to medium-sized trees in Brownsville. In Texas, damage totaled to $10,000 (2003USD, $ USD).|$|E
5|$|In 1729 {{there was}} an attempt to found a school of {{painting}} in Edinburgh as the Academy of St. Luke, named after the Renaissance Accademia di San Luca in Rome. Its president was George Marshall, a painter of still lives and portraits, and its treasurer was the engraver Richard Cooper. Other members included Cooper's student Robert Strange, the two younger Nories, the portrait painters John Alexander (c. 1690-c. 1733) and Allan Ramsay (1713–84). The success of the group was limited by its associations with Jacobitism, with Strange printing bank notes for the rebels. Alexander was a great grandson of George Jamesone. He studied in London and Rome, returning to Edinburgh about 1720 where he painted the Baroque The Rape of Proserpine, for the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> staircase at Gordon Castle and numerous portraits. Ramsay emerged as the most distinguished alumni of the academy. He studied in Sweden, London and Italy before basing himself in Edinburgh. There he established himself as a leading portrait painter to the Scottish nobility, before moving to London in 1757. He made occasional return visits to Edinburgh to undertake commissions for the nobility and gentry.|$|E
5|$|On October 18, several {{thunderstorms}} {{already developed}} during the morning hours and continued to intensify during the afternoon. Just after 11:00 am EDT, one tornado in downtown Pensacola, Florida caused some extensive damage to the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Baptist church as well as portions of Cordova Mall {{but there were no}} reported injuries at the Church and daycare center. During the early evenings severe weather affected the Louisville, Kentucky Metro area in which tree damage and power outage were reported throughout the area and a possible tornado at around 7:00 pm EDT near the Crescent Hill area which was later confirmed as a brief EF0. Still in the region, one tree fell over a passing car but the motorist escaped injuries although he was trapped for several minutes inside. The Louisville power authority, the LG reported as much as 2,500 homes without power mostly in St. Matthews and Crescent Hill areas. More storms rolled through much of the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys {{during the second half of}} the evening and overnight with more storms in Michigan.|$|E
