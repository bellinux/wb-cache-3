He is best friends with his lab partner Phil, who works with him on almost every project.

25|$|A {{dispatch}} {{officer with}} MacRobertson Miller Aviation observed the aircraft take off normally, then climb {{to an almost}} vertical position, <b>roll</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> dive vertically towards the ground, twisting as it did so. Written evidence from the aerodrome control officer on duty in the control tower stated that he observed the aircraft turn through 180 degrees as though in a spiral turn or spin.|$|E
25|$|During {{the final}} flare to land, the plane {{rolled to the}} right, landed hard on its right main gear and the No. 3 engine touched the runway. The right wing {{separated}} from the fuselage. The aircraft continued to <b>roll</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> skidded off the runway in flames. When it stopped, it was on its back and {{the rear of the}} plane was on fire, coming to rest on a grass area next to the runway, 1,100 m from the runway threshold. The right wing was found on a taxiway 90 meters from the nose of the plane. As shown in photos of the aircraft at rest, the fire caused significant damage to the rear section of the aircraft but was quickly extinguished due to the heavy rain and quick response from rescue teams in the airport.|$|E

500|$|The USAF {{summary report}} of the {{accident}} investigation stated that, given {{the position of the}} F-104 relative to the XB-70, Walker, the F-104 pilot {{would not have been able}} to see the XB-70's wing, except by uncomfortably looking back over his left shoulder. The report said that it was likely that Walker maintained his position by looking at the fuselage of the XB-70, forward of his position. The F-104 was estimated to be [...] to the side of, and [...] below, the fuselage of the XB-70. The report concluded that from that position, without appropriate sight cues, Walker was unable to properly perceive his motion relative to the Valkyrie, leading to his aircraft drifting into contact with the XB-70's wing. The accident investigation also pointed to the wake vortex off the XB-70's right wingtip as the reason for the F-104's sudden <b>roll</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> into the bomber.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with ABC News, sociologist of the University of Alberta, Stephen A. Kent commented, [...] "Historically, Scientology has tried to control what critics say about it. The Internet, however, has posed insurmountable problems regarding control and censorship and Wikipedia's action {{is just one of}} many disputes that have occurred when Internet users have pushed back. Scientology can't <b>roll</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> give up on this issue. It will continue to attempt to have its representation." [...] Evgeny Morozov of Foreign Policy wrote a blog post critical of the Arbitration decision, and stated, [...] "I am no fan of Scientology, but I think that banning them from Wikipedia is going to be counterproductive. Unfortunately, it presents the Wikipedia admins/editors as a non-neutral group that opposes a particular set of ideas." [...] In an August 2010 article in The Guardian, journalists Rachel Shabi and Jemima Kiss observed, [...] "Editors can remain anonymous when changing content, but conflicts are passed to Wikipedia's arbitration committee. Scientology was a regular source of conflict until the committee blocked editing by the movement." ...|$|E

500|$|The range {{had grown}} too far for {{accurate}} shooting, so Beatty altered course four points to port {{to close the}} range again between 16:12 and 16:15. This manoeuvre exposed Lion to the fire of the German battlecruisers, and she was hit several times. The smoke and fumes from these hits caused [...] {{to lose sight of}} Lion, which had sheered out of line to starboard, and to switch her fire to Queen Mary, now visible to Derfflinger's gunnery officer as the second ship in the British line and therefore assumed to be Princess Royal, at 16:16. Queen Mary hit Seydlitz again at 16:17 and knocked out one gun of her secondary armament. In return, Queen Mary had been hit twice by Seydlitz before 16:21 with unknown effects, but the German battlecruiser hit the turret face of 'Q' turret at that time and knocked out the right-hand gun in the turret. By 16:25 the range was down to , and Beatty turned two points to starboard to open the range again. This move came too late, however, for Queen Mary, as Derfflingers fire began to take effect, hitting her twice before 16:26. One shell hit forward and detonated {{one or both of the}} forward magazines, which broke the ship in two near the foremast. Stationed inside 'Q' turret, Midshipman Jocelyn Latham Storey survived and reported that there had been a large explosion forward which rocked the turret, breaking the left gun in half, the gun breech falling into the working chamber and the right gun coming off its trunnions. Cordite in the working chamber caught fire and produced poisonous fumes that asphyxiated some of the turret's crew. It is doubtful that an explosion forward could have done this, so 'Q' turret may have been struck by the second shell. A further explosion, possibly from shells breaking loose, shook the aft end of the ship as it began to <b>roll</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> sink. The battlecruiser behind her, , was showered with debris from the explosion and forced to steer to port to avoid her remains. 1,266 crewmen were lost; eighteen survivors were picked up by the destroyers , , and , and two by the Germans.|$|E

His original name was Big Boy; Roosevelt renamed him Murray the Outlaw of Falahill after John Murray of Falahill, a famous Scottish ancestor. This was later shortened to [...] "Fala".|$|E

2500|$|... "(O'Hare) {{was a great}} swimmer and spear fisherman, and {{he insisted}} that the {{squadron}} swim with him.

If he got hungry, Butch would <b>roll</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> dive, {{and the next thing you}} knew, he would come up with a fish of some sort. Then he'd just <b>roll</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> lie on his back like an otter and eat the thing raw! He really impressed us with that! One day, he came back to the surface with an octopus draped over his arm. He said, 'Now, you have to learn how to kill these things, boys: you bite 'em right behind the eye.' And with that, he chomped down! The octopus has some sort of spinal cord there, and biting it there does kill it! Then we had to go back to the beach where Butch would put these things in a frying pan with a little oil and some salt and stir them around. He enjoyed them, but they tasted like old rubber tires to me!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Prentice John Delaney Jr. (January 8, 1945 â€“ April 13, 2003), {{better known}} as Sean Delaney, was an American musician, producer, road manager and songwriter, {{best known for his}} work with the rock band KISS from the early 1970s until the early 1980s. He is largely {{credited}} with developing their choreography onstage, and co-wrote many songs with Paul Stanley, including [...] "Mr. Speed", [...] "Makin' Love", and [...] "Take Me" [...] from the 1976 album Rock and <b>Roll</b> <b>Over,</b> <b>and</b> [...] "All American Man" [...] from the studio side of the 1977 album Alive II.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the common}} {{misconception}} that the gull-wing doors are mere stylistic affectations, {{the design is}} a very practical one in a tight urban parking space. When properly designed and counterbalanced, they require little side-clearance to open (about 27.5cm, or 11" [...] in the DeLorean) and allow much better entrance/egress than conventional doors. The most obvious downside to having gull-wing doors is that, should the car <b>roll</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> come to rest on its roof, exit by the doors would be impossible, requiring a large windscreen opening to escape. The Mercedes SLS solved this problem by fitting explosive bolts in the hinges, that would blow up {{in the event that}} the car rolls over.|$|E

2500|$|Coal {{producers}} in Montana and 11 out-of-state utilities (including Commonwealth Edison) challenged {{the constitutionality of}} the severance tax, arguing it was invalid under the Commerce and Supremacy Clauses of the U.S. Constitution. The Montana state district court for Lewis and Clark County dismissed the complaint in July 1979. Montana State Attorney General Mike Greely hailed the decision, declaring [...] "Montana will never again <b>roll</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> play dead when big outside interests decide to take our resources." [...] The plaintiffs appealed to the Montana Supreme Court. Additional Midwestern utilities joined the suit, claiming that the state of Montana was acting like OPEC and accusing Montanans of being [...] "blue-eyed Arabs". The Montana Supreme Court upheld the tax's constitutionality on July 17, 1980. The utilities appealed, and the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari in December 1980.|$|E
2500|$|On {{his first}} two runs, Bible was timed at first [...] and then , both below the Triplex Specials {{previous}} best and well short of Golden Arrows standing record.

Bible was thrown from the car, killing him instantly. A PathÃ© newsreel cinema photographer and spectator, Charles Traub, was also killed. Some blame Bible's driving and excessively fast deceleration, others Triplexs lack of stability. There is controversy about both of those deaths, as it is also unclear whether the photographer was in an area expected to be safe, or if he approached the running line too closely in order to get more dramatic footage.|$|E
