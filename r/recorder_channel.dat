2500|$|The captain's cockpit voice <b>recorder</b> <b>channel</b> showed two [...] "dropouts" [...] of {{background}} power harmonics {{in the second}} before the recording ended (with {{the separation of the}} nose). This might well be the signature of an arc on cockpit wiring adjacent to the FQIS wiring. The captain commented on the [...] "crazy" [...] readings of the number 4 engine fuel flow gauge about 21/2 minutes before the CVR recording ended. Finally, the Center Wing Tank fuel quantity gauge was recovered and indicated 640pounds instead of the 300pounds that had been loaded into that tank. Experiments showed that applying power to a wire leading to the fuel quantity gauge can cause the digital display to change by several hundred pounds before the circuit breaker trips. Thus the gauge anomaly could have been caused by a short to the FQIS wiring. The NTSB concluded that the most likely source of sufficient voltage to cause ignition was a short from damaged wiring, or within electrical components of the FQIS. As not all components and wiring were recovered, {{it was not possible to}} pinpoint the source of the necessary voltage.|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 25 - 28, 1999 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaCompiling a PCM {{data frame}} with super {{commutation}} poses problems of maintaining constant sample intervals for the parameters whilst keeping within channel bandwidth limitations. Add an extra requirement of using variable word lengths to optimise {{the use of}} available bit rate and the problem becomes more challenging. The available telemetry or tape <b>recorder</b> <b>channel</b> bandwidth rather than {{the capabilities of the}} data acquisition system normally govern the amount of data that can be acquired by the aircraft instrumentation system. The amount of data demanded usually expands to fill all available bandwidth and the bit rates are operated at the maximum for the particular channel. The use of variable word lengths can, in some circumstances, increase the utilisation of a channel bandwidth. In order to visualise if a particular requirement can be accommodated within a given data structure a method of sketching PCM data frames containing a wide mixture of sample rates using an intermediate matrix has been devised. The method is described in three stages. 1. Compiling a simple PCM frame. 2. Sketching the intermediate matrix to assist in visualising super commutation limits. 3. Mixing variable word lengths and super commutation in the same PCM format. The method is not guaranteed to be the most efficient but does give a relatively simple, non mathematical, way to visualise if the required sample rates can be accommodated in a given data structure. If the requirement will not fit into the data structure then the method allows the impact of the necessary changes to the structure to be rapidly assessed. The paper includes comments on the relevant characteristics needed in the aircraft data acquisition system. These include variable word lengths, frame lengths, incremental bit rates and coherency of multiple data bus word parameter...|$|E

DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Paediatric intensive care unit in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty mechanically ventilated children (mean age 6. 7 years) who met the following inclusion criteria: endotracheal tube with an internal diameter of 4 mm or more (cuffed or uncuffed), mechanical ventilation for an acute disease, no treatment with antiacids, prokinetics, or H 2 -receptor blockers, and no nasogastric or orogastric tube. METHODS: The tracheal antimony pH probe was positioned 1 cm below the distal end of the endotracheal tube. The oesophageal antimony pH probe was positioned at the lower third of the oesophagus. pH was recorded on a double <b>channel</b> <b>recorder</b> and analysed with EsopHogram 5. 01 software and by examination of the trace. The following definitions were used: GOR index, percentage of time pH 4. 8 %; tracheal reflux, fall in tracheal pH 10 % (p < 0. 01) and were more frequent with a maximal inspiratory pressure of < 25 cm H 2 O (p = 0. 03), but were {{not related to the}} indication for mechanical ventilation, whether the endotracheal tube was cuffed or not, age, or drug treatment.

This study was carried out due to the paucity {{of information on the}} clear role of zinc in treatment of hypertension. Plasma electrolytes, hematological parameters and changes in their body weight were assessed. Adult male Wistar rats were used. They were divided into four groups: control, zinc-fed, salt-loaded and salt-loaded-zinc-fed. The control rats were given the standard rat chow, the zinc-fed rats were given the standard rat chow plus zinc sulphate (50 mg/kg/day), the salt-loaded rats were given a diet containing 8 % NaCl and the salt-loaded-zinc-fed rats were given a diet containing 8 %NaCl plus 50 mg/kg/day zinc sulphate supplementation. Rat feed and tap water were given ad libitum for 10 weeks. Blood pressure measurement was done in anaesthetised animals through a direct invasive method using a 2 <b>Channel</b> <b>Recorder</b> Polygraph. Salt loading significantly increased the mean arterial pressure, but zinc sulphate supplementation prevented hypertension in salt-loaded rats. Salt loading also led to increase in hematocrit, number of red blood cells, hemoglobin concentration and the mean corpuscular volume. Zinc supplementation reduced the values of these hemetological parameters. There was also a significant decrease in plasma potassium level and no significant changes in plasma sodium and zinc in salt-loaded rats. Zinc sulphate supplementation prevented the decrease in plasma potassium in salt-loaded rats. Furthermore, high diet led to a low percentage weight gain compared with rats given a normal rat diet, but zinc supplementation reduced the extent of this weight loss during salt loading. These results suggest that zinc has antihypertensive effects associated with maintaining the plasma potassium, number of red blood cell and body weight...|$|R

He has written thirteen books and over eight hundred scientific papers, receiving also several prizes and distinctions. Not only his interests stayed within the academic environment but an industrial hue was manifested in over 20 USA patents, all applied to medical use. History of science and technology was another area in which, often with Hebbel Hoff, he uncovered astounding and delightful information. It is beyond my capability to review everything Les did, least of all what he did during the long span at Purdue. </p...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that mandibular advancement devices (MADs) {{can be an}} effective treatment for some patients with obstructive sleep apnea, a highly prevalent chronic disease. In this study, the objectives were to objectively assess the effectiveness of MAD therapy using a limited <b>channel</b> <b>recorder,</b> and to develop a model for identifying patients who may be appropriate for MAD therapy as the initial treatment option. Thirty patients were prospectively recruited and studied at two independent dentist offices and the participants’ homes. Subjects wore the ARES Unicorder for two nights before insertion of the MAD, and again when the dentist determined that the patient had reached the titration endpoint. Self-reported measures of depression, sleepiness, and quality of life were obtained pre- and posttreatment. The reviewer was blinded to the study status while the physiological signals were being visually inspected. Significant reductions in the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI), hypoxemia measures, and snoring level were observed posttreatment. Twenty-seven of the 30 (90 %) patients had a posttreatment AHI (using a 4 % desaturation for hypopneas) below a clinical cut-off of 10. All but one patient (97 %) exhibited at least a 50 % decrease in AHI or had a posttreatment AHI[*]≤[*] 10. Significant differences in body mass index, weight, and neck circumference in patients with posttreatment AHIs above and below a clinical cut-off of five were identified. The linear regression used to predict the posttreatment AHI using pretreatment data resulted in an R 2 of 0. 68. The model correctly predicted two patients who were unable to obtain a posttreatment AHI of 10 or less. This study was designed to demonstrate two models of collaboration between a dental sleep medicine specialist and a sleep medicine physician in the monitoring of a patient treated with a MAD. The outcome data suggest that the limited channel recording system can be used as an alternative to laboratory polysomnography to reduce the cost of MAD treatment, and to improve the quality and consistency of posttreatment patient care...|$|R
