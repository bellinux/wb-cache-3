5|$|In general, <b>researchers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field {{focus on}} {{development}} of cognitive flexibility {{between the ages}} of three and five. However, cognitive flexibility {{has been shown to be}} a broad concept that can be studied with all different ages and situations. Thus, with tasks ranging from simple to more complex, research suggests that there is a developmental continuum that spans from infancy to adulthood.|$|E

5|$|DNA {{nanotechnology}} is {{the design}} and manufacture of artificial nucleic acid structures for technological uses. In this field, nucleic acids are used as non-biological engineering materials for nanotechnology rather than as the carriers of genetic information in living cells. <b>Researchers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field have created static structures such as two- and three-dimensional crystal lattices, nanotubes, polyhedra, and arbitrary shapes, and functional devices such as molecular machines and DNA computers. The field is beginning {{to be used as}} a tool to solve basic science problems in structural biology and biophysics, including applications in X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of proteins to determine structures. Potential applications in molecular scale electronics and nanomedicine are also being investigated.|$|E

In addition, Keith (Enrico Colantoni) starts investigating Dean O'Dell's (Ed Begley, Jr.) mysterious death.|$|E
5|$|Males {{sexually mature}} {{at the age}} of 15, but do not {{typically}} reproduce until age 21. Wild males live around 29 years on average, with a maximum of about 60 years. One male, known as Old Tom, was reportedly spotted every winter between the 1840s and 1930 off New South Wales, Australia. This would have made him up to 90 years old. Examination of his teeth indicated he died around age 35, but this method of age determination is now believed to be inaccurate for older animals. One male known to <b>researchers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Northwest (identified as J1) was estimated to have been 59 years old when he died in 2010.|$|E

5|$|Research is also {{undertaken}} {{in this field}} of artificial photosynthesis. It {{involves the use of}} nanotechnology to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds, by splitting water to produce hydrogen fuel or then combining with carbon dioxide to make biopolymers such as methanol. Many large national and regional research projects on artificial photosynthesis are now trying to develop techniques integrating improved light capture, quantum coherence methods of electron transfer and cheap catalytic materials that operate under a variety of atmospheric conditions. Senior <b>researchers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field have made the public policy case for a Global Project on Artificial Photosynthesis to address critical energy security and environmental sustainability issues.|$|E
5|$|<b>Researchers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field {{advocate}} a teaching style that incorporates group problem-solving activities and demands higher-level thought. According to this process, a teacher initially poses a single {{question in a}} number of ways. Next, students discuss the problem with the teacher and amongst themselves, asking questions. In forming these questions, students are actively brainstorming and recalling prior knowledge. At this point, the teacher provides specific conditions of the issue discussed, and students must adapt their prior knowledge, along with that of their peers, to generate a solution. Other curriculum designs tailored to young children such as “” incorporate practices which aim to improve students’ capacity to shift and prolong attention as well as think “outside the box” (i.e. generate creative solutions).|$|E
5|$|Sputnik 2 was not {{designed}} to be retrievable, and Laika had always been intended to die. The mission sparked a debate across the globe on the mistreatment of animals and animal testing in general to advance science. In the United Kingdom, the National Canine Defence League called on all dog owners to observe a minute's silence, while the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) received protests even before Radio Moscow had finished announcing the launch. Animal rights groups at the time called on {{members of the public}} to protest at Soviet embassies. Others demonstrated outside the United Nations in New York; nevertheless, laboratory <b>researchers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. offered some support for the Soviets, at least before the news of Laika's death.|$|E

5|$|The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, officially {{known as}} The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel (Swedish: Sveriges riksbanks pris i ekonomisk vetenskap till Alfred Nobels minne), is awarded {{annually}} by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to <b>researchers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field of economic sciences. The first prize was awarded in 1969 to Ragnar Frisch and Jan Tinbergen. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award that has varied throughout the years. In 1969, Frisch and Tinbergen {{were given a}} combined 375,000 SEK, which is equivalent to 2,871,041 SEK in December 2007. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the Hall Institute was in {{the early}} stages of rapid expansion. The new {{director}} of the Institute, Charles Kellaway, wanted to increase the activities of the organisation to not only support hospital operations but have separate research groups in physiology, microbiology and biochemistry that would also do independent studies. He also hoped to raise the standards to make the Institute comparable to the world-class operations in Europe and America. Kellaway took a liking to Burnet and saw him as the best young talent in the Institute with the ability to help raise it to world leading standards. However, he thought that Burnet would need experience working in a laboratory in England before he could lead his own research group on bacteriology in Australia. Burnet left Australia for England in 1925 and served as ship's surgeon during his journey in exchange for a free fare. On arrival, he took a paid position assisting the curator of the National Collection of Type Cultures at the Lister Institute in London. Burnet prepared or maintained bacteria cultures for other <b>researchers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning and was free to do his own experiments in the afternoon. During the latter half of 1926, he experimented to see if Salmonella typhimurium was affected by bacteriophage.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{from the}} 1940s, {{lanthanum}} {{has been placed}} under scandium and yttrium in group 3 of the periodic table, as its differentiating electron from the previous element goes into a d-orbital. This results in a consistent set of electron configurations in group 3 (Sc: 3d14s2; Y: 4d15s2; La: 5d16s2). However, this position has sometimes been disputed, {{on the grounds that}} yttrium {{and to a lesser extent}} scandium are closer in their chemical properties to lutetium than lanthanum. Indeed, early techniques on separating the rare earths relied on the distinction between the early lanthanides in the cerium group (whose sodium double sulfates dissolve in water with difficulty) and the late ones (as well as yttrium) in the yttrium group (whose sodium double sulfates are very water-soluble), prompting some <b>researchers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1920s and 1930s to place lutetium under yttrium instead. Since the differentiating electron between ytterbium and lutetium also goes into a d-orbital, both lutetium and lanthanum appear by this argument as equally valid candidates for being the third member of group 3.|$|E

25|$|At 37%, {{the share}} of female <b>researchers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Arab States compares well with other regions.
