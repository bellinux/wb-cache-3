5|$|As {{teacher and}} player, Byard was renowned for his {{knowledge}} of the history of jazz piano. This meant that some aspiring young musicians sought him out as a teacher. One of these was pianist Jason Moran, who described their first meeting, at a performance by the Apollo Stompers: Jaki had all these toys and whistles and bells and things that he was playing from the piano, and also screaming and yelling from the piano in joy. I <b>remember</b> <b>thinking,</b> 'This guy's out of his mind.' After the set, I went up to him, introduced myself, and said that I would be studying with him. He said something to the effect of, 'get ready'. Moran studied with Byard for four years, and credits the older man with developing his skills, building his awareness of jazz history, and creating his willingness to experiment with different styles. Another student, Fred Hersch, reported that Byard was both organized and chaotic as a teacher: giving his students worksheets and having them study early stride piano, but also behaving eccentrically and missing lessons. Classical composer Bruce Wolosoff was taught by Byard at the New England Conservatory and counts him as an important influence.|$|E

In fact, I'm going to sing for that band! I know I'm going to sing for that band!' ... I just thought, 'This is really me. Not Samson.'" ...|$|E

This is the episode I get {{to get out}} of the lab. I <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> I can't wait to see what the set's going to look like and how they will make it look when the spontaneous combusting takes place. And we get there and it's just smoke on the walls, like a kitchen fire. I thought that was so funny because I thought there were going to be body parts everywhere, like a small explosion. But it's a really good episode, which leads you into the coolest parts of the finale episode." ...|$|E

Kenny called Bumpass [...] "brilliant" [...] and said, [...] " [...] {{is sort of}} like Squidward". Staff writer Kent Osborne said, [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> about how much Rodger talks and acts like Squidward. That's why it's such a good voice—he's so connected to it". However, Bumpass said, [...] "I'm not him and he's not me, but what I'm required to do for him and what I am enabled to do for him is what makes it like me. It fits my particular talents and skills very well. So in that respect, yeah, he is me, but I am not the cranky, sarcastic, underachieving kind of guy that he is. He's easy to fall in, I will say that." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" [...] {{features}} guest appearances {{from several}} actors and actresses, including Rosemarie DeWitt (as Midge) and Maggie Siff (as Rachel Menken). DeWitt {{was given a}} recurring role in the season as Don's mistress, which lasted for six episodes. She initially felt out of place while playing out her character. DeWitt stated, [...] "They were {{at the end of}} casting, and hadn't found the right Midge yet. Originally they had a scene where she opens the door wearing a red kimono, and I <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> 'I'm not that', so I wasn’t sure I was right for the part. Maybe the fact that I wasn't this 'vamp' is what made Matt Weiner give me a shot." [...] Prior to working on Mad Men, Siff mainly worked in theatre and performing arts.|$|E
500|$|Davey was {{initially}} uncomfortable with being {{described as a}} singer-songwriter but is now more accepting of the term. She describes her songwriting style: I write in short quick spurts of manic creativity, which are followed by spells of borderline writer's block where the writing comes really painfully and laboriously. I’m sure it's a universal experience for anyone who writes, but it's difficult to get out of, you can't just wish it away—it just disappears when it's had enough. It’s completely independent of whether I’m happy or blue, up or down. It tends to lift as soon as I stop fixating on it—I <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> my house was the problem, and I'd {{need to go to}} France in order to write, and I would have been scared without Rex [...] I got through it.

[...] We talked about it a little bit, and nobody had any ideas. Finally, I got an idea. We'll do a stunt. We'll go around the world from North Pole to South Pole. That was my brainstorm. If {{you take a look at}} a map of the world, you'll see that's not a very easy way to go. [...] So we didn't do that. But I do <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> of it.

500|$|In a 1995 interview, Guitar World writer Jeff Gilbert {{described}} Vitalogy as [...] "strange" [...] and [...] "very eclectic."

During this period Vedder began to contribute in a large capacity as a guitarist. Gossard said, [...] "Vitalogy {{is the first one}} where Ed plays guitar and he wrote three to four songs. I <b>remember</b> <b>thinking,</b> 'This is so different. Is anyone going to like this?'...It had a more punk feel to it. Simple songs recorded really quickly." [...] The album has a notable lack of guitar solos compared with the band's first two albums. McCready said, [...] "Vitalogy is not really a 'solo' album. I don't think the songs demanded solos; {{it was more of a}} rhythmic album." ...|$|E

So I wrote him this idea of a federale from Mexico who gets hired to do hatchet jobs in the U.S. I had heard {{sometimes}} FBI or DEA have a really tough job that they don't {{want to get their}} own agents killed on, they'll hire an agent from Mexico to come do the job for $25,000. I thought, 'That's Machete. He would come and do a really dangerous job for {{a lot of money to}} him but for everyone else over here it's peanuts.' But I never got around to making it."

Ament said, [...] "When we made Vs., our second record, I <b>remember</b> <b>thinking,</b> 'Man, I wish our first record sounded like this.' I thought it was more direct, more powerful." [...] Besides the heavier songs, the album features two acoustic ballads in [...] "Daughter" [...] and [...] "Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town".

McCready stated that it wasn't that the band [...] "sat down and decided to be funky," [...] but rather {{it came from the}} band [...] "exploring different directions and combining our influences."

500|$|When {{writing the}} script, Arndt chose the Volkswagen T2 Microbus {{to use for}} the road trip based on his {{experience}} with the vehicle and its practicality for filming: [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>thinking,</b> it's a road trip, what vehicle {{are you going to}} put them in? And [...] VW bus just seems logical, just because you have these high ceilings and these clean sight lines where you can put the camera. In the front windshield looking back and seeing everybody." [...] Five VW Microbuses were used for the family car as some were modified for different filming techniques. Three of the vans had engines, and the two without were mounted on trailers. During pre-production, the cinematographer used a basic video camera and set it up at angles inside the van to determine the best locations to shoot from during filming. Many of the problems associated with the van that were included in the plot (a broken clutch, a stuck horn, and a detached door), were based on similar problems that writer Arndt experienced during a childhood trip that involved the same type of vehicle.|$|E

[...] The next track, [...] "Da Art of Storytellin' (Part 2)", is an apocalyptic song that represents the group's vision of [...] "the last song recorded in the world", with André 3000 commenting, [...] "I do <b>remember</b> <b>thinking,</b> 'What if it was the end of the world and we had to get to the Dungeon on some X-Men superhero shit.

[...] Upon meeting Guetta, she asked him for the song so she could write its lyrics. [...] "So I met David and asked him for the track...

[...] The song reached Cyrus while she was creating an EP with Dr. Luke. The writing team then reworked the lyrics, intending to write an accompanying theme for Cyrus' joint clothing line with Max Azria, exclusively sold in Wal-Mart stores. In order to please audiences, Dr. Luke, Kelly and Jessie J fixated on composing a fun, upbeat song that narrated reflections of Cyrus' personality.

To write his contributions to the song, Kelly said he desired to mimic Cyrus' songwriting: [...] "It's the same song from a different point of view, you just have to find that unique perspective." [...] To record the song's instrumentation, they decided to mingle computerized sound with [...] "the warmth of live instrumentation", using live electric guitars and drums. Cyrus was pleased with the song and selected it partially due to a need of tracks for The Time of Our Lives. This is the first of two collaborations between Dr. Luke and Cyrus.
