30|$|In the {{mechanical}} part, the float moves {{up and down}} driven by waves, pulling pulley 2 and pulley 3 to rotate in opposite directions. During the wave falling period, only pulley 2, <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheel</b> 1 and driving pulley 4 work to drive the driving pulley 6. If the rotating speed of pulley 2 is {{equal to that of}} driving pulley 4 and the wave keeps falling, the connection between pulley 2 and driving pulley 4 is maintained by <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheel</b> 1. Similarly, during the wave rising period, only pulley 3, <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheel</b> 2 and driving pulley 5 work to drive the driving pulley 6. When pulley 3 keeps pace with driving pulley 5 through <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheel</b> 2 and the driving force is continually on pulley 3, the SRG rotating speed will increase. Through this process, the wave energy is captured and converted into mechanical energy. One thing to be noted is that two <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheels</b> ensure the rotor of SRG rotates in single direction during the whole process. The torque applied on the rotor is always negative, whether wave rises or falls. The work efficiency is greatly improved, compared with that of a single-direction driven float-type wave power system, which works only when the wave is rising, or only when it is falling.|$|R

Exposed is a constructive solution of portable traction augmenter with the weight distribution and corresponding auxiliary traction distribution between <b>wheel</b> <b>drivers.</b> The research aim consisted in designing a portable traction augmenter maintaining the weight distribution between <b>wheel</b> <b>drivers.</b> The researched problem relates to revealing the relation between the wheel drivers’ trailing weight distribution and the tangential traction arising when these <b>wheel</b> <b>drivers</b> are rolling along the supporting surface. The considered questions can be used for wheel drivers’ optimal loading with tangential traction and consecutive efficiency improving. The obtained structural design solutions for a portable traction augmenter with distributed weight moving along the supporting surface on pneumatic tires, when tire deformation work takes place opposing to the resistance force can be used to calculate wheel drivers’ quality factors...|$|R

5000|$|In 1843 Matthäus Hipp first {{mentioned}} a purely mechanical clock {{being driven by}} a switch called [...] "echappement à palette". A varied version of that escapement has been used from the 1860s inside electrically driven pendulum clocks, the so-called [...] "hipp-toggle". Since the 1870s in an improved version the pendulum drove a <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheel</b> via a pawl on the pendulum rod, and the <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheel</b> drove {{the rest of the}} clock train to indicate the time. The pendulum was not impelled on every swing or even at a set interval of time. It was only impelled when its arc of swing had decayed below a certain level. As well as the counting pawl, the pendulum carried a small vane, known as a Hipp's toggle, pivoted at the top, which was completely free to swing. It was placed so that it dragged across a triangular polished block with a vee-groove in the top of it. When the arc of swing of the pendulum was large enough, the vane crossed the groove and swung free on the other side. If the arc was too small the vane never left {{the far side of the}} groove, and when the pendulum swung back it pushed the block strongly downwards. The block carried a contact which completed the circuit to the electromagnet which impelled the pendulum. The pendulum was only impelled as required.|$|R

50|$|The warp {{passes from}} the warp beam, passes over a {{friction}} guide roller, where it horizontally {{passes through the}} loom to a breastbeam. Here it turns vertically to the cloth beam. Even tension is essential as any variation will lead to broken threads. As the warp beam empties its effective diameter changes making the warp slacker- tension is maintained by adding a wooden pulley to the beam, around which are two turns of rope that are attached to mill weights- thus retarding the beam through friction. The cloth beam bears a toothed wheel which works a pinion. A <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheel</b> is attached with a click level {{to take up the}} slack in the cloth. This was Roberts invention.|$|R
50|$|Sound waves {{entering}} a mouthpiece and falling on a diaphragm were conveyed by {{a piece of}} rubber tubing and a spring to a pawl, which vibrated against a very fine-toothed <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheel.</b> The diaphragm and mouthpiece {{were similar to those}} used on the phonograph.

The speed of rotation depended on the pitch of the sound. It was able to operate a small drill or saw which could bore or cut wood. When a long sustained sound got the flywheel up to an appreciable speed, considerable force was required to stop it.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, a {{bidirectional}} driven float-type {{wave power}} generation system with a SRG is proposed. Two <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheels</b> are equipped, and the driving pulley 6 can rotate the SRG rotor in one direction. With this design, the modified WEC can always convert wave energy to mechanical energy, whether the float rises or falls. Then the captured energy is transformed into electrical energy. From the mechanical perspective this improves the generating efficiency. Also, the float can be controlled {{to keep pace with the}} wave when a suitable current reference value is set according to the wave conditions. This achieves maximum power point tracking and the generating efficiency is further improved. A simulation model is developed to verify the electrical energy generation ability of this WEC design and to demonstrate the feasibility of applying SRG in a wave {{power generation system}}.|$|R
50|$|Gas handgun {{magazines}} usually contain 10 to 30 pellets in {{a standard}} capacity magazine; however, some are high capacity magazines and can hold 50 rounds or more. In the case of AEG rifles, magazines come in either real-capacity (equivalent to the capacity of its real steel counterpart), low-capacity (10-50 rounds), mid-capacity (75-160 rounds), or high-capacity (190+ rounds). These magazines are spring-loaded. The high-cap magazines often have a <b>ratchet</b> <b>wheel</b> that can be wound up periodically to force pellets up from the holding chamber of the magazine to the feeding chute. Due to loose pellets in the reservoir, they often make a rattling noise when running or walking. Some airsoft guns have a battery-powered box or drum magazine that holds thousands of pellets, but these are usually only used and allowed on LMGs (light machine gun)type replicas.|$|R
