5|$|During the Great Turkish War (1683–1698), Slavonia was regained but western Bosnia, {{which had}} been part of Croatia before the Ottoman conquest, {{remained}} outside Croatian control. The present-day border between the two countries is a <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> this outcome. Dalmatia, {{the southern part of the}} border, was similarly defined by the Fifth and the Seventh Ottoman–Venetian Wars.|$|E
5|$|Fausto's {{regeneration}} {{north of}} Hawaii was unusual but not unprecedented. The other time this happened since 1966 {{was in the}} 1975 season.

Other tropical cyclones have strengthened north of Hawaii, but the actual formation of one is rare.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{supernova}} explosion, the <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> the donor star (IK Pegasus A) would {{continue with the}} final velocity it possessed {{when it was a}} member of a close orbiting binary system. The resulting relative velocity could be as high as 100–200km/s, which would place it among the high-velocity members of the galaxy. The companion will also have lost some mass during the explosion, and its presence may create a gap in the expanding debris. From that point forward it will evolve into a single white dwarf star. The supernova explosion will create a <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> expanding material that will eventually merge with the surrounding interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|Galileo, like Tycho before him, {{tried in}} vain to measure the {{parallax}} of this new star, and then argued against the Aristotelian view of an immutable heavens. The <b>remnant</b> <b>of</b> this supernova was identified in 1941 at the Mount Wilson Observatory.|$|E
