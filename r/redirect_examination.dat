2500|$|On June 30, {{the defense}} called Krystal Holloway, a {{volunteer}} {{in the search}} for Caylee, who stated that she had had an affair with George Anthony, that he had been to her home, and that he had texted her, [...] "Just thinking about you. Ineed you in my life." [...] She told the defense that George Anthony had told her that Caylee's death was [...] "an accident that snowballed out of control." [...] Under cross-examination by prosecutors, they pointed to her sworn police statement in which she had said that George Anthony believed it was an accident, rather than knowing that it was. In her initial report, Holloway reported George Anthony saying, [...] "I really believe that it was an accident that just went wrong and (Casey Anthony) tried to cover it up." [...] She said he had not told her he was present when the alleged accident occurred. During <b>redirect</b> <b>examination,</b> Baez asked Holloway if George Anthony had told her that Caylee was dead while stating publicly that she was missing, to which she replied yes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Redirect</b> <b>examination</b> is {{the trial}} {{process by which}} the party who offered the witness has a chance to explain or {{otherwise}} qualify any damaging or accusing testimony brought out by the opponent during cross-examination. <b>Redirect</b> <b>examination</b> may question only those areas brought out on cross-examination and may not stray beyond that boundary.|$|E
5000|$|Casey made {{headlines}} throughout the trial by his aggressive questioning. He repeatedly asked witnesses - mostly doctors who perform abortions - {{about the possibility}} that fetuses feel pain during abortion, and whether patients are truly informed of that possibility. For example, the following is from an exchange during the <b>redirect</b> <b>examination</b> of Dr. Timothy Johnson: ...|$|E
5000|$|Each {{team has}} 30 minutes [...] for witness testimony, {{including}} all direct, cross, <b>redirect,</b> and recross <b>examinations</b> conducted by counsel of that team. (The clock does stop, however, {{for a variety}} of reasons, including, but not limited to, objections and parts of the process for entering exhibits.) ...|$|R
50|$|The mock trial {{begins with}} the judge {{entering}} the courtroom. The judge then gives out the instructions to the jury (about what they are to listen to). Then {{if there is a}} pretrial motion, the defense and prosecution give their respective pretrial arguments. The judge then lets the prosecution or plaintiff give an opening statement. Following the prosecution/plaintiff's opening statement, the judge may offer the defense to deliver the opening statement during that time as well, or to wait until after the prosecution has presented all of its witnesses. After the opening statements, examination of the witnesses begins. The prosecution/plaintiff calls their witnesses first. Witnesses are sworn in by their team's bailiff/timekeeper. A student competitor attorney for the prosecution/plaintiff does a direct examination of the witness. Once the direct examination is complete, the opposing team may cross-examine the witness. After the cross-examination, if the first team chooses, they may redirect the witness and, likewise, the other team may do a re-cross after this. However, <b>redirect</b> and re-cross <b>examinations</b> are only limited to the scope of the previous examination conducted by opposing counsel. This process is repeated for the two remaining plaintiff witnesses. Once the prosecution/plaintiff have finished with their witnesses, the defense may give their opening statement if not delivered before, and then the process is repeated with the defense witnesses, having the defense attorneys direct and the plaintiff attorneys cross-examine.|$|R
50|$|In a court proceeding, {{a witness}} {{may be called}} (requested to testify) by either the {{prosecution}} or the defense. The side that calls the witness first asks questions, in what is called direct examination. The opposing side then may ask their own questions in what is called cross-examination. In some cases, <b>redirect</b> <b>examination</b> may {{be used by the}} side that called the witness, but usually only to contradict specific testimony from the cross-examination.|$|E
50|$|The witness phase {{took three}} weeks, {{during which the}} United Kingdom called seven witnesses, while Albania called three. Witness and expert {{examinations}} generally followed the common law system, with direct examination, cross-examination and <b>redirect</b> <b>examination.</b> This phase of the proceedings was also characterized by flexibility {{on the part of}} the Court, with a view to the novelty of the entire situation. On one occasion, the Court allowed recross examination. The Court itself asked questions of some witnesses, almost always between the conclusion of cross-examination and the beginning of <b>redirect</b> <b>examination.</b> On one occasion, the ad hoc judge asked a question of an expert witness between direct and cross-examination; the Court and the parties agreed that the question would instead be submitted in written form to the joint panel of experts. Examinations were primarily conducted in English and French, with interpreters where necessary. During the Albanian cross-examination of Kovacic, the Court had to rule on an objection regarding whether a photostatic copy of a document was admissible as evidence. The Court ruled that the original document needed to be produced, though it confined its ruling to the individual document. A subsequent evidentiary dispute was similarly resolved solely with respect to the disputed documents, without having an effect on precedence. The examination phase was comparatively long, requiring twenty sittings of the Court, compared to fifteen sittings for the two rounds of pleadings.|$|E
50|$|After opening statements, the plaintiff/prosecution {{calls its}} first witness. The plaintiff/prosecution conducts a direct {{examination}} of the witness, and then defense conducts a cross {{examination of the}} same witness. After cross-examination, plaintiff/prosecution {{has the opportunity to}} conduct a <b>redirect</b> <b>examination</b> of the witness. If they do, defense is given the chance to recross the witness. After either all four types of exams have been conducted or one party abstains from doing redirect or recross respectively, the witness steps down from the stand. This process is then repeated for two more plaintiff/prosecution witnesses. With the conclusion of testimony from the third plaintiff witness, the plaintiff rests. The Defense then calls three witnesses in the same manner described above for the plaintiff/prosecution.|$|E
5000|$|Jurisdiction [...] is {{implemented}} through due process regulated by law. Adversary proceedings, equality {{before the law}} and the impartiality of the judge are recognised for all court trials, whose duration of trials is reasonably established by law. The right to a fair trial is recognized, with the defendant having the right to be promptly informed confidentially of the nature and reasons for the charges brought and the right to adequate time and conditions to prepare a defence. The rights to direct, cross and <b>redirect</b> <b>examination</b> are also recognised to both the defendant and the prosecutor. The defendant has also the right to produce all other evidence in favour of the defence, and to be assisted by an interpreter in the case that he or she does not speak or understand the language in which the court proceedings are conducted.|$|E
5000|$|Swingle {{researched}} {{the scientific literature}} on the subject {{as part of his}} extensive preparation for the cross. He found that the concept was both highly controversial within the psychiatric and psychological communities, and older than Dinwiddie claimed. At trial he got Dinwiddie to admit that she had only reviewed the victim's letters, had not been allowed to speak at length with any of her family members, and could not officially make a diagnosis as she was, unlike a psychiatrist, not a physician. Finally he asked if she agreed with a statement by Harvard Medical School psychiatry professor Harrison Pope that [...] "it would be pure speculation for a psychiatrist to try to give a formal diagnosis of a dead person he has never met." [...] She did agree, undermining her previous testimony. Seeing how effective that answer was, he ended the examination at that point. After a short <b>redirect</b> <b>examination,</b> she left the courtroom in tears. A cameraman for a local TV station called him [...] "Perry Mason" [...] afterwards. The defendant was convicted of second-degree murder, and sentenced to life.|$|E

50|$|The {{defense is}} given wide {{latitude}} in cross-examining witnesses. As of 2013 {{in cases where}} sexual assault is alleged some critics allege an extremely intrusive and aggressive cross examination of the victim is permitted, a practice which has been cited by critics of the military's handling of sexual assault in the United States military. In one case, a midshipman at the Navy Academy was interrogated for 30 hours over several days about their past sexual behavior. If the commander details an attorney to represent the United States, this government representative will normally conduct a direct examination of the government witnesses. This is followed by cross-examination by the defense and examination by the investigating officer upon completion of questioning by both counsel. Likewise, if a defense witness is called, the defense counsel will normally conduct a direct examination followed by a government cross-examination. After <b>redirect</b> <b>examination</b> by the defense counsel, or completion of questioning by both counsel, the investigating officer may conduct additional examination. The exact procedures to be followed in the hearing are not specified in either the Uniform Code of Military Justice or the Manual for Court-Martial.|$|E

40|$|Superior {{insights}} into molecular mechanisms of liver failure, {{which are not}} fully understood, will help strategies for inducing liver regeneration. We examined hepatotoxic mechanisms in mice homozygous for the severe combined immune deficiency mutation in the protein kinase, DNA-activated, catalytic polypeptide. Mice were treated with rifampicin, phenytoin, and monocrotaline. The ensuing acute liver failure was characterized by serological, histological, and mRNA studies. Subsequently, we studied whether transplantation of hepatocytes could rescue animals with liver failure. We found extensive liver damage in these animals, with mortality over several days. The expression of multiple hepatic genes was rapidly altered, including those representing pathways in oxidative/metabolic stress, inflammation, DNA damage-repair, and ataxia telangiectasia mutant (Atm) signaling pathways. This led to liver cell growth arrest involving cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 A. Transplantation of hepatocytes with microcarriers in the peritoneal cavity efficiently rescued animals with liver failure. Molecular abnormalities rapidly reversed, including in hepatic Atm and downstream signaling pathways; and residual hepatocytes overcame cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 A–induced cell growth arrest. Reseeding of the liver with transplanted hepatocytes was not required for rescue because native hepatocytes overcame cell growth-arrest to regenerate the liver. This likely resulted from paracrine signaling from hepatocytes in the peritoneal cavity. We concluded that Atm signaling played critical roles in the pathological features of liver failure. These studies should help <b>redirect</b> <b>examination</b> of pathophysiologic and therapeutic mechanisms in liver failure...|$|E
