5000|$|A {{closely related}} plant in North America, {{sometimes}} {{regarded as the}} variety <b>Rubus</b> <b>idaeus</b> var. strigosus, is more commonly treated as a distinct species, Rubus strigosus (American Red Raspberry), as is done here.

5000|$|Botanists {{have long}} debated the taxonomic {{treatment}} of the Eurasian and American red raspberries, with some viewing all of these plants {{as members of a}} single, circumboreal species <b>Rubus</b> <b>idaeus,</b> and others recognizing two (or more) species within this group. [...] The two species share many similarities, and probably recently diverged from a common ancestor, leading to differences in taxonomic interpretation, particularly regarding the more intermediate eastern Asian plants. A common current treatment, followed here, is to classify the North American red raspberries as Rubus strigosus, and include only the Eurasian plants in <b>Rubus</b> <b>idaeus.</b> When the species are combined, as done in some recent publications, the Eurasian plants are <b>Rubus</b> <b>idaeus</b> ssp. idaeus (or <b>Rubus</b> <b>idaeus</b> var. idaeus), and the American plants R. idaeus ssp. strigosus (or R. idaeus var. strigosus). Different interpretations are also sometimes made regarding placement of various eastern Asian populations of this group, by some considered to represent additional varieties or subspecies, if not different species altogether. The most distinctive physical difference among these plants is usual presence of gland-tipped hairs on first-year canes, petioles, pedicels, and calyces of R. strigosus, lacking in R. idaeus.|$|E
