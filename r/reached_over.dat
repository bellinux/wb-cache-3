Five thousand copies of the first edition were printed, and by 1907 the press run <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> 40,000.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} these changes had little practical effect, possibly due to opposition by the planners and confusion or fear among cadres. From 1981–84 agricultural production grew substantially, {{but the government}} did not use this opportunity to increase production of such crucial farm inputs as fertilizer, pesticide and fuel, nor of consumer goods. By the end of Lê Duẩn's rule, in 1985–1986, inflation had <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> 100% annually, complicating economic policy-making.|$|E

5|$|Moisture {{from the}} {{remnants}} of Isis spread across the southwestern United States, and rainfall <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> 0.75inches (19mm) in Nevada and Utah. Low-level moisture dissipated as it continued inland, due to dry air, although upper-level moisture produced light rain across the Northwestern United States; Pocatello, Idaho recorded 0.59inches (15mm), while Missoula, Montana recorded 0.39inches (10mm).|$|E
5|$|Rainfall from Florence <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> 7inches (178mm) at one {{location}} in southeastern Mississippi, while a station 3miles (4.8km) south-southeast of Brewton, Alabama reported a storm-wide peak rainfall total of 10.67inches (271mm).

The upper level jet stream also contributed a large amount of wind shear. These factors were all indicative of a high potential for severe weather.|$|E

5|$|By 15th century, the Malacca Sultanate, whose hegemony <b>reached</b> <b>over</b> much of {{the western}} Malay archipelago, had become the centre of Islamization in the east.

The close identification of the Malays with Islam continued until the 20th century and was finally entrenched in the Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia as well as in the national philosophy of Brunei known as the Malay Islamic Monarchy.|$|E
