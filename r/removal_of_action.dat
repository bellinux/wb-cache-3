40|$|AbstractModulation of Ca 2 + {{channels}} by neurotransmitters provides {{critical control}} of neuronal excitability and synaptic strength. Little {{is known about}} regulation of the Ca 2 + efflux pathways that counterbalance Ca 2 + influx in neurons. We demonstrate that bradykinin and ATP significantly facilitate <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> potential-induced Ca 2 + loads by stimulating plasma membrane Ca 2 +-ATPases (PMCAs) in rat sensory neurons. This effect was mimicked in the soma and axonal varicosities by phorbol esters and was blocked by antagonists of protein kinase C (PKC). Reduced expression of PMCA isoform 4 abolished, and overexpression of isoform 4 b enhanced, PKC-dependent facilitation of Ca 2 + efflux. This acceleration of PMCA 4 underlies the shortening of the action potential afterhyperpolarization produced by activation of bradykinin and purinergic receptors. Thus, isoform-specific modulation of PMCA-mediated Ca 2 + efflux represents a novel mechanism to control excitability in sensory neurons...|$|E
40|$|In 2007, the {{collapse}} of the housing market and the developing trend of state court filings <b>of</b> class <b>actions</b> alleging violations <b>of</b> the Securities Act culminated into a new type of securities litigation: state court filings <b>of</b> class <b>actions</b> alleging violations <b>of</b> the Securities Act with respect to non-publicly traded securities in general and mortgage-backed securities in particular. Thus, it became important for defendants to remove these claims to federal court. Permitting <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> such claims appears to conflict with the Securities Act, which broadly prohibits <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> claims arising under the Securities Act. But prohibiting removal is in tension with the Class <b>Action</b> Fairness Act <b>of</b> 2005, which generally permits <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> class <b>actions.</b> This article considers whether the Securities Act bars <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> class <b>actions</b> alleging violations <b>of</b> the Securities Act with respect to non-publicly traded securities. Part I of this article provides a background on the issue and explains the general framework <b>of</b> <b>removal</b> and the conflicting provisions of the Securities Act and the Class Action Fairness Act.

On the other hand, a potential problem with using the College Board is that a student’s decision about whether to take the SAT could be affected by Prop 209, leading to possible sample selection bias. Dickson (2006) finds that <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> affirmative <b>action</b> in Texas led {{to a decline in}} the percentage of minority high school graduates who take either the ACT or SAT of roughly 3 – 4 percent.

40|$|Abstract. We study {{some aspects}} of the {{complexity}} of some verification and planning prob-lems. We first show that the complexity of Temporal Logic Model Checking, Containment, and Simulation, under structural restrictions on the model, does not decrease. On the contrary the complexity of the image computation in the explicit case decreases, if the sequential transi-tion system has bounded treewidth. The complexity of these problems in the general case is well-known [SC 85,KVW 00,HKV 02]. Then, we introduce a preprocessing step, that can use any amount of time and space; the result of this step is stored in a polynomial data structure. We show that, despite this kind of preprocessing, the complexity of the Temporal Logic Model Check-ing problem does not decrease. Then, we prove that a large class of data structure, including all kind of BDDs, ADDs, and MTBDDs, does not allow to Symbolic Model Checking algorithms to run in polynomial space. About planning, we show the computational complexity of some problems related to the re-dundancy <b>of</b> actions; an <b>action</b> is redundant in a planning domain if it is not needed to reach the goal. The problems that we consider are: checking whether a domain contains a redundant action, what is the minimal number <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> needed to make the goal reachable, checking whether the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> an <b>action</b> does not increase the minimal plan length, and other related problems.

Following acute renal denervation clearance experiments were performed. In {{a different set of}} experiments, the renal nerves were electrically stimulated at increasing frequencies and responses in renal blood flow and renal vascular resistance were recorded. Results: Denervated post-ischaemic acute renal failure (ARF) rats showed higher urine flow rate, absolute and fractional sodium excretions, urinary sodium to urinary potassium, glomerular filtration rate and basal renal blood flow but lower basal renal vascular resistance (all p 0. 05 vs innervated ARF rats). The rise in mean arterial pressure and renal vasoconstrictor response to renal nerve stimulation were blunted in denervated ischaemic ARF rats (all p < 0. 05 vs innervated ARF rats). Renal histopathology in denervated ARF rats manifested a significantly lower medullary congestion, inflammation and tubular injury compared to innervated counterparts (p < 0. 05 vs innervated ARF rats).

40|$|This Article {{addresses}} the removal and preemption {{provisions of the}} Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (“SLUSA”). In SLUSA, Congress preempted class actions alleging “an untrue statement or omission of a material fact {{in connection with the}} purchase or sale of a covered security. ” SLUSA clearly applies to preempt the typical state securities fraud action, forcing plaintiffs into federal court where they will be subject to the rigorous procedural requirements of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Preemption of false corporate publicity cases was expected and, in fact, intended by SLUSA. However, many courts have also extended SLUSA to preempt very different types of claims, including breach of fiduciary duty claims, breach of contract claims, and claims based on state deceptive and unfair trade practices acts. Not surprisingly, plaintiffs have argued that Congress never intended to preempt these types of claims, while defendants have argued just as forcefully that plaintiffs should not be able to circumvent the strong federal policies set forth in SLUSA through artful pleading. There is an obvious policy clash: a concern for federalism versus the prevention <b>of</b> frivolous <b>actions</b> and strike suits. In this Article, I try to clarify how courts should interpret SLUSA’s preemption provision. I also discuss the interrelationship between preemption and the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> to federal court, paying particular attention to the well-pleaded complaint rule and complete preemption doctrine. I conclude that SLUSA is not limited to state securities fraud claims. Instead, the statute requires courts to examine the allegations actually made in the complaint to determine if SLUSA is triggered. If the complaint alleges a materially misleading statement in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security, the class action should be preempted, regardless of the theory of liability chosen by the plaintiff. Because I argue that SLUSA is triggered by the allegations actually made in the complaint, I reject those cases that have looked beyond the complaint to determine if the case is preempted. In addition, I demonstrate that plaintiffs should be permitted to avoid preemption through careful pleading; thus, for example, a plaintiff should be able to avoid preemption if he alleges that the defendant’s fraud induced him to hold, rather than purchase or sell, his securities. Finally, I argue that SLUSA’s “in connection with” requirement should be narrowly construed. My recommendations are based on statutory interpretation, legislative history, and the goals of the federal securities laws, including SLUSA. They are also founded on an understanding of the important policies that have been implicated by SLUSA. In particular, I argue that the courts have failed to sufficiently consider federalism concerns in interpreting SLUSA, potentially leading to a dangerous expansion of SLUSA’s preemptive scope...|$|R
