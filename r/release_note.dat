The <b>release</b> <b>note</b> of HSI Version 2 also notes efforts to balance local and global context, individual and society concerns, left-right political issues, east-west and north-south cultural and social issues.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} ARENA (Automatic <b>RElease</b> <b>Notes</b> generAtor), {{an approach}} for the automatic generation of <b>release</b> <b>notes.</b> ARENA extracts changes {{from the source}} code, summarizes them, and integrates them with informa-tion from versioning systems and issue trackers. It was de-signed based on the manual analysis of 1, 000 existing <b>release</b> <b>notes.</b> To evaluate {{the quality of the}} ARENA <b>release</b> <b>notes,</b> we performed three empirical studies involving a total of 53 participants (45 professional developers and 8 students). The results indicate that the ARENA <b>release</b> <b>notes</b> are very good approximations of those produced by the developers and often include important information that is missing in the manually produced <b>release</b> <b>notes...</b>|$|R

50|$|On 30 August 2015, Zeqiri {{completed}} a transfer {{to his first}} club Flamurtari Vlorë, returning for the second time. On 1 February 2017, Zeqiri played 84 minutes in the returning leg of Albanian Cup quarter-final against Besëlidhja Lezhë, which ended in a 1-2 home shock loss, which brought the elimination from the competiton. After the match, while at dressing room, he had a clash with club administrator Sinan Idrizi, which resulted him being suspended. It was raported by the media that Zeqiri accused Idrizi of treating players in double standarts. As the debate went on, Izridi told Zeqiri to leave the room, as {{he was no longer}} in his plans, but he (Zeqiri) refused, telling to send him a the <b>release</b> <b>note.</b> On 3 February, he was also told {{that he was going to}} train with the youth time until a second decision. On 11 February, he was officially released by the club, thus becoming a free agent.|$|E

5000|$|Although songwriting credits on the {{official}} <b>release</b> <b>note</b> all three songs featured on the single as being written collectively by Hole, according to BMI, [...] "Beautiful Son" [...] and [...] "20 Years in the Dakota" [...] were written by Courtney Love, Eric Erlandson and Patty Schemel. However, the single's b-side [...] "Old Age" [...] {{was the subject of}} controversy in the 1998 when it was revealed to be a Cobain composition by the Seattle newspaper The Stranger. However, prior to the publication, Love stated in an interview that [...] "Old Age" [...] "is partly someone else's composition. It's something somebody {{had a little bit of}} and I said 'let me have the rest of it' and I wrote this thing in it and tried to make it goth. I found it, wrote it, and recorded it the same night." [...] In actuality, [...] "Old Age" [...] was initially a Cobain-penned song, and recorded during the sessions for Nevermind (1991), but after dissatisfaction with the song, gave it to Love. Love re-arranged parts of the song melodically and used entirely different lyrics.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the death}} of de Toroge, assassinated by Heraclius, Patriarch of Jerusalem, Gerard of Ridefort is named new Grand Master, and Arn is {{immediately}} dismissed {{from the city and}} retakes his position in Gaza. Arn now becomes disillusioned by the crusades and in the Battle of Hattin, Arn is severely wounded and spends several weeks at Saladin's hospital in Damascus. He then becomes a personal advisor to Saladin and convinces Saladin to spare the population of Jerusalem, which is conquered (in 1187). Also in Saladin's captivity is Gerard of Ridefort, who, by [...] "persuasion", signs Arn's <b>release</b> <b>note</b> from the order. In {{the very end of the}} book, Richard the Lionheart comes to Palestine with an army of crusaders. Richard captures Acre from Saladin, and when Saladin tries to buy back 5,700 prisoners from him, Richard prefers to massacre the populace instead, because some terms had not been fulfilled. Arn is now very eager to return home, and Saladin donates to Arn the remaining sum of money which the Lionheart forsook in his lust for blood. As is told in the following book, Arn travels to Acre, on the way hiring various craftsmen, then obtains a Templar cargo ship and departs for his homeland.|$|E
5000|$|... (1) The {{need for}} some administrators using {{multicast}} access to reliably communicate with [...] "client" [...] computers on local subnet(s) by giving them fixed DHCP addresses (via the router) is not discussed in any User's Guide (although this used not to be necessary in earlier versions, and may be an unfixed bug). The view-only stand-alone [...] "Retrospect Dashboard" [...] application for Retrospect Windows is still {{not mentioned in the}} User's Guide as of March 2017. On the other hand, because the Retrospect Windows User's Guide is now substantially different from the Retrospect Macintosh User's Guide, there seem to be some problems keeping the updates in sync. For example, the Server Editions' capability of running two or more Scripts scheduled for the same time on the same [...] "backup server" [...] simultaneously is not discussed in the Retrospect Macintosh User's Guide—either the method of specifying different [...] "activity threads" [...] for the Scripts or the source-destination conflict analysis of all Scripts that are scheduled to run at the same time. For another example, the sequence in which Sources are processed by Scripts—both the default and the method of changing it, mentioned in the [...] "Retrospect Macintosh 8" [...] section above, is not discussed in the Retrospect Macintosh User's Guide. For a third example, the only mention of WebDAV shares in the Retrospect Windows User's Guides for v9 and above is a <b>Release</b> <b>Note</b> for Retrospect Windows 8 that refers to an incorrect page number—but gives an apparently-important requirement for the UNC path. [...] However the equivalent WebDAV mention in the [...] "What's New" [...] chapter in the Retrospect Macintosh 9 User's Guide Addendum did make its way to a paragraph in another chapter of later versions of the Macintosh User's Guide.|$|E
