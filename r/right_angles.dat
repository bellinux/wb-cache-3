Assume that initially, {{the body in the}} static orbit starts out at <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> to the radius with speed V. The body in the revolving orbit must also start at <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> and assume its speed is v. In the case shown in Fig. 1., v > V and the force is directed towards S. The argument applies equally if v < V. Also, the force may be directed away from the centre.|$|E

5|$|Epitheliomuscular cells whose bodies {{form part}} of the {{epithelium}} but whose bases extend to form muscle fibers in parallel rows. The fibers of the outward-facing cell layer generally run at <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> to the fibers of the inward-facing one. In Anthozoa (anemones, corals, etc.) and Scyphozoa (jellyfish), the mesoglea also contains some muscle cells.|$|E
5|$|Since then, many {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} measuring such dragging coefficients, often {{in combination with the}} Sagnac effect. For instance, in experiments using ring lasers together with rotating disks, or in neutron interferometric experiments. Also a transverse dragging effect was observed, i.e. when the medium is moving at <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> to the direction of the incident light.|$|E
2500|$|Complementary angles are angle pairs whose {{measures}} sum to one <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> ( [...] turn, 90°, or [...] radians). If the two {{complementary angles}} are adjacent their non-shared sides form a <b>right</b> <b>angle.</b> In Euclidean geometry, the two acute <b>angles</b> in a <b>right</b> triangle are complementary, because {{the sum of}} internal angles of a triangle is 180 degrees, and the <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> itself accounts for ninety degrees.|$|R

After letters were published in The Field deriding the state of affairs it was decided to unite the kicking game under one set of laws. By this time the FA Cup had helped the FA gain a dominant position within the game. The FA accepted the Sheffield rule allowing throw-ins to be thrown in any direction, as opposed to <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> only as prevails in rugby lineouts. In return the FA's use of a three-man offside was adopted.|$|E
5|$|Even {{following}} the conversion to cylindrical smokeboxes, {{it was still}} possible to distinguish some non-streamliners from ex-streamliners. On the former (Nos. 46230-46234 and 46249-46252, but not 46253-46257) the running plates veered downwards at <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> {{to connect with the}} buffer beam {{in the style of the}} Princess Royal Class.

5|$|If {{a person}} spots a nearby tornado while driving, the {{official}} National Weather Service directive {{has been for}} the individual to abandon the car and seek shelter in a ditch or culvert, or substantial shelter if nearby. Far-away, highly visible tornadoes, however, can be successfully fled from at <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> (90-degrees) from its direction of apparent movement. Despite dangers inherent with operating a vehicle during a tornado, given sufficient advance warning, mobile home residents have been instructed by the National Weather Service to drive to the nearest secure shelter during a warning.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fundamental}} triangle has a <b>right</b> <b>angle.</b> The {{proof of this}} involves two cases dependent on if the angles of the decomposed triangle are fundamental. If they are not, then it follows that since the process of decomposition is finite, eventually a {{fundamental triangle}} will be formed with a <b>right</b> <b>angle.</b> If they are, a proof by contradiction based on {{the area of the}} fundamental triangle proves that it will have a <b>right</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|R

5|$|Oscarsson in {{the late}} 1970s {{proposed}} that these cortical zones can be partitioned into smaller units called microzones. A microzone {{is defined as a}} group of Purkinje cells all having the same somatotopic receptive field. Microzones were found to contain on the order of 1000 Purkinje cells each, arranged in a long, narrow strip, oriented perpendicular to the cortical folds. Thus, as the adjoining diagram illustrates, Purkinje cell dendrites are flattened {{in the same direction as}} the microzones extend, while parallel fibers cross them at <b>right</b> <b>angles.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Austrians briefly {{took the}} {{advantage}} {{when they moved}} a battery from the ridge north of the village to cover their infantry; the fire from the battery allowed the infantry to deploy at <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> to their original front. Frederick responded by ordering {{the last of his}} reserved left wing to advance, but the Austrian battery drove it back. Finally, Frederick's heavy cannons on the Butterberg, a small knoll to the west of town, laid down a barrage. Some participants said it was this barrage, more than the Prussian infantry, which won the battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{inner ear}} sits within the {{temporal}} bone in a complex cavity called the bony labyrinth. A central area known as the vestibule contains two small fluid-filled recesses, the utricle and saccule. These connect to the semicircular canals and the cochlea. There are three semicircular canals angled at <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> to each other which are responsible for dynamic balance. The cochlea is a spiral shell-shaped organ responsible for the sense of hearing. These structures together create the membranous labyrinth.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes a right kite {{is defined}} as a kite with at least one <b>right</b> <b>angle.</b> If there is only one <b>right</b> <b>angle,</b> it must be between two sides of equal length; in this case, the {{formulas}} given above do not apply.|$|R

50|$|In diagrams, {{the fact}} that an <b>angle</b> is a <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> is usually {{expressed}} by adding a small <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> that forms a square with the angle in the diagram, as seen in the diagram of a right triangle (in British English, a right-angled triangle) to the right. The symbol for a measured angle, an arc, with a dot, is used in some European countries, including German-speaking countries and Poland, as an alternative symbol for a <b>right</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|R
5|$|When {{movement}} is required, one {{strategy is to}} minimise the motion signal, for example by avoiding waving limbs about and by choosing patterns that do not cause flicker when seen by the prey from straight ahead. Cuttlefish may be doing this with their active camouflage by choosing to form stripes at <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> to their front-back axis, minimising motion signals that would be given by occluding and displaying the pattern as they swim.|$|E
5|$|Dynamic {{balance is}} {{provided}} through the three semicircular canals. These three canals are orthogonal (at <b>right</b> <b>angles)</b> to each other. At {{the end of}} each canal is a slight enlargement, known as the ampulla, which contains numerous cells with filaments in a central area called the cupula. The fluid in these canals rotates according to the momentum of the head. When a person changes acceleration, the inertia of the fluid changes. This affects the pressure on the cupula, and results in the opening of ion channels. This causes depolarisation, which is passed as a signal to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve. Dynamic balance also helps maintain eye tracking when moving, via the vestibulo–ocular reflex.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{potential}} is a scalar quantity, that is, {{it has only}} magnitude and not direction. It {{may be viewed as}} analogous to height: just as a released object will fall through a difference in heights caused by a gravitational field, so a charge will 'fall' across the voltage caused by an electric field. As relief maps show contour lines marking points of equal height, a set of lines marking points of equal potential (known as equipotentials) may be drawn around an electrostatically charged object. The equipotentials cross all lines of force at <b>right</b> <b>angles.</b> They must also lie parallel to a conductor's surface, otherwise this would produce a force that will move the charge carriers to even the potential of the surface.|$|E
50|$|Proof: Since angle BDA is a <b>right</b> <b>angle,</b> angle DBA equals π/2 minus angle DAB. However, angle DAH also equals π/2 minus angle DAB (since angle HAB is a <b>right</b> <b>angle).</b> Therefore triangles DBA and DAH are similar. Therefore angle DIA equals angle DOH, where I is the {{midpoint}} of BA and O is {{the midpoint}} of AH. But AOH is a straight line, so angle DOH and DOA are supplementary angles. Therefore the sum of angles DIA and DOA is π. Angle IAO is a <b>right</b> <b>angle.</b> The sum of the angles in any quadrilateral is 2π, so in quadrilateral IDOA, angle IDO must be a <b>right</b> <b>angle.</b> But ADHE is a rectangle, so the midpoint O of AH (the rectangle's diagonal) is also {{the midpoint of}} DE (the rectangle's other diagonal). As I (defined as the midpoint of BA) {{is the center of}} semicircle BA, and angle IDE is a <b>right</b> <b>angle,</b> then DE is tangent to semicircle BA at D. By analogous reasoning DE is tangent to semicircle AC at E. Q.E.D.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the fact}} that all perovskites have cubic {{structure}} at ambient pressure and sufficient high temperature, strontium titanate offers a worthy basis for investigations of mechanical properties of the oxide perovskites owing to its cubic structure over a large temperature range. the single crystals of strontium titanate were grown by the Verneuil technique. The compression specimens of STO used in this study are of quadrangular shape, 2. 5 x 2. 5 x 6 mm" 3 in dimension. The long axis of the crystal is parallel to the following crystallographic axes: left <b>angle</b> 001 <b>right</b> <b>angle,</b> left <b>angle</b> 011 <b>right</b> <b>angle,</b> left <b>angle</b> 112 <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> and left <b>angle</b> 345 <b>right</b> <b>angle.</b> All surfaces of the specimens were polished to a quality appropriate for preliminary investigations by the polarized light. The compression tests were performed at temperatures between 78 K and 1810 K for the specimens with left <b>angle</b> 001 <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> axis, while for those of the other afore mentioned axes, between room temperature and 1810 K. Three regimes of different plastic behaviour can be distinguished depending on temperature.

5|$|Except for {{the corner}} houses, {{the houses were}} built in pairs, each sharing a porch with its neighbour. For many of the smaller fourth- and fifth-class houses, the doors were aligned at <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> to the façade of the house, {{so as not to}} open {{directly}} adjacently to their neighbours. All houses were designed with at least one parlour and with the kitchen, scullery, and toilet in separate rooms {{at the rear of the}} house; the first-class houses also had toilets upstairs. In line with the design principles of the time, the downstairs toilets were accessible only from the back gardens, and the houses were not fitted with separate bathrooms; baths were taken in a moveable bath located in the kitchen.|$|E
5|$|Like the House of the Lake, most {{houses in}} the crowded Theatre Quarter of Delos have irregular-shaped floor plans (such as {{trapezoidal}} designs), as opposed to square or rectangular designs. The narrow and irregular street grid is unlike that of other quarters, where streets usually meet at approximately <b>right</b> <b>angles.</b> Similar {{to the majority of}} excavated homes of Delos, those in the Theatre Quarter feature an open courtyard without porticoes, instead of the peristyle layout with columns. Some of the {{houses in the}} Theatre Quarter lack interior decoration altogether, with neither wall murals nor mosaics, which is unusual for most Delian homes.|$|E
5|$|Popping as an {{umbrella}} term also includes gliding. Gliding is a lower body dance performed {{with little to}} no movements in the chest or arms. In gliding a dancer appears {{as if they are}} drifting across the floor on ice. Opposite from gliding is tutting, an upper body dance that uses the arms, hands, and wrists to form <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> and create geometric box-like shapes. Tutting can be done primarily with the fingers rather than the arms. This method is called finger tutting. In both variations the movements are intricate, linear, and form 90° or 45° angles. In practice, tutting looks like the characters on the art of ancient Egypt, hence the name—a reference to King Tut.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the rank gradient {{and growth of}} torsion in homology in residually finite groups. As a tool, we introduce a new complexity notion for generating sets, using measured groupoids and combinatorial cost.

A group is <b>right</b> <b>angled</b> {{if it can be}} generated by a sequence of elements of infinite order such that any two consecutive elements commute. Most non-uniform lattices in higher rank simple Lie groups are <b>right</b> <b>angled.</b> We provide the first examples of uniform (co-compact) <b>right</b> <b>angled</b> arithmetic groups in SL(n, R), n ≥ 3 and SO(p, q) for some values of p, q.
