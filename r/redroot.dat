5|$|Ailanthus {{produces}} an allelopathic chemical called ailanthone, which inhibits {{the growth of}} other plants. The inhibitors are strongest in the bark and roots, but are also present in the leaves, wood and seeds of the plant. One study showed that a crude extract of the root bark inhibited 50% of a sample of garden cress (Lepidium sativum) seeds from germinating. The same study tested the extract as an herbicide on garden cress, <b>redroot</b> pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti), yellow bristlegrass (Setaria pumila), barnyard grass (Echinochloa crusgalli), pea (Pisum sativum cv. Sugar Snap) and maize (Zea mays cv. Silver Queen). It proved able to kill nearly 100% of seedlings {{with the exception of}} velvetleaf, which showed some resistance. Another experiment showed a water extract of the chemical was either lethal or highly damaging to 11 North American hardwoods and 34 conifers, with the white ash (Fraxinus americana) being the only plant not adversely affected. The chemical does not, however, affect the tree of heaven's own seedlings, indicating that A. altissima has a defence mechanism to prevent autotoxicity. Resistance in various plant species has been shown to increase with exposure. Populations without prior exposure to the chemicals are most susceptible to them. Seeds produced from exposed plants have also been shown to be more resistant than their unexposed counterparts.|$|E

50|$|This herb {{grows in}} a number of plant {{communities}} on the coastal plains of southern North Carolina and northern South Carolina, including pocosins, sandhills, pine flatwoods and pine savannas. It is most commonly found in open areas in the ecotone between longleaf pine uplands and pond pine pocosins. The soil is seasonally wet to waterlogged or submerged, low in nutrients, rich in peat over sandy substrates. The plant is found in sections of these habitat types which, in their pristine state, are openings in a dense layer of shrubs which are kept open by severe periodic wildfires. Fire prevents ecological succession, maintaining a type of ecosystem in which the taller vegetation is kept small and sparse, allowing the herb layer to flourish in the sun. Trees, shrubs, and ferns in the area include Aronia arbutifolia (chokeberry), Clethra alnifolia (summersweet), Cyrilla racemiflora (titi), Fothergilla gardenii (dwarf fothergilla), Ilex glabra (Appalachian tea), Magnolia virginiana (sweetbay), Osmunda cinnamomea (cinnamon fern), Persea palustris (swampbay), Symplocos tinctoria (yellowwood), and Vaccinium species (wild blueberries). Herbs, grasses, and mosses associated with this ecosystem include Andropogon glomeratus (bushy bluestem), Aristida stricta (wiregrass), Drosera intermedia (oblong-leaved sundew), Drosera capillaris (pink sundew), Lachnanthes caroliniana (<b>redroot),</b> Peltandra sagittifolia (spoon flower), Sarracenia flava (yellow pitcher plant), and Sphagnum species (sphagnum mosses).|$|E
50|$|Ailanthus {{has been}} used to re-vegetate areas where acid mine {{drainage}} has occurred and it has been shown to tolerate pH levels as low as 4.1 (approximately that of tomato juice). It can withstand very low phosphorus levels and high salinity levels. The drought-tolerance of the tree is strong due to its ability to effectively store water in its root system. It is frequently found in areas where few trees can survive. The roots are also aggressive enough to cause damage to subterranean sewers and pipes. Along highways it often forms dense thickets in which few other tree species are present, largely due to the toxins it produces to prevent competition.Ailanthus produces an allelopathic chemical called ailanthone, which inhibits the growth of other plants. The inhibitors are strongest in the bark and roots, but are also present in the leaves, wood and seeds of the plant. One study showed that a crude extract of the root bark inhibited 50% of a sample of garden cress (Lepidium sativum) seeds from germinating. The same study tested the extract as an herbicide on garden cress, <b>redroot</b> pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti), yellow bristlegrass (Setaria pumila), barnyard grass (Echinochloa crusgalli), pea (Pisum sativum cv.

Another experiment showed a water extract of the chemical was either lethal or highly damaging to 11 North American hardwoods and 34 conifers, with the white ash (Fraxinus americana) being the only plant not adversely affected. The chemical does not, however, affect the tree of heaven's own seedlings, indicating that A. altissima has a defence mechanism to prevent autotoxicity.

In the presented experiment, the allelopathic effects of <b>redroot</b> pigweed on germination and growth of four important crop species including cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), common bean (Phaseulus vulgaris L.) and bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was studied. The effect of different concentrations of <b>redroot</b> pigweed leachate on seed germination and seedlings growth parameters of tested plants was significant, but not same in all studied species.

In order to verify this result in situ field trials were performed. A strong repression of <b>redroot</b> pigweed growth by buckwheat could be observed independently of shading. However, soil both {{from the field and}} phytotron trials in which buckwheat had been growing didn’t have an effect on <b>redroot</b> pigweed and lettuce (Lactuca sativa) growth.

In none of the experiments an influence on lettuce and <b>redroot</b> pigweed development could be observed. We conclude that there are either no allelopathic molecules in the soil solution (not soluble in water) or that they are rapidly degraded. The observed growth inhibiting effect seems to be due to a long term and constant exposure of small quantities of allelopathic molecules.

Prominent volunteer species were annual foxtails (Setaria spp. Beauv.), <b>redroot</b> pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus SSL.), velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medic.), and common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.). Cattle consumed annual foxtails and <b>redroot</b> pigweed, but did not consume velvetleaf or common ragweed. Annual foxtails were grazed completely while heifers mainly stripped leaves and defoliated the tops of red root pigweed. <b>Redroot</b> pigweed and annual foxtails were randomly collected within blocks during both grazing seasons to quantify forage value. Foliage (upper stem and leaves) was analyzed for crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and in vitro dry matter disappearance (IVDMD). <b>Redroot</b> pigweed foliage and leaves were analyzed for nitrate (N 03). Crude protein levels of annual foxtails and <b>redroot</b> pigweed were never below nutritional requirements for heifers.
