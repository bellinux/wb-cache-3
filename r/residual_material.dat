40|$|Lignocellulosic biomasses {{derived from}} {{dedicated}} crops and agro-industrial <b>residual</b> <b>materials</b> are promising renewable {{resources for the}} production of fuels and other added value bioproducts. Due to the tolerance {{to a wide range of}} environments, the dedicated crops can be cultivated on marginal lands, avoiding conflict with food production and having beneficial effects on the environment. Besides, the agro-industrial <b>residual</b> <b>materials</b> represent an abundant, available, and cheap source of bioproducts that completely cut out the economical and environmental issues related to the cultivation of energy crops. Different processing steps like pretreatment, hydrolysis, and microbial fermentation are needed to convert biomass into added value bioproducts. The reactor configuration, the operative conditions, and the operation mode of the conversion processes are crucial parameters for a high yield and productivity of the biomass bioconversion process. This review summarizes the last progresses in the bioreactor field, with main attention on the new configurations and the agitation systems, for conversion of dedicated energy crops (Arundo donax) and <b>residual</b> <b>materials</b> (corn stover, wheat straw, mesquite wood, agave bagasse, fruit and citrus peel wastes, sunflower seed hull, switchgrass, poplar sawdust, cogon grass, sugarcane bagasse, sunflower seed hull, and poplar wood) into sugars and ethanol.

50|$|Nuoler Ried is a reed {{located on}} {{the north end of}} a large plane that was filled by the Wägitaler Aa and Spreitenbach streams. This delta is larger than those of Frauenwinkel or of the Jona river and Wurmsbach stream. The present marshes only {{comprise}} {{a small fraction of the}} formerly extensive, extensively used reed and meadows which offered numerous animals and plants a wide habitat. Larger areas of the present nature reserve, such as the so-called Schüttinsel, were created on the deposits of non-recyclable <b>residual</b> <b>material</b> from the nearby gravel extraction.|$|E
50|$|Materials such as {{glass and}} metals are removed during the {{treatment}} processing {{since they are}} non-combustible. The metal is removed using a magnet and the glass using mechanical screening. After that, an air knife is used to separate the light materials from the heavy ones. The light materials has higher calorific value and they create the final RDF. The heavy materials will usually continue to a landfill. The <b>residual</b> <b>material</b> can be sold in its processed form (depending on the process treatment) as a plain mixture {{or it may be}} compressed into pellet fuel, brickse or logs and used for other purposes either stand-alone or in a recursive recycling process.|$|E

50|$|The same {{capability}} of natural organic matter that helped with water retention in soil creates problems for current water purification methods. In water, organic matter can still bind to metal ions and minerals. These bound molecules {{are not necessarily}} stopped by the purification process, but do not cause harm to any humans, animals, or plants. However, {{because of the high}} level of reactivity of organic matter, by-products that do not contain nutrients can be made. These by-products can induce biofouling, which essentially clogs water filtration systems in water purification facilities, as the by-products are larger than membrane pore sizes. This clogging problem can be treated by chlorine disinfection (chlorination), which can break down <b>residual</b> <b>material</b> that clogs systems. However, chlorination can form disinfection by-products.|$|E
5000|$|ADS was {{developed}} as a non-lethal weapon. According to Department of Defense policy, non-lethal weapons [...] "are explicitly designed and primarily employed so as to incapacitate personnel or material, while minimizing fatalities, permanent injury to personnel, and undesired damage to property and the environment". ADS has applications for crowd control and perimeter defense, and filling [...] "the gap between shouting and shooting." [...] Other crowd control methods - including pepper spray, tear gas, water cannons, slippery foam and rubber bullets - carry implicit dangers of temporary or permanent injury or accidental death, and often leave residue or <b>residual</b> <b>material.</b> Combinations of acoustic and optical system platforms with ADS {{can be used to}} effectively communicate to, warn of escalation of force, introduce optical and auditory deterrents and step function the escalation of transmitted force from relatively benign to ultimately forced dispersal of a crowd, or to deny them from an area or access to an area. A group of people can theoretically be dispersed or induced to leave an area in a manner unlikely to damage personnel, non-involved civilians (no stray bullets), or to nearby buildings or the environment.|$|E

In the other cases external energy had {{to be added to}} supply the process with heat. Heat had to be supplied to the 1 G plant as it was assumed that the DDGS produced would be sold, and thus no <b>residual</b> <b>material</b> would be available for incineration. The <b>residual</b> <b>material</b> obtained from the 2 G process was not enough to supply both the 1 G and 2 G plants with energy. However, a reduction of about 30 % in the external energy required for heating in the 1 G plant could be accomplished, while completely satisfying the heat demand in the 2 G plant.|$|E
40|$|<b>Residual</b> {{radioactive}} <b>material</b> {{guidelines for}} uranium in soil were derived for the New Brunswick Site, located in Middlesex County, New Jersey. This site {{has been designated}} for remedial action under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program of the US Department of Energy (DOE). <b>Residual</b> radioactive <b>material</b> guidelines for individual radionuclides of concern and total uranium were derived {{on the basis of}} the requirement that the 50 -year committed effective dose equivalent to a hypothetical individual who lives or works in the immediate vicinity of the New Brunswick Site should not exceed a dose of 30 mrem/yr following remedial action for the current-use and likely future-use scenarios or a dose of 100 mrem/yr for less likely future-use scenarios. The DOE <b>residual</b> radioactive <b>material</b> guideline computer code, RESRAD, was used in this evaluation; RESRAD implements the methodology described in the DOE manual for establishing <b>residual</b> radioactive <b>material</b> guidelines. The guidelines derived in this report are intended to apply to the remediation of these remaining <b>residual</b> radioactive <b>materials</b> at the site. The primary radionuclides of concern in these remaining materials are expected to be radium- 226 and, to a lesser extent, natural uranium and thorium.
