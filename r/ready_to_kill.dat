5|$|During the night, Sideshow Bob {{reaches the}} {{houseboat}} and cuts it {{loose from the}} dock. Sideshow Bob then ties up Homer, Marge, Lisa, Maggie, and Santa's Little Helper to ensure they will not interfere with his plan. Sideshow Bob enters Bart's room, <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> him. Bart flees {{out the window and}} tries to escape, but he cannot jump off the boat. Sideshow Bob catches up to Bart and offers him a last request. Having noticed a sign saying that Springfield is fifteen miles away, Bart gets an idea; he compliments Sideshow Bob on his beautiful voice and asks him to sing the entire score of the H.M.S. Pinafore, to stall for time as the houseboat floats to Springfield. After the performance, Sideshow Bob advances on Bart again, but the boat runs aground, interrupting Sideshow Bob before he can finish him off. Sideshow Bob is arrested, and the Simpsons return home.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Hans has led a {{group of}} {{soldiers}} to the ice palace. Elsa's defenses are not enough and she is taken back to Arendelle's dungeon unconscious. At the castle, Anna's request for a kiss is denied by Hans, who reveals their engagement was merely a ploy to seize the throne of Arendelle. He locks Anna in her room without a fire, leaving her to die. Hans falsely claims that Anna is already dead and that they spoke their marriage vows before she died, making him the ruler of Arendelle. Olaf aids Anna while revealing to her Kristoff's love for her. Elsa also escapes into the fjord, her fears triggering a massive blizzard, but breaks down in shock when Hans tells her that she killed Anna and the blizzard stops. While {{the end of the}} storm allows Anna to reunite with Kristoff, she sees Hans <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> Elsa, and with her final breath, she stops him from killing her sister and inadvertently knocks him unconscious just as she freezes solid—a result of the earlier accident.|$|E

5|$|Mulder and Krycek head to {{a subway}} station, where Dr. Girardi is {{expected}} to arrive for Grissom's funeral. Mulder sees Cole there, and Cole seems to shoot Girardi, but this is shown to be in Mulder's head. In reality, Cole has captured Girardi and holds him hostage, about to show him a similar fate as his other victims. By searching surveillance footage, they track his location and find Girardi wounded. Mulder finds Cole, who is <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> himself. Krycek, believing Cole is holding a gun instead of the Bible he is actually holding, shoots him, and Cole dies of his wounds. Mulder and Scully find both of their files on the case missing. Krycek reports to the Smoking Man and others, telling them that {{the dissolution of the}} X-Files and the separation of Mulder and Scully has been ineffective, and their determination is only stronger. He also notes that Scully is a bigger problem than they anticipated.|$|E
25|$|The attackers {{released}} 150 to 200 people, including children, pregnant women, Muslims, some foreign-born theater-goers {{and people}} requiring health {{treatment in the}} early hours after they invaded.

500|$|The OUN {{decided to}} attack Polish civilians, who {{constituted}} {{about a third}} of the population of the disputed territories. The OUN equated Ukrainian independence with ethnic homogeneity; the Polish presence had to be removed completely. By February 1943 the OUN began a deliberate campaign of murdering Polish civilians. OUN forces targeted Polish villages, prompting the formation of Polish self-defense units (e.g., the Przebraże Defence) and fights between the Home Army and the OUN. The Germans encouraged both sides against each other; Erich Koch said: [...] "We have to do everything possible so that a Pole, when meeting a Ukrainian, will be <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> him, and conversely, a Ukrainian will be <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> the Pole." [...] A German commissioner from Sarny, when local Poles complained about massacres, answered: [...] "You want Sikorski, the Ukrainians want Bandera. Fight each other." [...] In massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia, beginning in the spring of 1943, between 60,000 and 100,000 Poles were killed.|$|E
50|$|In {{an episode}} that {{was added to}} the simple heroic chariot race, Pelops, still unsure of himself (or alternatively, Hippodamia herself), {{convinced}} Oenomaus's charioteer, Myrtilus, a son of Hermes, to help him win. Myrtilus was convinced by Pelops or Hippodamia promising him half of Oenomaus' kingdom and the first night in bed with Hippodamia. The night before the race, while Myrtilus was putting Oenomaus's chariot together, he replaced the bronze linchpins attaching the wheels to the chariot axle with fake ones made of beeswax. The race began, and went on for a long time. But just as Oenomaus was catching up <b>to</b> Pelops and <b>readying</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> him, the wheels flew off and the chariot broke apart. Myrtilus survived, but Oenomaus was dragged to death by his horses.|$|R
50|$|Pelops son of King Tantalus of Lydia, came {{to ask for}} {{her hand}} and {{prepared}} to race Oenomaus. Worried about losing, Pelops went to the seaside and invoked Poseidon, his former lover. Reminding Poseidon of their love ("Aphrodite's sweet gifts"), he asked Poseidon for help. Smiling, Poseidon caused a chariot drawn by winged horses to appear. Pelops and Hippodamia, very much in love, devised a plan to replace the bronze linchpins attaching the wheels to the chariot axle with fake ones made of beeswax. The race began, and {{went on for a}} long time. But just as Oenomaus was catching up <b>to</b> Pelops and <b>readying</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> him, the wheels flew off and the chariot broke apart. Oenomaus' charioteer, Myrtilus, survived, but Oenomaus was dragged to death by his horses.|$|R

However, the monks instead put down their weapons and went down at his feet.|$|R
500|$|It is then {{revealed}} {{that what has}} happened was actually a computer simulation that Stewie created {{to see what would}} happen if he killed Lois. Brian wonders if a hypothetical external viewer of the simulation would feel cheated by what was ultimately a [...] "dream sequence," [...] but Stewie argues that a computer simulation is totally different. Stewie then claims that he is not yet <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> Lois or take over the world, until the right time. Brian tells Stewie that hypothetical viewers would be angered by the simulation. Stewie counters by saying that at least the simulation didn't end like the final episode of The Sopranos, where it just cut to black mid-sentence. As Stewie is saying this, the scene cuts to black mid-sentence.|$|E
500|$|I {{would say}} it was a directorial {{collaborative}} effort. We went to the rainforest and that was interesting. Part of the reason was [...] I love Puerto Rico one of my favorite places ever and I did one of my favorite videos, 'Honey', in Puerto Rico at the El Conquistador hotel. I was involved every step of the way... I like a lot of the shots in the video... There was a moment where I had to do an additional water sequence with no director, just myself and a camera man with an underwater camera. I was looking at the take at 5 in the morning, [...] <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> me. But if we didn't have those shots there wouldn't be anything to cut away to, except me.|$|E
500|$|The song {{is carried}} by an [...] "anthemic" [...] {{sound and the}} [...] "riveting vocals" [...] of lead vocalist Dawn Michele. Bassist Wendy Drennen said that [...] "Unbreakable" [...] was about [...] "overcoming a {{defeated}} mentality and finding the power to remain strong amid the landscape, not allowing fear to hold us back from having victory over the things that used to control us". It is also lyrically based on the Biblical account of Jesus and the woman taken in adultery; the song's first line states, [...] "Where {{are the people that}} accused me?" [...] Richardson said, [...] "The people in charge were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> her, and Jesus speaks up for her, changes their minds and makes them feel ashamed for accusing her ... She knows she’s guilty, and yet she’s suddenly free and given a second chance." ...|$|E
50|$|Varuna {{agreed to}} the {{replacement}} {{on the basis that}} a Brahmin was a worthy substitute for a Kshatriya. King Harishchandra combined the sacrifice with his own Rajasuya ceremony. Four priests were called to conduct the sacrifice: Ayasya (the udgatr), Jamadagni (the adhvaryu), Vashistha (the brahman) and Vishvamitra (the hotar). However, all of them refused to bind Shunahshepa to the sacrificial post. Ajigarta then offered to bind his son for another hundred cows. Rohita accepted the offer, and Ajigarta bound Shunahshepa to the post. However, the priests refused to slaughter him. Ajigarta then offered to sacrifice his own son in exchange for another hundred cows. The prince agreed to his demand. As Ajigarta <b>readied</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> his own son, Shunahshepa prayed to the Rigvedic deities. With his last hymn, which invoked Ushas (the deity of the dawn), his bonds were loosened and King Harishchandra was also cured of his illness.|$|R
50|$|In the second, Pelops, still {{unsure of}} himself (or alternatively, Hippodamia herself) {{and of the}} winged horses and chariot of divine {{provenance}} he had secured, convinced Oenomaus' charioteer, Myrtilus, a son of Hermes, to help him win. Pelops or Hippodamia herself convinced Myrtilus by promising him half of Oenomaus' kingdom and the first night in bed with Hippodamia.

500|$|After his father's {{death in}} October 1962, Sellers {{decided to leave}} England and was {{approached}} by director Blake Edwards who offered him the role of Inspector Clouseau in The Pink Panther, after Peter Ustinov had {{backed out of the}} film. Edwards later recalled his feelings as [...] "desperately unhappy and <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill,</b> but as fate would have it, I got Mr. Sellers instead of Mr. Ustinov—thank God!" [...] Sellers accepted a fee of £90,000 (£ in [...] pounds) for five weeks' work on location in Rome and Cortina. The film starred David Niven in the principal role, with two other actors—Capucine and Claudia Cardinale—having more prominent roles than Sellers. However, Sellers's performance is regarded as being on par with that of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, according to biographer Peter Evans. Although the Clouseau character was in the script, Sellers created the personality, devising the costume, accent, make-up, moustache and trench coat.|$|E
500|$|Sir Lucious Left Foot was {{recorded}} {{over a period}} of three years, beginning on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in 2007. Big Boi has said that he [...] "always start working on albums on Martin Luther King Day. It's a good luck charm". The album was primarily recorded at Stankonia Recording Studio in Atlanta, Georgia, the studio used by OutKast for their previous albums. Additional recording took place at The Dungeon Recording Studios, The Slumdrum Dreamhouse, and King of Crunk in Atlanta, Dungeon East Studios in Decatur, Georgia, Instrumental Zoo in Miami, Florida, and Kush Studios in Palm Island, Florida. Big Boi discussed the Stankonia studio's environment in an interview for The Guardian, calling it [...] "comfortable but gritty enough to get you in a state of mind of being raw and <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> stuff", while noting that the sessions were accompanied by [...] "some candles, a little red light, maybe some crunk juice and a cigar; every now and then perhaps a little 'purple'". While searching for a new record label, he completed recording for the album. The album was mastered on May 27, 2010.|$|E

It was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following The X-Files and King of the Hill. The episode received critical acclaim; authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said: [...] "A rare case of both storylines being worthy of full episodes in their own right, this is a cracking episode which highlights the unduly neglected Rev. Lovejoy and makes you realize Homer isn't the only one <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> Ned Flanders! Great stuff." [...] In a 2000 Entertainment Weekly article, Matt Groening ranked it as his fifth favorite {{in the history of}} the show. Josh Weinstein described it as one of the best of the season, as well as being one of the most underrated episodes of all time. He also described the Mr. Sparkle commercial as his all-time favorite sequence. The fake Fruity Oaty Bar commercial from the film Serenity was partially inspired by the Mr. Sparkle advertisement. Since 2009, the show's new opening sequence includes Mr. Sparkle detergent with Marge's supermarket purchases.|$|E

Sundarar had asked Thyagaraja, the presiding form of Shiva at Thyagaraja_Temple of Thiruvarur to go his wife Paravaiyar disguised as a messenger. Kalikkama thought it blasphemy to use Shiva as a servant and rebuked Sundarar (the servant) who made Shiva (the Master) a slave. Thyagaraja wanted both his devotees to be reconciled. He afflicted Kalikkama with colic pain in his stomach. The god appeared in Kalikkama's dream and informed him that only Sundarar could heal him. Similarly, he ordered Sundarar to visit Kalikkama in Thirupungur and cure him. Sundarar sent a message to Kalikkama about his arrival and set off to Thirupungur. Kalikkama chose to die instead of being cured by the [...] "blasphemer" [...] Sunadarar. He pierced his stomach by his sword and cut his bowels out, giving up his life. While his wife <b>readied</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> herself, she heard about Sundarar's arrival and thought it was her duty to serve a devotee of Shiva. She hid her husband's corpse and welcomed Sundarar. Mindful of her husband's wishes, she ordered her people to inform Sundarar that Kalikkama was resting inside and did not need Sundarar's healing. However, the persistent Sundarar finally managed to see Kalikkama, who was lying in a pool of blood. Sundarar blamed himself for Kalikkama's suicide and decided to follow suit. As Sundarar was about to cut his throat, Kalikkama was resurrected by Shiva and stopped Sundarar. Sundarar prostrated before Kalikkama and begged his forgiveness. They hugged together and settled their differences. Sunadarar sang a panegyric in honour of the form of Shiva worshipped at Thirupungur as well as Kalikkama. The saints worshipped Thyagaraja in Thiruvarur together for some days, after which Kalikkama returned to Thirupungur. He spent rest of life serving Shiva at Thirupungur and finally reached Kailash, Shiva's abode after death.|$|R
