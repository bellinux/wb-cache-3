One of these studies deals with the characterization of the flow field (Pressure, Velocity and Temperature) in and around a car wheel model. One of the aims is to validate numerical tools to correctly predict the heat transfer {{in the vicinity of}} the brakes. These measurements (Pressure, Velocity and Temperature) are realized both inside and outside an isolated car wheel model.

40|$|Abstract. A macular hole is a {{full-thickness}} defect of retinal tissue {{involving the}} anatomic fovea, thereby affecting central visual acuity. Macular holes {{have been associated}} with myriad ocular conditions and originally were described in the setting of trauma. The pathogenesis of idiopathic, age-related macular holes remains unclear despite a litany of theories. Recently, Gass has described an updated biomicroscopic classification of macular holes and postulated that tangential vitreous traction may play a role. Cellular components surrounding the <b>rim</b> of macular <b>holes</b> may also contribute tangential traction forces and elevate the <b>rim.</b> Pseudomacular <b>holes</b> may be mistaken for macular hole lesions, despite careful clinical examination. Careful biomicroscopic examination with a contact lens and use of the Watzke and laser aiming beam tests help to ensure accurate diagnosis. Newer imaging technology, such as optical coherence tomography, helps distinguish true macular holes from pseudoholes and may provide additional insight into the pathogenesis of this condition. Surgical management with or without pharmacosurgical adjuncts can improve vision in select cases. The most common surgical complication is progressive lens opacification in phakic patients.

DESIGN: Retrospective, noncomparative case series. PARTICIPANTS: Eleven patients (9 female, 2 male; average age, 57 +/- 3 years) with spontaneous retinal detachment due to macular hole. All patients had a myopia higher than - 10. 0 D {{and had no}} proliferative vitreoretinopathy and no history of trauma. The average myopia amounted to - 17. 7 +/- 1. 1 D, and in eight cases, a large posterior staphyloma was present. Follow-up was 69 +/- 17 months. INTERVENTION: Patients underwent pars plana vitrectomy, temporary silicone oil tamponade, and laser photocoagulation of the macular <b>hole</b> <b>rim.</b> Silicone oil removal was performed after 2. 8 +/- 0. 8 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anatomic attachment of the retina was determined and visual acuity was measured. RESULTS: Final successful retinal attachment {{at the end of}} follow-up was achieved in ten eyes (91 %). Average logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) visual acuity increased from 1. 39 +/- 0. 12 before surgery to 1. 18 +/- 0. 13 after surgery (P 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Primary vitrectomy with temporary silicone oil tamponade and laser photocoagulation of the macular <b>hole</b> <b>rim</b> for retinal detachment due to macular hole in highly myopic eyes appears to provide a good long-term anatomic success and acceptable functional results...|$|R

40|$|Background: This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the special case of a putted ball intersecting a standard golf hole at its diameter. The velocity of the ball at the initial <b>rim</b> of the <b>hole</b> is termed the launch velocity and depending upon its value the ball may either be captured or it may escape capture by jumping over the hole. The critical value of the launch velocity (V) is such that lesser values result in capture while greater values produce escape. Purpose: Since the value of the V entered prominently in some theoretical studies of putting, the aim of the current study is to provide an original re-evaluation of V and to contrast our results with existing results. Method: This analytical analysis relies on trigonometry in conjunction with Newtonian mechanics and the mathematics of projectiles. The results of a recent study into the mathematics of a bouncing ball which included the notions of restitution and friction were also employed in the analysis. Results: If bouncing and slipping do not occur when the ball hits the far <b>rim</b> of the <b>hole</b> our analysis produces a value of V of 1. 356 m/s. When bouncing and slipping are present we find that V is at least 1. 609 m/s but increases beyond this value as slipping and friction become greater. Useful relations which relate the dynamics and geometry of the ball to V are provided. Conclusion: Since ambient conditions may influence the extent of bounce and slippage we conjecture that the value of V is not unique...|$|R

Due to its explicitness, the present solution for a crack can also serve as a benchmark to test the validity of various analysis approaches or assumptions to more complicated crack problems in magnetoelectroelastic media.

In eyes with refractive error, the result is often a sharper image. However, a second effect may appear at the common bridge between each two adjacent holes, whereby two different rays of light coming from the same object (but each passing through a different hole) are diffracted back toward the eye and onto different places on the retina.
