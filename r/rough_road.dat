25|$|For much of Albany's early years, {{from its}} colonial {{beginnings}} to well past independence, the South End {{was part of}} the city only politically, its only development being the <b>rough</b> <b>road</b> to the south that went through it. General Philip Schuyler's mid-18th century decision to build a mansion on his lands there was the first development of any kind. Later, after his death, the Erie Canal and its related industrial development brought so many immigrants to the area that the city had to expand its boundaries, making the South End an End in name only.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Greene {{and husband}} Al Raine were {{encouraged}} by the BC provincial government to pursue {{development of a new}} ski resort in the Melvin Creek Valley, between Mount Currie and Lillooet, both predominantly Native communities. Perhaps coincidentally, the <b>rough</b> <b>road</b> accessing the area was paved and upgraded at this time by the government as an extension to highway 99, the main road from Vancouver to Pemberton. Despite opposition from Native groups, backcountry recreationists, biologists, and environmental organizations, the project received approval from BC's Environmental Assessment Office in 2000, but has been stalled in a series of protests and blockades since.|$|E

25|$|The creek at Sunny Bay flowed {{only during}} the wet season, so a small pumping station was {{established}} further south at the creek emptying into Brown's Bay, pumping water through a narrow pipe along the foreshore to the camp at Sunny Bay {{and on to the}} Cape. A <b>rough</b> <b>road</b> was cut from Sunny Bay to False Cape, just above the foreshore, and the unit's one Blitz truck transported supplies and meals from the camp to the defence installations. A cutting was made for a small rail line which was used to winch supplies and equipment from the road and beach to the Battery Observation Post {{at the top of the}} ridge.|$|E
500|$|The entire complex was {{manned by}} several under-strength regiments of the Continental Army and militia units from New York and nearby states. A war council held by Generals St. Clair and Schuyler on 20 June {{concluded}} that [...] "the {{number of troops}} now at this post, which are under 2,500 effectives, rank and file, are greatly inadequate to the defense", and that [...] "it is prudent to provide for a retreat". [...] Consequently, plans were made for retreat along two routes. [...] The first was by water to Skenesboro, the southernmost navigable point on the lake. [...] The second was overland by a <b>rough</b> <b>road</b> leading east toward Hubbardton in the New Hampshire Grants (present-day Vermont).|$|E

[...] On July 5, General Arthur St. Clair's American forces defending Fort Ticonderoga and its supporting defenses discovered that Burgoyne's men had placed cannons on a position overlooking the fort. [...] They evacuated the fort that night, with the majority of the army marching down a <b>rough</b> <b>road</b> (now referred to locally as the 1776 Hubbardton Military Road) toward Hubbardton in the disputed New Hampshire Grants territory. [...] The day was hot and sunny, and the pace was rapid and grueling; most of the army marched [...] to Castleton before making camp on the evening of July 6.|$|E

500|$|Highway3 {{has existed}} in Alberta on {{generally}} the same alignment since the 1910s, with only relatively minor changes {{made to a}} <b>rough</b> <b>road</b> called the Red Trail that had been carved from Medicine Hat to Crowsnest Pass. [...] Difficult terrain on the south shore of Crowsnest Lake was a major obstacle in connecting {{the road to the}} British Columbia border. [...] On April29, 1903, a major rockslide buried the town of Frank and killed dozens, blocking the existing Red Trail. [...] Work immediately began to clear the railway of debris, but a new trail north of the slide was created, connecting Frank and Bellevue. [...] By 1906, a road had been carved through the rock to the south of the railway, replacing the temporary trail. [...] A formal opening of the highway was held on October8, 1917 in Blairmore. [...] Officials had aimed for the ceremony to be held in September, but final work on the road had been delayed by the Canadian Pacific Railway who were unhappy with the location at which the highway crossed the railroad, causing the originally surveyed route to be altered. [...] Minister of Public Works Charles Stewart had travelled from Edmonton for the event and stated that the highway was [...] "the only natural route" [...] for a trans-Canada highway, and would be in better condition if not for the difficult economic times. [...] Canada was embroiled in World WarI which ended in 1918, and gravelling of the highway began in the following years.|$|E

Nevertheless, Napoleon declared, [...] "I {{will not have the}} march of the army delayed for a single day. 20,000 men can feed themselves anywhere, even in a desert." [...] The march south from Ciudad Rodrigo to Alcántara via the Perales Pass was accomplished in five days in the cold rain. On this <b>rough</b> <b>road</b> through hills and ravines, half of the army's horses died, one-quarter of the soldiers straggled, and all but six artillery pieces were left behind. At Alcántara, Junot appropriated ammunition and provisions from the Spanish troops guarding the bridge across the Tagus.|$|E

2500|$|The 30-mile (48km) {{trip from}} Monterey to the Pfeiffer Ranch could take three days by wagon. It was a <b>rough</b> <b>road</b> {{that ended in}} present-day Big Sur Village and could be impassible in winter. Local {{entrepreneurs}} built small boat landings like what is known today as Bixby Landing at a few coves along the coast from which supplies could be received and products could be shipped from schooners via a cable hoist. [...] None of these landings remain today, and few other signs of this brief industrial period are visible. The rugged, isolated terrain kept out all but the sturdiest and most self-sufficient settlers. Travelers further south had to follow a horse trail that connected the various homesteaders along the coast.|$|E
2500|$|On June 10, 1755 British and American forces left Fort Cumberland, heading west. [...] On the 16th {{they arrived}} at Little Meadows, where Sir John St. Clair had made a {{temporary}} camp. [...] General Braddock, the overall British commander, was unaccustomed to frontier warfare and so asked Washington for advice, who made preparations to march on Fort Duquesne. [...] While in camp the famous Captain Jack and his forest rangers, men who dressed in leather and cloth and operated as Indians offered their services to Braddock for intelligence and harassing enemy Indians. [...] Braddock detested unconventional warfare and rebuffed their offer. [...] On the 19th of June, Washington and 1,200 troops moved out, accompanied by their Indian allies, towards Fort Duquesne. [...] General Braddock could not abandon the tactics of Europe, making slow progress on their march, only 12 miles in 4 days. [...] As Washington put it, “instead of pushing on with vigor, without regarding a little <b>rough</b> <b>road,</b> they were halting to level every mole hill, and to erect bridges over every brook.” [...] Nine miles from Fort Duquesne, French and Indian forces attacked, eventually defeating the British and mortally wounding Braddock in {{what came to be}} known as the Battle of the Monongahela.|$|E
2500|$|Regina Trench Cemetery is a Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery, {{situated}} {{astride the}} location of the trench, containing [...] and commemorations of men killed at or near the trench line during the First World War.

Most of the men buried at Regina Trench fell in battle between October 1916 and February 1917. The original portion of the cemetery (Plot II, Rows A to D) was established during the winter of 1916–1917. After the armistice in 1918, the Regina Trench location was selected as a [...] "concentration cemetery" [...] with mortal remains brought in from scattered graves and small battlefield cemeteries around Courcelette, Grandcourt and Miraumont. Unlike many CWGC cemeteries, where men are laid one-to-a-grave, many of the graves contain more than one burial and where two names are shown on the one headstone, it is necessary to count the individual names to find the correct grave location. The CWGC website states that Regina Trench Cemetery is located in Grandcourt but this is somewhat misleading, because while it is located between Grandcourt and Courcelette, it is most easily reached by a <b>rough</b> <b>road</b> that runs approximately [...] north-west of Courcelette village.|$|E
