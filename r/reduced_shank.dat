25|$|Thread forming {{and thread}} rolling are {{processes}} for forming screw threads, {{with the former}} referring to creating internal threads and the latter external threads. In both of these processes threads are formed into a blank by pressing a shaped tool, commonly called a 'thread rolling die' against the blank, in a process similar to knurling. These processes are used for large production runs because typical production rates are around one piece per second. Forming and rolling produce no swarf and less material is required because the blank size starts smaller than a blank required for cutting threads; there is typically a 15 to 20% material savings in the blank, by weight. A rolled thread can be easily recognized on fasteners that were formed from an unstopped blank because the thread has a larger diameter than the blank rod from which it has been made; however, necks and undercuts can be cut or rolled onto blanks with threads that are not rolled, and some fasteners are made from blanks with a <b>reduced</b> <b>shank</b> {{in the region to}} be rolled to maintain a constant major diameter from thread to unthreaded shank. Unless faced off, the end threads of a rolled fastener have a cupped end, as the surplus material in the tapering down final threads collapses uniformly over the end of the blank.|$|E
50|$|Gas {{checks are}} most {{commonly}} found {{in the form of}} a thin cup or disc made of a ductile metal. Copper, Zinc, Aluminum, and alloys such as brass have been used. A bullet designed to accept a gas check has a rebated base shank which permits attachment of the check without altering the maximum diameter of the bullet. The shallow cup-shaped check is mechanically attached to the <b>reduced</b> <b>shank</b> of the bullet by swaging.|$|E
5000|$|With {{respect to}} shape, stud bolts a.k.a studs are {{categorized}} into 3 basic types: [...] "Fully Threaded Stud Bolts", [...] "Tap End Stud Bolts", and [...] "Double End Stud Bolts". Each of these studs have different application. As name suggests, fully threaded studs have full body coverage with threads for full engagement of the matings nuts or similar parts. Tap end studs have threads at extreme {{ends of the}} body with unequal thread engagement length, while double end stud bolts have equal thread length at both ends. Apart from these there are stud bolts for flanges which are fully threaded studs with chamfered ends, and double end studs with <b>reduced</b> <b>shank</b> for special bolting applications.For studs that are not completely threaded, {{there are two types}} of studs: full-bodied studs, and undercut studs. Full-bodied studs have a shank equal to the major diameter of the thread. Undercut studs have a shank equal to the pitch diameter of the screw thread. Undercut studs are designed to better distribute axial stresses. In a full-bodied stud the stresses are greater in the threads than in the shank.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Intracortical microelectrodes play a {{prominent}} role in the operation of neural interfacing systems. They provide an interface for recording neural activities and modulating their behavior through electric stimulation. The performance of such systems is thus directly meliorated by advances in electrode technology. We present a new architecture for intracortical elec-trodes designed {{to increase the number of}} recording/stimulation channels for a given set of shank dimensions. The architecture was implemented on silicon using microfabrication process and fabricated 3 -mm-long electrode shanks with six relatively large m m pads in each shank for electrographic signal recording to detect important precursors with potential clinical relevance and electrical stimulation to correct neural behavior with low-power dissipation in an implantable device. Moreover, an electrode mechanical design was developed to increase its stiffness and <b>reduce</b> <b>shank</b> deflection to improve spatial accuracy during an electrode implantation. Furthermore, the pads were post-pro-cessed using pulsated low current electroplating and reduced their impedances by 30 times compared to the traditionally fabricated pads. The paper also presents microfabrication process, electrodes characterization, comparison to the commercial equivalents, and in vitro and in vivo validations.

40|$|Abnormal pain {{sensitivity}} {{is commonly}} associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and affects the life quality of ASD individuals. SHANK 3 deficiency was implicated in ASD and pain dysregulation. Here, we report functional expression of SHANK 3 in mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons and spinal cord presynaptic terminals. Homozygous and heterozygous Shank 3 complete knockout (Δe 4 - 22) results in impaired heat hyperalgesia in inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Specific deletion of Shank 3 in Nav 1. 8 -expressing sensory neurons also impairs heat hyperalgesia in homozygous and heterozygous mice. SHANK 3 interacts with transient receptor potential subtype V 1 (TRPV 1) via Proline-rich region and regulates TRPV 1 surface expression. Furthermore, capsaicin-induced spontaneous pain, inward currents in DRG neurons, and synaptic currents in spinal cord neurons are all <b>reduced</b> after <b>Shank</b> 3 haploinsufficiency. Finally, partial knockdown of SHANK 3 expression in human DRG neurons abrogates TRPV 1 function. Our findings reveal a peripheral mechanism of SHANK 3, which may underlie pain deficits in SHANK 3 -related ASDs...|$|R
40|$|Phytophthora nicotianae is {{a devastating}} root and stem {{pathogen}} of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) in South Africa. Growers strive {{to control the}} resulting disease, known as black shank, with metalaxyl treatments and resistant cultivars. The {{aim of this study}} was to consider whether development of metalaxyl resistance in P. nicotianae has contributed to poor disease control and if recently developed cultivars with high levels of resistance require metalaxyl for effective control. One hundred and thirty-two isolates of P. nicotianae were screened for sensitivity to metalaxyl. P. nicotianae isolates from most tobacco farms were metalaxyl sensitive. Growth of most isolates was inhibited completely at 1. 0 μg a. i. /ml. However, isolates from the MKTV tobacco producing area showed EC 50 values ranging from 1. 02 μg a. i. /ml to 3. 57 μg a. i. /ml. Twenty-one tobacco cultivars were planted and treated with and without metalaxyl in two different growing seasons to evaluate their resistance to P. nicotianae and the value of using metalaxyl. Hicks was the most susceptible cultivar. Vuma/ 3 / 46, LK 30 / 40 / 60 - 1, and LK 33 / 60 exhibited the greatest resistance to P. nicotianae. Use of metalaxyl in combination with moderately resistant cultivars such as NC 60 × TL 33 and LK 10 / 80 / 60 effectively <b>reduced</b> black <b>shank</b> in the field. Resistant cultivars were healthy and no significant difference between metalaxyl treated and untreated plants was observed...|$|R
5000|$|The {{straight}} shank {{is the most}} usual style on modern drill bits, by number manufactured. The whole of the drill bit, shaft and shank, is usually of the same diameter. It is held usually in a 3-jaw drill chuck. Bits of diameter too small to grip firmly can have {{straight shank}}s of larger diameter than the drill, which can be held firmly in a standard size colet or chuck. Large drill bits can have straight shanks narrower than the drill diameter {{so that they can}} be fitted in chucks not able to chuck the full diameter. Such a drill bit is called a reduced-shank or blacksmith's drill. For example, this allows a 1/2" [...] bit to be used in a pistol-grip drill's 3/8" [...] chuck. One particular type of reduced-shank drill bits are Silver & Deming (S&D) bits, whose sets run from 9/16" [...] to 1-1/2" [...] drill body diameter with a standard 1/2" [...] <b>reduced</b> <b>shank</b> for all. This allows drill presses with 1/2" [...] chucks to run the larger drills. S&D bits are 6" [...] long with a 3" [...] flute length.|$|E

40|$|Objective: As orthoses, and {{particularly}} ankle-foot orthoses, {{are widely used}} {{in the management of}} children with motor disorders, including cerebral palsy, we aimed to study their effect in normal children in order to add to normative gait data, which are essential for diagnosing, understanding and treating abnormal gait patterns. Design: We analyzed the effect of ankle-foot orthoses on classical gait parameters and lower limb segments coordination patterns in typically developing children in two age groups reflecting different neuromaturational/developmental situations. We recorded 3 D kinematic gait patterns in 9 children (4 - 5 years) and 11 children (9 - 10 years) walking barefoot or wearing bilateral solid ankle-foot orthoses maintaining the ankle joint angle at a neutral position. Results: Ankle-foot orthoses induced little change in cadence, step length, step width or walking velocity in younger children, though they altered intralimb coordination through the gait cycle. In older children, walking velocity was <b>reduced,</b> <b>shank</b> elevation amplitude increased, while lower limb coordination changed less significantly. In this age group, ankle-foot orthoses significantly reduced the variability of coordinative strategies. Conclusion: Ankle-foot orthoses affect the gait pattern in children with a typical development at different levels in younger and older subjects, but the resulting changes are minimal. © 2010 IOS Press and the authors.

40|$|With methyl bromide's phase-out, most growers {{have turned}} to {{alternative}} fumigants, particularly 1, 3 -dichloropropene (1, 3 -D) and chloropicrin. These alternatives are tightly regulated because they are classified as toxic air contaminants and volatile organic compounds; the latter combine with other substances to produce ground-level ozone (smog). Two ambient air monitoring studies were conducted to evaluate the potential of totally impermeable film (TIF) to <b>reduce</b> emissions from <b>shank</b> applications of chloropicrin and 1, 3 -D. In 2009, a study demonstrated that TIF reduced chloropicrin and 1, 3 -D peak emissions by 45 % and 38 %, respectively, but TIF did not reduce total emissions when it was cut after 6 days. In 2011, increasing the tarp period from 5 to 10 days decreased chloropicrin and 1, 3 -D peak emissions by 88 % and 78 %, and their total emissions by 64 % and 43 %, respectively. Concurrent dynamic flux chamber results corroborated the ambient air monitoring data. These studies provide regulatory agencies with mitigation measures that should allow continued fumigant use at efficacious application rates...|$|R
40|$|As the causative {{agent of}} black shank, Phytophthora nicotianae {{is a serious}} threat to tobacco {{cultivation}} in South Africa. Research presented in this dissertation describes pathogenicity studies and control measures for P. nicotianae on tobacco. Special attention is given to the population structure of P. nicotianae in South Africa. The implications of these genetic studies in breeding and selection programs against P. nicotianae were also evaluated. The first chapter of this dissertation represents a literature review on black shank and available control measures for P. nicotianae on tobacco. The mechanisms of pathogenicity and the life cycle of P. nicotianae are also treated in detail. Special reference is made to the maintenance of genetic diversity in Phytophthora species and particularly P. nicotianae. This literature review also highlights the fact that very few studies have been conducted to determine the genetic structure of P. nicotianae populations. The success of South African breeding programs for tobacco cultivars with P. nicotianae resistance is to some degree dependent on the selection of isolates with high levels of aggressiveness. The research presented in chapter two provides information on cultivar resistance and selection of P. nicotianae isolates for future breeding programs. Significant differences in levels of aggressiveness were found between P. nicotianae isolates. Furthermore, race 0 and 1 of P. nicotianae occurred in most of the tobacco growing regions in South Africa. Selected Race 0 and 1 isolates were thus used to evaluate black shank resistance of 11 commercially planted tobacco cultivars. Commercially planted cultivars differed significantly in their resistance to race 0 and 1. Cultivars LK 33 / 60 and OD 1 were highly resistant to race 0 but susceptible to race 1 while cultivars Vuma/ 3 / 46 and LK 3 / 46 were highly resistant to both race 0 and 1. Chapter three reports on the use of metalaxyl treatments combined with resistance in tobacco cultivars for control of P. nicotianae. One hundred and thirty two isolates of P. nicotianae were screened for sensitivity to metalaxyl. P. nicotianae isolates from most tobacco farms were metalaxyl sensitive. The results further indicated that the use of metalaxyl in combination with moderately resistant cultivars effectively <b>reduced</b> black <b>shank</b> in the field. The outcome of this study provided useful information for the implementation of an economically viable combination of disease resistance and metalaxyl as the basis for a P. nicotianae management program in South Africa. Chapter four of this dissertation deals with the development of a rapid seedling-' based screening technique to assay tobacco for resistance to P. nicotianae. This technique was validated by comparing it to a stem inoculation technique commonly used on adult plants. A strong positive correlation was found between results of the seedling assay and adult plant trials for all isolates and cultivars tested. P. nicotianae isolates could also be characterized as race 0 or I using both stem inoculation and the rapid seedling assay. The ability to screen large numbers of tobacco plants rapidly at the seedling stage allows for the testing of large germplasm resources in a systematic manner and under standard conditions. This may help in the timely development and release of more black shank resistant cultivars. In chapter five, a population study on P. nicotianae in South Africa is presented. One hundred and five P. nicotianae isolates were collected from the Northern Highveld and Lowveld regions, as well as from both citrus and tobacco hosts in South Africa. Levels of phenotypic diversity were determined in populations of P. nicotianae using RAPD markers. Among the 105 P. nicotianae isolates analysed 79 different RAPD phenotypes were found, where 35 of the isolates were found to be clonal. The high number of RAPD phenotypes (79) in relation to the sample size (105), the presence of both the Al and A 2 mating type and high levels of phenotypic diversity in the P. nicotianae population indicate a sexually outcrossing P. nicotianae population in South Africa. This sexual outcrossing may mean that P. nicotianae is likely to remain a constant threat to tobacco and citrus cultivation, since new genotypes with the potential to overcome resistance genes in commercial cultivars are likely to emerge. All chapters of this dissertation deal with some aspects of black shank control and breeding for resistance to P. nicotianae. This dissertation provides new knowledge on variation in levels of aggressiveness, race distribution and the development of metalaxyl resistance in the South African P. nicotianae populations. This also represents the first study on the genetic diversity of P. nicotianae populations in South Africa. The results presented here not only show the possible occurrence of sexual reproduction, but also indicate the presence of clones and discreet phenotypic groups of P. nicotianae. This information will be applied in future tobacco breeding programs to select breeding lines with resistance against a number of specific P. nicotianae races and phenotypic groups.

40|$|D-Aspartate (D-Asp) {{is a free}} D-amino acid {{detected}} in multiple brain regions and putative precursor of endogenous N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) acting as agonist at NMDA receptors. In this study, we investigated whether D-Asp (20 mM) in drinking solution for 1 month affects pain responses and pain-related emotional, and cognitive behaviour in a model of neuropathic pain induced by the spared nerve injury (SNI) of the sciatic nerve in mice. SNI mice developed mechanical allodynia and motor coordination impairment 30 days after SNI surgery. SNI mice showed cognitive impairment, anxiety and depression-like behaviour, reduced sociability in the three chamber sociability paradigm, increased expression of NR 2 B subunit of NMDA receptor and Homer 1 a in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The expression of (post synaptic density) PSD- 95 and Shank 1 was instead unaffected in the mPFC of the SNI mice. Treatment with D-Asp drinking solution, started right after the SNI (day 0), alleviated mechanical allodynia, improved cognition and motor coordination and increased social interaction. D-Asp also restored the levels of extracellular D-Asp, Homer 1 a and NR 2 B subunit of the NMDA receptor to physiological levels and <b>reduced</b> <b>Shank</b> 1 and PSD- 95 protein levels in the mPFC. Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant used also to alleviate neuropathic pain in humans, reverted mechanical allodynia and cognitive impairment, and unlike D-Asp, was effective in reducing depression and anxiety-like behaviour in the SNI mice and increased PSD protein level. Altogether these findings demonstrate that D-Asp improves sensorial, motor and cognitive-like symptoms related to chronic pain possibly through glutamate neurotransmission normalization in neuropathic mice...|$|E
