5|$|The tansy plant {{naturally}} {{contains a}} number of volatile components including 1,8-cineole, trans-thujone, camphor and myrtenol, with the quantities and proportions of each varying seasonally and from plant to plant. 1,8-cineole is a toxin believed to defend the plant leaves against attacks by herbivores. The tansy beetle is resistant to these chemicals. However, tansy is a <b>repellent</b> to other Chrysomelid beetles. For example, the steam distillate of fresh leaves and flowers of tansy contains high levels of camphor and umbellulone and is strongly <b>repellent</b> to the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata).|$|E
5|$|Numerous insects utilize {{defensive}} regurgitation. The eastern {{tent caterpillar}} regurgitates a droplet of digestive fluid to repel attacking ants. Similarly, larvae of the noctuid moth regurgitate when disturbed by ants. The vomit of noctuid moths has <b>repellent</b> and irritant properties {{that help to}} deter predator attacks.|$|E

50|$|Chemical <b>repellents</b> applied {{outdoors}} {{will have}} to be reapplied due to rain or heavy dew, or applied often to new plant growth to be effective. Failure to carefully follow the directions included with <b>repellents</b> can drastically diminish the effectiveness of the product. Some <b>repellents</b> contain toxic chemicals, such as paradichlorobenzene, and are ineffective unless used at hazardous concentrations. Other more natural <b>repellents</b> contain chili pepper or capsaicin extracted from hot peppers.|$|R
5|$|Pssst is {{an action}} video game {{developed}} {{and published by}} Ultimate Play the Game that was released for the ZX Spectrum in June 1983. In the game, Robbie the Robot has to protect his plant (a Thyrgodian Megga Chrisanthodil) as it is attacked by various insects, each of which needs a different <b>repellent</b> to neutralise it. Pssst was the second game to be released by Ultimate, after Jetpac.|$|E
5|$|Several coleopteran adaptations have {{attracted}} interest in biomimetics with possible commercial applications. The bombardier beetle's powerful <b>repellent</b> spray has inspired {{the development of}} a fine mist spray technology, claimed to have a low carbon impact compared to aerosol sprays. Moisture harvesting behavior by the Namib desert beetle (Stenocara gracilipes) has inspired a self-filling water bottle which utilises hydrophilic and hydrophobic materials to benefit people living in dry regions with no regular rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Some {{birds and}} insects use {{defensive}} regurgitation {{to ward off}} predators. The northern fulmar vomits a bright orange, oily substance called stomach oil when threatened. The stomach oil is made from their aquatic diets. It causes the predator's feathers to mat, leading {{to the loss of}} flying ability and the loss of water repellency. This is especially dangerous for aquatic birds because their water <b>repellent</b> feathers protect them from hypothermia when diving for food.|$|E
30|$|Substances used as <b>repellents</b> against insects were {{preferred}} to substances used as <b>repellents</b> against vertebrates, as the non-target organisms in the aquatic environment are mainly invertebrates.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Gold-standard {{tests of}} {{mosquito}} <b>repellents</b> involve exposing human volunteers to host-seeking mosquitoes, {{to assess the}} protective efficacy of the <b>repellents.</b> These techniques are not exposure-free and cannot be performed prior to toxicological evaluation. It is postulated that synthetic lures could provide a useful assay that mimics in-vivo conditions for use in high-throughput screening for mosquito <b>repellents.</b> METHODS This paper reports on a semi-field evaluation of <b>repellents</b> using a synthetic blend of human derived attractants for the malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto Different concentrations of known <b>repellents,</b> N, N diethyl- 3 -methylbenzamide (deet) and Para-methane- 3, 8, diol (PMD) were added into traps baited with the synthetic blend, and resulting changes in mosquito catches were measured. RESULTS All test concentrations of deet (0. 001...|$|R
50|$|The use {{of insect}} <b>repellents</b> {{containing}} DEET on skin or permethrin on clothing can be effective. Follow the directions on the container and wash off <b>repellents</b> when going indoors.|$|R
5|$|There are {{a number}} of other methods to reduce {{mosquito}} bites and slow the spread of malaria. Efforts to decrease mosquito larva by decreasing the availability of open water in which they develop or by adding substances to decrease their development is effective in some locations. Electronic mosquito <b>repellent</b> devices which make very high-frequency sounds that are supposed to keep female mosquitoes away, do not have supporting evidence.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{insecticides}} can {{be effective}} if application is targeted towards the vulnerable early-instar larvae. Two strains of the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis produce toxins which kill the larvae. Other forms of pest control, through non-pesticidal management are available. Feeding can be inhibited by applying antifeedants, such as fungicides or products derived from Neem (Azadirachta indica), but these may have negative effects on the plants as well. The steam distillate of fresh leaves and flowers of tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) contains high levels of camphor and umbellulone and these chemicals are strongly <b>repellent</b> to L. decemlineata.|$|E
5|$|High {{rainfall}} {{can cause}} widespread flooding, {{which can lead}} to landslides and mudflows in mountainous areas. Such floods cause rivers to burst their banks and submerge homes. The Ghaggar-Hakra River, which only flows during India's monsoon season, can flood and severely damage local crops. Floods can be exacerbated by fires during the previous dry season, which cause soils which are sandy or composed of loam to become hydrophobic, or water <b>repellent.</b> In various ways governments may help people deal with wet season floods. Flood plain mapping identifies which areas are more prone to flooding. Instructions on controlling erosion through outreach are also provided by telephone or the internet.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review the {{regulatory}} issues concerned with marketing <b>repellents</b> and to try to identify areas where changes may be needed. <b>Repellents</b> are covered unevenly by the various Federal and State pesticide laws. These laws were generally formulated to deal with pesticides and other highly toxic chemicals used to control 2 ̆ 2 pests. 2 ̆ 2 However, <b>repellents</b> discourage pests due to their disagreeable properties rather than their toxicity. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency has recently introduced reduced risk pesticide guidance which limits reporting requirements and hastens review. Those states that follow the Federal lead do not represent a problem. However, such states as California, Florida, and New York, that conduct their own detailed reviews, have not yet moved to adopt the Federal reduced-risk guidance and often require additional data beyond those required at the Federal level. In addition, foreign countries deal differently with <b>repellents.</b> Canada does not have biochemical or reduced risk guidance and therefore reviews <b>repellents</b> as regular pesticides. The European Union 2 ̆ 7 s new biocides law includes <b>repellents</b> and has significant information requirements. On the other hand, other countries such as New Zealand and Australia have no or minimal registration requirements for <b>repellents.</b> This uneven regulatory treatment makes introduction of <b>repellents</b> into the global market difficult...|$|R
5000|$|Synthetic <b>repellents</b> {{tend to be}} more {{effective}} and/or longer lasting than [...] "natural" [...] <b>repellents.</b> In comparative studies, IR3535 was as effective or better than DEET in protection against mosquitoes. Other sources (official publications of the associations of German physicians as well as of German druggists suggest the contrary and state DEET is still the most efficient substance available and the substance of choice for stays in malaria regions, while IR3535 has little effect. However, some plant-based <b>repellents</b> may provide effective relief as well. Essential oil <b>repellents</b> can be short-lived in their effectiveness, since essential oils can evaporate completely.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{a general}} {{perception}} {{that there is}} an abundance of nonlethal control technologies, the fact remains that there are fewer registered products and active ingredients for <b>repellents</b> in the U. S. than there were 10 and 20 years ago. This review discusses the technical issues relating to the discovery, formulation, and delivery of chemical <b>repellents,</b> and suggests future avenues of research that would improve our ability to develop effective chemical <b>repellents...</b>|$|R
5|$|Huge urban roosts {{in cities}} can create {{problems}} {{due to the}} noise and mess made {{and the smell of}} the droppings. In 1949, so many birds landed on the clock hands of London's Big Ben that it stopped, leading to unsuccessful attempts to disrupt the roosts with netting, <b>repellent</b> chemical on the ledges and broadcasts of common starling alarm calls. An entire episode of The Goon Show in 1954 was a parody of the futile efforts to disrupt the large common starling roosts in central London.|$|E

In {{its highest}} trim specification, the LS 430 {{included}} Lexus Link telematics, power door and trunk closers, heated and cooled front seats, and power reclining massage rear seats equipped with audio controls, power sunshade, a cooler, and air purifier. Several rear seat features adopted for the LS 430 {{had been previously}} available in Japanese market luxury vehicles. Safety features added to the LS 430 included front and rear side curtain airbags, park sensors, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and electronic brakeforce distribution. The vehicle also gained water <b>repellent</b> windshield and side glass.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies grow {{scattered}} or {{in groups}} on forest duff or humus under conifers, summer and fall, and may grow in rings or arcs. Thought to be a saprobic species (that is, obtaining nutrients from dead or decomposing organic matter), {{it has also}} been found on rotten wood. The fungus is able to protect itself from mycophagy by the springtail Ceratophysella denisana, a common mushroom feeder, by releasing <b>repellent</b> odorous compounds when it is injured.|$|E
50|$|Singapore {{residents}} are also arming themselves with anti-mosquito products including insecticides, <b>repellents</b> and electronic mosquito traps. For <b>repellents,</b> experts are recommending {{those with an}} active ingredients, such as DEET which provide more effective and lasting protection.|$|R
40|$|During {{bacterial}} chemotaxis, attractants and <b>repellents</b> {{alter the}} methylation {{levels of the}} methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs). These methylation levels represent a balance between two enzymatic processes: methylation and demethylation. In vivo experiments previously have shown that chemoeffectors influence the demethylation process; effects on the methylation system have not been reported. Here we show that in a cell-free extract of Escherichia coli both methylation and demethylation of the MCPs are affected by attractants and <b>repellents.</b> Attractants enhance methylation and inhibit demethylation. <b>Repellents</b> inhibit methylation and stimulate demethylation. The cell-free system {{provides an opportunity for}} further study of the mechanisms by which attractants and <b>repellents</b> influence the levels of methylation of the MCPs...|$|R
5000|$|Wear long-sleeve shirts, {{which should}} be tucked in, long pants, socks, and hats to cover exposed skin. Insect <b>repellents</b> should be applied over top of {{protective}} clothing for greater protection. Do not apply insect <b>repellents</b> underneath clothing.|$|R
5|$|Starfish may be preyed on by conspecifics, other starfish species, tritons, crabs, fish, gulls and sea otters. Their first {{lines of}} defence are the {{saponins}} present in their body walls, which have unpleasant flavours. Some starfish such as Astropecten polyacanthus also include powerful toxins such as tetrodotoxin among their chemical armoury, and the slime star can ooze out {{large quantities of}} <b>repellent</b> mucus. They also have body armour {{in the form of}} hard plates and spines. The crown-of-thorns starfish is particularly unattractive to potential predators, being heavily defended by sharp spines, laced with toxins and sometimes with bright warning colours. Other species protect their vulnerable tube feet and arm tips by lining their ambulacral grooves with spines and heavily plating their extremities.|$|E
5|$|The primary food of Galapagos {{sharks are}} benthic bony fishes (including eels, sea bass, flatfish, flatheads, and triggerfish) and octopuses. They also {{occasionally}} take surface-dwelling prey such as mackerel, flyingfish, and squid. As the sharks grow larger, they consume {{increasing numbers of}} elasmobranchs (rays and smaller sharks, including of their own species) and crustaceans, as well as indigestible items such as leaves, coral, rocks, and garbage. At the Galapagos Islands, this species has been observed attacking Galapagos fur seals (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) and sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki), and marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus). While collecting fishes at Clipperton Island, Limbaugh (1963) noted that juvenile Galapagos sharks surrounded the boat, with multiple individuals rushing at virtually anything trailing {{in the water and}} striking the boat bottom, oars, and marker buoys. The sharks were not slowed by rotenone (a fish toxin) or shark <b>repellent,</b> and some followed the boat into water so shallow that their backs were exposed.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{method of}} {{controlling}} A. aegypti is by eliminating its habitats. This {{is done by}} getting rid of open sources of water, or {{if this is not}} possible, by adding insecticides or biological control agents to these areas. Generalized spraying with organophosphate or pyrethroid insecticides, while sometimes done, is not thought to be effective. Reducing open collections of water through environmental modification is the preferred method of control, given the concerns of negative health effects from insecticides and greater logistical difficulties with control agents. People can prevent mosquito bites by wearing clothing that fully covers the skin, using mosquito netting while resting, and/or the application of insect <b>repellent</b> (DEET being the most effective). However, these methods appear not to be sufficiently effective, as the frequency of outbreaks appears to be increasing in some areas, probably due to urbanization increasing the habitat of A. aegypti. The range of the disease appears to be expanding possibly due to climate change.|$|E
40|$|The {{likelihood}} of a particular plant being consumed by an animal depends on its palatability, along with the availability and relative desirability of alternative foods. <b>Repellents,</b> therefore, {{can be applied to}} plants to render them less attractive than the alternative foods. In theory, animals then select for plants or foraging areas other than those protected with <b>repellents.</b> <b>Repellents</b> are socially acceptable nonlethal tools to reduce wildlife damage. New products are continually entering the market, but their efficacy varies greatly. Unfortunately, availability or even registration of these products does not equate to effectiveness. Some <b>repellents</b> contain aversive agents at concentrations below avoidance thresholds. Others may contain active ingredients to which the offending animal is indifferent...|$|R
2500|$|Insect <b>repellents</b> {{are applied}} on skin and give {{short-term}} protection against mosquito bites. The chemical DEET repels some mosquitoes and other insects. Some CDC-recommended <b>repellents</b> are picaridin, eucalyptus oil (PMD) and IR3535. Others are indalone, dimethyl phthalate, dimethyl carbate, and ethyl hexanediol.|$|R
40|$|Foraging deer can {{severely}} hinder regeneration {{of newly}} stocked stands.

5|$|The {{proliferation}} of phumdis, coupled with severe infestation {{of the lake}} by water hyacinth, has substantially impeded water circulation and caused an increase in siltation and deposit of pollutants in the lake ecosystem. The building materials used to build huts on the phumdi blocks sunlight from reaching the lower depths of the lake water, which has resulted in formation of vertical profiles of the lake water body and decomposition. Further, pesticides and insecticides are used for catching fish or as insect <b>repellent.</b> Degradation {{is in the form}} of benthal, which, as it decays, releases toxic gases such as methane, hydrogen sulfide, and reduces dissolved oxygen (DO). This causes the lake water to degenerate into a eutrophic condition, creating a dead water zone called the hypolimnion. Above the hypolimnion is a thin layer, known as epilimnion, where fish survive to some degree. The benthal is becoming increasingly thick, causing not only pollution of the lake water, but an increase in the shallow part of the lake.|$|E
25|$|Ant attacks {{represent}} a large predatory pressure for {{many species of}} wasps, including the Polistes versicolor.
