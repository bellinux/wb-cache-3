40|$|Although very diversified and {{abundant}} in Brazil, {{there is little}} knowledge on distribution of social wasps in the major part of Brazil. Here we report the first records for eight species of social wasps in Minas Gerais state: Mischocyttarus araujoi Zikán, M. funerulus Zikán, <b>M.</b> tricolor <b>Richards,</b> <b>M.</b> confusus Zikán, <b>M.</b> cerberus styx <b>Richards,</b> <b>M.</b> artifex (Ducke), Polistes pacificus flavopictus Ducke and Polybia striata (Fabricius). These species occurred in tropical savanna and semi deciduous forest. Key words: Mischocyttarus spp., Polistes sp., Polybia sp., inventory, diver-sity. In a recent perspective, biodiversity should be viewed and evaluated {{not only in terms}} of numbers of species, but also in aspects of interactions and species distribution, to facilitate a better preservation of natural ecosystems (Del-Claro 2004). In this sense, wasps, due to their biological characteristics, abundance, distribution and richness of interactions, are considered as a spe-cial group. Social wasps have important ecological functions, mainly actin...|$|R
