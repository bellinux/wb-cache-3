In my view, this practice also undermined the purposes of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act F(FIPPA), and the transparency and accountability principles that form the foundation of both Acts.

Executive Summary It is a mark {{of the success of the}} Revised Study of the Records Lifecycle that both the JISC Function and Activity Model and <b>Records</b> <b>Retention</b> <b>Schedule</b> advice were adopted with a good degree of success. Both the model and retention advice were found to be sufficient in scope and detail, and issues surrounding the application of advice and development of an institutional schedule centred on interpretation and method (surveying, presentation and role of the schedule). The Function and Activity model has many benefits but the apparent relevance of some functional designations could be misleading if the functioning of the model or the records is not given sufficient attention. The model becomes easier to apply when looked at ‘in the round ’ and with reference to the <b>records</b> <b>retention</b> <b>schedule.</b> The retention advice relating to HR records did not generally conflict with current practice and acted as an important starting point for discussion of retention, filing methods and digital preservation, particularly in the light of the DPA. The depth of surveying and a tension between the need to address issues of duplication, version control, filing method and potential electronic document management (requiring a good understanding of workflow and the current filing/retention of documents and series) and the need for a schedule not to simply reflect current practice in detail but provide guidance to move systems forward is a common theme addressed in the report. It was decided that the retention schedule should not be a static document or one that sits in isolation from other information and management resources. The project flags ways in which the schedule can be integrated at strategic and practical levels whilst highlighting some of the organisational issues faced in beginning an institutional schedul...|$|E

40|$|A foundation's {{archives}} preserve {{records of}} the programs, activities, products, governance, people, {{and history of the}} organization that may have enduring cultural, historical, research, or institutional value. Ideally, an archive should be part of a comprehensive records management program consisting of a records policy, a short-term <b>records</b> <b>retention</b> <b>schedule,</b> and an archive collection policy. As important as archives can be, little has been written about them in the foundation management literature. In truth, the creation and maintenance of archives, if undertaken at all, is typically an afterthought, and rarely considered a key information management responsibility. As the U. S. foundation sector matures, more attention must be paid to the retention and safekeeping of records that are important to historians who document not only the work, people, and institutions that foundations support, but also the very foundations themselves.

40|$|We live in {{a reality}} where {{official}} documents are born, revised and disseminated online. Most post-secondary institutions have <b>record</b> <b>retention</b> <b>schedules</b> to facilitate the transfer of official records with lasting historical value to the archives. Implementing similar practices in the online environment is challenging, {{in part due to}} an organizational culture that does not view websites as official university records, but rather as transactional, fluid spaces, despite the fact that such spaces are increasingly the only source of important documents. In addition, economic pressures and cutbacks in the university sector makes enterprise level electronic records keeping systems out of reach for many. These challenges cannot be met with a single solution. We need to work strategically to collaborate on long-term plans to ensure that born-digital records find their way into the archives. We will focus on our efforts within the library to capture and preserve a selection of websites and communications that document York’s campus activities, {{in a manner that is}} systematic and accessible.

40|$|This Schedule {{has been}} {{prepared}} to assist staff in disposing of semi-current and current records of the University. “Disposal ” refers to the process whereby records are appraised for either destruction or permanent retention. The Schedule is designed for disposal guidance, on an interim basis, pending agreement of individual retention schedules for the University’s Divisions, Responsibility Centres and Institutes of the School of Advanced Study. Disposal authority lies with the specific, approved retention schedules and not with this general schedule, which is only a guide. The schedule sets out disposal provisions for each category of record as follows: description of records, disposal instruction to staff (destruction or transfer), {{action to be taken}} by the Records Management Team (RMT) if the record has been transferred and the relevant legislative authority or records management guideline. The disposal provisions take into account administrative need, possible reference requirements by staff and potential long-term research and/or legal value.

The purpose is two-fold: first to better connect these students with their own individual college experience, and to also provide historical documentation for students of color at Iowa State University, which in the past, has been difficult to create or collect. One of the most difficult aspects of university life to create and/or collect documentation, is without a doubt, for the student experience. John Straw observes that “A significant part of the education process never gets into print or recorded anywhere but in the student’s memory. ”[1] In regards to recordkeeping practices, university offices, administrators, and faculty are much more consistent in retaining and transferring materials as part of the university’s <b>records</b> <b>retention</b> <b>schedule.</b> In addition, there are even fewer traditional papers or records documenting students of color at predominantly white institutions, such as Iowa State University. However, what little may exist or be created, is increasingly digital and electronic. This provides additional preservation challenges for the Archives.
