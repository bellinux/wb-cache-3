The new stepper motor has an embedded controller eliminating the need for a separate controller board. The reference target is heated to avoid possible emissivity (and hence calibration) changes due to moisture contamination in humid environments, as well as avoiding issues with ambient targets during ascent and descent.

One arm is connected to a steerable catheter sensor whose tip is a 1. 9 mm × 3. 2 mm thin film <b>resistive</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>detector</b> (RTD) sensor. We used a circulation system to simulate different flow rates at 39 °C for in vitro experiments using distilled water, tap water and saline.

40|$|Monitoring {{and control}} of {{temperature}} {{is of paramount importance}} in every part of our daily life. Temperature sensors are ubiquitous not only in domestic and industrial activities but also in laboratory and medical procedures. An assortment of temperature sensors is commercially available for such purposes. They range from metallic thermocouples to <b>resistive</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>detectors</b> and semiconductive ceramics, showing a negative temperature coefficient of resistance (NTCR). NTCR ceramic sensors occupy a respected market position, because they afford the best sensitivity and accuracy at the lowest price. Despite the enormous commercial success of NTCR thermistors, this area of advanced functional ceramics has not been recently reviewed. Nearly 100 years elapsed between the first report of NTCR behavior and the fabrication of NTCR devices. The manufacture of the first NTCR ceramic thermistors was problematic, as often the devices suffered from poor stability and nonreproducibility. Before NTCR ceramics could be seriously considered for mass production of thermistors, it was necessary to devote a large amount of R&D effort to study the nature of their semiconductivity and understand the influence of impurities/dopants and heat treatments on their electrical characteristics, particularly in their time dependence resistivity (aging). Simultaneously, from a technological viewpoint it was important to develop methods enabling reliable and permanent electrical contacts, and design suitable housing for ceramics, in order to preserve their electrical properties under conditions of variable oxygen partial pressure and humidity. These topics are reviewed in this article from an industrial perspective. Examples of common applications of NTCR thermistors and future challenges are also outlined...|$|R
40|$|This study {{develops}} a MEMS-based low-cost sensing platform for sensing {{gas flow rate}} and flow direction comprising four silicon nitride cantilever beams arranged in a cross-form configuration, a circular hot-wire flow meter suspended on a silicon nitride membrane, and an integrated <b>resistive</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>detector</b> (RTD). In the proposed device, the flow rate is inversely derived from {{the change in the}} resistance signal of the flow meter when exposed to the sensed air stream. To compensate for the effects of the ambient temperature on the accuracy of the flow rate measurements, the output signal from the flow meter is compensated using the resistance signal generated by the RTD. As air travels over the surface of the cross-form cantilever structure, the upstream cantilevers are deflected in the downward direction, while the downstream cantilevers are deflected in the upward direction. The deflection of the cantilever beams causes a corresponding change in the resistive signals of the piezoresistors patterned on their upper surfaces. The amount by which each beam deflects depends on both the flow rate and the orientation of the beam relative to the direction of the gas flow. Thus, following an appropriate compensation by the temperature-corrected flow rate, the gas flow direction can be determined through a suitable manipulation of the output signals of the four piezoresistors. The experimental results have confirmed that the resulting variation in the output signals of the integrated sensors can be used to determine not only the ambient temperature and the velocity of the air flow, but also its direction relative to the sensor with an accuracy of +/- 7. 5 degrees error...|$|R

Next, I describe my dissertation research on the development of a highly efficient fully integrated microfluidic platform for Sanger DNA sequencing, including automated thermal cycling, purification, concentration and in-line injection of the extension fragments for microchip capillary electrophoresis separation.

The DSC incorporated integrated nickel resistive heaters to apply on chip heating and for calibration. The cell metabolism experiments carried out with the DSC were performed using JM- 1 liver cancer cells and white blood cells (lymphocytes).

Further analysis was completed by obtaining the derivative of the DSC temperature curves. Two methods were explored: the direct derivative of the raw data curve and the derivative of the differential data curve. While both methods showed the ability to differentiate between the JM- 1 liver cells and the lymphocytes, the derivative of the differential data curve was superior due to the elimination of common mode signals. The differential method also allowed the determination of the heat rates of the cells.

40|$|Thermally induced {{mechanical}} stress, {{caused by}} different CTEs, {{is one of}} the major causes of failure for microelectronic devices. Especially for power electronics, where high voltages and currents lead to high temperatures because of power losses, it is important to know these loads for failure analysis and lifetime prediction. One opportunity to measure these is to replace the device with a surface structured test chip and use strain gauges to determine the stresses. In this work a concept for a test chip for silicon based power electronic devices is presented. To imitate a realistic behavior the chip contains elements for intrinsic heating. This reduces effort in measurement and the temperature profile in the assembled module is similar to the application. Unlike the homogenous profile for passive heat cycling using a climate camber.

Besides the heating elements strain gauges, three in each measurement cell oriented at a 45 ° angle, made from chrome nickel alloy and <b>resistive</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>detectors</b> made from nickel were implemented on the surface.

40|$|Flip chip is an {{electronic}} packaging {{technology that is}} becoming more popular in first level electronic packaging {{as the need for}} high density electrical interconnects becomes more relevant. The parallel nature of flip chip and harsh thermomechanical treatment introduces stress to the microchip and substrate. This is primarily caused by the application of high forces and mismatch in the thermal coefficient of expansion among the materials in the system. Other noise factors like misalignment, parallelism mismatch, warpage, pillar height variation, and temperature variation can weaken the bonding process. Unlike wire bonding, {{there is a lack of}} tools available for quality assessment of the flip chip process in-situ locally at the interconnect sites. There are however some existing wire bonding sensor tools which can be modified to be useful for optimization of flip chip equipment and processes. A 4 x 3 mm CMOS chip is designed to record XYZ force and temperature profiles in-situ on a 2 -dimensional surface during a simulated flip chip process. This was done as a low risk proof of concept to evaluate if the wire bonding tools can be adapted for a flip chip application. 95 μm square Al bond pads arranged in a square 8 x 8 array with 400 μm pitch have embedded piezoresistive force sensors and local top metal <b>resistive</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>detectors.</b> The chip is packaged with auxiliary wire bonds to deliver power and capture signals while operating under a bond head. Ball bumps 73 μm in diameter are deposited onto the sensor pads using 4 N Au wire. Z sensors are calibrated using a modified automatic wire bonder.

40|$|Wire bond {{reliability}} testing typically {{consists of}} aging bonds {{in a high}} temperature environment for long time periods, and removing samples at intervals to assess bond shear strength and characterize the bond cross sections. In this way, the degradation of the bond can be monitored at discrete time intervals, and it is determined whether the bond will be reliable during the specific service life. This process can be labour and time intensive. An alternative method is reported using an existing test chip that allows for contact resistance measurements and provides signals from piezoresistive integrated CMOS microsensors located around test bond pads. The sensors are sensitive to radial compressive or tensile stresses occurring on the bond pad due to intermetallic formation, oxidation, and crack formation at the bond interface. Two sets of identical test chips are bonded with optimized Au ball bonds and aged for 2000 h at 175 ºC. One set is connected to equipment which monitors signals from the stress sensors and the contact resistance of the bonds. The other set is destructively tested by shear tests and cross sectioning. It is found that the stress sensors are capable of indicating which stage of bond aging is experienced by relating the signal to the relative density of the intermetallic compounds (IMCs) and oxide which form during aging. This research offers a valuable new method for accelerating bond process development. By using the sensors to determine the stage of aging experienced and the magnitude of changes happening to the bond, the initial bond quality and bond reliability can be roughly characterized. A useful application is in comparing large samples of bonds made under varying conditions, and determining relative reliabilities of the bonds. A small sample size is required, as the sensors allow for complete continuous aging histories of individual bonds, which was not previously possible. A new test chip is designed for use in future studies which allows for contact resistance measurement, and provides stress signals for up to 55 bonds. A multiplexer integrated on the chip allows for measurements from one specified bond pad at a time.

40|$|Advances in {{research}} and technology are happening {{now more than ever}} in the biotechnology industry. Efficient methods for biological processes and better detection and treatment methods are constantly being sought by researchers. Collaboration among different fields of science and technology has brought us one step closer towards achieving this goal in this work. One such technology that has the capability of providing efficient methods and processes for biology is printed electronics. Printed electronics is an attractive paradigm for realization of biological microfluidic systems. The large area of these systems makes printing valuable from a cost perspective. Furthermore, since printing allows for easy integration of disparate materials on the same substrate through spatially-specific deposition, printed electronics is particularly useful for integration of diverse biological microfluidic functionality on the same substrate. 	While there have been instances of printed transistors and passive components, there have been no demonstrations to date of the critical components required for biological microfluidic applications or lab on a chip (LOC) devices. In this work, for the first time, we present all-printed gold heaters, gold <b>resistive</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>detectors,</b> and electrostatically actuated PDMS microfluidic valves designed for biological microfluidic applications. In addition, work on DNA sensors using printable organic (pentacene) thin film transistors (OTFTs) is also presented for use in LOC devices. 	Many biological applications require precise control and stability of temperature, which is demonstrated here through the integration of printed heaters and printed RTDs into a microchip bioprocessor system capable of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Flow rate measurements and dynamic characteristics of printed PDMS valves are also presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of these devices. With the 440 microns wide and 16 microns deep microfluidic channels used in this project, the valve with the thinnest PDMS membrane (55 microns) closed the channel completely (i. e. flow rate = 0) at a pull-in voltage of 250 V. This valve closed and opened in approximately 1. 5 and 5. 5 seconds, respectively. Pentacene surface has also been optimized to arrive at the best sensitivity for DNA immobilization and hybridization, bringing us a step closer in realizing printed OTFT DNA sensors for `tag-free' electrical detection. To summarize the sensor results, thinner films, higher substrate temperature, and higher input current during pentacene evaporation ensured that DNA immobilized in the channel part of the transistor and therefore provided for highest sensitivity of pentacene film to DNA. 	This work has thus successfully revealed the potential of printed electronics in real-world biological applications and has also paved the way for exciting future research areas for this technology...|$|R

This is combined with local and global processing in a hierarchical nervous system in order to manage the vast amount of data generated, in the form of our peripheral and central nervous systems, illustrated in Fig 1. With the goal of transferring similar functionality to composite structures the Structures and Composites Laboratory at Stanford University, in collaboration with researchers at UCLA, has developed a bio-inspired, micro-fabricated, embeddable stretchable network capable of hosting multiple sensors and computational suites, illustrated in Fig 2. Utilizing non-standard micro-fabrication techniques, an entire networked array of elements is fabricated simultaneously, composed of sensor nodes and interconnects that can include wires, temperature sensors, strain sensors, ultrasonic actuators, ultrasonic sensors, and signal processing. The substrate is then etched into a form that can be stretched and expanded to cover an area orders of magnitude larger than the original processing area and interfaced into local and global processors for data analysis [1]. Fig 3 contains before and after photos of an interconnect undergoing 1 dimensional extension. When embedded in a composite, this form of sensor network has the potential to provide localized sensor information about multiple aspects of the composite's condition, including temperature, deformation and damage, much like skin [2]. Due to the small physical size and dispersed nature of the network components, this network can be embedded into a composite laminate with minimal effect on the overall structural strength. However, {{due to the nature of}} the processing and use of a non-standard polyimide substrate, unique fabrication methods had to be developed to create this bio-inspired network. This paper presents an overview of the ongoing research and systems that have been integrated into this network in pursuit of a bio-inspired material capable of detecting temperature, damage, deformation and other traits. To date <b>Resistive</b> <b>Temperature</b> <b>Detectors</b> (RTDs), <b>resistive</b> strain gauges, piezoelectric elements, diodes, and microprocessors have been integrated into the network to serve these purposes. An un-stretched and expanded network consisting of piezoelectric elements and electrical interconnects can be seen in Fig 4 and Fig 5 respectively. Software interfaces, running on laptops, have served to process gathered information into a useful form mimicking the central nervous system. Additionally, synaptic transistors based on carbon nanotube (CNT) based composite that can process the signals from the network have been developed at UCLA, shown in Fig 6. These synaptic transistors can be tuned and are capable of providing signal processing, memory, and learning functions through modification of ionic fluxes in neurons and synapses.

40|$|Heat {{dissipation}} is {{a critical}} limitation {{in a range of}} electronic devices including microprocessors, solar cells, laser diodes and power amplifiers. The most demanding devices require dissipation of heat fluxes in excess of 1 kW/cm 2 with heat transfer coefficients more than 30 W/cm 2 K. Advanced thermal management solutions using phase change heat transfer are the most promising approach to address these challenges, yet current solutions are limited due to the combination of heat flux, thermal resistance, size and flow stability. This thesis reports the design, fabrication and experimental characterization for an evaporation device with a nanoporous membrane for high heat flux dissipation. Evaporation in the thin film regime is achieved using nanopores with reduced liquid film thicknesses while liquid pumping is enhanced using the capillary pressure of the 120 nm pores. The membrane is mechanically supported by ridges that form liquid supply channels and also serve as a heat conduction path to the evaporating meniscus at the surface of the membrane. The combination of high capillarity pores with high permeability channels facilitates theoretical critical heat fluxes over 2 kW/cm 2 and heat transfer coefficients over 100 W/cm 2 K. Proof-of-concept devices were fabricated using a two-wafer stack consisting of a bonded silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer to a silicon wafer. Pores with diameters 110 - 130 nm were defined with interference lithography and etched in the SOI. Liquid supply microchannels were etched on a silicon wafer and the two wafers were fusion bonded together to form a monolithic evaporator. Once bonded, the membrane was released by etching through the backside of the SOI. Finally, platinum heaters and <b>Resistive</b> <b>Temperature</b> <b>Detectors</b> (RTDs) were deposited by e-beam evaporation and liftoff to heat the sample and measure the device temperature during experiments, respectively. Samples were experimentally characterized in a custom environmental chamber for comparison to the model using R 245 fa, methanol, pentane, water and isopropyl alcohol as working fluids. A comparison of the results with different working fluids demonstrates that transport at the liquid-vapor interface is the dominant thermal resistance in the system, suggesting a figure of merit: [...] . The highest heat flux recorded was with pentane at [...] . and the highest heat transfer coefficient recorded was with [...] . not including the substrate resistance. However, the samples were observed to clog with soluble, nonvolatile contaminants which limited operation to several minutes. The clogging behavior was captured in a mass diffusion model and a new configuration was suggested which is resistant to clogging. Evaporation from nanopores represents a new paradigm in phase change cooling with a figure of merit that favors high volatility, low surface tension fluids rather than water. The models and experimental results validate the functionality and understanding of the proposed approach and provide recommendations for enhancements in performance and understanding as well as strategies for resistance to clogging. This work demonstrates that nanoporous membranes have the potential for ultra-high heat flux dissipation to address next generation thermal management needs. by Daniel Frank Hanks. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to carry out synthesis and characterization of series of dithienyl pyrrole (SNS) based conducting polymers and their applications as chemical gas sensors in the perspective of development of flexible multisensing radio frequency identification (RFID) system for perishable goods monitoring, the aim of the EU project ‘FlexSmell’. In this context, number of dithienyl pyrrole derivatives were synthesized and polymerized by both chemical and electrochemical methods. The synthesis of SNS based polymers with different functionalities on their backbone was undertaken in order to study the effect of electron donating/withdrawing substituents on the properties of the polymers. The SNS polymers with halogen atoms (F, Cl, Br and I) were also prepared and studied for their effects on the properties of the polymers. Flexible chemoresistive sensors were fabricated by electrochemical deposition of the SNS polymers onto interdigitated electrodes (IDE) substrates. The sensors were characterized against the analytes responsible for decay of perishable goods, such as humidity, ammonia, ethanol etc. The optical absorption spectra of the SNS conducting polymers showed well defined absorption bands due to π-π* transition or to the transitions among polaron, bipolaron and band states. These features correlate with the good conductivity shown by the investigated compounds when regarded in the frame of the conduction models for organic materials owning delocalised π bonds. The influence of the substituents on the electrical conductivities of the polymers was analysed. The polymers have their electrical conductivity linked to the electron donating character and electronegativity (for the polymers with halogen atoms) of the substituents. The polymers are also studied for their thermal stability, morphology etc. The SNS polymers characterized for their sensing performances against humidity, ammonia and ethanol showed linear increase in their resistances with the relative humidity and a power function one in respect with the concentrations of the other analytes. Attempts have also been made towards the synthesis of dithienyl pyrrole-dialkylbithiazoles copolymers for the synthesis of easily soluble and environmentally stable polymeric materials intended to be used for chemical sensing. The main goal of the FlexSmell project, development of flexible multisensing RFID system was achieved by working in collaboration with Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland, The University of Manchester (UK) and Holst Centre (The Netherlands). The multisensor platform was developed at EPFL whereas RFID tag at Holst Centre. Multisensor platforms with sensors of different transduction principles were fabricated by ink-jet printing of Ag-nanoparticle ink on flexible polyethylene terephthalate foils. The platforms have two IDE capacitors for humidity sensing, one <b>resistive</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>detector</b> for <b>temperature</b> measurement and two IDE resistive devices for ammonia and VOCs detection. The capacitive devices were functionalised with cellulose acetate butyrate or polyether urethane layers at University of Tübingen whereas resistive ones with polyaniline and polypyrrole layers at The University of Manchester. The RFID tag was integrated with the multisensor platform through a hybrid approach. In comparison with the currently available RFID sensing systems based on silicon technology, our prototype of low cost flexible multisensing platform with wireless communication capabilities represents a very promising approach for the next generations of smart RFID tags. Another part of the work explored the possibility to incorporate porcine odorant binding proteins in the structure of field effect gas biosensors through chemical and physical immobilization of the biological material on gold coated substrates. The concept has been tested by differential Kelvin probe measurements. This investigation was also performed in the frame of FlexSmell project for future developments of biosensor based RFID systems.
