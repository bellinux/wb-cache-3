40|$|A {{collection}} of Gaeumannomyces graminis var. graminis isolates obtained from symptomatic <b>rice</b> and <b>grass</b> plants {{in central and}} northern Brazil were studied in regard to pathogenicity on rice and cultural characteristics. For all isolates, only one type of lobed hyphopodia was observed both {{in the field and}} artificially inoculated plants. Perithecia were formed on artificial media and inoculated leaf sheaths. Hyphopodia were formed from ascosporic germ tubes. The hyphae under moist stress conditions produced dark brown chlamydospores that were initially hyaline. Large variation in the number of chlamydospores produced and duration of perithecia formation was observed among the isolates. Pathogenicity assays showed that 60 -day old rice plants were more susceptible than 35 -day old plants. The isolates from <b>rice</b> and <b>grasses</b> varied significantly in regard to disease severity on both rice seedlings and adult rice plants. In general, the isolates from rice were more aggressive than the isolates from grasses. Spontaneous infection of rice plants by ascosporic inoculum from perithecia on rice stubbles was observed in the greenhouse, suggesting their role as a source of primary inoculum in the field, which deserves further investigation. 201...|$|R

Members of the Magnaporthe grisea species complex cause blast disease {{on a wide range of}} gramineous hosts, including cultivated <b>rice</b> and other <b>grass</b> species. Recently, based on phylogenetic analyses and mating tests, isolates from crabgrass were separated from the species complex and named M. grisea. Then other isolates from <b>grasses</b> including <b>rice</b> were named as M. oryzae. Here, we collected 103 isolates from 11 different species of grasses in Korea and analyzed their phylogenetic relationships and pathogenicity. Phylogenetic analyses of multilocus sequences and DNA fingerprinting revealed that the haplotypes of most isolates were associated with their hosts. However, six isolates had different haplotypes from the expectation, suggesting potential host shift in nature. Results of pathogenicity tests demonstrated that 42 isolates from crabgrass and 19 isolates from <b>rice</b> and other <b>grasses</b> showed cross-infectivity on rice and crabgrass, respectively.
