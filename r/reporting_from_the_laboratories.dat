40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Nature Publishing Group via the DOI in this record. A recent <b>report</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> of Heidi McBride (McGill University) presents a role for mitochondria in the de novo biogenesis of peroxisomes in mammalian cells (1). Peroxisomes are essential organelles responsible {{for a wide variety}} of biochemical functions, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> generation of bile, to plasmalogen synthesis, reduction of peroxides, and the oxidation of very long chain fatty acids (2). Like mitochondria, peroxisomes proliferate primarily through growth and division of pre-existing peroxisomes (3 - 6). However, unlike mitochondria, peroxisomes do not fuse (5, 7); further, and perhaps most importantly, they can also be born de novo, a process thought to occur through the generation of pre-peroxisomal vesicles that originate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> endoplasmic reticulum (reviewed in (8, 9). De novo peroxisome biogenesis has been extensively studies in yeast, with a major focus on the role of the ER in this process. Comprehensive studies in mammalian cells are, however, scarce (5, 10 - 12). By exploiting patient cells lacking mature peroxisomes, Sugiura et al. (1) now assign a role to ER and mitochondria in de novo mammalian peroxisome biogenesis by showing that the formation of immature preperoxisomes occurs through the fusion of Pex 3 - / Pex 14 -containing mitochondriaderived vesicles with Pex 16 -containing ER-derived vesicles...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGiven reports {{showing a}} high {{prevalence}} of azole resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus, alternatives to azole therapy are discussed when a threshold of 10 % of azole-resistant environmental isolates is reached. This raises {{the issue of}} calculation of this threshold, either on the prevalence of azole-resistant isolates as a whole or on the prevalence of azole-resistant cases in populations at risk of invasive aspergillosis (IA). For isolate evaluation, there are high disparities in routine microbiological procedures for the isolation of A. fumigatus and azole resistance detection. There are also huge differences between the microbiological work-up for diagnosing IA. Some centres rely on galactomannan detection alone without actively trying to culture appropriate samples, which affects reliability of the figures on the prevalence of resistance and thus the threshold of resistance. Moreover, <b>reports</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>laboratory</b> could mix up figures from completely different patient populations: frequent azole-resistant isolates from pneumology patients and rare azole-resistant isolates from haematology patients. Therefore, to sum isolates from different specimens and different wards can lead to erroneous calculations for the restricted populations at risk of developing IA. In conclusion, assessing the incidence of azole resistance in A. fumigatus {{should be based on}} harmonized consensual microbiological methods and reports should be restricted to IA episodes in identified populations at risk of IA when the issue is to define an operational threshold for modifying recommendations...|$|R
40|$|The {{sodium salt}} of N-methyl-cyclohexenyl-methyl-malonyl urea (evipal) {{is one of the}} most {{interesting}} of the newer barbituric acid compounds. While it exhibits a rapid and high hypnotic coefficient and a very short duration of action, its toxicity, provided that it is properly administered, is considerably lower than that of the so-called short-acting barbiturates, e. g., nem butal, pernocton, and amytal. In these respects evipal bears closer resemblance to diethylepoxy-propionamide, diethylepoxy methylpropionamide and other epoxy amides being elaborated by Fourneau, Billeter and Bovet (1) than it does to the better known and more widely employed barbiturates. The enormous amount of literature appearing in recent months indicates that evipal has gained considerable popularity as a gen eral anesthetic in surgical procedures of short duration. This popularity is due to its wide margin of safety, speed of induction, good relaxation, minimal disturbance of circulation, short dura tion and negligible after-effects. However, very little work has been <b>reported</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>laboratories.</b> Because of this paucity of basic data we deemed it expedient to subject this new barbiturate to certain pharmacological tests.

After a landslide in a street of the hill, the regional administration ordered, in 1998, a detailed study of the hillside (7 square kilometres). The report is in three parts. The first one analyses the influence of human settlement on the landslide hazards. The second one studies all the environmental components in relation to the landslides. Finally, a synthesis map gathers the most important conclusions drawn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first two parts. The Belgian soil map is very useful when combined with geological and geomorphological data. This is called geo-morpho-pedologic approach. Analysis and comparison have been made with the geographical information system Arc/Info-Arcview. The landslide of the ""rue du Renard"" is located at the interface between discontinuous layers of clay (5 to 15 meters) and sand. Geology gives us a global evaluation of the layer of clay responsible for the landslide. Geomorphology increases the accuracy of location for the clay layer through several elements of the landscape such as superficial landslides, water seepage, concavities and convexities. Pedology matches up previous information through different kinds of data such as texture, ""natural soil drainage"", soil profile and derived series.

40|$|The {{performance}} {{characteristics of a}} method based on HPLC with postcolumn derivatization and spectrophotometric detection for the quantification of semduramicin in poultry feedingstuffs have been determined via a collaborative study. Semduramicin is a feed additive that is authorized for fattening chickens within the European Union at a minimum and maximum content of 20 and 25 mg/kg in feedingstuffs, respectively. The target concentration of semduramicin in the test samples ranged from 11. 5 to 45. 0 mg/kg. The study has been conducted with {{two different types of}} test material, namely, feedingstuff samples that have been previously ground in our laboratory and pelleted feedingstuffs. In the latter case, <b>the</b> <b>laboratories</b> participating in <b>the</b> study had to grind the samples prior to analysis. The obtained RSD for repeatability (RSDr) ranged from 2 to 10 % for the ground materials, and from 2 and 7 % for the pelleted materials. The RSD for reproducibility (RSDR) varied between 11 and 16 % for the ground materials, and between 12 and 15 % for the pelleted materials. These data indicated that grinding as an additional step in the analytical procedure did not influence the precision profile of the method.
