5|$|Born in Kentucky, Bowie {{spent most}} of his life in Louisiana, where he was raised and where he later worked as a land speculator.

5|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, as salvage {{operations}} became deeper and longer, an unexplained malady began afflicting the divers; they would suffer breathing difficulties, dizziness, joint pain and paralysis, sometimes leading to death.

Early <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease had been made {{at the time of}} Charles Pasley's salvage operation, but scientists were still ignorant of its causes.|$|E

The most documented region of the cane toad's invasion and subsequent effect on native species is Australia, where multiple surveys and observations of the toad's conquest have been completed.
