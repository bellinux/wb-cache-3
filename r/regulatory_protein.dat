MazG protein interacts with E. colis Era GTPase and is described as a 'nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase,' which hydrolyses nucleoside triphosphates to monophosphates. Later research showed that MazG is transcribed in the same polycistronic mRNA as MazE and MazF, and that MazG bound the MazF toxin to further inhibit its activity.|$|E

Furthermore, a strong relationship between age-related macular degeneration and polymorphism in the genes of certain complement components/complement <b>regulatory</b> <b>proteins</b> is now well established.

40|$|Complement <b>regulatory</b> <b>proteins</b> in glomerular diseases. Complement {{activation}} plays {{a critical}} role in the pathogenesis of many forms of glomerulonephritis. Complement activation leads to tissue injury through various mechanisms including the generation of chemotactic factors and activation of the resident glomerular cells following C 5 b- 9 insertion. Recent advances have disclosed the mechanisms of regulation of complement activation by discovery of a number of complement <b>regulatory</b> <b>proteins.</b> Decay accelerating factor (DAF), membrane cofactor protein (MCP), and complement receptor type 1 (CR 1) act by inactivating C 3 /C 5 convertase. They belong to the gene superfamily known as the regulators of complement activation (RCA), and share a common structural motif called a short consensus repeat (SCR). In contrast, CD 59 works by inhibiting formation of C 5 b- 9. The glomerulus is particularly well endowed with these membrane-bound complement <b>regulatory</b> <b>proteins.</b> DAF, MCP, and CD 59 are ubiquitously expressed by all three resident glomerular cells, while CR 1 is localized exclusively in podocytes. Expression of complement <b>regulatory</b> <b>proteins</b> can be changed by many factors including complement attack itself, and their expression levels are affected in various glomerular disorders. Studies utilizing cultured glomerular cells and animal models of glomerular diseases suggest important protective roles of complement <b>regulatory</b> <b>proteins</b> against immune-mediated renal injury. Recent progress in molecular biological techniques has made new therapeutic strategy feasible. Systemic administration of soluble recombinant complement <b>regulatory</b> <b>proteins</b> and local overexpression of complement <b>regulatory</b> <b>proteins</b> are promising therapeutic approaches...|$|R

25|$|The {{synthesis}} of cortisol in {{the adrenal gland}} is stimulated by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland with ACTH; ACTH production is, in turn, stimulated by CRH, which is released by the hypothalamus. ACTH increases the concentration of cholesterol in the inner mitochondrial membrane, via regulation of the steroidogenic acute <b>regulatory</b> <b>protein.</b> It also stimulates the main rate-limiting step in cortisol synthesis, in which cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone and catalyzed by cytochrome P450SCC (side-chain cleavage enzyme).|$|E
25|$|Like other lentiviruses, HIV-1 encodes a trans-activating <b>regulatory</b> <b>protein</b> (Tat), {{which is}} {{essential}} for efficient transcription of the viral genome.

40|$|This {{study reveals}} that high-copy {{satellite}} II (HSATII) sequences {{in the human}} genome can bind and impact distribution of chromatin <b>regulatory</b> <b>proteins</b> and that this goes awry in cancer. In many cancers, master <b>regulatory</b> <b>proteins</b> form two types of cancer-specific nuclear bodies, caused by locus-specific deregulation of HSATII. DNA demethylation at the 1 q 12 mega-satellite, common in cancer, causes PRC 1 aggregation into prominent Cancer-Associated Polycomb (CAP) bodies. These loci remain silent, whereas HSATII loci with reduced PRC 1 become derepressed, reflecting imbalanced distribution of UbH 2 A on these and other PcG-regulated loci. Large nuclear foci of HSATII RNA form and sequester copious MeCP 2 into Cancer-Associated Satellite Transcript (CAST) bodies. Hence, HSATII DNA and RNA have an exceptional capacity to act as molecular sponges and sequester chromatin <b>regulatory</b> <b>proteins</b> into abnormal nuclear bodies in cancer.

25|$|The {{removal of}} the {{inhibitory}} RuBP, CA1P, and the other inhibitory substrate analogs by activase requires the consumption of ATP. This reaction is inhibited {{by the presence of}} ADP, and, thus, activase activity depends on the ratio of these compounds in the chloroplast stroma. Furthermore, in most plants, the sensitivity of activase to the ratio of ATP/ADP is modified by the stromal reduction/oxidation (redox) state through another small <b>regulatory</b> <b>protein,</b> thioredoxin. In this manner, the activity of activase and the activation state of RuBisCO can be modulated in response to light intensity and, thus, the rate of formation of the ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate substrate.|$|E
25|$|Peripheral {{membrane}} proteins are membrane {{proteins that}} adhere only temporarily to the biological membrane {{with which they}} are associated. These proteins attach to integral membrane proteins, or penetrate the peripheral regions of the lipid bilayer. The <b>regulatory</b> <b>protein</b> subunits of many ion channels and transmembrane receptors, for example, may be defined as peripheral membrane proteins. In contrast to integral membrane proteins, peripheral membrane proteins tend to collect in the water-soluble component, or fraction, of all the proteins extracted during a protein purification procedure. Proteins with GPI anchors are an exception to this rule and can have purification properties similar to those of integral membrane proteins.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, {{also known}} as SS-A and SS-B, respectively, are {{commonly}} found in primary Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that affects the exocrine glands. The presence of both antibodies is found in 30–60% of Sjögren's syndrome, anti-Ro antibodies alone are found in 50–70% of Sjögren's syndrome and 30% of SLE with cutaneous involvement, and anti-La antibodies are rarely found in isolation. Anti-La antibodies are also found in SLE; however, Sjögren's syndrome is normally also present. Anti-Ro antibodies are also found less frequently in other disorders including autoimmune liver diseases, coeliac disease, autoimmune rheumatic diseases, cardiac neonatal lupus erythematosus and polymyositis. During pregnancy, anti-Ro antibodies can cross the placenta and cause neonatal lupus in babies. In Sjögren's syndrome, anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies correlate with early onset, increased disease duration, parotid gland enlargement, disease outside the glands and infiltration of glands by lymphocytes. Anti-Ro antibodies are specific to components of the Ro-RNP complex, comprising 45kDa, 52kDa, 54kDa and 60kDa proteins and RNA. The 60kDa DNA/RNA binding protein and 52kDa T-cell <b>regulatory</b> <b>protein</b> are the best characterised antigens of anti-Ro antibodies.

500|$|The protein {{products}} of the regulatory toolkit are reused not by duplication and modification, but by a complex mosaic of pleiotropy, being applied unchanged in many independent developmental processes, giving pattern to many dissimilar body structures. The loci of these pleiotropic toolkit genes have large, complicated and modular cis-regulatory elements. For example, while a non-pleiotropic rhodopsin gene in the fruit fly has a cis-regulatory element {{just a few hundred}} base pairs long, the pleiotropic eyeless cis-regulatory region contains 6 cis-regulatory elements in over 7000 base pairs. The regulatory networks involved are often very large. Each <b>regulatory</b> <b>protein</b> controls [...] "scores to hundreds" [...] of cis-regulatory elements. For instance, 67 fruit fly transcription factors controlled on average 124 target genes each.

Some of these genes are structural, directly forming enzymes, tissues and organs of the embryo.

The stabilized C3 convertase, C3bBbP, then acts enzymatically to cleave much more C3, {{some of which}} becomes covalently attached to the same surface as C3b.

[...] Thus, the alternative complement pathway is able to distinguish self from non-self {{on the basis of}} the surface expression of complement <b>regulatory</b> <b>proteins.</b> Host cells don't accumulate cell surface C3b (and the proteolytic fragment of C3b called iC3b) because this is prevented by the complement <b>regulatory</b> <b>proteins,</b> while foreign cells, pathogens and abnormal surfaces may be heavily decorated with C3b and iC3b.
