40|$|Three {{topics are}} covered {{dealing with the}} {{frequencies}} of a rotating beam, {{the use of the}} fundamental mode of a uniform cantilever beam, and the analysis of <b>resonance</b> <b>dwell.</b> Immensely high peak loads were generated by the code for <b>resonance</b> <b>dwell</b> indicating further need for including structural damping and for transient analysis capability. The effect of structural damping, newly incorporated in the code, is described...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{the multivariate}} mode {{indicator}} function (MMIF) method {{has been applied}} to simulated flutter test data in order to evaluate the potential application of normal mode force appropriation to flight flutter testing where there are many close modes and noise levels are severe. It is seen that the approach is capable of estimating accurate modal frequencies and force patterns from corrupted test data, for use in the appropriation of particular modes. Damping ratios are accurately estimated from a decay response following a <b>resonance</b> <b>dwell.</b> The complex mode indicator function (CMIF) has also been considered. The practical limitations of in-flight force appropriation are discussed, and the effects of the limited excitation possibilities are demonstrated by simulation. The number and position of exciters used are arguably the most important factors in determining the success of this technique. The application of force appropriation to flight flutter testing may well depend on the availability of small detachable vanes which allow direct excitation of all areas of the aircraft structure...|$|E
40|$|Disclosed are a {{nondestructive}} {{method and}} apparatus {{for determining the}} structural integrity of materials by combining laser vibrometry with damping analysis to determine the damping loss factor. The method comprises the steps of vibrating the area being tested over a known frequency range and measuring vibrational force and velocity vs time over the known frequency range. Vibrational velocity is preferably measured by a laser vibrometer. Measurement of the vibrational force depends on the vibration method: if an electromagnetic coil is used to vibrate a magnet secured to the area being tested, then the vibrational force {{is determined by the}} coil current. If a reciprocating transducer is used, the vibrational force is determined by a force gauge in the transducer. Using vibrational analysis, a plot of the drive point mobility of the material over the preselected frequency range is generated from the vibrational force and velocity data. Damping loss factor is derived from a plot of the drive point mobility over the preselected frequency range using the <b>resonance</b> <b>dwell</b> method and compared with a reference damping loss factor for structural integrity evaluation...|$|E
30|$|Numerical {{calculation}} {{is carried}} out to study optical properties and sensing performance of MIM structure sensor with patterned triangle unit. The enhanced local electric field and high absorption simultaneously is attributed to the strong lighting rod effect of Au triangle disks, plasmonic resonance coupling of electric resonance among Au triangle disks and magnetic <b>resonance</b> which <b>dwelled</b> in the SiO 2 layer, and high-density arranged triangle MIM arrays. The interaction among adjacent triangle disks of our structure and parameter effect on absorption peak is negligible. The thicknesses of the SiO 2 layer and top Au layer influence the position and amplitude of peaks, which are caused by adjusting electric dipoles and magnetic dipoles of MIM structure to match impedance, and the increasing of geometric dimensions of triangles when the thickness of SiO 2 /Au triangle layer increases. When the suggested structure matches its effective impedance well, the absorption is extremely high (>[*] 90 %). Due to the long tips of triangle Au arrays, the FWHM of peaks is very narrow, about 5  nm. The obtained RIS and FOM are about 660  nm/RIU and 132, respectively, for environment refractive index 1.33 ~[*] 1.36, which are excellent results compared with previous reports.|$|R
40|$|There is a {{constant}} urge from the European aircraft industry to reduce testing time of prototypes without loss of accuracy in the data. As a consequence, substantial changes concerning the testing strategy for modal survey tests, called ground vibration tests (GVTs) in connection to aircrafts, were proposed and applied during {{the last couple of}} years. Basic idea is to combine the benefits of the very reliable but time consuming phase <b>resonance</b> method (sine <b>dwell)</b> and the use of phase separation techniques on data stemming from swept-sine excitation. The idea of the current paper is to extend this concept introducing a combined approach also for linearity checks. Plotting modal parameters like the eigenfrequency {{as a function of the}} excitation level is the way to explore non-linear phenomena in GVTs for time being. Such plots are also called {em impedance plots}. Traditionally, these are produced using the phase resonance method by variation of the level of excitation energy, i. e. by harmonically exciting one single normal mode. The contemporary GVT strategy includes extensive broad-band excitation at various load introduction points. The authors recommend the use of swept-sine excitation which provide a high excitation level compared to random excitation and short testing time compared to stepped-sine excitation. The modes of the structure are identified from the resulting frequency response functions by means of phase separation techniques in parallel to the on-going measurement. The goal to extract as much information as possible from these data can be complemented by computing impedance plots for modes which have been identified at various excitation levels during the swept-sine testing depending on the excitation point and the exciter force. The paper explains in detail how the excitation level can be determined in case of swept-sine excitation. It gives examples of impedance plots from numerical simulations and complex large aerospace structures. The impedance plots are compared with curves stemming from phase resonance techniques. The achieved results are very encouraging...|$|R
40|$|The European {{aircraft}} industry is constantly {{calling for a}} reduction in the testing time of new aircraft without diminishing the accuracy of the data. As a consequence, substantial changes in the testing strategy of ground vibration tests (GVTs), were proposed and applied during {{the last couple of years}} (Fargette et al., Tasks for improvements in ground vibration testing of large aircraft, in: Proc. of IFASD, CASA/AIAE, 2001, pp. 121 - 133; G. Gloth, et al., Sound and Vibration 35 (11) (2001) 14 - 18). The basic idea is to combine the benefits of the very reliable but time-consuming phase <b>resonance</b> method (sine <b>dwell)</b> with the application of phase separation techniques to data stemming from broad-band excitation at various excitation points. The authors recommend the use of swept-sine excitation which provides a high excitation level compared to random excitation and a short testing time compared to stepped-sine excitation. The modes of the structure are identified from the resulting frequency response functions (FRFs) by means of phase separation techniques in parallel to the on-going measurement. In the practice of modal testing it is often observed that structures do not behave in a perfectly linear manner. This article investigates the influence of non-linear structural dynamics behaviour on the measurement results. An expansion of the test concept of swept-sine excitation is proposed which introduces a combined approach for linearity checks as well. The plotting of modal parameters like the eigenfrequency as a function of the excitation level is the manner in which non-linear phenomena in GVTs are presently explored. Traditionally these linearity functions are produced by harmonically exciting one single normal mode on different levels of excitation. The goal to extract as much information as possible from the FRF data can be complemented by computing plots of amplitude-dependent modal parameters for modes which have been identified at various excitation levels during the swept-sine testing, depending on the excitation point and the exciter force. The article expounds how the excitation level can be determined in the case of swept-sine excitation. It gives examples of linearity plots from numerical simulations and complex, large aerospace structures. The plots are compared with curves that stem from the phase resonance testing...|$|R
