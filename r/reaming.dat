25|$|Fixed {{renewable}} bushings {{are used}} in applications where the liner {{is meant to be}} used until it wears out. Slip renewable bushings are designed to be interchangeable with a given sized liner so that two different sized slip renewable bushings can be used in one liner bushing. This facilitates the ability to do multiple machining operations that require different inner diameter (ID) bushings, such as drilling and <b>reaming.</b> They usually have knurled heads so they can be easily removed.|$|E
25|$|As a {{consequence}} of British fears, the native infantry's long arms were modified by <b>reaming</b> out the rifling of the Pattern 1853 as a smooth bore bullet does not require greasing. This greatly reduced the gun's effectiveness, as did replacing the variable distance rear sight to a fixed sight. This became the Pattern 1858. However, due to the new thinner walls, the barrel would bulge and bursting was not an unknown problem. Furthermore, with the bayonet fitted excessive flexing became an issue. To remedy this, new barrels were made with thicker walls. This became the Pattern 1859.|$|E
500|$|When {{drilling}} deep holes, {{which require}} drilling fluid, the hole must be cased (fitted with a cylindrical lining), since otherwise the drilling fluid will be {{absorbed by the}} snow and firn. [...] The casing has to reach down to the impermeable ice layers. [...] To install casing a shallow auger {{can be used to}} create a pilot hole, which is then reamed (expanded) until it is wide enough to accept the casing; a large diameter auger can also be used, avoiding the need for <b>reaming.</b> [...] An alternative to casing is to use water in the borehole to saturate the porous snow and firn; the water eventually turns to ice.|$|E
50|$|A <b>ream</b> {{of paper}} is a {{quantity}} of sheets {{of the same size}} and quality. International standards organizations define the <b>ream</b> as 500 identical sheets. This <b>ream</b> of 500 sheets (20 quires of 25 sheets) is also known as a 'long' <b>ream,</b> and is gradually replacing the old value of 480 sheets, now known as a 'short' <b>ream.</b> <b>Reams</b> of 472 and 516 sheets are still current, but in retail outlets paper is typically sold in <b>reams</b> of 500. As an old UK and US unit, a perfect <b>ream</b> was equal to 516 sheets.|$|R

500|$|The {{episode was}} praised for its {{political}} satire. Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict called the episode a [...] "biting political satire {{in the guise}} of a children's oratory contest", that [...] "signifies that this season of the series will be all over the map, both emotionally and logically." [...] Gibron added: [...] "Everything, from the Reader's Digest rants to the formulaic speeches of the youths, has a resounding ring of truth. And once the story moves to Washington D.C, our nation's capital is in for a royal <b>reaming</b> as well." [...] Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend said the episode solidified the series' politically satirical voice as it [...] "bitch slapped the Bush administration" [...] that would later badmouth The Simpsons. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson, however, gave the episode a more negative review, stating that it [...] "has its moments but never seems like one of the series’ better programs. Part of that stems from its somewhat icky ending. The show exhibits a tone that feels more appropriate to a less biting and cynical series. It starts well with Homer’s obsession with Reading Digest. After that, the show seems more erratic, and it remains pretty average overall." ...|$|E
2500|$|Accuracy was {{consistently}} excellent, with little need for either case trimming or neck <b>reaming,</b> and Sharpe pronounced it [...] "my {{choice for the}} outstanding cartridge development of the past decade."

2500|$|The [...]300 Winchester {{uses the}} same case head design of the [...]375 H Magnum, its parent {{cartridge}}. The taper of the cartridge was reduced to provide the cartridge with more volume so as to increase its potential powder capacity. The lengthening {{of the case and}} the move of the shoulder forward over the [...]338 Winchester Magnum allowed for the <b>reaming</b> of the [...]308 Norma Magnum or [...]30-338 Winchester chamber to dimensions of the [...]300 Winchester Magnum. The down side was a neck which was shorter than the caliber of the bullet it fired, which meant that the bullet had to be seated more deeply in the case.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} sheets in a <b>ream</b> has varied locally over the centuries, often {{according}} to the size and type of paper being sold. <b>Reams</b> of 500 sheets (20 quires of 25 sheets) were known in England in c1594; in 1706 a <b>ream</b> was defined as 20 quires, either 24 or 25 sheets to the quire. In 18th- and 19th-century Europe, {{the size of the}} <b>ream</b> varied widely. In Lombardy a <b>ream</b> of music paper was 450 or 480 sheets; in Britain, Holland and Germany a <b>ream</b> of 480 sheets was common; in the Veneto it was more frequently 500. Some paper manufacturers counted 546 sheets (21 quires of 26 sheets). J.S. Bach's manuscript paper at Weimar was ordered by the <b>ream</b> of 480 sheets. In 1840, a <b>ream</b> in Lisbon was 17 quires and 3 sheets = 428 sheets, and a double <b>ream</b> was 18 quires and 2 sheets = 434 sheets; and in Bremen, blotting or packing paper was sold in <b>reams</b> of 300 (20 quires of 15 sheets). A mid-19th century Milanese-Italian dictionary has an example for a risma (<b>ream)</b> as being either 450 or 480 sheets.|$|R

2500|$|When <b>reaming</b> a pre-bored straight-sided hole, {{the spoon}} bit is {{inserted}} into the hole and rotated in a clockwise direction with a carpenters' brace until the desired taper is achieved. When boring into solid wood, the bit should be started in the vertical position; after a [...] "dish" [...] has been created and the bit has begun to [...] "bite" [...] into the wood, the angle of boring can be changed by tilting the brace {{a bit out of}} the vertical. Holes can be drilled precisely, cleanly and quickly in any wood, at any angle of incidence, with total control of direction and the ability to change that direction at will.|$|E
2500|$|Spoon bits {{consist of}} a grooved shank with a point shaped {{somewhat}} like {{the bowl of a}} spoon, with the cutting edge on the end. The more common type is like a gouge bit that ends in a slight point. This is helpful for starting the hole, as it has a center that will not wander or walk. [...] These bits are used by chair-makers for boring or <b>reaming</b> holes in the seats and arms of chairs. Their design is ancient, going back to Roman times. Spoon bits have even been found in Viking excavations. Modern spoon bits are made of hand-forged carbon steel, carefully heat-treated and then hand ground to a fine edge.|$|E
2500|$|Edison had {{introduced}} wax cylinders that played for nominally 4 minutes (instead {{of the usual}} 2) in 1909 under the Amberol brand. [...] These were made from a harder (and more easily breakable) form of wax to withstand the smaller stylus used to play them. [...] The longer playing time was achieved by shrinking the groove size and spacing them twice as close together. [...] In 1912, the Edison company eventually acquired Lambert's patents to the celluloid technology, and almost immediately started production under a variation of their existing Amberol brand as Edison Blue Amberol Records. [...] These new celluloid recordings were given a core made from plaster of Paris. [...] The celluloid material itself was blue in color, but purple was introduced in 1919, [...] "... for more sophisticated selections". [...] The use of the plaster core provided resistance to the shrinkage of the celluloid, but the playing surface is still liable to split if stored in less than ideal conditions. [...] The plaster core itself can deteriorate in conditions that are too damp or too dry. [...] Nevertheless, most Blue Amberol cylinders are, today, quite playable on antique phonographs or modern equipment alike (although the plaster core may need some <b>reaming).</b>|$|E
