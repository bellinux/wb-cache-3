50|$|On {{arrival in}} California, Hockney changed from oil to acrylic paint, {{applying}} it as smooth flat and brilliant colour. In 1965, the print workshop Gemini G.E.L. approached him {{to create a}} series of lithographs with a Los Angeles theme. Hockney responded by creating a <b>ready-made</b> <b>art</b> collection.|$|E
5000|$|Intellectually, {{upcycling}} bears some {{resemblance to}} the <b>ready-made</b> <b>art</b> of Marcel Duchamp and the Dadaists. Duchamp's [...] "Bicycle Wheel" [...] (1913), a front wheel and fork attached to a common stool, is among the earliest of these works, while [...] "Fountain" [...] (1917), a common urinal purchased at a hardware store, is arguably his best-known work. Pablo Picasso's [...] "Bull's Head" [...] (1942), a sculpture made from a discarded bicycle saddle and handlebars, is the Spanish painter's sly nod to the Dadists.|$|E

40|$|This thesis explores an {{experimental}} music approach to writing autobiography. As a composition, Pilgrim Carnival took {{place as a}} travelling series of events. The central event was a sound installation for a blindfolded audience. This essay is a description of that series of events {{as well as a}} discussion of similar precedents in interdisciplinary art. Beginning with Luigi Russolo and Marcel Duchamp, aspects of autobiography are examined in both noise music and the concept of the <b>ready-made</b> artwork. Body <b>Art</b> of the 1970 s, particularly the work of Marina Abramovic, is also tied into the idea of the ready-made artwork as an explicitly autobiographical example. The hybrid form of Pilgrim Carnival and the concept of ready-made autobiographical music create ongoing potential for new work...|$|R
40|$|Christopher Kul-Want brings {{together}} twenty-five texts on art written by twenty philosophers. Covering the Enlightenment to postmodernism, these essays draw on Continental philosophy and aesthetics, the Marxist intellectual tradition, and psychoanalytic theory, and each {{is accompanied by}} an overview and interpretation. The volume features Martin Heidegger on Van Gogh's shoes {{and the meaning of}} the Greek temple; Georges Bataille on Salvador Dali's The Lugubrious Game; Theodor W. Adorno on capitalism and collage; Walter Benjamin and Roland Barthes on the uncanny nature of photography; Sigmund Freud on Leonardo Da Vinci and his interpreters; Jacques Lacan and Julia Kristeva on the paintings of Holbein; Freud's postmodern critic, Gilles Deleuze on the visceral paintings of Francis Bacon; and Giorgio Agamben on the twin traditions of the Duchampian <b>ready-made</b> and Pop <b>Art.</b> Kul-Want elucidates these texts with essays on aesthetics, from Hegel and Nietzsche to Badiou and Ranciere, demonstrating how philosophy adopted a new orientation toward aesthetic experience and subjectivity in the wake of Kant's powerful legacy...|$|R
50|$|Since {{her work}} is most {{concerned}} with portraying a message and telling a narrative, Thoreson’s work fits into the genre of Conceptual/Fine-art photography most cleanly. Her inclusion of installment, staging, and editing creates images that almost resemble paintings and results in a mixed media piece. She takes elements of what is predominantly thought of as Fine Art, painting and sculpture, and applies it to photography. Her use of everyday objects borrows heavily from Marcel Duchamp {{and the concept of}} <b>ready-made</b> <b>art,</b> but her approach is significantly different.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} the {{aesthetic}} used in Avant-garde can include the artwork of Marcel Duchamp. For Duchamp's Fountain, he simply took a urinal and defined this as a <b>ready-made</b> <b>art</b> form. In this, he redefined artistic conventions by taking an item that was already made and employing the item for an artistic purpose. By doing this, he also employed a new technique {{in the production of}} art by taking something that was already produced and redefined the object he was using by taking a urinal and using it for art.|$|E
50|$|Roger Van de Wouwer {{has often}} use artistic trends to his advantage, but {{sometimes}} preceded them. His picture Tableau reproduces {{the definition of}} the word “tableau” (painting) as it is found in the dictionary, long before conceptual art made it common practice. This {{is only one of the}} multiple ways he questioned the meaning and function of images. Hence, the work of Roger Van de Wouwer is related to the style of Marcel Duchamp and his <b>ready-made</b> <b>art.</b> However, it also in contradiction with them, namely when he reproduced, with his paintbrush and scrupulous precision, the enlarged picture of an electronic circuit (La Transmission de la pensée) or used images with intriguing scientific origins. At the beginning of his career, more than merely seducing the eyes, every painting forced the mind to think in a different way. Later, he painted series, bringing together on the canvas elements in which the distance in meaning intensifies the power of the image: the cycles of combustion engines together with Manneken Pis, erected members combined with various crosses, diagrams of modern physics embedded in alchemical symbols, etc. There are numerous paintings based on «le défi et la révolte» (challenge and rebellion), as recommended by Paul Nougé. One of these paintings can certainly be understood as a manifesto: it depicts a boxing glove coloured as if it were a painter's palette (La Décantation). Together with :fr:Gilles Brenta, Van de Wouwer created a series of paintings (Douaniers sans frontières) whose attraction lies in the complementarity of the painters, each completing half-paintings started by the other. This project, completed in 1995, was the last important work of Roger Van de Wouwer, who died October 22, 2005.|$|E

Paper thread proves a unique material {{for him to}} utilise his extensive skills in textile craft techniques. The found objects Alexander combines with paper thread in this work titled "Binary Bind", are largely turnip graters purchased from an agricultural supplies store in Central Europe. Alexander likes to purchase unusual 'souvenirs' when he travels; agricultural, hardware and auto supplies stores seem to him to hold a vast collection of <b>ready-made</b> <b>art</b> objects {{just waiting to be}} subverted through the integration of paper thread...|$|E
40|$|Roula Partheniou has, {{for many}} years, been meticulously {{creating}} art objects {{that seem to}} 'imitate' real life objects. Ranging from bowls of spaghetti to office supplies, and cigarette cartons to vases, Partheniou’s sculptural arrangements are meant to trick us into seeing both her art, and the everyday objects they seem to copy, in new and inventive ways. The uncanny experience of seeing her works, presented often as installations the artist often frames as “constellations”, result from the artist’s blurring of the <b>ready-made</b> <b>art</b> object and the handmade art object. Partheniou’s solo exhibition at Dunlop Art Gallery will feature a new body of work currently under development. The works will inspire viewers to question how we understand, and arrive at particular assumptions about, everyday objects {{based on what we}} know about them from their visual compositions. What makes an object familiar? What are the aesthetic features of an object that quickly trigger us to assume what an object might be? " [...] Publisher's websit...|$|E
