Because the thickness of the doping layer is much larger than the radius of the nanowire, the SiNW layer is often completely doped after the high-temperature diffusion doping process. Furthermore, the enlarged surface area of SiNW structure usually results in a fairly thick dead layer on the top part of the SiNW layer with excessive doping concentration, which may bring serious Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) and Auger recombination [21, 22].

The junction area of a CNTs/Si cell is no more than the surface area of the anode (Si substrate). Therefore, rough architectures rather than planar ones are expected to improve the junction areas. Semiconductor nanowire/nanorods with <b>radial</b> <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions</b> make it possible to orthogonalize the direction of light absorption and carrier collection, and thus can enable efficient carrier collection in optically thick nanowire arrays even when minority carrier diffusion lengths are shorter than the optical absorption length. Although coaxial Si nanowire/nanorod <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> solar cells have high theoretical efficiencies, the cost of CVD growth of Si nanowires on Si substrates is high. Au as a catalyst used in the CVD growth of Si nanowire arrays also reduces the lifetime of carriers in silicon due to the presence of Au in the nanowire.

The indirect bandgap of Si (~ 1.12  eV), however, leads to poor optical absorption in the NIR region (750  nm[*]<[*]λ[*]<[*] 1100  nm), which hinders the development of Si photodetectors for optoelectronic on-chip integration. Semiconducting nanowires (NWs) might enable us to overcome the limitations of conventional bulk and thin film devices because of their unique geometrical advantages. NWs are known to possess an vastly larger optical cross-section than geometrical cross-section, due to the guided mode [4] and Fabry-Pérot resonances [5],[6], as well as anti-reflection effects [7],[8]. As a vertical platform of an NW array, spectral dependence of the optical response can be further modified via controlling its period, filling ratio, and symmetric arrangement [9]–[11]. Moreover, the <b>radial</b> <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions</b> offer an efficient carrier collection with the aid of orthogonal collection of charge carriers and incident photons [11]–[13]. Thus, there have been intensive studies to realize low cost and high efficiency NW-based optoelectronic devices [4]–[16].|$|R
30|$|From {{the above}} discussion, we have {{observed}} that the absorption of bulk Si film is much smaller than that of SiNWs array over the same wavelength range. This is because by precisely controlling the orientation (vertical vs. slanted), the size (nano- vs. microscale), density, and length of SiNWs' reflectivity can be reduced. It is also well known that porous SiNWs can reduce the back reflection up to 5.8 % in the wavelength range of 400 to 1, 000 nm [6], which leads to higher absorption and therefore can replace other surface-textured microstructure and anti-reflection coatings. At the same time, the high aspect ratio of nanowires and micropillars enhances absorption through superior light trapping mechanism, allowing significantly thinner structures and thus reduced material cost. This {{is especially important for}} Si because of the low absorption cross section inherent to its indirect bandgap, which requires tens to hundreds of times thicker materials for complete absorption compared to direct bandgap material solar cells.

Group III–V semiconductor NWs, especially GaAs and InP, are the ideal semiconductor materials to build such devices on low-cost platforms. The aim of this work was to fabricate and study the fundamental working mechanisms of single nanowire solar cell and photodetector based on novel <b>radial</b> <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> in a core-shell geometry. The Au-assisted GaAs NWs were grown and doped in situ using metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE). In this study, a unique lithography-free technique was employed on an ensemble of NWs to isolate the core (p-type) from the shell (n-type) on the growth substrate. Electron beam lithography (EBL) was used to make metal contacts to the single core-shell NWs. In that respect, specific contact schemes were developed to realize ohmic contacts between the metal electrodes and the NWs. Electrical measurements of single nanowire device revealed perfect I-V behaviour confirming the formation of <b>radial</b> <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> diode. For characterization of NWs, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photoluminescence (PL) and photocurrent spectroscopies were employed. Furthermore, surface passivation of NWs was identified as one of the key issues in functioning of the photovoltaic device as no photo response was detected without the same. The surface passivation of GaAs NWs with higher band gap AlGaAs layers resulted in dramatic enhancement of the PL intensity, and the photocurrent measurements of the device revealed a broad photo response in the visible spectrum range of the light, indicating a successful working of a single nanowire as a photodetector. However, although a functioning <b>radial</b> <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> was demonstrated, no solar response was detected from the single nanowire structure because of yet many unaddressed challenges such as high contact resistance, doping optimisation, absence of intrinsic region and unoptimised geometry.

An essential requirement for this research and development is the fundamental understanding of the electronic, electrical and optical properties of semiconductor nanowires. This thesis aims to address several critical factors that limit commercial integration of GaAs nanowire devices. The latter includes investigation of novel nanowire growth methods and understanding the charge transport properties in axial and radial structures. I grew gold-catalyzed GaAs nanowires via the vapour-liquid-solid mechanism using the metalorganic chemical vapor deposition technique. A thin GaP shell was used to passivate the sidewall surface states in GaAs nanowires. Electrical and optical measurements were carried out on the core/shell GaAs/GaP nanowires to demonstrate unpinning of the Fermi level by improvement in the nanowire resistivity and photoluminescence, respectively. Control of the surface recombination velocity in GaAs nanowires was also achieved using a thin lattice-matched InGaP passivating shell. This was determined through an enhancement of the minority carrier diffusion lengths in GaAs/InGaP nanowires measured using electron beam induced current technique.

SiNWs are 1 D material and there has been interest to incorporate them into photovoltaic cell design due to the wide availability of the material and existing processing infrastructure and direct path for charge transport afforded by the geometry. In addition to that SiNWs have higher absorption capability, nearly 70  %, which is much greater than that of bulk silicon [12, 13]. SiNWs show higher absorption since when the SiNW arrays are placed in orthogonal direction to light absorption and charge separation by fabricating <b>radial</b> <b>p–n</b> <b>junctions,</b> it enables efficient carrier collection and light trapping in optically thick nanowire arrays, even when minority carrier diffusion lengths are shorter than the optical absorption length [14, 15, 16]. SiNWs arrays also show comparatively low reflection losses than planner semiconductor [14] which definitely leads to higher absorption also. The advantage of using nanowires is that, like quantum dots we can tune the band gap to a specific part of the solar spectrum by simply controlling the chemical composition and the coverage density of the wire surface. Significant shrinking of band gap occurs if halogens such as Cl, Br, and I are used instead of H as surface passivation elements without changing the characteristics of semiconductor nanowires [17, 18]. In this paper, we have measured the optical absorption of SiNWs of different dimensions synthesized by electroless metal deposition (EMD) over the range or 200 – 1, 000  nm. Our finding shows that the absorption of SiNWs has greatly modified than that of the bulk silicon.|$|R

(2) The rate of carrier recombination in the depletion region must not be too large (for silicon this means that the carrier lifetimes in the depletion region must be longer than ~ 10 ns).

Although the measured minority lifetimes are shorter for the SiNW array with α-Si:H deposited at 15 W than those at 40 W, the largest Voc of 0.50 V was observed for 0.51 -μm SiNW passivated at 15 W for 30 min. The largest Voc of 0.50 V is similar to the results obtained from the nanowire device demonstrated by Jia et al. [13, 14].

Our technique can also be extended to other 2 D materials and to finer features that will lead to <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions</b> which span a large area, like a superlattice, that can generate a larger photoresponse. Our work creating abrupt <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions</b> is distinct from previous works that use a source-drain bias voltage with a single ionic gate creating a spatially graded <b>p-n</b> <b>junction...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{numerical simulation}} model of interface states in scanning capacitance microscopy (SCM) measurements of <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions</b> is presented. In the model, amphoteric interface states with two transition energies in the Si band gap are represented as fixed charges {{to account for}} their behavior in SCM measurements. The interface states are shown to cause a stretch-out and a parallel shift of the capacitance-voltage characteristics in the depletion and neutral regions of <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions,</b> respectively. This explains {{the discrepancy between the}} SCM measurement and simulation near <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions,</b> and thus modeling interface states is crucial for SCM dopant profiling of <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions.</b> No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{contrast}} to graphene, {{which is a}} gapless semicon-ductor, graphane, the hydrogenated graphene, is a semiconductor with an energy gap. Together with the 2 -D geometry, unique transport features of graphene, {{and the possibility of}} doping graphane, p and n regions can be defined so that 2 -D <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions</b> become feasible with small reverse currents. This paper introduces a basic analysis to obtain the current–voltage characteristics of such a 2 -D <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> based on graphane. As we show, within the approximation of Shockley’s law of junctions, an ideal I–V characteristic for this <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> is to be expected.
