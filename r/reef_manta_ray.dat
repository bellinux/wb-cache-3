50|$|The <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> (Manta alfredi) is {{a species}} of ray in the family Mobulidae, {{one of the largest}} rays in the world. Among {{generally}} recognized species, it is the second-largest species of ray, only surpassed by the giant oceanic manta ray (a currently unrecognized species from the Caribbean region also appears to be larger than the <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>ray).</b>|$|E
50|$|Reef {{manta rays}} are {{typically}} 3 to 3.5 m in disc width, {{with a maximum}} size of about 5.5 m. Long included in M. birostris, {{the status of the}} <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> as a separate species was only confirmed in 2009. The <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> is found widely in the tropical and subtropical Indo-Pacific, but with a few records from the tropical East Atlantic and none from the West Atlantic or East Pacific. Compared to the giant oceanic manta ray, the <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> tends to be found in shallower, more coastal habitats, but local migrations are sometimes reported.Manta birostris is similar in appearance to Manta alfredi and the two species may be confused as their distribution overlaps. However, there are distinguishing features.|$|E
40|$|International audienceLarge {{tropical}} and sub-tropical marine animals {{must meet}} their energetic requirements in a largely oligotrophic environment. Many planktivorous elasmobranchs, whose thermal ecologies prevent foraging in nutrient-rich polar waters, aggregate seasonally at predictable locations throughout tropical oceans {{where they are}} observed feeding. Here we investigate the foraging and oceanographic environment around Lady Elliot Island, a known aggregation site for <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> <b>Manta</b> alfredi in the southern Great Barrier Reef. The foraging behaviour of <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> was analysed in relation to zooplankton populations and local oceanography, and compared to long-term sighting records of <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> from the dive operator on the island. <b>Reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> fed at Lady Elliot Island when zooplankton biomass and abundance {{were significantly higher than}} other times. The critical prey density threshold that triggered feeding was 11. 2 mg m(- 3) while zooplankton size had no significant effect on feeding. The community composition and size structure of the zooplankton was similar when <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> were feeding or not, with only the density of zooplankton changing. Higher zooplankton biomass was observed prior to low tide, and long-term (similar to 5 years) sighting data confirmed that more <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> are also observed feeding during this tidal phase than other times. This is the first study to examine prey availability at an aggregation site for <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> and it indicates that they feed in locations and at times of higher zooplankton biomass...|$|R
50|$|<b>Reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> {{live in a}} more or less {{identical}} {{wide area}} with the possibility of short migration to follow the zooplankton. They therefore have a relatively sedentary behavior with precise areas for cleaning and feeding still within close proximity of coasts, reefs or islands.|$|R
40|$|<b>Manta</b> <b>rays</b> (<b>Manta</b> spp.) are plankton-feeding {{elasmobranchs}} {{classified as}} vulnerable to extinction on the IUCN Red List for Threatened Species. Despite increasing public and scientific interest in <b>manta</b> <b>rays,</b> major knowledge gaps concerning their movement ecology and dispersal capabilities remain. Here, we used pop-off satellite-linked archival transmitting tags {{to examine the}} horizontal movements and habitat use patterns of <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> (M. alfredi) departing Lady Elliot Island in the southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Tagged individuals moved across a latitudinal range of 1035 km, travelling up to 2441 km in 118 d, diving down to 294. 5 m and venturing up to 155 km off the continental shelf. Using random walk simulations, we showed that <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> spent significantly more time in an offshore region characterised by the mesoscale cyclonic Capricorn Eddy than would be expected by chance. A behaviour-switching state-space model suggested this area {{to be an important}} foraging ground for M. alfredi off eastern Australia. We document the movements of 1 individual using offshore waters between 2 known aggregation regions off eastern Australia. <b>Reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> thus not only occupy inshore continental shelf and shelf-edge waters but also use offshore environments to exploit productive hotspots and travel long distances. Our findings highlight the need to better understand their movement ecology for effective management. 14 page(s...|$|R

50|$|Because of {{its large}} size and {{velocity}} {{in case of}} danger (24 km/h escape speed), the <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> therefore has very few natural predators which can be fatal to it. Only big sharks, as for example the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), the great hammerhead shark (Sphyrna mokarran) or the bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas), and also the false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens) and the killer whale (Orcinus orca) are known to kill and eat mantas. The <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> may escape an attack, leaving it with {{a part of the}} wing missing.|$|E
50|$|The <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> has a pelagic {{lifestyle}} and feeds by filtering sea water {{in order to}} catch zooplankton.Research indicates that mantas probably may live to at least 50 years old.|$|E
50|$|The park {{is known}} for its {{wildlife}} including: green iguanas, humpback whales (from August to October), hammerhead sharks, whitetip <b>reef</b> sharks, <b>manta</b> <b>rays,</b> dolphins and multiple species of sea turtle that nest on the beaches of the islands.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{successful}} {{efforts to}} increase protection for <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> has highlighted the lack of basic ecological information, including vertical and horizontal movement patterns, available for these species. We deployed pop-up satellite archival transmitting tags on nine <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>rays,</b> <b>Manta</b> alfredi, to determine diving behaviors and vertical habitat use. Transmitted and archived data were obtained from seven tagged mantas over deployment periods of 102 – 188 days, including three recovered tags containing 2. 6 million depth, temperature, and light level data points collected every 10 or 15 seconds. Mantas frequented the upper 10 m during daylight hours and tended to occupy deeper water throughout the night. Six of the seven individuals performed a cumulative 76 deep dives (. 150 m) with one individual reaching 432 m, extending the known depth range of this coastal, reef-oriented species and confirming its role as an ecological link between epipelagic and mesopelagic habitats. Mean vertical velocities calculated from high-resolution dive data (62 dives. 150 m) from three individuals suggested that mantas may use gliding behavior during travel and that this behavior may prove more efficient than continuous horizontal swimming. The behaviors in this study indicate <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> provide a previously unknown link between the epi- and mesopelagic layers of an extremely oligotrophic marine environment and provide evidence of a thir...|$|R
40|$|<b>Manta</b> <b>rays</b> are {{classified}} as Vulnerable to Extinction on the IUCN Red List for Threatened Species. In Australia, a key aggregation site for <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> is Lady Elliot Island (LEI) on the Great Barrier Reef, ~ 7 km from the shelf edge. Here, we investigate the environmental processes that triggered the largest <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> feeding aggregation yet observed in Australia, in early 2013. We use MODIS sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll-a concentration and photic depth data, together with in situ data, to show that anomalous river discharges led to high chlorophyll (anomalies: 10 – 15 mg∙m− 3) and turbid (photic depth anomalies: − 15 m) river plumes extending out to LEI, and that these became entrained offshore around the periphery of an active cyclonic eddy. Eddy dynamics led to cold bottom intrusions along the shelf edge (6 °C temperature decrease), and at LEI (5 °C temperature decrease). Strongest SST gradients (> 1 °C∙km− 1) were at the convergent frontal zone between the shelf and eddy-influenced waters, directly overlying LEI. Here, the front intensified on the spring ebb tide to attract and shape the aggregation pattern of foraging <b>manta</b> <b>rays.</b> Future research could focus on mapping the probability and persistence of these ecologically significant frontal zones via remote sensing to aid the management and conservation of marine species...|$|R

50|$|The <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> has a {{widespread}} distribution in tropical and subtropical {{parts of the}} Indo-Pacific, with few records from the warm East Atlantic and none in the West Atlantic or East Pacific. It {{can be observed in}} several often-visited regions such as Hawaii, Fiji, French Polynesia, Micronesia, Bali, Komodo, Maldives, Mozambique, Australia and the Philippines. It is primarily found in coastal regions.|$|E
40|$|Shark bite {{injuries}} on <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> <b>Manta</b> alfredi off {{the coast}} of Inhambane, Mozambique, were examined over a three-year period (2003 - 2006). The frequency and seasonality of attacks, the rate of wound healing, and the possible identities of attackers were explored. This study presents the first examination of bite wounds on <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> in the wild and the role sharks may play in the natural mortality of this species. The reported incidence of shark-inflicted injuries is high with over three-quarters of the sampled population affected. In total, 571 bite injuries were observed on 283 identified individuals. The number of bite injuries varied from one to seven, with a mean of 1. 54 bite wounds. There {{was no significant difference in}} the frequency of bite injuries in male and female rays. The majority (96 %) of the observed bite wounds were healed. Fresh wounds occurred throughout the year, with no obvious seasonality. The bull shark Carcharhinus leucas and tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvier are suggested as the primary mediators of attacks, although up to 11 other shark species are listed as potential attackers. The majority of the bite marks (96 %) occurred to the most posterior region of the body, specifically the posterior edges of the pectoral and pelvic fins, with many injuries likely having a negative impact on the reproductive abilities and fitness of the rays...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of a photographic identification methodology using the unique ventral surface markings (natural spot patterns) of an observed population in southern Mozambique enabled {{many aspects of the}} reproductive ecology of <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> <b>Manta</b> alfredi to be examined. The region encompassing the study site was identified as a mating ground for M. alfredi based on observations of mating events and fresh mating scars on females. The distribution of these pectoral fin scars was highly biased and indicated a strong lateralized behavioural trait, with 99 % of these scars occurring only on the left pectoral fin. No other elasmobranch has been reported to display behavioural lateralization. The study region also acts as a birthing ground, with individuals typically giving birth in the austral summer period after a gestation of c. 1 year. Reproductive periodicity in M. alfredi was most commonly biennial, but a few individuals were pregnant in consecutive years, confirming an annual ovulatory cycle. The production of a single pup appears to be the normal situation, although observations in the wild as well as during opportunistic dissections of individuals killed by fisheries revealed that two pups are conceived on occasion. Many aspects of the study have contributed to the limited baseline data currently available for this species and have highlighted the potential need for more conservative conservation strategies...|$|R
40|$|Many well-studied elasmobranch {{populations have}} {{recently}} exhibited significant decline. The limited data related to fisheries and sightings for many unstudied or poorly understood populations indicate {{that these are}} also suffering. Directed fisheries and more cryptic threats such as entanglement and vessel strike represent significant risk to mobulid rays, arguably {{one of the most}} vulnerable elasmobranch groups. Very little information currently exists describing the basic ecology of <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> or quantifying anthropogenic threats and impacts; however, recent efforts have drastically improved the body of knowledge available for these species, including oceanographic influences on movement, seasonal migration, and mating behaviors. Nevertheless, Red Sea mantas remain completely enigmatic. In this thesis, Chapter 1 details results from tagging 18 <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> <b>Manta</b> alfredi in the eastern Red Sea using satellite and acoustic tag technology and demonstrates that mantas occupy areas with high human traffic. The combined satellite and acoustic techniques define both regional movements and ‘hotspots’ of habitat use where there is significant potential for manta-human interaction. I also present opportunistic sighting data that corroborate anthropogenic impacts on this population. Chapter 2 explores the vertical component of the nine satellite tags that were deployed on Manta alfredi as described in the previous chapter. Seven tags returned adequate data for analysis. Three of the seven were physically recovered yielding full archival datasets of depth, temperature, and light levels every 10 - 15 seconds for over 2. 6 5 million cumulative data points. Mantas frequented the upper 10 m during the day and occupied deeper water through nocturnal periods. Individuals also exhibited deep diving behavior as deep as 432 m, extending the known depth range of the species. An investigation of 76 high-resolution deep dives suggests gliding is a significant behavioral component of these dives and may provide an efficient mechanism for travel compared to continuous horizontal swimming. This study is the first to employ satellite telemetry techniques on Manta alfredi and is the only study directed at mobulids in the Red Sea. A holistic understanding of these behaviors is essential for developing and implementing appropriate management techniques, and this work is particularly timely in light of recent international trade regulation as mantas were listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species...|$|R
50|$|Difference {{can also}} be made by their ventral coloration, the <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> has a white belly with often spots between the branchial gill slits and other spots spread across {{trailing}} edge of pectoral fins and abdominal region. The oceanic manta ray has also a white ventral coloration with spots clustered around lower region of its abdomen. Its cephalic fins, inside of its mouth and its gill slits are often black.|$|E
50|$|The <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> is {{considered}} to be vulnerable by the IUCN in its Red List of Threatened Species because their population decreases drastically over the last twenty years due to overfishing. Whatever is the type of fishing (artisanal, targeted or bycatch),the impact of the latter on a population which has a low fecondity rate, a long gestation period with mainly a pup at the time, a late sexual maturity can only be seriously detrimental to the species that can not compensate for the losses over several decades.In recent years, fishing for manta rays is significantly boosted by prices of their gill rakers on the market of the traditional Chinese medicine. Pseudo-medicinal virtues assigned to them without proven scientific basis and a clever marketing strategy generate significant demand.|$|E
50|$|The <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>ray,</b> as the oceanic manta ray, is ovoviviparous. After mating, the fertilized eggs develop {{within the}} female's oviduct. At first, they are {{enclosed}} in an egg {{case and the}} developing embryos feeds on the yolk. After the egg hatches, the pup remains in the oviduct and receives nourishment from a milky secretion. As {{it does not have}} a placental connection with its mother, the pup relies on buccal pumping to obtain oxygen. The brood size is usually one but occasionally two embryos develop simultaneously. The gestation period is thought to be 12-13 months. When fully developed, the pup is 1.4 m in disc width, weighs 9 kg and resembles an adult. It is expelled from the oviduct, usually near the coast, and it remains in a shallow-water environment for a few years while it grows.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{increasing}} popularity of this dive the conservation {{and protection of}} <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> has become a priority for dive operators and organizations. <b>Manta</b> <b>rays</b> {{in other parts of}} the Pacific Ocean have been hunted by fishermen as a result of {{the increasing}} demand for <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> gill plates.

50|$|The <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> {{can grow}} to a disc size {{of up to}} 5 m but average size {{commonly}} observed is 3 to 3.5 m.It is dorsoventrally flattened and has large, triangular pectoral fins {{on either side of}} the disc. At the front, it has a pair of cephalic fins which are forward extensions of the pectoral fins. These can be rolled up in a spiral for swimming or can be flared out to channel water into the large, forward-pointing, rectangular mouth when the animal is feeding.The eyes and the spiracles are on the side of the head behind the cephalic fins, and the 5 gill slits are on the ventral (under) surface. It has a small dorsal fin and the tail is long and whip-like. The manta ray does not have a spiny tail as do the closely related devil rays (Mobula spp.).The color of the dorsal side is dark black to midnight blue with scattered whitish and greyish areas on top head.The ventral surface is white, sometimes with dark spots and blotches. The markings can often be used to recognise individual fish.Manta alfredi is similar in appearance to Manta birostris and the two species may be confused as their distribution overlaps. However, there are distinguishing features.|$|E
40|$|Assessing the trophic {{role and}} {{interaction}} {{of an animal}} is key to understanding its general ecology and dynamics. Conventional techniques used to elucidate diet, such as stomach content analysis, are not suitable for large threatened marine species. Non-lethal sampling combined with biochemical methods provides a practical alternative for investigating the feeding ecology of these species. Stable isotope and signature fatty acid analyses of muscle tissue {{were used for the}} first time to examine assimilated diet of the <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> Manta alfredi, and were compared with different zooplankton functional groups (i. e. near-surface zooplankton collected during manta ray feeding events and non-feeding periods, epipelagic zooplankton, demersal zooplankton and several different zooplankton taxa). Stable isotope δ 15 N values confirmed that the <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> is a secondary consumer. This species had relatively high levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) indicating a flagellate-based food source in the diet, which likely reflects feeding on DHA-rich near-surface and epipelagic zooplankton. However, high levels of ω 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and slightly enriched δ 13 C values in <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> tissue suggest that they do not feed solely on pelagic zooplankton, but rather obtain part of their diet from another origin. The closest match was with demersal zooplankton, suggesting it is an important component of the <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> diet. The ability to feed on demersal zooplankton is likely linked to the horizontal and vertical movement patterns of this giant planktivore. These new insights into the habitat use and feeding ecology of the <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> will assist in the effective evaluation of its conservation needs. 15 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Sightings of planktivorous {{elasmobranchs}} {{at their}} coastal aggregation sites are often linked to biological, environmental and temporal variables.

These predictors best fitted <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> sightings, a coastal species with high residency, but less so for the wider-ranging giant manta rays and whale sharks. We found a significant decline in the standardised sightings time series for the <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> (88 %) and whale shark (79 %), but not for the giant manta ray...|$|E

40|$|Background The {{trade in}} manta ray gill plates has {{considerably}} {{increased over the}} last two decades. The resulting increases in ray mortality, in addition to mortality caused by by-catch, has caused many ray populations to decrease in size. The aim {{of this study was to}} ascertain how yearling and juvenile growth and survival, and adult survival and reproduction affect <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> (Manta alfredi) population change, to increase our understanding of manta ray demography and thereby improve conservation research and measures for these fish. Methods We developed a population projection model for reef manta rays, and used published life history data on yearling and juvenile growth and adult reproduction to parameterise the model. Because little is known about <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> yearling and juvenile survival, we conducted our analyses using a range of plausible survival rate values for yearlings, juveniles and adults. Results The model accurately captured observed variation in population growth rate, lifetime reproductive success and cohort generation time in different <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> populations. Our demographic analyses revealed a range of population consequences in response to variation in demographic rates. For example, an increase in yearling or adult survival rates always elicited greater responses in population growth rate, lifetime reproductive success and cohort generation time than the same increase in juvenile survival rate. The population growth rate increased linearly, but lifetime reproductive success and cohort generation time increased at an accelerating rate with increasing yearling or adult survival rates. Hence, even a small increase in survival rate could increase lifetime reproductive success by one pup, and cohort generation time by several years. Elasticity analyses revealed that, depending on survival rate values of all life stages, the population growth rate is either most sensitive to changes in the rate with which juveniles survive but stay juveniles (i. e., do not mature into adults) or to changes in adult survival rate. However, when assessing these results against estimates on population growth and adult survival rates for populations off the coasts of Mozambique and Japan, we found that the population growth rate is predicted to be always most sensitive to changes in the adult survival rate. Discussion It is important to gain an in-depth understanding of <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> life histories, particularly of yearling and adult survival rates, as these can influence <b>reef</b> <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> population dynamics in a variety of ways. For declining populations in particular, it is crucial to know which life stage should be targeted for their conservation. For one such declining population off the coast of Mozambique, adult annual survival rate has the greatest effect on population growth, and by increasing adult survival by protecting adult aggregation sites, this population’s decline could be halted or even reversed...|$|E

40|$|As <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> face {{increased}} {{threats from}} targeted and bycatch fisheries, <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> watching tourism, if managed properly, may present an attractive economic alternative to consumptive {{use of these}} species. Both species in the genus Manta (Manta alfredi and Manta birostris) are classified by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List as species Vulnerable to extinction in the wild, and are considered unsustainable as fisheries resources due to their conservative life history characteristics, which considerably reduce their ability to recover population numbers when depleted. Utilising dive operator surveys, Internet research, and a literature review, this study provides the first global estimate of the direct economic impact of <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> watching tourism and examines the potential socio-economic benefits of non-consumptive <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> watching operations relative to consumptive use of <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> as a fishery resource. In the 23 countries in which <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> watching operations meeting our criteria were identified, we estimated direct revenue to dive operators from <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> dives and snorkels at over US$ 73 million annually and direct economic impact, including associated tourism expenditures, of US$ 140 million annually. Ten countries account for almost 93 % of the global revenue estimate, specifically Japan, Indonesia, the Maldives, Mozambique, Thailand, Australia, Mexico, United States, Federated States of Micronesia and Palau. In many of the areas where directed fisheries for <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> are known to occur, these activities overlap with <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> tourism sites or the migratory range of the mantas on which these sites depend, {{and are likely to}} be unsustainable and detrimental to <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> watching tourism...|$|R
