5|$|In 1998, a {{rotavirus}} vaccine was licensed {{for use in}} the United States. Clinical {{trials in}} the United States, Finland, and Venezuela had found it to be 80 to 100% effective at preventing severe diarrhoea caused by rotavirus A, and researchers had detected no statistically significant serious adverse effects. The manufacturer, however, withdrew it from the market in 1999, after it was discovered that the vaccine may have contributed to an increased risk for intussusception, a type of bowel obstruction, in one of every 12,000 vaccinated infants. The experience provoked intense debate about the relative <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> a rotavirus vaccine.|$|E
25|$|In the US, this {{doctrine}} places a legal obligation on {{a doctor to}} make a patient aware {{of the reason for}} treatment, the <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> a proposed treatment, the <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> alternative treatment, and the <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> receiving no treatment. The patient is then given the opportunity to accept or reject the treatment. The form states how many treatments are recommended and also makes the patient aware that consent may be revoked and treatment discontinued at any time during a course of ECT. The US Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health states that patients should be warned that the benefits of ECT are short-lived without active continuation treatment in the form of drugs or further ECT, and that there may be some risk of permanent, severe memory loss after ECT. The report advises psychiatrists to involve patients in discussion, possibly with the aid of leaflets or videos, both before and during a course of ECT.|$|E

25|$|Custom-compounded BHRT is a {{practice}} almost wholly {{restricted to the}} United States. BHRT {{is a form of}} alternative medicine, and has been promoted as a panacea for many diseases {{in addition to being a}} means of relieving the symptoms of menopause and/or reducing the risk of osteoporosis (historically, the goals of hormone replacement therapy in allopathic medicine). There is little evidence to support many of these claims; the hormones are expected to have the same <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> comparable approved drugs for which there is an evidence base and extensive research and regulation. The exception is progesterone, which may have an improved safety profile than artificial progestogens, though direct comparisons with progestins have not been made. Risks associated with the process of compounding bioidentical hormones are not clearly understood. In addition, the accuracy and efficacy of saliva testing has not been definitively proven, and the long-term effects of using blood testing to reach target levels of hormones have not been researched.|$|E

2500|$|Clinical {{practice}} {{guidelines for}} prostate cancer screening vary and are controversial due to uncertainty {{as to whether the}} benefits of screening ultimately outweigh the risks of overdiagnosis and over treatment. [...] In the United States, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the PSA test for annual screening of prostate cancer in men of age 50 and older. The patient needs to be informed of the <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> PSA testing prior to performing the test (see below). PSA levels between 4 and 10ng/mL (nanograms per milliliter) are considered to be suspicious and consideration should be given to confirming the abnormal PSA with a repeat test. If indicated, prostate biopsy is performed to obtain tissue sample for histopathological analysis. [...] In the United Kingdom, the National Health Service (2005) does not mandate, nor advise for PSA test, but allows patients to decide based on their doctor's advice.|$|E
