40|$|Latino college {{students}} (M age = 21. 4 years) completed self-report surveys assessing adolescent dating experiences. Compared to young men (n = 69), young women (n = 97) had more limitations placed {{on them by}} parents as adolescents and began dating later. No gender difference in timing of the first serious relationship emerged. More young women had their first relationship with a Latino, and having a Latino boyfriend was associated with older partner age. In multivariate analyses, parental level of education was a stronger correlate <b>of</b> <b>early</b> <b>dating</b> experiences than generational status, and stronger findings emerged for young women than young men. The findings highlight the salience of gender as an organizer <b>of</b> <b>early</b> <b>dating</b> experiences among Latino adolescents...|$|R
