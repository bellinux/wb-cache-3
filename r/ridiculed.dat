40|$|<b>Ridicule</b> {{can be used}} {{in order}} to create {{concurrence}} as well as to en-hance antagonism. This paper deals with <b>ridicule</b> that is used by a critic when he is responding to a standpoint or to a reason advanced in support of a standpoint. <b>Ridicule</b> profits from humor’s good reputation, and correctly so, even when it is used in argumentative contexts. However, <b>ridicule</b> can be harmful to a discussion. This paper will deal with <b>ridicule</b> from the perspective of strategic maneuvering between the individual rhetorical objective of effecting persuasion and the shared dialectical objective of resolving the dispute on its merits. In what ways can <b>ridicule</b> be used in strategic maneuvering and under what conditions are these uses dialectically sound...|$|R

Danny takes Angel home and the two binge-watch action movies. That evening, an unseen figure causes a gas explosion that destroys Merchant's mansion, killing him. The incident is deemed an accident and Angel is <b>ridiculed</b> for believing otherwise.|$|E
5|$|During the Enlightenment, {{intellectual}} {{sympathy for}} astrology fell away, {{leaving only a}} popular following supported by cheap almanacs. One English almanac compiler, Richard Saunders, followed {{the spirit of the}} age by printing a derisive Discourse on the Invalidity of Astrology, while in France Pierre Bayle's Dictionnaire of 1697 stated that the subject was puerile. The Anglo-Irish satirist Jonathan Swift <b>ridiculed</b> the Whig political astrologer John Partridge.|$|E
5|$|In 1829 a Mastiff like dog {{was brought}} from the Great St Bernard Hospice and was {{exhibited}} in London and Liverpool to thousands of people. This publicised {{the existence of an}} Alpine Mastiff, but drawings of the dog did not match descriptions of the Alpine Spaniel from before the exhibition, and the descriptions of the Spaniel were <b>ridiculed</b> by later publications.|$|E
40|$|<b>Ridicule</b> is a {{means of}} {{affecting}} change. Issuing an interpretation of a subject's relation to an ideological formation or social norm as an argument to change behavior, language-use, belief, or the like, <b>ridicule</b> can be used both to affirm and to contest prevailing hierarchies. As a discursive function, this dissertation theorizes, <b>ridicule</b> can be either monological or dialogical. Monological <b>ridicule</b> often {{takes the form of a}} demand or directive and usually commands its subject to comply with some ideological formation or social norm. Used in this way, it is a norming tool. In contrast, dialogical <b>ridicule</b> generally invites or encourages negotiation or mediation. As such, it is often used to contest or challenge prevailing hierarchies, with the ultimate aim of creating conditions that can allow for transformation. In six chapters, this dissertation offers a theory of <b>ridicule,</b> traces conceptions of it through western history, examines both monological and dialogical applications of it, and, lastly, explores its use on the Internet, where it has flourished. If the aim of rhetoric is to please, to instruct, or to entertain, then <b>ridicule</b> may be the master rhetorical trope as it can achieve all three simultaneously...|$|R

5|$|The {{government}} {{in exile in}} London, unrecognized {{since the end of}} World War II, <b>ridiculed</b> by the communists, to many Poles was of great symbolic importance.

5|$|The two men {{credited}} {{with the birth of}} forecasting as a science were officer of the Royal Navy Francis Beaufort and his protégé Robert FitzRoy. Both were influential men in British naval and governmental circles, and though <b>ridiculed</b> in the press at the time, their work gained scientific credence, was accepted by the Royal Navy, and formed the basis for all of today's weather forecasting knowledge.|$|E

Secretary general of the Organising Committee Lalit Bhanot countered the complaints of poor sanitation when he claimed that cultural differences accounted for differing standards of cleanliness in India and the western world. He was subsequently <b>ridiculed</b> by both the Indian and international media.|$|E
5|$|Although Haynes was a prohibitionist, he was {{a critic}} of the Indiana Branch of the Ku Klux Klan, which was in the height of its power during the 1910s and 1920s. In letters to friends and fellow prohibitionists, he <b>ridiculed</b> the {{organization}} for using violent and illegal tactics to achieve prohibition, and accused them of hypocrisy for supporting many anti-prohibition Democratic politicians. Kokomo politics was dominated by the Klan during that period and it is unknown if Haynes spoke publicly against the organization.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Ryan Tillman (August 11, 1847– July 3, 1918) was a {{politician}} of the Democratic Party {{who served as}} Governor of South Carolina from 1890 to 1894, and a United States Senator from 1895 {{until his death in}} 1918. A white supremacist who opposed civil rights for blacks, Tillman led a paramilitary group of Red Shirts during South Carolina's violent 1876 election. On the floor of the U.S. Senate, he frequently <b>ridiculed</b> blacks, and boasted of having helped to kill them during that campaign.|$|E

40|$|Modern {{society has}} placed a high premium on good health, a lean body, and comeliness. As a nation we eat better, {{exercise}} more, and seek a healthier lifestyle to achieve physical well being. A national consensus seems to exist that a well-proportioned {{body is a}} thing of beauty. It is no wonder, therefore, that obesity, a caricature of the beautiful body, has been responsible for <b>ridicule</b> and social ostracism. Not only have obese persons been subject to <b>ridicule,</b> but that <b>ridicule</b> has been socially acceptable. Witness the many cartoons, movies, plays, and books where an overweight person has been made the object of mockery, often without any gesture of sympathy to counterbalance the prejudice. <b>Ridicule</b> of another human being for being obese, or for any other reason, is insensitive and unjustified. Concern about obesity shoul...|$|R
5|$|Foliot {{was mainly}} {{a force for}} {{moderation}} in the quarrel between the king and the archbishop, urging restraint on Becket and curbing the king's attempts to impose the Constitutions more rigorously. Foliot's rhetoric against the archbishop was pointed and effective. Foliot also developed the novel legal filing of ad cautelam, which was {{an appeal to the}} papacy against any future action by the archbishop. Although Foliot's tactic of ad cautelam was <b>ridiculed</b> by his opponents, the papacy did not challenge the technique.|$|E
5|$|George was <b>ridiculed</b> by his British subjects; {{some of his}} contemporaries, such as Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, {{thought him}} unintelligent {{on the grounds that}} he was wooden in public. Though he was unpopular in Great Britain due to his {{supposed}} inability to speak English, such an inability may not have existed later in his reign as documents from that time show that he understood, spoke and wrote English. He certainly spoke fluent German and French, good Latin, and some Italian and Dutch. His treatment of his wife, Sophia Dorothea, became something of a scandal.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the social}} circumstances, {{politically}} oriented social problem films <b>ridiculed</b> politicians and portrayed them as incompetent bumblers, scoundrels, and liars. In The Dark Horse (1932), Warren William is again enlisted, {{this time to}} get an imbecile, who is accidentally in the running for Governor, elected. The candidate wins the election despite his incessant, embarrassing mishaps. Washington Merry-Go-Round portrayed the state of a political system stuck in neutral. Columbia Pictures nearly released the film with a scene of the public execution of a politician as the climax before deciding to cut it.|$|E

5|$|Having {{dealt with}} the {{pressure}} from the Magyars and the Byzantines, Simeon was free to plan a campaign against the Magyars looking for retribution. He negotiated a joint force with the Magyars' eastern neighbours, the Pechenegs, and imprisoned the Byzantine envoy Leo Choirosphaktes in order to delay {{the release of the}} captives until after the campaign against the Magyars. This would allow him to renegotiate the peace conditions in his favour. In an exchange of letters with the envoy, Simeon refused to release the captives and <b>ridiculed</b> Leo VI's astrological abilities.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, {{he became}} {{involved}} in a controversy known as the Business Plot, when he told a congressional committee {{that a group of}} wealthy industrialists were planning a military coup to overthrow Franklin D. Roosevelt, with Butler selected to lead a march of veterans to become dictator, similar to other Fascist regimes at that time. The individuals involved all denied the existence of a plot and the media <b>ridiculed</b> the allegations. A final report by a special House of Representatives Committee confirmed some of Butler's testimony.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1410s several Fellows of Oriel {{took part in}} the {{disturbances}} accompanying Archbishop Arundel's attempt to stamp out Lollardy in the University; the Lollard belief that religious power and authority came through piety and not through the hierarchy of the Church particularly inflamed passions in Oxford, where its proponent, John Wycliffe, had been head of Balliol. Disregarding the Provost's authority, Oriel's Fellows fought bloody battles with other scholars, killed one of the Chancellor's servants when they attacked his house, and were prominent among the group that obstructed the Archbishop and <b>ridiculed</b> his censures.|$|E
