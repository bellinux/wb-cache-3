These features promote SDN {{as a candidate for}} enhancing network security. However, the <b>research</b> <b>done</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> using SDN for network security reflects some limitations such as tightly-coupled application development, usage of a single SDN controller, no decoupling of networking monitoring and control functions. To address these limitations, OrchSec, an architecture for utilizing network monitoring and SDN control functions to enhance network security was proposed. In this demonstration, we aim to show how the applications developed on-top of the OrchSec architecture can be used for detecting and mitigating attacks such as ARP spoofing / cache pois oning, Denial of Service (DoS), and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), Domain Name System (DNS) amplification attacks, and Port Scanning behavior...|$|E
40|$|Drug target {{identification}} is of significant commercial interest to pharmaceutical companies, {{and there is}} a vast amount of <b>research</b> <b>done</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the topic of therapeutic target identification. Interdisciplinary research in this area involves both the biological network community and the graph algorithms community. Key steps of a typical therapeutic target identification problem include synthesizing or inferring the complex network of interactions relevant to the disease, connecting this network to the disease-specific behavior, and predicting which components are key mediators of the behavior. All of these steps involve graph theoretical or graph algorithmic aspects. In this perspective, we provide modelling and algorithmic perspectives for therapeutic target identification and highlight a number of algorithmic advances, which have gotten relatively little attention so far, with the hope of strengthening the ties between these two research communities...|$|E

30|$|This paper {{makes the}} {{following}} contributions: First, we identify {{an interesting and}} important input method for instant messaging on mobile devices: an intuitive and emotion-embedded handwriting input framework. Second, {{the core of our}} method is to record and send user’s handwriting messages with vectorized strokes using Bézier curves for preservation of personal and emotional handwriting features with compact networking traffic without deteriorating the convenience of instant messaging. Furthermore, we also simulate a scroll paper through a moving writing window and use the entire touch screen to ease the handwriting process and overcome fat finger issues. Finally, we embed the input framework onto a popular instant messaging system to show its easiness of implementation. As demonstrated in the results, our system is preferred while intending to deliver contents with sincerity and emotion. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the method used in this study. Section 3 reviews those previous <b>research</b> <b>done</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> this work. Section 4 describes our pre-studies to understand issues existing in current texting.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Liturgics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. λειτουργία denotes all the {{religious}} acts {{and activities of}} worship performed by Christians during the worship service and in life. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the nature of the interactive relationship between the liturgy of the worship service and the liturgy of a Scripture driven life. The central theoretical argument of the study was that this relationship is dynamic and transforming. Basic theoretical perspectives were formulated in Section A. The comprehensive conclusion attained in this section was that the liturgy of the worship service and the liturgy of life is an undividable unit consisting of differentiate elements. Meta-theoretical perspectives were formulated in Section B. These principles were drawn from <b>research</b> <b>done</b> <b>relating</b> <b>to</b> postmodernism, the effects of the post- 94 transformation in South Africa on previously advantaged South African Christians and empirical research. The perspectives indicated that the praxis of life impacted directly on the liturgy of the worship service. The conclusions reached in both Sections A and B lead to the final conclusion that the nature of the interactive relationship between the liturgy of the worship service and the liturgy of life is dynamic and transforming. It was further indicated by the research that the interactive relationship between the liturgy of the worship service and the liturgy of life reflected the broken reality of our sin-corrupted world. Hence an adjusted practical theory and accompanying practical theoretical model were developed to aid the alignment of the praxis as indicated by the meta-theoretical perspectives with the Scriptural ideal purported by the basis theoretical principles.

40|$|This {{case study}} investigates the {{perceptions}} of two small samples of learners, one at Key Stage 3 and the other at Key Stage 4, at a small, independent progressive school, of Philosophy for Children (P 4 C), or Philosophical Enquiry (PE), lessons in the academic year 2011 / 12. The research interest lay in learners’ motivation and therefore the principal research questions addressed whether the participants enjoyed the sessions, and whether they engaged {{with the process of}} P 4 C/PE. The answer, supported by quantitative data, was overwhelming, yes, they did. While not generalisable, the <b>research</b> <b>does</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> students’ disengagement from learning in mainstream secondary education. As background to the curriculum intervention, this dissertation discusses the pedagogy of P 4 C/PE in practice, and its foundations in the philosophy of education. This account suggests that the desired learning outcomes of P 4 C/PE are contestable within a wider context of educational policy and practice. P 4 C is known as a ‘thinking skills’ programme. Therefore, although centred in the affective domain, the remaining research questions were designed to be open to respondents’ perceptions of what they learnt and how they learnt in terms of ‘critical’ or ‘higher-order’ thinking and other transferable skills. This generated qualitative data; in contrast with much of the research into P 4 C, there was no attempt to measure cognitive development. The study is presented as an illuminative evaluation, descriptive of a multi-faceted practice in which the affective and cognitive interweave. The study discusses the facilitation and teaching approach of the researcher with regard to his professional development. It concludes that there is evidence that the P 4 C/PE sessions achieved a measure of success in its own terms, and, in terms of the curriculum policy of the school, that it can contribute to a humanistic and progressive pedagogy...|$|R

Perron Master of Science, 2013 Abstract In {{this study}} Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) {{was used to}} acquire flow field and {{velocity}} information for a bluff body flame holder and a jet in cross-flow flame holder. The bluff body trials tested consisted of combustion of a premixed air and fuel flow {{with the purpose of}} improving boundary conditions. The jet in cross-flow flame holder was tested with a variety of jet to cross-flow momentum ratios. A tutorial is given on using MATLAB programming to use the PIV data to calculate fluid properties such as velocity, vorticity, and strain rates. Velocity vector fields are used to determine the velocity at different areas of the test section and to verify boundary conditions. The uncertainty of the PIV measurement is found using a correlation map, and the resulting error to the fluid calculations is found using a central differencing scheme. Conditioned Particle Image Velocimetry (CPIV) is introduced and used to find the flame edge.
