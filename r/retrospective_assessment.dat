500|$|By his own admission, Gravel was too new and [...] "too abrasive" [...] to be {{effective}} in the Senate by the usual means of seniority-based committee assignments or negotiating deals with other senators, and was sometimes seen as arrogant by the more senior members. Gravel instead relied upon attention-getting gestures to achieve what he wanted, hoping national exposure would force other senators to listen to him. As part of this he voted with Southern Democrats to keep the Senate filibuster rule in place, and accordingly supported Russell Long and Robert Byrd but opposed Ted Kennedy in Senate leadership battles. In <b>retrospective</b> <b>assessment,</b> University of Alaska Anchorage history professor Stephen Haycox would say, [...] "Loose cannon is a good description of Gravel's Senate career.

We conducted a field study on the high speed railway track Cologne-Frankfurt/Main {{as well as a}} simulation study in our pressure chamber TITAN (DLR-Institute of Aerospace Medicine) with 31 subjects (mean age ¼ 37. 7, SD ¼ 12. 7; 51. 6 % male) to investigate pressure comfort for passengers. Continuous assessments of pressure events using sliders and <b>retrospective</b> <b>assessments</b> were acquired. Pressure variations were mostly tolerated. A comparison of field and laboratory setting revealed high congruency of continuous as well as <b>retrospective</b> <b>assessments.</b> A generalized estimating equation model identified pressure change attributes contributing to passengers’ discomfort.

40|$|The {{research}} {{used the}} Berger and Luckmann (1966) treatment of alternations [...] radical life changes [...] to examine divorce. The relationship between present adjustment of divorced persons and <b>retrospective</b> <b>assessments</b> {{of their former}} marriage was examined. It was hypothesized that divorced persons make negative assessments of their former marriage, and these assessments are related to adjustment. It further proposed that associational relationships provide support for these assessments. The model indicated that <b>retrospective</b> <b>assessments</b> are related to abandonment of the former spouse and involvement with a new intimate, which is related to adjustment;The respondents included 87 divorced persons, whose divorces were granted between January 1, 1979, and August 17, 1981, in Custer County, Oklahoma, who replied to a mailed questionnaire. Since the response rate was low (29 %), {{it was concluded that}} the respondents do not represent the population;The dependent variable, adjustment of divorced persons, was operationalized as the Bradburn Affect Balance Scale. The Marriage Assessment Scale was created to measure the extent of positive and negative assessments made regarding the former marriage;The findings indicate that divorced persons make negative assessments of their former marriage (e. g., they make negative rather than positive responses on the Marriage Assessment Scale), and that some of these are related to adjustment. Since the model was not supported by the data, an alternative model, which proposed that associational relationships are related to <b>retrospective</b> <b>assessments</b> of the former marriage and these are related to adjustment, was tested. Some support was found for this model, especially regarding the former spouse relationship. Divorced persons with low contact with the former spouse at present {{are more likely to have}} negative assessments of the past, and have better adjustment. Having a new intimate at present is highly correlated with adjustment, although negative assessments of the former marriage do not serve as intervening variables as proposed by the model. Apparently the new intimate relationship is oriented toward the here and now, and less likely to be involved with any assessment of the past. It was concluded that divorce represents a radical life change, but it lacks the supportive associational relationships which provide negative assessments of the past and consequences for adjustment;Reference;Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann. 1966.

30|$|In this context, DSM- 5 's (and ICD's) non-recognition of pure mania and {{hypomania}} as diagnostic entities remains {{problematic in}} view of the accumulating evidence. Both conditions are fairly common in adolescence (Päären et al. 2013). Moreover, the large, representative, epidemiological NCS-A study (N = 10, 123 adolescents aged 13 to 18 years) has demonstrated the frequent independence of mania and hypomania from depression (Merikangas et al. 2012). Most recently, the NIMH family study of patients with mood disorders has shown that mania is even genetically independent (Merikangas et al., in press). Adolescents, unlike adults, more often meet the DSM-IV criteria for mania and hypomania without MDD than for bipolar disorders, but they are often unaware of their mood changes, whereas adults' <b>retrospective</b> <b>assessments</b> are rich in false negatives, as Moffitt et al.

30|$|The {{challenge}} ahead lies {{in managing}} New Zealand’s exotic forests within environments where storms and landslide failures are a regular occurrence {{and where the}} failure of ‘natural’ slopes beyond the forest boundary is {{more often than not}} the greatest contributor to stream sediment load and yield. Thus the identification and avoidance of unstable terrain, especially in those forests located in areas recognised as being geologically fragile, are critical to reducing environmental, social, and economic costs incurred by slope failures that may occur at any stage throughout a forest’s rotation. Although the knowledge gained from <b>retrospective</b> <b>assessments</b> of storm-related impacts is unlikely to help prevent slope failures during future storms, lessons learned will nonetheless assist in the identification of areas elsewhere where a similar potential for slope failure associated with forest activities—not just harvesting—exists. In addition, lessons learned have value in either underpinning or re-evaluating existing best management practices and environmental standards.|$|R
40|$|American presidents, {{like all}} {{democratic}} political leaders, rely on popular support {{in order to}} promote their political agenda, gain legislative victories, and succeed at the ballot box. Extant studies of approval, however, focus resolutely on aggregate values, while individual level determinants, and variation, have been ignored. This paper redresses this imbalance, and in doing so speaks to the outstanding questions in studies of presidential approval. Individual level presidential approval is a product of three dimensions of evaluation: prospective policy judgements (what {{are you going to do}} for me tomorrow?), <b>retrospective</b> <b>assessments</b> (what did you do for me yesterday?), and personality assessments (what kind of leader are you?). In addition, the model draws on new models of uncertainty in the survey response, testing the hypothesis that weaker partisan attachments and lower levels of chronic political information will lead to greater uncertainty about presidential performance.
