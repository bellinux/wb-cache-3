40|$|AbstractAccelerometers {{are used}} in most robot {{navigation}} systems as sensors for <b>robot</b> <b>speed</b> and localization. Normally, these accelerometers sense the body acceleration, which is integrated to determine the robot velocity, and cumulatively the robot position relative to the starting position. When the robot is moving on a horizontal surface, the computed speed will in general reflect the actual robot speed; however, when the robot is moving on an inclined surface, such as uphill or downhill motions, then the measured speed will include components due to gravity, which {{are not part of}} the actual <b>robot</b> <b>speed.</b> Therefore the computed speed will not reflect the actual <b>robot</b> <b>speed.</b> These gravity components must be compensated for in the speed computations to capture the actual <b>robot</b> <b>speed.</b> This paper proposes a computational approach for elimination of the gravity components from the accelerometer measurements using a 3 -axis accelerometers combined with 3 -axis gyro on tilted surfaces. The compensated accelerometer speed results were compared to simulated <b>robot</b> <b>speed</b> results on inclined surfaces, and were found to accurately reflect the actual <b>robot</b> <b>speed.</b> By using these compensated accelerometer results it becomes possible to determine the <b>robot</b> <b>speed</b> even under wheel slip conditions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Distributed {{algorithms}} {{running on}} multi-robot systems rely on ad-hoc networks to relay messages throughout the group. The propagation speed of these messages is large, but not infinite, and problems in algorithm execution can arise when the <b>robot</b> <b>speed</b> {{is a large}} fraction of the message propagation speed. This implies a robot “speed limit”, as any robot moving away from a message source faster than the message speed will never receive new information, and no algorithm can function properly on it. In this work, we focus on measuring the accuracy of multi-robot distributed algorithms. We define the <b>Robot</b> <b>Speed</b> Ratio (RSR) as the ratio of <b>robot</b> <b>speed</b> to message speed. We express it {{in a form that}} is platform-independent and captures the relationship between communications usage, robot mobility, and algorithm accuracy, allowing for trade-offs between these quantities at design time. Finally, we present results from experiments with 30 robots that characterize the accuracy of preexisting distributed algorithms. In all cases, accuracy degrades as the RSR increases. 1 Introduction and Related Wor...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method of}} controlling the <b>robot</b> <b>speed</b> using a probabilistic occupancy map. It is usually necessary for a robot {{to make sure that}} a target region is free before entering there. If the robot is not confident the state (free or occupied) of the region, the robot has to make enough observations to be confident. If the distance to the region is long, the robot can expect to have enough observations until reaching there. If the distance is short, however, the robot may have to slow down for making enough observations. Based on this consideration, we develop a method for controlling the <b>robot</b> <b>speed</b> by considering the state of a target region.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new concept}} of a mobile <b>robot</b> <b>speed</b> control by using two degree of freedom gear transmission. The developed intelligent speed controller utilizes a gear box which comprises of epicyclic gear train with two inputs, one coupled with the engine shaft and another with the shaft of a variable speed dc motor. The net output speed {{is a combination of}} the two input speeds and is governed by the transmission ratio of the planetary gear train. This new approach eliminates the use of a torque converter which is otherwise an indispensable part of all available automatic transmissions, thereby reducing the power loss that occurs in the box during the fluid coupling. By gradually varying the speed of the dc motor a stepless transmission has been achieved. The other advantages of the developed controller are pulling over and reversing the vehicle, implemented by intelligent mixing of the dc motor and engine speeds. This approach eliminates traditional braking system in entire vehicle design. The use of two power sources, IC engine and battery driven DC motor, utilizes the modern idea of hybrid vehicles. The new mobile <b>robot</b> <b>speed</b> controller is capable of driving the vehicle even in extreme case of IC engine failure, for example, due to gas depletion. ...|$|E

However, due to the complex wheel-ground interactions and the kinematic constraints, {{it is a challenge}} to understand the kinematics and dynamics of such a robotic platform. In this paper, we develop an analysis and experimental kinematic scheme for a skid-steering wheeled vehicle based-on a laser scanner sensor. The kinematics model is established based on the boundedness of the instantaneous centers of rotation (ICR) of treads on the 2 D motion plane. The kinematic parameters (the ICR coefficient, the path curvature variable  and <b>robot</b> <b>speed),</b> including the effect of vehicle dynamics, are introduced to describe the kinematics model.

40|$|Legged {{locomotion}} on flowing ground (e. g. granular media) {{is unlike}} locomotion on hard ground because feet experience both solid- and fluid-like forces during surface penetration. Recent bio-inspired legged robots display speed relative to body size on hard ground comparable to high performing organisms like cockroaches but suffer significant performance loss on flowing materials like sand. In laboratory experiments we study the performance (speed) {{of a small}} (2. 3 kg) six-legged robot, SandBot, as it runs {{on a bed of}} granular media (1 mm poppy seeds). For an alternating tripod gait on the granular bed, standard gait control parameters achieve speeds at best two orders of magnitude smaller than the 2 body lengths/s (≈ 60 cm/s) for motion on hard ground. However, empirical adjustment of these control parameters away from the hard ground settings, restores good performance, yielding top speeds of 30 cm/s. <b>Robot</b> <b>speed</b> depends sensitively on the packing fraction ϕ and the limb frequency ω, and a dramatic transition from rotary walking to slow swimming occurs when ϕ becomes small enough and/or ω large enough.
