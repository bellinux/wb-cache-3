Areas of New England are not areas normally inhabited by F. magna, but the fluke has been <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> region. In Canada, the fluke {{was reported}} in Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec. Currently, F. magna is enzootic in five major areas: (1) the Great Lakes region; (2) the Gulf coast, lower Mississippi, and southern Atlantic seaboard; (3) northern Pacific coast; (4) the Rocky Mountain trench; and (5) northern Quebec and Labrador. However, within these broad ranges, actual presence of giant liver flukes varies from locally abundant to locally absent.|$|E
25|$|The name Artúr is {{frequently}} attested in southern Scotland and northern England in the 7th and 8th centuries. For example, Artúr mac Conaing, {{who may have}} been named after his uncle Artúr mac Áedáin. Artúr son of Bicoir Britone was another <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period, who slew Mongán mac Fiachnai of Ulster in 620/625 in Kintyre. A man named Feradach, apparently the grandson of one Artuir, was a signatory at the synod that enacted the Law of Adomnan in 697. Arthur ap Pedr was a prince in Dyfed, born around 570–580. Given the popularity of this name at the time, it is likely that others were named for a figure who was already established in regional history or folklore by that time.|$|E

The polling officials were forced to trek through deep snow to reach the polling stations and polls took place 2days later on 15 May in these two stations.
