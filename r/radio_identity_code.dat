40|$|The face {{perception}} system {{is comprised of}} a network of connected regions including the middle fusiform gyrus (“fusiform face area” or FFA), the inferior occipital gyrus (“occipital face area” or OFA), and the posterior part of the superior temporal sulcus. These regions are typically active bilaterally but may show right hemisphere dominance. The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) response of the right FFA is normally attenuated for face stimuli of the same compared to different identities, called fMR-adaptation. The recovery in fMRI signal, or release from fMR-adaptation, for faces of different identities indicates that the neural population comprising the FFA is involved in <b>coding</b> face <b>identity.</b> Patients with prosopagnosia who are unable to visually recognize faces and who show right OFA damage, nonetheless show face-selective activation in the right FFA (Rossion et al., 2003; Steeves et al., 2006). However, the sensitivity to face identity is abnormal in the right FFA and does not show the typical release from adaptation for different face identities (Steeves et al., 2009). This indicates that in these patients the FFA is not differentiating face identity and suggests that an intact right OFA is integral for face <b>identity</b> <b>coding.</b> We used offline repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to temporarily disrupt processing in the right OFA in healthy subjects. We then immediately performed fMRI to measure changes in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal across the face network using a face fMR-adaptation paradigm. We hypothesized that TMS to the right OFA would induce abnormal face <b>identity</b> <b>coding</b> in the right FFA, reflected by a decreased adaptation response. Indeed, activation for different but not same identity faces in the right FFA decreased after TMS was applied to the right OFA compared to sham TMS and TMS to a control site, the nearby object-selective right lateral occipital area (LO). Our findings indicate that TMS to the OFA selectively disrupts face but not butterfly <b>identity</b> <b>coding</b> in both the OFA and FFA. Congruent with mounting evidence from both patients and healthy subjects, here we causally demonstrate the importance of the often-overlooked OFA for normal face <b>identity</b> <b>coding</b> in the FFA...|$|R

40|$|When {{and where}} will a new {{organizational}} form emerge? Recent theory {{says that as}} the number of organizations using a particular external <b>identity</b> <b>code</b> first increases beyond a critical minimal level, the code becomes an organizational form. But how is an external <b>identity</b> <b>code</b> established? We assume that the <b>identity</b> <b>code</b> derives from the aggregated identities of individual organizations. Our core argument holds that when the identities of individual organizations are perceptually focused, they will more readily cohere into a distinct collective identity. We develop ideas about how two observable aspects of organizations might generate perceptually focused identities in a common market: (1) de novo entry and (2) agglomeration in a geographic place with a related identity. Using comprehensive data from the market for disk drive arrays, we analyze these ideas and an alternative by estimating effects of different specifications of organizational and product densities on rates of entry and exit for array producers. The findings show that the density of de novo firms affects all (de alio as well as de novo) disk array producers in form-establishing ways: de novo density significantly increases all firm entry and significantly reduces all firm exit. Analyzing densities of certain geographic areas, we also find evidence of faster form development in a place with a related identity and a geographic agglomeration of disk array producers. Finally, we find that joint operation of the two processes, geographic agglomeration of de novo producers in a place with a related identity, serves to enhance form emergence even faster. Overall, the analysis supports the notion that firms with perceptually focused identities aid in establishing an organizational form. It does not show empirical support for a common sense alternative interpretation based on product proliferation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a controlling and positioning approach for an optical filter disk. In the known applications where Hall-effect sensors and magnets (radially positioned) are applied, {{the purpose of}} the latter is to help developing a binary code used mainly for filter identification. The number of sensors is equal to the maximum number of magnets that participate in forming the filter <b>identity</b> <b>code.</b> Therefore, three sensors and the corresponding number of magnets radially positioned for each position are required for the identification of seven filters. The precise position of the filter disk is reached by counting up the steps of a stepper motor. The presented approach applies only one Hall-effect sensor. The fore working front of one magnet, positioned along the disk periphery, is used to precisely mark each filter position. At a certain distance after the main magnet, a second one is positioned in order to form an <b>identity</b> <b>code.</b> The paper contains an algorithm for optical filter disk control and positioning, along with the mathematical formalism on which it is based.
