Despite this, key facets of driver behaviour at <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings,</b> such as situation awareness and decision making, remain ambiguous. This is largely {{down to the}} inability of existing methodologies to describe or evaluate the cognitive aspects of driver behaviour when negotiating <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings.</b> This paper showcases an on-road approach for examining driver situation awareness at <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings.</b> The study presented involved participants, classified either as novice or experienced drivers, providing concurrent verbal protocols as they drove a pre-determined urban route incorporating four <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings.</b> Driver situation awareness was modelled using a network analysis-based approach and the structure {{and content of the}} networks was assessed. The analysis revealed key differences between novice and experienced drivers situation awareness at <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings.</b> In closing, the benefits of the on-road approach are discussed and a series of wider driver behaviour applications are proposed...|$|R
40|$|Crashes at <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> {{represent}} a significant problem, both in Australia and worldwide. Advances in driving assessment methods, {{such as the}} provision of on-road instrumented test vehicles, now provide researchers {{with the opportunity to}} further understand driver behaviour at <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> in ways not previously possible. This paper gives an overview of a recent onroad pilot study of driver behaviour at <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> in which 25 participants drove a predetermined route, incorporating 4 <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings,</b> using MUARC’s instrumented On-Road Test Vehicle (ORTeV). Drivers provided verbal commentary whilst driving the route, and a range of other data were collected, including eye fixations, forward, cockpit and driver video, and vehicle data (speed, braking, steering wheel angle, lane tracking etc). Participants also completed a post trial cognitive task analysis interview. Extracts from the wider analyses are used to examine in depth driver behaviour at one of the <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> encountered during the study. The analysis presented gives insight into the driver and wider systems factors that shape behaviour at <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings,</b> and highlights the utility of using a multi-method, instrumented vehicle approach for gathering data regarding driver behaviour in different contexts...|$|R

This paper describes an on-road study comparing novice and experienced driver situation awareness at rural <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings.</b> Participants provided verbal protocols while driving a pre-determined rural route incorporating ten <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings.</b> Driver situation awareness {{was assessed using}} a network analysis approach. The analysis revealed key differences between novice and experienced drivers' situation awareness. In particular, the novice drivers {{seemed to be more}} reliant on <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> crossing warnings and their situation awareness was less focussed on the environment outside of the <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> crossing.

40|$|The sociotechnical systems {{approach}} argues that systems with adaptive capacity will be safer. However, this approach may conflict with current practice in safety management. We applied cognitive work analysis {{to understand the}} problem of pedestrian safety at <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> and used the findings to evaluate the current design against the values of sociotechnical systems theory. The evaluation was conducted against indicators developed based on the sociotechnical literature and it is concluded that the existing design of <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> does not align with the values.

40|$|<b>Rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> {{in urban}} areas are often located in areas of high visual clutter such as busy {{shopping}} strip areas. The impact of such visual clutter on drivers’ behavior and compliance with level crossing controls is not well understood. This study examines drivers’ visual scanning behavior on approach to five urban <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> located in shopping strips. Twenty participants drove an instrumented vehicle around a pre-defined urban route containing a range of active (flashing light with boom barriers) <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings.</b> Drivers' eye glance and head check behavior during the 150 meter approach to each crossing was coded from video. Results revealed that drivers direct their visual attention off the forward roadway {{to a range of}} areas inside and outside the vehicle when approaching the crossing, with around 10 percent of glance fixations made to areas away from the forward roadway and the level crossing. Drivers made very few head checks of the crossing on approach, suggesting that they are heavily reliant on the crossing signals to alert them to the presence of a train. This study provides important insight into drivers’ visual behavior on approach to urban <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> located in areas of high visual demand...|$|R
40|$|The long-standing {{worldwide}} {{issue of}} <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> crossing collisions needs little introduction in these circles. In Australia (where {{this research is}} being undertaken), between 2000 and 2009 there were almost 700 collisions between road vehicles and trains at <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings,</b> resulting in 97 fatalities (Independent Transport Safety Regulator, 2011). Despite various initiatives, in 2011 there were 49 collisions between trains and <b>road</b> vehicles at <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> crossing in Australia, leading to 33 fatalities (ATSB, 2012). The problem is not only limited to collisions between trains and vehicles; off the road there were 92 collisions between trains and pedestrians at RLXs between 2002 and 2012 (Australian Transport Safety Bureau, 2012). The issue represents a ‘systems’ problem in that all users of <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> have some risk {{of being involved in}} a collision. The continued incidence of trauma at <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> is unacceptable, and provides clear evidence that the current approach to <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> crossing safety is failing. In recent times researchers have suggested that {{this may be due to}} the fact that there is a general lack of understanding of behaviour at <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> (Edquist et al, 2009) and also because a systems thinking approach has not been adopted when attempting to improve <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> crossing designs (e. g. Read et al, 2013; Salmon et al, 2013). In the case of the latter, it is argued that a focus on components in isolation (such as road users, or warnings) has led to incremental design changes that can have only marginal effects. This ‘fix the broken component’ mentality has previously come under criticism and is generally accepted to be a limited approach to safety management (e. g. Dekker, 2011); however, despite repeated calls, a systems thinking approach to <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> crossing safety has yet to materialise. The research described in this paper is a direct response to this. The paper presents an overview of a <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> crossing design lifecycle process that involved applying a systems analysis and design framework, Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA; Vicente, 1999) first to analyse existing <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> crossing systems, and then to generate, evaluate, and refine new <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> crossing design concepts designed to improve safety. The process was adopted as part of a major research program currently being undertaken in Victoria, Australia. The aim is to propose new and evaluate new safer <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> crossing system designs. The paper will provide an overview of the overall process adopted and will present and discuss selected outputs from each of the following phases: systems analysis and problem identification; generation of design concepts, evaluation of design concepts, and refinement of design concepts. In closing, the implications for future <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> crossing design activities will be discussed, along with the benefits of using CWA In this manner...|$|R
40|$|AbstractProgress is {{not being}} made on the longstanding problem of {{collisions}} between people and trains at <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings.</b> It {{has been suggested that}} this may be, in part, {{due to a lack of}} systems thinking during design, crash analysis, and countermeasure development. This paper presents a systems analysis of current <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> crossing systems in Australia that was undertaken specifically to identify safety-related issues in <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> crossing environments. Cognitive work analysis was used to analyze current <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> crossing systems based on data derived from a range of focused data collection activities. The analysis identified various issues potentially impacting behavior and safety across the different users of <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings.</b> In addition, potential areas for improvement through redesign were highlighted. An important implication of the study is that improvements in behavior and safety may be achievable through changes to the overall <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> crossing system (e. g. values, goals, norms, data systems) as opposed to changes to the physical <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> crossing infrastructure only. The implications for future <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> crossing design activities are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Improving {{safety at}} <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> is an {{important}} part of both <b>road</b> and <b>rail</b> safety strategies. While low in number, crashes between vehicles and trains at <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> are catastrophic events typically involving multiple fatalities and serious injuries. Advances in driving assessment methods, such as the provision of on-road instrumented test vehicles with eye and head tracking, provide researchers with the opportunity to further understand driver behaviour at such crossings in ways not previously possible. This paper describes a study conducted to further understand the factors that shape driver behaviour at <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> using instrumented vehicles. Twenty-two participants drove an On-Road Test Vehicle (ORTeV) on a predefined route in regional Victoria with a mix of both active (flashing lights with/without boom barriers) and passively controlled (stop, give way) crossings. Data collected included driving performance data, head checks, and interview data to capture driver strategies. The data from an integrated suite of methods demonstrated clearly how behaviour differs at active and passive <b>level</b> <b>crossings,</b> particularly for inexperienced drivers. For example, the head check data clearly show the reliance and expectancies of inexperienced drivers for active warnings even when approaching passively controlled crossings. These studies provide very novel and unique insights into how level crossing design and warnings shape driver behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Forecasting {{accidents}} {{before they}} occur {{is the final}} frontier for safety science. Although this has long been recognized, the discipline of human factors has yet to produce an appropriate methodology for achieving this. This paper presents some of the findings from an exploratory study in which the abstraction hierarchy method from the work domain analysis phase of cognitive work {{analysis was used to}} predict potential accidents. Using <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> as a test case, the exploratory study revealed that the abstraction hierarchy method was able to predict a range of failure pathways that could potentially lead to a collision between a road user and a train at <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings.</b> In addition, certain features of the abstraction hierarchy method were found to make it highly consistent with contemporary systems level views on accident causation, including that it provides a systems level analysis of potential accident pathways, that is does not support a focus on broken human components (since the abstraction hierarchy model is actor independent), and that the primary focus is on the relationships between components rather than the components themselves. Further testing of the approach is recommended, including sensitivity and validity testing whereby the predictions made are compared to real world events...|$|R
40|$|Collisions at <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> (RLXs) are {{typically}} high-severity and high-cost, often involving serious injuries, fatalities and major disruptions to the transport network. Most research examining behaviour at RLXs has focused exclusively on drivers and consequently {{there is little}} knowledge on how other road users make decisions at RLXs. We collected drivers’, motorcyclists’, bicyclists’ and pedestrians’ self-reported daily experiences at RLXs for two weeks, focusing on behaviour, decision-making and information use {{in the presence of}} a train and/or activated RLX signals. Both information use and behaviour differed between road users. Visual information (e. g., flashing lights) was more influential for motorists, whereas pedestrians and cyclists relied more on auditory information (e. g., bells). Pedestrians were also more likely to violate active RLX warnings and/or cross before an approaching train. These results emphasise the importance of adopting holistic RLX design approaches that support cognition and behaviour across for all road users. Practitioner summary: This study explores how information use and decision-making at <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> (RLXs) differs between road user groups, using a two-week self-report study. Most users make safe decisions, but pedestrians are most likely to violate RLX warnings. Information use (visual vs. auditory) also differs substantially between road user groups...|$|R
40|$|Safe system {{strategies}} {{govern the}} approaches to road safety in many countries. This {{is the case}} for both <b>road</b> and <b>rail</b> safety in Australia. In this paper we take a complex segment of the <b>road</b> and <b>rail</b> system, <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings,</b> to demonstrate why the current approaches to safety in this area need to change. We argue that approaches that are more consistent with real systems thinking are required to generate the new interventions needed to reduce road trauma in this setting. In recognizing the need for new approaches the Victorian <b>road</b> and <b>rail</b> sponsors have partnered with Australian and UK Universities in an exciting four year initiative designed to change the paradigm in RLX safety. In this paper we outline the rationale for this change and describe the four phase analytical approach being used.

40|$|Accidents at <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> (RLXs) {{represent}} an important public safety concern. Traditional approaches to RLX safety {{have focused on}} the implementation of technology such as warnings and barriers to control road user behaviour.

This will enable <b>road</b> and <b>rail</b> stakeholders to develop innovative design solutions which are appropriate for the complexity of the domain, including adaptability to future changes in a dynamic transport environment. This paper describes the use of one aspect of a systems thinking-based design toolkit to prompt design insights following the application of the cognitive work analysis framework to RLXs. The process resulted in the identification of design insights for use in a participatory design process and supported the research team to consider the principles of sociotechnical systems theory...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} {{intensity of}} operations {{means that the}} longstanding safety issue of <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> {{is likely to become}} worse in the transport systems of the future.

This paper presents a systems analysis of current active <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> crossing systems in Victoria, Australia that was undertaken to identify design requirements to improve safety in future <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> crossing environments. Cognitive work analysis was used to analyse <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> crossing systems using data derived from a range of activities. Overall the analysis identified a range of instances where modification or redesign in line with systems thinking could potentially improve behaviour and safety. A notable finding is that there are opportunities for redesign outside of the physical <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> crossing infrastructure, including improved data systems, in-vehicle warnings and modifications to design processes, standards and guidelines.

Measures of speed and braking on approach were analyzed, along with subjective measures of workload and usability. Superior driving behavior and subjective ratings were achieved for a design that incorporated an in-vehicle device while the lowest subjective ratings were given {{in relation to a}} shared space design that incorporated a simplified crossing environment and sharing of the road environment between motorized and non-motorized users.

40|$|Governments {{and road}} safety {{agencies}} {{around the world}} have either introduced or are considering 'safe system' strategies, a long overdue acknowledgement that different elements of the road system contribute to road safety outcomes. Human factors approaches have a leading role here in both conceptualising the road system as a complex sociotechnical system and in providing practical approaches to support true systems-based countermeasures. This book illustrates the potential for integrating contemporary systems-based human factors methods with modern day driving-assessment methods, such as vehicle instrumentation and driving simulation, to understand and enhance performance in modern day road-transport systems. The book outlines why a fundamental paradigm shift is needed in the way these systems are designed and operated, and illustrates how a wide range of accepted human-factors approaches can be applied successfully to road transport to revolutionise the countermeasure design process. The practical illustrations of these human factors methods are applied to a long-standing <b>road</b> and <b>rail</b> safety issue: <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings,</b> where the <b>road</b> and <b>rail</b> systems intersect.

There is little literature examining pedestrian behaviour at RLXs and no {{previous studies have}} adopted a formative approach to understanding behaviour in this context. In this article, cognitive work analysis is applied to understand the constraints that shape pedestrian behaviour at RLXs in Melbourne, Australia. The five phases of cognitive work analysis were developed using data gathered via document analysis, behavioural observation, walk-throughs and critical decision method interviews. The analysis demonstrates the complex nature of pedestrian decision making at RLXs and the findings are synthesised to provide a model illustrating the influences on pedestrian decision making in this context (i. e. time, effort and social pressures).

The current design of rail crossings incorporates assumptions and hypotheses about how people will interact with the infrastructure at the crossing.

Comparison of actual behavior as recorded in the observations was compared to the design hypotheses relating to the features at the crossing. While for some the majority of behavior was {{in line with the}} hypothesis, it was found that a number of the hypotheses were not always supported.

40|$|<b>Rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> are {{designed}} to promote safety at road–rail interfaces, but also create the opportunity for conflicts between the two modes of transport. Some of these conflicts can occur due to risk taking behaviour and decision-making errors of road users and represent a significant safety risk. Comparatively {{little is known about}} causes of risk-taking behaviour specific to remote locations or regions where the road traffic is dominated by long road vehicles with extremely heavy loads, such as mining and resources traffic. The trains operating in these areas may be up to 3. 2 km long and can take a very long time to pass through a crossing. In these circumstances, people must adapt to a very different mode of <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> crossing use than in less remote locations. The current approach to improve safety at road–rail intersections in Australia is to upgrade <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> with a full complement of active and automatic protection, including boom barriers, flashing lights, bells, and advanced warning signals. However, crashes still occur despite the active protection being operational. The Pilbara region of Western Australia {{is an example of a}} remote location with intense mining and resources traffic and, with an abundance of <b>rail</b> operations, numerous <b>level</b> <b>crossings.</b> Anecdotal evidence suggests that level crossing strikes and near misses are a particular safety concern in this region. Given the significance of the Pilbara region to Australia’s economy, problems with traffic flow may hinder opportunities for continued growth enabled by increased reliability and automation of service delivery. Determining the causes of collisions at <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> in this region is the focus of a mixed-methodological investigation, with the aim of providing potential controls that may reduce or mitigate these occurrences.

40|$|Collisions at <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> (RLXs) {{present an}} ongoing major {{challenge}} for both <b>road</b> and <b>rail</b> safety organisations. Previous research has made little systematic {{attempt to understand}} road user decision making at RLXs, with most research relying on observational studies of single road user groups only. In this exploratory study, we applied Rasmussen’s (1974) decision ladder (DL) {{for the first time}} in the RLX safety context to compare the decision making processes used during compliant and non-compliant encounters at RLXs. The data used to populate the DL was derived from a two-week diary study in which four groups of road users (drivers, motorcyclists, cyclists and pedestrians) described their encounters with actively controlled RLXs when a train was approaching. Ninety-five road users made a total of 247 crossings, 11. 7 % of which were non-compliant (n = 29). Overall, the decision making processes differed between compliant and non-compliant encounters. On non-compliant encounters road users were least concerned with safety, based their decision making on a much smaller component of the RLX system, and proceeded further along the DL (i. e., considered multiple courses of action). The results of this study may have important implications for RLX designs, but firstly should be validated using larger samples of non-compliant encounters...|$|R

40|$|<b>Level</b> <b>crossings</b> {{represent}} {{one of the}} key strategic risks on railways {{across the}} world. Recent research has indicated that collisions at <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> (RLXs) may be better prevented through more sophisticated allocation of functions within these environments. The aim of the research described here was to explore this further and to identify potential design remedies. Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA) is a systems analysis framework that has been successfully used to identify how social and technical components within systems can be configured to enhance overall performance. Two CWA techniques were used to identify design options related to how functions are allocated within RLX systems. Based on an analysis of nine RLXs in metropolitan Melbourne, the findings highlighted an uneven spread of activity across the situations in which train detection and safety can occur and across the actors involved in these functions. The majority of activity currently occurs when users are closest to the RLX. However, there are instances where important activities could occur away from the RLX but typically do not. In addition, the analysis showed that the RLX infrastructure is currently responsible for most functions relating to safety, and there are parts of the system that could be better exploited to support and/or improve behaviour, including humans, invehicle systems and the surrounding infrastructure...|$|R

This study sought to examine where drivers direct their attention on approach to urban RLXs located in busy shopping strip areas, and whether this differs between novice and experienced drivers. Participants drove an instrumented vehicle around a pre-defined urban route containing several active (flashing light with boom barriers) RLXs. Drivers’ visual scanning behaviour and cognitive processes were examined on approach to RLXs. The results suggest that RLXs were not a key focus of drivers’ attention. Further, rather than actively scanning, participants were over-reliant on RLX warning signals and the behaviour of surrounding vehicles to alert them {{to the presence of}} both trains and RLXs.

Such anomalous roughness data can result in higher average network roughness and trigger false characterisation.

The findings of this exercise indicate that the use of available measures to characterise anomalous roughness is not feasible.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{collisions}} between road users and trains at <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> (RLXs) remains resistant to current countermeasures. One factor underpinning these collisions is poor Situation Awareness (SA) {{on behalf of}} the road user involved (i. e. not being aware of an approaching train). Although this is a potential threat at any RLX, the factors influencing SA may differ depending on whether the RLX is located in a rural or urban road environment. Despite this, there has been no empirical investigation regarding how road user SA might differ across distinct RLX environments. This knowledge is needed to establish {{the extent to which a}} uniform approach to RLX design and safety is acceptable. The aim of this paper is to investigate the differences in driver SA at rural versus urban RLXs. We present analyses of driver SA in both rural and urban RLX environments based on two recent on-road studies undertaken in Victoria, Melbourne. The findings demonstrate that driver SA is markedly different at rural and urban RLXs, and also that poor SA regarding approaching trains may be caused by different factors.

Participants represented RLX stakeholder organisations (i. e. government departments, regulators, road authorities, road user peak bodies, investigators) or were interested persons with a professional interest in the research (i. e. researchers, designers). The workshop incorporated exercises to promote creativity, a systems thinking perspective and a human-centred perspective to design. Three innovative design concepts were generated. At the conclusion of the workshops, participants evaluated the design process against the methodological criteria. Further, the three design concepts were assessed by human factors experts to determine their alignment with STS and their overall effectiveness for improving safety. Overall, participants indicated that the design approach was useful and that STS is appropriate for public safety contexts. Further, the experts indicated that the new designs would be more effective than existing RLX designs. However, their ratings suggested that the design concepts did not fully align with STS. Implications of the findings for public safety design will be discussed...|$|R

Several issues are discussed in this paper including legal issues associated with the treatment of low-exposure passive crossings with low cost level crossing warning devices (LCLCWDs); principles of operation and deployment for LCLCWDs; and technical and human factors aspects of safety and availability. The Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) for <b>Rail</b> Innovation’s affordable <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> project aims to address {{a number of these}} technical and human factors issues through research and field trials...|$|R

25|$|In Finland, <b>level</b> <b>{{crossings}}</b> (tasoylikäytävä or tasoristeys in Finnish) with {{warning lights}} have {{the more common}} red light(s) and a white light that flashes except when the red light(s) flash. Most, but not all, crossings with lights also have barriers. Full-length barriers are usually used only for pedestrian and bicycle lanes. Half-length barriers are used for motor roads, to avoid {{the risk of a}} vehicle being trapped on the tracks between the barriers. Bells begin to ring when the red lights start flashing and usually stop when the barriers have come down. Red-and-yellow crossbuck is used on both controlled and uncontrolled <b>level</b> <b>crossings.</b> If there are two or more tracks, {{the lower part of the}} cross is doubled. Only minor agricultural crossings might have no signs at all. On bigger roads there are usually also approach signs as seen in the picture. Finnish <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> are the sixth safest in Europe. Finland's state railway system has almost 3000 <b>level</b> <b>crossings,</b> according to TraFi. In Finland over the course of railway history many level crossing accidents have occurred, in comparison to other Scandinavian countries. In Finland the maximum speed for trains on the <b>rails</b> with <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> is 140km/h.|$|R
40|$|Pedestrian {{safety at}} <b>rail</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> (RLXs) {{is a concern}} for governments and the community. There is sparse {{published}} literature, however, that has investigated pedestrian situation awareness when negotiating RLXs. This paper presents the findings from an exploratory study of pedestrian situation awareness at RLXs. Fifteen participants {{took part in a}} naturalistic study in which participants walked a pre-defined route in one of three urban environments, each of which incorporated two RLXs. Whilst walking the route participants wore video recording glasses and provided 'think aloud' verbal protocols describing the cognitive processes and decision making underpinning their behaviour. Analysis of the verbal protocols provided during the approach and traversal of the RLX was conducted using content analysis software as well as through manual analysis of the data. The analysis identified that pedestrian situation awareness was most commonly underpinned by concepts such as the 'railway crossing', the 'train' and other 'pedestrians'. Interestingly, concepts such as 'bells', 'flashing lights' and the ‘pedestrian gate' were not prominent. This may reflect that most participants did not encounter the RLX when a train was approaching. However, concepts around checking for the train were prominent suggesting that many pedestrians may not simply rely on automatic warnings, but use their own judgement {{to make a decision about}} when it is safe to cross a RLX. Further findings, implications for RLX design, limitations and future research directions will be discussed...|$|R
