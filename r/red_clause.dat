5000|$|<b>Red</b> <b>Clause</b> [...] - [...] Before {{sending the}} products, seller {{can take the}} {{pre-paid}} part of {{the money from the}} bank. The first part of the credit is {{to attract the attention of}} the accepting bank. The first time the credit is established by the assigner bank, is to gain the attention of the offered bank. The terms and conditions were typically written in red ink, thus the name.|$|E
40|$|Commercial {{letters of}} credit {{facilitate}} {{the movement of}} goods into the channels of trade. A letter of credit is a written undertaking by a bank (issuing bank), acting at the request and on the instructions of its customer (applicant for the credit) to make payment to, or to the order of, a third party (the beneficiary). For a credit to be transferable, the exporter must arrange for the importer to have a credit opened expressly stipulating that is transferable. A beneficiary may require financing in order to complete the manufacturing of merchandise or to purchase items to fill a particular order. A <b>red</b> <b>clause</b> credit helps achieve this. The applicant and beneficiary may wish to have a letter of credit structured to satisfy a long term contract requiring the constant supply of merchandise over a specific time period. This can be accomplished with a revolving letter of credit. Key words: letter of credit, issuing bank, advising bank, payments, negotiatio...|$|E
40|$|We {{prove that}} {{deciding}} whether the edge set of a graph can be partitionned into two spanning trees with orientation constraints is NP-complete. If P 6 = NP, this disproves a conjecture of Recski [1]. Let G = (V,E) be a graph. Orienting an edge uv ∈ E means replacing the edge uv by an arc uv or an arc vu. For m ∈ ZV+, an m-orientation of F ⊆ E is an {{orientation of the}} edges in F such {{that the number of}} arcs of F leaving v is m(v) for each v ∈ V. Given b, r ∈ ZV+, a (b, r) -partition of E is a partition of E into a blue and a red spanning tree such that the blue tree has a b-orientation and the red tree has an r-orientation. Recski [1] conjectured that the existence of a (b, r) -partition can be decided in polynomial time. The following theorem anwsers negatively this question if P 6 = NP. Theorem 1. Let G = (V,E) be a graph and b, r ∈ ZV+. Deciding whether there exists a (b, r) -partition of E is NP-complete. To prove this result we give a reduction of an instance of NotAllEqual 3 -Sat. In such an instance, each clause consists of three non-negated vari-ables and an assignment is a coloring of the variables with blue or <b>red.</b> A <b>clause</b> is satisfied if it contains both a blue and a red variable. Schaefer [2] proved that this variation of Sat is NP-complete. Theorem 2 ([2]). NotAllEqual 3 -Sat is NP-complete. Let Π be an instance of NotAllEqual 3 -Sat and denote n the number of clauses. We will define a graph G(Π) = (V,E) on 12 n+ 1 vertices and two outdegree vectors b, r ∈ ZV+ with the following property...|$|R
