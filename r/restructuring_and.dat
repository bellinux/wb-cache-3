The plan included $160 million in cost cutting and returning $3 billion to shareholders over three years by buying shares and increasing dividends. It also consolidated many product and R groups, putting a major emphasis on the market segments of Web 2.0, Cloud-Builder & High-IQ Networks. According to Network World, Elliot Management {{was pleased with the}} plan.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of heavy industry attracted thousands of European {{immigrants in the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries, as well as internal migrants, both black and white, from the rural and small town South.

5|$|Fluor {{was founded}} in 1912 by John Simon Fluor as Fluor Construction Company. It grew quickly, {{predominantly}} by building oil refineries, pipelines and other facilities for {{the oil and gas}} industry, at first in California, and then in the Middle East and globally. In the late 1960s, it began diversifying into oil drilling, coal mining and other raw materials like lead. A global recession in {{the oil and gas industry}} and losses from its mining operation led to <b>restructuring</b> <b>and</b> layoffs in the 1980s. Fluor sold its oil operations and diversified its construction work into a broader range of services and industries.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the Ministry of Justice {{considered}} reorganizing {{the search}} and rescue services, and looked into moving the 330 Squadron from Banak to Hammerfest Airport. The rationale was the proximity to Hammerfest Hospital and a typical 40-minute shorter flight time to the coast. However, such a location would give longer travel time to the inner parts of Finnmark. The plans were hindered by opposition from the Air Force, {{as they would have}} to establish a military station at Hammerfest. The Norwegian Armed Forces announced in 2007 that they would carry out a major <b>restructuring</b> <b>and</b> decrease of activity in Finnmark, with the long-term plan to close the Garrison of Porsanger.|$|E
5|$|The third administrator, James E. Webb (1961–1968), {{appointed}} by President John F. Kennedy, was a Democrat who first publicly served under President Harry S. Truman.

Capitalizing on Kennedy's legacy, President Lyndon Johnson kept continuity with the Apollo program by keeping Webb on when he succeeded Kennedy in November 1963. But Webb resigned in October 1968 before Apollo achieved its goal, and Republican President Richard M. Nixon replaced Webb with Republican Thomas O. Paine.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s Credit Suisse began {{catering}} to consumers and the middle-class with deposit counters, currency exchanges and savings accounts. The first branch outside of Zürich was opened in 1905 in Basel. The bank helped companies affected by World War I <b>restructuring,</b> <b>and</b> extended loans for reconstruction efforts. During the 1920s depression, net profits and dividends were halved and employees took salary cuts. After World War II, {{a substantial portion}} of Credit Suisse's business was in foreign reconstruction efforts. Holocaust survivors had problems trying to retrieve assets from relatives that died in concentration camps without death certificates. This led to a class action lawsuit in 1996 that settled in 2000 for $1.25 billion. The Agreement on the Swiss Banks' Code of Conduct with Regard to the Exercise of Due Diligence was created in the 1970s, after a Credit Suisse branch in Chiasso was exposed for illegally funneling $900 million in Italian deposits to speculative investments.|$|E
5|$|Narvesen had an {{exclusive}} agreement with NSB to operate newsagent's shops at all railway stations, except in stations with restaurants, which were operated by Spisevognselskapet. Narvesen had a near-monopoly on newsagents in Norway, and rented facilities in many public places. The owners of Narvesen intended {{to create a}} foundation to obtain the company; when plans for this started in 1972, they had difficulties {{finding a way to}} transfer shares to the foundation without having to pay tax on the transaction. However, the tax laws permitted a tax-free transaction if {{it was part of a}} restructuring. A merger with Spisevognselskapet would be considered a <b>restructuring,</b> <b>and</b> in 1974 Fritt Ord was established to take over Narvesen's owners' share of the company. The agreement between Narvesen and NSB was made in July 1974; in December it was passed by Parliament, although the Conservative Party and Progress Party voted against the merger. A.S Narvesen–Spisevognselskapet was established on 1 January 1975. Fritt Ord owned 50% of the new company and NSB 41%. It assumed the Narvesen name in 1979.|$|E
5|$|On 6November 1981, the Governor-General, Sir Zelman Cowen, {{presented}} the Queen's Colour to No.1 AD. By September {{the following year}} the depot's strength was down to 235 staff, but it pioneered the support of various new technologies for the Air Force, in fields such as electroplating, fibre optics, and electronics. It was also responsible for developing and testing components for the F-111, Macchi MB-326 and McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet jets. From 1986, <b>restructuring</b> <b>and</b> outsourcing began to impact heavily upon the RAAF's technical services. In February 1990, No.1 AD came {{under the control of}} Logistics Command, formed when Support Command was split into logistical and training components. By then the depot's functions had largely been taken over by other units and private contractors, and it was disbanded on 2December 1994. No.1 AD was, at the time, the oldest RAAF unit in continuous operation and, according to the RAAF Historical Section, the oldest continuously operating maintenance depot of any air force.|$|E

5|$|On June 27, 1955, the Howard Beach station, {{along with}} all the rest of the Rockaway Beach Branch {{stations}} south of the now defunct Ozone Park station, was taken out of service for eight months for <b>restructuring</b> <b>and</b> upgrading of the tracks, so that they could accommodate subway service. During the project, the Howard Beach station, along with the Broad Channel and Far Rockaway stations, was completely rebuilt utilizing a modern design, which included a new overhead passageway between the two platforms. The design was created by architect J. Harold Sandifer, a native of the Rockaways. Many of the parts for the station were prefabricated, speeding construction. On June 28, 1956, the station reopened as a subway station along with the rest of the line. The previous Long Island Rail Road station at this location was razed. Inauguration ceremonies were held at the station as well as at Euclid Avenue in Brooklyn.|$|E
5|$|The {{specialized}} hardware of graphics processing units (GPU) {{is designed}} to accelerate rendering of 3-Dgraphics applications such as video games and can significantly outperform CPUs for some types of calculations. GPUs {{are one of the}} most powerful and rapidly growing computing platforms, and many scientists and researchers are pursuing general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU). However, GPU hardware is difficult to use for non-graphics tasks and usually requires significant algorithm <b>restructuring</b> <b>and</b> an advanced understanding of the underlying architecture. Such customization is challenging, more so to researchers with limited software development resources. Folding@home uses the open source OpenMM library, which uses a bridge design pattern with two application programming interface (API) levels to interface molecular simulation software to an underlying hardware architecture. With the addition of hardware optimizations, OpenMM-based GPU simulations need no significant modification but achieve performance nearly equal to hand-tuned GPU code, and greatly outperform CPU implementations.|$|E
5|$|The stadium {{has four}} stands. The Main Stand (renamed the Garrison Lane Stand from 2010 to 2012), a {{free-standing}} structure {{on the north}} side of the playing area, was completed in 1954 and has seating for fewer than 5,000 spectators. The upper tier contains the media area and an area of corporate seats as well as standard seating. The lower tier, known as the Paddocks, consists of a few rows of seats placed on the uncovered terraced area in front of the stand; the view from this area can be obstructed by the central tunnel and the dugouts. A row of executive boxes was added at the back of the Paddocks in the 1970s. The family area is divided between the eastern end of the Main Stand and the Paddock beneath. The club planned £1.3million worth of <b>restructuring</b> <b>and</b> refurbishment work on the stand, which contained hospitality areas and offices, during the 2009 closed season, and seating was replaced in 2010. The broadcasting gantry is situated in the roof of this stand.|$|E

5|$|ToeJam & Earl and its sequel ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkatron {{together}} formed {{one of the}} Mega Drive's main series. However, creator Greg Johnson {{said that}} installments for the console's Mega-CD or 32X add-ons were never planned, and though rumors of a new game persisted throughout the commercial life of the Sega Saturn console, that system's poor performance in North America prevented development of a sequel. Johnson and programmer Mark Voorsanger regained the rights to ToeJam and Earl in 1995, and in November 1998 made an agreement with GT Interactive to publish a new game in the franchise for the Nintendo 64. Johnson and Voorsanger conducted research to determine whether series fans preferred the original ToeJam & Earl or its sequel; the former emerged as the clear favorite. In April 1999, however, {{it was reported that}} the deal with GT Interactive had fallen through; the publisher had decided that the series' previous game was not an encouraging success commercially, particularly in Europe. GT Interactive's <b>restructuring</b> <b>and</b> the Nintendo 64's declining commercial performance were also believed to be factors by commentators.|$|E
5|$|With {{a payroll}} of 6,632 at March 1990, the airline had {{a fleet of}} three Airbus A310-200s, three Boeing 707-320Cs, eight Boeing 737-200s and two DC-10-30s. A large {{domestic}} network serving the 19 Nigerian states was operated, as well as routes to East and West Africa; intercontinental flights from Lagos to Amsterdam, Jeddah, London, New York and Rome, from Kano to Amsterdam, Jeddah, London and Rome, and from Port Harcourt to London were also undertaken. The carrier suffered a major accident on 11 July 1991, when all 261 people on board a Douglas DC-8-61, registration C-GMXQ, crashed near Jeddah. In 1992, Nigeria Airways had three Boeing 707s impounded in Europe, {{and the number of}} flights experienced a 32% reduction following the termination of services to Conakry, Freetown and Robertsfield (Monrovia). Privatisation was first considered in 1993 with a proposal to split Nigeria Airways in two companies, one bearing the same name and operating domestic routes and a new one named Air Nigeria, which would undertake the international operations. In July 1994, an Airbus was impounded at London Heathrow Airport owing to a debt worth ₤100,000. On 21 December of the same year, a Boeing 707, registration 5N-ABK, crashed near Hadejia on a freighter flight from Jeddah, killing three of a crew of five. Further staff reductions continued throughout {{the first half of the}} 1990s, and at September 1995 the airline had 4,500 employees. In 1997 the UK Civil Aviation Authority banned the airline from operating into its territory citing safety concerns; in return, the Nigerian government barred British Airways from operating in the country. The service was restored in 1998 when the carrier began codesharing with British Airways, deploying a leased Boeng 747-200 that wore a Nigeria Airways livery and was operated on the Lagos–London Heathrow route with mixed English and Nigerian crews. By the late 1990s, the Nigerian government decided the carrier would be privatised by selling 40% and 20% to foreign and local investors, respectively, and keeping the rest of the shares. In 1999, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) was commissioned by the Nigerian government to assist in the process of <b>restructuring</b> <b>and</b> privatisation of the airline. Among three options, one of them was to partner with a large European airline; Air France, British Airways, German-based Lufthansa, Swissair and the British carrier Virgin were all considered. Another alternative was to liquidate the carrier.|$|E
