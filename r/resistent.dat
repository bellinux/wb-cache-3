Low SAM, {{the product}} of MAT genes, content favors HCC development in rodents and humans. Overall DNA hypomethylation, associated with promoter hypermethylation and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, occurs during liver carcinogenesis (HCC). These observations suggest the implication of epigenetic regulation of MAT isozymes expression in HCC development. We investigated the prognostic role of MAT 1 A:MAT 2 A ratio, and the regulation of MAT 1 A and MAT 2 A expression through the methylation status of promoter and mRNA stability during progression of hepatocarcinogenesis. Methods : We performed Mat 1 A and Mat 2 A Promoter Methylation, Quantitative Real-Time Reverse Trascription, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation assay, RNA protein interaction, Western Blot Analysis in rat and humans samples. Results : Our results show a marked decrease of Mat 1 A expression and MATI/III activity, {{and an increase in}} Mat 2 A expression and MATII activity in DN and HCC of F 344 rats, and in samples human SLP and HCCP compared with normal liver, whereas low/no changes in DN and HCC of <b>resistents</b> BN rats and in human SLB and HCCB compared with normal liver. These results have been associated with CCGG methylation Mat 1 A of promoter, and CCGG hypomethylation of Mat 2 A promoter.

En la present tesi a partir de la seqüenciació de tres gens estructurals (quitina sintasa, &# 946;-tubulina i calmodulina) es demostra que S. schenckii és un complex d'espècies filogenètiques. 	S'ha realitzat un exhaustiu estudi fenotípic d'aquestes espècies i, combinant alguns dels diferents caràcters morfològics i fisiològics estudiats [presència/absència i morfologia de conidis sèssils pigmentats, taxes de creixement de les colònies (30, 35 i 37 ºC) i assimilació de sacarosa, rafinosa i ribitol], es descriuen tres noves espècies per a la ciència: S. globosa, S. brasiliensis i S. mexicana.

En l'estudi de la patogènia en ratolins s'han trobat diferències en la virulència de les espècies del complex, essent S. brasiliensis i S. schenckii les més patògenes. Summary PhD Thesis Molecular and phenotypic characterization of Sporothrix schenckii 	 	Sporothrix schenckii is the pathogenic dimorphic fungus responsible for sporothrichosis, an important fungal infection with a worldwide distribution. Recently, molecular and phenotypic data seem {{to demonstrate that}} different genetic lineages exist within this species. For this reason we performed a morphological and molecular study involving numerous strains of clinical and environmental origins and from different countries. The analysis of partial sequences of the quitin synthase, &# 946;-tubulin and calmodulin genes demonstrated that S. schenckii is a species complex. A combined analysis of the sequences of the three loci of 60 strains from different origins showed 6 phylogenetic species within this species demonstrating {{that most of these}} species prevail in different geographical regions. Since the delineation of of such species could be of extreme importance from a clinical point of view, we studied a total of 127 isolates, most of which were received as S. schenckii, including the available type strain of species currently considered synonyms, and also some close morphological species. We have phenotypically characterized all these isolates using different culture media, growth rates at different temperatures, and numerous nutritional tests and compared their calmodulin gene sequences, which previously was revealed as the most informative molecular marker of the three evaluated. The molecular analysis revealed that Sporothrix albicans, S. inflate and S. schenckii var. luriei are species that are clearly different from S. schenckii. The combination of these phonetic and genetic approaches allowed us to propose the new species Sporothrix brasiliensis, S. globosa, S. mexicana and S. luriei. The key phenotypic featudes for recognizing these species are the morphology of the sessile pigmented conidia, growth at 30, 35, and 37 ºC, and the assimilation of sucrose, raffinose, and ribitol. 	In this thesis we also evaluated the in vitro activities of 12 drugs (amphotericin B, albaconazole, fluconazole, eberconazole itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, ravuconazole, voriconazole, terbinafine, micafungin and flucytosine) by using the microdilution method following the CLSI guidelines against 92 isolates belonging to the six species that constitute the sporotrhix schenckii complex. There were significant differences among the species, Sporothrix brasiliensis was the species that showed the best response to antifungals and S. mexicana was the worst. In general, terbinafine was the most active drug, followed by ketoconazole and posaconazole. 		 	Another objective of the present thesis was to perform a comparative study on the experimental pathogenicity of six species of Sporothrix of clinical interest, i. e. S. albicans, S. brasiliensis, S. globosa, S. mexicana, S. luriei and S. schenckii sensu stricto, it was performed using a murine model with immunocompetent mice. We used two different inocula, i. e., 1 x 108 conidia/ml and 1 x 105 conidia/ml, for each fungal strain tested. Two isolates of each species were used. Two inocula of each isolate, i. e. 1 x 108 and 1 x 105 conidia/ml, were tested, the animals being infected intravenously. Only the low inoculum of one isolate of S. brasiliensis and the high inoculum of the isolates of S. brasiliensis and S. schenckii were able to cause 100 % mortality.

40|$|Electrodeposition {{involves}} chemical phenomena {{associated with}} charge separation and transfer {{that can occur}} homogeneously in solution, or heterogeneously over electrode surfaces. In order to assure electroneutrality at least two charge transfer half-reactions should take place. In the case of heterogeneous redox reactions, these half-reactions occur over two different electrodes immersed in a solution. It presents several advantatges over other methods commonly used to prepare films and structures which require vacuum conditions, physical or chemical vapor deposition (PVD or CVD), plasma enhanced deposition (PLD), sputtering. One of these advantages is its low cost and high simplicity of the experimental setup. The equipment used is cheap and maintenance is hardly required. On the other hand, room temperature is commonly used to grow the material or, at least, temperatures lower than 100 °C. Nowadays electrodeposition is used {{in a wide range}} of applications as metal processing and finishing. Electroplating is a process widely used in industry for coating metal objects with a thin layer of a different metal. It is one of the most important in terms of volume of production, and it also has one of the greatest economic impacts. The purpose of these coatings is to provide the metal object with some desired property that the metal object does not have. Electrodeposition has come a long way since its inception; developing new techniques that have increased the range of applications of the same. This thesis mainly focuses on the new applications and uses of electrodeposition as a tool of fabricating some materials that can be integrated in different kind of devices such as sensors and actuators. Electrodeposition has a high materials and structures versatility that can be obtained which permits its integration in lots of processes. In this tesis different applications for electrodeposition have been studied: First of all, the design, preparation and characterisation of planar coils to be implemented in inductive biosensors has been performed. It was necessary to perform the study of the optimum bath, electrodeposition conditions and fabrication processes to prepare robust, low resistant and adherent planar copper coils of different aspect ratios, which allow detecting magnetic particles. In order to do that, simulations of the main parameters based in previous designs to improve the sensitivity of the coils have been executed. The final objectives were the fabrication of the new designed coils and to perform the first tests of their sensing ability. Then, the deposition of a hard magnetic alloy for MEMS application has been tested. A basic study of the electrodeposition process of the CoPt alloy to find the optimum bath has been performed. Structures with different shapes and geometries (films, thin films, photolitographied microstructures, nanoparticles, nanowires [...] .) over different substrates have been obtained applying the conditions based on the previous electrochemical results. The influence of the electrodeposition and preparation conditions on the properties of the CoPt alloy (morphology, composition, crystalline structure, magnetic properties,) and analysis of the relationship among those properties has been studied. Finally, the organic monolayer formation on top of several electrodeposited magnetic substrates (magnetic/non-magnetic assembly) as the first step to fabricate a molecular spintronic device has been performed. The preparation of smooth thin films of magnetite and CoP by means of electrodeposition and the formation and study of octanethiol and acid oleic monolayers on top have been achieved as the first step to obtain a molecular spintronic device. Electrodeposition has been demonstrated to be a useful technique for the design and fabrication of micro/nanomaterials with specific properties that allow them to be implemented in biosensors, MEMS and molecular spintronic devices. Aquesta tesi es centra principalment en les noves aplicacions i usos de l'electrodeposició com a eina de fabricació de nous materials que poden ser integrats en diferents tipus de dispositius com ara sensors i actuadors. L'electrodeposició presenta diversos avantatges respecte a altres tècniques, sobre tot respecte aquelles que utilitzen el buit. Els objectius específics plantejats en aquesta tesi han estat en primer lloc el disseny, preparació i caracterització de bobines planes per fabricar biosensors inductius. Per això ha calgut escollir el bany i les condicions de treball òptims, així com els processos de fabricació més adequats a seguir per tal de preparar bobines planes de coure <b>resistents,</b> robustes, ben definides i adherents amb diferents relacions d'aspecte, que siguin capaces de detectar partícules magnètiques. També s'han realitzat càlculs simulant els principals paràmetres de les bobines per millorar-ne la sensibilitat. En una etapa posterior, s'han fabricat les noves bobines dissenyades i s'han dut a terme les primeres proves de la capacitat de detecció. En segon lloc, es va proposar la deposició d'un aliatge magnètic dur per a la seva aplicació en MEMS. L'aliatge escollit va ser el CoPt. Per tal de trobar un bany òptim per a la seva deposició s'ha dut a terme l'estudi bàsic del procés d'electrodeposició de l'aliatge. S'han preparat estructures amb diferents formes i geometries (dipòsits, pel•lícules primes, microestructures, nanopartícules, nanofils, [...] .) sobre diferents substrats i s'ha estudiat la influència de les condicions d'electrodeposició sobre les propietats de l'aliatge de CoPt (morfologia, composició, estructura cristal•lina, propietats magnètiques, [...] .) i s'ha realitzat l'anàlisi de la relació entre aquestes propietats. Per últim, s'ha dut a terme un estudi inicial de la formació de monocapes orgàniques sobre diferents substrats magnètics, com al primer pas per fabricar un dispositiu d'espintrònica molecular. Per aquest motiu s'han preparat pel•lícules primes de magnetita i d'aliatge CoP per mitjà de l'electrodeposició i s'ha dut a terme l'estudi de la formació de les monocapes d'octanotiol i d'àcid oleic sobre els substrat...|$|R
40|$|CHAPTER 1 : Respiratory Infectious Diseases (RID) are {{diseases}} {{affecting the}} air passages, the bronchi and the lungs. They range from acute infections, such as pneumonia and bronchitis, to chronic {{conditions such as}} asthma, cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Respiratory lung infections are leading causes {{of morbidity and mortality}} worldwide with a considerable human, social and financial burden. RID can be caused by an increasing number of multi resistant bacteria to the existing antibiotics. Bacteria, which normally inhabit the mucus, grow out of control and consequently colonize and infect the lungs. The altered mucus leads to formation of bacterial microenvironments known as biofilms, which are difficult for antibiotics and inmunitary cells to penetrate. A potential key enzyme of bacteria, associated with chronic lung infections, to be targeted by antiproliferative drugs are ribonucleotide reductase enzymes (RNR). RNR enzyme provides deoxyribonucleotides for DNA synthesis which are needed for growth and spore germination of the pathogen. Inhibition of RNR enzymes could be a valuable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of RID. In the literature, {{it has been suggested that}} hydroxyurea (HU) and N-hydroxylamine derivatives can be used as antiproliferative drugs against bacterial lung infections. Therefore, a library of these compounds was synthesized and evaluated against four different bacteria lines: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia cenocepacia and Bacillus anthracis; all of them are opportunistic infectious pathogens affecting respiratory system. CHAPTER 2 : Mitofusin- 2 (Mfn 2) participates in mitochondrial fusion and moreover, regulates mitochondrial metabolism. We have previously reported that Mfn 2 is down regulated in muscle from obese or type 2 diabetic patients, and recently we have demonstrated that Mfn 2 deficiency in liver or muscle leads to glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in mice. Therefore, activators of Mfn 2 expression could be used as a valuable potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. For this purpose, we decided to search activators of mitofusin- 2 expression by High Throughput Screening using a FDA-approved library. HeLa cells stably expressing luciferase under the control of 2 kb of human Mfn 2 promoter were incubated with the library and compound LM 1 was identified as a potent activator of Mfn 2 transcriptional activity. Importantly, LM 1 increased Mfn 2 expression in HeLa and C 2 C 12 cells. Furthermore, LM 1 also induced the expression of the mitochondrial fusion protein Mfn 1 and repressed the mitochondrial fission protein Drp 1 in both cell lines. LM 1 modulates the mitochondrial proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics producing an elongation of the mitochondrial network. In addition, LM 1 was able to increase Mfn 2, Mfn 1 and OPA 1 protein levels and promoted mitochondrial elongation in MEFwt, MEF Mfn 2 -/- and MEF Mfn 1 -/- cells. However, mitochondrial elongation is more dependent of Mfn 1 than Mfn 2 due to the higher mitochondrial elongation of MEF Mfn 2 -/- compared to MEF Mfn 1 -/- cells. LM 1 decreases the synthesis of pyrimidines by inhibiting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), which causes cell stress and p 53 activation by phosphorylation at Ser 15. p 53 triggers Mfns up-regulation promoting mitochondrial elongation. The addition of external uridine, which reverses the deficiency in pyrimidines synthesis, prevents p 53 and Mfns increase in C 2 C 12 cells. Moreover, LM 2, an inhibitor of complex III that indirectly inhibit DHODH, and consequently pyrimidine synthesis, also up-regulates p 53 producing an increase in Mfns protein expression. LM 2 also promotes mitochondrial elongation in HeLa, C 2 C 12 and MEFwt cells. 	 	We can conclude that the depletion of pyrimidine pools, by complex III or DHODH inhibitors, cause cell stress, and trigger p 53 accumulation and activation by p 53 phosphorylation at Ser 15, which causes cell cycle arrest. p 53 up-regulates Mfns and down-regulates Drp 1 promoting mitochondrial elongation that confer stress resistance on cells. Therefore, mitochondrial elongation represents an adaptive response against cell stress caused by LM 1 and LM 2. CAPÍTOL 1 : Les malalties respiratòries infeccioses com per exemple la pneumònia, la bronquitis, la fibrosis quística i la malaltia pulmonar obstructiva crònica són les principals causes de morbidesa i mortalitat a tot el món. Aquestes infeccions són causades per un nombre creixent de bacteris multi <b>resistents</b> als antibiòtics que existeixen actualment. 	 Uns enzims indispensables pels bacteris són els enzims ribonucleòtids reductases (RNR), els quals produeixen els desoxiribonucleòtids per la síntesi d’ADN. Una molècula capaç d’inhibir l’enzim RNR pararia el creixement del bacteri, esdevenint una estratègia terapèutica en el tractament de les malalties respiratòries infeccioses. La hidroxiurea i els derivats de la N-hidroxilamina són inhibidors de l’enzim RNR. Per tant, vam decidir sintetitzar una llibreria d’hidroxilamines, a partir d’aldehids per aminació reductiva. Els compostos van ser avaluats en quatre línies diferents de bacteris: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Staphylococcus aureus i Bacillus anthracis, que causen infeccions oportunistes en pacients que pateixen malalties respiratòries. CAPÍTOL 2 : La mitofusina 2 és una proteïna mitocondrial que participa en la fusió mitocondrial i en regula el metabolisme. A més, Mfn 2 està disminuïda en el múscul de pacients que pateixen obesitat o diabetis de tipus 2. Per tant, activadors de l’expressió de Mfn 2 es podrien utilitzar com a tractament terapèutic. Per trobar activadors de Mfn 2 es va portar a terme un cribratge d’alt rendiment amb la llibreria de compostos Prestwick utilitzant les cèl•lules HeLa que expressen de forma estable la proteïna luciferasa sota el promotor humà de Mfn 2. El compost LM 1, que va ser identificat, augmenta l’expressió de les proteïnes de fusió Mfn 2, Mfn 1 i OPA 1, i disminueix la proteïna de fissió Drp 1 en cèl•lules, produint una elongació de la xarxa mitocondrial. El compost LM 1 i el LM 2, que inhibeixen l’enzim DHODH directa o indirectament, causen la disminució de la síntesi de pirimidines que produeix un estrès cel•lular i l’activació i acumulació de p 53. p 53 produeix una parada de cicle cel•lular i modula les proteïnes involucrades en dinàmica mitocondrial promovent l’elongació mitocondrial.

40|$|Backbone N-methylation is {{becoming}} an increasingly important tool in peptide drug design, and has been widely used to optimize the activity and selectivity of peptide ligands {{as a result of}} conformational modulation. However, no systematic research has been conducted on modifying the peptide backbone with other N-alkyl substituents. The present doctoral thesis is aimed at introducing novel N-substituents into peptides, and comparing the conformational and biological properties of the resulting N-substituted peptides with those of their N-Me homologues. In a first project, we studied the effect of replacing backbone N-Me groups by an N-triethylene glycol (N-TEG) chain on hydrophobicity and conformation. For that, we chose Sansalvamide A peptide as a model, and we incorporated N-Me and N-TEG amino acids at the different positions of its cyclopentapeptide structure. We found that Fmoc-protected amino acids bearing the N-TEG group [i. e. N-CH 2 CH 2 (OCH 2 CH 2) 2 OCH 3] can be easily prepared in solution, and they are straightforward to incorporate into a resin-bound peptide. The acylation of N-TEG amines can be achieved in solid-phase by activating the following amino acid with triphosgene. In this way, N-TEG peptides are accessible by the same synthetic repertoire as that already established for N-Me peptides. Comparison of NMR data of our N-TEG vs. N-Me analogs gives evidence of similar conformational preferences for those peptides with the same N-alkylation pattern. Furthermore, comparison of their chromatographic retention parameters indicates that the incorporation of an N-TEG chain into a peptide provides a higher hydrophobicity than an N-Me group. In a second study, we chose Cilengitide as model peptide, and we replaced its backbone N-Me group by various N-oligoethylene glycol (N-OEG) chains of increasing size: namely N-OEG 2, N-OEG 11, and N-OEG 23, which are respectively composed of 2, 11 and 23 ethylene oxide monomer units. The N-OEG 2 cyclopeptide analog was straightforward to synthesize in solid-phase, using the same methodology as for the N-TEG analogs of Sansalvamide A peptide. The syntheses of the N-OEG 11 and N-OEG 23 cyclopeptides are hampered due to the increased steric hindrance exerted by the N-substituent, and could only be achieved by segment coupling, which takes place with epimerization and thus requires extensive product purification. The different N-OEG cyclopeptide analogs and the parent peptide were compared with respect to biological activity and lipophilicity. The N-OEG 2 analog displayed the same capacity as Cilengitide to inhibit integrin-mediated adhesion of HUVEC and DAOY cells to their ligands vitronectin and fibrinogen. The N-OEG 11 and N-OEG 23 analogs also inhibited cell adhesion, though with less potency. Thus, replacement of the backbone N-Me group of Cilengitide by a short N-OEG chain provides a more lipophilic analog with a similar biological activity. Upon increasing the size of the N-OEG chain, lipophilicity is enhanced, but synthetic yields drop and the longer polymer chains may impede receptor binding. On the basis of our finding that N-alkyl chains exert similar conformational constraints as a backbone N-Me group when incorporated into a cyclic peptide, we studied the N-(4 -azidobutyl) group as a linker to permit conjugation in peptides that lack derivatizable groups (i. e. N-terminus, C-terminus, and side-chain functionalities). We developed a robust strategy for the introduction of this linker into a peptide using standard solid-phase peptide synthesis techniques. With this methodology, we synthesized an analog of Cilengitide in which its backbone N-Me group was replaced by the N-(4 -azidobutyl) group. This N-(4 -azidobutylated) analog was used to prepare several conjugates with a polydisperse PEG chain (2 KDa), showing that our linker allows conjugation either via click chemistry or -after azide reduction- via acylation or reductive alkylation. This linker is orthogonal to protecting groups and resins commonly used in peptide chemistry, and chemically inert {{to a wide range of}} functionalities. NMR data indicated that Cilengitide and its N-(4 -azidobutylated) analog have the same backbone conformation. Therefore, substitution of a backbone N-Me group by the N-(4 -azidobutyl) linker is a valuable strategy to provide a reactive site for the attachment of molecules whilst preserving the original peptide sequence and conformation. In summary, we have found that peptides bearing larger N-substituents than an N-Me group can be easily synthesized, but difficulties arise upon increasing the size of N-alkyl group. For Sansalvamide A peptide and Cilengitide, replacement of a backbone N-Me group by a short N-OEG chain resulted in analogs with similar biological activity and conformational features. This concept was then employed for the design of the N-(4 -azidobutyl) linker, which allows bioorthogonal conjugation of a desired molecule with minimal perturbation of a target peptide structure. Considering the high abundance of N-Me groups in biologically active peptides, we contend that modification at this position is a feasible alternative to introduce chemical diversity or alter pharmacologically important parameters when modification at any other position of the peptide is not wished or possible. En química medicinal, la N-metilació de l’esquelet peptídic s’ha utilitzat àmpliament per a imposar restriccions conformacionals en pèptids i així optimitzar la seva activitat i selectivitat. D’altra banda, la introducció de grups N-Me en pèptids d’interès terapèutic també és una estratègia per a millorar la seva biodisponibilitat, ja que els pèptids N-metilats són més hidrofòbics, més <b>resistents</b> al trencament proteolític, i -en general- més permeables a través de les membranes biològiques. No obstant, s’han descrit molts pocs exemples en els quals s’hagi modificat l’esquelet peptídic amb d’altres grups N-alquil. Això es pot atribuir a la dificultat d’acilar residus N-alquilats amb grups més grans que N-Me, degut al major impediment estèric. L’objectiu principal de la present tesi ha estat explorar la viabilitat sintètica d’introduir nous N-substituents en pèptids, i comparar les propietats d’aquests nous pèptids N-substituïts amb les dels seus homòlegs N-metilats. En aquesta tesi demostrem que els pèptids modificats amb una cadena de N-trietilenglicol (N-TEG) es poden preparar amb mètodes ja establerts per a la síntesi de pèptids N-metilats. En incrementar la llargada de la cadena de N-oligoetilenglicol (N-OEG), l’acoblament sobre el residu N-alquilat no és viable en fase sòlida, però es pot aconseguir solució utilitzant un clorur d’àcid. Per a dos ciclopèptids model, vam sintetitzar diversos N-OEG anàlegs, i vam trobar que la introducció del grup N-OEG augmenta la hidrofobicitat de forma proporcional a la llargada de la cadena. També vam trobar que el reemplaçament del grup N-Me present en aquests pèptids per una cadena curta de N-OEG provoca una mínima pertorbació de la seva conformació i activitat biològica. En base aquesta observació, vam estudiar el grup N-(4 -azidobutil) com a linker per a permetre la conjugació en pèptids que no poseeixen grups funcionals derivatitzables. Demostrem que el grup N-(4 -azidobutil) es pot introduir en un pèptid utilitzant mètodes estàndard de síntesi en fase sòlida, i que la substitució d’un grup N-Me present en un pèptid pel nostre linker no altera la conformació del pèptid. També demostrem que grup N-(4 -azidobutil) permet la conjugació mitjançant diverses transformacions químiques. Es tracta d’un linker ortogonal a la majoria de grups protectors emprats en síntesi de pèptids, i químicament inert a una gran varietat de grups funcionals. En conclusió, la modificació de l’esquelet peptídic amb d’altres N-substituents més grans que N-Me és factible, però sorgeixen dificultats sintètiques en incrementar el tamany del grup N-alquil. Considerant que el grup N-Me es troba present en nombrosos pèptids biològicament actius, la seva substitució per d’altres entitats químiques és una alternativa viable per a introduir diversitat estructural o alterar propietats farmacològiques importants quan no és possible o no interessa modificar d’altres posicions d’un pèptid...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss a}} method to achieve {{decoherence}} <b>resistent</b> entanglement generation in two level spin systems governed by gapped and multi-degenerate Hamiltonians. In such systems, while {{the large number of}} degrees of freedom in the ground state levels allows to create various quantum superpositions, the energy gap prevents decoherence. We apply the protected evolution to achieve decoherence <b>resistent</b> generation of many particle GHZ states and show it can significantly increase the sensitivity in frequency spectroscopy. We discuss how to engineer the desired many-body protected manifold in two specific physical systems, trapped ions and neutral atoms in optical lattices, and present simple expressions for the fidelity of GHZ generation under non-ideal conditions.

40|$|Objectives: To know {{effect of}} {{hyperbaric}} oxygen therapy to GLUT 4 expression and folliculogenesis in rat PCOS with insulin <b>resistent</b> model. Materials and Methods: this is an analytic experimental study used 30 rats induced by testosterone propionate injection 1 mg/ 100 g body weight daily for 28 consecutive days as a PCOS with insulin <b>resistent</b> model. Animal models divided into 3 groups. Negative control was not given treatment, positive control was given placebo. Treatment group was given hyperbaric oxygen 2. 4 ATA 90 minutes 2 x 5 days. GLUT 4 expression determined by immunohystochemistry to m. Gastrocnemius. Hematoxylin Eosin staining to rat ovaries were performed to know differentiation in folliculogenesis. The results were then compared. Results: There were significant decrease of GLUT 4 expression in treatment group (mean 0, 84 + 0, 47) compared to negative and positive control (mean 3, 96 + 3, 16 and 3, 36 + 2, 17). There were no different folliculogenesis in these groups. Conclusion: Hyperbaric oxygen 2. 4 ATA 90 minutes 2 x 5 days induce decrease of GLUT 4 expression and no alterations in folliculogenesis in rat PCOS with insulin <b>resistent</b> model, therefore can not yet be used as alternative therapy in PCOS...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} <b>resistent</b> varieties of tomato in the term of susceptibility to late blight. Late blight, caused by P. infestans, is the most destructive foliar disease of tomato. Some new sorts declare the resistence to late blight. The aim of our thesis was to evaluate how these varieties perform in Czech republic. It was established experiment with 14 <b>resistent</b> and 2 control varieties. The leaves of the plants were examined routinely for symptoms of late blight and the severity of them was recorded. The varieties Mountain Magic, De Barao, Cherry Bomb, Tomato Des Comodores, Matts Wild Cherry a Plum Regal proved high level of resistence to late blight. The varieties Phantasia, Phytovia and Mountain Merit showed lower level of resistence. Growing new varieties, with resistence to late blight can enable the reduction of fungicidal protection of tomatoes and for organical and hobby growers to make possible growing tomatoes without use of pesticides...|$|E
