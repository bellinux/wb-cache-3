Results are shown from an ethanol fumigation study comprising of substitutions up to 50 % at full, three-quarter and half load. It has been demonstrated that at full load there is a decrease <b>in</b> <b>ignition</b> delay with increasing ethanol substitutions, whereas at half load there is an increase <b>in</b> <b>ignition</b> delay with increasing ethanol substitutions.

30|$|Empirical statistics-based {{models have}} also been used to analyse {{the effects of a}} cigarette’s {{physical}} properties on its ignition propensity (Hirschler 1997 a, 1997 b). In the early NIST studies (Gann et al. 1987), the decrease <b>in</b> <b>ignition</b> propensity observed with reduced cigarette circumference was thought to be due to a lower mass burn rate of tobacco, leading to a lower total heat transfer from the cigarette to the fabric substrate, and the decrease <b>in</b> <b>ignition</b> propensity with reduced paper permeability was thought to be due to decreased oxygen diffusion through the paper to sustain smouldering. Good predictions of these NIST results as a function of cigarette physical parameters were achieved with empirical statistics-based models.|$|R

40|$|Efforts {{to predict}} {{interfacial}} <b>residues</b> <b>in</b> protein-RNA complexes have largely focused on predicting RNA-binding <b>residues</b> <b>in</b> proteins. Computational methods for predicting protein-binding <b>residues</b> <b>in</b> RNA sequences, however, {{are a problem}} that has received relatively little attention to date. Although the value of sequence motifs for classifying and annotating protein sequences is well established, sequence motifs have not been widely applied to predicting interfacial <b>residues</b> <b>in</b> macromolecular complexes. Here, we propose a novel sequence motif-based method for “partner-specific” interfacial residue prediction. Given a specific protein-RNA pair, {{the goal is to}} simultaneously predict RNA binding <b>residues</b> <b>in</b> the protein sequence and protein-binding <b>residues</b> <b>in</b> the RNA sequence. In 5 -fold cross validation experiments, our method, PS-PRIP, achieved 92 % Specificity and 61 % Sensitivity, with a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0. 58 in predicting RNA-binding sites in proteins. The method achieved 69 % Specificity and 75 % Sensitivity, but with a low MCC of 0. 13 in predicting protein binding sites in RNAs. Similar performance results were obtained when PS-PRIP was tested on two independent “blind” datasets of experimentally validated protein- RNA interactions, suggesting the method should be widely applicable and valuable for identifying potential interfacial <b>residues</b> <b>in</b> protein-RNA complexes for which structural information is not available. The PS-PRIP webserver and datasets are available at: [URL]...|$|R

30|$|The {{development}} of the ASTM E 2187 standard was built on a partial understanding of the thermal processes involved <b>in</b> <b>ignition</b> by a smouldering cigarette, and the compromises inherent in its utility to mimic real-life situations of fire initiation.

Arguably, {{the availability of a}} commercial RIP solution has had the effect of diluting research efforts toward understanding the mechanisms involved <b>in</b> the <b>ignition</b> of upholstery fabrics and furniture by smouldering cigarettes which predated the two U.S. programs (1984 – 1987) and (1990 – 1993).|$|R
