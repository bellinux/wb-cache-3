5|$|On {{his arrival}} at Alexandria, Cleomenes {{was greeted by}} Ptolemy, who welcomed him with smiles and promises. At first Ptolemy was guarded towards Cleomenes, but soon came to <b>respect</b> <b>him</b> and promised to send him back to Greece with an army and a fleet. He also promised to provide Cleomenes with an annual income of twenty-four talents.

5|$|In {{preparation}} for {{her marriage to}} Mardjan, Atikah is secluded at home. Learning of this betrothal, Rachmat goes to Doerachman and, after fighting Mardjan and his men, takes the hadji to the village where he and Atikah had initiated development programs. As they had all worked in Doerachman's name, the villagers do not fear him, but <b>respect</b> <b>him.</b> This, {{and the extent of}} the developments, makes Doerachman realise that hoarding his wealth for himself does not make him as happy as using it for charity. The two, accompanied by Asmadi, hurry back to Doerachman's home, only to find Mardjan and his men sitting relaxedly on the front porch.|$|E
5|$|In the Matsya Purana, Ila was disinherited after {{becoming}} a female or kimpurusha. Ila's father passed his inheritance directly to Pururavas, ignoring the three sons Ila-Sudyumma bore as a male. Pururavas ruled from Pratishtanapura (present-day Allahabad), where Ila stayed with him. The Ramayana says that having returned to manhood, Ila ruled Pratishtana while his son Shashabindu ruled over Bahlika. The Devi-Bhagavata Purana tells {{that as a}} man Sudyumma governed the kingdom and as a woman remained indoors. His subjects were disturbed by his sex changes and did not <b>respect</b> <b>him</b> as they once had. When Pururavas attained adulthood, Sudyumma left his kingdom to Pururavas {{and went to the}} forest for penance. The sage Narada told Sudyumma a nine-syllable mantra, Navakshara, which would please the Supreme Goddess. Pleased with his austerities, the Goddess emerged before Sudyumma, who was in his female form Ilā. Sudyumma praised the Goddess, who merged the king's soul with herself and thus, Ilā gained salvation.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after this}} near-fatal incident, Nilsen's mother {{moved out of}} her mother's home and into a flat with her three {{children}}. She would later marry a builder named Andrew Scott, {{with whom she had}} four further children in as many years.

Hawkeye is then sponsored by his former enemy Iron Man, who sees that he is serious about becoming a hero. Led by Captain America, Hawkeye joins the team along with Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch to form the second incarnation of the Avengers. Almost straight away, Hawkeye clashes with his fellow Avengers. His romantic intentions towards the Scarlet Witch are met with hostility from her brother, Quicksilver. Hawkeye rebels against Captain America’s leadership (due to his past problems with authority figures), but over time comes to <b>respect</b> <b>him</b> as a mentor and a friend. When the Swordsman attempted to join the Avengers, Hawkeye warned them of his previous history with the villain.|$|E

All of Kentucky's living former Democratic governors were invited to participate, and each accepted the invitation with the exception of Brown. Of his refusal, Brown stated [...] "I don't <b>respect</b> <b>him.</b> I don't {{want to be part of}} it. I'm not really interested in being politically correct." [...] Referring to the 1987 Democratic gubernatorial primary campaign, Brown continued, [...] "He said things that were not true, like we had raised taxes. I just never respected him after that."

500|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{calls an}} {{emergency}} meeting asking everyone {{to come up}} with an idea to [...] "re-invigorate" [...] the office. Michael asks Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) for ideas, but Stanley is preoccupied with a crossword puzzle and says he's busy. Michael keeps asking him, and Stanley finally snaps at Michael, and says the titular [...] "Did I stutter?" [...] in a very loud, threatening tone. Michael, who is visibly shaken, ends the meeting. Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) encourages Michael to take disciplinary action against Stanley, and Michael, initially resistant, decides to pretend to fire him to teach him a lesson. Michael first tells everyone in the office that he is not really firing him, and does so in front of all of them. Stanley responds by threatening to sue him and tell corporate of Michael's antics. When Michael tells Stanley that the firing was actually an attempt at teaching him a lesson, Stanley is angered and goes on a rant, yelling and insulting Michael. Michael suddenly barks at him to stop it, and tells everyone to leave the office, making everyone think he is about to berate Stanley. The camera crew sneak back in to film the exchange, where Michael tearfully (much to Stanley's annoyance) but calmly asks Stanley why he picks on him. Stanley states that he simply does not <b>respect</b> <b>him,</b> and when Michael suggests that Stanley does not know him very well he replies [...] "Michael, I've known you for a very long time. And the more I've gotten to know you, the less I've come to respect you." [...] Michael then takes an uncharacteristically professional tone with Stanley, and says that, while he accepts that Stanley does not <b>respect</b> <b>him,</b> he cannot take such a disrespectful tone with him, because he is his boss. Stanley responds by saying, [...] "Fair enough," [...] and the two shake hands.|$|E
500|$|Bal Thackeray refuted the allegations, saying, [...] "Amitabh Bachchan is an open-minded person, he {{has great}} love for Maharashtra, and this is evident on many occasions. The actor has often said that Maharashtra and {{specially}} Mumbai has given him great fame and affection. He has also said that what he is today {{is because of the}} love people have given him. The people of Mumbai have always acknowledged him as an artiste. It was utter foolishness to make these parochial allegations against him. Amitabh is a global superstar. People all over the world <b>respect</b> <b>him.</b> This cannot be forgotten by anyone. Amitabh should ignore these silly accusations and concentrate on his acting". According to some reports, Raj's censure of Amitabh, whom he supposedly admires, stemmed from his disappointment of not being invited to the wedding of Amitabh's son, Abhishek, despite invitations to his estranged uncle Bal and cousin Uddhav.|$|E
500|$|On September 9, {{two days}} before the Iraq {{commanding}} General David Petraeus addressed the Senate, Biden stated that, [...] "I really <b>respect</b> <b>him,</b> and I think he's dead flat wrong [...] ". He criticized the president, arguing, [...] "This president has no plan – how to win and/or how to leave". During the September 11 testimony by the General, Biden stated that the question to be asked to determine progress was [...] "Are we any closer to a lasting political settlement in Iraq at the national level today than we were when the surge began eight months ago?" [...] He answered his own question by stating [...] "In my judgment, I must tell you, based on my experience and my observation here, as well as in-country, the answer to... questions is no." [...] After the testimony concluded, Biden and other Democrats were criticized for their conduct during the deliberations. In the following weeks Biden would continue with these arguments while campaigning.|$|E
