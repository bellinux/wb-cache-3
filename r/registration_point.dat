40|$|Abstract—To correct {{geometric}} distortion {{and reduce}} space and time-varying blur, {{a new approach}} is proposed in this paper capable of restoring a single high-quality image from a given image sequence distorted by atmospheric turbulence. This approach reduces the space and time-varying deblurring problem to a shift invariant one. It first registers each frame to suppress geometric deformation through B-spline based non-rigid registration. Next, a temporal regression process is carried out to produce an image from the registered frames, which {{can be viewed as}} being convolved with a space invariant near-diffraction-limited blur. Finally, a blind deconvolution algorithm is implemented to deblur the fused image, generating a final output. Experiments using real data illustrate that this approach can effectively alleviate blur and distortions, recover details of the scene and significantly improve visual quality.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Computer {{navigation}} {{plays an}} increasingly important role in craniomaxillofacial surgery. The difficulties in computer navigation at the craniomaxillofacial site lie in the accurate transmission of the dataset to the operating room. This study investigates {{the accuracy of the}} dental-splint registration method for the skull, midface, and mandible. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A synthetic human skull model was prepared with landmarks and scanned with cone beam computer tomography (CBCT). Two registration splints fixed the mandible against the viscerocranium in two different positions (closed vs. open). The target registration error was computed in all 278 landmarks spread over the entire skull and mandible in 10 repeated measurements using the VectorVision(2) (BrainLAB Inc., Feldkirchen, Germany) navigation system. RESULTS: If registered in the closed position an average precision of 2. 07 mm with a standard deviation (SD) of 0. 78 mm was computed for all landmarks distributed over the whole skull. Registration in the open position resulted in an average precision of 1. 53 mm (SD= 0. 55 mm). For single landmarks the precision decreases linearly with distance from the reference markers. The longer the three-dimensional distance between the <b>registration</b> <b>points,</b> the more precise the computer navigation is, mainly in the most posterior area of the cranium. CONCLUSION: Our findings in the cranium are comparable with those of other studies. Artificial fixation of the lower jaw via splint seems to introduce no additional error.

In this work, wavelet coefficient maxima obtained from an orthogonal wavelet decomposition using Daubechies filters were utilized to register images in a multi-resolution fashion.

Despite the lack of translation-invariance of these filters, we showed that when using cross-correlation as a feature matching technique, features of size larger than {{twice the size of}} the filters are correctly registered by using the low-frequency subbands of the Daubechies wavelet decomposition. Nevertheless, high-frequency subbands are still sensitive to translation effects. In this work, we are considering a rotation- and translation-invariant representation developed by E.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>registration</b> of multi-view <b>point</b> sets {{is often}} used in surface {{reconstruction}} for complex parts, and many researchers are striving to improve its accuracy and efficiency. A popular algorithm for registration of 3 D point sets is the Iterative Closest Point (ICP). With the increase of overlapping ratios, the convergence accuracy and speed of ICP algorithm improves. In most cases of 3 D scanning systems, the overlapping regions of multi-view point sets often locate at the boundaries. Based on this characteristic, a new method for <b>registration</b> of multi-view <b>point</b> sets with low overlapping ratios is proposed. Firstly, two kinds of sampling strategies are introduced, and {{a great number of}} point pairs are constructed. Through surface classification, curvature and neighborhood curvature matching of point pairs, the overlapping regions are selected. Then a Levenberg-Marquardt ICP (LM-ICP) method is used to search optimal registration parameters with the points in the overlapping regions. Finally, experiments for <b>registration</b> of multi-view <b>point</b> sets are performed, and results show that the method can get good <b>registration</b> accuracy for <b>point</b> sets with low overlapping ratios...|$|R

Used methods for <b>registration</b> of <b>point</b> clouds have required scanned overlap area betweeen point clouds or adequate points for every scan in common coordinate system.

In this study, a method has been explained for <b>registration</b> of <b>point</b> {{clouds in the}} same coordinate system by one image, which covers the scan area of each point clouds. Essentially, the method is performed in two steps. The first step for the process is calculated the exterior orientation (rotation angles and translation components) of each point clouds with respect to image coordinate system, and image and each scan axes is maked parallel for the other. Translation vector is determined by difference of projection center coordinates in each scan coordinate system. Evaluate of accuracy of the method used here is done by beforhand selected control points coordinates. Seen in the procedure, the method can be used for registration of laser scanner data but accuracy of registration of the method has yet sufficiently.

This paper reports a new approach for <b>point</b> clouds <b>registration</b> utilizing reflectance panoramic images.
