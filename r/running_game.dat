5|$|During {{the preseason}} in 2002, Alford injured {{his knee and}} {{required}} arthroscopic surgery. Prior to returning to the lineup, Alford {{was released from the}} team due to new head coach Gary Etcheverry's desire to focus on the <b>running</b> <b>game.</b> He briefly joined the practice squad of the Ottawa Renegades, but later re-signed with the Argonauts to their own practice squad.|$|E
5|$|Hokies {{tailback}} Darren Evans {{ran for a}} school-record of 253yards, and exceeded 100rushing {{yards in}} a game {{for the first time}} in his career. The Hokie defense shut down the Terrapins <b>running</b> <b>game</b> and held them to 12yards on 18carries. Maryland also proved unable or unwilling to blitz against Sean Glennon, the Tech quarterback hobbled by an ankle injury. Glennon threw for 127yards and a touchdown.|$|E

5|$|Stanford's <b>running</b> <b>game</b> was led {{statistically}} by sophomore {{running back}} Stepfan Taylor, who garnered 1,023rushingyards and 15touchdowns {{during the regular}} season. Before the game, Cardinal head coach Jim Harbaugh {{said he planned to}} give three other running backs—Tyler Gaffney, Jeremy Stewart, and Anthony Wilkerson—opportunities to carry the ball when Taylor was taken out of the game.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1928 Florida–Georgia game, Georgia fans trumpeted {{the return}} of center Ike Boland to bolster its defense. Florida's defense, however, {{rendered}} the Georgia Bulldogs' <b>running</b> <b>game,</b> including that of fullback Herdis McCrary, ineffective {{en route to a}} 26–6 victory. This was Florida's first victory over Georgia in seven match-ups and solidified the Gators as legitimate contenders for their first-ever conference title. Two Bulldogs' fumbles, and two Gators pass plays, accounted for Florida's four touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1958 season, O'Connell, who {{lacked the}} stature and {{durability}} Paul Brown wanted in a starter, retired {{to take a}} coaching job in Illinois, and Milt Plum was named as his replacement. Cleveland, however, was relying increasingly on the <b>running</b> <b>game,</b> in contrast to its pass-happy early years under Graham. As the team built up a 9–3 regular-season record, Brown in 1958 ran for 1,527yards – almost {{twice as much as}} any other back and a league record at the time.|$|E

5|$|Despite those players' {{performance}}s, {{the game}} was decided in the <b>running</b> <b>game</b> {{and the performance of}} the two teams' offensive and defensive lines. Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh was praised for adjusting his team's strategy at halftime, allowing it to succeed in the second half. Stanford's rushing offense accounted for 247 yards, while its defensive line limited Virginia Tech to just 67 yards rushing. The Stanford defense also sacked Virginia Tech quarterback Tyrod Taylor eight times, denying him time to pass the ball accurately.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} part of the season, Smith {{increased}} his role and was elevated over Isaiah Williams as the number-two receiver across from Darrius Heyward-Bey. Head coach Ralph Friedgen explained that his presence would alleviate the coverage on Heyward-Bey and praised Smith's blocking ability in the <b>running</b> <b>game.</b> Against Florida State, Smith broke the school record for single-season kickoff return yards, previously held by cornerback Josh Wilson. He had 119all-purpose yards, including one 13-yard reception. Smith posted his season-best performance against 21st-ranked Boston College with 245all-purpose yards and eight receptions for 115yards and a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|Receivers Muhsin Muhammad (60 receptions, 863yards, 5 touchdowns) and Bernard Berrian (51 receptions, 775yards, 7 touchdowns) {{provided}} the main deep threat on the team, along with tight end Desmond Clark, who caught 45 passes for 626yards and 6 touchdowns.

5|$|Clemson's {{offense was}} led by quarterback Woodrow Dantzler, who {{finished}} the regular season having completed 58 percent of his passes for 1,691 yards, 10 touchdowns, and six interceptions. He also ran the ball extremely successfully, gaining 947 yards and 13 touchdowns on the ground. In the <b>running</b> <b>game,</b> Dantzler had the second-most yards on the team. No. 1 was running back Travis Zachery, who ran 201 times for 1,012 yards and 13 touchdowns. Zachery also was one of Dantzler's favorite passing targets. He caught 27 passes for 288 {{yards and four touchdowns}} during the regular season.|$|E

5|$|In {{their fifth}} {{game of the}} 2013 season and their second home game, Alabama {{defeated}} the Georgia State Panthers 45–3. AJ McCarron led a 71-yard drive capped off with an eight-yard touchdown pass to Christion Jones for a 7–0 lead. On their first possession, Georgia State gained one first down but was quickly driven back by Alabama's defense who forced a punt. Alabama's next drive saw it lean more on the <b>running</b> <b>game,</b> and T. J. Yeldon scored on a four-yard touchdown run for a 14–0 Crimson Tide lead. On the kickoff that ensued, Dee Hart forced a fumble that Crimson Tide linebacker Dillon Lee recovered {{and returned to the}} Panthers' 10-yard line. On the next play, McCarron completed a touchdown pass to DeAndrew White that increased Alabama's lead to 21–0.|$|E

5|$|Since 1957, {{there have}} been five Gold Glove batteries. The pitcher and catcher, collectively known as the battery, {{are the only two}} players on the field {{involved}} in every pitch. In particular, the pitcher and catcher control the <b>running</b> <b>game</b> with tools such as pickoffs or the strength of the catcher's throwing arm. The first pitcher and catcher on the same team to win Gold Gloves in the same year were Jim Kaat and Earl Battey, with the Minnesota Twins in 1962. Only two pairs of batterymates have won Gold Gloves together more than once: Iván Rodríguez and Kenny Rogers won with the Texas Rangers in 2000, and again with the Detroit Tigers in 2004 and 2006. Yadier Molina and Adam Wainwright matched the feat, winning in both 2009 and 2013.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's rushing {{offense was}} led by several {{different}} running backs: Mike Imoh, Branden Ore, and Cedric Humes. In 2005, Hokie running back Cedric Humes had accumulated a career-high 134yards and twotouchdowns against North Carolina in the Hokies' final regular-season game. Backup running back Branden Ore ran for 104yards and a touchdown on 17attempts, {{the second time in}} as many games that Humes and Ore ran for 100yards or more in the same game. The Hokies ran 31times in the second half and threw only twopasses. A similar <b>running</b> <b>game</b> was predicted for the ACC Championship Game. Imoh, meanwhile, was limited by an ankle injury suffered {{during the course of the}} season. Heading into the conference championship game, he had rushed for 415yards and threetouchdowns.|$|E

He had 151.5 career sacks and led the Rams in sacks nine times despite playing first in assistant coach Ray Malavasi's stop-the-run-first defensive scheme and then in his final two seasons in defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmer's 3-4 two-gap scheme which limited some pass rush opportunities {{to make sure the}} opponent's <b>running</b> <b>game</b> was handled.

5|$|In the teams' {{first meeting}} since 2010, Penn State visited TCF Bank Stadium {{to face a}} Minnesota team looking for their fourth {{consecutive}} Big Ten victory, and their eighth win of the season, {{which would have been}} their first time since the 2003 season. There was consensus among both Penn State's and Minnesota's SB Nation sites, as well as independent picks, that Minnesota would win a relatively close game. Minnesota's offense was one of the better rushing teams in the conference (20th in the nation), but Penn State's defense was also pretty good against the run, making it a good matchup. Freshman quarterback Christian Hackenberg in tandem with a <b>running</b> <b>game</b> that, in theory, was led by Bill Belton and supplemented by Zach Zwinak, and receivers Allen Robinson had potential to score a lot of points. Keys to the game included avoiding turnovers and running the football. Minnesota head coach Jerry Kill, recovering from seizures stemming from epilepsy, coached from the press box.|$|E
5|$|The 1950s saw {{the rise}} of yet more dynasties and power programs. Oklahoma, under coach Bud Wilkinson, won three {{national}} titles (1950, 1955, 1956) and all ten Big Eight Conference championships in the decade while building a record 47-game winning streak. Woody Hayes led Ohio State to two national titles, in 1954 and 1957, and dominated the Big Ten conference, winning three Big Ten titles—more than any other school. Wilkinson and Hayes, along with Robert Neyland of Tennessee, oversaw {{a revival of the}} <b>running</b> <b>game</b> in the 1950s. Passing numbers dropped from an average of 18.9 attempts in 1951 to 13.6 attempts in 1955, while teams averaged just shy of 50 running plays per game. Nine out of ten Heisman trophy winners in the 1950s were runners. Notre Dame, one of the biggest passing teams of the decade, saw a substantial decline in success; the 1950s were the only decade between 1920 and 1990 when the team did not win at least a share of the national title. Paul Hornung, Notre Dame quarterback, did, however, win the Heisman in 1956, becoming the only player from a losing team ever to do so.|$|E
5|$|The 1987 {{season was}} a {{disappointment}} for the Giants. They lost their first two {{games of the season}} before the 1987 NFL Players Strike. As opposed to the players strike five years previous, NFL owners made a decision to go forward with replacement players. Unlike other teams such as the Washington Redskins and Houston Oilers, who made specific and elaborate plans to deal with the replacement games, the Giants made no plans. This resulted in the Giants losing all three replacement games, putting their record at 0–5 before the strike was over and the regular players returned. Though the Giants went a respectable 6–4 over their final 10 games, they were out of the playoffs at 6–9. A particular disappointment was the <b>running</b> <b>game,</b> which due to injuries to the offensive line (including tackle Karl Nelson missing the entire season due to Hodgkin's disease) struggled all season. Standouts included tight end Mark Bavaro, who led the team in catches with 55, and three of the Giants linebackers making the Pro Bowl—Taylor, Carl Banks (who was voted the team's MVP by the players), and Carson.|$|E
50|$|The 49ers {{were led}} {{by one of the}} best <b>running</b> <b>games</b> in the NFL in 1976. Delvin Williams emerged as an elite back, gaining over 1200 yards rushing and would make the Pro Bowl. Wilbur Jackson also enjoyed a resurgence, rushing for 792 yards. Again Gene Washington was the team's leading {{receiver}} with 457 yards receiving and six scores.|$|R
