5|$|On 23 June, {{the ship}} was present when the Pacific Squadron sortied in an {{abortive}} attempt to reach Vladivostok, but the new squadron commander, Rear Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft, ordered the squadron to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>Port</b> Arthur when it encountered the Japanese battleline shortly before sunset, as he {{did not wish to}} engage his numerically superior opponents in a night battle.|$|E
25|$|The strike group then split. Both Kidd and Preble <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>port</b> on 16 June 2009. John C.

5|$|Another uneventful advance {{into the}} North Sea {{took place on}} 21–22 April. A {{bombardment}} mission followed two days later; Posen joined the battleship support for Hipper's battlecruisers while they attacked Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24–25 April. During this operation, the battlecruiser Seydlitz was damaged by a British mine and had to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>port</b> prematurely. Due to the poor visibility, the operation was soon called off, leaving the British fleet no time to intercept the raiders.|$|E
5|$|Eliza died in childbirth, leaving Low {{with his}} daughter. The {{loss of his}} wife had a {{profound}} effect on Low: in his later career of piracy, he would often express regret for the daughter he left behind, and refused to press-gang married men into joining his crews. He would also allow women to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>port</b> safely. At first working honestly as a rigger, in early 1722 he joined a gang of twelve men on a sloop headed for Honduras, where they planned to collect a shipment of logs for resale in Boston.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of Typhoon Shanshan, the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau issued a marine warning for all {{ships in the}} areas around {{the north and the}} east coasts of the island and in the Bashi Channel. Tourists were also asked to avoid the areas due to fears over large waves. The Zhejiang provincial government in the People's Republic of China also asked all fishermen to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>port</b> and ordered local authorities to help with evacuations of people from areas threatened by the typhoon.|$|E

5|$|Integrity {{set sail}} on 8 June, heading {{south along the}} New South Wales coast. A week later she {{encountered}} heavy storms and winds while passing Cape Howe {{and was unable to}} proceed. Houstoun ordered a <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>Port</b> Jackson, which was regained on 19 June. While in port, one of Integritys crew, a sailor named William Dwyre, was removed from the ship and sent to prison for having refusing to carry out his duties while aboard. There was no sign of Contest and she was presumed lost at sea.|$|E
5|$|The provincial {{observatory}} of Fujian {{issued a}} typhoon warning for the province on July 11, {{well in advance}} of Bilis' final landfall. In response to the warning, officials evacuated over 800,000people from Hunan and 70,000 from Zhejiang. In addition, 256,000 fishermen and workers were evacuated from coastal areas in southeastern China, and 220,000 ships were ordered to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>port.</b> In Shanghai, the evacuations caused significant rail and bus delays, and more than 210 flights {{in and out of the}} city were canceled prior to landfall.|$|E
5|$|Upon Presidents <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>port,</b> the U.S. Navy {{launched}} {{an investigation into}} the incident. Gathering testimony from Presidents officers and crewmen, they determined that Little Belt had fired the first shot in the encounter. In the Royal Navy investigation, Captain Bingham insisted that President had fired the first shot and continued firing for 45 minutes, rather than the five minutes Rodgers claimed. In all subsequent reports, both captains continually insisted that the other ship had fired the first shot. Reaching a stalemate, the American and British governments quietly dropped the matter.|$|E

5|$|By mid-August 1941, Empire Simba, with a {{completely}} new crew, had been repaired enough to set out in a Liverpool – Freetown convoy, but evidently returned to Liverpool the same day. After making her way to Oban on 9 September, she began the first of seven roundtrips to Freetown over the next 18 months, including convoy SL 125. Twice, when setting out with convoys, Empire Simba had to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>port</b> with unspecified problems. In a third convoy sailing, a problem with her steering gear caused her to collide with another convoy ship, Empire Scott, and on 1 August Empire Simba straggled and {{dropped out of the}} convoy.|$|E
5|$|In China, 1,001,000people in Zhejiang and 710,000people in Fujian were {{evacuated}} to shelters prior to Saomai's landfall. Over 20,000 soldiers and police were mobilized {{to aid in}} cleanup and rescue efforts. Officials ordered 10,286ships with 35,282fishermen to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>port</b> in Fujian, while another 5,638ships returned to port in Zhejiang. Also in Fujian, all 26,800schools were closed. The Wenzhou city government ordered all businesses to close and prepare for the storm. Airlines canceled 25flights from Fuzhou Changle International Airport and another 17 from Hong Kong, while ferry service was also disrupted. During the storm, the Wenzhou Longwan International Airport closed, stranding hundreds of travelers.|$|E
5|$|On June16, the Central Weather Bureau issued sea {{and land}} {{warnings}} in Taiwan as Soudelor was anticipated to produce torrential rains, gale-force winds, and rough seas. All fishermen {{in the area}} were urged to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>port</b> {{before the onset of}} the typhoon. As the typhoon tracked near Taiwan, the Japan Meteorological Agency began advising residents in Okinawa to closely monitor the storm. One of the major airlines in Japan, All Nippon Airways, cancelled 66 domestic flights the same day, stranding an estimated 6,000 people. During the storm, 257domestic flights were canceled, and train and ferry service was canceled. In Nagasaki Prefecture, 732schools were closed during the storm. Hundreds of people voluntarily evacuated in Japan.|$|E

5|$|Prior to Xangsane's final landfall, the Vietnamese {{government}} {{set up a}} {{steering committee}} headed by Deputy Prime Minister Nguyễn Sinh Hùng to oversee evacuations and storm preparations throughout central Vietnam. Provincial and local authorities evacuated over 300,000people from low-lying areas along the coast from Hà Tĩnh to Phú Yên, as well as hilly areas prone to landslides. The Vietnamese government also ordered about 2,400 boats, including 273 fishing boats, to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>port.</b> Vietnam Airlines, the national airline, cancelled or diverted all flights on September 30 and October 1. These efforts were carried out {{in order to prevent}} a repeat of the damage and fatalities caused by Typhoon Chanchu earlier in the season.|$|E
5|$|Savary's <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>port</b> {{marked the}} end of the last attempt by a {{continental}} nation to land troops in Ireland. French losses in the operation were so severe that a repeat effort was never seriously contemplated. Similarly, the huge Irish losses during the rebellion, combined with British reprisals against the Irish populace, ended any hopes of reigniting the uprising in the near future. Most serious of all for the United Irishmen was the arrest of Wolfe Tone himself, who was discovered among the prisoners taken from Hoche at Buncrana. Tone was charged with treason and sentenced to death, though he committed suicide in Dublin before the sentence could be carried out.|$|E
5|$|The fleet that Hopkins {{launched}} {{consisted of}} Alfred, Hornet, Wasp, Fly, Andrew Doria, Cabot, Providence, and Columbus. In addition to ships' crews, it carried 200 marines {{under the command}} of Samuel Nicholas. In spite of gale force winds, the fleet remained together for two days, when Fly and Hornet became separated from the fleet. Hornet was forced to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>port</b> for repairs, and Fly eventually caught up with the fleet at Nassau, after the raid took place. Hopkins did not let the apparent loss of the two ships dissuade him; he had intelligence that much of the British fleet was in port due to the high winds.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} torpedoed during the Japanese {{surprise}} attack on Port Arthur {{during the night}} of 8/9 February 1904 and grounded in the harbour entrance when she attempted to take refuge inside, as her draft had significantly deepened from {{the amount of water}} she had taken aboard after the torpedo hit. She was refloated and repaired in time to join the rest of the 1st Pacific Squadron when they attempted to reach Vladivostok through the Japanese blockade on 10 August. The Japanese battle fleet engaged them again in the Battle of the Yellow Sea, forcing most of the Russian ships to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>Port</b> Arthur after their squadron commander was killed and his flagship damaged. Retvizan was sunk by Japanese howitzers in December after the Japanese gained control of the heights around the harbour.|$|E
5|$|Their {{first two}} days at sea are {{unproductive}} and they <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>port</b> each night. On the third day, Hooper wants to bring along a shark proof cage. Initially Quint refuses, considering it a suicidal idea, but he relents when Hooper offers him a hundred dollars. On the ocean, the shark finally shows up. Hooper guesses the animal {{must be at least}} twenty feet long, and is visibly excited and in awe. After several unsuccessful attempts by Quint to harpoon the shark, Hooper goes underwater in the cage. He resolves to first take photos of the shark, before trying to kill it with a bang stick. However, the shark attacks the cage, and, after ramming the bars apart, kills and eats Hooper.|$|E
5|$|After Prussia {{expressed}} an interest in the ship, the Emperor of France, Napoleon III, bought her in April for 2.5 million dollars over the objections of his own navy, which preferred a home-built ship. The exact date of purchase is unknown, but Welles noted in his diary on 7 May that Webb had told him of the sale. On 27 June, Webb refunded the money that had been paid to him and also purchased those items furnished by the government. A little over a week later, he attempted to sail to France, but had to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>port</b> the following day due to engine problems. These were not resolved until 19 July when he, and his entire family, set sail. Dunderberg arrived at Cherbourg on 3 August and the French Navy took possession three days later.|$|E
