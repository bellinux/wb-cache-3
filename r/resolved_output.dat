In this paper we demonstrate absolute long distance measurement using a single femtosecond frequency comb laser as a multi-wavelength source. By applying a high-resolution spectrometer {{based on a}} virtually imaged phased array, the frequency comb modes are resolved spectrally {{to the level of}} an individual mode. Having the frequency comb stabilized against an atomic clock, thousands of accurately known wavelengths are available for interferometry.

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} {{detailed}} analysis of the maximum channel utilization and loss performance in an optical buffer having access to a single outgoing channel. As opposed to a conventional electronic buffer, such a system- consisting of a number of fiber delay lines- can only realize a discrete set of delays to <b>resolve</b> <b>output</b> port contention. This leads to an underutilization of the channel capacity, which reduces overall performance. The framework considered in this paper greatly simplifies the assumptions made in previous work, which allows us to study the impact of a variety of new parameters on the performance, e. g., the burstiness of the arrival process and the correlation of consecutive burst lengths. Moreover, we present exact results for both the channel utilization and loss rate in such a system, this in contrast with all prior work which provided accurate approximations for the loss rate. Matrix analytic methods are used to perform this analysis. To the best of our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that such an approach is used to analyze an optical buffer. We show, amongst others, that carefully choosing the granularity parameter can, in some cases, make a substantial difference when trying to realize lower buffer losses or a high channel utilization. Optimal values of the granularity parameter are shown to be closely related to the optical burst length distribution. I...|$|R

40|$|Two {{techniques}} {{that provide a}} compromise between the high time overhead in maintaining synchronous voting {{and the difficulty of}} combining results in asynchronous voting are proposed. These techniques are specifically suited for real-time applications with a single-source/single-sink structure that need instantaneous error masking.

Both quorum-majority voting (QMV) and compare-majority voting (CMV) are most applicable to distributed real-time systems with single-source/single-sink tasks. All real-time systems eventually have to <b>resolve</b> their <b>outputs</b> into a single action at some stage.

With {{a large number}} of cores, Network-On-Chip (NOC) provides a scalable communication method for CMPs. NOC must be carefully designed to provide low latencies and high throughput in the resource-constrained environment. To improve the network throughput, we propose the Very Long Packet Window (VLPW) architecture for the NOC router design that tries to close the throughput gap between state-of-the-art on-chip routers and the ideal interconnect fabric. To improve throughput, VLPW optimizes Switch Allocation (SA) efficiency. Existing SA normally applies Round-Robin scheduling to arbitrate among the packets targeting the same output port. However, this simple approach suffers from low arbitration efficiency and incurs low network throughput. Instead of relying solely on simple switch scheduling, the VLPW router design globally schedules all the input packets, <b>resolves</b> the <b>output</b> conflicts and achieves high throughput.

ODL has been used in optical packet switches to resolve resource contention; however, the packets travel continuously in ODL limits the management of random access of the packets and increases the packet loss probability.

40|$|It is {{becoming}} increasingly important for applications to protect sensitive data. With current techniques, the programmer bears the burden of ensuring that the application’s behavior adheres to policies about where sensitive values may flow. Unfortunately, privacy policies are difficult to manage because their global nature requires coordinated reasoning and enforcement. To address this problem, we describe a programming model that makes the system responsible for ensuring adherence to privacy policies. The programming model has two components: 1) core programs describing functionality independent of privacy concerns and 2) declarative, decentralized policies controlling how sensitive values are disclosed. Each sensitive value encapsulates multiple views; policies describe which views are allowed based on the output context.

When generating the database, {{the evaluation of}} the associated modeling uncertainties is crucial for retrieval error estimation. However, this is extremely complex due to the large number of free parameters. In this work, a possible methodology for taking into account CRD-related modeling uncertainties is proposed. The methodology—fairly general—is here applied to a limited dataset (a cloud-model <b>resolved</b> numerical <b>output</b> of a tropical cyclone). The modeling errors are obtained from systematic TB sensitivity tests associated to several parameters: particle sizes, temperature, ice content, sea surface wind speed, viewing angle, footprint size, radiative transfer schemes, melting phase, and particle shape.

For comparison with real observations, the TBs are simulated at the spatial resolution, viewing geometry and frequencies of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI). The matrix is evaluated with respect to TMI data in terms of an indicator called database matching index. Since they are based on a single case study and suffer from the lack of direct coupling of the radiative transfer with the cloud-resolving model, the provided results should not be considered an exhaustive evaluation of cloud-radiation modeling errors.
