50|$|The device's {{software}} was also simplified; a Samsung representative stated that 40% {{of the features}} in TouchWiz were removed or streamlined {{in comparison to the}} S5. Additionally, the Galaxy S6's battery is no longer user-replaceable; Samsung had been a major holdout from the trend against <b>removable</b> <b>batteries,</b> but argued that due to the S6's fast AC charging and its support of both major wireless charging standards, it no longer needs to provide the ability for users to remove and replace the battery.|$|R
25|$|The Zen Touch has {{a smaller}} form factor and larger backlit blue display in a curved {{industrial}} design. In addition, the device uses a touch-sensitive vertical strip {{on the front}} of the unit for easier file navigation. These changes were enabled by the use of Hitachi's smaller 1.8-inch hard drives. The Touch is available in capacities of 20 and 40GB. Unlike the previous two generations, the Zen Touch does not have a <b>removable</b> <b>battery,</b> and plays audio for approximately 24 hours. Even though the battery is not removable, it can be replaced rather easily since the case is closed with screws only and the battery attaches with a connector.|$|E

5000|$|The Verge criticized Samsung's overall {{handling}} of the battery faults and recall, arguing {{that the company had}} initially delivered unclear messaging over whether the devices were still safe to use, as well as its slow communication with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, which had the capacity to issue an official recall in the U.S. The arguments were based on data released on 13 September 2016 by the research firm Apteligent, which stated that Galaxy Note 7 usage had been [...] "almost exactly the same" [...] since the announcement of the exchange program. The Verge also noted that the U.S. government's ban on taking Galaxy Note 7 phones aboard airline flights was [...] "perhaps unprecedented", acknowledging that only the ban of hoverboards by individual airlines for similar reasons—an entire class of products (albeit one that was [...] "admittedly fire-prone because of cheap materials")—came close to a legal ban for a single consumer product in terms of overall magnitude. Kyle Weins of Wired.com felt that Samsung switched to non-removable batteries in order to imitate the industrial design of Apple, after having used <b>removable</b> <b>batteries</b> on many of its past models (such as the Galaxy Note 4). He argued that this design decision exacerbated the battery faults of the Note 7, by requiring users to replace the entire phone as opposed to just the battery. He suggested that in the future, Samsung could [...] "lead the pack" [...] by switching back to <b>removable</b> <b>batteries,</b> as with other [...] "responsible" [...] OEMs such as HP Inc. and LG Electronics.|$|R

These models were also sold by Canon, as the Canon D2000 and D6000 respectively, and were the first digital SLRs sold under the Canon name. Kodak used the same electronics package for the DCS 600 series, {{which was based on}} the Nikon F5. The DCS 600 range included the Kodak DCS 620x, a high-sensitivity model with an upgraded indium tin oxide sensor and a cyan-magenta-yellow Bayer filter, which had a then-unique top ISO setting of ISO 6400.|$|R

40|$|Mobile devices like smart phones, tablet {{computers}} and ultraportable laptops are experiencing rapid worldwide market growth and have relatively short lifespans. Recently, embedded (non-removable) batteries were introduced that cannot {{be replaced by}} consumers. This study traces the environmental and social consequences of the introduction of embedded batteries throughout the value chain: from the original equipment manufacturers, to the users of mobile devices, to the repair, refurbishment and end-of-life recycling companies. It shows that the introduction of embedded batteries was mainly technology and design-driven, that original owners are hardly aware of embedded batteries (unless they seek to prolong the life of their phones), that embedded batteries have contributed to a thriving but mostly unauthorized repair and refurbishment market and finally that recyclers have difficulties removing the batteries. From a social and environmental sustainability perspective, reintroducing <b>removable</b> <b>batteries</b> is preferable, but the study shows {{this may not be}} feasible and examines alternative options.

50|$|The Series 2000 was a {{complete}} rework of the Reference and Commande lines of pedals. These were higher quality pedals, with electronic FET switching and dual LED indicators.
