The social benefits were limited in September 1995, tuition fees were introduced, the nominal wages in the public service were to increase from that time on only by 6-15%, which meant in the conditions of an inflation rate of 20% a significant reduction of real wages. In addition to this, the privatization process was accelerated.|$|E
50|$|Fiscal policy {{consists}} {{in managing the}} national Budget and its financing so as to influence economic activity. This entails the expansion or contraction of government expenditures related to specific government programs such as building roads or infrastructure, military expenditures and social welfare programs. It also includes the raising of taxes to finance government expenditures and the raising of debt (Treasuries in the U.S.) {{to bridge the gap}} (Budget deficit) between revenues (tax receipts) and expenditures related to the implementation of government programs.

THE TOPIC OF THIS PAPER is the elementary macroeconomic iden-tity—net savings minus investment equals the current account surplus or deficit. This formula is derived immediately from the circular flow, and it has been invested with a near-magical power to “explain ” why countries find themselves with a surplus or deficit on the trade account. Indeed, it is virtually an article of faith that causation runs from the macro aggregates—savings and investment—to the determination of net exports. When countries such as the United States find themselves mired in an unsustainable external deficit, the advice is always to increase savings, by adopting either <b>restrictive</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> or policies that encourage private savings or penalize consumption. Indeed, much of the recent discussion of global imbalances has centered almost entirely on savings. The static view, associated wit...|$|R

Based on the model, we present simulations to determine the path of public debt given the current expected consolidation.

40|$|Between 1995 and 1997, {{the member}} states of the European Union succeeded in {{reducing}} their government deficits {{from an average of}} 5 to 2 ½ percent of GDP. Economic growth remained sluggish throughout the period, but the recession expected by many as a consequence of <b>restrictive</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> did not occur. This is due to a number of reasons: the favourable development of the world economy constituted the most important factor of growth during the phase of fiscal consolidation. Some countries, which were pursuing particularly restrictive policies, devalued their currencies by a significant margin and were thus able to compensate declining domestic demand through rising exports. Given the substantial drop of the saving ratio, the reduction of household disposable income did not result in a corresponding decline of consumption. The lowering of interest rates in the period of transition to European Monetary Union considerably eased the burden of interest payments on government debt for a number of countries.

The first aim is to evaluate the entity of the said tax shift over the last decade across Euro Area (EA- 17) member countries.

Secondly, among the most widely-debated issues concerning the tax shift, we are going to examine the contrasting short-term impacts on the economy resulting from it, and we shall outline the possible risk that, in the short term, this tax shift may exacerbate the economic slump spreading across the European Union, particularly as an effect of the general adoption of <b>restrictive</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> by almost all member countries...|$|R
40|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Greek crisis has revived {{the literature on the}} sovereign debt spreads. Recent evidence has shed new lights on the main determinants of interest rates spreads. The sharp increase of government bond yields cannot be entirely attributed to changes in macroeconomic fundamentals. Contagion effects can occur and self-fulfilling speculation may arise. Yet, this literature has been mainly empirical and needs sound theoretical foundations. The aim {{of this paper is to}} fill in this gap. We develop a simple model in the spirit of second generation currency crises models developed by (Obstfled, 1996). The model describes a strategic game between governments and financial markets. Eurozone countries face a trade-off as governments may either commit and implement <b>restrictive</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> or default on debt. The cost of the commitment strategy increases when interest rates increase or when the fiscal multipliers are high. This leaves the opportunity for speculators to drive the economy towards a bad equilibrium, forcing the government to renege its commitment. We introduce a source of uncertainty about the cost of default in the model. By this way, we may introduce the possibility that governments do not default although risk premiums on bond yield is high...|$|R

Recent empirical evidence has shown that the sharp increase in government bond yields cannot be attributed entirely to changes in macroeconomic fundamentals.

In this paper, we develop a theoretical model {{in the spirit of the}} second-generation currency crisis models developed by Obstfled (1996).

Euro area countries face a trade-off as governments may either commit to and implement <b>restrictive</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> or default on debt. The commitment strategy may not be optimal if the fundamentals deteriorate. The policy maker lose part of their credibility, and governments are forced to default. In addition, we introduce uncertainty about the cost of default in the model, which is then able to account for a greater variety of equilibrium. Thus, when the evaluation of the cost of default is asymmetric, prophecies are not always realized and default does not occur. Simulations of the model then show that it offers insights, and can help to account for the situations of Greece and Italy during the sovereign debt crisis...|$|R
