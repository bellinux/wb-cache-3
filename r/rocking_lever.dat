5000|$|Once {{the stroke}} had begun, the cataract's <b>rocking</b> <b>lever</b> was pushed {{downwards}} by the engine. This lifted the plunger, which {{acted as a}} suction pump within the cataract to refill the plunger box, through a flap valve from its surrounding cistern. The cistern was kept filled with water by the pump that the engine itself was working.|$|E
5000|$|The Gresley {{conjugated}} gear {{is effectively}} an adding machine, where {{the position of}} the valve for the inside cylinder is the sum of the positions of the two outside cylinders, but reversed in direction.

50|$|Delettrez entered {{again in}} 1950, as did another diesel car, the MAP. Again, both cars did not finish due to engine problems, a cooling system leak {{in the case}} of the MAP. The MAP was {{interesting}} in that it was the first mid-engined car to race at Le Mans; the engine was located immediately behind the driver, and was a four-cylinder opposed piston two-stroke with <b>rocking</b> <b>levers</b> connected to a single crank, similar to the later Commer TS3 engine.|$|R
2500|$|Two magnetos were {{mounted on}} the outside of each {{cylinder}} bank. [...] Each magneto fired all eight cylinders for that bank, driven by bevel gear from the vertical shaft that also drove the bank's single overhead camshaft. [...] Each cylinder had two vertical inlet valves and a single vertical exhaust valve, all driven by <b>rocking</b> <b>levers</b> from the camshaft. [...] Four carburettors each fed four cylinders via a water jacketed manifold. Each cylinder exhausted into an individual pipe in the space between the cylinder blocks. The whole construction was protected by patents until 1935.|$|R
50|$|The main {{connecting}} rod {{is a large}} triangular frame, driven by both cylinders and driving the crankpin. Owing to the phase difference between the cylinders, this frame tilts {{back and forth as}} the engine rotates and so the cylinder crossheads drive it through two short {{connecting rod}}s, allowing for some movement side-to-side. A large <b>rocking</b> <b>lever</b> attached to the engine's frame holds the connecting rod roughly central. On the Bolton engine, this lever is extended past the frame and used to drive the condenser air pump.|$|E
5000|$|Rifles {{come with}} various safeties. Some use a cross-bolt safety button, others a wing safety at the rear, {{or even a}} [...] "half-cock" [...] notch (such as found on older lever-action rifles.) The Winchester Model 94 {{originally}} utilized a [...] "half-cock" [...] notch safety but the design was revised in 1983 due to numerous inadvertent discharges. The M1 Garand created a safety with a metal <b>rocking</b> <b>lever</b> {{at the front of}} the trigger guard that is now called the Garand-style safety, used in the Ruger Mini-14 rifle and Marlin Camp Carbine.|$|E
50|$|The {{cataract}} itself {{resembled a}} small plunger pump. It was an iron box in a cistern filled with water, with a plunger or piston {{set in the}} top and pressed downwards by a weight. The water within the pump could only escape through a small tap or valve. As the plunger gradually fell, its motion was passed upwards by a <b>rocking</b> <b>lever</b> and a rod to the valvegear in the middle chamber. Once the rod had risen sufficiently, this opened the first valve to admit steam into {{the upper part of}} the cylinder, beginning a new stroke.|$|E
5000|$|Ettore Bugatti {{designed}} several multi-valve aircraft engines. The 1916 Bugatti U-16 1484.3 cid (24.32 L) SOHC 16-cylinder, {{consisting of}} two parallel 8-cylinder banks, offered 410 bhp (305 kW) at 2,000 rpm (12.5 kW/liter or 0.28 bhp/cid). Each cylinder had two vertical inlet valves and a single vertical exhaust valve, all driven by <b>rocking</b> <b>levers</b> from the camshaft. Other advanced World War I aircraft engines, such as the 1916 Maybach Mb.IVa that produced [...] at altitude and the 1916 Benz Bz.IV with aluminium pistons and the 1918 Napier Lion (a 450 bhp 24-liter DOHC 12-cylinder), used two intake valves and two exhaust valves.|$|R
50|$|A {{bevel gear}} at the {{junction}} drove a vertical shaft from which the single overhead camshaft and dual magnetos for each bank were driven.

50|$|Haydock Foundry {{produced}} six 0-6-0 well tank steam locomotives, {{designed by}} Josiah Evans, for the collieries. They had outside Gooch valve gear and piston valves, {{a very early}} use of piston valves. They were named Amazon (built 1868), Hercules (1869), Makerfield (1874), Bellerophon (1874), Parr (1886) and Golborne (1887). Bellerophon is preserved at the Foxfield Railway. The locomotives were broadly similar but had some detail differences. The first two had valves driven by <b>rocking</b> <b>levers.</b> The last four had direct drive to the valves. Working pressure was initially 120 psi but was later raised to 140 psi and then 160 psi. There is some uncertainty about the dates on which the higher pressures were applied. Josiah Evans died in 1873 and Smallwood attributes the design changes to his assistant, James Forrest.|$|R
50|$|The {{most unusual}} {{feature is the}} {{combined}} wind-on and shutter release lever. It swings out forward 65 degrees and is operated by the index finger. In the stowed-away position, the shutter is cocked and the film wound on {{ready for the next}} picture. A small <b>rocking</b> <b>lever</b> in front of the accessory shoe serves as a shutter-release lock at this stage, it is disengaged by sliding it to the left-hand side. Depressing the lever releases the shutter and it relocates to the 65 degrees standoff position. Depressing the lever again cocks the shutter and winds on the film. At the camera base is a special flash sync connector protected by coin-operated O-ring sealed aluminium plug, as well as an automatic resetting frame counter, visible behind a glass window. No tripod socket is provided. A small rewind knob at the left-hand top is extended for easy access and to engage the film transport mechanism. No rewind release facility is required; a function that was later added to the Nikonos and marked R on the shutter-speed dial.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine was}} {{designed}} and built by the roads master mechanic, Andrew Jackson [...] "A.J" [...] Stevens at Sacramento Locomotive Works in 1882. The locomotive had two highly unusual features: the firebox shape and the steam distribution. [...] The rear end of the firebox was depressed so that the outer shell was below the water level, leaving no clear steam space. The roof was sloped down towards the back so that steam bubbles would flow forward till they reached the upper vertical part of the backplate which was in two pieces. The fire-hole door was in the lower backplate. The firebox was very long, [...] to the tubeplate, the grate being [...] long. It {{is not clear what}} object Stevens had in mind when having this abnormal construction, which must have been costly to build and maintain: it did give more room in the cab.The special valve gear operated four slide valves for each cylinder, two of which were worked by Stephenson valve gear, but used for reversing only, and two more, on top of the first two, for controlling the cutoff, these being operated by a third eccentric through a <b>rocking</b> <b>lever</b> with a sliding block on one arm. The use of a double valve gear is reminiscent of Centipede, but separate valves for each end of the cylinder were novel on a locomotive. This valve gear gave very good steam distribution even at short cut-offs; short as understood for a saturated-steam engine with a boiler pressure low by modern standards. At long cut-off and a speed of [...] the indicated mean effective pressure was , which is over 91 per cent of the boiler pressure of , that is to say more than the 85 per cent normally used to calculate the tractive effort at starting. [...] The only other locomotives to use such a valve gear were the 20 copies of Mastodon (see below) and CPR #237 El Gobernador. All other steam locomotives with slide valves had just a single valve in the center.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{prototype}} {{was completed}} at the Swindon Works of the GWR (Lot 132) in February 1902. It was numbered 100 and in June 1902 was named Dean (later William Dean) {{to mark the}} latter's retirement. The new design incorporated all of Churchward's current ideas including a domeless parallel boiler, raised Belpaire firebox, 19 in diameter outside cylinders with 30 in piston stroke, and boiler pressure of [...] The piston valves were driven by <b>rocking</b> <b>levers</b> actuated by the expansion link of Stephenson valve gear - this particular design was only used on no. 100. The parallel boiler was later replaced with a taper boiler, and then the first superheated taper boiler in 1910. Churchward had studied American boiler design, {{but he was also}} later influenced by continental practice in efficient motion design. From the Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques (SACM) a de Glehn 4-4-2 compound engine was ordered for comparative trials on the GWR. According to E.C. Poultney, No. 100 was the first 4-6-0 locomotive to have high enough boiler capacity and steam ports large enough to handle the steam flow required by large cylinders: [...] "The engine probably influenced to a large extent the use made of engines of the 4-6-0 type". No.100 was renumbered 2900 in 1912, and was withdrawn from service in 1932.|$|R
50|$|Unlike Nikon {{magazine}} backs, the Alpa {{ones were}} designed to allow for an entire 100-foot roll of 35 mm film to be inserted at once, and {{to allow for the}} operator to open the takeup side individually to cut off a portion of the film in a changing bag for processing without unloading the rest of the roll. The motor drive resembled some oil pumps in that the motor <b>rocked</b> a <b>lever</b> back and forth to shoot the normal trigger, after a second gear moved the normal shutter cocking mechanism. In actual use, photos can be shot at approximately 1 second intervals.|$|R

50|$|In 1855, John Ramsbottom, later {{locomotive}} {{superintendent of}} the LNWR, described {{a new form of}} safety valve intended to improve reliability and especially to be tamper-resistant. A pair of plug valves were used, held down by a common spring-loaded lever between them with a single central spring. This lever was characteristically extended rearwards, often reaching into the cab on early locomotives. Rather than discouraging the use of the spring lever by the fireman, Ramsbottom's valve encouraged this. <b>Rocking</b> the <b>lever</b> freed up the valves alternately and checked that neither was sticking in its seat. Even if the fireman held the lever down and increased the force on the rear valve, there was a corresponding reduction of force on the forward valve.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{another reason}} that the Logan Rock of Treen is remembered {{is that it was}} the center of a famous drama. In April 1824, Lieutenant Hugh Goldsmith, R. N.

50|$|As {{the brake}} linings wear, the shoes must travel a greater {{distance}} {{to reach the}} drum. When the distance reaches a certain point, a self-adjusting mechanism automatically reacts by adjusting the rest position of the shoes {{so that they are}} closer to the drum. Here, the adjusting <b>lever</b> <b>rocks</b> enough to advance the adjuster gear by one tooth. The adjuster has threads on it, like a bolt, so that it unscrews a little bit when it turns, lengthening to fill in the gap. When the brake shoes wear a little more, the adjuster can advance again, so it always keeps the shoes close to the drum. Typically the adjusters only operate when the vehicle is going in reverse and the brakes are engaged.|$|R
5000|$|Kidston Lake [...] is a {{lake in the}} Spryfield area of Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia, Canada. An area {{along its}} eastern shore has been made into a {{municipal}} park, with artificial sand beaches and a lifeguard in the summer months. It is a popular swimming destination and offers a good swim from the beach to two rock formations called Breadloaf and the Whale's Back. There are trails all around the lake, and going to Leblin Park and other places such as the Greystone and Green Acres subdivisions. The granite barrens south of the lake are an excellent place to find blueberries, which foxes and porcupines share with the more adventurous of the local children. The most famous portion of the park is the Rocking Stone, a 90+ ton glacial erratic boulder which can still be <b>rocked</b> with a <b>lever,</b> but which used to move quite easily, before a band of sailors from the nearby Halifax garrison rocked it into a more stable configuration in the 1890s, and before its base was worn down by excessive rocking in the 1980s and 90s when the park was first developed. A lesser known but equally interesting large glacially-deposited granite monolith called Table Rock, can be found NW of the narrow passage at {{the northern end of}} the lake, where it empties into a boggy area: it is a flat, approximately 30 ton rock firmly balanced upon three rocks, the smallest of which {{is about the size of}} a volleyball.|$|R
