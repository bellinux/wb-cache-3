This form of universality is certainly welcome: individual maps in different animals, from different species (with different developmental scenarii) necessarily have different spectra, but general organizing principles can be enough to explain even quantitative observed properties.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{effectiveness}} of a participatory institutional development approach for better primary schooling in Bangladesh. We conduct a qualitative investigation and find that, despite some limitations, the two key instruments of the participatory approach, school catchment area mapping and school planning, are highly effective in achieving enhanced primary school enrollment, higher retention, reduced dropout and overall better learning. These participatory school management approaches employ social capital by involving communities to attain better learning achievement. Since basic primary education significantly contributes to human capital accumulation in Bangladesh, we argue that our findings <b>reinforce</b> <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis</b> that social capital fosters human capital.
