40|$|Although the spleen {{is a major}} {{site where}} immune {{tolerance}} to circulating innocuous antigens occurs, the kidney also contributes. Circulating antigens smaller than albumin are constitutively filtered and concentrated in the kidney and reach the <b>renal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> by lymphatic drainage, where resident dendritic cells (DCs) capture them and induce tolerance of specific cytotoxic T cells through unknown mechanisms. Here, {{we found that the}} coinhibitory cell surface receptor programmed death 1 (PD- 1) on cytotoxic T cells mediates to their tolerance. <b>Renal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> DCs of the CD 8 (+) XCR 1 (+) subset, which depend on the transcription factor Batf 3, expressed the PD- 1 cognate ligand PD-L 1. Batf 3 -dependent DCs in the <b>renal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> presented antigen that had been concentrated in the kidney and used PD-L 1 to induce apoptosis of cytotoxic T cells. In contrast, T cell tolerance in the spleen was independent of PD- 1, PD-L 1, and Batf 3. In summary, these results clarify how the kidney/renal lymph node system tolerizes the immune system against circulating innocuous antigens...|$|E
40|$|The {{lymphatic system}} plays an {{important}} role in both tissue homeostasis and inflammation. During the surgical procedure there is complete disruption of lymphatic drainage of the allograft kidney. The time course and nature of lymphatic reconnection following transplantation is poorly understood. In addition to the extra-renal lymphangiogenesis required for lymphatic reconnection, some patients may develop de novo lymphatic vessels within the renal parenchyma during acute rejection or chronic allograft damage. This work sought to examine the time course and mechanism of lymphangiogenesis and the role of macrophages in this process. Injection of carbon black and Evan’s blue into the rat kidney resulted in rapid transit to the draining hilar <b>renal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> Surgical disruption of the lymphatic drainage of the kidney prevented trafficking of carbon black to the <b>renal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> at 24 hours. At day 6 there was macroscopic and microscopic evidence of carbon black localisation in the <b>renal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> suggesting functional reconnection. Careful histological analysis of hilar renal tissue indicated that the large lymphatic trunks were replaced by a network of small proliferating lymphatic vessels. Assessment of intra-renal lymphangiogenesis was undertaken in 2 distinct experimental models of renal transplantation. In a murine model of acute allograft rejection there was no evidence of increased lymphatic vessel number at day 7. In a collaboration with Sheffield University, tissue from a rat model of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy was examined. The rat tissue exhibited a prominent macrophage and T-cell infiltration at 12 months but there was no difference in the number of perivascular lymphatic vessels. In contrast, there were numerous lymphatic vessels evident in the interstitium that were absent in control isograft tissue. Interestingly, the number of lymphatic vessels correlated with the extent of fibrosis. Analysis of vascular endothelial cell growth factor-C (VEGF-C) mRNA expression did not show any increase in allografts. The model of unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO) was employed as a model of rapidly progressive inflammatory fibrosis. UUO was associated with rapid and prominent interstitial lymphangiogenesis. This was associated with a marked increase in macrophage and T-lymphocyte infiltration and increased whole kidney mRNA expression of VEGF-C. The role of macrophages in lymphangiogenesis was explored by administration of macrophage depleting liposomal clodronate. No effect upon lymphangiogenesis was found but liposomal clodronate failed to deplete ED- 1 positive macrophages in the kidney. A macrophage isolation strategy was thus employed using the myeloid CD 11 b marker cells and flow cytometric cell sorting and immunomagnetic bead sorting. Although gene expression studies demonstrated increased ED 1 mRNA expression by CD 11 b enriched cells, no difference in VEGF-C mRNA expression between CD 11 b cells obtained from obstructed kidneys versus cells from sham controls was evident. Lastly, despite extensive efforts, immunostaining for VEGF-C was unsuccessful. In summary, lymphangiogenesis can reconstitute the lymphatic drainage of the kidney and is prominent in both chronic allograft injury and the acutely obstructed kidney in the rat. Although VEGF-C is the likely driver of lymphangiogenesis direct evidence of macrophage VEGF-C production was not found...|$|E

40|$|Approximately 30 years ago, {{researchers}} reported intracellular bacteria in filarial nematodes. These bacteria are {{relatives of the}} arthropod symbiont Wolbachia and occur in many filarial nematodes, including Brugia pahangi and Brugia malayi. Wolbachia bacteria have been implicated {{in a variety of}} roles, including filaria development and fecundity and the pathogenesis of lymphatic lesions associated with filarial infections. However, the role of the bacteria in worm biology or filarial disease is still not clear. The present experiments support previous data showing that tetracycline eliminates or reduces Wolbachia bacteria in B. pahangi in vivo. The elimination of Wolbachia was closely linked to a reduction in female fecundity and the viability of both sexes, suggesting that the killing of Wolbachia is detrimental to B. pahangi. The gerbils treated with tetracycline showed reduced levels of interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) and IL- 5 mRNA in <b>renal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and spleens compared with the levels in B. pahangi-infected gerbils not treated with tetracycline. However, similar findings were noted in B. pahangi-infected gerbils treated with ivermectin, suggesting that the loss of circulating microfilariae, not the reduction of Wolbachia bacteria, was associated with the altered cytokine profile. Despite the change in T-cell cytokines, {{there was no difference in}} the sizes of <b>renal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> isolated from gerbils in each treatment group.

Concentric membranous cytoplasmic inclusions were seen in the neurons of {{the central nervous system}} by electron microscopy. There was no sphingomyelinase in the brain tissue. Sphingomyelin and cholesterol were increased in brain, kidney and liver. A diagnosis of Niemann-Pick Disease was based on absence of sphingomye-linase activity, as well as on histologic, histochemical and chemical findings. Niemann-Pick Disease is the result of an autosomal recessive genetic mutation [3, 4, 221 and consequent absence of sphingomyelinase [4, 131, which leads to accumu-lation of sphingomyelin and cholesterol in the central nervous and reticuloendothelial systems.

40|$|Immunosuppressive drugs {{successfully}} prevent {{rejection of}} islet allografts {{in the treatment}} of type I diabetes. However, the drugs also suppress systemic immunity increasing the risk of opportunistic infection and cancer development in allograft recipients. In this study, we investigated a new treatment for autoimmune diabetes using naturally immune privileged, hair follicle derived, autologous cells to provide localized immune protection of islet allotransplants. Islets from Balb/c mouse donors were cotransplanted with syngeneic hair follicle dermal sheath cup cells (DSCC, group 1) or fibroblasts (FB, group 2) under the kidney capsule of immune-competent, streptozotocin induced, diabetic C 57 BL/ 6 recipients. Group 1 allografts survived significantly longer than group 2 (32. 2 ± 12. 2 versus 14. 1 ± 3. 3 days, P< 0. 001) without administration of any systemic immunosuppressive agents. DSCC reduced T cell activation in the <b>renal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> prevented graft infiltrates, modulated inflammatory chemokine and cytokine profiles, and preserved better beta cell function in the islet allografts, but no systemic immunosuppression was observed. In summary, DSCC prolong islet allograft survival without systemic immunosuppression by local modulation of alloimmune responses, enhancing of beta cell survival, and promoting of graft revascularization. This novel finding demonstrates the capacity of easily accessible hair follicle cells to be used as local immunosuppression agents in islet transplantation...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{dendritic}} cells (DC) that {{accumulate in}} the renal parenchyma of non–immune-mediated proteinuric nephropathies {{is not well}} understood. Under certain circumstances, DC capture immunologically ignored antigens, including self-antigens, and present them within MHC class I, initiating an autoimmune response. We studied whether DC could generate antigenic peptides from the self-protein albumin. Exposure of rat proximal tubular cells to autologous albumin resulted in its proteolytic cleavage to form an N-terminal 24 –amino acid peptide (ALB 1 - 24). This peptide was further processed by the DC proteasome into antigenic peptides that had binding motifs for MHC class I and were capable of activating syngeneic CD 8 + T cells. In vivo, the rat five-sixths nephrectomy model allowed the localization and activation of renal DC. Accumulation of DC in the renal parenchyma peaked 1 wk after surgery and decreased at 4 wk, concomitant with their appearance in the <b>renal</b> draining <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> DC from <b>renal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> loaded with ALB 1 - 24, activated syngeneic CD 8 + T cells in primary culture.

40|$|Abstract. The lymphatic {{inflammatory}} response in Brugia-infected jirds peaks early during primary infections and then decreases in severity as {{judged by the}} numbers of lymph thrombi present within these vessels. Antigen-specific hypersensitivity reactions in these animals was measured by a pulmonary granulomatous inflammatory re-sponse (PGRN) induced by somatic adult worm antigen (SAWA) –coated beads, and by cellular proliferative responses of <b>renal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> cells. The kinetics of these responses temporally correspond to lymphatic lesion formation. The importance of any single antigen to the induction of this {{inflammatory response}} has not been elucidated. In this study, the PGRN {{was used to measure}} the cellular immune response to four recombinant filarial proteins {{during the course of a}} primary B. pahangi infection. These proteins were BpL 4, glycoprotein (glutathione peroxidase) gp 29, heat shock protein (hsp) 70, and filarial chitinase. All were fusion proteins of maltose-binding protein (MBP). Control beads included those coated with diethanolamine (DEA), SAWA, or MBP. The measurements of PRGN were made at 14, 28, 56, and. 150 days postinfection (PI) in infected jirds, in jirds sensitized with SAWA, and in uninfected jirds. The secretory homolog of glutathione peroxidase gp 29 was the only recombinant protein tested that induced a sig-nificantly greater PGRN (P, 0. 05) than controls. This was seen at 28 days PI. These observations indicate that gp 29 may be part of the worm antigen complex that induces an early inflammatory response, a response similar to that observed with SAWA.

MethodsRenal DCs were studied by flow cytometric analysis of collagenase-digested mouse kidneys, by immunohistochemistry, and by immunofluorescence microscopy. In vivo ingestion by DCs of intravenously administered fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -dextran particles was examined. A model antigen system (presentation of ovalbumin-derived peptide to TCR transgenic CD 4 + T-cells) was employed to examine the influence of systemic (lipopolysacchride injection) and localized (unilateral renal artery clipping) renal injury on DC-mediated T-cell activation in the renal lymph nodes (RLNs). ResultsRenal DCs were shown to constitute the predominant source of T-cell stimulatory capacity within the kidney, and to avidly ingest both filtered and nonfiltered particles. Lipopolysaccharide resulted in disappearance of DCs from the renal interstitium within 48 hours. This was accompanied by increased <b>renal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> DCs, some of which contained intracellular Tamm-Horsfall Protein, indicating abnormal trafficking of kidney-specific antigens following renal injury. Lipopolysaccharide enhanced DC-mediated proliferation of ovalbumin-specific CD 4 +ve T-cells within the draining RLN. Unilateral renal ischemia augmented the capacity for DC-mediated T-cell activation in the lymph nodes draining both the ischemic and nonischemic kidney. ConclusionRenal DCs respond to systemic or localized acute renal injury by increasing the traffic of protein antigens from kidney to RLN, resulting in a concomitant increased potential for localized activation of antigen-specific CD 4 +ve T-cells...|$|E
40|$|Islet {{transplantation}} {{provides a}} "cure" for {{type 1 diabetes}} but is limited in part by recurrent autoimmunity mediated by β cell-specific CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cells. Insight into the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of effector T cells driving recurrent autoimmunity would aid the development of immunotherapies to prevent islet graft rejection. Accordingly, we used a multi-parameter flow cytometry strategy to assess the TCR variable β (Vβ) chain repertoires of T cell subsets involved in autoimmune-mediated rejection of islet grafts in diabetic NOD mouse recipients. Naïve CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cells exhibited a diverse TCR repertoire, which was similar in all tissues examined in NOD recipients including the pancreas and islet grafts. On the other hand, the effector/memory CD 8 (+) T cell repertoire in the islet graft was dominated by one to four TCR Vβ chains, and specific TCR Vβ chain usage varied from recipient to recipient. Similarly, islet graft- infiltrating effector/memory CD 4 (+) T cells expressed {{a limited number of}} prevalent TCR Vβ chains, although generally TCR repertoire diversity was increased compared to effector/memory CD 8 (+) T cells. Strikingly, the majority of NOD recipients showed an increase in TCR Vβ 12 -bearing effector/memory CD 4 (+) T cells in the islet graft, most of which were proliferating, indicating clonal expansion. Importantly, TCR Vβ usage by effector/memory CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cells infiltrating the islet graft exhibited greater similarity to the repertoire found in the pancreas as opposed to the draining <b>renal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> pancreatic lymph node, or spleen. Together these results demonstrate that effector/memory CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cells mediating autoimmune rejection of islet grafts are characterized by restricted TCR Vβ chain usage, and are similar to T cells that drive destruction of the endogenous islets...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Oncolytic viruses, {{including}} {{vaccinia virus}} (VACV), are a promising alternative to classical mono-cancer treatment {{methods such as}} surgery, chemo- or radiotherapy. However, combined therapeutic modalities {{may be more effective}} than mono-therapies. In this study, we enhanced the effectiveness of oncolytic virotherapy by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP- 9) -mediated degradation of proteins of the tumoral extracellular matrix (ECM), leading to increased viral distribution within the tumors. Methods For this study, the oncolytic vaccinia virus GLV- 1 h 255, containing the mmp- 9 gene, was constructed and used to treat PC- 3 tumor-bearing mice, achieving an intra-tumoral over-expression of MMP- 9. The intra-tumoral MMP- 9 content was quantified by immunohistochemistry in tumor sections. Therapeutic efficacy of GLV- 1 h 255 was evaluated by monitoring tumor growth kinetics and intra-tumoral virus titers. Microenvironmental changes mediated by the intra-tumoral MMP- 9 over-expression were investigated by microscopic quantification of the collagen IV content, the blood vessel density (BVD) and the analysis of lymph node metastasis formation. Results GLV- 1 h 255 -treatment of PC- 3 tumors led to a significant over-expression of intra-tumoral MMP- 9, accompanied by a marked decrease in collagen IV content in infected tumor areas, when compared to GLV- 1 h 68 -infected tumor areas. This led to considerably elevated virus titers in GLV- 1 h 255 infected tumors, and to enhanced tumor regression. The analysis of the BVD, as well as the lumbar and <b>renal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> volumes, revealed lower BVD and significantly smaller lymph nodes in both GLV- 1 h 68 - and GLV- 1 h 255 - injected mice compared to those injected with PBS, indicating that MMP- 9 over-expression does not alter the metastasis-reducing effect of oncolytic VACV. Conclusions Taken together, these results indicate that a GLV- 1 h 255 -mediated intra-tumoral over-expression of MMP- 9 leads to a degradation of collagen IV, facilitating intra-tumoral viral dissemination, and resulting in accelerated tumor regression. We propose that approaches which enhance the oncolytic effect by increasing the intra-tumoral viral load, may be an effective way to improve therapeutic outcome. </p...|$|E

The Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) pathway modulates the balance of T cell subsets in the peripheral circulation as well as multiple inflammatory responses, suggesting that FasL may mediate ischemic AKI. Here, we induced bilateral renal IRI in mice bearing a loss-of-function mutation of FasL (the gld mutation) and in wild-type mice. Compared with wild-type mice, serum creatinine was lower in gld mice (1. 4 ± 0. 9 mg/dl versus 2. 6 ± 0. 4) at 24 hours after IRI (P < 0. 05). In addition, gld mice had fewer TNF-α-producing T lymphocytes in the kidneys and <b>renal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Furthermore, pharmacologic blockade of FasL protected the kidneys of wild-type mice from IRI.

40|$|The {{progression}} of kidney disease to renal failure correlates with infiltration of mononuclear immune cells into the tubulointerstitium. These infiltrates contain macrophages, DCs, and T cells, but {{the role of}} each cell type in disease progression is unclear. To investigate the underlying immune mechanisms, we generated transgenic mice that selectively expressed the model antigens ovalbumin and hen egg lysozyme in glomerular podocytes (NOH mice). Coinjection of ovalbumin-specific transgenic CD 8 + CTLs and CD 4 + Th cells into NOH mice resulted in periglomerular mononuclear infiltrates and inflammation of parietal epithelial cells, similar to lesions frequently observed in human chronic glomerulonephritis. Repetitive T cell injections aggravated infiltration and caused progression to structural and functional kidney damage after 4 weeks. Mechanistic analysis revealed that DCs in <b>renal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> constitutively cross-presented ovalbumin and activated CTLs. These CTLs released further ovalbumin for CTL activation in the <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and for simultaneous presentation to Th cells by distinct DC subsets residing in the kidney tubulointerstitium.

Our objectives were to analyse characteristics and therapeutic options of LR after RN {{and to identify}} survival prognostic factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From a multi-institutional retrospective database, we identified 72 patients who experienced LR after RN. RESULTS: Mean time to LR was 26. 5 [*]±[*] 3. 3 months. The location of the recurrence was <b>renal</b> fossa, regional <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> homolateral adrenal and both renal fossa and regional <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> for 43 (59. 7...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBecause of the {{increasing}} trend of body contour enhancements with injections, implants, and fillers, clinicians should be on high alert {{for the possibility of}} silicone-induced hypercalcemia as one of the differential diagnoses in a patient with history of silicone use. Hypercalcemia as a result of silicone injections has been reported, and there is concern that there will be more cases given the popularity of cosmetic silicone. Cases involved a mother and daughter (70 & 55 years) who presented in 2013 with hypercalcemia after cosmetic silicone injections in 2007. Evaluation showed 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D-mediated hypercalcemia and progressive <b>renal</b> dysfunction; <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> biopsy showed granulomatous silicone lymphadenitis. MRI of the pelvis revealed abnormal signal enhancement within the subcutaneous gluteal adipose tissue and enlarged inguinal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> For persistent hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria, surgical resection of silicone material and granulomas is a successful approach to normalize the serum calcium level...|$|R
40|$|A 59 -year-old {{man who had}} {{undergone}} hemodialysis for 13 years was diagnosed with left renal cell carcinoma (RCC), cT 1 aN 0 M 0, in 2010. He had a laparoscopic left nephrectomy, and the pathological diagnosis {{at that time was}} clear cell carcinoma, pT 1 a (multifocal). At 1 year after surgery, he was diagnosed with a left <b>renal</b> hilar <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis and a new right RCC, cT 1 aN 0 M 0. Consequently, he underwent a right nephrectomy and retroperitoneal <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection in 2012. Pathologic diagnosis by the current classification of the right renal tumor was acquired cystic disease-associated renal cell carcinoma (ACD-associated RCC), and that of the left hilar <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> was metastatic RCC with sarcomatoid change. According to the revised classification the pathological diagnosis of the left renal tumor was ACD-associated RCC. There has been no evidence of recurrence or metastasis for 3 years after the second operation. The specific classification of dialysis-related renal tumors and their characteristics should be standard knowledge for urologists...|$|R
2500|$|Contrast-enhanced {{computed}} tomography (CT) scanning is routinely {{used to determine}} the stage of the renal cell carcinoma in the abdominal and pelvic regions. CT scans have the potential to distinguish solid masses from cystic masses and may provide information on the localization, stage or spread of the cancer to other organs of the patient. Key parts of the human body which are examined for metastatic involvement of renal cell carcinoma may include the <b>renal</b> vein, <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and the involvement of the inferior vena cava. [...] According to a study conducted by Sauk et al., multidetector CT imaging characteristics have applications in diagnosing patients with clear renal cell carcinoma by depicting the differences of these cells at the cytogenic level.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Explore aorta B cell {{immunity}} in aged ApoE-/- mice. Approach and Results: Transcript maps, FACS, immunofluorescence analyses, cell transfers, and Ig-ELISPOT assays showed multi-layered atherosclerosis B cell {{responses in}} artery tertiary lymphoid organs (ATLOs). Aging-associated aorta B cell-related transcriptomes {{were identified and}} transcript atlases revealed highly territorialized B cell responses in ATLOs versus atherosclerotic lesions: ATLOs showed upregulation of bona fide B cell genes including Cd 19, Ms 4 a 1 (Cd 20), Cd 79 a/b, and Ighm though intima plaques preferentially expressed molecules involved in non-B effector responses towards B cell-derived mediators, i. e. Fcgr 3 (Cd 16), Fcer 1 g (Cd 23), and the C 1 q family. ATLOs promoted B cell recruitment. ATLO B- 2 B cells included naïve, transitional, follicular, germinal center, switched IgG 1 +, IgA+, and IgE+ memory cells, plasmablasts, and long-lived plasma cells (PCs). ATLOs recruited large numbers of B- 1 cells whose subtypes were skewed towards IL- 10 + B- 1 b cells versus IL- 10 - B- 1 a cells. ATLO B- 1 cells and PCs constitutively produced IgM and IgG and a fraction of PCs expressed IL- 10. Moreover, ApoE-/- mice showed increased germinal center B cells in <b>renal</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> IgM-producing PCs in the bone marrow, and higher IgM and anti-MDA-LDL IgG serum titers. Conclusions: ATLOs orchestrate dichotomic, territorialized, and multi-layered B cell responses in the diseased aorta; germinal center reactions indicate generation of autoimmune B cells within the diseased arterial wall during aging...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction: The angiomyolipoma (AML) is {{constituted}} by adipose tissue, {{blood vessels and}} smooth muscle fiber; follows a benign clinical course, with slow growth and absence of metastasis, occurring in tuberous sclerosis or sporadically. Objective: We intend to describe the clinical, radiological and histological aspects of this tumor. Case report: A- 64 -year-old woman presented with abdominal pain and dyspepsia. Tomography showed hepatic, renal and mesenteric nodules. Histological evaluation of mesenteric <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> revealed perivascular epithelioid differentiation neoplasia, compatible with AML/perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa), positive for anti-S 100, anti-human melanoma black- 45 (HMB- 45) and anti-smooth muscle actin. Conclusion: We described a rare AML with <b>renal,</b> hepatic and <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> involvement, representing a multicenter version instead of metastasis...|$|R
40|$|Computed tomographic (CT) -guided biopsies of the lesions in paraaortic {{region were}} {{performed}} for three urologic disease conditions: retroperitoneal fibrosis, <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastases of transitional cell carcinoma of <b>renal</b> pelvis and <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis of <b>renal</b> cell carcinoma. The biopsies were performed without complications using the Bard Biopty biopsy gun with a Bard Biopty-Cut needle. Every biopsy specimen we {{obtained by the}} Biopty rendered an excellent biopsy core from which a definite histopathological diagnosis was made. CT-guided biopsy {{is considered to be}} safe and useful for diagnosis of the disease of the paraaortic region, even when ultrasonography guided biopsy is difficult. The use of the Biopty for CT-guided biopsy provides a high quality specimen for histopathological diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|To gain {{further insight}} into the {{pathogenesis}} of African swine fever (ASF), the cytokine expression by macrophages in spleen and <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were examined. Twenty-one piglets were inoculated with the highly virulent isolate Spain- 70 of ASF virus and killed in groups at 1 - 7 post-inoculation days (pid). An increase in the immunohistochemical detection of proinflammatory monokines in spleen and <b>renal</b> and gastrohepatic <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> is reported, along {{with an increase in}} the serum levels of TNF-alpha and IL- 1 beta. The expression of these cytokines is detected simultaneously in time and space with the viral protein 73 (vp 73) of the ASF virus detection. Our results demonstrate that mononuclear phagocyte system cell activation results in the release of several cytokines that could induce apoptosis of lymphocytes and haemodynamic changes...|$|R
40|$|Wilms tumor. The {{perioperative}} {{finding was}} a large renal mass with intact <b>renal</b> capsule and <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> enlargement at the hilum. The distal pancreas was also resected suspecting infiltration. On gross examination, the tumor occupied most of the kidney except the upper pole. The tumor measured 8 × 8 × 7 cm. The cut surface showed multiple cystic and solid areas with intervening hemorrhage and necrosis. The renal capsule was intact, and the hilum was free of tumor. The leftover renal parenchyma was normal on gross examination. Microscopic examination showed a well-circumscribed tumor having glandular, papillary, and reticular patterns of arrangement of cells (Fig. 1). Tumor cells were moderately pleomorphic, with...|$|R
40|$|The kidney {{contains}} receptors for the cytokine IL- 25, but {{the effects}} of IL- 25 in CKD are unknown. Here, we induced adriamycin nephropathy in both BALB/c mice and severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, and we injected IL- 25 for 7 consecutive days starting at day 5 after adriamycin administration. BALB/c mice treated with IL- 25 had less glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy, interstitial expansion, and proteinuria than control mice at day 28. IL- 25 increased the levels of IL- 4 and IL- 13 in serum, kidney, <b>renal</b> draining <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> and CD 4 + lymphocytes. IL- 25 also directly suppressed effector macrophages in vitro and in vivo and induced alternatively activated (M 2) macrophages in vivo. However, in SCID mice and in BALB/c mice treated with IL- 4 / 13 –neutralizing antibody, IL- 25 failed to protect against renal injury and did not induce M 2. In conclusion, IL- 25 protects against renal injury in adriamycin nephropathy in mice by, at least in part, inducing Th 2 immune responses...|$|R
