40|$|Background Job {{rotation}} {{might be}} an effective preventive measure to reduce the prevalence of musculoskeletal complaints, although its effect has not been yet established. The aim {{of the present study}} is to evaluate the effect of job rotation in refuse collecting on need for recovery, prevalence of musculoskeletal complaints, and sick leave due to musculoskeletal complaints. Methods A 1 -year prospective study among <b>refuse</b> <b>collectors</b> was performed, using standardized questionnaires. Job rotation was performed between collecting two-wheeled containers and driving a refuse truck. The experimental groups of rotating <b>refuse</b> <b>collectors</b> at t(0) and t(1) (group R-R) and non-rotating <b>refuse</b> <b>collectors</b> at to and rotating <b>refuse</b> <b>collectors</b> at t(1) (group NR-R) were compared with a reference group of non-rotating <b>refuse</b> <b>collectors</b> at t(0) and t(1) (group NR-NR). Results The adjusted need for recovery of group R-R was marginally significantly lower than need for recovery of the reference group. Groups R-R and NR-R had a more than two times higher risk for complaints of the low back than the reference group. No other significant results were found. Conclusions Job rotation seemed to coincide with a reduced need for recovery and was associated with an increased risk of low back complaints. No effects were found on sick leave due to musculoskeletal complaints. The results might be influenced by the healthy worker selection effect in the reference group and its inverse in the rotating groups. Â© 2005 Wiley-Liss, In...|$|R

40|$|City {{officials}} from Haarlem, a Dutch {{city in which}} one of the first scientific studies on the workload of <b>refuse</b> <b>collectors</b> was performed, wanted to compare the work situation and physical workload in 1997 with the results of a study performed in Haarlem in 1985 and with the results of a national study conducted in 1993. Depending on the results, they wanted to implement effective preventive measures. The present study consisted of a field study, a simulation experiment in the laboratory, and a questionnaire concerning work characteristics and health effects among 18 <b>refuse</b> <b>collectors.</b> The work situation and the energetic workload were not more favourable in Haarlem in 1997 compared to Haarlem of 1985 or the national study conducted in 1993. On several important parameters, such as the time carrying plastic bags or pushing containers, amount of refuse collected and percentage VO(2 max) during a working day, the results in the present study did not differ from those in earlier studies. However, the working postures and the perceived exertion of the <b>refuse</b> <b>collectors</b> in Haarlem in 1997 were more favourable when compared to the <b>refuse</b> <b>collectors</b> in the national study. The results have convinced the management to plan an intervention study of potentially effective measures to improve the work situation and to reduce the physical workload. Planned measures are the introduction of job rotation, an effective work-rest schedule and the redesign of two-wheeled containers. Relevance to industry. This study shows that a comparison of the work situation and physical workload with former studies is an effective way {{to address the issue of}} preventive measures.

40|$|The binlifts of <b>refuse</b> <b>collectors</b> have {{a problem}} with binlift {{oscillations}} when the binlift is lowered slowly. The problem escalates with hot oil that has lower viscosity. Most problematic the oscillations are with an accessory scale on the binlift as it does not tolerate oscillations in the position where it takes measurements. These oscillations are caused by load control valves and wrong directional control valve spools make these oscillations worse. To figure out possible solutions for the oscillations the thesis has comprehensive load control valve theory part which summarizes all the traditional and latest inventions related to load control valves. This information is used in selecting valves for measurements. In this thesis there are measurements with different load control valves, directional control valve spools, restrictors, hoses and sequence valves. Measurements are done with a rear loader and they include flow and pressure measuring. These measurements are done to figure out which combination is the best compromise between energy consumption, oscillations and cost. This compromise should also fill all standardization requirements. Several solutions are found that are not ideal, one solution which is recommended and a couple of which are recommended in case oscillations are still needed to be degreased. Future solutions are also discussed but they require many changes to the hydraulic fundamentals of the <b>refuse</b> <b>collectors.</b> These solutions are likely to be possible for the coming generations of <b>refuse</b> <b>collectors...</b>|$|R

Smooth starting was obtained by fitting a centrifugal clutch and two stage control, using a switch and resistance. Transition between the stages was controlled by an automatic hydraulic dashpot, and helical gearing and a differential in the rear axle ensured that the vehicle was very manoeuvrable. The 24-volt battery, manufactured by Kathanode, gave it a range of 10 to 12 mi with a full load.

40|$|Service workers {{like social}} workers are {{valuable}} to society (LeCroy and Stinson, 2004), even noble and heroic (Ashforth et al., 2007), yet, perversely, they are often socially stigmatized, seen as 'dirty' by their communities because they deal with 'tainted' people (Ashforth and Kreiner, 1999). Other service workers also suffer stigmatization because their role is associated with effluent (e. g., <b>refuse</b> <b>collector),</b> they have a servile relationship with others (e. g., housekeeper), or adopt tasks that are perceived as amoral (e. g., pawnbroker) or intrusive (e. g., telemarketer). We propose that feelings of stigma lead to poor well-being and present a conceptual model which introduces the concept of 'stigmatized labour' {{as a type of}} role stress. We postulate that excessive stigmatized labour (the cognitive and behavioural practices adopted by service workers to protect themselves from feelings of stigma) leads to burnout as service workers' limited resources are exhausted to deal with the stress (Hobfoll, 2001) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} job {{rotation}} {{on the physical}} workload was investigated for male employees working at a refuse collecting department. Before the introduction of job rotation, an employee worked as a street sweeper, as a <b>refuse</b> <b>collector</b> or as a driver. After the introduction of job rotation, every employee was allowed to alternate {{between two of the}} three possible jobs during the day, i. e. refuse collecting/street sweeping, refuse collecting/driving or street sweeping/driving. Two non-rotation groups (i. e. refuse collectors and street sweepers) and two rotation groups (i. e. refuse collectors/street sweepers and street sweepers/drivers) were mutually compared. The physical workload was determined by measuring the perceived load, energetic load and postural load during a full working day. Job rotation resulted in a significant decrease of the perceived load and energetic load and a slight decrease of the postural load. The results indicate that the total amount of work performed by means of job rotation resulted in an overall reduced physical workload of the employees of the refuse collecting departmen...|$|E
40|$|In Tanzania, the {{health-related}} {{underpinnings of}} solid waste management {{still need to be}} addressed. Even the minimal regulatory framework which exists in this country for environmental protection and occupational health and safety is not fully enforced. Waste collection is by labor intensive systems with little, if any, worker protection from direct contact to injuries, respiratory problems and related factors. This study had the aims of exploring occurrence of injuries, respiratory problems and other related factors among <b>refuse</b> <b>collectors</b> and none <b>refuse</b> <b>collectors.</b> The cross-sectional study was carried out where l 35 refuse handlers and 113 other workers were involved. Questionnaire was used to collect data on injuries; respiratory problems and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Data were analyzed using SPSS version 15. 0 computer program. Generally, prevalence of injuries and respiratory problems were higher among <b>refuse</b> <b>collectors</b> than in other workers. The proportion of exposure that has faced injuries was 47. 4 % while for other workers was 25. 5 %, the difference was statistically significance between the groups (P=O. OOOI). The group from refuse handlers had higher prevalence of acute respiratory problems such as dry cough (OR) = 5. 95, 95 %, (CI= 3. 25, 10. 88), flue OR= 4. 90, 95 %, (CI= 2. 77, 8. 67) and nasal irritation OR = 4. 64, 95 %, (CI= 1. 58, 8. 28) while controlling for age and smoking status. With regard to chronic respiratory symptoms for refuse handlers and other workers there were not significantly different. On the use of PPE most respondents know that PPE are important but they don't use because they are not provided which means not available. Regarding hazard prevention measures there were provided for only 20 % of facilities studied. From the study findings it is concluded that refuse handlers are highly affected by injuries and acute respiratory symptoms compared to other workers. Moreover there was less use of personal protective equipment among them. In addition the facilities do not provide adequate safety measures. This implies need to enforce laws and regulations to safeguard the health of workers that will involve the right to be training and of being examine periodically on their health problems...|$|R
