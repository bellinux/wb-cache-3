5000|$|The {{engine of}} the 996 GT3 set it apart {{from most of the}} other Porsche 996 models, {{although}} it shared the same basic design of the standard so-called [...] "integrated dry sump" [...] flat-six engine. The engine is naturally aspirated and based on the unit used in the Porsche 962 and Porsche 911 GT1 race cars. That engine was known as the 'Mezger' engine, after its designer Hans Mezger. The engine uses the original air-cooled 911's versatile dry-sump crankcase, with an external oil reservoir. The 996 GT3 has , compared to the [...] of the regular Porsche 996. In GT3 configuration, this so-called [...] "split" [...] crankcase (meaning the parting line of crankcase is on the crankshaft centreline) uses, instead of a fan and finned cylinders, separate water jackets added onto each side of the crankcase to <b>cool</b> <b>banks</b> of three cylinders with water pumped through a radiator. Thus, the GT3 engine is very similar to the completely water-cooled Porsche 962 racing car's engine, which is based on the same crankcase. The 962 differs, however, by using six individual cylinder heads while the GT1/GT3, like the air and water-cooled Porsche 959, uses two cylinder heads, each covering a bank of three cylinders. The GT3 engine could thus also be thought of as similar to a 959 engine, but with water-cooled cylinders. Up to early model year 2004 996 GT3 production, the basic casting used for the crankcase of the GT3 was the same as the air-cooled engine. The [...] "964" [...] casting number was visible {{on the bottom of the}} crankcase, and on areas normally machined in air-cooled applications, but not in water-cooled ones. The crankcase casting was changed in mid-2004 to a [...] "996" [...] casting number crankcase to eliminate these external air-cooled remnants, but internally it was the same.|$|R

40|$|The {{relentless}} {{pursuit of}} Moore’s Law by {{the semiconductor industry}} has yielded significant increases in performance, but {{at the cost of}} greater power dissipation. As CMOS technology continues to scale, increasing power densities, or “hot spots,” particularly in dense logic structures, may limit frequencies below projected targets in order to avoid circuit malfunction. A solution to this problem is to separate the hot spots by interleaving these units with <b>cooler</b> cache <b>banks.</b> This approach, however, increases the distance among processing functions, which can significantly degrade performance. While effort is made to localize communication as much as possible, global communication cannot be completely avoided, particularly in parallel applications. In this paper, the use of silicon-based on-chip optical interconnects is investigated for minimizing the performance gap created by separating processing functions due to thermal constraints. Models of optical components are presented, and used to connect the common front-end with the distributed back-ends of a large-scale Clustered Multi-Threaded (CMT) processor.

50|$|There are {{a number}} of lizards ranging in size from just over an inch or two in length to the huge 6 ft long green iguana (Iguana iguana). The {{so-called}} luminous lizard (Riama shrevei) makes its home in primary lower montane and montane forest at the mouths of caves and <b>cool</b> stream <b>banks</b> on the high peaks, ridges and high valleys of the Northern Range of Trinidad and is found nowhere else on earth. Found in forest, forest edge and savanna habitats, the large tegu (Tupinambis teguixin) or matte/salipenta as it is locally called and the green iguana (still fairly common, even in some sub-urban areas) are considered delicacies on both Trinidad and Tobago. A number of anole species (Anolis) may be easily observed, even in suburban areas. Only Anolis chrysolepis is a Trinidad native, with all other anoles being relatively recently or historically introduced. Other common lizards include macro-teiids (or whip-tailed lizards) such as the Ameiva atrigularis (locally called the zandolie or ground lizard and common even in suburban gardens) and Cnemidophorus lemniscatus (most readily seen along some coastal areas of southwestern Tobago and on Trinidad's east and south coasts and on the islands of Chacachacare, Huevos, Little Tobago and Goat Island). Nocturnally active geckos of the genera Thecadactylus and Hemidactylus are common in old and rural buildings on both islands and are commonly referred to as mabouias and wood slaves respectively. There {{are a number}} of small colourful diurnal geckos of the genus Gonatodes present. One of them, Gonatodes ocellatus is endemic to forests and edge habitats of northeastern Tobago while another, Gonatodes vittatus or the streak lizard as it is locally known, is very common and can be seen in most suburban and even urban backyards in Trinidad (and is probably relatively recently introduced to some parts Tobago associated with human occupation). The tiny Mole's gecko Sphaerodactylus molei is found on both islands and is among the smallest of lizards in the world.|$|R
40|$|Quenching {{of heated}} {{surfaces}} through impinging liquid jets {{is of great}} im-portance for numerous applications like steel processing, nuclear power plants, automobile industries, etc. Therefore, computational modelling of the surface quenching through circular water jets impinging normally onto a heated flat surface has vital importance in order to reveal the physics of the quenching process. At first, a numerical model was developed for single jet impingement process. A conjugate heat transfer problem was solved implying consideration of both regions, one occupied by fluid (multi-phase flow consisting of water, vapor and ambient air) and one accommodating the solid surface within the same solution domain. Numerical simulations were performed {{in a range of}} relevant operating param-eters: jet velocities (2. 5, 5, 7. 5 and 10 m/s), water sub-cooling (75 K) and wall-superheat (650 K - 800 K) corresponding closely to those encountered in the industrial water jet <b>cooling</b> <b>banks.</b> Due to the high initial temperature of the surface, the boiling process exhibits strong spatial and temporal fluctuations. Its effect on the boundary layer profiles at the stagnation region at different time intervals are analyzed. The analysis reveals a highly distorted field of both mean flow and turbulence quantities. It represents an im-portant outcome, also with respect to appropriate model improvements. The different boiling characteristics are envisaged in detail to increase the level of understanding of the phenomena. The influence of the turbulent kinetic energy investigated at the boiling front as well as the jet-acceleration region has been studied. The physically relevant results are obtained and analyzed along with reference database provided experimentally by Karwa (2012, ‘Experimental Study of Water Jet Impingement Cooling of Hot Steel Plates,' Dissertation, FG TTD, TU Darmstadt). The intensive quenching process is consistent with the high rate of sub-cooling and high jet velocities. The surface temperature predicted by quenching model within the impingement region and the subsequent wall-jet region agrees reasonably well with the measurements, the outcome being particularly valid at higher jet velocities. However, a steep temperature gradient at the position corresponding to boiling threshold has not been captured under the condition of the numerical grid adopted. On the other hand, a reasonably good prediction of the wetting front propagation phenomena advocates the future development of the model. The high-intensity back motion of the vapor phase in the stagnation region at the earlier times of the water jet impingement can induce an appropriately high turbulence level, which could be accounted well by the turbulence model applied. The second part of the present work deals with multiple liquid jet impingement. When the multiple jets impact onto the heated surface, the heat flux is extracted from the surface by the mass flow rate. The heat flux is dependent on the several flow conditions and configurations of the nozzle array system. Therefore, one needs to study the nozzle array configuration along with several flow parameters for the better design of the cooling header system. Accordingly, the hydrodynamics of the multiple jets has been studied computationally realizing the need for optimum configuration of the nozzle array. The effects of the mass flow rate, target plate width and the turbulence produced due to the impingement were studied. Afterward, an analytical model is proposed for the quenching of the multiple jets system. It has been realized that, when jet impinges onto the surface at very high initial temperature, the film boiling {{may play a role in}} the heat transfer mechanism. Therefore, development has been made in the film-boiling model considering the effect of turbulence at the liquid jet stagnation region at the Leidenfrost point. The Leidenfrost point is the minimum temperature at which the film boiling can sustain. However, the vapor-liquid interface has the dynamic character; it oscillates with high frequency and causes the additional momentum diffusivity. Therefore, the need for introducing the effect of associated turbulence has been felt. The length and velocity scale of the turbulent structure has been approximated by assuming homogeneous turbulence. The new model for the heat flux and wall superheat yielded results agreeing well with published experimental results...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to assess how, and to what extent do {{managerial}} and technology changes affect electricity consumption, associated costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of dairy farms. The impact of future electricity price tariffs on dairy farm energy costs was quantified and the efficacy of adjusting milking time to mitigate peak electricity prices was explored. A dairy farm electricity and economic model was applied to assess the potency of technology investment strategies to improve farm profitability and deliver a return on capital invested. The results of this study showed that the most efficacious technology investment strategy to increase farm profitability consisted of a direct expansion milk cooling system with pre-cooling of milk to 15 °C with well-water prior to entry to the milk storage tank and heating water with an electrical water heating system. An individual farmer can also choose to minimise electricity use, related costs and GHG emissions, with the trade-off of reduced profitability by adding a solar thermal water heating system. Or indeed minimise electricity costs, with the trade-off of reduced performance in the areas of farm profitability, electricity use and associated GHG emissions by choosing an ice <b>bank</b> <b>cooling</b> system.

40|$|Thermophysiological {{traits of}} two {{isolated}} Hoplodactylus maculatus populations were investigated to test adpatations to climate. Geckos {{were collected from}} Craigieburn (high altitude, generally <b>cooler</b> site) and <b>Banks</b> Peninsula. If climatic conditions at respective sites influenced physiology, I expected geckos from Craigieburn to exhibit cold-adapted physiological traits, whilst Banks Peninsula geckos would exhibit traits more characteristic of a warmclimate species. To this end I investigated four thermophysiological parameters: metabolism (SMR), preferred body temperature (PBT), locomotory performance and critical thermal minimum (CTMin). I hypothesized that if climate {{had an effect on}} SMR, Craigieburn geckos would exhibit higher levels of SMR which typically characterise other coolclimate reptiles. Craigieburn geckos displayed an average relative elevation of SMR over Banks Peninsula geckos of 26 %. Furthermore, Craigieburn geckos appeared to be 'geared' towards lower body temperatures and exhibited a greater acclimatory and acclimatizatory ability of SMR. The PBT of Craigieburn geckos was consistently elevated above Banks Peninsula geckos. This finding was somewhat paradoxical in light of previous studies of this parameter. A closer examination of the ecology of the two populations is required to clarify the adaptive significance of a higher PBT in geckos from a cooler climate. With respect to locomotory performance, I hypothesized that if thermal extremes influenced activity, Craigieburn geckos would exhibit activity patterns which help ameliorate the adverse effects of cold temperature. Craigieburn geckos did in fact have greater independence of activity to temperature than Banks Peninsula geckos, especially over lower body temperatures. The final parameter investigated, that of the critical thermal minimum, failed to distinguish the populations decisively. However there was some evidence of a greater acclimatizatory and acclimatory range in Craigieburn geckos, providing somewhat limited support for a population difference. Investigations into all four parameters lead me to conclude that populations of Hoplodactylus maculatus from Craigieburn and Banks Peninsula are physiologically distinct and warrant a revision of nomenclature...|$|R
40|$|As {{the living}} {{standards}} of Chinese {{people have been}} improving, the energy demand for cooling and heating, mainly {{in the form of}} electricity, has also expanded. Since an integrated cooling, heating and power supply system (CCHP) will serve this demand better, the government is now attaching more importance to the application of CCHP energy systems. Based on the characteristics of the combined cooling heating and power supply system, and the method of levelized cost of energy, two calculation methods for the evaluation of the economical efficiency of the system are employed when the energy production in the system is dealt with from the perspective of exergy. According to the first method, fuel costs account for about 75 % of the total cost. In the second method, the profits from heating and cooling are converted to fuel costs, resulting in a significant reduction of fuel costs, accounting for 60 % of the total cost. Then the heating and cooling parameters of gas turbine exhaust, heat recovery boiler, lithium-bromide heat-cooler and commercial tariff of provincial capitals were set as benchmark based on geographic differences among provinces, and the economical efficiency of combined cooling heating and power systems in each province were evaluated. The results shows that the combined cooling heating and power system is economical in the developed areas of central and eastern China, especially in Hubei and Zhejiang provinces, while in other regions it is not. The sensitivity analysis was also made on related influencing factors of fuel cost, demand intensity in heating and <b>cooling</b> energy, and <b>bank</b> loans ratio. The analysis shows that the levelized cost of energy of combined cooling heating and power systems is very sensitive to exergy consumption and fuel costs.

Finally, some suggestions were offered {{from the perspective of the}} power grid, gas sector reform, heating and cooling systems and other aspects to promote the use of combined cooling heating and power systems in the future...|$|R
