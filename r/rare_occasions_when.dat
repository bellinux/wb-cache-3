25|$|Since World War II Maltese {{political}} culture has {{developed into a}} two-party system dominated by the Labour Party and the Nationalist Party. Although other political parties have presented candidates and, in some cases, elected MPs, in most cases these were splinter groups of the main parties and, on the <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> <b>when</b> they were successful, this success was short-lived.|$|E

25|$|Mount Binuluan {{is usually}} covered in cloud or mist and so {{photographs}} could {{be difficult to}} obtain. The village of Bangtitan in Upper Uma in Lubuagan is a good vantage point for views and photography of the mountain on the <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> <b>when</b> the primary peak is not mist-enshrouded. It is not known if Binuluan itself has ever been climbed as access to the site is very difficult. The terrain is rugged and undeveloped.|$|E
25|$|On Mars, only partial solar eclipses (transits) are possible, {{because neither}} of its moons is large enough, at their {{respective}} orbital radii, {{to cover the}} Sun's disc {{as seen from the}} surface of the planet. Eclipses of the moons by Mars are not only possible, but commonplace, with hundreds occurring each Earth year. There are also <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> <b>when</b> Deimos is eclipsed by Phobos. Martian eclipses have been photographed from both the surface of Mars and from orbit.|$|E
25|$|The Church does {{recognize}} that there are <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> <b>when</b> it is better that couples do separate, but there is no official recognition of civil divorces. For the Orthodox, to say that marriage is indissoluble means that it should not be broken, the violation of such a union, perceived as holy, being an offense resulting from either adultery or the prolonged absence of one of the partners. Thus, permitting remarriage is an act of compassion of the Church towards sinful man.|$|E
5000|$|The final between Clara and O'Loughlin Gaels {{presented}} a <b>rare</b> <b>occasion</b> <b>when</b> {{a set of}} brothers lined out on opposing teams.

During {{the course of the}} game the two brothers marked each other.|$|R
50|$|When {{the tunnel}} is open, the lake's {{turbidity}} increases. The sudden influx of the Adige's water, {{which is both}} appreciably colder and more polluted than the lake's, causes a considerable heat shock and significantly worsens the habitat for fish.For these reasons the tunnel is used only on the <b>rare</b> <b>occasion</b> <b>when</b> there is a flood risk in the Veronese basin.|$|R

25|$|Flyer was {{faster than}} Indianapolis. Although {{steamboat}} races were by then officially forbidden by company officials, Flyers crews were continually challenging their counterparts to a race. Finally on 28 July 1910, the superior {{speed of the}} Flyer was firmly established, at least to her partisans, when {{on one of the}} <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> <b>when</b> the two vessels left the Seattle dock at the same time, Flyer beat Indian to Tacoma, unloading her passengers and departing for the fuel dock before the Indian had arrived.|$|E
25|$|On the Royalist side, the {{campaign}} of 1645 opened in the west, where Charles II, the young prince of Wales was sent with Hyde (later, Earl of Clarendon), Hopton, and others as his advisers. General (Lord) Goring, however, now {{in command of the}} Royalist field forces in this quarter, was truculent, insubordinate and dissolute. On the <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> <b>when</b> he did his duty, however, he did display a certain degree of skill and leadership, and the influence of the prince's counsellors was but small.|$|E
25|$|The New York parade {{is moved}} to the {{previous}} Saturday (16 March) in years where 17 March is a Sunday. The event also has been moved on the <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> <b>when,</b> due to Easter's falling on a very early date, 17 March would land in Holy Week. This same scenario arose again in 2008, when Easter fell on 23 March, but the festivities occurred on their normal date and were enjoyed by {{a record number of}} viewers. In many other American cities (such as Philadelphia), the parade is always held on the Sunday before 17 March, regardless of the liturgical calendar.|$|E

5000|$|By {{this point}} Hopkins {{was one of}} Britain's best-known session players, {{particularly}} through his work with the Rolling Stones and after playing electric piano on the Beatles' [...] "Revolution" [...] - a <b>rare</b> <b>occasion</b> <b>when</b> an outside rock musician appeared on a Beatles recording. Further raising his profile, he contributed to several Harry Nilsson albums in the early 1970s, including Nilsson Schmilsson and Son of Schmilsson, and recordings by Donovan.|$|R
50|$|Karl is {{a middle-aged}} man that looks after Spot and lets him stay in his aquarium. Karl usually acts as the {{straight}} man for Spot's and Buddy's antics, knowing the flaws in the frogs' thoughts, but willing to play along with them anyway. Even on the <b>rare</b> <b>occasion</b> <b>when</b> he does question one of their ideas, he does so with a smirk and a raised eyebrow, more interested in their response than anything else.|$|R
25|$|The Surfer's {{board is}} {{composed}} of a nearly impervious, cosmically powered silvery material {{that is similar to}} his own skin. The board is mentally linked to the Surfer and moves in response to his mental commands even when he is not in physical contact with it. The board is nearly indestructible, but on those <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> <b>when</b> it has been damaged or destroyed, the Surfer has proven able to repair it, or even recreate it, with little effort. The Surfer can attack opponents remotely by directing the board against them, and the board is capable of absorbing and imprisoning other beings, at least temporarily.|$|E
25|$|The {{caterpillars}} {{are considered}} a problem when the larva population explodes in the spring. They can completely consume the foliage of a tree. Trees usually recover from this, refoliating within a month and resuming photosynthesis. Under most circumstances, little lasting damage is caused to the trees; however, the disappearance of foliage {{is considered to be}} an unattractive nuisance. On those <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> <b>when</b> infestations last for three years or more, tree mortality rates can become significant. Multiple outbreaks in Northern Ontario, Canada, in the 1990s resulted in over six consecutive years of aspen defoliation in some areas. One outbreak in upstate New York and Vermont began in 2002, with 650,000 acres (2600km²) defoliated in New York and 230,000 acres (930km²) in Vermont by 2005.|$|E
25|$|Eastern gray {{squirrels}} have a {{high enough}} tolerance for humans to inhabit residential neighborhoods and raid bird feeders for millet, corn, and sunflower seeds. Some people who feed and watch birds for entertainment also intentionally feed seeds and nuts to the squirrels for the same reason. The squirrels also raid gardens for tomatoes, corn, strawberries, and other garden crops. Sometimes they eat the tomato seeds and discard the rest. On very <b>rare</b> <b>occasions,</b> <b>when</b> their usual food sources are scarce, eastern gray squirrels also prey upon insects, frogs, small rodents including other squirrels, and small birds, their eggs, and young. They also gnaw on bones, antlers, and turtle shells – likely {{as a source of}} minerals scarce in their normal diet.|$|E

50|$|Vajra-musti matches {{are still}} held during the annual Mysore Dasara festival, a {{tradition}} {{dating back to}} the Wadiyar dynasty in 1610. Unlike the bloody matches of old, modern combatants use knuckle-dusters with blunt studs. The fight ends immediately after first blood is drawn, and the referee's verdict is seldom questioned. On the <b>rare</b> <b>occasion</b> <b>when</b> the decision is disputed, the loser or his guru can appeal to the judges panel. The umpire and the judges are normally former wrestlers with decades of experience.|$|R

25|$|During {{this period}} Torquay also {{encountered}} political developments. In 1926, the former Liberal MP for Chertsey Francis John Marnham served a one-year term as Mayor of Torquay; {{it was one}} of the <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> <b>when</b> the Town Council selected a chief magistrate from outside its own members. A few years later, Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists attempted to move into the region following great success in the city of Plymouth where the Union had upwards of 1,500 members in 1933, and Mosley spoke to packed meetings in Plymouth's Guildhall and the Drill Hall in Millbay to great acclaim. However, the Torquay branch of the Fascists never took off to the same extent and at its peak in 1933 only had 34 members. By 1935 it had been absorbed back into the Plymouth branch.|$|E
25|$|In February 1958, Brel's wife Miche {{and their}} two {{children}} returned to live in Belgium, while Brel rented a room near Place de Clichy in Paris—a place to stay on those <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> <b>when</b> he was not touring. In March and April, he recorded his third album, Au Printemps (In the spring), which would be released later that year. In May, while touring Canada for the first time, he met Félix Leclerc. On 23 August, his third daughter, Isabelle, was born back in Belgium. In November he gave a recital at the Halles d'Arlon in Belgian Luxembourg with Stéphane Steeman. In December Brel appeared at the Olympia in Paris as the supporting act to Philippe Clay. The pianist Gérard Jouannest and François Rauber joined Brel on stage for this performance. Brel's incredibly emotional performance brought the house down.|$|E

5000|$|Since 1998, {{there have}} been 30 major league teams with a single advance {{schedule}} for every season that comprises 2430 games. Each team plays 162 games, 81 as the [...] "home" [...] team, 81 as the [...] "visitor". (This is true even on the <b>rare</b> <b>occasion</b> <b>when</b> a game is played at a ballpark not home to either team.) Occasionally, the advance schedule is subsequently altered due to a game postponement or a one-game tie-breaker to determine which team {{will play in the}} postseason.|$|R
5000|$|Miller {{began his}} career as a {{professional}} artist with a brief stint in the Chicago offices of Gerstel-Loeff before joining Morton Goldsholl Associates, a studio that was known at the time for its [...] "progressive hiring policies", in that it was one of the few firms then that hired minorities and women in a professional capacity. Because it was a small office with a reputation for innovation and quality, it was a <b>rare</b> <b>occasion</b> <b>when</b> a chance to work for Goldsholl presented itself, and when this happened in 1950, Miller pursued the opportunity with his usual diligence.|$|R
5000|$|The NFL {{moved the}} September 27 {{game between the}} Tennessee Titans and New York Jets at Giants Stadium from 4:15 pm EDT to 1:00 pm EDT, in {{response}} to a request from Jets owner Woody Johnson to change the time to accommodate the Jewish Yom Kippur holiday that began at sundown that evening. This marked a <b>rare</b> <b>occasion</b> <b>when</b> the Jets and Giants played at the same time (the Giants played at Tampa Bay). In general, both New York City teams are not scheduled to play at the same time. The Jets game aired on CBS (WCBS-TV in New York), while the Giants game aired on Fox (WNYW-TV).|$|R
500|$|By 1786, {{two-thirds of}} the coins in {{circulation}} in Britain were counterfeit, and the Royal Mint responded by shutting itself down, worsening the situation. Few of the silver coins being passed were genuine. [...] Even the copper coins were melted down and replaced with lightweight fakes. [...] The Royal Mint struck no copper coins for 48years, from 1773 until 1821. [...] The resultant gap was filled with copper tokens that approximated {{the size of the}} halfpenny, struck on behalf of merchants. [...] Boulton struck millions of these merchant pieces. On the <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> <b>when</b> the Royal Mint did strike coins, they were relatively crude, with quality control nonexistent.|$|E
500|$|The Donkey Kong {{character}} was redesigned with a distinct, three-dimensional physical appearance. While borrowing the red necktie introduced in 1994's Game Boy version of Donkey Kong, the character featured {{a new look}} that would become the standard that continues {{to be used in}} nearly all games featuring him. Until Microsoft's purchase of Rare in 2002, all Nintendo games featuring Donkey Kong (including Mario Kart 64, Super Smash Bros., and the Mario Party series) credited Rare for the use of their Donkey Kong model. To develop Donkey Kong's movements in the game, Rare staff spent hours at nearby Twycross Zoo observing and videotaping real gorillas. However, they found that on the <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> <b>when</b> the gorillas moved, their movements were [...] "completely unsuitable for a fast-paced videogame", and so Donkey and Diddy Kong's animations were instead loosely based on how a horse gallops.|$|E
500|$|Fauré's operas {{have not}} found {{a place in the}} regular repertoire. Prométhée is the more {{neglected}} of the two, with only a handful of performances in more than a century. Copland considered Pénélope (1913) a fascinating work, {{and one of the best}} operas written since Wagner; he noted, however, that the music is, as a whole, [...] "distinctly non-theatrical." [...] The work uses leitmotifs, and the two main roles call for voices of heroic quality, but these are the only ways in which the work is Wagnerian. In Fauré's late style, [...] "tonality is stretched hard, without breaking." [...] On the <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> <b>when</b> the piece has been staged, critical opinion has generally praised the musical quality of the score, but has varied as to the dramatic effectiveness of the work. When the opera was first presented in London in 1970, in a student production by the Royal Academy of Music, Peter Heyworth wrote, [...] "A score that offers rich rewards to an attentive ear can none the less fail to cut much ice in the theatre.... Most of the music is too recessive to be theatrically effective." [...] However, after a 2006 production at the Wexford Festival, Ian Fox wrote, [...] "Fauré's Pénélope is a true rarity, and, although some lovely music was anticipated, it was a surprise how sure the composer's theatrical touch was." ...|$|E

50|$|On the <b>rare</b> <b>occasion</b> (<b>when</b> {{there is}} a large VSD with no {{significant}} left ventricular outflow tract obstruction), initial symptoms may go unnoticed, resulting in the infant being discharged without treatment {{in the event of a}} hospital or birthing center birth, or a delay in bringing the infant for diagnosis in the event of a home birth. On these occasions, a layperson is likely not to recognize symptoms until the infant is experiencing moderate to serious congestive heart failure (CHF) as a result of the heart working harder in a futile attempt to increase oxygen flow to the body; this overworking of the heart muscle eventually leads to hypertrophy and may result in cardiac arrest if left untreated.|$|R
