40|$|How XIST RNA {{strictly}} localizes {{across the}} inactive X chromosome is unknown; however, prophase release of human XIST RNA provides a clue. Tests of inhibitors that mimic mitotic chromatin modifications implicated an indirect role of PP 1 (protein phosphatase 1), potentially via its interphase repression of Aurora B kinase (AURKB), which phosphorylates H 3 and chromosomal proteins at prophase. RNA interference to AURKB causes mitotic retention of XIST RNA, unlike other mitotic or broad kinase inhibitors. Thus, AURKB plays an unexpected role in regulating RNA binding to heterochromatin, independent of mechanics of mitosis. H 3 phosphorylation (H 3 ph) {{was shown to}} precede XIST RNA release, whereas results exclude H 1 ph involvement. Of numerous Xi chromatin (chromosomal protein) hallmarks, ubiquitination closely follows XIST RNA retention or release. Surprisingly, H 3 S 10 ph staining (but not H 3 S 28 ph) is excluded from Xi and is potentially linked to ubiquitination. Results suggest a model of multiple distinct anchor points for XIST RNA. This study advances understanding of <b>RNA</b> <b>chromosome</b> binding and the roles of AURKB and demonstrates a novel approach to manipulate and study XIST RNA...|$|E
40|$|Initiation of X {{chromosome}} inactivation {{requires the}} presence, in cis, of the X inactivation center (XIC). The Xist gene, which lies within the XIC region in {{both human and}} mouse and has the unique property of being expressed only from the inactive X chromosome in female somatic cells, {{is known to be}} essential for X inactivation based on targeted deletions in the mouse. Although our understanding of the developmental regulation and function of the mouse Xist gene has progressed rapidly, less is known about its human homolog. To address this and to assess the cross-species conservation of X inactivation, a 480 -kb yeast artificial chromosome containing the human XIST gene was introduced into mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. The human XIST transcript was expressed and could coat the mouse autosome from which it was transcribed, indicating that the factors required for cis association are conserved in mouse ES cells. Cis inactivation as a result of human XIST expression was found in only a proportion of differentiated cells, suggesting that the events downstream of XIST RNA coating that culminate in stable inactivation may require species-specific factors. Human XIST RNA appears to coat mouse autosomes in ES cells before in vitro differentiation, in contrast to the behavior of the mouse Xist gene in undifferentiated ES cells, where an unstable transcript and no chromosome coating are found. This may not only reflect important species differences in Xist regulation but also provides evidence that factors implicated in Xist <b>RNA</b> <b>chromosome</b> coating may already be present in undifferentiated ES cells...|$|E
40|$|Human {{colorectal}} carcinomas frequently express {{elevated levels}} of c-myc mRNA {{in the absence of}} a gross genetic change at the c-myc locus. To test the hypothesis that these tumors are defective in a gene function necessary for the regulation of c-myc expression, we fused an osteosarcoma cell line that exhibits normal c-myc regulation with two colon carcinoma cell lines that express deregulated levels of c-myc mRNA. The levels of c-myc transcripts in all of the hybrid clones examined were normal and were induced normally by a mitogenic stimulus. Since rates of c-myc mRNA turnover in the colon carcinoma cells were found to be comparable to those in normal cells, increased message stability cannot account for the increased steady-state levels of transcripts. Our findings suggest that loss of function of a trans-acting regulator is responsible for the deregulation of c-myc expression in a major fraction of colorectal carcinomas. Analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms in tumor/normal tissue pairs from patients with primary colorectal lesions indicated that deregulation of c-myc expression in the tumors is correlated with frequent loss of alleles of syntenic markers on chromosome 5 q; allele loss on 5 q could be detected in 9 of 19 tumors expressing deregulated levels of c-myc mRNA, but not in any of 8 tumors expressing normal levels of c-myc <b>RNA.</b> <b>Chromosome</b> 5 q is the region known to contain the gene for familial adenomatous polyposis, an inherited predisposition to colon cancer. These findings, together with the earlier finding that the colonic distribution of tumors exhibiting deregulated c-myc expression is similar to that reported for familial polyposis, provide evidence that loss of function of the familial adenomatous polyposis gene is involved in a subset of colorectal cancers in which c-myc expression is deregulated...|$|E
40|$|As {{we learn}} more about the human genome and the science of {{genetics}} our ability to perform genetic testing is increasing at a rapid pace. Genetic testing is often the best way to confirm a diagnosis in a patient with symptoms and features suggestive of a genetic disease. Today, there are hundreds of different genetic tests for disorders ranging from those that are relatively common, such as cystic fibrosis, to very rare disorders. Not all disorders will be tested for in the same way- there are many different types of tests (or techniques for genetic testing) which can be performed for various genetic diseases. A genetic test is defined as "the analysis of human DNA, <b>RNA,</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> proteins, and certain metabolites in order to detect heritable disease-related genotypes, mutations, phenotypes, or karyotypes for clinical purposes ‚Äù (Hotlzman, 1999).

We employ this methodology to determine exchange rates of labile hydrogens in both the packaged RNA genome and protein subunits of bean pod mottle virus (BPMV). In the BPMV assembly, {{which is similar to}} human picornaviruses, the x-ray structure indicates that about 20 % of the ssRNA chain is ordered at the threefold vertices of the icosahedral capsid, although the nucleotide bases in the ordered segments are not known (Chen et al., 1989). Here, we compare exchange profiles of the native virus with those of the empty capsid, model nucleic acids and aqueous solvent to reveal the following exchange characteristics of BPMV RNA and protein: (i) Base-specific retardation of exchange is observed in the packaged RNA. (ii) Retardation is greatest for uracil residues, for which the first-order exchange rate constant (kU = 0. 18 +/- 0. 02 min- 1) is 40 % lower than that of either the H 2 O solvent or adenine or cytosine groups of RNA (ksolv approximately kA approximately kC = 0. 30 +/- 0. 02 min- 1). (iii) Retardation of exchange is also observed for the guanine residues of packaged RNA. (iv) No appreciable exchange of amide NH groups of capsid subunits occurs within the time of complete exchange (t approximately 10 min) of packaged RNA or bulk solvent. Thus, the present results identify sites in both the protein subunits (amide NH) and RNA nucleotides (amino NH 2 and imino NH) which are resistant to solvent-catalyzed hydrogen exchange. We propose that retardation of exchange of labile sites of the RNA nucleotides is a consequence of the organization of the <b>RNA</b> <b>chromosome</b> within the virion. Our findings support a model for BPMV in which surface and buried domains of capsid subunits are extensively and rigidly hydrogen-bonded, and in which uracil and guanine exocyclic donor groups of packaged RNA are the principal targets for subunit interaction at the threefold vertices of the capsid...|$|E

40|$|As we {{have come}} to know, there is a {{connection}} between cancer biomarkers and genes, along with their susceptibility to a particular disease, all of which have an obvious impact on the clinical practice and development of genetic testing. In any cancer disease, the diagnosis and treatment should be related to the investigation of specific biomarkers (generally antigens and proteins) and their corresponding genes. The study of different antigens such as alpha-fetoprotein, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), insulin-like growth factor II, vascular endothelial growth factor, and epidermal growth factor, as well as their presence in neoplastic cells have demonstrated that IGF-I is an essential target for gene testing and therapeutic purpose. An over-expression of the IGF-I gene in mature tissues is a sign of neoplastic processes e. g. brain or breast malignancy. A lot of questions have arisen regarding the ethics of gene testing, particularly concerns on the selection of patients for specific growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor I (GHIIGF-I) testing. Evidently, our current society is involved in a process of geneticization ‚Äì the redefinition of individuals in terms of genetic codes. As such, we should take extreme care when making ethical judgments based on ‚Äúscientific evidence‚Äù derived from genetic testing (typically those involving different biomarkers such as DNA, <b>RNA,</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> and proteins) in relation to genetic abnormalities that could predict current or future diseases.

However, despite these differences, most virus populations will occasionally experience two commonly-encountered challenges: growth in variable host environments, and growth under fluctuating population sizes. We used the segmented RNA bacteriophage œï 6 {{as a model}} for studying the evolutionary genomics of virus adaptation in the face of host switches and parametrically varying population sizes. To do so, we created a bifurcating deme structure that reflected lineage splitting in natural populations, allowing us to test whether phylogenetic algorithms could accurately resolve this ‚Äòknown phylogeny‚Äô. The resulting tree yielded 32 clones at the tips and internal nodes; these strains were fully sequenced and measured for phenotypic changes in selected traits (fitness on original and novel hosts). Results We observed that RNA segment size was negatively correlated with the extent of molecular change in the imposed treatments; molecular substitutions tended to cluster on the Small and Medium <b>RNA</b> <b>chromosomes</b> of the virus, and not on the Large segment. Our study yielded a very large molecular and phenotypic dataset, fostering possible inferences on genotype-phenotype associations. Using further experimental evolution, we confirmed an inference on the unanticipated role of an allelic switch in a viral assembly protein, which governed viral performance across host environments. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that varying complexities can be simultaneously incorporated into experimental evolution, to examine the combined effects of population size, and adaptation in novel environments. The imposed bifurcating structure revealed that some methods for phylogenetic reconstruction failed to resolve the true phylogeny, owing to a paucity of molecular substitutions separating the RNA viruses that evolved in our study. </p...|$|R

The latter includes presymptomatic testing, which identifies individuals who are expected to become ill {{in the future and}} predisposition testing, which identifies those who are at increased risk of becoming ill. Decisions regarding genetic testing must be based not only on the analytic accuracy, availability and cost of the test, but on the clinical utility as well, including the sensitivity, specificity and interpretability of results. Clinical information, including the medical and family history and the findings of the physical examination, is vital for the selection of appropriate diagnostic tests, as well as the interpretation of the results. Presymptomatic genetic testing is a very personal choice that should only be made after the patient has had sufficient counseling to develop an understanding of the risks and benefits of the test and is able to make an informed decision. The same principle applies to predisposition testing; however, additional factors, such as the probability of a positive result, the likelihood that the disease will actually develop in those with positive results, the effect on the management of the index patient, the effects on family members, the risk of false reassurance if the result is negative or the potential for loss of hope if it is positive, all contribute to the assessment of risk versus benefit.

40|$|AbstractDuring X inactivation, {{mammalian}} female cells {{make the}} selection of one active and one inactive X chromosome. X chromosome choice occurs randomly and results in Xist upregulation on the inactive X. We have hypothesized that the antisense gene, Tsix, controls Xist expression.

Despite a deficiency of Tsix <b>RNA,</b> X <b>chromosome</b> counting remains intact: female cells still inactivate one X, while male cells block X inactivation. However, heterozygous female cells show skewed Xist expression and primary nonrandom inactivation of the mutant X. The ability of the mutant X to block Xist accumulation is compromised.

We {{have identified a}} cis-acting locus on human chromosome 6 that controls this replication-timing program. This locus encodes a large intergenic non-coding RNA gene named Asynchronous replication and Autosomal <b>RNA</b> on <b>chromosome</b> 6, or ASAR 6.

Centromeric ultrafine anaphase bridges are physiological DNA structures thought to contain unresolved DNA catenations between the centromeres separating during anaphase. BLM and PICH helicases colocalize at these ultrafine anaphase bridges and promote their resolution. As PICH is detectable at centromeres from prometaphase onwards, we hypothesized that BLM might also be located at centromeres and that the two proteins might cooperate to resolve DNA catenations before the onset of anaphase. Using immunofluorescence analyses, we demonstrated the recruitment of BLM to centromeres from G 2 phase to mitosis. With a combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization, electron microscopy, <b>RNA</b> interference, <b>chromosome</b> spreads and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we showed that both BLM-deficient and PICH-deficient prometaphase cells displayed changes in centromere structure.

The mechanisms driving these fusions are poorly understood, but recurrent fusions are widespread. This suggests an underlying mechanism, and some authors have proposed a possible role for RNA in this process.

This developmental process provides a powerful model system to directly test the influence of small noncoding <b>RNAs</b> on <b>chromosome</b> fusion events during somatic differentiation. Here we show that small RNAs are capable of inducing chromosome fusions in four distinct cases (out of four tested), including one fusion of three chromosomes. We further show that these RNA-mediated chromosome fusions are heritable over multiple sexual generations and that transmission of the acquired fusion is associated with endogenous production of novel piRNA molecules that target the fused junction. We also demonstrate the capacity of a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) to induce chromosome fusion of two distal germline loci.

The first method devised is a direct extension of standard light microscope in situ hybridization. Radioactively labeled complementary RNA (cRNA) is hybridized to metaphase chromosomes deposited on electron microscope grids and fixed in 70 percent ethanol vapor; hybridixation site are detected by autoradiography. Specific and intense labeling of chromosomal centromeric regions is observed even after relatively short exposure times. Inerphase nuclei present {{in some of the}} metaphase chromosome preparations also show defined paatterms of satellite DNA labeling which suggests that satellite-containing regions are associate with each other during interphase. The sensitivity of this method is estimated to at least as good as that at the light microscope level while the resolution is improved at least threefold.

40|$|During {{the course}} of {{experiments}} with larvae of Trichosia pubescens, we have unexpectedly found that diethyl ether or chloroform anesthesia induces a large puff in a specific band in the polytene chromosomes of the salivary glands. This puff develops {{a few minutes after}} the treatment, attaining its maximum size after 60 - 100 min, and regresses completely 200 min after its activation. Through autoradiography, an intense incorporation of RNA precursors into that puff was observed. A few other smaller puffs are also induced by the treatment. The treatment with diethyl ether or chloroform does not induce puffing in the polytene cells of malpighian tubules and of midgut.

40|$|The base {{composition}} of <b>RNA's</b> extracted from <b>chromosomes,</b> nucleoli, nuclear sap, and cytoplasm of Triturus oocytes {{has been determined}} by microelectrophoresis. The chromosomal RNA has a content of guanine+cytosine {{equal to that of}} DNA, but there is no complementarity in the composition as for DNA. Nuclear sap contains a highly variable RNA with a tendency towards high uracil values. Nucleolar and cytoplasmic RNA's are similar in composition and both are of the guanine-cytosine rich type. The chromosomes and nucleoli contain roughly equivalent amounts of RNA, somewhat less than is present in the nuclear sap. The RNA/DNA ratio of the whole chromosomes is about 10. However, the ratio in the synthetically active regions, the loops, is much higher, since the loops contain all the chromosomal RNA but {{only a small fraction of}} the DNA...|$|R
40|$|Telomeric repeat-containing RNA (referred to as TERRA), a noncoding RNA molecule, has {{recently}} been found in mammalian cells. The detailed structural features and function of the TERRA <b>RNA</b> at human <b>chromosome</b> ends remain unclear, although this RNA molecule may be {{a key component of}} the telomere machinery. In the present studies, we investigated the structural features of human TERRA RNA in living cells. Using a light-switching pyrene probe, we found that human TERRA RNA forms a parallel G-quadruplex structure in living cells, providing the in vivo evidence for the presence of the G-quadruplex in human TERRA RNA. Furthermore, imaging experiments clearly show that TERRA RNA G-quadruplex localizes to telomere DNA at cell nuclei. These results provide valuable information to allow understanding of the structure and function of human TERRA RNA...|$|R
40|$|Evolutionarily conserved {{functional}} {{domains of}} non-coding <b>RNA</b> on <b>chromosome</b> X (roX 1) {{have been identified}} in eight Drosophila species in a prior study. Among our findings, three GUUNUACG repeats were localized in the 3 ‚Ä≤-end of the predicted roX 1 RNAs for these Drosophila species. In this study, we use a covariance model (CM) to search for the characteristic features of roX 1 functional domains as a way to predict new examples of these structured RNAs in other Drosophila species, as sequencing data become available. We scan whole genomes of Drosophila and identify search results in available ‚Äúregion ÔøΩ terms, i. e., ‚Äúchromosome ÔøΩ or ‚ÄúscaffoldÔøΩ, depending on the annotation status of the particular species being surveyed. With known roX 1 examples produced through our prior studies for support in comparative analysis, we hypothesize {{that it is possible to}} predict novel roX 1 functional domains accurately from sequence information alone. Annotating roX 1 on a genomic scale provides insight into evolutionary processes and phylogenetic relationships among the analyzed species. Based on our results, we confirmed that a CM search is effective in mining roX 1 RNA genes and, that due to its inherent flexibility, this mining approach will likely prove successful for similar endeavours in various other organisms.
