40|$|We present {{evidence}} of a substantial ionospheric response to a strong interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) detected by the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding (MARSIS) on board the Mars Express (MEX) spacecraft. A powerful ICME impacted the Martian ionosphere beginning on 5 June 2011, peaking on 6 June, and trailing off over about a week. This event caused a strong response in the charged particle detector of the High-Energy Neutron Detector (HEND) on board the Odyssey spacecraft. The ion mass spectrometer of the Analyzer of Space Plasmas and Energetic Atoms instrument on MEX detected an increase in background counts, simultaneous with the increase seen by HEND, due to the flux of solar energetic particles (SEPs) associated with the ICME. Local densities and magnetic field strengths measured by MARSIS and enhancements of 100 eV electrons denote the passing of an intense space weather event. Local density and magnetosheath electron measurements and <b>remote</b> <b>soundings</b> show compression of ionospheric plasma to lower altitudes due to increased solar wind dynamic pressure. MARSIS topside sounding of the ionosphere indicates that it is extended well beyond the terminator, to about 116 ° solar zenith angle, in a highly disturbed state.

There were, however, systematic differences between the SAT and NOSAT mode analysis: the amplitude of weather systems was consistently less in the SAT mode.

40|$|International audienceThe Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding (MARSIS) on the Mars Express (MEX) {{spacecraft}} {{is capable}} of measuring ionospheric electron density {{by the use of}} two main methods: <b>remote</b> radar <b>sounding</b> and from the excitation of local plasma oscillations. The frequency of the locally excited electron plasma oscillations is used to measure the local electron density. However, plasma oscillations are not observed when the plasma flow velocity is higher than about 160 km/s, which occurs mainly in the solar wind and magnetosheath. As a consequence, in many passes, there is a sudden disappearance of the plasma oscillations as the spacecraft enters into the magnetosheath. This fact allows us to identify a flow velocity boundary on the dayside, between the ionosphere of Mars and the shocked solar wind. This paper summarizes the results of the measurement of 552 orbits mostly over a period from August 4, 2005 to August 17, 2007. The boundary points found using MARSIS have been verified by measurements from the Analyzer of Space Plasma and Energetic Atoms (ASPERA- 3) Electron Spectrometer (ELS) instrument on Mars Express. The average position of the flow velocity boundary is compared to flow velocity simulations computed using hybrid model and other boundaries.
