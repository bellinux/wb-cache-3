40|$|We {{reported}} the <b>relative</b> <b>responsivity</b> calibration of the grazing-incidence flat-field EUV spectrometer between 175 and 435 Å {{by means of}} two methods. The first method is implemented by measuring the diffraction efficiency of the grating with synchrotron radiation light source. Considering the transmission efficiency and quantum efficiency of the other optical components in the spectrometer, the total responsivity was then obtained. The second one {{was carried out by}} measuring line emissions from C 3 +, N 4 + and O 3 + ions at Shanghai high temperature super conductor electron beam ion trap (SH-HtscEBIT). The EUV spectra were also simulated theoretically via a collisional radiative model. In the calculation, the second-order relativistic many-body perturbation theory approach based on the flexible atomic code was used to calculate the energy levels and transition rates; the close-coupling R-matrix approach and relativistic distorted wave method were utilized to calculate the collision strength of electron impact excitation. In comparison with the spectroscopic measurements at EBIT device, the differences between the measured and simulated relative line intensities were obtained. The responsivity calibration for the spectrometer was then achieved by a 3 rd degree polynomial function fitting. Our measurement shows that the responsivity between 175 and 435 Å varies by factor of ∼ 46. The two results of calibration demonstrated a consistency within an average deviation of 24 %.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a bolometric detector that is intrinsically sensitive to linear polarization which is optimized for making measurements of the polarization of {{the cosmic microwave background}} radiation. The receiver consists of a pair of co-located silicon nitride micromesh absorbers which couple anisotropically to linearly polarized radiation through a corrugated waveguide structure. This system allows simultaneous background limited measurements of the Stokes I and Q parameters over ~ 30 % bandwidths at frequencies from ~ 60 to 600 GHz. Since both linear polarizations traverse identical optical paths from the sky to the point of detection, the susceptibility to systematic effects is minimized. The amount of uncorrelated noise between the two polarization senses is limited to the quantum limit of thermal and photon shot noise, while drifts in the <b>relative</b> <b>responsivity</b> to orthogonal polarizations are limited to the effect of non-uniformity in the thin film deposition of the leads and the intrinsic thermistor properties. Devices using NTD Ge thermistors have achieved NEPs of 2 x 10 ^{- 17 } W/sqrt{Hz} with a 1 /f knee below 100 mHz at a base temperature of 270 mK. Numerical modelling of the structures has been used to optimize the bolometer geometry and coupling to optics. Comparisons of numerical results and experimental data are made. A description of how the quantities measured by the device can be interpreted in terms of the Stokes parameters is presented.

40|$|Abstract {{published}} in Journal of Vision, 15 (12) : 751, 2015 International audienceNeuroimaging studies {{have identified a}} network of regions in the human ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOTC) sensitive to faces. Using intra-cerebral electrophysiological recordings, we compared the <b>relative</b> <b>responsivity</b> of the different regions to face-structure using a periodic visual stimulation paradigm. Recordings were made in 17 epileptic patients implanted with linear-array depth-electrodes (> 1000 contacts in the VOTC). In Experiment 1, we presented sequences of phase-scrambled and intact face stimuli (equalised for low-level image properties) alternating at a fixed frequency of 3 Hz (6 images/s) while patients completed an orthogonal task. Significant periodic EEG responses (SSVEPs) reflecting high-level face structure processing were found at 3 Hz, while responses reflecting low-level visual processing (e. g. local contrast change) were recorded at 6 Hz. An index of high-level processing (3 Hz/(3 Hz+ 6 Hz)) showed a posterior-to-anterior gradient, reflecting increased sensitivity to face structure going from the occipital to the temporo-polar cortex, with a right hemisphere lateralisation. In Experiment 2, we further investigated face structure processing with a sweep VEP paradigm (Ales et al., 2012; 4 / 17 patients). Stimulation was similar to Experiment 1 except the visibility (phase coherence) of the face image was parametrically varied so that a face gradually emerged {{over the course of}} a sequence. The patients performed a face detection task during the trials. Responses at 3 Hz, objective markers of face detection, were found in all patients on contacts in the lateral fusiform gyrus and inferior occipital gyrus that overlapped with those defined in Experiment 1. All regions showed non-linear voltage vs coherence functions at 3 Hz, with thresholds lying around ≈ 40 % coherence. Sites in the lateral fusiform gyrus had a distinct step-like response profile suggestive of categorical face detection. These findings demonstrate that face-sensitive regions are organised with a posterior-to-anterior gradient of increasingly selective high-level visual processing. These regions appear to detect face structure in a non-linear/categorical manner. Meeting abstract presented at VSS 2015...|$|E

40|$|An {{interferometric}} {{technique is}} proposed {{for determining the}} spatial forms of the individual degrees of freedom through which a many body system can absorb energy from its environment. The method separates out the coherent excitations present at any given frequency; {{it is not necessary}} to infer modal content from spectra. The system under test is excited with two external sources, which create generalized forces, and the fringe in the total power dissipated is measured as the relative phase between the sources is varied. If the complex fringe visibility is measured for different pairs of source locations, the anti-Hermitian part of the complex-valued non-local correlation tensor can be determined, which can then be decomposed to give the natural dynamical modes of the system and their <b>relative</b> <b>responsivities.</b> If each source in the interferometer creates a different kind of force, the spatial forms of the individual excitations that are responsible for cross-correlated response can be found. The technique is a generalization of holography because it measures the state of coherence to which the system is maximally sensitive. It can be applied across a wide range of wavelengths, in a variety of ways, to homogeneous media, thin films, patterned structures, and to components such as sensors, detectors and energy harvesting absorbers.

40|$|Abstract. The {{performance}} of a pyroelectric detector with a carbon multi-walled nanotube coating was evaluated in the 0. 9 µm to 14 µm wavelength range. The <b>relative</b> spectral <b>responsivity</b> of this detector was shown to be flat {{over most of the}} wavelength range examined and the spectral flatness was shown to be comparable to the best infrared black coatings currently available.

The responsivity of this detector was shown to be linear in the 0. 06 mW to 2. 8 mW radiant power range and its spatial uniformity was similar to other pyroelectric detectors utilising different types of black coatings. The carbon nanotube coatings were reported to be much more durable than other infrared black coatings commonly used to coat thermal detectors in the infrared, such as metal-blacks. This, in combination with its excellent spectral flatness demonstrated by this paper suggests that carbon nanotube coatings appears extremely promising for thermal detection applications in the infrare...|$|R
40|$|To {{implement}} the detector-based radiometric {{scale in the}} new Medium Background Infrared (MBIR) facility at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), we have developed an electrical substitution cavity radiometer that can be operated just above liquid nitrogen temperature. This MBIR Active Cavity Radiometer (ACR) utilizes a temperature-controlled receiver cone and an independently temperature-controlled heat sink. Being a thermal-type detector, low noise and drift of the radiometer signal depends mainly on low-noise temperature control of the receiver and heat sink. Using high critical-temperature (Tc) superconducting thin film temperature sensors in the active control loops, we have achieved closed-loop temperature controllability of better than 10 µK at 89 K for a receiver having an open-loop thermal time constant of about 75 seconds. For a flux level of 1 µW to 10 µW, the rms noise floor over a measurement cycle time is below 20 nW. This is the lowest noise level yet reported for a liquid nitrogen cooled electrical-substitution radiometer, {{and it is the}} first demonstration of the use of high-Tc superconductors in such a radiometer. Potential uses for this ACR in the MBIR facility include absolute measurement of the broadband radiance of large-area 300 K cryogenic blackbody sources, and absolute measurement of the spectral radiance of laser-illuminated integrating spheres for improved <b>relative</b> spectral <b>responsivity</b> measurements of infrared transfer standard radiometers. ...|$|R

Because {{of the high}} power of lasers, {{there is also a}} drastic increase in dynamic range covering more than 5 orders of magnitude. The low measurement uncertainty and high dynamic range allow accurate assessment of out-of-band performance for flight instruments such as the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) Visible and Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor which was calibrated in 2010 for Absolute Spectral Responsivity (ASR) with full aperture illumination using a tunable laser and a large integrating sphere with an approximately 0. 5 % uncertainty in radiance responsivity. With the calibration data, it is now possible to fully evaluate the effect of out-of-band (OOB) contribution on at-sensor water-leaving radiance and derive strategy to alleviate variations from OOB scattering and reduce data product uncertainties.
