25|$|A commutated DC motor has {{a set of}} {{rotating}} windings {{wound on}} an armature mounted on a rotating shaft. The shaft also carries the commutator, a long-lasting rotary electrical switch that periodically reverses the flow of current in the <b>rotor</b> <b>windings</b> as the shaft rotates. Thus, every brushed DC motor has AC flowing through its rotating windings. Current flows through one or more pairs of brushes that bear on the commutator; the brushes connect an external source of electric power to the rotating armature.|$|E
25|$|A {{synchronous}} {{electric motor}} is an AC motor distinguished by a rotor spinning with coils passing magnets {{at the same}} rate as the AC and resulting in a magnetic field that drives it. Another way of saying this is that it has zero slip under usual operating conditions. Contrast this with an induction motor, which must slip to produce torque. One type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except the rotor is excited by a DC field. Slip rings and brushes are used to conduct current to the rotor. The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed hence the name synchronous motor. Another type, for low load torque, has flats ground onto a conventional squirrel-cage rotor to create discrete poles. Yet another, such as made by Hammond for its pre-World War II clocks, and in the older Hammond organs, has no <b>rotor</b> <b>windings</b> and discrete poles. It is not self-starting. The clock requires manual starting by a small knob on the back, while the older Hammond organs had an auxiliary starting motor connected by a spring-loaded manually operated switch.|$|E

40|$|The {{assumption}} is often made when investigating induction motor’s magnetic field that the rotor winding is polyphase and the polyphase current flows in {{the bars of}} rotor. The assumption causes difficulties {{in the evaluation of}} <b>rotor</b> <b>winding’s</b> geometrical parameters and in the determination of bars location in the slots of the rotor. The geometrical peculiarities of squirrel-cage rotors winding, such as the angle β, are not taken into consideration by the theory of squirrel-cage induction machine given in literature. It is proved that the strength of magnetic field, creating the torque rotating the rotor, depends on the angle β. The expression of resultant torque created by squirrel-cage rotor’s teeth of induction motor has been derived. The two-layer winding of rotor is often used for the wound-rotor induction machines. In this case the angle of rotor winding section’s magnetic axis γ ≠ 0. Though the initial starting torque of induction motor having wound-rotor with two-layer winding is relatively small because the angle γ amounts just 3 ° – 5 °. Meanwhile the angle γ of squirrel-cage rotor’s construction referred in the paper reaches 25 ° – 35 ° and therefore the induction motor having the squirrel-cage rotor of described construction creates relatively larger initial starting torque...|$|R

50|$|Once at speed, the <b>rotor</b> <b>windings</b> become {{functionally}} {{equivalent to}} the squirrel-cage structure of a conventional induction motor, and the motor runs as such.|$|E
5000|$|The induced {{currents}} in the <b>rotor</b> <b>windings</b> in turn create magnetic {{fields in the}} rotor that react against the stator field. Due to Lenz's Law, {{the direction of the}} magnetic field created will be such as to oppose the change in current through the <b>rotor</b> <b>windings.</b> The cause of induced current in the <b>rotor</b> <b>windings</b> is the rotating stator magnetic field, so to oppose the change in rotor-winding currents the rotor will start to rotate {{in the direction of the}} rotating stator magnetic field. The rotor accelerates until the magnitude of induced rotor current and torque balances the applied mechanical load on the rotation of the rotor. Since rotation at synchronous speed would result in no induced rotor current, an induction motor always operates slightly slower than synchronous speed. The difference, or [...] "slip," [...] between actual and synchronous speed varies from about 0.5 to 5.0% for standard Design B torque curve induction motors. [...] The induction motor's essential character is that it is created solely by induction instead of being separately excited as in synchronous or DC machines or being self-magnetized as in permanent magnet motors.|$|E
40|$|The leakage {{reactance}} end {{component is}} calculated {{by considering the}} net flux linking the stator end winding when both stator and rotor are excited with currents so that the net flux density in the airgap is zero. The stator and <b>rotor</b> end <b>windings</b> are assumed to consist of coils that close through the airgap by means of fictitious filaments and thus their respective current distributions are represented by systems of closed currents. Iron boundaries other than the end plate are neglected and the end plate {{is considered to be}} unsaturated and also a magnetic mirror, i. e. mu= infinity, sigma= 0...|$|R
25|$|The {{magnetic}} flux {{created by the}} field windings follows {{the path of least}} magnetic reluctance, meaning the flux will flow through poles of the rotor that are closest to the energized poles of the stator, thereby magnetizing those poles of the rotor and creating torque. As the <b>rotor</b> turns, different <b>windings</b> will be energized, keeping the rotor turning.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of {{induction}} heating, the motor-generator was used extensively for the production of MF power up to 10 kHz. While it is possible to generate multiples of the supply frequency such as 150 Hz using a standard induction motor driving an AC generator, there are limitations. This type of generator featured <b>rotor</b> mounted <b>windings</b> which limited the peripheral speed of the rotor due to the centrifugal forces on these windings. This had the effect of limiting the diameter of the machine and therefore its power and the number of poles which can be physically accommodated, which in turn limits the maximum operating frequency.|$|R
5000|$|The rotary {{converter}} {{can be thought}} of as a motor-generator, where the two machines share a single rotating armature and set of field coils. The basic construction of the {{rotary converter}} consists of a DC generator (dynamo) with a set of slip rings tapped into its <b>rotor</b> <b>windings</b> at evenly spaced intervals. When a dynamo is spun the electric currents in its <b>rotor</b> <b>windings</b> alternate as it rotates in the magnetic field of the stationary field windings. This alternating current is rectified by means of a commutator which allows DC current to be extracted from the rotor. This principle is taken advantage of by energizing the same <b>rotor</b> <b>windings</b> with AC power which causes the machine to act as a synchronous AC motor. The rotation of the energized coils excites the stationary field windings producing part of the DC current. The other part is AC current from the slip rings which is directly rectified into DC by the commutator. This makes the rotary converter a hybrid dynamo and mechanical rectifier. When used in this way it is referred to as a synchronous rotary converter or simply a synchronous converter. The AC slip rings also allow the machine to act as an alternator.|$|E
50|$|This {{can cause}} serious {{damage to the}} dynamos and power plant, {{potentially}} resulting in centrifugal warping and collision of the <b>rotor</b> <b>windings</b> with the field coils, shaft bearing overspeed and failure, and damage to the driving engine, the engine governor, or the rotary power transmission system.|$|E
50|$|A wound-rotor motor {{is a type}} of {{induction}} motor where the <b>rotor</b> <b>windings</b> are connected through slip rings to external resistances. Adjusting the resistance allows control of the speed/torque characteristic of the motor. Wound-rotor motors can be started with low inrush current, by inserting high resistance into the rotor circuit; as the motor accelerates, the resistance can be decreased.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} work {{is focused on}} developing simple parametric models of the unbalanced magnetic pull produced in eccentric-rotor electrical machines. The influence of currents circulating in the parallel paths of the stator winding on the unbalanced magnetic pull is given the main attention. The interaction between these currents and those circulating in the rotor cage/damper winding is also considered. First, a parametric force model for an eccentric-rotor salient-pole synchronous machine is developed. The effects of the parallel stator windings are not considered in this model. Next, a low-order parametric force model is built for electrical machines equipped with parallel stator windings but operating without the rotor cage/damper winding. This force model is applicable to salient-pole synchronous machines {{as well as to}} induction motors. And finally, a special force model is developed for electrical machines furnished with parallel paths both in the <b>rotor</b> and stator <b>windings.</b> This model accounts for the equalising currents circulating in the <b>rotor</b> and stator <b>windings</b> and also for the interaction between these currents. This third force model can be applied to a salient-pole synchronous machine and to an induction machine. The parameters of the force models are estimated from the results of numerical simulations applying a soft-computing-based estimation program. All the developed force models with the estimated parameters demonstrate a very good performance in a wide whirling frequency range. The effects of parallel paths in the <b>rotor</b> and stator <b>windings</b> on the unbalanced magnetic pull are investigated numerically. The acquired results reveal that the total unbalanced magnetic pull and its constituents related to the fundamental magnetic field and slotting are strongly affected by the presence of parallel paths in the stator winding. However, unlike the rotor cage, parallel stator windings may instigate anisotropy in the unbalanced magnetic pull. In such cases, the results of the numerical impulse response test may differ significantly from the conventional calculation results. It is also shown that, {{despite the fact that the}} number of parallel paths in the stator is often substantially lower than the number of parallel paths in the <b>rotor,</b> parallel stator <b>windings</b> may still provide a more efficient UMP mitigation than the rotor cage/damper winding. reviewe...|$|R

At least one groove is formed along the length of a wire substrate which is then twisted into a helix and a layer of intermetallic superconducting material is formed in the groove. This layer can be formed by depositing the desired intermetallic compound into the groove or by diffusing one component of the superconductor into the groove formed in a substrate composed of the other component. The superconductor prepared by this method comprises a non-superconductor wire twisted into the shape of a helix, having at least one groove containing a layer of superconductor material {{along the length of the}} wire...|$|R
50|$|Synchronous motors use DC-voltage-fed <b>rotor</b> <b>windings,</b> {{which lets}} the {{excitation}} {{of the machine}} be controlled—and induction motors use short-circuited rotors (instead of a magnet) following the rotating magnetic field of a multicoiled stator.

50|$|Electromagnetic-rotor {{machines}} are machines having {{some kind of}} electric current in the rotor which creates a magnetic field which interacts with the stator windings.

Many of the rings presently in service are susceptible to intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC) in the presence of moisture.

There is also no electrical loss associated with the rotor since there are no windings, commutator, or slip rings...|$|R
5000|$|Earlier Underground stock, {{like most}} {{electric}} trains until the 1990s, used DC motors. These are now regarded as inefficient, {{partly because they}} are traditionally controlled by resistors, and partly because a three-phase AC induction motor is smaller and lighter for the same power. However, in an AC motor maximum torque can only be achieved when {{the resistance of the}} <b>rotor</b> <b>windings</b> equals the reactance. AC motors in an industrial setting tend to be operated more or less continuously and therefore large banks of resistors can be used on start-up to raise resistance and maintain torque. This would not be efficient in a small motor designed for stop/start operation. As a result, it was only the invention of electronic control systems from the 1980s onwards that made AC traction viable for trains. The motor can be supplied using an inverter, and by varying the inverter's output frequency it is possible to keep the frequency of the currents flowing in the <b>rotor</b> <b>windings</b> constant, and hence the reactance (while resistance remains fixed).|$|E
50|$|DFIG for Double Fed Induction Generator, a {{generating}} principle {{widely used}} in wind turbines. It {{is based on an}} induction generator with a multiphase wound rotor and a multiphase slip ring assembly with brushes for access to the <b>rotor</b> <b>windings.</b> It is possible to avoid the multiphase slip ring assembly (see brushless doubly-fed electric machines), but there are problems with efficiency, cost and size.

50|$|If the {{stator winding}} is {{connected}} to the primary phase, the total voltage seen from the neutral (N) will be the sum of the voltages at both <b>windings</b> <b>rotor</b> and stator. Translating this to electric phasors, both phasors are connected. However, there is an angular shifting of α between them. Since α can be freely chosen between π, both phasors can be added or subtracted, so all the values in between are attainable. The primary and secondary are not isolated. Also, the ratio of the magnitudes of voltages between rotor and stator is constant; the resultant voltage varies owing to the angular shifting of the series winding induced voltage.|$|R
50|$|Generally, {{electric}} machines can {{be turned}} inside out, so that rotor and stator exchange roles. All rotating electric machines have an equivalent linear electric machine where the stator moves along a straight line instead of rotating. The opposite—linear to rotary dual—is not always the case. Motors and generators can be designed with or without iron to improve {{the path of the}} magnetic field (teeth to reduce the air gap is a common example) and with and without permanent magnets (PM), with different pole number etc., but still belong to different classes of machines. Electric machines can be synchronous meaning that the magnetic field set up by the stator coils rotates with the same speed as the rotor; or asynchronous, meaning that there is a speed difference. PM machines and reluctance machines are always synchronous. Brushed machines with <b>rotor</b> <b>windings</b> can be synchronous when the rotor is supplied with DC or AC with same frequency as stator or asynchronous when stator and rotor are supplied with AC with different frequencies. Induction machines are usually asynchronous, but can be synchronous, if there are superconductors in the <b>rotor</b> <b>windings.</b>|$|E
50|$|When light strikes one of {{the solar}} cells, it generates an {{electric}} current thus energizing {{one of the}} <b>rotor</b> <b>windings.</b> This produces a magnetic field, which interacts with the field of the magnet under the rotor. This interaction causes the rotor to turn. As the rotor rotates, the next solar cell moves into the light and energizes the second winding, creating a current in an opposite direction to the first, thus maintaining the rotation. This process repeats as the motor spins.|$|E
50|$|A commutated DC motor has {{a set of}} {{rotating}} windings {{wound on}} an armature mounted on a rotating shaft.

5000|$|Induction {{eliminates}} the need for brushes which is usually a weak part in an electric machine. It also allows designs which make it very easy to manufacture the rotor. A metal cylinder will work as rotor, but to improve efficiency a [...] "squirrel cage" [...] rotor or a <b>rotor</b> with closed <b>windings</b> is usually used. The speed of asynchronous induction machines will decrease with increased load because a larger speed difference between stator and rotor is necessary to set up sufficient rotor current and rotor magnetic field. Asynchronous induction machines can be made so they start and run without any means of control if connected to an AC grid, but the starting torque is low.|$|R
50|$|Brushless motors can be {{constructed}} in several different physical configurations: In the 'conventional' (also known as inrunner) configuration, the permanent magnets {{are part of the}} <b>rotor.</b> Three stator <b>windings</b> surround the <b>rotor.</b> In the outrunner (or external-rotor) configuration, the radial-relationship between the coils and magnets is reversed; the stator coils form the center (core) of the motor, while the permanent magnets spin within an overhanging rotor which surrounds the core. The flat or axial flux type, used where there are space or shape limitations, uses stator and rotor plates, mounted face to face. Outrunners typically have more poles, set up in triplets to maintain the three groups of windings, and have a higher torque at low RPMs. In all brushless motors, the coils are stationary.|$|R

The similarities and the differences between BLDCs and PMSMs BLDCs and PMSMs are both permanent magnet-based motors with the same basic structure, consisting of permanent magnets on the <b>rotor</b> and <b>windings</b> on the stator. The drive currents in the windings must be synchronized with rotor position feedback, which can come from sensors (typically Hall Effect) on the rotor or by evaluating the motor by back electromotive force (EMF). In general we prefer to use a no sensor motor and save the additional part and cost. The drive signals for the two motor types are different: A PMSM is driven sinusoidally, while a BLDC is driven trapezoidally making the PMSM much quieter, both electrically and mechanically. Plus, it has virtually no torque ripple. Programming the complex sinusoidal waveform control algorithms drove the development costs too high and required a more powerful and more expensive processor than what needed for the relatively simple trapezoidal control of a BLDC motor. So PMSMS can not instead of BLDCS. Wit...|$|R
