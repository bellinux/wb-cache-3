500|$|Hubbard became Parsons' [...] "magical partner" [...] for a sex magic ritual {{involving}} {{that was}} intended to summon an incarnation of a goddess. Although they got on well as fellow occultists, tensions {{between the two men}} were apparent in more domestic settings. Hubbard and Northrup made no secret of their relationship; another lodger at Parsons' house described how he saw Hubbard [...] "living off Parsons' largesse and making out with his girlfriend <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> Sometimes when {{the two of them were}} sitting at the table together, the hostility was almost tangible." [...] Despite the tensions between them, Hubbard, Northrup and Parsons agreed at the start of 1946 that they would go into business together, buying yachts on the East Coast and sailing them to California to sell at a profit. They set up a business partnership on January 15, 1946 under the name of [...] "Allied Enterprises", with Parsons putting up $20,000 of capital, Hubbard adding $1,200 and Northrup contributing nothing. Hubbard and Northrup left for Florida towards the end of April, taking with him $10,000 drawn from the Allied Enterprises account to fund the purchase of the partnership's first yacht. Weeks passed without word from Hubbard. Louis Culling, another O.T.O. member, wrote to Karl Germer to explain the situation: ...|$|E

As the old man gave him the tablet, Zhou Qun asked him, [...] "When were you born?" ...|$|E

'I should {{very much like to}} be allowed to spend the night there,' thought Little Klaus; and he went and knocked at the door. The farmer's wife opened it, but when she heard what he wanted she told him to go away; her husband was not at home, and she took in no strangers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sh-h-h," [...] {{said little}} Mrs. Whitefoot, as Whitefoot entered the snug little {{room of the}} house they had built in the old nest of Melody the Wood Thrush. Whitefoot hesitated. In the first place, it was dark in there. In the second place, he {{had the feeling that}} somehow that little bedroom seemed crowded. It hadn't been that way the last time he was there. Mrs. Whitefoot was <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> and she seemed very much excited about something.|$|E
60|$|Then he crept {{a little}} farther in. <b>Right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> was a little round doorway with a little wire door. Chatterer pushed the little door with his nose, and it opened a teeny, weeny bit. He drew back suspiciously. Then he tried it again, and this time pushed the little door {{a little farther}} open. He did this {{two or three times}} until finally he had his head quite inside, and there, right down below him, was that food he so wanted to taste.|$|E

The creature before him, though scarce distinguishable from the surrounding gloom, was not long-bodied like an ox. He could perceive that clearly. It was tall like a man--very tall. Perhaps it was Mark Breezy? The recent mistake made him think anything possible! ...|$|E
60|$|Work is bad enough, but Examinations are worse, {{especially}} the Board Examinations. By doing from ten to twenty minutes prep every night, the compleat slacker {{could get through}} most of the term with average success. Then came the Examinations. The dabbler in unseen translations found himself caught as in a snare. Gone was the peaceful security in which he had lulled to rest all the well-meant efforts of his guardian angel to rouse him to a sense of his duties. There, <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> yawned the abyss of Retribution.|$|E
60|$|On Lightfoot struggled. At last he felt bottom {{beneath his}} feet.

He had come out into the back yard of the home of that man. It is doubtful which was the more surprised, Lightfoot or the man. Right then and there Lightfoot gave up in despair. He couldn't run. It was all he could do to walk. The long chase by the hounds {{on the other side of}} the Big River and the long swim across the Big River had taken all his strength.|$|E

60|$|He leaped half out, {{and some}} one snapped a picture. It {{looked like a}} {{fortunate}} opportunity grasped. We tried him again, with flying-fish and barracuda. But he would not take either. Yet he loafed around on the surface, showing his colors, quite near the boat. He leaped clear out once, but I saw only the splash. Then he came out sideways, a skittering sort of plunge, lazy and heavy. He was about a three-hundred pounder, white and blue and green, a rare specimen of fish. We tried him again and drew a bait <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> No use! Then we charged him--ran him down. Even then he was not frightened, and came up astern. At last, discouraged at his indifference, we left him.|$|E
60|$|The door, {{which he}} had closed behind him, was now open, and <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> with the lamp-light shining upon it, was the mummy case. Three minutes ago it had been empty. He could swear to that. Now it framed the lank body of its horrible occupant, who stood, grim and stark, with his black shrivelled face towards the door. The form was lifeless and inert, {{but it seemed to}} Smith as he gazed that there still lingered a lurid spark of vitality, some faint sign of {{consciousness}} in the little eyes which lurked {{in the depths of the}} hollow sockets. So astounded and shaken was he that he had forgotten his errand, and was still staring at the lean, sunken figure when the voice of his friend below recalled him to himself.|$|E
60|$|Peter Rabbit {{never will}} forget {{the first time}} he saw Seek-Seek the Ground Squirrel, often wrongly called Gopher or Gopher Squirrel, but whose real name is Spermophile, which means seed eater. Peter won't forget that meeting, because of the funny mistake he made and the foolish feeling he had as a result of it. You see, Peter didn't know that there was such a person as Seek-Seek. He was hopping along across the Green Meadows in his usual happy-go-lucky way when, <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> he saw what at first he took to be a stake, a small stake, driven in the ground. But as he drew nearer, it {{suddenly}} moved. It wasn't a stake at all, but a very lively small person in a striped coat who had been sitting up very straight and motionless.|$|E
