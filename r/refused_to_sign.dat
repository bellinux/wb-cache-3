5|$|Also in 1957, Florida's {{response}} was mixed. Its legislature passed an Interposition Resolution denouncing {{the decision and}} declaring it null and void.

5|$|The painting, {{the figures}} painted from life when possible, {{does not contain}} all the signers. Some had died and images could not be located. One figure {{had participated in the}} {{drafting}} but did not sign the final document; another <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign.</b> In fact the membership of the Second Continental Congress changed as time passed, and the figures in the painting were never in the same room at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Thirty-nine delegates {{signed the}} {{finalized}} Constitution. Thirteen delegates left {{before it was}} completed, and three who remained at the convention until the end <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> it: Mason, Gerry, and Edmund Randolph of Virginia.

5|$|I {{consider}} {{him to be}} {{one of my best friends}} but the real thing is about managers: I think Steinman's manager is the devil and Steinman feels the same way about my manager. So, we had to communicate through managers and he <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> some papers that would have allowed for the recording of Bat Out of Hell III without a hitch. So, really, I didn't sue Jim Steinman. I sued his manager.|$|E
5|$|Silcott {{was arrested}} for Blakelock's murder on 12 October 1985, six days after the riot; he was interviewed five times over 24 hours, Det Ch Supt Melvin asking the {{questions}} and Detective Inspector Maxwell Dingle taking the notes. During the first four interviews, he stayed mostly silent and <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> the detectives' notes, but during the fifth interview on 13 October, when Melvin said he knew Silcott had struck Blakelock with a machete or sword, his demeanour changed, according to the notes.|$|E

5|$|The Red Star Line changed Kroonland from American to Belgian {{registry}} on 6 November 1908 in Antwerp. One reason {{given for}} the change was to allow Red Star to hire non-American crews at lower cost. She made her maiden voyage under the Belgian flag the next day. In May 1911, Kroonlands crew, acting on rumors of an impending British mariner's strike, <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> on for the ship's next voyage, forcing Red Star to hire a replacement crew.|$|E

Two empty tubes of amphetamines and a half-full tube {{were found in the}} rear pocket of his racing jersey, one of which was labelled Tonedron. The British team was called in for questioning and their baggage was searched. Two of the Belgian soigneurs– who looked after riders on the British team including Simpson– locked themselves in their room, got drunk and did not come out.|$|E
5|$|Chapman's subterfuge succeeded, as {{he managed}} to bargain the inebriated Bolton {{directors}} down to £10,890. He was less successful {{in his attempt to}} sign Jimmy McGrory from Celtic. He had set up a meeting with Celtic manager Willie Maley and young McGrory in summer 1928 when Maley and McGrory {{were on their way to}} a pilgrimage in Lourdes. A huge sum was offered (a blank cheque, some say) for the prolific McGrory, and Maley was more than ready to accept, for Celtic needed money to pay for their new stand. The deal fell through when McGrory, a homesick young Scotsman with an intense love for Celtic, <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign.</b> He later (in 1935) broke the all-time goalscoring record.|$|E

His writings have been a significant influence on political thought and events, including substantial portions of the Fairfax Resolves of 1774, the Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776, and his Objections to this Constitution of Government (1787) in opposition to ratification of the constitution. The Virginia Declaration of Rights, which Mason principally authored, served {{as a basis for}} the United States Bill of Rights, of which he has been deemed the father.|$|E
5|$|Goebel died of {{his wounds}} on February 3, 1900.

5|$|Goebel died of {{his wounds}} on February 3. He {{remains the only}} American {{governor}} ever assassinated while in office. With Goebel, the most controversial figure in the election, dead, tensions began to ease somewhat. Leaders from both sides drafted an agreement whereby Taylor and Lieutenant Governor Marshall would step down from their respective offices; in exchange, they would receive immunity from prosecution in any actions they may have taken with regard to Goebel's assassination. The state militia would withdraw from Frankfort, and the Goebel Election Law would be repealed and replaced with a fairer law. Despite the agreement of his allies, Taylor <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> the agreement. He did, however, lift the ban on the General Assembly meeting in Frankfort.|$|E
