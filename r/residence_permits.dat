5|$|Also {{included}} in the plan is an outline for raising awareness about human trafficking across Canada. The plan specifically mentions TruckSTOP, a campaign of Persons Against the Crime of Trafficking in Humans Ottawa, as being integral to the plan. According to the plan, the CBSA is responsible for informing foreigners about human trafficking because of their increased vulnerability. The plan includes a provision {{for the government to}} partner with NGOs that oppose human trafficking. Although Smith said that human trafficking would be more effectively combatted if Canada's prostitution laws were reformed to align with those of Sweden, criminalizing the purchasing rather than the selling of sex, the NAP-CHT does not make such legislative recommendations. The plan enables immigration officers to issue temporary <b>residence</b> <b>permits</b> to foreigners victimized by human trafficking in Canada, thereby providing these victims with opportunities to receive aid.|$|E

25|$|Asylum seekers who request {{international}} {{protection under the}} Geneva Convention from a Schengen member state are not issued a residence permit, but are instead issued, within three days of the application being lodged, an authorisation {{to remain on the}} territory of the member state while the application is pending or being examined.

25|$|The UK's {{reluctance}} {{to join the}} Schengen Area, through concerns over loss of independent border controls, is usually cited {{as the reason for}} not joining. Britain argued that, for an island, frontier controls are a better and less intrusive way to prevent illegal immigration than other measures, such as identity cards, <b>residence</b> <b>permits,</b> and registration with the police. Consequent difficulties for Ireland, given its location and shared border with the United Kingdom (at which border points would have to be set up), would then make it very difficult for Ireland to join without the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of the war, Switzerland interned 300,000 refugees. 104,000 of these were foreign troops interned {{according}} to the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers outlined in the Hague Conventions.

Refugees were not allowed to hold jobs. 60,000 of the refugees were civilians escaping persecution by the Nazis. Of these, 26,000 to 27,000 were Jews.
