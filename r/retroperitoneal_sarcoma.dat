50|$|IORT {{was found}} to be useful and {{feasible}} in the multidisciplinary management of many solid tumors but further studies are needed to determine the benefit more precisely. Single-institution experiences have suggested a role of IORT e.g. in brain tumors and cerebral metastases, locally advanced and recurrent rectal cancer, skin cancer, <b>retroperitoneal</b> <b>sarcoma,</b> pancreatic cancer and selected gynaecologic and genitourinary malignancies. For local recurrences, irradiation with IORT is besides brachytherapy the only radiotherapeutic option if repeated EBRT is no longer possible. Generally, the normal tissue tolerance does not allow a second full-dose course of EBRT, even after years.|$|E

The {{aim of the}} study was to assess clinical, pathological and treatment-related factors affecting prognosis in patients with <b>retroperitoneal</b> <b>sarcomas.</b> METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: The hospital records of 73 patients who underwent surgical exploration at our unit for primary <b>retroperitoneal</b> <b>sarcomas</b> between 1984 and 2003 were reviewed. Factors influencing overall and disease-free survival were analyzed for all patients and for those who underwent complete surgical resection. RESULTS: The complete resectability rate was 69. 8 % (51 / 73). Operative mortality and morbidity rates were 2. 7 % and 21. 9 %, respectively. For patients who underwent complete resection, the 5 -year survival rate was 58. 3 %, whereas it was 0 % in cases of incomplete or no resection (P < 0. 001). Local recurrence rate was 37. 2 %.

30|$|<b>Retroperitoneal</b> <b>sarcomas</b> {{are rare}} tumours, {{and a number}} of subtypes may occur, the most common of which are liposarcoma and Leiomyosarcoma [50].

As such, retroperitoneal space involvement carries a poor prognosis, as does tumour grade [51, 52].

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the treatment outcome and prognostic factor after postoperative radiotherapy in <b>retroperitoneal</b> <b>sarcoma.</b> Materials and Methods: Forty patients {{were treated with}} surgical resection and postoperative radiotherapy for <b>retroperitoneal</b> <b>sarcoma</b> from August 1990 to August 2008. Treatment volume was judged by the location of initial tumor and surgical field, and 45 - 50 Gy of radiation was basically delivered and additional dose was considered to the high-risk area. Results: The median follow-up period was 41. 4 months (range, 3. 9 to 140. 6 months). The 5 -year overall survival (OS) was 51. 8 % and disease free survival was 31. 5 %. The 5 -year locoregional recurrence free survival was 61. 9 % and distant metastasis free survival was 50. 6 %. In univariate analysis, histologic type (p = 0. 006) was the strongest prognostic factor for the OS and histologic grade (p = 0. 044) or resection margin (p = 0. 032) had also effect on the OS.

Forty-one consecutive {{patients with}} localized <b>retroperitoneal</b> <b>sarcoma</b> were retrospectively studied. Results. Median age was 58 years (range 20 – 91 years). Median tumor size was 17. 5 [*]cm (range 4 – 41 [*]cm). Only 2 tumors were < 5 [*]cm. Most were liposarcoma (44 %) and high-grade (59 %). 59 % were stage 3 {{and the rest}} was stage 1.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{identified}} prognostic factors {{relevant to}} clinical outcomes (especially survival) in truncal and retroperitoneal soft-tissue sarcoma. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: These {{results can be}} used to optimize surgical management and select patients most likely to benefit from novel therapeutic strategies in future trials. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of a prospectively compiled database of 183 consecutive patients with truncal and retroperitoneal sarcomas seen at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute between 1970 to 1994. RESULTS: For truncal sarcoma, multivariate analysis showed that high-grade histology was associated with an eightfold increased risk of death compared with low-grade histology (p = 0. 001). In addition to grade, gross positive margin of resection (p = 0. 001), microscopic positive margin (p = 0. 023), and tumors greater than 5 cm in size (p = 0. 018) were important independent prognostic factors for survival. In this series, postoperative radiation therapy for truncal sarcoma was associated with a 2. 4 -fold decreased risk of death compared with truncal sarcoma patients receiving no adjuvant radiation therapy, having adjusted for the other prognostic factors (p = 0. 030). In contrast, for <b>retroperitoneal</b> <b>sarcoma,</b> multivariate analysis showed that high-grade and intermediate-grade histology were associated with a five- to sixfold increased risk of death compared with low-grade histology (p = 0. 009). In addition to grade, gross positive margin of resection (p = 0. 001) and microscopic positive margin (p = 0. 004) were important independent prognostic factors for survival in <b>retroperitoneal</b> <b>sarcoma.</b> Patients who received either preoperative or postoperative chemotherapy for <b>retroperitoneal</b> <b>sarcoma</b> had a 4. 6 -fold (p = 0. 002) and 3 -fold (p = 0. 010) increased risk of death, respectively, compared with patients receiving no adjuvant chemotherapy, having adjusted for the other prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: The histologic grade and the margin of resection are prognostic for survival in both truncal and retroperitoneal soft-tissue sarcoma. Tumor size was an independent prognostic factor for truncal sarcoma, but not for <b>retroperitoneal</b> <b>sarcoma.</b> Postoperative adjuvant radiation was beneficial to overall survival for truncal sarcoma.
