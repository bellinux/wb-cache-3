Received; in {{original}} form We have produced brightness and magnetic field {{maps of the}} surfaces of CV Cha and CR Cha: two actively accreting G and K-type T Tauri stars in the Chamaeleon I star-forming cloud with ages of 3 - 5 Myr. Our magnetic field maps show evidence for strong, complex multi-polar fields similar to those obtained for young rapidly <b>rotating</b> <b>main</b> sequence stars. Brightness maps indicate the presence of dark polar caps and low latitude spots – these brightness maps {{are very similar to}} those obtained for other pre-main sequence and rapidly <b>rotating</b> <b>main</b> sequence stars. Only two other classical T Tauri stars have been studied using similar techniques so far: V 2129 Oph and BP Tau. CV Cha and CR Cha show magnetic field patterns that are significantly more complex than those recovered for BP Tau, a fully convective T Tauri star. We discuss possible reasons for this difference and suggest that the complexity of the stellar magnetic field is related to the convection zone; with more comple...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{new kind}} of {{numerical}} control system is presented in this paper. The <b>main</b> <b>movement</b> of the numerical control system {{is driven by the}} traditional power, such as hand wheel or hydraulic power, the movement is detected by an grating detector, or other detect devices and the displacement of the <b>main</b> <b>movement</b> is input to a computer simultaneously. finally the computer drives the other axis to move immediately, according to the preset program or rule. In this way, the NC system, for example, NC machining tool, can realize any kind of complex and powerful cutting or manufacturing at higher maching speed than other machines. With the higher power and speed servomotor or servo system expansiving, this system will fulfill working task with higher productivity and lower cost...|$|R

However, it is clearly necessary to conduct magnetic field studies of T Tauri star systems, exploring a wide range of stellar parameters in order to establish how they affect magnetic field generation, and thus how these magnetic fields are likely to affect the evolution of T Tauri star systems as they approach the main sequence.
