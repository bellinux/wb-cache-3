2500|$|On April 23, 2014, Ellsbury {{played his}} first game at Fenway Park since leaving the Boston Red Sox to join the New York Yankees. He {{received}} an ovation of boos from Red Sox fans. In his first season with the Yankees, Ellsbury hit [...]271 with 16 home runs and 39 stolen bases. He remained healthy {{for most of the}} season, playing in 149 games, the third-most games he has ever played in one season. Ellsbury's home <b>run</b> <b>count</b> was the second-highest of his career next to his 2011 season.|$|E
2500|$|Pitchers {{eventually}} {{learned to}} adjust. They threw outside to right-handed hitters, {{requiring them to}} pull hard for the left-field fence, and as at the Polo Grounds, a deep fence in right center (...) challenged lefties, and {{over the course of}} the season the home <b>run</b> <b>count</b> at the Coliseum declined to the same level as other National League parks. At the end of the season, The Sporting News noted, there had been only 21 more home runs in the Coliseum than there were in the smaller Ebbets Field, where the Dodgers had played in Brooklyn. During the off-season, Frick announced a rule change stipulating that any new stadium built for major-league play must have all its fences at least [...] from home plate. This was widely viewed as a response to the preseason controversy.|$|E
50|$|In general, for an {{even number}} N working files, each {{iteration}} of an ordinary merge sort reduces <b>run</b> <b>count</b> {{by a factor of}} N/2, or for an odd number O working files, each iteration reduces the <b>run</b> <b>count</b> by an average factor of square_root((O2-1)/4).|$|E

50|$|If {{there are}} only three working files, then an {{ordinary}} merge sort merges sorted runs from two working files onto a single working file, then distributes the runs evenly between the two output files. The merge iteration reduces <b>run</b> <b>count</b> by a factor of 2, the redistribute iteration doesn't reduce <b>run</b> <b>count</b> (the factor is 1). Each iteration could be considered to reduce the <b>run</b> <b>count</b> by an average factor of the square root of 2 ~= 1.41. If there are 5 working files, then the pattern alternates between a 3 way merge and a 2 way merge, for an average factor of square root of 6 ~= 2.45.|$|E

50|$|For each {{polyphase}} iteration, {{the total}} number of runs follows a pattern similar to a reversed Fibonacci numbers of higher order sequence. With 4 files, and a dataset consisting of 57 runs, the total <b>run</b> <b>count</b> on each iteration would be 57, 31, 17, 9, 5, 3, 1. Note that except for the last iteration, the <b>run</b> <b>count</b> reduction factor is a bit less than 2, 57/31, 31/17, 17/9, 9/5, 5/3, 3/1, about 1.84 for a 4 file case, but each iteration except the last reduced the <b>run</b> <b>count</b> while processing about 65% of the dataset, so the <b>run</b> <b>count</b> reduction factor per dataset processed during the intermediate iterations is about 1.84 / 0.65 = 2.83. For a dataset consisting of 57 runs of 1 record each, then after the initial distribution, polyphase merge sort moves 232 records during the 6 iterations it takes to sort the dataset, for an overall reduction factor of 2.70 (this is explained in more detail later).|$|E

50|$|Langton {{was born}} at Parkgate, Rotherham, Yorkshire. He made his debut for Derbyshire in the 1909 season in June in a match against Leicestershire and made one more {{appearance}} during the season, making little contribution to Derbyshire's <b>run</b> <b>count</b> during the season. He played one game in the 1910 season against Sussex {{when he made his}} top scoring innings of 6 runs. He was a right-handed batsman and played 5 innings in 3 matches with a top score of 6 and an average of 2.80. He bowled 13 overs giving 42 runs for no wickets.|$|E

50|$|Al Ain FC {{won their}} 12th UAE Arabian Gulf League title in season 2014-15 UAE Pro-League which they secured three rounds {{before the end}} of the league. At the {{official}} end of the league, on 11 May they had 11 points more than runners-up Al Jazira Club and Al Shabab (Dubai). They have only lost two games in the whole season which means they were unbeaten in 23 league matches with an imposing goal difference of +43. In this season they took few achievements in the league - they have conceded the least goals, they had the longest unbeaten <b>run</b> <b>counting</b> 15 matches, longest winning <b>run</b> <b>counting</b> 8 matches and biggest home win versus Ajman Club 7-1.|$|R
5000|$|An unearned <b>run</b> <b>counts</b> {{just as much}} as {{any other}} run for the purpose of {{determining}} the score of the game. However, it is [...] "unearned" [...] in that it was, in a sense, [...] "given away" [...] by the defensive team.|$|R

5000|$|Hogg {{was born}} in Pentrich, the son of John Hogg, a coal miner and his wife Ann. He made his first {{appearance}} for Derbyshire during the 1905 season in a match against Lancashire when he scored a single run in his first innings of a drawn match. His next game was in the 1906 season against Surrey in July, when he scored a career-best of 4 in the second innings. His final game was later that season against Yorkshire {{when he did not}} score in either innings. Derbyshire lost both those matches. Hogg was a right-handed batsman and played 6 innings in 3 first-class matches with a total <b>run</b> <b>count</b> of 5.|$|E
5000|$|Straight rail became {{progressively}} more popular and skill {{in the game}} increased commensurately. For example, Albert Garnier, author of Scientific Billiards (1880) and the champion {{of the first world}} title straight rail tournament in 1873, averaged 12 points {{over the course of the}} competition and posted a high run of 113. Although unimpressive compared with later records (in 1931 legendary player Charlie Peterson achieved an astounding 10,232 high <b>run</b> <b>count),</b> the many-fold increase in scoring average and high run as compared with the 1855 contest was a result of refinement of gather shots and, most importantly, the development of a variety of [...] "nurse" [...] techniques (also called nursery cannons in the UK).|$|E
50|$|The initial {{production}} <b>run</b> <b>counted</b> ten helicopters {{of which}} the first three were used for development, testing and airworthiness tests. The second production run of ten helicopters was undertaken by Aviolanda after Kromhout left the joint venture. This second production run was to be equipped with an uprated ramjet. It is unsure whether the improved ramjet was ever produced.|$|R
50|$|If the batsman {{hits the}} ball, {{he or she}} must <b>run.</b> A <b>run</b> <b>counts</b> if the batsman taps one of the stumps with his bat and runs back to his batting position. Some rule sets {{stipulate}} that the batsman must run around the stump. By convention, but not usually by rule, the batsman alternates between runs to the left and right.|$|R
50|$|MacPhail thus {{restored}} Brett's {{home run}} {{and ordered the}} game resumed with two outs {{in the top of}} the ninth inning with the Royals leading 5-4. Although MacPhail ruled that Brett's home <b>run</b> <b>counted,</b> he retroactively ejected Brett for his outburst against McClelland. Howser and coach Rocky Colavito were also ejected for arguing with the umpires, and Perry was ejected for giving the bat to the batboy so he could hide it in the clubhouse.|$|R
50|$|After {{the wall}} was painted green in 1947, {{advertisements}} did not appear on the wall until 1999, when the All-Star Game at Fenway was being promoted. Various ads have appeared above the scoreboard since then, such as the Jimmy Fund, W.B. Mason, and Granite City Electric. The Coke Bottles on the left light tower were a target for power-hitters when they were placed in 1997. These 3D advertisements were taken down before the 2008 season, when an LED sign was built above the new left-field upper deck seats. As a lead up to his 500th career home run, Manny Ramirez's home <b>run</b> <b>count</b> was tallied {{on the bottom of}} the light tower. Ads beside the manual scoreboard were added when the scoreboard was expanded. Above the manual scoreboard, where a Jimmy Fund advertisement had remained for many years, the logo for Covidien is now a prominent aspect of Fenway Park. Outside of Fenway in Kenmore Square, but able to be seen in the view above the left-field wall, is the Boston Citgo sign.|$|E
50|$|For N {{less than}} 8 working files, a {{polyphase}} merge sort achieves a higher effective <b>run</b> <b>count</b> reduction factor by unevenly distributing sorted runs between N-1 working files (explained in next section). Each iteration merges runs from N-1 working files onto a single output working file. When {{the end of}} one of the N-1 working files is reached, then it becomes the new output file and what was the output file becomes one of the N-1 working input files, starting a new iteration of polyphase merge sort. Each iteration merges {{only a fraction of the}} dataset (about 1/2 to 3/4), except for the last iteration which merges all of the dataset into a single sorted run. The initial distribution is set up so that only one input working file is emptied at a time, except for the final merge iteration which merges N-1 single runs (of varying size, this is explained next) from the N-1 input working files to the single output file, resulting in a single sorted run, the sorted dataset.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the first}} {{polyphase}} iteration, {{what was the}} output file now contains the results of merging N-1 original runs, but the remaining N-2 input working files still contain the remaining original runs, so the second merge iteration produces runs of size (N-1) + (N-2) = (2N - 3) original runs. The third iteration produces runs of size (4N - 7) original runs. With 4 files, the first iteration creates runs of size 3 original runs, the second iteration 5 original runs, the third iteration 9 original runs and so on, following the Fibonacci like pattern, 1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, 57, ... so the increase in run size follows the same pattern as the decrease in <b>run</b> <b>count</b> in reverse. In the example case of 4 files and 57 runs of 1 record each, the last iteration merges 3 runs of size 31, 17, 9, resulting in a single sorted run of size 31+17+9 = 57 records, the sorted dataset. An example of the run counts and run sizes for 4 files, 31 records {{can be found in}} table 4.3 of.|$|E
50|$|This {{marked the}} demise of {{professional}} straight rail in the U.S., which only had a six year run from 1873 to 1879. Meanwhile, straight rail professional play continued in Europe, with high <b>run</b> <b>counts</b> consistently climbing. Frenchman Maurice Vignaux posted a 1,531 count in Paris in 1880, while American George Spears had a high run of 5,041 in 1890. Later runs of over 10,000, {{in addition to the}} one previously noted, have been accurately reported.|$|R
