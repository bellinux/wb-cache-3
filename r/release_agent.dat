25|$|Being inexpensively {{available}} and chemically benign, stearic acid finds many niche applications, for example, in making plaster castings from a plaster piece mold or waste mold and {{in making the}} mold from a shellacked clay original. In this use, powdered stearic acid is mixed in water and the suspension is brushed onto the surface to be parted after casting. This reacts with the calcium in the plaster to form {{a thin layer of}} calcium stearate, which functions as a <b>release</b> <b>agent.</b> When reacted with zinc it forms zinc stearate, which is used as a lubricant for playing cards (fanning powder) to ensure a smooth motion when fanning. In compressed confections, it is used as a lubricant to keep the tablet from sticking to the die.|$|E
2500|$|Metal-catalyzed {{reactions}} of NO are not commonly synthetically useful. [...] Nitric oxide is however an important signalling molecule {{in nature and}} this fact {{is the basis of}} the most important applications of metal nitrosyls. The nitroprusside anion, 2âˆ’, a mixed nitrosyl cyano complex, has pharmaceutical applications as a slow <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> for NO. [...] The signalling function of NO is effected via its complexation to haeme proteins, where it binds in the bent geometry.|$|E
2500|$|Asphalt is {{typically}} stored and transported at temperatures around [...] Sometimes diesel oil or kerosene are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity; upon delivery, these lighter materials are separated {{out of the}} mixture. This mixture is often called [...] "bitumen feedstock", or BFS. Some dump trucks route the hot engine exhaust through pipes in the dump body to keep the material warm. The backs of tippers carrying asphalt, {{as well as some}} handling equipment, are also commonly sprayed with a releasing agent before filling to aid release. Diesel oil is no longer used as a <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> due to environmental concerns.|$|E

50|$|Like amphetamines, cathinone, and ephedrine, cathine {{acts as a}} {{norepinephrine}} <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> (NRA). It also acts as a dopamine <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> (DRA) to {{a lesser}} extent.|$|R
50|$|No {{selective}} DRAs {{are currently}} known. Many <b>releasing</b> <b>agents</b> of both dopamine and norepinephrine (norepinephrine-dopamine <b>releasing</b> <b>agents,</b> or NDRAs) and of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine are known (serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine <b>releasing</b> <b>agents,</b> or SNDRAs), however. Examples of NDRAs include amphetamine and methamphetamine, and {{an example of}} an SNDRA is MDMA. These drugs are frequently encountered as drugs of abuse.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the plug}} has been formed, it is sprayed with a mold <b>release</b> <b>agent.</b> The <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> {{will allow the}} mold to be {{separated}} from the plug once it is finished. The mold <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> is a special wax, and/or PVA (Polyvinyl alcohol). Polyvinyl Alcohol, however, is said to have negative effects on the final mold's surface finish.|$|E

5000|$|Release agents {{provide the}} {{critical}} barrier between a molding {{surface and the}} substrate, facilitating separation of the cured part from the mold. Without such a barrier in place the substrate would become fused to the mold surface, resulting in difficult clean-up and dramatic loss in production efficiency. Even when a <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> is used, factors such as irregular applications or improper <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> choice may have a dramatic effect on the quality and consistency of the finished product.|$|E
50|$|Fenfluramine {{acts as a}} {{serotonin}} <b>releasing</b> <b>agent,</b> phentermine as {{primarily a}} norepinephrine <b>releasing</b> <b>agent.</b> Phentermine also induces the release of serotonin and dopamine, although to a far lesser extent than it induces the release of norepinephrine.|$|R
50|$|Methedrone induces the {{transportation}} mediated release of NE, DA and 5-HT from cells preloaded with monoamines {{making it a}} serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine (SNDRA) <b>releasing</b> <b>agent,</b> also known as triple <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> (TRA), which is a common characteristic among drugs of abuse.|$|R
50|$|In the {{concrete}} construction industry, form <b>release</b> <b>agents</b> prevent the adhesion of freshly placed concrete to the forming surface, usually plywood, overlaid plywood, steel or aluminum.

5000|$|Carnauba wax {{may be used}} as a mold <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> for {{manufacture}} of fibre-reinforced plastics. An aerosol mold <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> is formed by dissolving carnauba wax in a solvent. Unlike silicone or PTFE, carnauba is suitable for use with liquid epoxy, epoxy molding compounds (EMC), and some other plastic types and generally enhances their properties [...] Carnauba wax is not very soluble in chlorinated or aromatic hydrocarbons.Carnauba is used in melt/castable explosives to produce an insensitive explosive formula such as Composition B, which is a blend of RDX and TNT.|$|E
50|$|A {{release liner}} is a paper (or film) sheet {{used to prevent}} a sticky surface from adhering. It is coated on one or both sides with a <b>release</b> <b>agent.</b>|$|E
50|$|A serotonin-norepinephrine-{{dopamine}} <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> (SNDRA), {{also known}} as a triple <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> (TRA), is a type of drug which induces the release of serotonin, norepinephrine/epinephrine, and dopamine in the brain and body. SNDRAs produce euphoriant, entactogen, and psychostimulant effects, and are almost exclusively encountered as recreational drugs.|$|R
5000|$|A {{serotonin}} <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> (SRA) {{is a type}} of {{drug that}} induces the release of serotonin into the neuronal synaptic cleft. A selective serotonin <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> (SSRA) is an SRA with less significant or no efficacy in producing neurotransmitter [...] at other types of monoamine neurons.|$|R
50|$|Its {{structure}} {{incorporates the}} backbone of amphetamine, the prototypical CNS stimulant which, like phenmetrazine, is a <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> of dopamine and norepinephrine. The molecule also loosely resembles ethcathinone, the active metabolite of popular anorectic amfepramone (diethylpropion). Unlike phenmetrazine, ethcathinone (and therefore amfepramone as well) are mostly selective as noradrenaline <b>releasing</b> <b>agents.</b>|$|R
5000|$|It is {{also used}} in process {{industries}} as <b>release</b> <b>agent,</b> antistatic agent and antifoaming agent {{for the production of}} thermoplastics, wiring, and paper. [...] It is used in powder metallurgy.|$|E
5000|$|A {{release liner}} is a paper or plastic-based film sheet (usually applied during the {{manufacturing}} process) {{used to prevent}} a sticky surface from prematurely adhering. It is coated on one or both sides with a <b>release</b> <b>agent,</b> which provides a release effect against any type of a sticky material such as an adhesive or a mastic. Release liners are available in different colors, with or without printing under the low surface energy coating or on the backside of the liner. Release is separation of the liner from a sticky material; liner is the carrier for the <b>release</b> <b>agent.</b>|$|E
50|$|Once {{the plug}} has its <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> applied, gelcoat is applied with a roller, brush or specially-designed spray gun. The gelcoat is {{pigmented}} resin, {{and gives the}} mold surface a harder, more durable finish.|$|E
