40|$|Abstract. The Sindice Semantic Web index {{provides}} search capabilities over {{today more}} than 30 million documents. A scalable reasoning mechanism for real-world web data {{is important in}} order to increase the precision and <b>recall</b> <b>of</b> the Sindice <b>index</b> by inferring useful information (e. g. RDF Schema features, equality, property characteristic such as inverse functional properties or annotation properties from OWL). In this paper, we introduce our notion of context dependent reasoning for RDF documents published on the Web according to the linked data principle. We then illustrate an efficient methodology to perform context dependent RDFS and partial OWL inference based on a persistent TBox composed of a network of web ontologies. Finally we report preliminary evaluation results of our implementation underlying the Sindice web data index. ...|$|R

The new word list was intended to be easier, with less geographic, cultural and socioeconomic bias. The 'grocery shopping list' has been dropped in favour of an empirically-driven word list composed of words from four unrelated semantic categories. A nine-word short form has also been introduced to improve the utility of the test in assessment of patients with severe cognitive dysfunction.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} the memory {{retrieval}} mechanism in an artificial neural network and suggest an algorithm to increase the memory retrieval rate in the B-Matrix neural network. B-matrix is a model <b>of</b> <b>recall</b> by <b>index,</b> where in the activity spreads locally. The B-matrix approach to neural network function accounts for spreading of activity from one region to others based on adjacency of neurons. We propose an algorithm to increase the memory retrieval rate by identifying the inactive nodes in the network and applying Widrow-Hoff learning function to the weighted matrix. We made an attempt to implement the concept of synaptic plasticity in the artificial neural networks to increase the retrieval rate of the network. The change in the state of neurons is also analyzed after the learning algorithm is applied to the network. 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} methods for {{estimating}} premorbid intelligence were compared in an Australian sample participating in the Macquarie University Neuropsychological Normative Study (MUNNS). Predictors included a contextual version of the AUSNART, the WRAT- 3 Reading subtest, Spot-the-Word Test and sub-tests from the WAIS-R. The study involved 244 healthy participants aged between 18 and 34 years, with half of them serving as a cross-validation sample. Multiple regression was used for all analyses. When taking into account both the statistical results and clinical utility of the methods, the Sydney Premorbid Intelligence Estimate (SPIE), consisting of Vocabulary and Picture Completion subtests from the WAIS-R, {{was considered to be}} the best predictor.

40|$|Recently, new {{findings}} {{allow us to}} suggest that lifelong exposure to endogenous estrogens could be a reliable predictor {{of the effect of}} exogenous estrogens on cognition and the brain. Thus explaining why women do not arrive at menopause with an equivalent susceptibility to the effects of estrogen therapy (ET) In the current thesis, studies have been designed to investigate the effect of estrogens on the brain from a new perspective by introducing new measures. Firstly, we developed a questionnaire about <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> lifelong estrogen exposure and assessed the reliability <b>of</b> these self-reported <b>indices</b> over a four year interval. Secondly, we recruited postmenopausal women and men to investigate the effects of estrogens on the brain using magnetic resonance imaging. Volumetric analyses of the hippocampus and amygdala and global automated analysis using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) were performed to assess whether current ET use as well as estrogen exposure throughout life can predict cerebral structural changes. The results demonstrate that most lifelong estrogen exposure indices were reliable with age at menopause and age at HT initiation leading to the weaker correlations. An age effect on the <b>recall</b> <b>of</b> these <b>indices</b> was also observed. The neuroimaging results revealed that women using ET had larger HC volumes compared to past HT users, never users and men. Moreover, we found a negative relationship between ET duration and HC volume among ET users. We confirmed these results with the VBM analysis. These results support the notion that there is a treatment duration-dependent neuroprotective role of estrogen on HC volume in aging that point toward a window of opportunity. Analysing the whole brain using VBM also demonstrated that there are sex differences and that the estrogen effects are not specific to the HC since we found that ET users compared to never users have greater grey matter concentration in the nucleus accumbens and that this effect was modulated by age at menarche and age at menopause. Overall, these results strongly suggest that lifelong endogenous and exogenous estrogen exposures have modulatory neuroprotective effect on the aging brain...|$|R

Objective : To develop a reliable measure of walking – undertaken within and outside the neighborhood – and overall physical activity. Methods : A test–retest reliability study was undertaken (n = 82, mean age 39 years). The instrument was based on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-short version) and Active Australia Survey. It measured usual frequency and duration of (1) recreational- and transport-related walking within and outside the neighborhood and (2) other vigorous and moderate physical activities. Results : Reliability <b>of</b> <b>recall</b> <b>of</b> whether participants had walked within (k = 0. 84) and outside (0. 73) the neighborhood was acceptable. Similarly, <b>recall</b> <b>of</b> frequency and duration of transport and recreational-related walking within the neighborhood was excellent (ICC ≥ 0. 82), as was <b>recall</b> <b>of</b> transport-related walking trips outside the neighborhood (ICC ≥ 0. 84).

40|$|With the {{hypothesis}} that depression affects memory through a mechanism other {{than that of the}} benzodiazepines, the present study evaluated the acute effect of diazepam 10 mg upon explicit memory in patients with major depression. A double-blind, placebo (starch 50 mg) controlled experiment was carried out with 19 patients randomly divided into diazepam (n = 10) and placebo (n = 9) groups. They were evaluated by the Mini-Mental State Examination, and tests were conducted for immediate and delayed (short-term) memory with emotionally toned stimuli (negative, positive, neutral), recognition, and semantic memory in visual or auditory modality. The Visual Analog Mood scale (VAMS) was applied to measure anxiety and mood changes after the administration of drugs (30 minutes and 6 hours). Higher scores in the positively toned list among patients who received diazepam were observed, at the 30 -minute compared with the 6 -hour evaluation. The <b>recall</b> <b>index</b> <b>of</b> positive words in the diazepam group was positive and significantly different from the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> the placebo group. No anterograde amnesia following diazepam was observed. The neural model of a dysfunction of limbic prefrontal cortical structures that impairs the modulation of the amygdala in major depression may explain the present results. Consequently, the action of diazepam on the amygdala, which has been proposed to be the basis of its anxiolytic action, might be altered, modifying the modulation of memory in our patients...|$|R
