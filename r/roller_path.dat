50|$|Flow Forming is an {{incremental}} metal forming technique {{in which a}} disk or tube of metal is formed over a mandrel {{by one or more}} rollers using tremendous pressure. The roller deforms the workpiece, forcing it against the mandrel, both axially lengthening and radially thinning it. Since the pressure exerted by the roller is highly localized and the material is incrementally formed, often there is a net savings in energy in forming over drawing or ironing processes. However, these savings are often not realized because of the inherent difficulties in predicting the resulting deformation for a given <b>roller</b> <b>path.</b> Flow forming subjects the workpiece to a great deal of friction and deformation. These two factors may heat the workpiece to several hundred degrees if proper cooling fluid is not utilized.|$|E

The remainder of the bridge foundations consisted of cast iron piers fitted with cutting shoes sunk by excavation by hand labour working in airlocks, and by weighting. Piers for the swing span consisted of eight cast iron cylinders tapering from 6 to 4.5 ft diameter from base to top which surrounded a ninth cylinder of 7 ft base diameter; the [...] wall width cylinders were sunk {{to the level of}} sandstone bedrock at a depth of around 78 ft; after which they were filled with concrete. The central river pier had similar foundations of two 8 ft cast iron piers braced together. The swing span turntable consisted of 29 ft diameter steel conical roller paths and bearings, supported on a circular 20 in deep box girder in eight sections, with a twelve section box girder above, supporting the superstructure. The bridge turned about a central heavy cast pivot, with ties to the upper and lower box girders, and to the bearings. The bridge superstructure was constructed of wrought iron plate girders, with an asymmetric 'hogback' shape; the swing span extremities were 45 and 85 ft from the centre line, with a 92.45 LT counterweight; the maximum web depth was 14.5 ft. The fixed span was of similar, but symmetrical construction. The bridge was turned by the reaction of a rotating vertical shaft on a rack on the lower <b>roller</b> <b>path.</b> Power was supplied hydraulically from an accumulator (charged by steam engine power) near the railway station, via underground concentric pressure and return pipes in the central swing span pier - driving a pair of three cylinder hydraulic engines located in the cabin. Accumulators and steam engines were duplicated. The locking mechanism for the bridge was also hydraulically powered. As a consequence of the realignment of track resulting from the resiting of the bridge the station at Selby was also partially reconstructed.|$|E

40|$|Sheet metal {{spinning}} {{is one of}} the metal forming processes, where a flat metal blank is rotated at a high speed and formed into an axisymmetric part by a roller which gradually forces the blank onto a mandrel, bearing the final shape of the spun part. Over the last few decades, sheet {{metal spinning}} has developed significantly and spun products have been widely used in various industries. Although the spinning process has already been known for centuries, the process design still highly relies on experienced spinners using trial-and-error. Challenges remain to achieve high product dimensional accuracy and prevent material failures. This PhD project aims to gain insight into the material deformation and wrinkling failure mechanics in the conventional spinning process by employing experimental and numerical methods. In this study, a tool compensation technique has been proposed and used to develop CNC multiple <b>roller</b> <b>path</b> (passes). 3 -D elastic-plastic Finite Element (FE) models have been developed to analyse the material deformation and wrinkling failure of the spinning process. By combining these two techniques in the process design, the time and materials wasted by using the trial-and-error could be decreased significantly. In addition, it may provide a practical approach of standardised operation for the spinning industry and thus improve the product quality, process repeatability and production efficiency. Furthermore, effects of process parameters, e. g. <b>roller</b> <b>path</b> profiles, feed rate and spindle speed, on the variations of tool forces, stresses, strains, wall thickness and wrinkling failures have also been investigated. Using a concave <b>roller</b> <b>path</b> produces high tool forces, stresses and reduction of wall thickness. Conversely, low tool forces, stresses and wall thinning have been obtained in the FE model which uses the convex <b>roller</b> <b>path.</b> High feed ratios help to maintain original blank thickness but also lead to material failures and rough surface finish. Thus it is necessary to find a “trade off” feed ratio for a spinning process design...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{design and}} {{development}} of a <b>roller</b> <b>path</b> and control have been mainly performed by the expert’s experience in the Roll-to-Roll (R 2 R) system. There are some important issues in the numerical analysis method of R 2 R system. This study proposes an efficient R 2 R system analysis method. The first one is the Approximated Winding Length Estimation (AWLE) algorithm which can calculate the analytic winded length of the workpiece. The core winder is approximated with line and arc segments in this algorithm. As a result, in the numerical model of R 2 R system, we can replace the winder characteristics with the approximated winding length estimation (AWLE) algorithm. The second one is the contact algorithm between workpiece and rollers...|$|E
40|$|Growers who use {{cover crops}} are {{increasingly}} {{turning to a}} tool that can flatten out their actively growing fields, usually in a single pass. Known as a “roller/ crimper,” the technology can help reduce and sometimes {{eliminate the need for}} herbicides and is ideal for organic farmers and growers interested in reducing herbicide use. Cover crops can improve soil quality; and in organic operations, they {{play a major role in}} keeping weeds in check. Crimpers boost those benefits. They have been used for years in South America and are beginning to catch on in the United States, says Ted Kornecki, an agricultural engineer at the Agricultural Research Service’s National Soil Dynamics Laboratory in Auburn, Alabama. He has conducted a study evaluating several crimpers to give guidance to growers and has patented three crimper designs. There are several types of crimpers. Most involve some type of rolling, paddlewheel- like cylinder that attaches to a tractor and barrels over a field, tamping down and crimping the cover crop into a smooth mat to kill it. About 3 weeks later, a planter, running parallel to the <b>roller’s</b> <b>path,</b> can plant seeds directly into the ground without significantly disturbing the biomass mat. The technology has shown promise in early trials and demonstrations. “It definitely works,” says Frank Randle, who helped evaluate a crimper similar to one designed by Kornecki as part of a 4 -year demonstration project on his farm near Auburn. Randle used cereal rye and crimson clover as cover crops before planting organic watermelon, squash, okra, and tomatoes. The clover was difficult to kill with the crimper, but the device terminated the rye effectively. After the 4 th year, Randle did have to till the plots to control some perennial weeds, but the crimper could be used again continuously for years after that...|$|R

30|$|As {{a special}} type of {{conventional}} spinning process, DRCS should be studied to reveal its deformation mechanism. Thus, the authors used two methods to establish FE model of DRCS for a cylinder with a rectangular flange. The first method {{is the same}} as that for actual working conditions, where the workpiece rotates around its own axis. The second method makes the workpiece motionless, unlike in the actual forming process. Different methods may be chosen according to the different computing conditions [26]. To save computing time, the authors used the second method to establish an FE model of the DRCS, and solved key problems in establishing the model, such as the expression of the complex <b>roller</b> <b>path,</b> meshing, the clamping position for the internal expanding clamp, and the location of the bending point. Then, a precise three-dimensional elasticoplastic FE model was established for DRCS, and the FE model was verified by experiments [27]. Moreover, the authors carried out experimental research and many FE simulations and obtained the effects of main process parameters, such as the roller radius, the spacing between two rollers and the feed rate of rollers on the DRCS process [28].|$|E
40|$|The {{kinematics}} of {{the deep}} rolling tool, contact stress, and induced residual stress in the near-surface material of a flat Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy plate are numerically investigated. The deep rolling tool is under multiaxis nonlinear motion in the process. Unlike available deep rolling simulations in the open literature, the roller motion investigated in this study includes penetrative and slightly translational motions. A three-dimensional finite element model with dynamic explicit technique is developed to simulate the instantaneous complex roller motions during the deep rolling process. The initial motion of the rollers followed by the penetration motion to apply the load and perform the deep rolling process, the load releasing, and material recovery steps is sequentially simulated. This model is able to capture the transient characteristics of the kinematics on the roller and contacts between the roller and the plate due to variations of roller motion. The predictions show that the magnitude of roller reaction force in the penetration direction starts to decrease with time when the roller motion changes to the deep rolling step and the residual stress distributions in the near-surface material after the material recovery step varies considerably along the <b>roller</b> <b>path...</b>|$|E
30|$|Conventional {{spinning}} is a single-roller spinning process. Because {{only one}} roller is used, {{one side of}} the sheet metal bears severe asymmetrical spinning force, which can easily cause wrinkling. And point contact between the single roller and sheet metal causes very small plastic deformation after each spinning pass, which leads to more spinning passes and low production efficiency. Furthermore, conventional single-roller spinning requires the use of different sizes of rollers for different materials, shapes, and sizes of spun parts. These rollers have complex surface profiles, terrible stress conditions, low life cycled, and high manufacturing costs. In contrast, the new DRCS process uses two cylinder rollers with simple shapes and low costs to symmetrically clamp the sheet metal which bears compressive stress. Because there is sufficient pressure in the thickness direction, {{it is not easy to}} cause sheet wrinkling, and the spun parts have high dimensional accuracy. In contrast with conventional spinning, the DRCS process involves line contact between the rollers and sheet metal. Thus, the loading action area is larger than that in conventional spinning, and the plastic deformation in each spinning pass is larger. Consequently spinning efficiency is higher. In addition, in the DRCS process, the shape of the final parts is determined by the <b>roller</b> <b>path,</b> not by the profile of the mandrel, which is different from conventional spinning processes. That is, DRCS is a dieless, flexible spinning process that can be used to produce a variety of shapes of flanges, including rectangular flanges.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development and validation of interactive computer software that aids the design procedures for cam mechanism design, thereby facilitating the optimised design of the mechanism. Attention is focussed on the disc cam-translating roller follower mechanism with respect to which a series of analytical programs have been developed which addresses the design of the complete mechanism. This broad view of the mechanism design as opposed to concentrating on specific features thereof as has hitherto been the case, has been a major objective of the work reported in this thesis. Each analytical program shows the means adopted to satisfy the limiting conditions imposed by kinematic constraints and strength limitations encountered in cam design. The software enables the establishment of the design specification for the manufacture of the cam itself along with as much data on the other features of the mechanism (i. e. the spring, follower, and roller on follower) as project time could permit. A typical run of the software is shown, with the results presented in graphical as well as tabular format.

40|$|Purpose. About one of {{the causes}} of slip rolling is known from {{the second half of the}} 19 th century, it was {{believed}} that the slip resistance appears at the place of contact due to different speeds on the arc of contact. Only in the mid- 20 th century it was proved that this resistance is negligible in rolling resistance. However (for some unknown reason) it is ignored the fact that in practice in rolling bearings may rotate both the inner ring with a stationary outer one, and vice versa almost in equal relations. It is not taken into account the fact that the ball or roller in the rolling bearings runs the different distance along the <b>roller</b> <b>path</b> of the outer and inner bearing cages in one revolution. This fact is not taken into account in determining the calculated values for the friction coefficient of a rolling bearing reduced to the shaft. Therefore, the aim of this work is to determine the influence of path length on the track riding the outer and inner race of the bearing on the determination of the calculated value of the coefficient of friction of rolling bearings is given to the shaft. Methodology. The solution technique is based on the theory of plane motion of a rigid body, the theory of Hertzian contact deformation and the analytical dependencies for determination of coefficient of rolling friction. Findings. The obtained dependences on determination of rolling resistance of the balls or rollers along the bearing tracks of inner and outer bearing cages as well as path difference metering of the rolling on them allows to analytically obtain the rolling resistance and slipping for any size of bearings and different devices of bearing units. It is also possible at the design stage of rolling nodes to handle not only the design but also the content of the node. Originality. Using the analytical dependences for determination of the rolling resistance of bodies at point and line contacts, and also account for the difference in the path of the rolling ball or roller on the outer and inner cages of the bearing one can more accurately find the rolling resistance in the bearings. Practical value. The obtained dependences allow designing the bearing units with minimal energy consumption...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} a {{non-traditional}} cam and roller-follower mechanism is described here. In this mechanism, the roller-crank rather than the cam is used as the continuous input member, while both complete a full rotation in each revolution and remain in contact throughout. It is noted {{that in order to}} have the cam fully rotate for every full rotation of the roller-crank, the cam cannot be a closed profile, rather the roller tra-verses the open cam profile twice in each cycle. Using kinematic analysis, the angular velocity of the cam when the roller traverses the cam profile in one direction, is related to the angular velocity of the cam when the <b>roller</b> retraces its <b>path</b> on the cam in the other direction. Thus, one can specify any arbitrary function relating the motion of the cam to the motion of the roller-crank for only 180 ° of rotation in the angular velocity space. The motion of the cam in the remaining portion is then automatically determined. In specifying the arbitrary motion, many desirable characteristics such as multiple dwells, low acceleration and jerk, etc., can be obtained. Useful design equations are derived for this purpose. Using the kinematic in-version technique, the cam profile is readily obtained once the motion is specified in the angular velocity space. The only limitation to the arbitrary motion specification is making sure that the transmission angle never gets too low, so that the force will be transmitted eciently from roller to cam. This is addressed by incorporating a transmission index into the motion specification in the synthesis process. Consequently, in this method we can specify any arbitrary motion within a permissible zone, such that the transmission index is higher than the specified minimum value. Single-dwell, double-dwell and a long hesitation motion are used as examples to demonstrate the eectiveness of the design method. Force closure using an optimall...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn his {{typology}} Talmy distinguishes {{two types}} of languages {{as a function of}} how they encode motion events: Verb-framed languages, such as Romance languages, where PATH is typically lexicalized in verbs leaving MANNER implicit or in the periphery, and Satellite-framed languages, such as Germanic languages, where PATH is encoded in adjuncts accompanying systematically MANNER verbs. The aim of the present paper is to examine whether such cross-linguistic variation has any impact on the ways in which speakers conceptualize crucial aspects of motion events, in order to address current debates in the literature concerning the relationship between general and language-specific determinants of spatialcognition. More specifically, we investigate how speakers of two typologically different languages, English (N= 22) and French (N= 20), represent motion events in verbal and non-verbal tasks, as well as how they allocate attention to MANNER and PATH information while processing information about these events on-line. Three tasks were designed, all of which were coupled with an eye-tracking paradigm for further insights into on-line cognitive processing. Participants were randomly divided into two groups (hereafter ‘verbal’ and ‘non-verbal’ conditions). In the verbal condition, they first performed a production task (Figure 1) in which they described videos showing motion events that varied with respect to MANNER (WALK, RUN, JUMP, RIDE BICYCLE, RIDE SCOOTER, <b>ROLLER</b> SKATING) and <b>PATH</b> (UP, DOWN, ACROSS, ALONG, INTO, OUT OF). They then performed a categorization task (Figure 2) in which they saw a target video (e. g. a woman riding a bicycle into a building), then two variants that differed from the target with respect to PATH(choice 1 : ‘Manner-congruent’, e. g. BICYCLE-OUT) or with respect to MANNER (choice 2 : ‘Mannerincongruent’, e. g. SCOOTER-INTO). They had to choose which variant best matched the target. In the nonverbal condition, participants began the session with the categorization task, while simultaneously performing an interference task (syllable repetition) that prevented them from internally verbalizing the stimuli, which was followed by the production task. Analyses show the following main results. First, verbalizations during the production task show the strong impact of language-specific factors. French speakers focused mostly on PATH information (lexicalized in the verb), while English speakers expressed both MANNER (in the verb) and PATH (outside of the verb). Second, in both groups the eye tracking data during production show a strong preference for the most Manner-salient areas (i. e. that included the Figure’s legs) as opposed to least Manner-salient areas (i. e. that included the Figure’s head). In addition, English participants performed more and longer fixations in the most Manner-salient areas as compared to French speakers. However, when participants paid attention to the least Manner-salient areas, they did so more in the French sample than in the English sample. Third,subjects’ preferential choices during categorization show a language effect in the verbal version of the task, but not in the non-verbal version. In particular, in both conditions French participants relied more on PATH information when grouping events (Manner-incongruent criterion), while English participants do not show any particular preference (Manner-congruent or –incongruent). Finally, eye-tracking was consistent with subjects’ choices during the categorization task, showing that French participants focused their attention more on PATH information (Manner-incongruent variants) than English speakers, especially in the verbal condition. This effect was observed particularly with items in which MANNER was mostsalient because it involved an explicit instrument (e. g. bicycle). In conclusion, speakers are influenced by the properties of their language when describing and categorizing motion. However, this language effect is not observed to the same extent depending on the task, being most evident when the task explicitly involves language and least evident when the task is entirely non-verbal. In addition, variation in attention allocation suggests that visual behaviour is based on both general and language-specific constraints, thus supporting a ‘moderate’ view of linguistic relativity that allows for dynamic mutual interaction between language-specific and general cognitive factors...|$|R
