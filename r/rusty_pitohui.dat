50|$|The <b>rusty</b> <b>pitohui</b> was {{originally}} classified within the genus Rectes (a synonym for the genus Pitohui) until moved to Pseudorectes by the IOC in 2013. Alternatively, some other authorities classify the <b>rusty</b> <b>pitohui</b> in the genus Colluricincla. Alternate {{names for the}} <b>rusty</b> <b>pitohui</b> include the ferrugineous pitohui and rusty shrike-thrush.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>rusty</b> <b>pitohui</b> is {{distributed}} and endemic to lowland and hill forests of New Guinea, Aru Island and West Papuan islands.|$|E
50|$|Widespread {{and common}} {{throughout}} its habitat range, the <b>rusty</b> <b>pitohui</b> is evaluated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rusty</b> <b>pitohui</b> (Pseudorectes ferrugineus) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Pachycephalidae. It is found on the Aru Islands and New Guinea.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rusty</b> <b>pitohui</b> {{is usually}} seen in small parties, mixed with other gregarious species. It builds a deep, {{cup-shaped}} nest of sticks, leaves and stems in a fork of a tree.|$|E
50|$|The hooded butcherbird has {{a complex}} fluting song, {{made up of}} many varied components. Birds may duet with each other, or mimic other species such as the <b>rusty</b> <b>pitohui,</b> little shrikethrush, {{spangled}} drongo, or helmeted friarbird.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rusty</b> <b>pitohui</b> is a medium-sized, {{approximately}} 28 cm long, rusty brown songbird with {{a strong}} black bill, pale iris and yellowish-buff below. The subspecies P. f. leucorhynchus and P. f. fuscus of Waigeo and Batanta islands off Western New Guinea have a whitish bill. It is the largest member of its family. Both sexes are similar.|$|E
40|$|New Guinea. Two {{hundred and}} five bird species were {{recorded}} in lowland alluvial forest of the Basin: 170 breeding residents, 14 regular nonbreeding visitors, 10 local nonbreeding vagrants, and 11 migrants from Asia or Australia. The list includes 156 species of forest-dwelling birds, 82 of which are restricted to forest interior. No more than 171 species have been recorded from any single site. Surveys of {{less than two months}} â€™ duration produced significantly incomplete species lists; the recommended minimum effort for comprehensive site-based surveys in lowland rainforest of Papua New Guinea is four months total effort spread over several seasons. Results from individual surveys were skewed by a range of effects, some of which include observer bias, seasonal changes in avian detectability, and habitat-based effects. Having accounted for these sampling biases, we then present evidence for local patchiness of distribution within the Basin. Examples of locally patchy species include the Common Paradise Kingfisher Tanysiptera galatea and the <b>Rusty</b> <b>Pitohui</b> Pitohui ferrugineus, which are abundant at most sites but absent or rare at others. Floristic and structural heterogeneity at several scales in the Basin forests is undoubtedly a factor influencing within-Basin distribution of forest birds, and yet the complexity of the pattern of forest heterogeneity has hindered our delineating the full nature and extent to which birds track local fores...|$|E
