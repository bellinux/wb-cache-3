5|$|Since the <b>remainders</b> {{decrease}} {{with every}} step but can never be negative, a remainder r'N must eventually equal zero, {{at which point the}} algorithm stops. The final nonzero remainder r'N−1 is the greatest common divisor of a and b.

The <b>remainders</b> of the Ottoman fleet withdrew to Rhodes, from where they were however able to reach Candia.

Assume that a {{is larger than}} b {{at the beginning of}} an iteration; then a equals r'k−2, since r'k−2 > r'k−1.

Then b is reduced by multiples of a until it is again smaller than a, giving the next remainder r'k+1, and so on.|$|E
5|$|After {{deciding}} {{to begin work}} on a coin-operated version of Spacewar, the pair, with assistance from Tuck's family, bought a PDP-11 and started working on a prototype. They spent a total of 20,000 to build a single arcade machine for two players, like the original Spacewar, {{deciding to}} price the game at ten cents per play or 25 cents for three games, with the winner of a match given a free game. They used a PDP-11/20 version of the PDP-11 (US$14,000), a Hewlett-Packard 1300A Electrostatic Display (3,000), and spent the remainder on the coin acceptors, joysticks, wiring, and casing. Pitts build the computer hardware and handled the programming, while Tuck, a mechanical engineer, designed the enclosing cabinet. The display adapter for the monitor was built by Ted Panofski, the coin acceptors were sourced from jukebox manufacturer Rowe International, and the joysticks found at a military surplus store as <b>remainders</b> from B-52 bomber controls. The code for the game {{was based on a}} version of Spacewar running on a PDP-10 in the Stanford artificial intelligence lab, but modified with additional features.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} shows that Zhou dynasty divination was grounded in cleromancy, the production of seemingly random numbers to determine divine intent. The Zhou yi provided a guide to cleromancy that used the stalks of the yarrow plant, {{but it is not}} known how the yarrow stalks became numbers, or how specific lines were chosen from the line readings. In the hexagrams, broken lines were used as shorthand for the numbers 6 (六) and 8 (八), and solid lines were shorthand for values of 7 (七) and 9 (九). The Great Commentary contains a late classic description of a process where various numerological operations are performed on a bundle of 50 stalks, leaving <b>remainders</b> of 6 to 9. Like the Zhou yi itself, yarrow stalk divination dates to the Western Zhou period, although its modern form is a reconstruction.|$|E

40|$|We study bounded <b>remainder</b> sets {{with respect}} to an irrational {{rotation}} of the $d$-dimensional torus.
