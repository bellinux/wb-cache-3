40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that <b>administrative</b> <b>expenditures</b> in US higher education are growing too rapidly, particularly in relation to expenditures that {{are directly related to}} instruction, and that this so-called ‘administrative bloat’ is {{a major factor in the}} rising cost of higher education. We argue that this perception of rapid growth is exaggerated, and that it results from focusing on simple expenditure aggregates that obscure important variation across institutions. A more careful analysis using panel-data methods supports a more benign conclusion that <b>administrative</b> <b>expenditures,</b> and their ratio to instructional expenditures, are stationary over time. This conclusion is supported by panel unit-root tests. This suggests that some of the concern about the role of <b>administrative</b> <b>expenditures</b> in rising higher-education costs may be misdirected...|$|R

30|$|For {{administrative}} spending, model 3 shows that, as expected, coal dependence has {{a significant}} {{positive effect on the}} share of <b>administrative</b> <b>expenditures</b> in total expenditures. Among the 96 county-level governments, <b>administrative</b> <b>expenditures</b> averagely account for 21  % of total expenditures, a smaller percentage than that of social expenditures, which is 51  % (see Table  4). However, the coefficient of the Coal Dependence Index on the former is 0.078, while on the latter, it is − 0.032. This shows that <b>administrative</b> <b>expenditures</b> are more sensitive to the coal economy. For control variables, the coefficient of total population is positive and statistically significant, which suggests that there is a scale economy in administrative spending. The negative coefficients of land area and county-level city dummy, although not statistically significant at the 10  % level, also suggest the effect of scale economy.|$|R

40|$|The {{concerns}} for reducing <b>administrative</b> <b>expenditures</b> have been {{expressed in the}} last 10 - 15 years in concrete initiatives. It is worth to remark the occurrence of networks concerning the application of Standard Cost Model (SCM), aimed to reduce <b>administrative</b> <b>expenditures</b> for affairs. Even the European Commission aims to elaborate and implement a strategy to reduce administrative costs for affairs inside the European Union. We find similar initiatives in OECD, several European states, i. e. United Kingdom, Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, {{as well as other}} countries. An international project "Cross Country Benchmarking" is important in this respect. These concerns have developed and diversified due to the worsening of the economic crisis. The crisis effects, already visible in the public sector too, lessen more and more the possibilities of satisfying the citizen's needs. The marketing specialists bring up more and more frequently new marketing instruments that, giving the context, should generate products and services meant to satisfy the citizens' needs. The product and service, in itself, as well as their price, become the main marketing instruments. The present paper proposes an assessment, based on the two instruments of the public marketing mix, {{of the way in which}} the reduction of the <b>administrative</b> <b>expenditures</b> can lead to a reduction in the price of the public services or to their diversification with regard to the consumers' needs.

In the context of ongoing discussions on administrative reform, this study compares <b>administrative</b> <b>expenditures</b> in Austria with expenditures in other EU and OECD countries. Independently of the definition of <b>administrative</b> <b>expenditures</b> selected, Austria generally falls into the international mid-range, with high savings potential found in Austria's general administration. Depending on the country of reference examined, and under the assumption of equal quality and range of administrative services among countries, we find a theoretical efficiency reserve of ¾ to € 2 ½ billion – even when taking into account diseconomies of scale of Austria as a small country. Based on an international performance and efficiency comparison, we still find significant efficiency reserves in Austria's general public administration. WIFO estimates point toward another € ½ billion of additional savings potential that could be attained by reducing the complexity of legislation and administrative processes.

40|$|The {{expenditures}} {{of public}} {{higher education institutions}} have increased steadily over the last decade, a trend echoing the well-documented general tendency for increases in public-sector expenditures. Within public higher education, however, trends have proven more variable. Among the functional areas of instruction, academic support, student services, institutional support, and operations and maintenance, the growth in expenditures {{has been found to}} vary in both nationwide examination of higher education expenditures and in case studies of individual institutions. Variation in expenditure growth also has been observed for these functional areas when examined by type of institution. One consistency has surfaced [...] <b>administrative</b> <b>expenditures</b> have increased at a significantly higher rate than expenditures in other areas. A variety of influences may promote that trend. Theoretically, general expenditure growth in higher education has resulted from (1) the tendency toward revenue and prestige maximization, (2) lack of an efficiency motive, and (3) labor-cost intensiveness. Expenditure increases in specific functional areas also would be expected to reflect consistent, incremental growth. However, growth in <b>administrative</b> <b>expenditures,</b> recently coined "administrative bloat", is out-pacing growth in other functions. At first glance, revenue and prestige maximization would seem to provide little or no explanation for this trend, if not suggesting the opposite; institutions struggling to develop activities that clearly influence prestige (instruction, research, and service) would presumably tend to increase allocations for those activities and decrease allocations for discretionary administrative activities. Obviously, other perspectives are called for; these more focused perspectives may individually or collaboratively suggest explanations. The purposes of this study were to identify <b>administrative</b> <b>expenditure</b> trends and to determine the reasons for these trends through a case study. These issues were of interest to many parties, including legislative representatives, higher education system coordinators, institutional administrators, faculty, staff, and students...|$|R
