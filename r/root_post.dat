KG Lemgo, Germany) with a decreasing diameter shape (turret like) and how these can be improved by the choice of fixing cement. METHODS: The tensile strength was assessed {{in relation to the}} type of cement used. The following cements were tested: Compolute composite cement (Espe), C/B Crown & Bridge Luting Composite (Bisco), Diamond Link cement (DRM) with Harvard cement as a control. The cementing procedures laid down by the manufacturers were followed in the case of each cement. The results of the traction tests were analysed and compared statistically and a SEM evaluation of the root/cement and cement/post interface was carried out. RESULTS: The results showed that the highest absolute mean value (best performance) was Diamond Link cement (46. 48 +/- 14. 31 kg) which also came out best in the statistical analysis (Scheffe Test p= 0. 007). Analysis of the samples at the SEM confirmed the results of the traction tests. CONCLUSIONS: The characteristic > form of the Optipost <b>root</b> <b>post</b> and the sanding of the surface would appear to be important factors which, together with the adhesive cementing technique, lead to a high decementing resistance...|$|E
40|$|After (extensive) loss of tooth tissue, vital teeth can be {{built up}} {{completely}} with composite restoration material. Sometimes, the application of additional retentive preparations is indicated. In exceptional cases, a root canal treatment is indicated, following which a root canal post is applied if necessary. Endodontically treated multi-rooted teeth {{can be built}} up entirely with composite, utilizing the pulp chamber and root canal accesses for retention. However, in single-rooted teeth a root canal post is necessary, in which case a prefabricated <b>root</b> <b>post</b> is used. Traditionally, metal posts were used in combination with a cast, indirect build-up restoration. Subsequently, directly fabricated cores, combining metal posts with amalgam or, at the present time, composite restoration material, became customary.

After restoring a tooth with a build-up restoration, a combined build-up restoration can be chosen, or a direct or indirect crown single tooth prosthesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{restoration}} of endodontically treated teeth {{is a common}} task for the clinician. After completing endodontic treatment the tooth must be restored to fulfill clinical function. The necessity of {{restoration of}} an endodontically treated tooth must be taken under consideration even before starting endodontic procedure. Endodontically treated teeth have usually lost {{a major part of}} dental tissues due to caries and endodontic procedures. The use of a <b>root</b> <b>post</b> and core does not contribute to increased mechanical stability, as it was believed in the past. On the contrary the use of root posts may further weaken the existing tooth structure because of further dentine removable. The main clinical objective in the use of posts and cores is to ensure proper retention for a core material in order to allow prosthetic restoration of the remaining tooth. Endodontic posts are classified according to their fabrication procedure to refabricated and individually constructed. From a material point of view they can be divided to metallic, ceramic, carbon-fiber and glass-fiber posts. Another classification of the prefabricated root posts is based on the shape of the posts as conical, cylindrical etc. According to the mode of retention in the root dental walls posts can be classified as cement-retained or screw-retained. The aim {{of this article is to}} emphasize the factors that must be considered in the restoration of endodontically treated teeth and present the clinical stages in three clinical cases.

40|$|A restauracao dos dentes tratados endodonticamente muitas vezes e uma tarefa complexa em razao da grande perda de estrutura coronaria. Quando a destruicao atinge a raiz, os canais muito amplos dificultam a colocacao de pinos intra-radiculares necessaria para a reabilitacao protetica do dente. A reconstrucao {{cervical}} por meio de materiais adesivos tem sido sugerida, devido as propriedades mecanicas favoraveis e a adesao as paredes dentinarias. Este trabalho teve por objetivo aplicar o metodo dos elementos finitos para: a) comparar a distribuicao de tensoes em dentes tratados endodonticamente com raizes reconstruidas com resina composta ou ionomero de vidro cermet entre si, e em relacao a dentes tratados endodonticamente com raizes estruturalmente integras, sob carga estatica; b) verificar os provaveis tipos de falha da reconstrucao (fratura radicular, deslocamento do pino) de acordo com a resistencia da dentina e dos materiais utilizados, e sua provavel localizacao; c) de posse da magnitude e da distribuicao das tensoes, verificar o comportamento desses dentes sob carregamento ciclico, com base na resistencia a fadiga dos materiais estudados; e d) comparar os resultados obtidos com os disponiveis na literatura. O programa Ansys¥ 12. 0 (Canonsburg, PA, EUA) foi utilizado para modelagem e processamento. Foram confeccionados 3 modelos geometricos tridimensionais, representando um incisivo central superior com raiz integra, restaurado com pino/nucleo/coroa total (Modelo 1), ou com o canal ampliado e paredes radiculares reconstruidas com resina composta (Modelo 2) e ionomero de vidro cermet (Modelo 3). Uma carga de 100 N foi aplicada na regiao palatina, a 130 o com o longo eixo do dente. As tensoes principais (S 1 e S 3) foram analisadas no dente, na raiz isolada, no pino, no cimento e na area da reconstrucao radicular. Sob carga estatica, os resultados indicaram que a falha na dentina radicular e pouco provavel. Entretanto, existe a possibilidade de falha nas interfaces adesivas. No Modelo 2, a falha mais provavel ocorreria na uniao cimento/dentina, enquanto que no Modelo 3, a falha ocorreria na uniao ionomero/dentina. O comportamento do Modelo 2 ficou mais proximo do Modelo 1 do que Modelo 3. Nos tres modelos, os dentes trabalham proximos a resistencia a fadiga da dentina. Os resultados apontaram um prognostico desfavoravel para as reconstrucoes adesivas de raizes fragilizadas, devendo ser indicadas com cautela, levando-se em consideracao as caracteristicas individuais dos pacientes. The {{restoration of}} endodontically treated teeth {{is often a}} complex task, because of the great loss of coronal structure. When the destruction reaches the root, the flared canal makes the insertion of an endodontic post very difficult, during the prosthetic rehabilitation of the tooth. The reconstruction of the cervical root walls with adhesive restorative materials has been suggested, due to their favorable mechanical properties and dentin bonding ability. This study aimed to apply the finite element method to: (a) compare the stress distribution in endodontically treated teeth with reconstructed roots to those with healthy roots, under static loads; (b) investigate the location and probable modes of failure (root fracture, post dislodgement) of the reconstructed roots, according {{to the strength of}} the dentin and the materials used; (c) verify the behavior of these teeth under cyclic loads, based on the stress magnitudes and distributions, and also, based on the fatigue strength of the simulated materials; (d) compare the results to the data available in the literature. The software Ansys¥ 12. 0 (Canonsburg, PA, EUA) was used for modeling and processing. Three geometric 3 D models were created, representing a maxillary central incisor with a healthy root, post/core and crown restored (Model 1), or with weakened roots reconstructed with composite resin (Modelo 2) or cermet glass ionomer cement (Model 3) prior to the post/core/crown restoration. A 100 N load was applied on the palatal surface at 130 o to the long axis of the tooth. The principal stresses (S 1 and S 3) were used for the stress analysis of the tooth, isolated <b>root,</b> <b>post,</b> cement and root reconstruction area. Under static loads, the results indicated that failure is unlikely to occur in the root dentin. However, there is a possibility of failure of the adhesive interfaces. In Model 2, the most probable failure would appear along the cement/dentin bonding interface, while in Model 3, this would happen along the dentin/ionomer interface. When compared to Model 3, the behavior of Model 2 is more similar to that of Model 1. Based on the fatigue strength of the materials that were simulated, the results demonstrate that, for the 3 models, the teeth work very close to the fatigue limit of the dentin. The results indicate an unfavorable prognosis for the adhesively reconstructed thin-walled roots. Therefore this treatment modality should be carefully indicated, taking into account the individual features of the patient...|$|E

40|$|Context: Two of the {{problems}} of the placement of posts in teeth with short roots are to determine the minimum length of the canal obturation material at the apical third of the root canal and removal of all the canal obturation material from the <b>root</b> canal during <b>post</b> space preparation. Aim: The aim {{of the present study was}} to compare the coronal microleakage of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) plug and gutta-percha in short <b>roots</b> prepared for <b>post</b> placement using the bacterial penetration technique. Materials and Methods: In the presentin vitro study, 40 extracted single-rooted anterior teeth measuring 13 mm in root length were selected. Since the roots were short, 3 mm of the root length was allocated to the root canal obturation material and 10 mm of the root length was allocated to post placement. After preparation of the <b>root</b> canals, <b>post</b> spaces were prepared and the samples were randomly divided into two groups of gutta-percha and MTA. Fifteen root canals were obturated with gutta-percha and the post space was immediately prepared, with 3 mm of gutta-percha remaining in the apical end of the root canal. In 15 teeth, MTA plugs were placed, which measured 3 mm in length. The samples were placed in the Enterococcus faecalis bacterial microleakage system for 120 days. The time for the turbidity of each sample was recorded. Data were analyzed with Fisher's exact test. Results: During the study period, turbidity was observed in all the gutta-percha samples and in only four MTA samples, with statistically significant differences between the two groups (P< 0. 001).

Upper molars, pre-molars with two <b>posts</b> and <b>roots</b> of lower molars with two posts were excluded. Technical parameters of the post space preparation, endodontic and restorative status were evaluated.

Results: The distance from the bone level to the CEJ/restoration margin was similar for teeth with posts and contra-laterals. However, teeth with posts had more angular defects mesially (18. 8 %versus 7. 3 %) as compared with their contra-laterals without posts. The defects around teeth with posts appeared to be typical in the sense that their apical level approximated the tip of the endodontic post.

40|$|The {{advantage}} of tapered passive <b>root</b> <b>posts</b> is their homogenous force transmission without creating stress peaks on the root surface {{because of their}} anatomical root form. However, their expected retentive strengths are low compared with the other post systems. The objective of this in vitro {{study was to determine}} the retentive strengths of five tapered post systems from different manufacturers using tensile tests. For this purpose, all posts were cemented with zinc phosphate cement (Tenet(R)) into the roots of 50 intact anterior teeth according to the manufacturer's instructions for each system. The contact surface area between the root canal wall and the post was taken into account in the calculations in order to obtain comparable results for different post configurations. The highest bond strength values were achieved for the Erlangen post system(R) (10. 8 N mm(- 2),) and MP Pirec post system(R) (10 N mm(- 2)). These values were more than three times those of the Velva-Post(R) (3. 2 N mm(- 2)) and the Cylindro-Conical system(R) (3. 5 N mm(- 2)) and five times more than those of the Dr Mooser post system(R) (1. 7 N mm(- 2)). The bond strength values of the Erlangen post system(R), Cylindro-Conical system(R) and Dr Mooser post system(R) showed statistically significant differences compared with the other groups. The results of this study indicated that the bond strengths of tapered posts were not only affected by the contact surface but also by the taper angle, shape of the post system, the width of the cement joint, surface roughness of the posts as well as the form of the canal wall. in clinical practice, in case of choosing tapered posts with similar shapes, retention may still vary because of other factors...|$|R

In 1974, Lowell Heritage State Park was founded, and in 1978, Lowell National Historical Park was created as an urban national park, through legislation filed by Lowell native, congressman, and later senator Paul Tsongas. The canal system, many mills, and some commercial structures downtown were saved by the creation of the park and the visitors it brought.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAimThe {{targets of}} the endodontic therapy are damaged tissue and {{bacteria}} removal from the canals and dentinal tubules and the prevention of recontamination after the treatment. IntroductionCorrect endodontic treatment has to follow several parameters: proper diagnosis, isolation of operating field, full chemo-mechanical preparation of the complex endodontic system, three-dimensional obturation of the <b>root</b> canals, <b>post</b> endodontic restoration. Respecting all these parameters {{short and long term}} success can be achieved. Materials and methodsIn this article an orthograde retreatment of maxillary first molar has been described, which showed at pre-operative X-ray, an incongruous endodontic therapy, the failed finding of the fourth canal and the presence of periapical lesions. DiscussionA high percentage of failures is due to missed root canals and therefore not cleansed, shaped and it is essential to use modern technologies to achieve safe and reproducible results. ConclusionsThe endodontic retreatment of this right maxillary first molar was performed with the proper protocols and sophisticated tools, with which we can achieve success in the short- and long-term treatments...|$|R

5000|$|Freedom Township {{was settled}} in 1818 and {{organized}} in 1825, {{one of the}} last townships in Portage County to be organized. The first settler was Charles Paine, son of General Edward Paine, whom Painesville, Ohio, is named after. It was said to have been named by Charles Paine's wife after the idea of freedom. Previously it had been referred to as [...] "North Rootstown" [...] since the original proprietor was Ephraim <b>Root.</b> A <b>post</b> office called Freedom was established in 1826 at the town center, and remained in operation until 1903, while another post office for Freedom Station was established in 1864 and remained in operation until 1957. Freedom Station was a station and shipping point on the New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio Railroad. The unincorporated community of Drakesburg is located {{in the eastern part of}} the township along Ohio State Route 303. It is named for settler Orasumus Drake, who arrived in 1829.|$|R
