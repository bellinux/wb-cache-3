25|$|Thread forming {{and thread}} rolling are {{processes}} for forming screw threads, {{with the former}} referring to creating internal threads and the latter external threads. In both of these processes threads are formed into a blank by pressing a shaped tool, commonly called a 'thread rolling die' against the blank, in a process similar to knurling. These processes are used for large production runs because typical production rates are around one piece per second. Forming and rolling produce no swarf and less material is required because the blank size starts smaller than a blank required for cutting threads; there is typically a 15 to 20% material savings in the blank, by weight. A <b>rolled</b> <b>thread</b> can be easily recognized on fasteners that were formed from an unstopped blank because the thread has a larger diameter than the blank rod from which it has been made; however, necks and undercuts can be cut or rolled onto blanks with threads that are not rolled, and some fasteners are made from blanks with a reduced shank {{in the region to}} be rolled to maintain a constant major diameter from thread to unthreaded shank.

40|$|This {{document}} {{describes a}} fatigue lifetime acceptance test criterion by which studs having rolled threads, larger than 1. 0 inches in diameter, {{can be assured}} to meet minimum quality attributes associated with a controlled rolling process. This criterion is derived from a stress dependent, room temperature air fatigue database for test studs having a 0. 625 inch diameter threads of Alloys X- 750 HTH and direct aged 625. Anticipated fatigue lives of larger threads are based on thread root elastic stress concentration factors which increase with increasing thread diameters. Over the thread size range of interest, a 30 % increase in notch stress is equivalent to a factor of five (5 X) reduction in fatigue life. The resulting diameter dependent fatigue acceptance criterion is normalized to the aerospace <b>rolled</b> <b>thread</b> acceptance standards for a 1. 0 inch diameter, 0. 125 inch pitch, Unified National thread with a controlled Root radius (UNR). Testing was conducted at a stress of 50 % of the minimum specified material ultimate strength, 80 Ksi, and at a stress ratio (R) of 0. 10. Limited test data for fastener diameters of 1. 00 to 2. 25 inches are compared to the acceptance criterion. Sensitivity of fatigue life of threads to test nut geometry variables was also shown {{to be dependent on}} notch stress conditions. Bearing surface concavity of the compression nuts and thread flank contact mismatch conditions can significantly affect the fastener fatigue life. Without improved controls these conditions could potentially provide misleading acceptance data.

Externally threaded fasteners comprise the bulk of fasteners used in these applications with over 90 % of being produced by thread rolling. The thread rolling process is now widely acknowledged as the fastest and most efficient method of producing accurate external threads, with surface finish and mechanical properties. The typical production rates are around one piece per second. In order to ensure a perfect thread rolling process, it is important for blank of work piece to be properly pre-machined.

40|$|Accelerated {{testing in}} environments {{aggressive}} {{for the specific}} material have shown that fastener <b>threads</b> that are <b>rolled</b> after strengthening heat treatments have improved resistance to SCC initiation. For example, intergranular SCC was produced in one day when machined (cut) threads of high strength steel (ASTM A 193 B- 7 and A 354 Grade 8) were exposed to an aggressive aqueous environment containing 8 weight % boiling ammonium nitrate and stressed to about 40 % of the steel's yield strength (120 ksi, 827 MPa). In similar testing conditions, fasteners that had <b>threads</b> <b>rolled</b> before heat-treatment (quench and temper) had similar susceptibility to SCC. However, <b>threads</b> <b>rolled</b> after strengthening, exhibited no SCC {{after a week of}} exposure, even when stressed to 100 % of the B- 7 alloy yield strength. Similarly, intergranular SCC was produced in less than one day when machined (cut) threads of nickel-base alloys (X- 750 and aged 625) were exposed to an aggressive 750 F doped steam environment (containing 100 ppm of chloride, fluoride, sulfate, nitrate and a controlled hydrogen overpressure) and stressed to about 80 % of the alloy yield strength (117 ksi, 807 MPa). In similar testing conditions, <b>threads</b> <b>rolled</b> after strengthening exhibited no SCC after 50 days of exposure. This beneficial effect of the optimum thread rolling process (i. e., <b>threads</b> <b>rolled</b> after strengthening) is due to the retention of large residual compressive stresses in the thread roots (notches) which mitigate the applied notch tensile stresses resulting from joint design pre-loads. use of these material specific aggressive environments can provide an accelerated test to verify that threads were produced by the optimum thread rolling process. These tests could support fastener acceptance criteria or failure analysis of fasteners with unknown or uncertain manufacturing processes. The optimum process effects may not always be detected by more conventional methods (e. g., metallography or hardness testing) ...|$|R

40|$|Planetary roller drives (PRD) with axial {{backlash}} {{have the highest}} load capacity amongst the prospective roller drives. PRD consists of a screw and a nut, between which <b>thread</b> <b>rolls</b> are installed in separators, force calculation of which is sufficient to assess the PRD force loading. For several reasons, the load is unevenly distributed between the roll turns operating with the screw and nut turns. These include rollers size variation by the average diameter of their thread, PRD parts' thread manufacturing errors, primarily thread pitch errors, and other reasons. The article discusses one of them – a special feature of <b>thread</b> <b>roll</b> loading. If we neglect the circumferential forces due to their smallness, then the roll's turns mating with the nut along one of the roll's generatrices and the roll turns mating with the screw along the opposite generatrix will be loaded with axial and radial forces. Since the PRD parts thread turn flank angle is symmetrical and equal to 90 °, then the radial force {{is equal to the}} axial one on each turn. If we sum the axial forces on the mating roll turns along one of the generatrices, then from the equation of equilibrium one gets that the sum vector value is equal to the sum vector value along the other roll generatrix. Here the sum vectors will have the opposite direction, and the arm between them equals to the average <b>roll</b> <b>thread</b> diameter. Multiplying the sum vector modulus by that arm, one gets the roll overturning moment that does not depend on the distribution of the axial forces along the roll axis. This moment is the cause of uneven load distribution between the roll turns mating with the nut and the screw. The overturning moment can be balanced on the two forming roll generatrices only by radial forces, distribution of which along the roll axis will be uneven. The PRD parts thread turns load distribution irregularity factor is introduced as the ratio of the maximum force acting on the most loaded roll turn to a nominal force. It is determined in the example that the value of this factor is equal to 1. 454 or 45. 4 %, i. e. the influence of the PRD roll loading characteristics on the drive threaded parts turns loading irregularity is strong...|$|R

All bolts were made from 840 Grade steel, a medium carbon manganese silicon vanadium hot rolled microalloyed steel, and had a diameter of 22 mm. All six bolts had been installed in a single mine which had a high-pH, sulphate-rich groundwater. Prior to investigating the failed bolts, some preliminary studies were undertaken to provide background information for the work. The first of these involved tensile testing of notched and un-notched rock bolts made from the same steel as the failed rock bolts. The notched rock bolt contained a 2 mm deep flat-bottomed V notch with a bottom width of 0. 5 mm, while the full rock bolt profile was retained for the un-notched test. The un-notched rock bolt underwent substantial necking and failed by microvoid coalescence. The notched rock bolt showed no appreciable macroscopic plasticity and failed by cleavage. Additionally, a sample from the same rock bolt steel was loaded through the threads in bending until failure occurred. Fracture initiated at the base of one of the threads and propagated in a ductile manner by microvoid coalescence for the first 1. 5 mm of the fracture, but thereafter by brittle cleavage. Stable cracks were also produced at the base of the adjoining threads. The effect of corrosion by mine water on the appearance of ductile (microvoid coalescence) and brittle (cleavage) fracture surfaces in the same steel was also examined. Corrosion substantially changed the appearance of both types of fracture surface, but the two different types of fracture were still quite different in appearance. Five of the six rock bolts were found to have failed by stress corrosion, with cracking initiating at the base of one of the threads.
