25|$|In {{semiconductor}} {{research and}} industry, PMMA aids as a resist in the {{electron beam lithography}} process. A solution consisting of the polymer in a solvent is used to spin coat silicon and other semiconducting and semi-insulating wafers with a thin film. Patterns on this {{can be made by}} an electron beam (using an electron microscope), deep UV light (shorter wavelength than the standard photolithography process), or X-rays. Exposure to these creates chain scission or (de-cross-linking) within the PMMA, allowing for the selective removal of exposed areas by a chemical developer, making it a positive photoresist. PMMA's advantage is that it allows for extremely high resolution patterns to be made.

Here, we investigate the simultaneous presence of both effects, i. e. a dual-frequency plasma driven by two consecutive harmonics with different electrode materials. We find, that the superposition of the EAE and the SEAE is non-linear, i. e. the asymmetries generated by each individual effect do not simply add up.

40|$|A Computationally Assisted Spectroscopic Technique {{to measure}} {{secondary}} electron emission coefficients (γ-CAST) in capacitively-coupled <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>plasmas</b> is proposed. This non-intrusive, sensitive diagnostic {{is based on a}} combination of Phase Resolved Optical Emission Spectroscopy and particle-based kinetic simulations. In such plasmas (under most conditions in electropositive gases) the spatio-temporally resolved electron-impact excitation/ionization rate features two distinct maxima adjacent to each electrode at different times within each RF period. While one maximum is the consequence of the energy gain of electrons due to sheath expansion, the second maximum is produced by secondary electrons accelerated towards the plasma bulk by the sheath electric field at the time of maximum voltage drop across the adjacent sheath. Due to these different excitation/ionization mechanisms, the ratio of the intensities of these maxima is very sensitive to the {{secondary electron emission}} coefficient γ. This sensitvity, in turn, allows γ to be determined by comparing experimental excitation profiles and simulation data obtained with various γ-coefficients. The diagnostic, tested here in a geometrically symmetric argon discharge, yields an effective secondary electron emission coefficient of γ = 0. 066 ± 0. 01 for stainless steel electrodes...|$|R
