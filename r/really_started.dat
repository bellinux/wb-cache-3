25|$|Hayward's career <b>really</b> <b>started</b> to gain {{momentum}} when he {{was cast}} in the prologue of Warner Bros' expensive blockbuster Anthony Adverse (1936), playing {{the father of the}} title character. His profile was also raised by marriage to Ida Lupino.|$|E
25|$|The {{line was}} {{actually}} one of the first proposed in Ireland, as the Dublin and Baltinglass Tramway, but the costs of setting up operation under the early legislation were deemed prohibitive, and it was only after its promoters obtained the Dublin Tramways Act, 1881 (c. 17 of that year) that work <b>really</b> <b>started.</b>|$|E

This controversial game also helped feed a conspiracy that the NRL was trying to prevent Queensland teams from making the grand final.|$|E

25|$|The club <b>really</b> <b>started</b> to grow & {{with the}} {{promotion}} to the Premiership competition. Ellerslie gained {{the services of}} two outstanding English professionals, Wilf Slack, a stylish left hand opening batsmen and medium pace bowler who was West Indian and Ian Gould an excellent wicketkeeper and right hand batsman. Both Wilf & Ian hailed from the Middlesex County Cricket Club 2nd XI but in future years would both move on and play for England.|$|E
25|$|When the Corfu {{started to}} be {{imported}} {{into the rest of}} Europe in 1785, the communities adherent through Ashkenazi tradition to the Genoese variety were very skeptical about it. The Ashkenazim assumed that since the Greek is so much different from the Genoese, it might have been grafted or hybridized. At the beginning of the 19th century, when the Yanova Esrog was ceased due to the battles of Napoleon I of France, it <b>really</b> <b>started</b> to dominate the market.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{some other}} areas of Edinburgh, Corstorphine escaped {{widespread}} industrialisation in the nineteenth century. It only <b>really</b> <b>started</b> to become absorbed into the Edinburgh urban area within the mid-twentieth century. But even before then, there was a changeover into a middle-class dormitory area for Edinburgh workers. By the late twentieth century, Corstorphine had an ageing demographic. In 1961, Queen Margaret College (now QMU) obtained land up {{on the edge of}} Corstorphine next to Clermiston, and set up a campus there. This was closed in 2007, when they moved all their facilities out to Musselburgh.|$|E

25|$|The club competed {{regularly}} in regattas in Ireland and Scotland. Rowing was maintained {{at a low}} level throughout the war years; however, after the war the club <b>really</b> <b>started</b> making an impact, and under the vigorous captaincy of F.J. Boyle (1944/45), it won the Wylie Cup (Irish University Championships) for the first time. Success continued under H.F. Jackson in 1945/46 when the club retained the Wylie Cup, and next year went to Henley Royal Regatta for the first time. In 1947 a Queen's four won the Metropolitan Challenge Cup (the 'Blue Riband' of Irish Four rowing) and many other trophies.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, Calderone, Badalamenti and Di Cristina {{decided to}} go on and Francesco Madonia was murdered on April 8, 1978, by Di Cristina and Salvatore Pillera (from Catania, who was {{dispatched}} by Calderone). In retaliaton, Di Cristina was killed in May 1978 by the Corleonesi. Next was Giuseppe Calderone, who was killed on September 8, 1978. His rival Nitto Santapaola – who had forged an alliance with the Corleonesi – took over the command of the Catania Mafia Family. These skirmishes were just a prelude to the Second Mafia War that <b>really</b> <b>started</b> after the murder of Stefano Bontade in 1981.|$|E
25|$|By {{the second}} half of the 19th century, Berlin had been growing at a {{tremendous}} rate for some time, but its growth accelerated even faster after the city became the capital of the new German Empire on 18 January 1871. Potsdamer Platz and neighbouring Leipziger Platz <b>really</b> <b>started</b> coming into their own from this time on. Now firmly in the centre of a metropolis whose population eventually reached 4.4 million, making it the third largest city in the world after London and New York, the area was ready to take on its most celebrated role. Vast hotels and department stores, hundreds of smaller shops, theatres, dance-halls, cafés, restaurants, bars, beer palaces, wine-houses and clubs, all started to appear. Some of these places became internationally known.|$|E

25|$|Shuttleworth {{made his}} {{first-class}} cricket debut in 1964 {{when he was}} aged nineteen, tall, raw, but genuinely a fast bowler. He took fifty wickets in 1967, but <b>really</b> <b>started</b> to burst through in 1968, when Brian Statham was fading from the scene. His best season was in 1970, when he took seventy-four wickets at 21.60 runs each, and played for England against The Rest of the World, at Lord's. He went to Australia with Ray Illingworth's Ashes-winning team and started his Test career with five for 47 at Brisbane. He played five times in all for England - four of them that winter in Australia and New Zealand, the other against Pakistan in 1971 - and took twelve wickets at 35.58 each.|$|E
25|$|With {{his career}} {{stalling}} McCulloch {{was forced to}} drop down to Division Four in his next move when he joined Brentford in March 1976 for a club record £25000 fee. His move to The Bees rejuvenated his career {{although it was not}} until his second full season (1977–78) that things <b>really</b> <b>started</b> to happen when Brentford achieved promotion with McCulloch scoring 22 goals in 45 League appearances and forming a fine striking partnership with Steve Phillips who contributed an excellent 32 goals. In the Summer of 1978 McCulloch was loaned out to Oakland Stompers of the North American Soccer League where he made 18 appearances, scoring three goals with one assist. Back at Brentford for the 1978–79 campaign, the team consolidated their position in Division Three with McCulloch contributing 13 goals.|$|E
25|$|On 22 May 1942 he {{achieved}} his 9th victory. Over the frontline Bf 109s of his staffel bounced 20 P-40s escorting 12 Martin Baltimore bombers. Stahlschmidt shot down a P-40 from No. 250 Squadron RAF. Stahlschmidt gained his 10th victory on 29 May 1942 as the Battle of Gazala and Battle of Bir Hakeim raged. His staffel attacked P-40s of No. 450 Squadron RAF and claimed three shot down. Stahlschmidt claimed a single victory—Sergeants Dean, Packer and Shaw were posted missing in action. Four {{days after his}} 9th victory on 22 May 1942, Erwin Rommel launched his counter-offensive that would eventually take the Axis forces back across Libya and Egypt. It was now that Stahlschmidt's combat success <b>really</b> <b>started.</b> On 26 June the Geschwader crossed over onto Egyptian soil, at Sidi Barrani.|$|E

25|$|Analysts and pollsters offered {{different}} opinions on whether smaller extraparliamentary parties had chances to enter parliament or not. According to some pollsters, the FRITZ had very good {{chances of getting}} into parliament, and the LIF with its founder Schmidt as its leading candidate, as well; the conditions were {{as good as they}} had never been before for smaller parties, according to some. Analysts agreed that apart from LIF and FRITZ, all others would fail to enter parliament. Analysts furthermore asserted that the candidacy of the FRITZ would likely make the race for third place between Greens and FPÖ very competitive, as the FRITZ would likely gain protest votes which would otherwise go to the FPÖ. The critical time for the extraparliamentary parties was stated to be the very first phase of the campaign, when the larger parties had not yet <b>really</b> <b>started</b> campaigning and the smaller parties had a chance to gain publicity.|$|E

Then they're like, 'We want to hear a hip-hop record.' 'Why is she dressing like this? She should show less skin.' 'She should show more.' You know what I mean?

500|$|Prost's Jean Alesi {{was passed}} {{fit in the}} days leading up to the race. At the {{previous}} race, Alesi had suffered a serious crash which involved a collision with Sauber driver Pedro Diniz, although he escaped uninjured apart from abdominal pains and suffered from dizziness and vomiting. Prost had their test driver Stéphane Sarrazin ready to replace Alesi should the latter had suffered a relapse. Alesi said he felt ready to race again: [...] "It took a few days before I <b>really</b> <b>started</b> to recover, but now I sleep and feel much better".|$|E
500|$|Marta Hoelsher of Technorati Media said: [...] "The biggest news {{of season}} two, though, is the {{appearance}} of Donna Mills as Abby Cunningham, the blonde bombshell who wreaks havoc all through the neighborhood. With {{the appearance of}} Abby, things <b>really</b> <b>started</b> to heat up and get interesting. No marriage is off limits when Abby sets her eyes on it. Played to perfection by Donna Mills, Abby is wicked, vicious, bitchy, and heartless enough to keep us loving and hating her for years. Abby's clashes with Karen MacKenzie and Val were legendary, and season two gets things rolling. After a fairly peaceful start to the season, we start to see {{the beginnings of the}} rivalry that defines the show for years: [...] Karen vs. Abby. [...] It's fun watching their early friendship evolve into a bitter rivalry." ...|$|E
