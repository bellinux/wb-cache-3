5|$|Enzymes called DNA ligases can rejoin cut {{or broken}} DNA strands. Ligases are {{particularly}} important in lagging strand DNA replication, as they join together the short segments of DNA produced at the <b>replication</b> <b>fork</b> into a complete copy of the DNA template. They are also used in DNA repair and genetic recombination.|$|E
5|$|Topoisomerases {{introduce}} both single- and double-strand {{breaks in}} the course of changing the DNA's state of supercoiling, which is especially common in regions near an open <b>replication</b> <b>fork.</b> Such breaks are not considered DNA damage because they are a natural intermediate in the topoisomerase biochemical mechanism and are immediately repaired by the enzymes that created them.|$|E
5|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{requires the}} presence of an identical or nearly identical sequence {{to be used as a}} template for repair of the break. The enzymatic machinery responsible for this repair process is nearly identical to the machinery responsible for chromosomal crossover during meiosis. This pathway allows a damaged chromosome to be repaired using a sister chromatid (available in G2 after DNA replication) or a homologous chromosome as a template. DSBs caused by the replication machinery attempting to synthesize across a single-strand break or unrepaired lesion cause collapse of the <b>replication</b> <b>fork</b> and are typically repaired by recombination.|$|E
40|$|Faithful DNA {{replication}} {{is essential}} to all life. Hydroxyurea (HU) depletes the cells of dNTPs, which initially results in stalled <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> that, after prolonged treatment, collapse into DSBs. Here, we report that stalled <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> are efficiently restarted in a RAD 51 -dependent process that does not trigger homologous recombination (HR). The XRCC 3 protein, which is required for RAD 51 foci formation, is also required for replication restart of HU-stalled forks, suggesting that RAD 51 -mediated strand invasion supports fork restart. In contrast, <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> collapsed by prolonged replication blocks do not restart, and global replication is rescued by new origin firing. We find that RAD 51 -dependent HR is triggered for repair of collapsed <b>replication</b> <b>forks,</b> without apparent restart. In conclusion, our data suggest that restart of stalled <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> and HR repair of collapsed <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> require two distinct RAD 51 -mediated pathways...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in HepA-related protein (HARP) are {{the only}} {{identified}} causes of Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia (SIOD). HARP has a unique annealing helicase activity in vitro, but the in vivo functional significance remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated that HARP is recruited to stalled <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> via its direct interaction with Replication protein A (RPA). Cells with HARP depletion displayed increased spontaneous DNA damage and G 2 /M arrest, suggesting that HARP normally acts to stabilize stalled <b>replication</b> <b>forks.</b> Our data place the annealing helicase activity of HARP at <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> and propose that SIOD syndrome {{may be caused by}} the destabilization of <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> during cell proliferation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe DNA helicase RecQ is {{required}} for proper induction of the SOS response to replication stress in Escherichia coli. Unwinding of stalled <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> by RecQ family helicases in bacteria, and possibly in eukaryotes, may provide a means of damage signaling and recovering stalled <b>replication</b> <b>forks...</b>|$|R
5|$|A bypass {{platform}} is provided to these polymerases by Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Under normal circumstances, PCNA bound to polymerases replicates the DNA. At {{a site of}} lesion, PCNA is ubiquitinated, or modified, by the RAD6/RAD18 proteins to provide a platform for the specialized polymerases to bypass the lesion and resume DNA replication. After translesion synthesis, extension is required. This extension {{can be carried out}} by a replicative polymerase if the TLS is error-free, {{as in the case of}} Pol η, yet if TLS results in a mismatch, a specialized polymerase is needed to extend it; Pol ζ. Pol ζ is unique in that it can extend terminal mismatches, whereas more processive polymerases cannot. So when a lesion is encountered, the <b>replication</b> <b>fork</b> will stall, PCNA will switch from a processive polymerase to a TLS polymerase such as Pol ι to fix the lesion, then PCNA may switch to Pol ζ to extend the mismatch, and last PCNA will switch to the processive polymerase to continue replication.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{replication}} at the <b>replication</b> <b>fork</b> can be halted by {{a shortage}} of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) or by DNA damage, resulting in replication stress. This halting of replication {{is described as a}} stalled <b>replication</b> <b>fork.</b> A fork protection complex of proteins stabilizes the <b>replication</b> <b>fork</b> until DNA damage or other replication problems can be fixed. Prolonged <b>replication</b> <b>fork</b> stalling can lead to further DNA damage. Stalling signals are deactivated if the problems causing the <b>replication</b> <b>fork</b> are resolved.|$|E
25|$|During DNA replication, the {{replisome}} will unwind {{the parental}} duplex DNA into a two single-stranded DNA template <b>replication</b> <b>fork</b> in a 5' to 3' direction. The leading strand is the template strand {{that is being}} replicated {{in the same direction}} as the movement of the <b>replication</b> <b>fork.</b> This allows the newly synthesized strand complementary to the original strand to be synthesized 5' to 3' {{in the same direction as}} the movement of the <b>replication</b> <b>fork.</b>|$|E
40|$|Replication of {{the genome}} is crucial for the {{accurate}} transmission of genetic information. It has become clear {{over the last decade}} that the orderly progression of <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes is disrupted with high frequency by encounters with various obstacles either on or in the template strands. Survival of the organism then becomes dependent on both removal of the obstruction and resumption of replication. This latter point is particularly important in bacteria, where the number of <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> per genome is nominally only two. Replication restart in Escherichia coli is accomplished by the action of the restart primosomal proteins, which use both recombination intermediates and stalled <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> as substrates for loading new <b>replication</b> <b>forks.</b> These reactions have been reconstituted with purified recombination and replication proteins...|$|R
40|$|DNA damage can arrest <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> during S phase. Failure to {{stabilize}} and restart arrested forks results in fork collapse and genomic instability. In {{this issue of}} Cancer Cell, Schlacher et al. show that the Fanconi anemia and BRCA 2 tumor suppressor pathways cooperate to protect stalled <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> from degradation...|$|R
5000|$|Strategies {{involving}} combing recently replicated DNA typically involve incorporating modified nucleotides (such as BrdU, bromodeoxyuridine) {{into the}} nascent DNA, then fluorescently detecting it. As <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> spread bidirectionally from origins of replication at (approximately) equal speeds, then origin position can be inferred. Replacing the modified nucleotide pool {{with a different}} type of modified nucleotide after {{a certain amount of time}} allows development of a time-resolved picture of the firing of sites, and the kinetics of <b>replication</b> <b>forks.</b> Pause sites can be identified, merged <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> resolved, and the frequency of origin firings in different time periods to be studied.|$|R
25|$|DNA {{is always}} {{synthesized}} in the 5' to 3' direction. Since the leading and lagging strand templates are oriented {{in opposite directions}} at the <b>replication</b> <b>fork,</b> a major issue is how to achieve synthesis of nascent (new) lagging strand DNA, whose direction of synthesis is opposite to {{the direction of the}} growing <b>replication</b> <b>fork.</b>|$|E
25|$|The DNA helicases and polymerases {{must remain}} {{in close contact}} at the <b>replication</b> <b>fork.</b> If {{unwinding}} occurs too far in advance of synthesis, large tracts of single-stranded DNA are exposed. This can activate DNA damage signaling or induce DNA repair processes. To thwart these problems, the eukaryotic replisome contains specialized proteins {{that are designed to}} regulate the helicase activity ahead of the <b>replication</b> <b>fork.</b> These proteins also provide docking sites for physical interaction between helicases and polymerases, thereby ensuring that duplex unwinding is coupled with DNA synthesis.|$|E
25|$|In {{eukaryotic}} cells, {{termination of}} replication usually occurs through {{the collision of}} the two replicative forks between two active replication origins. The location of the collision varies on the timing of origin firing. In this way, if a <b>replication</b> <b>fork</b> becomes stalled or collapses at a certain site, replication of the site can be rescued when a replisome traveling {{in the opposite direction}} completes copying the region. There are programmed <b>replication</b> <b>fork</b> barriers (RFBs) bound by RFB proteins in various locations, throughout the genome, which are able to terminate or pause replication forks, stopping progression of the replisome.|$|E
25|$|By {{firing of}} {{replication}} origins, controlled spatially and temporally, {{the formation of}} replication foci is regulated. D. A. Jackson et al.(1998) revealed that neighboring origins fire simultaneously in mammalian cells. Spatial juxtaposition of replication sites brings clustering of <b>replication</b> <b>forks.</b> The clustering do rescue of stalled <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> and favors normal progress of <b>replication</b> <b>forks.</b> Progress of <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> is inhibited by many factors; collision with proteins or with complexes binding strongly on DNA, deficiency of dNTPs, nicks on template DNAs and so on. If <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> stall and the remaining sequences from the stalled forks are not replicated, the daughter strands have nick obtained un-replicated sites. The un-replicated sites on one parent's strand hold the other strand together but not daughter strands. Therefore, the resulting sister chromatids cannot separate {{from each other and}} cannot divide into 2 daughter cells. When neighboring origins fire and a fork from one origin is stalled, fork from other origin access on an opposite direction of the stalled fork and duplicate the un-replicated sites. As other mechanism of the rescue there is application of dormant replication origins that excess origins don't fire in normal DNA replication.|$|R
40|$|The Mrc 1 and Tof 1 {{proteins}} are conserved throughout evolution, and in {{budding yeast}} {{they are known}} to associate with the MCM helicase and regulate the progression of DNA <b>replication</b> <b>forks.</b> Previous work has shown that Mrc 1 {{is important for the}} activation of checkpoint kinases in responses to defects in S phase, but both Mrc 1 and Tof 1 also regulate the normal process of chromosome replication. Here, we show that these two important factors control the normal progression of DNA <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> in distinct ways. The rate of progression of DNA <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> is greatly reduced in the absence of Mrc 1 but much less affected by loss of Tof 1. In contrast, Tof 1 is critical for DNA <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> to pause at diverse chromosomal sites where nonnucleosomal proteins bind very tightly to DNA, and this role is not shared with Mrc 1...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a method which allows determination of {{the direction in which}} <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> move through segments of chromosomal DNA for which cloned probes are available. The method is based on the facts that DNA restriction fragments containing <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> migrate more slowly through agarose gels than do non-fork-containing fragments and that the extent of retardation of the fork-containing fragments {{is a function of the}} extent of replication. The procedure allows the identification of DNA replication origins as sites from which <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> diverge. In this paper we demonstrate the feasibility of this procedure, with simian virus 40 DNA as a model, and we discuss its applicability to other systems...|$|R
25|$|Eukaryotic DNA must be tightly {{compacted}} {{in order}} to fit within the confined space of the nucleus. Chromosomes are packaged by wrapping 147 nucleotides around an octamer of histone proteins, forming a nucleosome. The nucleosome octamer includes two copies of each histone H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Due to the tight association of histone proteins to DNA, eukaryotic cells have proteins {{that are designed to}} remodel histones ahead of the <b>replication</b> <b>fork,</b> {{in order to}} allow smooth progression of the replisome. There are also proteins involved in reassembling histones behind the <b>replication</b> <b>fork</b> to reestablish the nucleosome conformation.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{replication}} is {{the action}} of DNA polymerases synthesizing a DNA strand complementary to the original template strand. To synthesize DNA, the double-stranded DNA is unwound by DNA helicases ahead of polymerases, forming a <b>replication</b> <b>fork</b> containing two single-stranded templates. Replication processes permit the copying of a single DNA double helix into two DNA helices, which are divided into the daughter cells at mitosis. The major enzymatic functions carried out at the <b>replication</b> <b>fork</b> are well conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, but the replication machinery in eukaryotic DNA replication is a much larger complex, coordinating many proteins {{at the site of}} replication, forming the replisome.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{replication}} on the {{lagging strand}} is discontinuous. In lagging strand synthesis, {{the movement of}} DNA polymerase {{in the opposite direction}} of the <b>replication</b> <b>fork</b> requires the use of multiple RNA primers. DNA polymerase will synthesize short fragments of DNA called Okazaki fragments which are added to the 3' end of the primer. These fragments can be anywhere between 100-400 nucleotides long in eukaryotes.|$|E
40|$|SummaryOne envisioned {{function}} of homologous recombination (HR) {{is to find}} a template for DNA synthesis from the resected 3 ′-OH molecules that occur during double-strand break (DSB) repair at collapsed <b>replication</b> <b>forks.</b> However, the interplay between DNA synthesis and HR remains poorly understood in higher eukaryotic cells. Here, we reveal functions for the breast cancer proteins BRCA 2 and PALB 2 at blocked <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> and show a role for these proteins in stimulating polymerase η (Polη) to initiate DNA synthesis. PALB 2, BRCA 2, and Polη colocalize at stalled or collapsed <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> after hydroxyurea treatment. Moreover, PALB 2 and BRCA 2 interact with Polη and are required to sustain the recruitment of Polη at blocked <b>replication</b> <b>forks.</b> PALB 2 and BRCA 2 stimulate Polη-dependent DNA synthesis on D loop substrates. We conclude that PALB 2 and BRCA 2, in addition to their functions in D loop formation, play crucial roles in the initiation of recombination-associated DNA synthesis by Polη-mediated DNA repair...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe genome of {{the budding}} yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is sequenced and the {{location}} and dynamic of activation of DNA replication origins are known. G 1 synchronized yeast cells can be released into S-phase {{in the presence of}} hydroxyurea (HU) (1), which slows down DNA replication and retains <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> in proximity of DNA replication origins. In this condition, the Chromatin Immuno-Precipitation on chip (ChIP on chip) (2 – 4) of replisome components allows the precise localization of all active DNA <b>replication</b> <b>forks.</b> This analysis can be coupled with the ssDNA-BromodeoxyUridine (ssDNA-BrdU) Immuno-Precipitation on chip (ssDNA-BrdU IP on chip) technique (5 – 7), which detects the location of newly synthesized DNA. Comparison of binding and BrdU incorporation profiles allows to locate a factor of interest at DNA <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> genome wide. We present datasets deposited in the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database under accession number GSE 68214, which show how the DNA helicases Rrm 3 and Pif 1 (8) associate to active and inactive DNA <b>replication</b> <b>forks...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{stabilization}} and processing of stalled <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> {{is required to}} maintain genome integrity in all organisms. In an effort to identify novel proteins that might be involved in stabilizing stalled <b>replication</b> <b>forks,</b> Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant wss 1 D was isolated from a high-throughput screening of 5000 deletion strains for genes involved in the response to continuous, low-intensity UV irradiation. Disrup-tion of WSS 1 resulted in synergistic increases in UV sensitivity with null mutants of genes involved in recombination (RAD 52) and cell cycle control (RAD 9 and RAD 24). WSS 1 was also found to interact genetically with SGS 1, TOP 3, SRS 2 and CTF 4, which are involved in recombination, repair of <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> {{and the establishment of}} sister chromatid cohesion. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified a potential physical interaction between Wss 1 and both Psy 2 and Tof 1. Genetic interactions were also detected between PSY 2 and TOF 1, as well as between each gene and RAD 52 and SRS 2, and between WSS 1 and TOF 1. Tof 1 is known to be involved in stabilizing stalled <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> and our data suggest that Wss 1 and Psy 2 similarly function to stabilize or process stalled or collapsed <b>replication</b> <b>forks...</b>|$|R
25|$|Termination {{requires}} that {{the progress of the}} DNA <b>replication</b> <b>fork</b> must stop or be blocked. Termination at a specific locus, when it occurs, involves the interaction between two components: (1) a termination site sequence in the DNA, and (2) a protein which binds to this sequence to physically stop DNA replication. In various bacterial species, this is named the DNA replication terminus site-binding protein, or Ter protein.|$|E
25|$|Mrc1/Claspin {{proteins}} couple leading-strand synthesis {{with the}} CMG complex helicase activity. Mrc1 interacts with polymerase ε {{as well as}} Mcm proteins. The importance of this direct link between the helicase and the leading-strand polymerase is underscored by results in cultured human cells, where Mrc1/Claspin is required for efficient <b>replication</b> <b>fork</b> progression. These results suggest that efficient DNA replication also requires the coupling of helicases and leading-strand synthesis...|$|E
25|$|Because {{bacteria}} have circular chromosomes, {{termination of}} replication {{occurs when the}} two replication forks meet {{each other on the}} opposite end of the parental chromosome. E. coli regulates this process through the use of termination sequences that, when bound by the Tus protein, enable only one direction of <b>replication</b> <b>fork</b> to pass through. As a result, the replication forks are constrained to always meet within the termination region of the chromosome.|$|E
40|$|Replicative helicases unwind {{double-stranded}} DNA {{in front}} of the polymerase and ensure the processivity of DNA synthesis. In Escherichia coli, the helicase loader DnaC as well as factors involved {{in the formation of the}} open complex during the initiation of replication and primosomal proteins during the reactivation of arrested <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> are required to recruit and deposit the replicative helicase onto single-stranded DNA prior to the formation of the replisome. dnaC 2 is a thermosensitive allele of the gene specifying the helicase loader; at non-permissive temperature replication cannot initiate, but most ongoing rounds of replication continues through to completion (18 % of dnaC 2 cells fail to complete replication at non-permissive temperature). An assumption, which may be drawn from this observation, is that only a few <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> are arrested under normal growth conditions. This assumption, however, is at odds with the severe and deleterious phenotypes associated with a null mutant of priA, the gene encoding a helicase implicated in the reactivation of arrested <b>replication</b> <b>forks.</b> We developed an assay that involves an abrupt inactivation of rounds of synchronized replication in a large population of cells, in order to evaluate the ability of dnaC 2 cells to reactivate arrested <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> at non-permissive temperature. We compared the rate at which arrested <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> accumulated in dnaC 2 priA + and dnaC 2 priA 2 cells and observed that this rate was lower in dnaC 2 priA + cells. We conclude that while replication cannot initiate in a dnaC 2 mutant at non-permissive temperature, a class of arrested <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> (PriA-dependent and DnaC-independent) ar...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn all organisms several {{enzymes that}} are needed upon {{replication}} impediment are targeted to <b>replication</b> <b>forks</b> by interaction with a replication protein.

25|$|Another histone {{chaperone}} that {{associates with}} the replisome is Asf1, which {{interacts with the}} Mcm complex dependent on histone dimers H3-H4. Asf1 is able to pass newly synthesized H3-H4 dimer to deposition factors behind the <b>replication</b> <b>fork</b> and this activity makes the H3-H4 histone dimers available {{at the site of}} histone deposition just after replication. Asf1 (and its partner Rtt109) has also been implicated in inhibiting gene expression from replicated genes during S-phase.|$|E
25|$|After the replicative helicase has unwound {{the parental}} DNA duplex, exposing two {{single-stranded}} DNA templates, replicative polymerases {{are needed to}} generate two copies of the parental genome. DNA polymerase function is highly specialized and accomplish replication on specific templates and in narrow localizations. At the eukaryotic <b>replication</b> <b>fork,</b> there are three distinct replicative polymerase complexes that contribute to DNA replication: Polymerase α, Polymerase δ, and Polymerase ε.

25|$|PCNA fully encircles the DNA {{template}} strand {{and must be}} loaded onto DNA at the <b>replication</b> <b>fork.</b> At the leading strand, loading of the PCNA is an infrequent process, because DNA replication on the leading strand is continuous until replication is terminated.
