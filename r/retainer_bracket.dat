30|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{has been used}} to study configurations of speech organs in the resting state. However, MRI is sensitive to metals, and numerous types of metallic appliances, most of which have a large magnetic susceptibility, are used in orthodontic treatment and may cause severe artifacts on MRI. We have developed techniques for obtaining MRI movies of the oral region, to evaluate articulatory changes, especially movement of the tongue, palate, and teeth, pre- and post-orthodontic/orthognathic treatment. We evaluated the influence of artifacts caused by orthodontic appliances, including fixed <b>retainers,</b> metal <b>brackets,</b> and wires, on measurements in 3 -T MRI movies.|$|R
40|$|Little's Irregularity Index (LII) was {{devised to}} objectively score mandibular incisor {{alignment}} for epidemiological studies {{but has been}} extended to assess the relative performance of orthodontic <b>brackets,</b> <b>retainer</b> or treatment modalities. Our aim {{was to examine the}} repeatability and precision of LII measurements of four independent examiners on the maxillary arch of orthodontic patients. The hypothesis was that the reproducibility of individual contact point displacement measurements, used to calculate the LII score, are inappropriate...|$|R
30|$|Orthodontic appliances, {{including}} metallic materials, {{may produce}} a significant error in {{measurement of the}} articulatory organs when using MRI movie images. Metallic orthodontic appliances such as the fixed <b>retainer</b> and metal <b>brackets</b> often make anatomical structures disappear and become distorted by signal void caused by metallic artifact. When the velum is evaluated in a distorted image, caution should be exercised as the measurement may be altered. In conclusion, the influence on MRI examination varies among orthodontic metallic appliances and orthodontists should not necessarily remove all metallic appliances before MRI examination. Meanwhile, orthodontists should know {{the fact that a}} significant measurement error in speech evaluation using MRI movie may occur by image distortion caused by metallic artifacts and share the information with radiologists.|$|R
30|$|Sixteen healthy {{young adults}} (nine males, seven females; average age, 27 Â years) with normal {{occlusion}} were recruited. Four types of customized maxillary and mandibular plates were prepared by incorporating {{one of the}} following into the plate: (a) nothing, (b) a fixed canine-to-canine <b>retainer,</b> (c) metal <b>brackets</b> for the anterior and molar teeth, or (d) clear brackets for the anterior teeth and metal brackets for molars. A 3 -T MRI movie, in segmented cine mode, was generated for each plate condition while participants pronounced a vowel-consonant-vowel syllable (/asa/). The size of the artifact due to the metallic brackets was measured. The face size and orthodontically important anatomical structures, such as the velum, the hard palate, and the laryngeal ventricle, were also measured.|$|R
