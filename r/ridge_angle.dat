40|$|Introduction: Cleft lip (CL) and {{cleft palate}} (CP) {{are among the}} most common {{congenital}} anomalies. Constituting 65 % of head and neck anomalies in isolated or syndromic forms, they are considered as the most common head and neck congenital deformities in children. Methods: 15 children from the Tabriz Children Hospital were evaluated in this descriptive-analytic cross sectional study that possessed unilateral and bilateral cleft lip and palate with inclusion criteria. The effect of nasal floor reconstruction on the size of alveolar cleft and palatal anterior fistula formation were evaluated in primary unilateral and bilateral cleft palate. Results: There were 11 (73. 3 %) male and only 4 (26. 7 %) female patients in the sample group. The mean duration from first consult to reconstructive surgery was 3. 4 ± 1. 8 months (1 to 9 months range). The width of alveolar cleft and alveolar <b>ridge</b> <b>angle</b> on cleft side compared to normal side in sagittal and coronal axis was significant after nasal floor reconstruction (P= 0. 001, P= 0. 02), while septal angle changes were not significant (P= 0. 26), which means no increase in septal deviation has been documented. Conclusion: Considering the significant changes of alveolar cleft width and alveolar <b>ridge</b> <b>angle</b> on cleft side compared to normal side in sagittal and coronal axis after nasal floor closure, this method can be applied as a new interventional surgery in primary unilateral and bilateral cleft palate...|$|E
40|$|An {{electrochemical}} etching {{approach was}} developed to fabricate self-similar nano- and microscale pyramid structures on single-crystal gold (1 0 0) surfaces. Using their unique self-similar characteristics, pyramids of (1 1 4) facets were compressed to study the length scale effects in the contact pressure and plastic deformation. At first, many pyramids were compressed simultaneously with a flat mica sheet to measure the <b>ridge</b> <b>angle</b> changes of the deformed pyramids {{with respect to the}} sizes of the flattened area. The <b>ridge</b> <b>angle</b> changes were scattered between approximately 2 ° and 13 ° for compression displacements of 50 – 350 nm, in contrast to the perfect plasticity prediction of − 4. 7 °. Then, individual pyramids isolated with a focused ion beam were compressed with a flat tip nanoindenter for displacements of approximately 10 – 100 nm to obtain the relationship between the contact pressure and the compression depth. The plastic deformation-adjusted contact pressure evaluated by taking into account the initial 6 – 14 nm roundness offset of the pyramids is characterized by an initial increase up to approximately 2. 5 GPa for a shallow compression depth within 10 nm followed by a gradual decay to approximately 450 MPa at a compression depth of 100 nm. This pressure seems to be still decaying towards an asymptotic value predicted by a continuum limit analysis. Given the size and self-similar nature of the pyramids, various mechanisms could possibly contribute to the observed scale dependence. The current study provides valuable experimental evidence for size-dependent material behavior at small length scales...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Nowadays, using {{implants}} as {{a choice}} in patient's treatment plans has become popular. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of mandibular lingual and maxillary buccal concavity, mean concavity depth and angle and its relation to age and gender. Materials and Methods: In 200 CBCT, concavity depth and angle were measured in 2 mm superior to the inferior alveolar canal in the mandibular first molar area and in 1 mm distance from nasal floor in the midpoint region of maxillary lateral incisor and canine. Concavity depth and angle relationships with age and gender have been evaluated using Spearman Correlation and a t-test. Results: Mean and standard deviation of lingual concavity, concavity angle and <b>ridge</b> <b>angle</b> in mandible were 1. 3 ± 1. 54 mm, 15. 45 ± 16. 19 and 10. 13 ± 6. 1. Mean and standard deviation of buccal concavity and concavity angle in maxilla were 5. 35 ± 1. 03 mm and 30. 6 ± 5. 75. Mandibular concavity depth was zero in 44 % of subjects and more than zero in 56 %. Results were more than 3 mm in maxillary samples. There was a linear relationship between mandibular concavity depth and age equaled to - 0. 27, p= 0. 007 and for mandibular concavity angle and age equaled to - 0. 25, p= 0. 01. There was no significant relationship between mandibular <b>ridge</b> <b>angle</b> and age. In maxilla, there was no linear relationship between age and gender with any other variables Conclusion: It is necessary to provide more information on these regions' anatomy using CBCT cross sections before implant placement...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the equilibrium shapes of a thin, annular strip cut {{out in an}} elastic sheet. When a central fold is formed by creasing beyond the elastic limit, the strip has been observed to buckle out-of-plane. Starting from the theory of elastic plates, we derive a Kirchhoff rod model for the folded strip. A non-linear effective constitutive law incorporating the underlying geometrical constraints is derived, in which the angle the ridge appears as an internal degree of freedom. By contrast with traditional thin- walled beam models, this constitutive law captures large, non-rigid deformations of the cross-sections, including finite variations of the dihedral angle at the ridge. Using this effective rod theory, we identify a buckling instability that produces the out-of-plane configurations of the folded strip, and show that the strip behaves as an elastic ring having one frozen mode of curvature. In addition, we point out two novel buckling patterns: one where the centerline remains planar and the <b>ridge</b> <b>angle</b> is modulated; another one where the bending deformation is localized. These patterns are observed experimentally, explained based on stability analyses, and reproduced in simulations of the post-buckled configurations...|$|E

In this paper we present the numerical results for fully developed laminar and turbulent flow and heat transfer in a channel with triangular riblets. The turbulent study is performed {{by means of}} direct numerical simulation at a Reynolds number Re_τ = 180 based on the wall-shear velocity, for a fluid with a Prandtl number Pr= 0. 71. Four different ribbed channels are considered, under a constant heat flux boundary condition, and correspond to <b>ridge</b> <b>angle</b> a α = 45 and 60 degrees, and riblet spacing s^+ = 20 and s^+ = 40.

The predicted heat transfer efficiency of riblets {{do not agree with}} some experimental results, and is below that of a flat plate for all the configurations.

The wear {{analysis}} of chisel-edge ruling tool for diffraction gratings is very complex because of following two reasons {{that one is}} the wear distribution on edge after grating ruling is too minute so that hard to find and measured by conventional equipment like microscope, {{and the other is}} the effect of wear on the groove depth, pitch, <b>ridge,</b> blaze <b>angle,</b> non-blaze angle, groove bottom angle and diffraction efficiency of gratings.

40|$|V-shaped ridge {{components}} of the herringbone pattern associated with lunar secondary crater chains have been simulated by simultaneous and nearly simultaneous impact of two projectiles near one another. The impact velocities and angles of the projectiles {{were similar to those}} of the fragments that produced secondary craters found at various ranges from large lunar craters. Variables found to affect the included angles of the V-shaped ridges are: relative time of impact of the projectiles, impact angle, relative projectile mass, and azimuth angle of the crater chain relative to the projection of the flight line onto the target surface. The functional relationships between the forms of the ridges and many of these variables are similar to those observed for lunar V-shaped ridges.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the elastic buckling of a triangular prism {{made of a}} soft elastomer. A face of the prism is bonded to a stiff slab that imposes an average axial compression. We observe two possible buckling modes which are localized along the free <b>ridge.</b> For <b>ridge</b> <b>angles</b> ϕ below a critical value ϕ^≈ 90 ^∘ experiments reveal an extended sinusoidal mode, while for ϕ above ϕ^ we observe a series of creases progressively invading the lateral faces starting from the ridge. A numerical linear stability analysis is set up using the finite-element method and correctly predicts the sinusoidal mode for ϕ≤ϕ^, {{as well as the}} associated critical strain ϵ_c(ϕ). The experimental transition at ϕ^ is found to occur when this critical strain ϵ_c(ϕ) attains the value ϵ_c(ϕ^) = 0. 44 corresponding to the threshold of the sub-critical surface creasing instability. Previous analyses have focused on elastic crease patterns appearing on planar surfaces, where the role of scale-invariance has been emphasized; our analysis of the elastic ridge provides a different perspective, and reveals that scale-invariance is not a sufficient condition for localization...|$|R

40|$|The snowball earth {{hypothesis}} is a unified theory {{accounting for the}} global distribution of Cryogenian (roughly 720 to 635 Ma) glacial and glacial marine deposits, their global synchroneity demonstrated by chemostratigraphy, and their close association with thick carbonate strata and sedimentary iron deposits (banded iron formation) in certain areas. It postulates that on two separate occasions, around 710 and 640 Ma, the ocean froze over from pole to pole for long periods (i. e., millions of years). The postulate has been widely criticized as being incompatible with the glacial sedimentary record indicating the former existence of fast-moving wet-base ice and open proglacial waters. The younger Cryogenian glaciation in northern Namibia presents an excellent opportunity to investigate the sedimentary record. The area was then a vast shallow-water carbonate platform situated in the tropics or subtropics. The platform had a sharply-defined southern edge, beyond which a stratigraphically tapered foreslope wedge descended into deep waters of the northern Damara extended terrain. The platform and foreslope were undergoing broad regional subsidence with no local structural deformation {{at the time of}} the younger glaciation. The Fransfontein Ridge (a present physiographic feature) is a simple homocline exposing a continuous 60 -km-long section of the foreslope wedge. The western two-thirds of the ridge parallels the paleoslope contours 6 to 10 km south of the foreslope-platform break, where the seafloor would have been 550 to 800 m below the top of the platform based on modern analogs.

40|$|Tooth plate {{formation}} in the Queensland lungfish, Neoceratodus forsteri, Krefft begins with simple groups of isolated cusps, three in each tooth plate. The cusps fuse in ridges radiating from a point situated posterolingually. During growth, cusps {{are added to the}} labial ends of the ridges, and more ridges are added posteriorly, giving a total of seven in each tooth plate. Each tooth grows in thickness by the addition of layers of material, in line with the new cusps, beneath the tooth plate. The tooth plate grows outwards and is resorbed from the inner angle at the same time. The crushing surface is formed by the growth of cusps between the <b>ridges.</b> <b>Angles</b> between the <b>ridges</b> become progressively smaller, and angles between more posterior ridges are consistently less than between more anterior ridges. Similar but less pronounced changes in <b>angles</b> between <b>ridges</b> occur in a fossil genus, Sagenodus inaequalis, examined for comparison. Vomerine teeth grow in the same way, by fusion of isolated cusps and the addition of new cusps to one end (labial) of the tooth plate. Layers of material are also added beneath the tooth plate. The vomerine tooth plates are initially low-based with long cusps but develop into high-based low cusped incisiform tooth plates in fully grown adults. The labial dentition of the lower jaw starts to develop like the vomerine teeth, but degenerates by stage (vi) of tooth development. The single medial tooth is resorbed even earlier. The pattern of tooth plate formation described in this paper is consistent with illustrations published by Semon (1901) and Greil (1908, 1913) but the inferred developmental processes are different.
