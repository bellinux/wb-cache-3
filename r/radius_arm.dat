500|$|As {{with the}} extinctions that {{occurred}} on other land masses {{during the late}} Pleistocene and Holocene (known as the Quaternary extinction event), the disappearance of Madagascar's megafauna is tightly linked {{with the arrival of}} humans, with nearly all extinctions dating to around the same time of the earliest evidence of human activity on the island or significantly later. [...] The exact date of human arrival is unknown, although a <b>radius</b> (<b>arm</b> bone) of a Palaeopropithecus ingens with distinct cut marks from the removal of flesh with sharp objects dates to approximately 2325 ± 43 BP (2366–2315 cal yr BP). Based on this evidence from Taolambiby in the southwest interior, as well as other dates for human-modified dwarf hippo bones and introduced plant pollen {{from other parts of the}} island, the arrival of humans is conservatively estimated at approximately 350 cal yr BCE. [...] Measurements of stratigraphic charcoal and the appearance of exotic plant pollen dated from Holocene core samples confirm these approximated dates for human arrival in the southwestern corner of the island and further suggest that the central and northern parts of the island did not experience significant human impact until 700 to 1,500years later. [...] The humid forests of the lower interior of the island were the last to be settled (as shown by the presence of charcoal particles), possibly due to the prevalence of human diseases, such as plague, malaria, and dysentery. [...] The entire island was not fully colonized by humans until the beginning of the second millennium CE.|$|E
2500|$|The Trainer's {{undercarriage}} {{was unusual}} and possibly vulnerable. [...] Each wheel was {{mounted on a}} stub axle, independent of the other and swung on a V member formed from heavy duty square tubing, with its ends hinged to front and rear spar towards the outer end of the centre section, so the assembly could swing laterally. [...] Each V plus wheel was restrained by a <b>radius</b> <b>arm</b> hinged on the front spar near the fuselage, allowing {{a small amount of}} upwards and outward travel for the wheel. [...] The radius arms were sprung inside the fuselage. [...] In order to get the very wide track of 93 in (2.36 m), both the V and radius arms were heavily splayed and the angle between them was much smaller than normal, a cause for some concern. [...] The tailskid was mounted without a fuselage aperture, to avoid the trapping of grass and dirt.|$|E

2500|$|The Alizé was {{powered by}} an uncowled 110hp (82kW) Lorraine 5P engine, a five-cylinder radial. [...] It {{had a long}} exhaust pipe {{reaching}} under the aircraft rearwards, passing between the <b>radius</b> <b>arms</b> and ending below the forward cockpit.|$|R
50|$|The {{lower link}} {{itself is not}} {{designed}} to carry normal acceleration and braking forces, so it is located by two radius arms that run forward from each lower link to points on the (unitary construction) vehicle body, beneath the rear passenger compartment. Each <b>radius</b> <b>arm</b> attaches to its lower link at a point just outboard of the bottom spring mountings and pivots vertically about its fixing bolt. The fixing bolts pass through a small Metalastik bush, which consist of a metal sleeve held within a rubber bush. Where the <b>radius</b> <b>arm</b> meets the vehicle body, it is attached by a vertical bolt passing through a large Metalastic bush that is pressed into the forward end of the <b>radius</b> <b>arm.</b> Safety straps retain the radius arms in proximity to the vehicle body should one of the front securing bolts happen to come loose.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Representative {{drawing of}} Hooke's {{reflecting}} instrument. It does not accurately depict the fine {{details of the}} instrument but rather the basic functionality.The index with telescope mounted is shown in black, the <b>radius</b> <b>arm</b> with the mirror (grey) attached in blue and the chord in green on white. The lines of sight are represented by the red dashed line.|$|E
50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the <b>radius</b> <b>arm</b> forward attachments not being on the axis of the lower link arm inner pivots, it would appear at first glance that free movement of the suspension would be impossible without some components bending, or the trailing arm elastomeric bushes being compressed unduly. However, as described above, the crossbeam is rubber mounted to the body. The crossbeam and lower links maintain the correct toe angle of one wheel relative to the other, however due to the relative angles of the trailing radius arms, body roll results in the entire cross-beam and lower links pivoting slightly about the crossbeam's mounting points, thus inducing a small amount of passive rear wheel steering, which may result in significantly improved handling. When the Jaguar components are re-used in other vehicles, the differential is often rigidly mounted to the chassis, different <b>radius</b> <b>arm</b> configurations are used, and the passive rear wheel steering effect is lost.|$|E
50|$|The {{channel section}} chassis had {{suspension}} by leaf springs {{at the front}} and a mix of leaf springs and torsion bars at the rear. At the front semi-elliptical springs were used with <b>radius</b> <b>arms</b> controlling fore and aft movement of the axle. The <b>radius</b> <b>arms</b> were joined by a torsion bar {{across the front of}} the chassis to act as an anti-roll bar. At the rear the quarter-elliptical springs had their front ends mounted in a boss that was attached to a short transverse torsion bar which controlled the rotation of the boss making the suspension a hybrid arrangement. As at the front linked radius rods provided axle location and anti-roll properties.|$|R
50|$|A common {{example of}} this is the German V200 design and its many {{international}} derivatives. The need to arrange the bogie suspension around the drive shafts led to an unusual bogie design with <b>radius</b> <b>arms</b> rather than hornblocks and so prominently visible wheels and rims.|$|R
2500|$|... front it {{consisted}} of double wishbones, with a thick sheet steel (4mm) upper wishbone, lever-arm Houdaille hydraulic dampers, longitudinal torsion bars, and lower location through a transverse leaf spring; {{at the rear of}} swing axles and <b>radius</b> <b>arms,</b> with a transverse leaf spring and longitudinal torsion bars.|$|R
50|$|A {{radius rod}} (also called a <b>radius</b> <b>arm</b> or a torque arm) is a {{suspension}} link intended to control wheel {{motion in the}} longitudinal (fore-aft) direction. The link is connected (with a rubber or solid bushing) on {{one end to the}} wheel carrier or axle, on the other to the chassis or unibody of the vehicle. Radius rods are also sometimes used in aircraft with fixed (non retractable) undercarriages.|$|E
50|$|The rear {{suspension}} was fully independent, with double wishbone and <b>radius</b> <b>arm</b> configuration, incorporating anti-squat characteristics. The car was fitted with Armstrong adjustable dampers and spring platform adjustment. Coil springs were used. A separate adjustable anti-roll bar {{was included in}} the suspension. Outboard drive-shafts were hollowed out to reduce unsprung weight. Rear hub carriers were made of magnesium cast. The suspension operates entirely on adjustable rod-ends with provision for toe-in and camber adjustments.|$|E
50|$|The front {{suspension}} used {{very tall}} uprights with the wheel spindles {{on one side}} and a short stub axle extending inwards on the other. Springing was by vertically mounted coil-over-damper units mounted inboard and operated through rocker-style upper arms. The lower arms were conventional wide-based wishbones made of a one-piece wishbone and long <b>radius</b> <b>arm</b> running back towards the bulkhead. Steering was rack-and-pinion mounted high, at the same level as the upper wishbone.|$|E
50|$|The fixed-length {{driveshaft}} as {{the upper}} suspension link remained, but the lower wishbone became a fabricated steel box section {{with a much}} wider base. Putting {{the front and rear}} pivots of the wishbones so far apart meant that the <b>radius</b> <b>arms</b> could be (and were) eliminated.|$|R
5000|$|Independent {{front wheel}} {{springing}} was {{provided in the}} form of parallel links with coil springs, <b>radius</b> <b>arms</b> and torsion bar damping. The rear half-elliptical springs also were given a torsion bar stabilizer and hydraulic shock absorbers. They were rubber-mounted to minimise vibration. The exhaust system was also insulated.|$|R
50|$|T-669.0 (770) class diesel {{locomotive}}s, {{built by}} ČKD are six-axle, with two bogies. The wheel pairs {{are set in}} <b>radius</b> <b>arms</b> and have a simple coil spring suspension. The body is {{mounted on the frame}} with eight anchors. The locomotive is a hood unit type with an internal, eccentrically-positioned operator's cab.|$|R
5000|$|The rear {{suspension}} was a heavily {{modified version of}} the Chapman strut, originally developed for Chapman's earlier Formula racing car designs and used in the Lotus Elan. In the Europa, the vertical [...] "strut" [...] element pivots on the wheel hub at its lower end and doesn't control wheel camber angle as-in earlier Lotus designs. Wheel location and alignment is controlled instead by interaction between a fixed-length, articulated driveshaft top link, a simple tubular lower link, and a large box-section <b>radius</b> <b>arm</b> running diagonally forward to the chassis. These radius arms {{played a critical role in}} giving the precise tracking and handling desired, as the Chapman Strut's use of the driveshaft to resist lateral forces was compromised by the rubber engine and transaxle mounts needed to isolate vibrations from the car body. A careful compromise between the <b>radius</b> <b>arm</b> mount's stiffness, isolation and car handling was required, culminating eventually in a sandwich bush that was flexible against shear but stiff in compression and tension. The car's subsequent resulting handling prompted automotive writers to describe the Europa as the nearest thing to a Formula car for the road.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was mounted}} between the wings on central struts {{above and below}} and was circular in cross-section, tapering towards the tail. The horizontal tail surfaces were rectangular, and the rudder and wide chord fin formed a shallow triangle. There were two cockpits, seating the pilot under the wing and the gunner further aft with a large radiator between them. The 260 hp (120 kW) water-cooled Canton-Unné X-9 radial engine gave the HF.30A a short nose. Its simple conventional undercarriage had a single mainwheel on each main leg and <b>radius</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The 701's rear {{suspension}} {{was a relatively}} conservative twin link and <b>radius</b> <b>arm</b> system, with coilover spring and damper units mounted outboard of the car's bodywork, in the airflow. Double wishbone suspension was employed for the front wheels, which Herd described as [...] "slightly unconventional for a current formula 1 car", again with the spring and damper units mounted outboard. Herd attributed his choice of the double wishbone system to a desire to overcome the suspension geometry compromises necessary to accommodate the increasingly wide front tyres of contemporary Formula One, while outboard shock absorbers - despite aerodynamic disadvantages - provided advantages in simplicity, cooling and stress management.|$|E
25|$|The M7A was an open-wheeled {{single-seater}} with a mid-mounted engine {{driving the}} rear wheels. The chassis was a bathtub-type (i.e. open-topped) monocoque made from 22-gauge aluminium alloy and 20-gauge magnesium alloy panels glued and riveted {{together and to}} three steel bulkheads. The monocoque terminated behind the driver's seat and the engine {{was used as a}} stressed part of the chassis, bolted directly to the rearmost bulkhead. The gearbox was then attached behind the engine, and the rear suspension – consisting of lateral top links, twin <b>radius</b> <b>arms</b> and reversed wishbones– attached to the gearbox and the rear bulkhead. The front suspension – upper and lower lateral links and <b>radius</b> <b>arms</b> – and the steering column were attached to the two bulkheads in front of the driver. Coilover springs and Koni dampers mounted outside of the body were employed front and rear.|$|R
5000|$|The rear {{suspension}} incorporated twin <b>radius</b> <b>arms,</b> parallel links, Armstrong adjustable dampers, and fully adjustable spherical bearings throughout. The front suspension was a double-wide-based wishbone design with Armstrong adjustable dampers and fully adjustable spherical bearings throughout. The coil spring units for both {{front and rear}} were mounted inboard with [...] "Bowin variable rate spring control".|$|R
50|$|At the rear, {{above the}} second wing, {{was a small}} {{triangular}} fin which carried a rudder that extended {{to the bottom of}} the fuselage. The Peyret had a wider track and more refined undercarriage than many of the Itford gliders, with wheels on a single axle mounted below the fuselage on a combination of rubber shock absorbers and <b>radius</b> <b>arms</b> from the forward fuselage.|$|R
5000|$|The RAM Power Wagon {{will have}} a 6.4 Hemi V8 as the {{standard}} engine; the 5.7 Hemi V8 goes away. The 6.4 has 410 horsepower and is also available in standard Rams. The transmission and transfer case remain unchanged (Borg Warner 44-47). The axle gears change from 4.56:1 gear ratios to 4:10 gear ratios. The rear axle is now a 11.5 AAM axle (with selectable locker). The rear suspension now has a 5-link coil spring arrangement instead of leaf springs. The front suspension has been changed to a <b>radius</b> <b>arm</b> arrangement (3-link) instead of the 5-link used since 2005. Tires are now Goodyear Duratracs.|$|E

50|$|To {{be really}} successful, the MacPherson strut {{required}} {{the introduction of}} unitary construction, because it needs a substantial vertical space and a strong top mount, which unibodies can provide, while benefiting them by distributing stresses. The strut will usually carry both the coil spring on which the body is suspended and the shock absorber, which is usually {{in the form of}} a cartridge mounted within the strut (see coilover). The strut can also have the steering arm built into the lower outer portion. The whole assembly is very simple and can be preassembled into a unit; also by eliminating the upper control arm, it allows for more width in the engine compartment, which is useful for smaller cars, particularly with transverse-mounted engines such as most front wheel drive vehicles have. It can be further simplified, if needed, by substituting an anti-roll bar (torsion bar) for the <b>radius</b> <b>arm.</b> For those reasons, it has become almost ubiquitous with low cost manufacturers. Furthermore, it offers an easy method to set suspension geometry.|$|E
50|$|Created from an all {{fibreglass}} {{monocoque body}} reinforced with kevlar and carbon fibre at the mountings for extra strength. It used a classic mini front subframe and A-Series engine at the front, whilst {{at the rear}} a galvanised beam axle was used with classic mini <b>radius</b> <b>arms</b> and coilover suspension. The car had four seats and a boot area which could be accessed by tilting the rear seats.|$|R
50|$|The front {{suspension}} wishbones {{were similar}} to that of the E-Type, however where the E-Type used longitudinal torsion bars, the XJ13 had more conventional coil spring/damper units. At the rear there again remained similarities with the E-Type—the use of driveshafts as upper transverse links—however the rest was quite different, with two long <b>radius</b> <b>arms</b> per side angling back from the central body tub together with a single fabricated transverse lower link.|$|R
50|$|The {{shape of}} the {{subframe}} changed to an approximate triangle, bolted {{to the front of}} the differential and attached to the car at approximately the same points as the <b>radius</b> <b>arms</b> of the first generation IRS. The rear of the differential was further supported by a pair of link rods attaching it to the car's rear floor structure. Rubber bushes at the attachment points provided the necessary levels of NVH suppression.|$|R
50|$|The device {{consisted}} of three primary components, an index arm, a radial arm and a graduated chord. The three were arranged in a triangle as in {{the image on the}} right. A telescopic sight was mounted on the index arm. At the point of rotation of the radial arm, a single mirror was mounted. This point of rotation allowed the angle between the index arm and the radial arm to be changed. The graduated chord was connected to {{the opposite end of the}} radial arm and the chord was permitted to rotate about the end. The chord was held against the distant end of the index arm and slid against it. The graduations on the chord were uniform and, by using it to measure the distance between the ends of the index arm and the radial arm, the angle between those arms could be determined. A table of chords was used to convert a measurement of distance to a measurement of angle. The use of the mirror resulted in the measured angle being twice the angle included by the index and the <b>radius</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|E

The exact date of human arrival is unknown, although a <b>radius</b> (<b>arm</b> bone) of a Palaeopropithecus ingens with distinct cut marks from the removal of flesh with sharp objects dates to approximately 2325 ± 43 BP (2366-2315 cal yr BP).

40|$|A tool {{is shown}} having {{a cross beam}} {{assembly}} (15) made of beams (18, 19, 20, 21) joined by a center box structure (23). The assembly (15) is adapted to be mounted by brackets (16) to the outer end of a cylindrical case (11). The center box structure (23) has a vertical shaft (25) rotatably mounted therein and extending beneath the assembly (15). Secured to the vertical shaft (25) is a <b>radius</b> <b>arm</b> (28) which is adapted to rotate with shaft (25). On the longer end of the <b>radius</b> <b>arm</b> (28) is a measuring tip (30) which contacts the cylindrical surface to be measured and which provides an electric signal representing the radius of the cylindrical surface {{from the center of}} rotation of the <b>radius</b> <b>arm</b> (28). An electric servomotor (49) rotates the vertical shaft (25) and an electronic resolver (61) provides an electric signal representing the angle of rotation of the shaft (25). The electric signals are provided to a computer station (73) which has software for its computer to calculate and print out the continuous circumference profile of the cylindrical surface, and give its true diameter and the deviations from the ideal circle...|$|E
50|$|The tie-rod end, front top {{and bottom}} {{wishbone}} outside joints and the rear lower wishbone inside joint were Heim joints. The rest of the suspension joints were rubber joint, with joint-mounting pipes welded onto the ends of suspension arms. While most of the suspension arms were in common with Lotus 22, {{the angle of the}} rear <b>radius</b> <b>arms</b> on the plan view was different from the narrower-frame Lotus 22, so they were not interchangeable with the 22.|$|R
5000|$|Lotus 59 {{originally}} came in two versions; 59 for Formula 3 and Formula Ford, 59B for Formula 2 and Formula B, all {{sharing the}} same 92.5" [...] wheelbase, which was 2.5" [...] longer than the previous 41/41X. Suspension was very conventional with double wishbone and outboard spring/damper unit up front, with top link and lower reversed wishbone combined with upper and lower <b>radius</b> <b>arms</b> and outboard spring/damper unit in the rear. Brakes were outboard {{in the front and}} rear.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{insulate}} the passenger compartment from noise, vibration and harshness (NVH), the {{independent rear suspension}} {{was designed to be}} carried in a separate crossbeam assembly attached to the vehicle body by four rubber vee-blocks. The only other points of contact with the vehicle body (i.e. the <b>radius</b> <b>arms)</b> are by means of metal sleeved (Metalastik) rubber bushes, so there is no metal-to-metal contact between the suspension and vehicle body. The fabricated steel crossbeam carries the differential and inboard brakes (if fitted).|$|R
