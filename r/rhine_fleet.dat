25|$|During the Batavian {{rebellion}} of Gaius Julius Civilis (69-70), {{the rebels}} {{got hold of}} a squadron of the <b>Rhine</b> <b>fleet</b> by treachery, and the conflict featured frequent use of the Roman Rhine flotilla. In the last phase of the war, the British fleet and legio XIV were brought in from Britain to attack the Batavian coast, but the Cananefates, allies of the Batavians, were able to destroy or capture {{a large part of}} the fleet. In the meantime, the new Roman commander, Quintus Petillius Cerialis, advanced north and constructed a new fleet. Civilis attempted only a short encounter with his own fleet, but could not hinder the superior Roman force from landing and ravaging the island of the Batavians, leading to the negotiation of a peace soon after.|$|E
50|$|Constantius I led the <b>Rhine</b> <b>fleet</b> {{against the}} Alemanni in 298 AD, who had {{settled on a}} river island. His son and {{successor}} Constantine the Great modernized the <b>Rhine</b> <b>fleet</b> and replaced the liburnarii entirely with lusoriae. This made the Upper <b>Rhine</b> <b>fleet</b> operational. In 306 Constantine brought troops across the Rhine and ravaged the settlement areas of the Bructeri tribe, before returning the <b>Rhine</b> <b>fleet</b> back into Germanic territory in 313.|$|E

50|$|Ireland {{had been}} at war since the {{rebellion}} of 1641, {{with most of the}} island being controlled by the Irish Confederates. In 1648, in the wake of Charles I's arrest, and the growing threat to them from the armies of the English Parliament, the Confederates signed a treaty of alliance with the English Royalists. The joint Royalist and Confederate forces under Ormonde attempted to eliminate the Parliamentary army holding Dublin, but were routed at the battle of Rathmines by a Parliamentary army commanded by Colonel Michael Jones. As the former Member of Parliament Admiral Robert Blake blockaded Prince Rupert of the <b>Rhine's</b> <b>fleet</b> in Kinsale, Oliver Cromwell was able to land at Dublin on 15 August 1649 with the army to quell Royalist alliance in Ireland. The alliance, which was a compromise that gave command of the Irish Confederate forces to the English Royalists, was very shaky from the start, with many Confederates unhappy with the leadership of Ormonde. Indeed, the Confederates had fought a mini civil war among themselves in 1648 over this alliance, with Owen Roe O'Neill's Ulster army leaving the Confederation and only re-joining it after Cromwell had actually landed in Ireland.|$|R
5000|$|The Battles of Schooneveld {{were two}} naval {{battles of the}} Franco-Dutch War, fought {{off the coast of}} the Netherlands on 7 June and 14 June 1673 (New Style; 28 May and 4 June in the Julian {{calendar}} then in use in England) between an allied Anglo-French fleet commanded by Prince Rupert of the <b>Rhine,</b> and the <b>fleet</b> of the United Provinces, commanded by Michiel de Ruyter.|$|R
50|$|The {{types of}} vessels {{that made up}} the <b>Rhine</b> <b>fleet</b> {{consisted}} of freighters (Navis actuaria), rafts, transports as well as some heavy warships. They could be rowed and sailed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{headquarters}} of the Classis Germanica was originally located in [...] (in Xanten), later in the [...] The main city of Germania inferior was Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium (CCAA), capital of the province, an important economic center and a trading center of great national importance. The Rhine in turn served not only as an important transport route for the transport of goods produced in Cologne, {{but also for the}} import of goods from other provinces. Late Antiquity bases included Mainz / Straubing, Speyer and Passau. After the Battle of Mursa Major in 351 AD the naval port in Mainz was expanded and became a major base for the <b>Rhine</b> <b>fleet.</b> The naval base in Mainz was used mainly {{in the second half of}} the 3rd and the 4th century. The newly organized <b>Rhine</b> <b>fleet</b> in the first third of the 4th century was their primary source of power the central portion of the RHine was occupied periodically with castles as supply bases and safe havens. Without this support, an effective use of the <b>Rhine</b> <b>fleet</b> would have been impossible. It is believed that the late antiquity (left bank) fortifications between Bingen and Bonn were built during the reign of Constantine I's sons (ca. 320-350) according to a uniform plan.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the fact}} that in 1981/82 during {{construction}} works near the Rhine river well-preserved remains of several ships from Late Antiquity, the so said Mainzer Roman ships were discovered, an adequate exhibition space for these was required. There were discovered two different types of warship of late Roman <b>Rhine</b> <b>fleet</b> ″Classis Germanica″ and other ship types.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Rhine</b> <b>fleet</b> {{was formed}} in 13 BC. Since the fleet was {{concentrated}} on the Rhine, the fleet {{was involved in the}} campaigns of the Roman army. The objective of the fleet changed in 17 AD when Emperor Tiberius planned the invasion of the tribes east of the Rhine. As a result, the fleet was no longer just responsible for guarding the Rhine, but also supporting offensives.|$|E
50|$|In late 286 {{or early}} 287 {{he learned of}} this {{sentence}} and responded by usurping power and declaring himself emperor of Britannia and northern Gaul. When the British fleet was attacked by a <b>Rhine</b> <b>fleet</b> representing the Roman Empire, the British fleet was victorious, showing {{that it must have}} been substantial at the time. The would-be invaders, however, blamed poor weather for their defeat.|$|E
50|$|Even more {{important}} than its use in military campaigns was the logistical role of the <b>Rhine</b> <b>fleet</b> ever since the period of Drusus's Germania offensives. From Vetera (Modern day Xanten) the forts were supplied. The docks were often fortified. The fleet was also used for civil transport, for example moving stones {{were obtained from the}} quarries of Brohltal in Siebengebirge. Even foods like corn and wine, which could be moved only with difficulty by land, were transported.|$|E
50|$|In 28 AD the Frisii {{rebelled against}} Roman rule. The <b>Rhine</b> <b>fleet</b> brought an expeditionary {{force in the}} revolting area, {{including}} to the besieged Roman port facility Flevum (Velsen). However, the frisii could not be stopped. The Romans {{lost control of the}} North Sea coast to the mouth of the Rhine. Between 46 AD and 47 AD the Romans tried to subdue the Frisians but despite the use of the fleet, the Romans could not maintain their gains.|$|E
50|$|In Augustan {{times larger}} offensives {{were set in}} motion by the Romans. There were several {{large-scale}} landing operations of Roman troops from the North Sea, which were closely coordinated with land forces. In 12 BC, Drusus led the <b>Rhine</b> <b>fleet</b> through the canals of the Zuiderzee in the North Sea (fossa Drusiana). As the Frisii and Chauci had only primitive canoes, sail unhindered with his vastly superior forces into the mouth of the Weser (Visurgis) and forced both tribes into submission.|$|E
50|$|Little {{is known}} about the chain of command of the <b>Rhine</b> <b>fleet.</b> The {{commander}} was a praefectus classis from the equestrian order, a procuratores centenarii, which meant he earned 100,000 sesterces a year. Below the prefect rank was the praepositus classis, each fleet usually having two of them. The future Emperor Pertinax served in the Classis Germanica as prefect. The officers each had their own staff and aides. In the 3rd century the rank of fleet tribunes was created (tribunus classis) who took over the duties of the first Nauarchs. Later he was called also tribunus liburnarum (tribune of warships).|$|E
5000|$|In {{the time}} of Valentinian I, effort was put into making the fleet {{operational}} again. Around that {{time there was a}} new frontier defense concept that was based on the <b>Rhine</b> <b>fleet</b> and a string of left-bank bases and a large number of heavily fortified border forts. Warships patrolled from here almost constantly on the Rhine. Ports and forts in Speyer, Worms and Altrip built and the right bank borders Burgi in , [...] and Ladenburg were built. There were repeated clashes with Germanic invaders, as some dedicatory inscriptions of the Rhine frontier testify. After the invasion of the Vandals, Suebi and Alans on New Years Eve in 407, the fleet disbanded permanently.|$|E
50|$|The fleet was {{assembled}} in 13 BC, and {{was responsible for}} monitoring the entire Rhine from {{the confluence of the}} Vinxtbach and its navigable tributaries as well as the Zuiderzee and North Sea coastlines in the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta area. Later on, the estuaries on the right bank of the Rhine were also included in its charter in order to maintain a smooth flow of transportation and commerce on the river. The allegiance of the Classis Germanica to the Army of Germania Inferior (Exercitus Germaniae Inferioris) was confirmed by a Roman military diploma (located in the Netherlands) during Trajan's reign. Besides specifying the local auxiliary troops involved, it also lists the <b>Rhine</b> <b>fleet,</b> that likely was still in existence (in altered form) until the 4th century.|$|E
50|$|During the Batavian {{rebellion}} of Gaius Julius Civilis (69-70), {{the rebels}} {{got hold of}} a squadron of the <b>Rhine</b> <b>fleet</b> by treachery, and the conflict featured frequent use of the Roman Rhine flotilla.

5000|$|With the {{founding}} of the province of Germania Inferior under Domitian in AD 89, the commander of the Legions of Lower Germania Colonia became the provincial governor, based in Colonia. In AD 80 a water supply was built, the Eifel Aqueduct, one of the longest aqueducts of the Roman Empire, which delivered 20,000 cubic metres of water to the city every day. Ten years later, the colonia became the capital of the Roman province of Lower Germany, Germania Inferior, with a total population of 20,000 people. The <b>Rhine</b> <b>fleet</b> was stationed south of the city at Alteburg. The fortress itself was destroyed in attacks by the Franks in AD 276. This area was later named Alte Burg, from which come the present day names [...] "Alteburger Wall" [...] and [...] "Alteburger Platz".|$|E
5000|$|The {{most notable}} was in 209 when the emperor Septimius Severus, {{claiming}} to be provoked by the belligerence of the Maeatae tribe, campaigned against the Caledonian Confederacy, a coalition of Brittonic Pictish tribes of the north of Britain. He used the three legions of the British garrison (augmented by the recently formed 2nd Parthica legion), 9000 imperial guards with cavalry support, and numerous auxiliaries supplied from the sea by the British fleet, the <b>Rhine</b> <b>fleet</b> and two fleets transferred from the Danube for the purpose. According to Dio Cassius, he inflicted genocidal depredations on the natives and incurred the loss of 50,000 of his own men to the attrition of guerrilla tactics before having to withdraw to Hadrian's Wall. He repaired and reinforced the wall {{with a degree of}} thoroughness that led most subsequent Roman authors to attribute the construction of the wall to him. It was during the negotiations to purchase the truce necessary to secure the Roman retreat to the wall that the first recorded utterance, attributable with any reasonable degree of confidence, to a native of Scotland was made (as recorded by Dio Cassius). When Septimius Severus's wife, Julia Domna, criticised the sexual morals of the Caledonian women, the wife of a Caledonian chief, Argentocoxos, replied: [...] "We consort openly with the best of men while you allow yourselves to be debauched in private by the worst". The emperor Septimius Severus died at York while planning to renew hostilities, and these plans were abandoned by his son Caracalla.|$|E
