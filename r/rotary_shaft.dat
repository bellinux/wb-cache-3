40|$|Radial {{vibration}} measurement of <b>rotary</b> <b>shafts</b> plays {{a significant part}} in condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. This paper presents a novel method for radial {{vibration measurement}} through electrostatic sensing and HHT (Hilbert-Huang Transform) signal processing. The foundational characteristics of the electrostatic sensor {{in the vicinity of}} a drifting shaft are studied through Finite Element Modelling. Experimental tests were conducted on a purpose-built test rig to characterize the operating condition of the rotor at different rotational speeds (400 rpm and 600 rpm). A normal working shaft and an eccentric shaft were tested and the output signals from the electrostatic sensors were analyzed. Through empirical mode decomposition (EMD) on the electrostatic signals, the intrinsic mode functions (IMF) including the vibration information of the shaft are identified and further analyzed in the time-frequency domain. Experimental results suggest that the electrostatic sensing technique in conjunction with HHT provides a simple and cost-effective approach to radial vibration measurement of <b>rotary</b> <b>shafts...</b>|$|R

40|$|The use of <b>rotary</b> <b>shaft</b> seals made of PTFE {{material}} is ever increasing in the sealing of moving machine elements {{as a consequence}} of their high thermal and chemical resistance. Primarily in the sector of pressure-loadable <b>rotary</b> <b>shaft</b> seals, there is a high development demand. High circumferential velocity and high pressure of the liquid to be sealed make the use of elastomer seals impossible. A promising alternative is presented by PTFE <b>rotary</b> <b>shaft</b> seals. The relieved <b>rotary</b> <b>shaft</b> lip seal represents a special design among PTFE <b>rotary</b> <b>shaft</b> seals. Not relying on thermal resistance of the PTFE material alone, the relieved <b>rotary</b> <b>shaft</b> seal as far as possible reduces the heat generating frictional moment for the permissible pressure range of the liquid to be sealed. Besides a high relative velocity at the sealing edge, thus, at the same time, high pressure of the liquid to be sealed is possible. Within the scope of this report, a contribution was made to the optimization of the relieved <b>rotary</b> <b>shaft</b> seal. Earlier designs of the relieved <b>rotary</b> <b>shaft</b> seal, similar to other commercially available <b>rotary</b> <b>shaft</b> seals, sometimes exhibited temporary surge-like leakages, the cause of which is the thermal expansion of the PTFE material. This was remedied by a functional analysis of the sealing system, experimental investigations, and by the use of FE simulations. In this way, the plastic memory effect, the temperature-dependent re-deformation capability of pre-deformed workpieces, proved to be a helpful measure against thermal expansion. (orig.

5000|$|Galvanometers (also called [...] "scanners" [...] or [...] "galvos")are {{computer-controlled}} electromagnetic {{devices that}} move mirrors {{mounted on the}} end of <b>rotary</b> <b>shafts.</b> The mirror reflects the laser beam to [...] "draw" [...] images. Galvanometers are typically identified by their speed of operation, measured in Kpps (kilo points per second). Available speeds include 8k, 12k, 20k, 30k, 35k, 50k, and 60k. The faster the galvanometers, the smoother and more flicker-free the projected image. Each galvanometer moves the beam in one plane, either X axis or Y axis. Placing the galvanometers close together at 90 degrees to each other allows full movement of the laser beam within a defined square area. The most useful specifications of a galvanometer pair for laser show use are the speed at which they can draw points, and the angle at which they achieve this speed. Galvanometers come in two main groups: open loop and closed loop. Closed loop, which is most common, means the galvanometer is controlled by a servo system—the control circuit uses a feedback signal generated by the mirror's motion to correct motion commands. An amplifier similar to an audio power amplifier drives the mirror.|$|R

With its 72 in diameter coupled wheels, it {{was considered to be}} the most remarkable Cape gauge express passenger locomotive ever built. The coupled wheels were the largest ever used on any less than [...] locomotive, and it had an all-up weight and tractive effort equal to or exceeding that of most Pacifics outside North America. It used rotary cam poppet valve gear driven by outside <b>rotary</b> <b>shafts,</b> which resulted in extremely free-running characteristics. It also boasted the largest fire grate on any Pacific outside North America. The Class 16E had a Watson Standard no. 3A boiler and, at 9 ft above rail level, its boiler centre-line was the highest-pitched on the SAR. This and the limitations of the loading gauge made it impossible to install a normal steam dome and its place was taken by an inspection man-hole. Steam was collected through numerous small feeder pipes fixed into two collector pipes, which were arranged as high as possible above the water surface. The collector pipes joined together to form a main steam pipe, 7 in in diameter, which led to the superheater header and multiple valve regulator, situated in the smokebox.|$|R
