40|$|This {{study used}} {{generalizability}} theory to measure reliability on the Recognizing Effective Special Education Teachers (RESET) observation tool designed to evaluate {{special education teacher}} effectiveness. At {{the time of this}} study, the <b>RESET</b> <b>tool</b> included three evidence-based instructional practices (direct, explicit instruction; whole-group instruction; and discrete trial teaching) as the basis for special education teacher evaluation. Five raters participated in two sessions to evaluate special education classroom instruction collected from two school years, via the Teachscape 360 -degree video system. Data collected from raters were analyzed in a two-facet “partially” nested design where occasions (o) were nested within teachers (t), o:t, and crossed with raters (r), {o:t} x r. Results from this study are in alignment with similar studies that found multiple observations and multiple raters are critical for ensuring acceptable levels of measurement score reliability. Considerations for the feasibility of practice should be observed in future reliability and validity studies on the <b>RESET</b> <b>tool,</b> and further work is needed to address the lack of research on rater reliability issues within special education teacher evaluation...|$|E
40|$|This {{study used}} {{generalizability}} theory to identify sources of variance on a pilot observation tool designed to evaluate {{special education teacher}} effectiveness, and was guided by the question: How many occasions and raters are needed for acceptable levels of reliability when using the pilot RESET observation tool to evaluate special education teachers? At {{the time of this}} study, the pilot Recognizing Effective Special Education Teachers (RESET) observation tool included three evidence-based instructional practices (direct, explicit instruction, whole-group instruction, and discrete trial teaching) as the basis for special education teacher evaluation. Eight teachers (raters) were invited to attend two sessions (October 2012 and April 2013) to evaluate special education classroom instruction collected from the 2011 - 2012 and 2012 - 2013 school years, via the Teachscape 360 -degree video system. The raters were trained on the pilot RESET observation tool, and participated in whole-group coding sessions to establish interrater agreement (minimum of 80 %) before evaluating assigned videos. Data collected from raters were analyzed in a two-facet “partially” nested design where occasions (o) (observations/lessons) were nested within teachers (t), o:t, and crossed with raters (r), {o:t} x r. Using the results from the generalizability study analyses, decision studies were then completed to determine optimal facet conditions for the highest levels of reliability (the relative G coefficient and standard error of measurement scores were used to inform the decision study analyses). Results from this study are in alignment with similar studies that found multiple observations and multiple raters are critical for ensuring acceptable levels of reliability. Recommendations for future studies include investigating the use of different raters (e. g., principals, university faculty, etc.), and using larger facet sample sizes to increase the overall measurement precision of the <b>RESET</b> <b>tool.</b> Considerations for the feasibility of practice must also be observed in future reliability and validity studies on the <b>RESET</b> <b>tool...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{study used}} Kane’s (2013) Interpretation/Use Argument (IUA) to measure {{validity}} on the Recognizing Effective Special Education Teachers (<b>RESET)</b> observation <b>tool.</b> The <b>RESET</b> observation <b>tool</b> {{is designed to}} evaluate special education teacher effectiveness using evidence-based instructional practices {{as the basis for}} evaluation. In alignment with other studies (Bell et al., 2012), we applied and interpreted Kane’s (2006) four inferences for trait observation: scoring, generalization, extrapolation, and decision rules. Results from this study show that acceptable levels of validity are promising for the <b>RESET</b> observation <b>tool.</b> Because the <b>RESET</b> observation <b>tool</b> is premised on the idea that by increasing the use of evidence-based practices, student achievement will also increase, further investigations into the relationship between fidelity of implementation of instruction and student achievement will be critical for moving project work forward...|$|R

40|$|There is {{currently}} little consensus on how {{special education teachers}} should be evaluated. The lack of consensus {{may be due to}} several reasons. Special education teachers work under a variety of complex conditions, with a very heterogeneous population, and support student progress toward a very individualized set of goals. In addition, special education is marked by historical rates of attrition, with a lack of highly qualified teachers entering the field, and a number of special education teachers completing alternate certification programs, leading to a combined effect that impacts overall professional quality. In this article, we first review the challenges associated with evaluating special education teachers, describe and analyze current approaches, and present a conceptual framework for an approach to special education teacher evaluation. We then provide an overview of the Recognizing Effective Special Education Teachers (<b>RESET)</b> <b>tool</b> as a possible alternative to measure special education teacher effectiveness. Given the current zeitgeist of teacher evaluation systems that fail to address the unique circumstances related to special education teachers, it is hoped that the information in this article will contribute to the small but growing body of research on special education teacher evaluation and effectiveness...|$|E
40|$|There {{is now a}} {{considerable}} body of evidence revealing {{that a number of}} ethnic minority groups in the UK and other economically developed countries experience disproportionate levels of morbidity and mortality compared with the majority white European-origin population. Across these countries, health-promoting approaches are increasingly viewed as the long-term strategies most likely to prove clinically effective and cost-effective for preventing disease and improving health outcomes in those with established disease. To identify, appraise and interpret research on the approaches employed to maximise the cross-cultural appropriateness and effectiveness of health promotion interventions for smoking cessation, increasing physical activity and improving healthy eating for African-, Chinese- and South Asian-origin populations. Two national conferences; seven databases of UK guidelines and international systematic reviews of health promotion interventions aimed at the general population, including the Clinical Evidence, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network databases (1950 - 2009); 11 databases of research on adapted health promotion interventions for ethnic minority populations, including BIOSIS, EMBASE and MEDLINE (1950 - 2009); and in-depth qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of researchers and health promoters. Theoretically based, mixed-methods, phased programme of research that involved user engagement, systematic reviews and qualitative interviews, which were integrated through a realist synthesis. Following a launch conference, two reviewers independently identified and extracted data from guidelines and systematic reviews on the effectiveness of interventions for the general population and any guidance offered in relation to how to interpret this evidence for ethnic minority populations. Data were thematically analysed. Reviewers then independently identified and critically appraised studies of adapted interventions and summarised data to assess feasibility, acceptability, equity, clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Interviews were transcribed, coded and thematically analysed. The quantitative and qualitative data were then synthesised using a realist framework to understand better how adapted interventions work and to assess implementation considerations and prioritise future research. Our preliminary findings were refined through discussion and debate at an end-of-study national user engagement conference. Initial user engagement emphasised the importance of extending this work beyond individual-centred behavioural interventions to also include examination of community- and ecological-level interventions; however, individual-centred behavioural approaches dominated the 15 relevant guidelines and 111 systematic reviews we identified. The most consistent evidence of effectiveness was for pharmacological interventions for smoking cessation. This body of work, however, provided scant evidence on the effectiveness of these interventions for ethnic minority groups. We identified 173 reports of adapted health promotion interventions, the majority of which focused on US-based African Americans. This body of evidence was used to develop a 46 -item Typology of Adaptation and a Programme Theory of Adapted Health Promotion Interventions. Only nine empirical studies directly compared the effectiveness of culturally adapted interventions with standard health promotion interventions, these failing to yield any consistent evidence; no studies reported on cost-effectiveness. The 26 qualitative interviews highlighted the need to extend thinking on ethnicity from conventional dimensions to more contextual considerations. The realist synthesis enabled the production of a decision-making tool (RESET) to support future research. The lack of robust evidence of effectiveness for physical activity and healthy-eating interventions in the general population identified at the outset limited the comparative synthesis work we could undertake in the latter phases. Furthermore, the majority of studies undertaking an adapted intervention were conducted within African American populations; this raises important questions about the generalisability of findings to, for example, a UK context and other ethnic minority groups. Lastly, given our focus on three health areas and three populations, we have inevitably excluded many studies of adapted interventions for other health topics and other ethnic minority populations. There is currently a lack of evidence on how best to deliver smoking cessation, physical activity and healthy eating-related health promotion interventions to ethnic minority populations. Although culturally adapting interventions can increase salience, acceptability and uptake, there is as yet insufficient evidence on the clinical effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of these adapted approaches. More head-to-head comparisons of adapted compared with standard interventions are warranted. The Typology of Adaptation, Programme Theory of Adapted Health Promotion Interventions and <b>RESET</b> <b>tool</b> should help researchers to develop more considered approaches to adapting interventions than has hitherto been the case.

Reset control systems are essentially linear control systems that reset certain controller states to zero according to a <b>reset</b> rule. The <b>tool</b> has been developed using Sysquake, a Matlab-like language with fast execution and excellent facilities for interactive graphics, and is delivered as a stand-alone executable that is readily accessible to students and users. The highly visual and strongly coupled nature of reset control system is very amenable to interactive tools, and the tool {{presented in this paper}} enables to discover a myriad of important properties of these systems.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of interrater {{agreement}} analyses on a pilot special education teacher evaluation instrument, the Recognizing Effective Special Education Teachers (<b>RESET)</b> Observation <b>Tool</b> (OT). Using evidence-based instructional practices {{as the basis for}} the evaluation, the RESET OT is designed for the spectrum of different instructional needs found within special education classrooms. The RESET OT informs what Danielson (2011) maintains are the two features of a teacher evaluation system 1) ensuring teacher quality and 2) promoting professional development. In June 2012, six special education teachers participated in a data coding session using the pilot RESET OT to evaluate video observations of special education instructional practice from the 2011 - 2012 school year. The teacher coders received an introductory training session to the RESET OT, and participated in two whole-group coding sessions before completing individual coding assignments. The results of the interrater agreement analysis report weak to no agreement within specific instructional practices, indicating the need for 1) additional research and development on the RESET OT 2) repeating the data coding session using a group of teacher coders who have received in-depth training on the RESET OT and evidence-based instructional practices, and 3) further investigation into the specific components of evidence based instructional practice and how these might be applied across settings...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Generally, the NC {{format is}} the {{description}} for the positioning and/or {{the movement of}} its linear and rotary axes. As the multi-axis machine tools {{have a variety of}} configurations, their NC codes are not exchangeable. This issue leads to some inconvenience and confounding in the manufacturing processing schedule. Furthermore, when the specifications of tool such as length, diameter or shape are reset, the NC program must be regenerated accordingly. That is to say, the exchangeability of NC program among different five-axis machine configurations is an important issue in making better usage of industrial five-axis machine tools for efficient applications. An APT program records the tool path, tool vector and cutting information, etc. In particular, the recent development of APT format can provide the capability recording the motion posture of the tool such as the tool orientation, the position and its normal vector of the tool contact point. Therefore, it can solve the problems of the exchangeability for the different machine tools as well as the online <b>resetting</b> of <b>tool</b> specifications, even the tool posture. In this paper, a new method was proposed to interpret the APT code into tool movement data including toolpath, location, tool orientation, the contact point and its contact vector, etc., which {{can be applied to the}} conversion of different NC codes, or be connected to the controller of the machin...|$|R
