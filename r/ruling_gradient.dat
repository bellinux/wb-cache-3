25|$|By 1923, the A2 class 4-6-0 locomotives, which dated back to 1907, were {{frequently}} double-heading on interstate expresses to Serviceton and Albury as increasing traffic saw loads exceed the eight car maximum {{of a single}} A2 on these services. The Victorian Railways Commissioners recommended considerably more powerful locomotives to haul trains of up to eleven cars unassisted over the ruling gradients on these lines. The S class 4-6-2 Pacifics displaced the A2s from North East line express services from 1928 onwards and allowed a faster timetable to be introduced. However a Pacific-type locomotive was not particularly well suited to the Western line. The section between Melbourne and Ballarat had sharply curved, steep inclines, the most notorious {{of which was the}} , 1 in 48 (2.08&) <b>ruling</b> <b>gradient</b> of the Ingliston Bank. As early as 1923 VR locomotive designers were considering 4-8-2 Mountain-type locomotives for this purpose, along {{with the use of a}} third cylinder to allow increased power to be achieved without breaching the loading gauge.|$|E

Falahill is the tenth highest standard gauge railway summit in Britain, just [...] lower than Shap summit. The Fushiebridge loop is on a 1 in 70 gradient and climbs southwards up the Borthwick Bank which had posed a challenge {{in the past for}} steam locomotives pulling heavy loads.|$|E

Many of the bridges are multi-arched, {{reminiscent}} of Ancient Roman aqueducts, while one bridge, which spans , {{is made with}} plate girders and steel truss. The <b>ruling</b> <b>gradient</b> of the railway is 1:33 or 3%, and it features 919 curves, with the sharpest at 48 degrees (a radius of [...] ). The tracks climb from [...] to a peak elevation of [...] at Shimla. The longest tunnel on the line is the Barog Tunnel (No. 33) which is [...] long, connecting Dagshai and Solan. The loops at Taksal, Gumman, and Dharampur help to attain flatter gradients.|$|E
50|$|A {{couple of}} the second batch of {{locomotives}} joined the first one on the South Coast line for a brief period, but most {{went directly to the}} Eastern Cape where they were used on the Port Alfred branch and the Aliwal North to Barkly East line, famous for its reverses and its 1 in 30 (3⅓%) compensated <b>ruling</b> <b>gradients.</b> The Natal locomotives were soon also relocated to work there when the Class GC Garratts replaced them on the South Coast line later in 1924. They remained working on the Barkly East branch until they were withdrawn from service in 1967.|$|R
50|$|The {{next six}} {{locomotives}} which were ordered from Falcon in 1896, were of an altered design. The Falcon F4 was larger and {{heavier than the}} F2, with the running boards stepped down below the cab, a larger tube heating surface in the boiler, single slidebars, straight lipped funnels, Ramsbottom safety valves over the fireboxes, and a tractive effort which was increased from the 3000 lbf kN at 75% of boiler pressure of the F2 to 3987 lbf kN. They were numbered {{in the range from}} BR10 to BR15 and could pull 180 lt t up the <b>ruling</b> <b>gradients,</b> compared to the 160 lt t which the F2 could manage.|$|R
50|$|The {{lines were}} undulating with <b>ruling</b> <b>gradients</b> of about 1 in 80 and lengthy climbs {{averaging}} 1 in 100. There {{was a significant}} summit at Tiffield between Blisworth and Towcester; again approaching Morton Pinkney, near Byfield and near Fenny Compton; and at Ettington Lime Works, a mile west of Ettington station. he line to Ravenstone Wood Junction was also undulating at 1 in 100 with a mile of 1 in 82, and the Midland Railway section onward to Olney fell at 1 in 75 and 1 in 70 for four miles. The Cockley Brake line climbed continuously to a summit a mile east of Cockley Brake, the final ascent being over a mile of 1 in 65, followed by a fall of over a mile at 1 in 70.|$|R
500|$|A unique {{feature of}} the line is its {{horseshoe}} embankments. Notable features of the route include Neral Station, the first on the route; the Herdal Hill section; the steep grade of Bhekra Khud; the One Kiss Tunnel (the only tunnel on the route, it earned its nickname because the tunnel is {{just long enough to}} exchange a kiss with one's partner); a water pipe station, which is no longer in operation; [...] Mountain Berry, which features two sharp zig zags; Panorama Point; and finally, the end of the route at Matheran Bazaar. The broad-gauge railroad between Mumbai and Pune runs near the Matheran Hill Railway, and the two tracks cross each other at two locations.

2500|$|The lines {{approaching}} the first cascade tunnel had a <b>ruling</b> <b>gradient</b> of 2.2% (1 in 45.5), while the tunnel itself had a gradient of 1.7% (1 in 58.8) facing eastbound trains. This gradient {{appears to be}} chosen by the expedient of building the shortest possible tunnel that connected with the original switchback route connecting Tye (Wellington) (West) at 955m and Cascade Tunnel Station (East) at 1031m. The higher portal of the [...] long tunnel was [...] higher than the lower portal. Even though the <b>ruling</b> <b>gradient</b> in the tunnel was (slightly) less than that on the tracks on either side, the first Cascade tunnel soon proved to have problems with fumes, which were later resolved by electrification.|$|E
2500|$|The {{line was}} {{engineered}} to very high standards: a <b>ruling</b> <b>gradient</b> of 1 in 176 ( [...] ‰) (exceeded {{in only a}} few locations on the London extension) was employed; curves of a minimum radius of [...] (except in city areas) were used; and there was only one level crossing between Sheffield Victoria and London Marylebone (at , still in use).|$|E
5000|$|The railway {{was built}} by the Stirland family and first opened as a tourist {{attraction}} in August 1990. At this time the railway ran in a circuit from the main station at Exmoor Central, trains descending on a large embankment before climbing back up through a spiral and tunnel. In 1996 a new station was opened at Cape of Good Hope, which changed the line to an [...] "end-to-end" [...] layout. At {{the end of the}} 2001 season, the decision was taken to close the railway to the public and concentrate on building new steam locomotives and associated equipment. The railway remains in full working order, and work started in the winter 2008/9 on extending the railway. By mid-2010 an additional half a mile of track had been brought into use, with a very steep ascending and descending <b>ruling</b> <b>gradients</b> of 1 in 28.|$|R
5000|$|The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway was {{the first}} to use the configuration. In 1911, their own {{workshop}} took a pair of standard 2-8-0 and combined them into a 2-8-8-0 [...] "Consolidation Mallet" [...] articulated locomotive. Four examples were built, but were never entirely satisfactory and were converted back to 2-8-0 in 1923. The first 2-8-8-0 operated by Baltimore and Ohio was numbered EL-1/a, which was built in 1916 at Baldwin Locomotive Works. The western end of their network had <b>ruling</b> <b>gradients</b> greater than 2%, and the 2-8-8-0 offered exceptional tractive effort, enabling a single locomotive to move the heaviest freight trains. As well as building these locomotives from scratch, the last in 1920, ten were converted from 0-8-8-0 configuration in 1920 and a further ten from 2-8-8-2 in 1922. These locomotives remained in operation until after World War II, the last being withdrawn in 1955. None have been preserved. 1 Tender from the 2-8-8-0 #759 of the Kansas City Southern Railroad has Preserved, The Locomotive was Scrapped and the Tender was Only Preserved, it is Now Preserved in Union IL at the Illinois Railway Museum.|$|R

40|$|In {{speaking}} of narrow gauge railways in Tasmania, we must accept {{the term in}} its comparative sense. It is a general practice to describe all railways of a less width than 4 ft. 8 |in. as narrow gauge. Indeed, not many years since the term "narrow gauge" {{was applied to the}} 4 ft. 8 1 / 2 in. guage, which is now called the standard gauge of England. The Tasmanian Railways, being of a gauge of 3 ft. 6 in., should properly be described as a narrow gauge system. What we have attempted to do on the West Coast is to construct a narrower gauge, viz., a 2 ft. line, as being more suitable to local and financial conditions. Although oar 2 ft. gauge line on the West Coast marks a new era in Government railway construction in Australasia, it must not be regarded in the light of an experiment. The oldest 2 ft. gauge line, as far as I am aware, is the Festiniog line in Wales. To be accurate, the width of this line is 1 ft. 11 1 / 2 in. The Festiniog Railway Company was originally incorporated in 1832, and commenced work as a tramway from Port Madoek to certain slate quarries near Festiniog. In 1869 the Company was re-incorporated and the present line constructed at a cost of ^£ 10, 727 per mile. The <b>ruling</b> <b>gradients</b> are comparatively easy as compared with our Tasmanian grades, viz., 1 in 80. The line is worked with double Fairlie engines, weighing 24 tons, and the Company pays rather better than 5 per cent, on its capital. The paper was illustrated with lantern slides of a number of exquisite photographic views of the new railway, and of the West Coast generally, taken quite recently by Mr. J. W. Beattie, which gave the spectator a good idea of the kind of country the line traversed. Frederick Back was General Manager of the Tasmanian Government Railways from August 1885 - 190...|$|R
2500|$|With the {{completion}} of the line south of Wanganui, attention was focused on the line to the north. [...] The section from Aramoho to Kai Iwi, including the Westmere Bank, opened on 28 June 1879. [...] The Westmere Bank's grade is 1 in 35 (with a peak grade of 1 in 28) and it remains the line's <b>ruling</b> <b>gradient.</b> [...] From Kai Iwi, Waitotara was reached on 20 September 1880, Waverley on 23 March 1881, and Manutahi via Patea on 28 August 1883. [...] From this point, construction proceeded to complete the small gap between the southern and northern sections.|$|E
2500|$|This {{involved}} {{creating a}} new junction at Bleach Green where the Larne and Loop Lines diverged. The former main line from Greenisland Junction was singled and joined the new Main Line at a new connection, Mossley Junction, {{to the east of}} Mossley station. The old main line became known as the [...] "Back Line". The <b>ruling</b> <b>gradient</b> on the Loop Line was 1 in 75 which could only be achieved by excavating and lowering a section of the existing Main Line near Mossley station. The new lines were carried over Valentine's Glen on imposing ferro-concrete viaducts. The smaller of these curved to the east from Bleach Green Junction as a burrowing junction passing under a skew span of the larger Main Line viaduct which curved westwards. The old masonry Main Line viaduct was retained to carry what had become the up Larne Line.|$|E
2500|$|The Jaffa–Jerusalem railway, {{funded by}} Chemin de Fer Ottoman de Jaffa à Jérusalem et Prolongements, {{was the first}} railway {{to be built in}} Palestine.

The eastern part of the line, in the Judean hills between Dayr Aban and Jerusalem, is {{particularly}} steep and winding. The [...] "J"'s first locomotives were a fleet of five 2-6-0 Mogul tender locomotives from Baldwin in the USA, delivered in 1890 and 1892. On a number of occasions the Baldwins' six-coupled driving wheels either spread the rails or became derailed on tight curves. As traffic increased the J obtained four 0-4-4-0 Mallet articulated locomotives from Borsig in Germany, delivered between 1904 and 1914. The Mallets were intended to deliver greater tractive effort without spreading the rails, but they too suffered a number of derailments.|$|E
2500|$|The {{criticism}} of the difficult Turakina route south from Wanganui voiced {{at the opening of}} the line progressively increased over the years. [...] By the mid-1930s it had become a severe bottleneck and the Railways Department decided to construct a deviation. [...] In 1937 construction began on a new 16-km route to replace 23km of the original route. [...] It included significant tunnelling work and had a <b>ruling</b> <b>gradient</b> of 1 in 70 rather than 1 in 35. [...] Due to the project's importance, work continued throughout World War II, with only a brief pause in 1942 at the height of fears of a Japanese invasion. [...] Defects with the tunnels caused delays in completion, and the deviation opened on 7 December 1947. [...] On the old route, AB class steam locomotives were capable of hauling 175 tons; on the new deviation they could handle up to 420 tons. [...] The formation of the old route remains for much of its length, and is used as O'Leary Road near Fordell; a couple of platform edges at old station sites also remain.|$|E
2500|$|The 9F {{also proved}} its worth as a {{passenger}} locomotive, adept at fast running despite its small driving wheels, {{and for a}} time was a frequent sight on the Somerset and Dorset Railway, where its power and high proportion of adhesive weight were well suited to coping with the 1 in 50 <b>ruling</b> <b>gradient</b> on the Bath extension. On one occasion, a 9F was set to haul an express passenger train, in place of the normal LNER [...] "Pacific", from Grantham to King's Cross.

The driver was afterwards told that he was only supposed to keep time, [...] "not break the bloody sound barrier!" [...] He replied that the engine had no speedometer, and that it ran so smoothly at high speeds that he just let it run as fast as felt safe. Nor was this the only instance of 9Fs reaching high speeds.

Although the tunnel scheme was not realised by this railway company, the route operated services between [...] and [...] via , with the dedicated express track beginning at [...] in Nottinghamshire.

The GCR's target market was higher-class 'business' travellers, and it promoted its long-distance express trains with the slogan [...] "Rapid Travel in Luxury". Most of the Great Central Main Line closed in 1966 as part of the Beeching cuts, although parts of the route are still in use today by Chiltern Railways as the London to Aylesbury Line.
