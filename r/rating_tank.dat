Table 1 - 1 lists 18 SSTs covered by this NOC. This NOC also addresses other activities that are performed in support of salt well pumping but do not require the application of a portable exhauster. Specifically this NOC analyzes the following three activities that have the potential for emissions. (1) Salt well pumping (i. e., the actual transferring of waste from one tank to another) under nominal tank operating conditions. Nominal tank operating conditions include existing passive breathing rates. (2) Salt well pumping (the actual transferring of waste from one tank to another) with use of a portable exhauster. (3) Use of a water lance on the waste to facilitate salt well screen and salt well jet pump installation into the waste. This activity is to be performed under nominal (existing passive breathing <b>rates)</b> <b>tank</b> operating conditions. The use of portable exhausters represents a cost savings because one portable exhauster can be moved back and forth between SSTs as schedules for salt well pumping dictate.

Model predictions were validated in a depuration experiment with geosmin-loaded European eel (n = 95) with a mean (SD) individual weight of 134. 4 (5. 0) g and a mean (SD) lipid content of 33. 7 (2. 8) % (w/w). Fish were depurated for 24, 48 or 72 h at three different <b>tank</b> water renewal <b>rates</b> (0. 3, 3. 3 and 33 day- 1). Treatments were installed by three different mean (SD) water flow rates (13. 8 (1. 3), 143. 5 (9. 2) and 1511 (80) L kg fish- 1 day- 1) over 30 -L tanks. Eels eliminated geosmin from their bodies, but unlike the model predicted, this was independent of the water renewal rate of the depuration tanks. Although being eliminated from the fish, geosmin hardly appeared and certainly did not accumulate in {{the water of the}} depuration tanks as the model predicted. This observation may be explained by geosmin being eliminated from eel as metabolite rather than the parent compound. Geosmin elimination from eel seems not to occur according to the generally accepted passive diffusion mechanism for excretion of lipophilic chemicals, and geosmin biotransformation by the eel seems indicated. Clearly geosmin depuration from European eel cannot be enhanced by increasing water renewal <b>rates</b> of depuration <b>tanks...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} master {{thesis is}} to analyse and develop design methods for {{building}} integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPV/T) technology at the Green Energy Laboratory (GEL) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in China. PV/T technology generates electrical and thermal energy in a smaller area, compared to solely PV panels and solar collectors. For a PV panel, the electrical efficiency will decrease when the surface temperature increases, typically during peak solar irradiation. The air or water circulating in the PV/T component cools the PV surface, maintaining higher efficiency and thus higher energy generation. A water based PV/T component has been calibrated and validated according to measurements conducted in Shanghai, China. Furthermore, the component was used to model a PV/T façade at the south wall of GEL. A façade integrated PV/T system utilising air as heat transfer medium was also modelled, but not validated, as no measurements were available for this component. The BIPV/T systems were optimised for five parameters; dead band, storage tank size, mass flow <b>rate,</b> <b>tank</b> inlet height from heat source and tank inlet height from mains water supply. Simulations have been conducted to analyse the effect of building integration, both on the building energy demand and the BIPV/T system operation. Simulations were carried out for the same building model with air based BIPV/T system, water based BIPV/T system, air based PV/T system, water based PV/T system and PV façade (BIPV). The results show that PV/T integrated to the building façade has negligible effect on the total energy demand of the building. The electrical efficiency was highest for the air based BIPV/T system and the water based BIPV/T showed the largest amount of collected thermal useful energy. The BIPV showed the highest electrical solar fraction, as {{a significant amount of}} fan energy required for operation of the air based BIPV/T system results in reduced solar fraction for that system...|$|R
