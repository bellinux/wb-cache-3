Direct negotiation is the third typology emerging from her identity as a professional service provider that a live -out cleaner has established.

Methods 58 billing office workers completed surveys including health information and four productivity loss questionnaires. Employer productivity metrics and work hours were also obtained. ResultsProductivity loss questionnaires were weakly to moderately correlated with employer productivity metrics. Workers with more health complaints reported greater health-related productivity loss than healthier workers, but showed no loss on employer productivity metrics. Economic estimates of productivity loss showed wide variation among questionnaires, yet no loss of actual productivity. ConclusionsAdditional studies are needed comparing questionnaires with objective measures in larger samples and other industries, to improve measurement methods for health-related productivity loss.

40|$|The {{trade union}} {{movement}} around the world remains {{in the throes of}} a prolonged and deep decline, whether measured by membership and density, bargaining power in <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> <b>employers</b> or political influence over the ubiquitous neoliberal narrative that underpins the policies of many governments. Decline has not been arrested or reversed by the many strategic initiatives undertaken in recent years such as organising campaigns or coalition building, although it is possible that the state of the unions would be even more parlous if these initiatives had not been pursued. Against this bleak backcloth, there are some positive signs: unions representing specific occupations, such as school teachers, nurses and airline pilots, have retained high levels of density; and union confederations in many parts of Europe have launched successful general strikes against unpopular government reforms to pensions and welfare benefits. Unions need to position themselves as agencies that can help deal with the growing problems of wage stagnation, low wages, income inequality and insufficient economic demand. That in turn requires a coherent challenge to the dominant neoliberal narrative...|$|R

40|$|Introduction : Psychological {{contracts}} {{of safety}} are conceptualized as {{the beliefs of}} individuals about reciprocal safety obligations inferred from implicit or explicit promises. Although the literature on psychological contracts is growing, the existence of psychological contracts in <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> safety has not been established. The research sought to identify psychological contracts in the conversations of employees about safety, by demonstrating reciprocity in <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> <b>employer</b> and employee safety obligations. The identified safety obligations were used to develop a measure of psychological contracts of safety. Method : The participants were 131 employees attending safety training sessions in retail and manufacturing organizations. Non-participant observation was used to collect the data during safety training sessions. Content {{analysis was used to}} analyze the data. Categories for coding were established through identification of language markers that demonstrated contingencies or other implied obligations. Results : Direct evidence of reciprocity between employer safety obligations and employee safety obligations was found in statements from the participants demonstrating psychological contracts. A comprehensive list of perceived employer and employee safety obligations was compiled and developed into a measure of psychological contracts of safety. A small sample of 33 safety personnel was used to validate the safety obligations. Conclusions and impact on industry : Implications of these findings for safety and psychological contract research are discussed. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to point out the {{limitations}} of conventional approaches, articulated via political processes, in reducing income inequality. Using the panel data methods, on the sample of 21 affluent OECD countries in the period from 1980 to 2011, it is observed that the increase in labour productivity as well as preferences of voters to parties that advocate greater redistribution, contrary to common perception, not necessarily lead to reduction in income inequality. Increasing dominance of big capital in the field of technological progress changes the conventions about contribution of workers to labour productivity. The result is a weakening of workers’ bargaining power in <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> <b>employers</b> as well as increase in gap between labour productivity growth and real wage growth, which both lead to increase in income inequality. In comparison with the other political parties, it seems that the right-wing parties are more efficient in using voters’ support to implement their concept of the welfare state, which contributes to maintaining the high market-generated income inequality. Such situation could be explained that de jure power of the government depends on election results, whereas de facto power depends on the support of so-called globally-oriented super elites.

The theoretical part is concerned with a car perception in accounting and the influence of tax laws on the car perception. The theoretical part is divided into three main parts. The first part is focused on a general view of vehicles in accounting, for example, vehicle valuations, acquisitions, depreciation, valuation changes and disposals of vehicles. The other part is focused on specifications of the vehicle perception in a tax evidence of individual entrepreneurs. In the third part there are described the vehicle perception in business corporations. It is focused on a value-added tax, mainly on a value-added tax in cross-border buying and selling of vehicles. Furthermore, there are analyzed a deferred tax and issues of cars in a <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> <b>employers</b> and employees. In the theoretical part there is dealt with the usage of vehicles for private purposes. In the practical part there is analyzed the usages of company cars by an employee for private purposes. There is compared a rent and a free of charge usage. In this part there is also verified whether the law is followed in practice. There are stated atypical transactions. These include using grants to acquire a car, updating of a depreciation plan and disposing of a vehicle by its sale to a foreign entity...|$|R

40|$|This {{quantitative}} study examines {{the relationship between}} critical thinking and employability in the Malaysian higher education context. This research seeks future ICT graduates’ perceptions of their perceived ability and importance to employment of critical thinking strategies in <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> <b>employer</b> needs. The setting {{of this research was}} 10 public universities located in Malaysia and the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) where the employers of ICT companies were located. The research methodology consisted of surveys aimed at both future graduates and employers of ICT related companies following a mixed model approach. Three surveys were developed for this study, firstly, to capture the concerns of soon-to-be graduates in the IT sector and secondly, <b>employers</b> in <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> the employability of graduates. Thirdly, the research examines the critical thinking capabilities of students in <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> their future employment. Results indicate that student respondents rated their own critical thinking ability lower than what they perceived is needed in future work. Employers also express reservations about graduates’ readiness for employment. Findings suggest that the most basic employability skill apart from literacy and numeracy were communication skills, closely associated with soft skills. Additionally, findings stress the role of English language competency and a proactive, problem-solving approach as being welcome by employers. Both future graduates and employers stress the importance of non-job specific skills and this is supported overall by findings. This research suggests that faculties of higher level institutions should aim to design courses which include the skills that graduates need and employers expect. <b>Employers</b> need <b>to</b> communicate and collaborate with academia in <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> the competency levels of graduates to ensure undergraduates are provided with employability skills suited to Malaysia’s role in the 21 st century global economy. ...|$|R

40|$|The ICT {{sector in}} Ireland is {{currently}} experiencing rapid growth. Ireland {{is the second}} largest exporter of computer and IT services in the world (Enterprise Ireland, 2015). However, Ireland’s improving economy has led to significant skills shortages {{in a number of}} sectors including the ICT sector (Buckley, 2015). Although many strategies have been identified to attract and retain talent, retention and attraction are still two of the biggest challenges facing organisations. EB(EB) emerged in the 1990 ’s as a strategic tool to combat attraction and retention. For organisation’s to compete globally in the ‘War for Talent’, they must focus on incorporating organisation attributes into the employer brand (Berthon, Ewing, and Hah, 2005). A survey was conducted among prospective and CE in the ICT sector in Ireland. The aim of the survey was to identify if differences existed in <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> <b>employer</b> attractiveness attributes among the two groups in respect of organisation X in the ICT sector in Ireland. The data received from 58 PE and 49 CE found that {{there was no difference in}} overall attractiveness between the two groups, however, at a construct level differences did exist. The implications of this research project are considered, in light of researchers and human resource professionals. From the study, a number of practical recommendations are made.

40|$|A {{change in}} {{workplace}} technologies {{may affect the}} relative earnings of workers {{in at least two}} distinct ways. One is through the market for skill, the other through workers’ power in <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> their <b>employers.</b> Increases in earnings inequality since the late 1970 s in many industrial economies — and in particular, in liberal market economies like the US and UK — have been explained by many economists as a consequence of skill-biased technological change (SBTC). However, the evidence cited for SBTC can be read instead as evidence that new technologies affect the distribution of earnings not through supply and demand, but through changes in the relative power of different groups of employees. The reasons for these changes are detailed in Guy (2003) and the implications are analyzed more formally by Guy and Skott (2005) and Skott and Guy (2007) ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - This study aims {{to examine}} the antecedents of {{employee}} brand commitment (BC) and brand citizenship behaviours (BCB). In doing so, it also aims to propose a model which includes organisational socialisation, relationship orientation and employee receptiveness to explain the relationships between these three antecedents and BC and BCB. Design/methodology/approach - A quantitative research methodology was adopted {{which resulted in the}} development of a self-administered online survey instrument. As the population of interest was employees working in a service industry, a purposive sampling technique was adopted. Using a national database of service employees, a random sample of 2, 000 e-mail addresses was generated and respondents were invited to participate in the online survey. This resulted in the completion of 371 online surveys, representing a response rate of 19 per cent. Findings - The findings revealed a significant positive effect between organisational socialisation and BCB, but not with BC. On the other hand, relationship orientation was found to have a significant positive effect on BC, but not BCB. Employee receptiveness was the only antecedent to have a strong positive effect on both BC and BCB. Research limitations/implications - Given the findings, it appears that individual employee factors are extremely important in understanding how employees feel about and behave in <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> their <b>employer's</b> brand. Just as the external market literature reports numerous links between individual factors (i. e. personality, values, motivation, etc.) of consumers and consumption-related behaviour, the internal market literature will significantly benefit by adopting a similar line of enquiry in <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> employees. The acquisition of such knowledge will not only assist organisations in selecting "brand-oriented" employees, but will also help them identify, develop and nurture future brand champions. Practical implications - This study provides insight to managers that covet organisational success through the adoption of internal brand management practices. In particular, it empirically validates the significance of the receptivity of employees in enhancing not only their commitment to the brand but the exhibition of "pro" brand behaviours as well. Without employees that are first receptive to organisational dialogue, the intentions of internal brand management initiatives are unlikely to be realised. Originality/value - This study provides empirical evidence of the antecedents of employee brand commitment and subsequent brand behaviour. In doing so, it highlights the need to understand the pre-existing individual factors that employees bring to the employment exchange table, given that they significantly influence the way in which employees feel about and behave in <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> their <b>employer's</b> brand.

40|$|On the 19 th December 2012 the Supreme Court {{provided}} {{an answer to}} the longstanding question as to the consequences of a wrongfully repudiated contract of employment. Was it for the innocent party to elect to accept the repudiation to bring the contract to an end? Or, was the contract automatically ended upon the wrongful repudiation? Previous authorities had moved between these elective and automatic theories. The elective theory held that a wrongful repudiation only became effective where the innocent party elected to accept the repudiation. Conversely, the automatic theory considered that the contract ended automatically upon the repudiation. Whilst in traditional contract law, the elective theory had been established as effective, this was not decided with authority in contracts of employment. In Geys, the Supreme Court had the opportunity to consider which was the applicable theory in <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> an <b>employer’s</b> use of a payment-in-lieu of notice (PILON) clause.

40|$|The ‘Screen Writes’ Symposium {{explored}} the purposes {{and practices of}} writing as practice for BA students engaged in visual communication, including graphic design, advertising and animation. The idea of a symposium sprung from the new ‘writing and blogging’ course for Level 1 students at the London College of Communication (Mark Ingham, with Andrea Mason, Linda Stupart, Andrew Slatter and Harriet Edwards) : this will be critically analysed. The emphasis more generally is on writing practices emergent from studio concerns {{in line with the}} ethos of the Writing PAD project and its subsequent network. There will be time to discuss and exchange across roles and institutions in this symposium. The ‘Screen Writes’ symposium is intent on exploring a number of interconnected areas related to graduate attributes. Firstly, the role of creative writings in <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> voice and identity through the daily and weekly practice of making the student’s writing public using online presences, in this case a practice/theory blog. This allows the students to see writing as going from being a fairly passive, summatively driven activity, to one that is in constant formation. Secondly, it will explore the inherent mix that writing has with image and graphics in visual communication practices. This includes the surveying of tools and techniques employed when using online presences and how these can be used in such things as peer-to-peer learning. The idea that design and media students are writing with images will be analysed and challenged at this symposium. It will explore the possibilities of writing from images, writing with images, writing to images and writing against images. The beaten paths of these long and often debated relationships in academic writing will be taken off track to see if the clichés that surround these interactions in academia can be torn apart and reworked into more productive dynamic exchanges. Thirdly, the potential of such practices to create a presence in social medias with a view to professional purposes, or how blogging, and indeed tweeting, can link the students to communities and prospective avenues beyond the university, will be scrutinised. Students have been encouraged to think about their online presences in a number of ways. As a digital note book/sketchbook where ideas can be drafted, edited, reworked and published. It also made the students think about who they were writing for in a professional context. Fourthly, the articulation of the place, and merit of such practices within the wider design curriculum will be discussed.
