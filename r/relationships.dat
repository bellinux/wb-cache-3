5|$|Although {{homosexuality}} among females {{has taken}} place in many cultures in history, a recent phenomenon is the development of family among same-sex partners.

Unlike heterosexual <b>relationships</b> that tend to divide work based on sex roles, lesbian <b>relationships</b> divide chores evenly between both members.

This study assessed the influence of <b>relationship</b> proneness on <b>relationship</b> satisfaction and <b>relationship</b> commitment among domestic tourism clients within the Cape Town Metropolitan Area of South Africa. In spite of the increasing research on small tourism enterprises, they seem to be a paucity of studies that have investigated the influence of <b>relationship</b> proneness on <b>relationship</b> satisfaction and <b>relationship</b> commitment. The study utilised a quantitative research design using a structured questionnaire. The design was suitable to solicit the required information relating to <b>relationship</b> proneness, <b>relationship</b> satisfaction and <b>relationship</b> commitment. The findings indicate that <b>relationship</b> proneness has a positive influence on <b>relationship</b> satisfaction, <b>relationship</b> proneness has a positive influence on <b>relationship</b> commitment and <b>relationship</b> satisfaction exerts a positive influence on <b>relationship</b> commitment. All the posited three hypotheses were supported.
