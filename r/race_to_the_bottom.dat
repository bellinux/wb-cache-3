500|$|Jim Rickards, in his 2011 book [...] {{argues that}} the {{consequences}} of the Fed's attempts to prop up economic growth could be devastating for American national security. Though Rickard's book is largely concerned with currency war as competitive devaluation, it uses a broader definition of the term, classing policies that cause inflation as currency war. Such policies can be seen as metaphorical warfare against those who have monetary assets in favor of those who do not, but unless the effects of rising inflation on international trade are offset by a devaluation, inflationary policies tend to make a country's exports less competitive against foreign countries. In their review of the book, Publishers Weekly said: [...] "Rickards's first book is an outgrowth of his contributions and a later two-day war game simulation held at the Applied Physics Laboratory's Warfare Analysis Laboratory. He argues that a financial attack against the U.S. could destroy confidence in the dollar. In Rickards's view, the Fed's policy of quantitative easing by lessening confidence in the dollar, may lead to chaos in global financial markets." [...] Kirkus Reviews said: [...] "In Rickards' view, the world is currently going through a third currency war ("CWIII") based on competitive devaluations. CWII occurred in the 1960s and '70s and culminated in Nixon's decision to take the dollar off the gold standard. CWI followed World War I and included the 1923 German hyperinflation and Roosevelt's devaluation of the dollar against gold in 1933. Rickards demonstrates that competitive devaluations are a <b>race</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom,</b> and thus instruments of a sort of warfare. CWIII, he writes, is characterized by the Federal Reserve's policy of quantitative easing, which he ascribes to what he calls [...] "extensive theoretical work" [...] on depreciation, negative interest rates and stimulation achieved {{at the expense of other}} countries. He offers a view of how the continued depreciation and devaluation of the dollar will ultimately lead to a collapse, which he asserts will come about through a widespread abandonment of a worthless inflated instrument. Rickards also provides possible scenarios for the future, including collaboration among a variety of currencies, emergence of a world central bank and a forceful U.S. return to a gold standard through an emergency powers–based legal regime. The author emphasizes that these questions are matters of policy and choice, which can be different." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{origins of}} enduro {{mountain}} bike racing come from some inspiration from both car rally {{such as the}} World Rally Championship and motorbike enduro racing.

2500|$|A related area {{of concern}} is the {{pollution}} haven hypothesis, which posits that, when large industrialized nations seek to set up factories or offices abroad, they will often look for the cheapest option in terms of resources and labor that offers the land and material access they require (see <b>Race</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom).</b> This often comes {{at the cost of}} environmentally sound practices. Developing countries with cheap resources and labor tend to have less stringent environmental regulations, and conversely, nations with stricter environmental regulations become more expensive for companies {{as a result of the}} costs associated with meeting these standards. [...] Thus, companies that choose to physically invest in foreign countries tend to (re)locate to the countries with the lowest environmental standards or weakest enforcement.|$|E
2500|$|Also in the 1990s, U.S. states saw the {{opportunity}} to launch their own production incentives {{as an effort to}} capture some of the perceived economic benefits of film and TV production. [...] Louisiana was the first state to do so in 2001, and in 2002 passed legislation to further increase the scope its incentives. [...] Over the next three years Louisiana experienced an increase in film and television productions some of which were nominated for Emmy Awards. [...] The perceived success of Louisiana's incentive program did not go unnoticed by other states, and by 2009 the number of states which offered incentives was 44, up from 5 in 2002. [...] Critics have suggested that the increase in states offering incentives mirrors a <b>race</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> or an arms race because states continue to increase the scope of their incentive packages to compete on a national level to not only maximize their individual benefits but also to stay ahead of their competitors.|$|E
2500|$|Deposit brokers, {{somewhat}} like stockbrokers, are paid a commission by the customer {{to find the}} best certificate of deposit (CD) rates and place their customers' money in those CDs. Previously, banks and thrifts could only have five percent of their deposits be brokered deposits; the <b>race</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> caused this limit to be lifted. A small one-branch thrift could then attract a large number of deposits simply by offering the highest rate. To make money off this expensive money, it had to lend at even higher rates, meaning that it had to make more, riskier investments. This system was made even more damaging when certain deposit brokers instituted a scam known as [...] "linked financing". In [...] "linked financing", a deposit broker would approach a thrift and say he would steer a large amount of deposits to that thrift if the thrift would lend certain people money. The people, however, were paid a fee to apply for the loans and told to give the loan proceeds to the deposit broker.|$|E

2500|$|In {{regard to}} companies, the Court of Justice held in R (Daily Mail and General Trust plc) v HM Treasury that member states could {{restrict}} a company moving its seat of business, without infringing TFEU article 49. This meant the Daily Mail newspaper's parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first settling its tax {{bills in the}} UK. The UK {{did not need to}} justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark's minimum share capital rules. UK law only required £1 of capital to start a company, while Denmark's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 Danish krone (around €27,000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark's minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd's freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a <b>race</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> in legal standards, like the US state of Delaware, which is argued to attract companies with the worst standards of accountability, and unreasonably low corporate tax. Appearing to meet the concern, in Überseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany, simply because it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes. But in this case denial of capacity went too far: it was an [...] "outright negation" [...] of the right of establishment. Setting a further limit, in Cartesio Oktató és Szolgáltató bt the Court of Justice held that because corporations are created by law, they must be subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose. This meant the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy, while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary. Thus, the court draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies (where restrictions must be justified), and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory, although it is not entirely clear why.|$|E

While multilateralism argues that states are able to overcome prisoner dilemma situations by converging on international standards of regulation, comparative historical institutionalists assume ongoing diversity of regulatory frameworks.

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of scholars argue that the Commerce Clause is best read {{in light of the}} collective action problems that the nation faced under the Articles of Confederation. The work of these “collective action theorists” is reflected in Justice Ginsburg’s opinion in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius. Writing for four Justices, she stressed the “collective-action impasse” at <b>the</b> state level <b>to</b> which <b>the</b> Affordable Care Act responds. In its purest form, a collective action approach maintains that the existence of a significant problem of collective action facing two or more states is both necessary and sufficient for Congress <b>to</b> address <b>the</b> problem by relying on the Commerce Clause. Unlike nationalist defenders of unlimited federal commerce power, a collective action approach does not ask whether the regulated conduct substantially affects interstate commerce in the aggregate. Unlike federalist defenders of limited federal commerce power, a collective action approach does not focus on the distinction between economic and noneconomic conduct, or between regulating and requiring commerce. Accordingly, nationalists may agree that a collective action problem is sufficient for Congress <b>to</b> invoke <b>the</b> Commerce Clause, but they will disagree that it is necessary. By contrast, federalists may agree that a collective action problem is necessary for Congress <b>to</b> invoke <b>the</b> Commerce Clause, but they will disagree that it is sufficient. This Essay anticipates such criticism. Regarding the nationalist critique of a collective action approach, I argue that the nationalist “substantial effects” test imposes no judicially enforceable limits on the scope of the Commerce Clause. I also argue that nationalists may define multistate collective action problems too narrowly. In addition <b>to</b> <b>races</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom,</b> collective action problems include interstate externalities that do not cause <b>races</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom.</b> Broadening <b>the</b> definition of multistate collective action problems to include interstate externalities gives rise <b>to</b> <b>the</b> federalist objection that every subject Congress might want to address can plausibly be described as a collective action problem. Federalists may further object that the Commerce Clause is limited to “Commerce. ” In response, I argue that “Commerce” is best understood broadly to encompass many social interactions outside markets, as Professors Jack Balkin and Akhil Amar have urged. I also argue that a collective action approach need not validate unlimited federal commerce power. Specifically, I identify three ways of limiting the kinds of interstate externalities that justify use of the Commerce Clause...|$|R

40|$|Moral systems require {{individuals}} {{to act in}} service to their social groups. Despite <b>the</b> human tendency <b>to</b> view moral norms as invariant and constantly deserving of adherence, we vary {{not only in the}} moral norms that we espouse but also in <b>the</b> degree <b>to</b> which our behavior reflects those norms.

We propose that much observed variation in commitment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> group can be explained by a rule of stability-dependent cooperation, where the adaptive level of individual commitment varies inversely with the stability of the social group. This hypothesis is rooted in the understanding that humans are caught in an evolutionary trade-off between two methods of increasing reproductive success: competing with fellow group members, and increasing the stability of <b>the</b> group relative <b>to</b> other groups. If cooperation is stability dependent, however, human groups in times of high stability and low cooperation may be susceptible to fast-acting extrinsic threats, as well as self-destructive competitive <b>races</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom.</b> In light of this, we hypothesize that the absolutism and unchangeableness commonly attributed to moral norms serve a group stability insurance function and we present predictions from this hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|Ratifying core {{conventions}} {{adopted by}} the International Labor Organization (ILO) creates legal obligations to improve labor standards in the domestic economy, notably with regard to union rights, minimum age and discrimination in employment, and forced labor.

40|$|The European Union's {{aggressive}} response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{global financial}} crisis has prevented financial meltdown, but the continent's banking industry remains very fragile. Experts estimate coming losses {{in excess of}} $ 500 billion, with very little written down so far. These losses plus the problems in Eastern Europe portend widespread cross-border bank insolvencies. Traditional banking (in corporate finance and household savings) remains predominant in the European economies, so healing the banking system is crucial for sustained recovery in Europe. Lingering banking fragility would result in constant disruption or misallocation of bank credit and hinder returns to savers, thus depressing investment and consumption. Ongoing fragility will also harm European trend productivity growth by skipping some investment and R&D cycles, misallocating capital to lower-return projects, and wasting human capital by consigning some workers to long-term unemployment. It will take time and political will to create an EU banking supervisory architecture, but Europe cannot afford to wait. Posen and Véron recommend that Europe engage in system-wide "triage" of major banks on the continent by capital position, leading to public restructuring of the weakest ones. They propose that relevant countries jointly create a temporary supranational agency or Treuhand <b>to</b> implement <b>the</b> triage process, catalyze recapitalizations, and manage any distressed assets that would fall into public ownership.

40|$|Who {{speaks for}} Canada? For the past fifty years, during both the {{expansion}} and the retraction of the Canadian welfare state, {{the politics of}} social policy has revolved around this single question. In this article, I {{step back from the}} politics of social policy <b>to</b> reflect on <b>the</b> constitutional framework within which that politics occurs. My focus is the scope of the federal government’s jurisdiction over social policy. A distinctive feature of Canadian social policy since World War II has been the central role played by the federal government {{in the development of the}} Canadian welfare state, now commonly referred <b>to</b> as <b>the</b> social union. The federal role has been all the more remarkable in light of the constitutional limits on federal jurisdiction over social policy. Although jurisdiction over social policy has long been and continues to be disputed by both levels of government, I argue that underlying the politics of social policy lies a set of legal assumptions. These assumptions hold that the Constitution draws a sharp distinction between jurisdiction over the financing of contributory social insurance and social services, and jurisdiction over their design and delivery. Short of explicit constitutional amendment (as occurred in the case of unemployment insurance and pensions), federal jurisdiction is thought to be confined <b>to</b> <b>the</b> former realm, largely exercised through the use of the so-called federal spending power, whereas provincial jurisdiction encompasses both the former and the latter areas. In this article, I question this assumption, and argue that constitutional doctrine provides for federal jurisdiction over subject-matters where there is <b>the</b> risk of <b>races</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom...</b>|$|R
