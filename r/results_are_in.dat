5|$|Following genetic {{research}} in the early twenty-first century, the terns were historically treated as a separate family: Sternidae. Most terns were formerly treated as belonging to one large genus, Sterna, {{with just a few}} dark species placed in other genera; in 1959, only the noddies and the Inca tern were excluded from Sterna. A recent analysis of DNA sequences supported the splitting of Sterna into several smaller genera. One study of part of the cytochrome b gene sequence found a close relationship between terns and a group of waders in the suborder Thinocori. These <b>results</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> disagreement with other molecular and morphological studies, and have been interpreted as showing either a large degree of molecular convergent evolution between the terns and these waders, or the retention of an ancient genotype.|$|E

Gravitational time dilation in the Earth's gravitational field has been measured numerous times using atomic clocks, while ongoing validation is provided as {{a side effect of}} the operation of the Global Positioning System (GPS). Tests in stronger gravitational fields are provided by the observation of binary pulsars. All <b>results</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> agreement with general relativity. However, at the current level of accuracy, these observations cannot distinguish between general relativity and other theories in which the equivalence principle is valid.|$|E

Thomas Rozwadowski of Green Bay Press-Gazette placed the episode among his list of the ten best episodes of the show which have lessons: [...] "Corrupt politicians always get their comeuppance.

According to BBC, his weight was in the acceptable range {{for a man of}} his height, but he had punctured arms and suffered from lung damage and some arthritis. The document shows that Jackson's most serious health problem was his chronically inflamed lungs, but this was not serious enough to be a contributing factor to his death. The post mortem did not uncover any physical problems that may [...] have limited Jackson's ability to perform. [...] "His overall health was fine," [...] said Dr. Zeev Kain of the University of California, who reviewed the report for AP but was not involved in the post-mortem examination, [...] "The <b>results</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> normal limits."

2500|$|Backward error analysis, {{the theory}} of which was {{developed}} and popularized by James H. Wilkinson, {{can be used to}} establish that an algorithm implementing a numerical function is numerically stable. The basic approach is to show that although the calculated result, due to roundoff errors, will not be exactly correct, it is the exact solution to a nearby problem with slightly perturbed input data. If the perturbation required is small, on the order of the uncertainty in the input data, then the <b>results</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> some sense as accurate as the data [...] "deserves". The algorithm is then defined as backward stable. Stability {{is a measure of the}} sensitivity to rounding errors of a given numerical procedure; [...] by contrast, the condition number of a function for a given problem indicates the inherent sensitivity of the function to small perturbations in its input and is independent of the implementation used to solve the problem.|$|E
2500|$|A 2013 {{study by}} PJ Oefner, et al. found that [...] "Samaritans are {{descendants}} from the tribes of Israel dating to before the Assyrian exile in 722-720 BCE. In concordance with previously published single-nucleotide polymorphism haplotypes, each Samaritan family, {{with the exception}} of the Samaritan Cohen lineage, was observed to carry a distinctive Y-chromosome short tandem repeat haplotype that was not more than one mutation removed from the six-marker Cohen modal haplotype" [...] The authors concluded that [...] "Taken together, our results suggest that there has been gene fow between non-Samaritan females and the Samaritan population to a signifcantly greater extent than for males. The male lineages of the Samaritans, on the other hand, seem to have considerable afinity with those of the five non-Ethiopian Jewish populations examined here. These <b>results</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> accordance with expectations based on the endogamous and patrilineal marriage customs of the Samaritans and provide support for an ancient genetic relationship between Samaritans and Israelites." ...|$|E

The {{rounded end}} of a brass rod, 0.3 of an inch in diameter, {{was covered with a}} {{positive}} glow by the working of an electrical machine: on stopping the machine, so that the charge of the connected conductor should fall, the glow changed for a moment into brushes just before the discharge ceased altogether, illustrating the necessity for a certain high continuous charge, for a certain sized termination. Working the machine so that the intensity should be just low enough to give continual brushes from the end in free air, the approach of a fine point changed these brushes into a glow. Working the machine so that the termination presented a continual glow in free air, the gradual approach of the hand caused the glow to contract {{at the very end of}} the wire, then to throw out a luminous point, which, becoming a foot stalk (1426.), finally produced brushes with large ramifications. All these <b>results</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> accordance with what is stated above (1539.).|$|E

The comparatively simple organization under which our ancestors lived five centuries ago, could have undergone but few modifications from an event like the recent one at Canton; but now, the legislative decision respecting it sets up many hundreds of complex modifications, each of which will be the parent of numerous future ones.|$|E
