2500|$|Strobe units {{can often}} be {{calibrated}} for many tunings and preset temperaments and allow for custom temperament programming, stretched tuning, [...] "sweetened" [...] temperament tunings and Buzz Feiten tuning modifications. [...] Due to their accuracy and ability to display partials even on instruments with a very short [...] "voice" [...] (e.g., notes of short duration), strobe tuners can perform tuning tasks {{that would be very}} difficult, if not impossible, for needle-type tuners. For instance, needle/LED display type tuners cannot track the signal to identify a tone of the Caribbean steelpan (often nicknamed the [...] "steeldrum") due to its very short [...] "voice". A tuner {{needs to be able to}} detect the first few partials for tuning such an instrument, which means that only a strobe tuner can be used for steelpan tuning. This is also true of the comb teeth used in mechanical musical instruments like Music Boxes and the like. In such cases a technician has to physically <b>remove</b> <b>metal</b> from the [...] tooth to reach the desired note. The metal teeth only resonates briefly when plucked. Great accuracy is required as once the metal is cut or filed away, the lost material cannot be replaced. As such, the strobe-type tuners are the unit of choice for such tasks. Tuners with an accuracy of better than 0.2 cent are required for guitar intonation tuning.|$|E

50|$|Leaching is {{extensively}} used {{in metal}} processing industries. The useful metal may occur in mixtures with very {{large amounts of}} undesirable constituents, and leaching is used to <b>remove</b> the <b>metals</b> as soluble salts. The use of acids is prevalent in the metal processing industry. Sulfates are normally used to <b>remove</b> <b>metals</b> from the solid phase. These processes result in harmful sulfate-rich environmental byproducts. Because acids solubilize metals, large-scale release of heavy-metal-rich acidic mine drainage (AMD) can thereby occur.|$|R
50|$|Chelating {{groups have}} also been covalently bound to silica gel. These {{materials}} {{have the ability to}} <b>remove</b> <b>metal</b> ions selectively from aqueous media. Chelating groups can be covalently bound to polyamines that have been grafted onto a silica gel surface producing a material of greater mechanical integrity. Silica gel is also combined with alkali metals to form a M-SG reducing agent.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Sulfate {{reducing}} bioreactors (SRBRs) are {{a passive}} treatment technology {{used to treat}} low pH, metal-laden, acid rock drainage waters. SRBRs are an attractive alternative to traditional active water treatment because they are low-cost and low-maintenance. SRBRs rely on two mechanisms to <b>remove</b> <b>metals</b> and increase alkalinity; a biotic, or bacteria-mediated, process that precipitates metals as sulfides and an abiotic mechanism which <b>removes</b> <b>metals</b> via precipitation or sorption. The bacteria-mediated mechanism is affected by seasonal temperature fluctuations especially in mountainous environments with large annual temperature fluctuations. Treatment data from a two-year old pilot scale SRBR allows characterization of the seasonal variation of both metal removal mechanisms.

50|$|Rather {{than using}} a pattern grinder to <b>remove</b> <b>metal,</b> keys {{may also be}} {{duplicated}} with a punch machine. The key to be duplicated is measured for the depth of each notch with a gauge and then placed into a device with a numeric slider. The slider is adjusted to match the corresponding measured depth and a lever is depressed, which cuts the entire notch at once. As the lever is raised the key automatically advances to the next indexed position and the slider is adjusted appropriately to the next measured depth. This cycle is continued until the key is complete.|$|E
5000|$|The naming ("honing" [...] or [...] "sharpening") {{is often}} a misnomer, because the {{traditional}} [...] "honing steel" [...] neither hones nor sharpens a blade. Instead, its function is to realign a curled edge rather than <b>remove</b> <b>metal</b> from the edge. The term [...] "hone" [...] is associated with light maintenance performed on a blade without the effort and precision normally associated with sharpening, so the name [...] "hone" [...] was loaned. In the 1980s, ceramic abrasives became increasingly popular, and proved an equal, if not superior, method for accomplishing the same daily maintenance tasks; manufacturers replaced steels with ceramic (and later, manufactured diamond abrasive) sharpening [...] "steels" [...] that were, in fact, hones.|$|E
50|$|An {{unfinished}} workpiece requiring machining {{will need}} to have some material cut away to create a finished product. A finished product would be a workpiece that meets the specifications set out for that workpiece by engineering drawings or blueprints. For example, a workpiece may be required to have a specific outside diameter. A lathe is a machine tool {{that can be used to}} create that diameter by rotating a metal workpiece, so that a cutting tool can cut metal away, creating a smooth, round surface matching the required diameter and surface finish. A drill can be used to <b>remove</b> <b>metal</b> in the shape of a cylindrical hole. Other tools that may be used for various types of metal removal are milling machines, saws, and grinding machines. Many of these same techniques are used in woodworking.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} examines metal {{release from}} freshwater sediment using sequential extraction and single-step cold-acid leaching. The concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb and Zn released using a standard 3 -step sequential extraction (Rauret et al., 1999) are {{compared to those}} released using a 0. 5 M HCl; leach. The {{results show that the}} three sediments behave in very different ways when subject to the same leaching experiments: the cold-acid extraction appears to remove higher relative concentrations of metals from the iron-rich sediment than from the other two sediments. Cold-acid extraction appears to be more effective at <b>removing</b> <b>metals</b> from sediments with crystalline iron oxides than the "reducible" step of the sequential extraction. The results show that a single-step acid leach can be just as effective as sequential extractions at <b>removing</b> <b>metals</b> from sediment and are a great deal less time-consuming...|$|R

5000|$|The {{effect of}} {{transition}} metals {{on some of}} the bleaching stages has already been mentioned. Sometimes it is beneficial to remove some of these metal ions from the pulp by washing the pulp with a chelating agent such as EDTA or DTPA. This is more common in TCF bleaching sequences for two reasons: the acidic chlorine or chlorine dioxide stages tend to <b>remove</b> <b>metal</b> ions (metal ions usually being more soluble at lower pH) and TCF stages rely more heavily on oxygen-based bleaching agents, which are more susceptible to the detrimental effects of these metal ions. Chelant washes are usually carried out at or near pH 7. Lower pH solutions are more effective at removing transition metals, but also remove more of the beneficial metal ions, especially magnesium ...|$|E
5000|$|Addition of Zn0, Mn0, or sodiumamalgam is {{commonly}} seen {{in combination with}} these NiX2 salts. [...] A common additive in these cross-coupling reactions is NaI, which some authors have proposed could serve to help promote the electron transfer between Mn and Ni. Weix and coworkers found that by activating the Zn with 2% HCl for 1 minute, reaction times were significantly decreased with little change in the overall yield. Similarly, TMSCl {{can be used to}} activate the Mn powder. Both of these techniques <b>remove</b> <b>metal</b> oxides {{on the surface of the}} dust, which may inhibit reactivity. Due to the heterogeneity of the reaction mixture, yields are contingent on the rate of stirring, which can pose a problem for larger scale (i.e. process-scale) reactions. Additionally, Weix and coworkers found that reactivity is also contingent on the source and size of the zinc dust.|$|E
50|$|On {{the theory}} that pieces in major keys may better be accommodated, after many {{unsatisfactory}} attempts, in the 1980s, using computer modeling for assistance in design by scientists at the Technical University in Eindhoven, bells with a major-third profile were created by the Eijsbouts Bellfoundry in the Netherlands, being described as resembling old Coke bottles in {{that they have a}} bulge around the middle; and in 1999 a design without the bulge was announced.Although bells are cast to accurate patterns, variations in casting mean that a final operation of tuning is undertaken as the shape of the bell is critical in producing the desired strike note and associated harmonics. Tuning is undertaken by clamping the bell on a large rotating table, and using a cutting tool to <b>remove</b> <b>metal.</b> Much experimentation and research has been devoted to determining the exact shape that will give the best tone.|$|E
