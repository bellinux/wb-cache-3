5|$|Downstream from {{confluence}} of the Drina, the Sava River changes its eastward course to northeast, until it reaches Sremska Mitrovica, from where it flows to the southeast and then south to Šabac, before finally turning east towards Belgrade. Most of the river's course in Serbia represents a border between province of Vojvodina, on the left bank, and Central Serbia, on the <b>right</b> <b>bank.</b> Exceptions to that are in area around Sremska Mitrovica, where both banks are in Vojvodina, and downstream of Progar suburb of Belgrade where both banks are in Central Serbia. The river meanders and forms wetlands in there as well—the most significant wetland among them centering on Obedska bara oxbow lake. The Sava River forms several large islands in this segment of the course, with the largest among them— Ada Ciganlija in Belgrade—connected to the <b>right</b> <b>bank</b> {{by a pair of}} artificial embankment dams forming Lake Sava since 1967.|$|E
5|$|The network {{spread quickly}} through various city-centre districts on the <b>right</b> <b>bank</b> of the Seine, {{to reach the}} suburbs of the {{northern}} plateau, the hills of Bonsecours in the east, skirting around the textile valley of the River Cailly in the west, crossing the river and serving, in the south, the suburbs and industrial districts of the left bank.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{logistical}} problems, the new Polish Commander-in-Chief Jan Krukowiecki, who {{had replaced}} Dembiński in mid-August, ordered a sortie on the <b>right</b> <b>bank.</b> Like his predecessor, Krukowiecki was a conservative and believed the main {{aim of the}} November Uprising was {{the return of the}} status quo ante with the tsars of Russia as kings of Poland, but respecting the constitution and Polish laws. Unlike Skrzynecki, he believed foreign intervention to be unrealistic, and wanted to force the Russians to return to peace talks by defeating the Russian forces, breaking the siege or defeating the assault attempts.|$|E

While the city of Vukovar itself had an ethnically mixed population (47.2 percent Croats and 32.2 percent Serbs), smaller settlements in the area were more homogenous. Fourteen were predominantly populated by Croats, ten (including Borovo Selo) by Serbs, two by Ruthenians and the remaining two were ethnically mixed.|$|E

5|$|Paris' {{cultural}} centre {{had begun to}} move to the <b>Right</b> <b>Bank,</b> after the draining of its former swampland made the land habitable and fit for crops. In 1137, a new city marketplace (where Les Halles is today) replaced the two smaller ones on the Île de la Cité and Place de la Grève (Hotel de Ville). The latter location housed the headquarters of Paris' river trade corporation, an organisation that later became, unofficially (although formally in later years), Paris' first municipal government.|$|E

5|$|Since {{there were}} only 40 trained drivers in the Logorište barracks, Boro Ercegovac ordered {{soldiers}} who had never operated military vehicles to drive in a column starting from the barracks under fire at 3:30p.m. As the column advanced south towards Malići, elements of the 110th Infantry Brigade retreated {{from the village of}} Zastinja (on the <b>right</b> <b>bank</b> of the Korana River). The evacuating JNA column sustained casualties, although it was supported by the 9th Motorised Brigade and two detachments of the SAO Krajina TO from Vojnić. The SAO Krajina TO were later accused of killing civilians in the area.|$|E
5|$|The Bradley brook joins on the <b>right</b> <b>bank</b> at Hambrook {{just before}} the river passes {{underneath}} the M4 motorway.

Turning in a more south westerly direction the river enters Oldbury Court estate, a city park also known as Vassal's, past Snuff Mills, entering a steep valley at Stapleton, then passing Eastville park, where it feeds the former boating lake and is met by the Fishponds brook on the right.|$|E
5|$|According {{to the new}} strategy, {{the forces}} under Girolamo Ramorino and Tomasz Łubieński were {{to leave the city}} and stay on the <b>right</b> <b>bank</b> of the Vistula, harass the Russian forces under von Rosen and von Rüdiger, capture the river {{crossings}} at Osiek, provide the city with supplies, and force Paskevich to divert some of his forces to fight them. Both forces left the city between 16 and 20 August 1831. Tomasz Łubieński's Corps headed towards Płock, broke the encirclement, and delivered much-needed supplies to Warsaw. His forces also broke the northern line of communications between Paskevich's forces and East Prussia. Girolamo Ramorino's II Corps in Podlasie defeated von Rosen's Corps in several clashes, including the battles of Międzyrzec and Rogoźnica. Ramorino's indecisiveness and disregard for orders allowed the defeated and numerically inferior Russians to retreat towards Brześć Litewski and avoid complete destruction.|$|E

5|$|By 1678, Frederick William {{had cleared}} Swedish Pomerania and {{occupied}} most of it, {{with the exception}} of Rügen which was held by Denmark–Norway. This was followed by another success against Sweden, when Frederick William cleared Prussia of Swedish forces in {{what became known as the}} Great Sleigh Drive. However, when Louis XIV of France concluded the Dutch War by the Nijmegen treaties, he marched his armies east to relieve his Swedish ally, and forced Frederick William to basically return to the status quo ante bellum by the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679). Though the Scanian War resulted only in minor territorial gains, attaching a small strip of the Swedish Pomeranian <b>right</b> <b>bank</b> of the lower Oder to Brandenburg-Prussian Pomerania, the war resulted in a huge gain of prestige for the elector.|$|E
5|$|By May 1947, {{authorities}} in Vojvodina {{noted that there}} was a dispute between them and the {{authorities in}} Croatia regarding the interpretation of the position of the border along the Danube, and that the federal authorities, who were asked to mediate in the dispute, supported the position of Croatia. At the same time, Vojvodina requested that Croatia return the territories on the <b>right</b> <b>bank</b> of the Danube that had previously been ceded to it (Varoš-Viza and Mala Siga). While in the Yugoslav framework, the issue received little further attention as its resolution was discouraged by the federal authorities, and because the area involved had limited economic value, was uninhabited and frequently flooded.|$|E
5|$|In 1821, {{revenue was}} 816,444 francs, {{and the company}} paid a {{dividend}} of 555,500 francs. The company was able to raise its rates without reducing traffic. In 1822, the canal earned almost a million francs from carrying 243,200 tons of coal and 96,000 tons of other merchandise. The concession holders had repaid most of the debts they had incurred to build the canal, including many improvements since it was opened, {{and were able to}} pay healthy dividends. By 1824, the canal was giving annual revenues of 850,000 francs. An 1824 account described a superb water station at Givors on the <b>right</b> <b>bank</b> of the Rhone, an excellent basin at Rive-de-Gier for loading, fine buildings for administration of the canal and spacious shops and warehouses.|$|E

5|$|In 2014, Belgrade Waterfront, a {{catalytic}} development, {{has been}} initiated {{headed by the}} Government of Serbia aimed at improving Belgrade's cityscape and economy by revitalizing the Sava amphitheater, a neglected stretch of land on the <b>right</b> <b>bank</b> of the Sava river, between the Belgrade Fair and Belgrade Main railway station. Around €3.5 billion will be invested by the Serbian government and their Emirati partners. The project includes office and luxury apartment buildings, five-star hotels, a shopping mall and Belgrade Tower. The project is, however, considered by many as 'controversial', since {{there are a number}} of uncertainties regarding its funding, necessity, as well as chosen architectural solutions.|$|E
5|$|In the Second Battle of Zürich, the French regained {{control of}} the city, {{along with the rest}} of Switzerland. Notably, Masséna out-generaled Korsakov; {{surrounded}} him, tricked him, and then took more than half his army as a prisoner. Massena also captured the baggage train and most of Korsakov cannons, and inflicted over 8,000 casualties. Most of the fighting took place on both banks of the river Limmat, up to the gates of Zürich, and in part within the city itself. Zürich had declared itself neutral, and was spared general destruction. General Oudinot commanded the French forces on the <b>right</b> <b>bank</b> and general Joseph Mortier, those on the left.|$|E
5|$|On {{receiving}} {{news of the}} siege, Farnese dispatched {{the governor}} of Friesland, Francisco Verdugo, to Borculo with 400 infantry and two cavalry companies, and Verdugo's lieutenant Johann Baptista von Taxis to Zutphen with 600 infantry and two cavalry companies. As the siege continued, Farnese left some troops to blockade Rheinberg and supplied Zutphen in person with 600 cavalry and a convoy of 300 wagons of wheat. Leicester was in Deventer then, but on receiving news of Farnese's approach, he returned to Zutphen's camp. He found, on his arrival, that Counts Philip of Hohenlohe-Neuenstein and William Louis of Nassau-Dillenburg had entrenched the army on a hillock along the <b>right</b> <b>bank</b> of the IJssel. Leicester was informed of the possible ways through which the Spanish army might attempt to supply the town, but because of a misunderstanding no troops were deployed to guard the roads.|$|E
