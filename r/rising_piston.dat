50|$|The {{hot-bulb}} engine {{is a type}} of internal combustion engine in which fuel ignites by coming in contact with a red-hot metal surface inside a bulb, followed by the introduction of air (oxygen) compressed into the hot-bulb chamber by the <b>rising</b> <b>piston.</b> There is some ignition when the fuel is introduced, but it quickly uses up the available oxygen in the bulb. Vigorous ignition takes place only when sufficient oxygen is supplied to the hot-bulb chamber on the compression stroke of the engine.|$|E

5000|$|However: {{intake valve}} closure (sealing the cylinder) always takes place after BDC, which may cause {{some of the}} intake charge to be {{compressed}} backwards out of the cylinder by the <b>rising</b> <b>piston</b> at very low speeds; only {{the percentage of the}} stroke after intake valve closure is compressed.

50|$|Harry Ricardo’s {{contribution}} was {{to understand the}} combustion process and develop a cylinder head that retained the simplicity and the low cost of the side valve layout, but which rethought the shape of the combustion chamber to provide both the greater compression required for power, and the improved gas mixing that he realised was essential for stable combustion and the avoidance of damaging detonation. This he achieved with an asymmetric profile to the combustion chamber which used a squish effect to induce turbulence in the gases above the <b>rising</b> <b>piston,</b> compressing them into the chamber to one side, where they were ignited by the spark plug.|$|E

40|$|New geochemical {{proxy data}} from Bermuda <b>Rise</b> <b>piston</b> cores reveal ocean and climate {{conditions}} in the northern Sargasso Sea during marine isotope stage 3. Using ? 18 O on the planktonic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber, we can correlate explicitly with every stadial/interstadial change in Greenland ice between ~ 32 and 58 ka. These data suggest repetitive changes of ~ 4 °C in the annual average sea surface temperature (SST), with maximum cooling comparable {{to or greater than}} SST during glacial maximum conditions. The extent of SST depression is about the same for typical stadial events and for Heinrich events 4 and 5, which we have identified on the Bermuda Rise by traces of ice rafting. Benthic foraminiferal d 13 C decreases during every stadial event, consistent with reduced production of the deepest component of North Atlantic Deep Water and shoaling of its interface with Antarctic Bottom Water. This interpretation is supported by benthic Cd/Ca data from the climate cycle associated with interstadial 8...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} type of annular {{blowout preventer}} uses a “wedge-faced” (conical-faced) piston. As the <b>piston</b> <b>rises,</b> vertical {{movement of the}} packing unit is restricted by the head and the sloped face of the piston squeezes the packing unit inward, {{toward the center of}} the wellbore.|$|R
50|$|The BSA A7, Meguro K {{and their}} {{respective}} derivatives have an overhead valve (i.e., pushrod) straight-twin engine with a pre-unit construction architecture. All have a 360° crankshaft angle, which provides an even firing interval between the two cylinders but high vibration caused by the two <b>pistons</b> <b>rising</b> and falling together.|$|R
5000|$|The {{single-acting}} uniflow {{steam engine}} configuration closely {{resembles that of}} a two-stroke internal combustion engine, {{and it is possible}} to convert a two-stroke engine to a uniflow steam engine by feeding the cylinder with steam via a [...] "bash valve" [...] fitted in place of the spark plug. As the <b>rising</b> <b>piston</b> nears the top of its stroke, it knocks open the bash valve to admit a pulse of steam. The valve closes automatically as the piston descends, and the steam is exhausted through the existing cylinder porting. The inertia of the flywheel then carries the piston back to the top of its stroke against the compression, as it does in the original form of the engine. Also like the original, the conversion is not self-starting and must be turned over by an external power source to start. An example of such a conversion is the steam-powered moped, which is started by pedalling.|$|E
50|$|No springs are {{involved}} in the sleeve valve system, therefore the power needed to operate the valve remains largely constant with the engine's RPM, meaning that the system can be used at very high speeds with no penalty for doing so. A problem with high-speed engines that use poppet valves is that as engine speed increases, the speed at which the valve moves also has to increase. This in turn increases the loads involved due to the inertia of the valve, which has to be opened quickly, brought to a stop, then reversed in direction and closed and brought to a stop again. Large poppet valves that allow good air-flow have considerable mass and require a strong spring to overcome their inertia when closing. At higher engine speeds, the valve spring may be unable to close the valve before the next opening event, resulting in a failure to completely close. This effect, called valve float, can result in the valve being struck by the top of the <b>rising</b> <b>piston.</b> In addition, camshafts, push-rods, and valve rockers can be eliminated in a sleeve valve design, as the sleeve valves are generally driven by a single gear powered from the crankshaft. In an aircraft engine, this provided desirable reductions in weight and complexity.|$|E
50|$|The p-V diagam is a {{simplified}} and idealised {{representation of the}} events involved in a Diesel engine cycle, arranged to illustrate the similarity with a Carnot cycle. Starting at 1, the piston is at bottom dead centre and both valves are closed {{at the start of}} the compression stroke; the cylinder contains air at atmospheric pressure. Between 1 and 2 the air is compressed adiabatically—that is without heat transfer to or from the environment—by the <b>rising</b> <b>piston.</b> (This is only approximately true since there will be some heat exchange with the cylinder walls.) During this compression, the volume is reduced, the pressure and temperature both rise. At or slightly before 2 (TDC) fuel is injected and burns in the compressed hot air. Chemical energy is released and this constitutes an injection of thermal energy (heat) into the compressed gas. Combustion and heating occur between 2 and 3. In this interval the pressure remains constant since the piston descends, and the volume increases; the temperature rises as a consequence of the energy of combustion. At 3 fuel injection and combustion are complete, and the cylinder contains gas at a higher temperature than at 2. Between 3 and 4 this hot gas expands, again approximately adiabatically. Work is done on the system to which the engine is connected. During this expansion phase the volume of the gas rises, and its temperature and pressure both fall. At 4 the exhaust valve opens, and the pressure falls abruptly to atmospheric (approximately). This is unresisted expansion and no useful work is done by it. Ideally the adiabatic expansion should continue, extending the line 3-4 to the right until the pressure falls to that of the surrounding air, but the loss of efficiency caused by this unresisted expansion is justified by the practical difficulties involved in recovering it (the engine would have to be much larger). After the opening of the exhaust valve, the exhaust stroke follows, but this (and the following induction stroke) are not shown on the diagram. If shown, they would be represented by a low-pressure loop at the bottom of the diagram. At 1 it is assumed that the exhaust and induction strokes have been completed, and the cylinder is again filled with air. The piston-cylinder system absorbs energy between 1 and 2—this is the work needed to compress the air in the cylinder, and is provided by mechanical kinetic energy stored in the flywheel of the engine. Work output is done by the piston-cylinder combination between 2 and 4. The difference between these two increments of work is the indicated work output per cycle, and is represented by the area enclosed by the p-V loop. The adiabatic expansion is in a higher pressure range than that of the compression because the gas in the cylinder is hotter during expansion than during compression. It is for this reason that the loop has a finite area, and the net output of work during a cycle is positive.|$|E
50|$|In 1972, Ado N. Vujasinovic {{was awarded}} a patent for a {{variation}} on the annular preventer known as a spherical blowout preventer, so-named because of its spherical-faced head. As the <b>piston</b> <b>rises</b> the packing unit is thrust upward against the curved head, which constricts the packing unit inward. Both types of annular preventer are in common use.|$|R
5000|$|In a 180° engine, one <b>piston</b> <b>rises</b> as {{the other}} falls. This gives good primary balance, albeit with a rocking couple; but results in {{irregular}} ignition pulses. This is because cylinder 2 fires 180 degrees after cylinder 1, and cylinder 1 does not fire again for another 540 degrees - always adding up to the 720 degrees of rotation for a four-stroke cycle.|$|R
5000|$|In a 360° engine, both <b>pistons</b> <b>rise</b> {{and fall}} together. The dynamic balance is {{identical}} {{to that of a}} single-cylinder engine, but with twice the number of ignition pulses. The firing order is offset, so that cylinder 2 fires 360 degrees after cylinder 1, and 360 degrees later cylinder 1 fires again at 720 total degrees, the beginning of another four-stroke cycle.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from large}} diesels with {{separate}} superchargers, two-stroke engines are generally piston-ported {{and use their}} crankcase beneath the piston for compression. The cylinder has a transfer port (inlet from crankcase to cylinder) and an exhaust port cut into it. These are opened, as the piston moves downwards past them; with the higher exhaust port opening earlier as the piston descends; and closing later as the <b>piston</b> <b>rises.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Like its contemporaries in {{its class}} the XS 650 has a 360° crank angle. This {{provides}} an even firing interval {{between the two}} cylinders, but also generates some vibration caused by the two <b>pistons</b> <b>rising</b> and falling together. This vibration is particularly noticeable at idle. Because of a long-acknowledged vibration issue, starting with the 1974 models, vibration damping modifications {{were made to the}} engine and handlebar mountings.|$|R
50|$|Air {{is drawn}} into the {{cylinder}} through the intake valve as the piston descends (the induction stroke). During the same stroke, fuel is sprayed into the vaporizer by a mechanical (jerk-type) fuel pump through a nozzle. The air in the cylinder is then forced through {{the top of the}} cylinder as the <b>piston</b> <b>rises</b> (the compression stroke), through the opening into the vaporizer, where it is compressed and its temperature rises. The vaporized fuel mixes with the compressed air and ignites primarily due to the heat of the hot bulb generated while running, or heat applied to the hot bulb prior to starting. By contracting the bulb to a very narrow neck where it attaches to the cylinder, a high degree of turbulence is set up as the ignited gases flash through the neck into the cylinder, where combustion is completed. The resulting pressure drives the piston down (the power stroke). The piston's action is converted to a rotary motion by the crankshaft-flywheel assembly, to which equipment can be attached for work to be performed. The flywheel stores momentum, some of which is used to turn the engine when power is not being produced. The <b>piston</b> <b>rises,</b> expelling exhaust gases through the exhaust valve (the exhaust stroke). The cycle then starts again.|$|R
5000|$|... ===Exhaust stroke=== The {{exhaust stroke}} {{is the fourth}} of four stages in a four stroke {{internal}} combustion engine cycle. In this stage gases remaining in the cylinder from the fuel ignited during the compression step are removed from the cylinder through an exhaust valve {{at the top of}} the cylinder. The gases are forced up to the top of the cylinder as the <b>piston</b> <b>rises</b> and are pushed through the opening, which then closes to allow a fresh air/fuel mixture into the cylinder so the process can repeat itself.|$|R
5000|$|As the <b>piston</b> <b>rises,</b> {{the intake}} charge of air is compressed. Near top dead center, fuel is injected, {{resulting}} in combustion {{due to the}} charge's extremely high pressure and heat created by compression, which drives the piston downward. As the piston moves downward in the cylinder, it will {{reach a point where}} the exhaust port is opened to expel the high-pressure combustion gasses. However, most current two-stroke diesel engines use top-mounted poppet valves and uniflow scavenging. Continued downward movement of the piston will expose the air intake ports in the cylinder wall, and the cycle will start again.|$|R
5000|$|A {{large number}} of small {{two-stroke}} engines use a sealed crankcase as a compression chamber for their mixture. These are hugely common as petrol or gasoline small engines for motorcycles, generator sets and garden equipment. Both sides of the piston are used as working surfaces: the upper side is the power piston, the lower side acts as a scavenging pump. As the <b>piston</b> <b>rises,</b> it pushes out exhaust gases and produces a partial vacuum in the crankcase, which draws in fuel and air. As the piston travels downward, the compressed fuel/air charge is pushed from the crankcase into the cylinder.|$|R
40|$|The {{unsteady}} {{pressure gradient}} can cause flow noise in prepressure <b>rising</b> of <b>piston</b> pump, and the fluid shock comes up {{due to the}} large pressure difference of the piston chamber and discharge port in valve plate. The flow fluctuation control is the optimization objective in previous study, which cannot ensure the steady pressure gradient. Our study is to stabilize the pressure gradient in prepressure rising and control the pressure of piston chamber approaching to the pressure in discharge port after prepressure rising. The models for nonoil shock and dynamic pressure of piston chamber in prepressure rising are established. The parameters of prepressure rising angle, cross angle, wrap angle of V-groove, vertex angle of V-groove, and opening angle of V-groove were optimized, based on which {{the pressure of the}} piston chamber approached the pressure in discharge port after prepressure rising, and the pressure gradient is more steady compared to the original parameters. The max pressure gradient decreased by 70. 8 % and the flow fluctuation declined by 21. 4 %, which showed the effectivness of optimization...|$|R
5000|$|Because {{there is}} no {{obstruction}} in the cylinder of the fuel to move directly out of the exhaust port prior to the <b>piston</b> <b>rising</b> far enough to close the port, early engines used a high domed piston {{to slow down the}} flow of fuel. Later the fuel was [...] "resonated" [...] back into the cylinder using an expansion chamber design. When the piston rose close to TDC a spark ignites the fuel. As the piston is driven downward with power it first uncovers the exhaust port where the burned fuel is expelled under high pressure and then the intake port where the process has been completed and will keep repeating.|$|R
5000|$|The {{benefits}} of direct injection {{are even more}} pronounced in two-stroke engines, because it eliminates much of the pollution they cause. In all two-strokes other than those with split-single engines or similarly sophisticated arrangements, the exhaust and intake ports are both open at the same time, {{at the bottom of}} the piston stroke, for [...] "scavenging". In conventional two-strokes, a portion of the fuel/air mixture entering the cylinder from the crankcase through the intake ports goes directly out, unburned, through the exhaust port. With direct injection, only air (and usually some oil) comes from the crankcase, and fuel is not injected until the <b>piston</b> <b>rises</b> and all ports are closed.|$|R
50|$|An inline three-cylinder engine with 180° {{crankshaft}} can {{be found}} in early examples of the Laverda Jota motorcycle made by Italian manufacturer Laverda. In these engines, the outer <b>pistons</b> <b>rise</b> and fall together like a 360° straight-two engine. The inner cylinder is offset 180° from the outer cylinders. In these engines, cylinder number one fires, then 180° later cylinder number two fires, and then 180° later cylinder number three fires. There is no power stroke on the final 180° of rotation. This unusual crank angle came to be due to lack of proper tooling at the factory, which also made vertical twin engines that utilized a 180° crankshaft. After 1982, this engine had the regular 120° crank angle.|$|R
50|$|The flow of {{air through}} the venturi creates a reduced static {{pressure}} in the venturi. This pressure drop is communicated to the upper side of the piston via an air passage. The underside of the piston is open to atmospheric pressure. The difference in pressure {{between the two sides}} of the piston lifts the piston. Opposing this are the weight of the piston and the force of a spring that is compressed by the <b>piston</b> <b>rising.</b> Because the spring is operating over a very small part of its possible range of extension, its force is approximately constant. Under steady state conditions the upwards and downwards forces on the piston are equal and opposite, and the piston does not move.|$|R
50|$|Diesel engines, unlike {{gasoline}} engines, {{do not use}} {{spark plugs}} to induce combustion. Instead, they rely solely on compression to raise {{the temperature of the}} air to a point where the diesel combusts spontaneously when introduced to the hot high pressure air. The high pressure and spray pattern of the diesel ensures a controlled, complete burn. The <b>piston</b> <b>rises,</b> compressing the air in the cylinder; this causes the air's temperature to rise. By the time the piston reaches the top of its travel path, the temperature in the cylinder is very high. The fuel mist is then sprayed into the cylinder; it instantly combusts, forcing the piston downwards, thus generating power. The pressure required to heat the air to that temperature, however, requires a large and strong engine block.|$|R
50|$|Reed valves are {{commonly}} used in high-performance versions of the two-stroke engine, where they control the fuel-air mixture admitted to the cylinder. As the <b>piston</b> <b>rises</b> in the cylinder a vacuum is created in the crankcase beneath the piston. The resulting pressure differential opens the valve and the fuel-air mixture flows into the crankcase. As the piston descends, it raises the crankcase pressure causing the valve to close to retain the mixture and pressurize it for its eventual transfer through to the combustion chamber. The Swedish motorcycle company Husqvarna produced a two-stroke, 500 cc displacement single cylinder engine with a reed-valve controlled intake, {{one of the biggest}} in using this arrangement. Reed valves in two-stroke engines have been placed in the intake ports and also in controlling the intake to the crankshaft space.|$|R
5000|$|If the airflow {{into the}} engine is {{increased}} - by opening the throttle plate, or by allowing the engine revolutions to rise with the throttle plate at a constant setting - the pressure drop in the venturi increases, the pressure above the piston falls, and the piston is sucked upwards, increasing {{the size of the}} venturi, until the pressure drop in the venturi returns to its nominal level. Similarly if the airflow into {{the engine is}} reduced, the piston will fall. The result is that the pressure drop in the venturi remains the same regardless of the speed of the airflow - hence the name [...] "constant depression" [...] for carburettors operating on this principle - but the <b>piston</b> <b>rises</b> and falls according to the speed of the airflow.|$|R
5000|$|The TX750 was a Yamaha {{motorcycle}} made in 1973 and 1974. It was {{loosely based}} on the XS650 but had what Yamaha called an [...] "Omni-Phase balancer" [...] to counter vibrations which are inherent in a parallel twin with the crankshaft set at 360 degrees (both <b>pistons</b> <b>rise</b> at the same time). Using a pair of balancers (one to stabilize the imbalance of the cylinders, the other to counter the rocking caused by the first balancer), Yamaha’s Omni-Phase balancer essentially eliminated vibration in the TX750, producing a smooth ride previously thought possible only in a triple or a four cylinder. This new system was a first for a motorcycle but resulted in massive failures for the first model year. Although, these problems were fixed in 1974 sales never picked up and the machine was shelved.|$|R
5000|$|Dry-seal gas holders have {{a static}} {{cylindrical}} shell, within which a <b>piston</b> <b>rises</b> and falls. As it moves, a grease seal, tar/oil seal or a sealing membrane which is rolled out and {{in from the}} piston keeps the gas from escaping. The MAN (Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Nürnberg AG) was introduced in 1915: it was polygonal and used a tar/oil seal. The Klonne dry seal gas holder was circular: it used a grease seal. The Dry-seal Wiggins gas holder was patented in 1952: it used a flexible curtain that was suspended from the piston. [...] The largest low-pressure gas holders built was the Klonne gas holder built in 1938 in Gelsenkirchen. It was 136 m high and 80 m in diameter, which gave it a capacity of [...] There was a MAN type, built in 1934 in Chicago with a capacity of [...]|$|R
5000|$|If the airflow {{into the}} engine is {{increased}} - by opening the throttle plate (usually {{referred to as the}} [...] "butterfly"), or by allowing the engine revs to rise with the throttle plate at a constant setting - the pressure drop in the venturi increases, the pressure above the piston falls, and the piston is sucked upwards, increasing the size of the venturi, until the pressure drop in the venturi returns to its nominal level.

50|$|From an army manual on {{pile driving}} hammers:The initial start {{up of the}} hammer {{requires}} the piston (ram) to be raised {{to a point where}} the trip automatically releases the piston, allowing it to fall by gravity. As the piston falls, it activates the fuel pump, which discharges a metered amount of fuel into the ball pan of the impact block. The falling piston also blocks the exhaust ports, and compression of fuel trapped in the cylinder begins. The compressed air exerts a pre-load force to hold the impact block firmly against the drive cap and pile. At the bottom of the compression stroke, the piston strikes the impact block, atomizing the fuel and starting the pile on its downward movement. In the instant after the piston strikes, the atomized fuel ignites, and the resulting explosion exerts an even greater force on the already moving pile, driving it further into the ground. The reaction of the explosion rebounding from the resistance of the pile drives the piston upward. As the <b>piston</b> <b>rises,</b> the exhaust ports open, releasing the gases and force of the explosion into the atmosphere. After the piston stops its upward movement, it again falls by gravity to start another cycle.|$|R
