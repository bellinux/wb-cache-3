40|$|Calculation of {{efficiency}} of <b>reversible</b> <b>cycles</b> in thermodynamics remains a controversial issue. The basic question is this: Do different reversible heat engines, operating between maximum and minimum temperatures TH and TL, respectively, have different values {{of efficiency}}?

In other words, no two <b>reversible</b> <b>cycles</b> operating between maximum and minimum temperatures of TH and TL respectively, can have unequal efficiencies...|$|R
40|$|Biochemical {{reactions}} are fundamentally noisy at a molecular scale. This limits {{the precision of}} reaction networks, but also allows fluctuation measurements which may reveal the structure and dynamics of the underlying biochemical network. Here, we study non-equilibrium reaction cycles, such as the mechanochemical cycle of molecular motors, the phosphorylation cycle of circadian clock proteins, or the transition state cycle of enzymes. Fluctuations in such cycles may be measured using either of two classical definitions of the randomness parameter, which we show to be equivalent in general microscopically <b>reversible</b> <b>cycles.</b> We define a stochastic period for <b>reversible</b> <b>cycles</b> and present analytical solutions for its moments. Furthermore, we associate the two forms of the randomness parameter with the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, which sets limits on the timing precision of the cycle in terms of thermodynamic quantities.

5000|$|In thermodynamics, a {{reversible}} {{process is a}} process whose direction can be [...] "reversed" [...] by inducing infinitesimal changes to some property of the system via its surroundings, while not increasing entropy. Throughout the entire {{reversible process}}, the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium with its surroundings. Since it would take an infinite amount of time for the reversible process to finish, perfectly reversible processes are impossible. However, if the system undergoing the changes responds much faster than the applied change, the deviation from reversibility may be negligible. In a <b>reversible</b> <b>cycle,</b> a reversible process which is cyclic, the system and its surroundings {{will be returned to}} their original states if the forward cycle is followed by the reverse cycle.|$|E
50|$|Since the Carnot {{cycle is}} a <b>reversible</b> <b>cycle,</b> the four {{processes}} that comprise it, two isothermal and two isentropic, {{can all be}} reversed as well. When this happens, it is called a reversed Carnot cycle. A refrigerator or heat pump that acts on the reversed Carnot cycle is called a Carnot refrigerator and Carnot heat pump respectively. In {{the first stage of}} this cycle (process 1-2), the refrigerant absorbs heat isothermally from a low-temperature source, TL, in the amount QL. Next, the refrigerant is isentropically compressed (process 2-3) and the temperature rises to the high-temperature source, TH. Then at this high temperature, the refrigerant rejects heat isothermally in the amount QH (process 3-4). Also during this stage, the refrigerant changes from a saturated vapor to a saturated liquid in the condenser. Lastly, the refrigerant expands isentropically where the temperature drops back to the low-temperature source, TL (process 4-1).|$|E

Aluminium (alane, AlH{sub 3 }) hydride has been examined as a potential hydrogen storage material because of its high weight capacity, low discharge temperature, and volumetric density.

Since one of the requirements of the cyclic network model of the AATM is that the Haldane ratio should always be close to 1 (Helgerson and Carruthers 1987; Krupka 1989), the alteration in the ratio by the T 295 M mutation and several others (Wong et al. 2007) shows that the simple view that glucose transport kinetics can be adequately described {{on the basis of a}} single <b>reversible</b> <b>cycle</b> is inconsistent with the kinetic data as well as the thermodynamics.|$|E
