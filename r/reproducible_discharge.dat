40|$|AbstractThe {{generation}} of multi-material components by {{laser beam melting}} (LBM) is a challenge which requires the invention of new coating devices for preparation of arbitrary powder patterns. One solution is the usage of vibration-controlled nozzles for selective deposition of polymer powders. Powder flow can be initiated by vibration enabling a start-stop function without using any mechanical shutter. In this report, the delivery of polymer powder by vibrating nozzles is investigated {{with respect to their}} application in LBM machines. Therefore, a steel nozzle attached to a piezo actor and a weighing cell is used in order to measure the stability and time-dependence of the powder mass flow upon vibration excitation with the usage of different kind of powder formulations. The results show that precompression of the powder inside the nozzle by vibration excitation is essential to realize a reliable start-stop function with <b>reproducible</b> <b>discharge</b> cyles and to prevent a initial flush of powder flow. Moreover, the use of different powder materials showed that mass flow is even possible with powders which are not optimized regarding flowability, but is readily enhanced with a factor of 2 to 3 by admixing Aerosil® fumed silica...|$|E
40|$|Laser initiated, free {{standing}} discharge channels offer many attractive advantages for the transport and focusing of intense ion beams [1, 2]. Discharge plasmas can neutralize both current and space charge of such beams, while the {{azimuthal magnetic field}} provides strong focusing {{all the way through}} the channel. Experiments at GSI have produced 50 cm long stable plasma channels with peak currents in excess of 40 kA in 2 to 20 mbar NH 3 gas fill. The discharges are initiated by a CO 2 laser pulse, fired into the chamber along the chamber axis. Absorption of the laser causes strong gas heating. Subsequent expansion and rarefaction of the gas prepare the right conditions for a stable, <b>reproducible</b> <b>discharge,</b> suitable for ion beam transport. First experiments to study the ion optical properties of such channels were already reported in [3, 4]. During the last year the channel stability was considerably improved by a newCO 2 laser with an option for wavelength tuning. The wavelength can be adjusted to the P(32) transition for peak absorption, matching the ν = 950 cm− 1 vibrational mode in NH 3 [5]. In this way a large fraction of the laser energy is absorbed as the beam passes through the 50 cm long gas filled chamber, down to pressures of a fewmbar (figure 1). absorbed energy [%...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{presentation}} of the most relevant recent Physics results obtained in the TJ-II flexible heliac. Firstly ECRH modulation and plasma breakdown studies are summarised; then the particle control techniques used to obtain <b>reproducible</b> <b>discharges</b> with density under control are presented. Transport studies show internal heat transport barriers that reduce heat conductivity to neoclassical values, and ELM-like transport events, similar to those observed in tokamaks and in other stellarators before and during H mode transition. Evidence of ExB sheared has been observed both in the proximity of rational surfaces. Finally, a high resolution Thomsom Scattering system has shown Te and ne profile structures...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. 13 CH 4 was {{injected}} through graphite and tungsten spherical limiters in <b>reproducible</b> TEXTOR <b>discharges.</b> These {{materials were}} chosen, as {{they represent the}} actual compromise for the plasma facing components in the ITER divertor. 13 C was used in order to distinguish injected and intrinsic carbon in the layer deposited on the limiter surface. Shot-by-shot video recordings show a continuous growth of the deposit near the injection hole. A pronounced difference in the 13 C deposition pattern on the graphite and tungsten limiters was observed. Post-mortem surface analysis showed that the ratios of the locally deposited to the injected amount of carbon are 4 % for graphite and 0. 3 % for tungsten. The margins of the carbon layer deposited on tungsten are significantly steeper {{in comparison to the}} graphite limiter case. The large difference in the 13 C deposition efficiency can be explained by direct reflection of carbon from tungsten and enhanced sputtering of carbon on tungsten substrate. Nucleation is suggested to be an important mechanism for carbon deposition on tungsten. Monte Carlo impurity transport calculations by the ERO code reproduce reasonably the experimental results for the graphite limiter...|$|R
40|$|A ‘‘reference cell’’ for {{generating}} radio‐frequency (rf) glow discharges in gases at a frequency of 13. 56 MHz is described. The reference cell provides an experimental platform for comparing plasma measurements {{carried out in}} a common reactor geometry by different experimental groups, thereby enhancing the transfer of knowledge and insight gained in rf discharge studies. The results of performing ostensibly identical measurements on six of these cells in five different laboratories are analyzed and discussed. Measurements were made of plasma voltage and current characteristics for discharges in pure argon at specified values of applied voltages, gas pressures, and gas flow rates. Data are presented on relevant electrical quantities derived from Fourier analysis of the voltage and current wave forms. Amplitudes, phase shifts, self‐bias voltages, and power dissipation were measured. Each of the cells was characterized {{in terms of its}} measured internal reactive components. Comparing results from different cells provides an indication of the degree of precision needed to define the electrical configuration and operating parameters in order to achieve identical performance at various laboratories. The results show, for example, that the external circuit, including the reactive components of the rf power source, can significantly influence the discharge. Results obtained in reference cells with identical rf power sources demonstrate that considerable {{progress has been made in}} developing a phenomenological understanding of the conditions needed to obtain <b>reproducible</b> <b>discharge</b> conditions in independent reference cells...|$|E
40|$|A {{critical}} issue in inertial confinement fusion driven by heavy ions is {{the transport of}} the ion beams through a reactor chamber. In all plant scenarios the reactor has radii of about 3 - 5 m and in some it is envisaged to incorporate a background gas fill to reduce the x-ray damage to the first wall. An ion beam propagating in such environment will not meet the geometrical and temporal parameters required at the target position because of scattering and stripping in the background gas. Therefore gas density reduction and neutralization of the ion beam space charge and electrical current are necessary to successfully achieve ignition of the fuel pellet. A promising technique uses high current discharge channels to transport the heavy ion beam to the target. The aims of the experiments presented in this work {{are related to the}} study of initiation and generation of long and stable discharge channels and the examination of their ion optical properties. To fulfill the above issues a cylindrical metallic chamber has been integrated into the Z 4 ion beam line of the GSI-UNILAC accelerator. With the help of a tunable CO 2 laser a 0. 5 m long path in low-pressure ammonia gas is heated by resonant absorption. Because of the subsequent gas expansion a rarefaction channel with preferential breakdown conditions is created along the discharge chamber axis. Dumping of the energy stored in a capacitor bank into the gas produces a straight plasma channel along the laser path. An additional, independent low current discharge before the ignition of the main discharge has proven to be beneficial for the stability of the plasma column, especially at high pressures and currents. Streak, framing and fast shutter cameras were used to study the hydrodynamics of the discharge channel. These experiments proved that stable and <b>reproducible</b> <b>discharge</b> channels could be produced up to times longer than the first half period of the current waveform. A special dB/dt probe containing 8 collinear coils has been designed and constructed for measuring the induced azimuthal magnetic field. Magnetic field values at the channel edge of 1 T and field gradients inside the channels of more then 300 T/m corresponding to a uniform radial current distribution could be measured. During several beamtimes, different ion beam species have been used to probe the ion optical properties of the channel. Within the limits set by the experimental conditions (channel length and diameter, and discharge current) one full betatron oscillation could be observed. This result agrees with simulations based on magnetic probe measurements. For the first time an alternative technique that uses an ion beam to initiate and guide a long discharge was tested. Straight and stable discharge channels could be generated in noble or molecular gases. The advantages of this technique are the reduced channel axial jitter compared to laser initiation and the free choice of the discharge gas...|$|E
40|$|Although {{caffeine}} {{has long}} been {{considered to be a}} cerebral cortical stimulant, relatively little is known of its sites and mechanism of action in the cerebral cortex. Therefore, the effects of the methylated xanthines, caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine have been studied on the evoked electrical afterdischarge of the neuronally isolated cerebral cortex preparation of dogs. Electrical stimulation of the neuronally isolated island of suprasylvian gyrus with an intact pial circulation in postanesthetized and immobilized dog preparations elicited a characteristic <b>reproducible</b> spikelike <b>discharge</b> limited within the island. The duration of such afterdischarge was measured before and after the administration of various drugs. Among the methylated xanthines, caffeine in doses as low as 0. 25 mg/kg was the most potent in prolonging cortical afterdischarge. Theophylline and theobromine appeared much less potent. The dose-effect relationship with different doses of the methylated xanthines was determined. It was found that large doses of theophylline and theobromine clearly reduced the duration of cortical afterdischarge. Repeated administration of caffeine appeared to cause no further or even less prolongation of afterdischarge than that produced by the first dose suggesting that tachyphylaxis occurred...|$|R
40|$|Wall {{conditioning}} in DIII-D {{is one of}} {{the most}} important factors in achieving <b>reproducible</b> high confinement <b>discharges.</b> For example, the very high confinement mode (VH-mode) was only discovered after boronization, a CVD technique to deposit a thin boron film over the entire surface of the tokamak. In order to evaluate wall conditions and provide a data base to correlate these wall conditions with tokamak discharge performance, a series of nominally identical reference VH-mode discharges (1. 6 MA, 2. 1 T, double-null diverted) were taken at various times during a series of experimental campaigns with evolving wall conditions. These reference discharges have allowed a quantitative determination of how the wall conditions have evolved. For instance, core carbon and oxygen levels in the VH-mode phase remains at historically low levels during the 1995 run year and there was also a steady decrease in the oxygen levels at plasma initiation during this period. The authors discuss the long term changes in low Z impurities and the effect of wall conditioning techniques such as boronization and baking on these impurities. In addition, the evolution of the deuterium recycling rates will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|All-solid-state {{batteries}} {{including a}} garnet ceramic as electrolyte are potential candidates {{to replace the}} currently used Li-ion technology, as they offer safer operation and higher energy storage performances. However, the development of ceramic electrolyte batteries faces several challenges at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces, which need to withstand high current densities to enable competing C-rates. In this work, we investigate {{the limits of the}} anode/electrolyte interface in a full cell that includes a Li-metal anode, LiFePO 4 cathode, and garnet ceramic electrolyte. The addition of a liquid interfacial layer between the cathode and the ceramic electrolyte is found to be a prerequisite to achieve low interfacial resistance and to enable full use of the active material contained in the porous electrode. <b>Reproducible</b> and constant <b>discharge</b> capacities are extracted from the cathode active material during the first 20 cycles, revealing high efficiency of the garnet as electrolyte and the interfaces, but prolonged cycling leads to abrupt cell failure. By using a combination of structural and chemical characterization techniques, such as SEM and solid-state NMR, as well as electrochemical and impedance spectroscopy, it is demonstrated that a sudden impedance drop occurs in the cell due to the formation of metallic Li and its propagation within the ceramic electrolyte. This degradation process is originated at the interface between the Li-metal anode and the ceramic electrolyte layer and leads to electromechanical failure and cell short-circuit. Improvement of the performances is observed when cycling the full cell at 55 °C, as the Li-metal softening favors the interfacial contact. Various degradation mechanisms are proposed to explain this behavior...|$|R
40|$|Spectra of the 011 ion were {{obtained}} with {{temporal and spatial}} (along the poloidal radius) resolution by injecting of oxygen-containing molecules through a block of the upper poloidal limiter of TEXTOR- 94 into the boundary plasma. Three different wavelength regions (4660 +/- 100, 4340 +/- 100, 3730 +/- 100 Angstrom) were observed during <b>reproducible</b> TEXTOR- 94 <b>discharges</b> with n(e) = 1 x 10 (18) m(- 3), T-e = 90 eV at the last closed flux surface (LCFS). For calibration purposes the oxygen emission was simultaneously registered in all discharges with a 2 D camera using the light from an O 11 line at 4416 Angstrom. Radial intensity distributions of lines corresponding to the transitions 2 p(2) [P- 3] 3 s- 2 p(2) [3 P] 3 p (components of the multiplets P- 4 -S- 4, P- 4 -P- 4 P- 4 -D- 4, P- 2 -D- 2 and 2 p(2) [D- 1] 3 s- 2 p(2) [D- 1] 3 p (doublet D- 2 -D- 2) were measured. It is shown that the relative intensities of the lines inside the multiplets are in good agreement with theoretical data calculated in SL-coupling. An appropriate collisional-radiative model (the level list and the corresponding atomic database) has been developed and calculations {{have been carried out}} using the GKU kinetic code developed at the P. N. Lebedev Institute. Cross-sections of atomic processes have been calculated using the ATOM code by the K-matrix method. A comparison of theoretical and experimental data is presented.
