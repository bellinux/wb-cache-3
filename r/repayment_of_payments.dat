Private sector creditors and the IFI offer different debt contracts that are modelled based on the institutional frameworks of these two types of debt. We analyze the decisions of a sovereign on how to allocate its borrowing needs between these two types of creditors, and when to default on its debt to the private sector creditor. The numerical analysis shows that, consistent with the data; the model predicts countercyclical IFI debt along with procyclical commercial debt flows, also matching other features of the data such as frequency of IFI borrowing and mean IFI debt stock.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{analyzes}} {{the advantages and}} disadvantages of establishing a debt fund on the <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> student loan. Based on these analyses, on one hand, we discuss the mode <b>of</b> equal fraction <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> the total amount of the loan principal and its interest in each term. This mode yields great flexibility in that the repayment fund can have a greater interest rate to enhance the will of the lender to save money in the fund and thus can promote the early repayment. Banks can therefore regulate and control the situation and reduce the rate of contract breaking in loan repayment. Moreover, this mode can work well with the current policy and then can have excellent operability; On the other hand, theoretical analysis and example also shows that if the repayment amounts form a reasonable geometric increasing sequence, the repayment can be even more optimal in that it not only has the advantages of the foregoing mode, but also has the advantage of selecting the increasing rate <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> to adjust the burdens in each period <b>of</b> the <b>repayment</b> and make each period repayment burden relatively equal.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the patterns <b>of</b> early <b>repayment</b> in multi-period credit transactions. Considered {{one of the}} most common ways of conversion of unpaid interest for early repayment, so-called 78 rule. The relationship of this rule with the linear approximation of the exact value; redeemable debt is determined. The analysis of the maximum excess <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> interest on 78 rule. It has been shown how interest payment on 78 rule depended on the time <b>of</b> early <b>repayment.</b> Early <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> debt is an agreement under which the borrower pays to the lender amount of money equal to the current balance (as of loan account). Then further regular payments cease and the contract terminates. However, the amount of outstanding debt is determined by the structure of prescription charges. So in the uniform schemes <b>of</b> <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> consumer credit each payment contains the same part of principal amounts and the total interest. In case <b>of</b> early <b>repayment</b> the Bank loses a significant fraction of the expected interest payments. Therefore, in practice, often used so-called accelerated schemes <b>of</b> interest <b>payments.</b> One <b>of</b> them is 78 rule. Use the 78 rule is simple and straightforward. The name of the rule is due to the fact that the sum of the numbers 12 monthly payments is 78. In the schemes of consumer loan with a term of one year interest payment for the current month is equal to m/ 78 of the total amount <b>of</b> interest <b>payments,</b> where m is the number <b>of</b> remaining <b>payments.</b> The rule name is stored and in the more general case with an arbitrary number <b>of</b> <b>payments.</b> In general interest payment is determined by the relative weight of the total amount of interest in each payment. In uniform schemes it is constant. In accelerated with a particular speed decreases. Therefore, additional cash expenses by the 78 rule may be considered as additional penalties for early <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> the debt. It this article is shown how this penalty depends on time before maturity. It is shown that the magnitude of these penalties in monetary terms reaches the maximum value when the loan is repaid early between half and two thirds of the total of the loan term...|$|R
50|$|The amount <b>of</b> {{the monthly}} <b>payment</b> {{at the end}} of month N that is applied to {{principal}} paydown equals the amount c <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> minus the amount of interest currently paid on the pre-existing unpaid principal. The latter amount, the interest component <b>of</b> the current <b>payment,</b> is the interest rate r times the amount unpaid {{at the end of}} month N-1. Since {{in the early years of}} the mortgage the unpaid principal is still large, so are the interest payments on it; so the portion <b>of</b> the monthly <b>payment</b> going toward paying down the principal is very small and equity in the property accumulates very slowly (in the absence of changes in the market value of the property). But in the later years of the mortgage, when the principal has already been substantially paid down and not much monthly interest needs to be paid, most <b>of</b> the monthly <b>payment</b> goes toward <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> the principal, and the remaining principal declines rapidly.|$|R
