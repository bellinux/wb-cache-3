40|$|Abstract: <b>Water</b> <b>resources</b> <b>accounting</b> {{was defined}} by the <b>Water</b> <b>Accounting</b> Development Committee (2007) as “the {{application}} of a consistent and structured approach to identifying, measuring, recording and reporting information about water. ” Discussion of the desired outcomes of <b>water</b> <b>accounting</b> {{makes it clear that}} there is focus on water extraction and consumptive use for domestic, economic or public benefits. This aspect of <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> <b>accounting</b> is described here as <b>water</b> use <b>accounting.</b> <b>Water</b> use is not always assessed efficiently or accurately by holistic consideration of the entire water balance. For example, urban water systems may represent a relatively small component of a regional water balance, but an intensively and accurately metered one. In such cases, <b>water</b> use <b>accounting</b> may be a well posed problem that only requires appropriate aggregation and reporting of metering data. In rural systems, extractions of groundwater and river water and the water use associated with runoff intercepting activities are often only partially metered or not metered at all. However, they are often within the uncertainty ranges of common hydrological water balance measurements and models, and therefore cannot always be inferred from those. There is a need for purpose-designed water use metering and estimation strategies that address statistical issues such as sampling design and uncertainty estimation. In this paper, we discuss the statistical challenges associated with the <b>water</b> use <b>accounting</b> and assessment...|$|R

40|$|The {{scarcity}} of water encourages scientists to develop new analytical tools to enhance <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> management. <b>Water</b> <b>accounting</b> and distributed hydrological models are examples of such tools. <b>Water</b> <b>accounting</b> needs accurate input data for adequate descriptions of water distribution and water depletion in river basins. Ground-based observatories are decreasing, and not generally accessible. Remote sensing data is a suitable alternative to measure the required input variables. This paper reviews the reliability of remote sensing algorithms to accurately determine the spatial distribution of actual evapotranspiration, rainfall and land use. For our validation we used only those papers that covered study periods of seasonal to annual cycles because the accumulated water balance is the primary concern. Review papers covering shorter periods only (days, weeks) {{were not included in}} our review. Our review shows that by using remote sensing, the absolute values of evapotranspiration can be estimated with an overall accuracy of 95 % (SD 5 %) and rainfall with an overall absolute accuracy of 82 % (SD 15 %). Land use can be identified with an overall accuracy of 85 % (SD 7 %). Hence, more scientific work is needed to improve the spatial mapping of rainfall and land use using multiple space-borne sensors.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{concepts of}} <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> development and utilization have caused serious hydrological {{and environmental issues}} in some regions. In addition, policy issues in China {{have led to a}} severe water crisis. The quantitative <b>accounting</b> of <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> is a theoretical approach to solving these problems. In this paper, 13 indicators were selected from four classes, including resources, the environment, society, and efficiency, and a case study of Jinan, Shandong Province, was performed using a set pair analysis model to calculate the <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> assets from 2011 – 2015. In previous methods of <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> <b>accounting,</b> the <b>water</b> quality was not considered; therefore, the loss coefficient of <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> assets was proposed to improve the reliability of accounting. According to the relationships among the unit price of water, water quantity, and water quality, physical and quantitative accounting methods were used to create water balance sheets from 2011 – 2015.

Efficient and effective water management is {{an important element in}} alleviating water crises caused by misuse of <b>water</b> <b>resources.</b> Key literature/theoretical perspective: The theoretical framework adopted is Accountability. This concept is explored in depth across three main ideas: power, the accountability relationship and transparency. Design/methodology/approach: The research method adopted in this paper is mixed method. A questionnaire was administered to users with water-related interests in five different water-related seminars yielding 36 usable responses.

Then we give a recapitulation of results of a recent survey carried out by the French IFEN (Institut Français pour l'Environnement) exploring perceptions of what are the key categories of ‘natural capital' — and their criticalness — for the French society and economy. A review is made of the availability of fundamental categories of ‘natural resources' in the French economy, notably energy sources, forest assets, agricultural soils and <b>water</b> <b>resources,</b> and air quality. Finally we focus on natural capital as a life support infrastructure vulnerable to breakdown or contamination. Topical examples show environmental degradation due to pollution, accidents and the production of wastes, as being both serious and widespread. Ecosystem contamination is closely associated with defilement of food — dioxin in chickens, mistrust of GMOs in agriculture and food, and the vache folle — mad cow disease...|$|R

Underpinning water management is the basic information on the availability and use of <b>water</b> <b>resources.</b> However, reliable information about <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> is hard to obtain for several reasons, one of which is availability of data. Even where data are available the task of identifying who uses how much water remains difficult because of hydrologic complexities of water use, storage and water reuse, especially in heavily developed river basins. The objective of the chapter is to introduce the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) <b>Water</b> <b>Accounting</b> Framework (IWMI WA), developed in 1997, and recent developments related to this <b>water</b> <b>accounting</b> system. IWMI WA provides information on supply and use of water and relates water use to the economy. It is a multiscale method to account for the amount of water available, how much is used by various sectors and the value derived from the use to promote understanding of water use and assist with improved water management. In illustrating the IWMI WA system, concepts and definitions plus examples from different areas and scales are discussed in this chapter. In a basin context, <b>water</b> <b>accounting</b> defines <b>water</b> availability and helps users to understand water use and benefits and costs derived from its use...|$|R

The Research has suggested a paradigm for a comprehensive management framework for large-scale water management problems in arid and semi-arid areas. This management framework can help to achieve sustainable <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> for meeting <b>water</b> demand and preventing the gridlock and excessive legal expense of uncoordinated and conflict-filled decisio...|$|R

40|$|The {{management}} and balancing of social, {{environmental and economic}} sustainability {{is one of the}} most complex and urgent challenges facing both private and public sector organizations today; with these challenges of sustainability posing many risks to, but also providing many opportunities for, advancing the aims and performance of organizations. Accounting and accountability processes and practices provide key tools to help organizations more effectively identify and manage the risks and opportunities from sustainability. This new edition of Sustainability Accounting and Accountability updates the insights on these issues from the first edition, incorporating the rapid developments in both theory and practice since the first edition was published. Whilst the popular features from the first edition will be retained, several chapters are combined, condensed and reorganized and new substantive chapters are introduced on <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> <b>accounting,</b> carbon accounting, and decision making. With contributions from a global cast of experts, the book will continue to be a key resource for lecturers and students on the increasing number of university courses delivered in many counties that focus on these issues, as well as being a key resource for researchers...|$|R
