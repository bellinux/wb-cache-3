50|$|Some Lombard polenta {{dishes are}} polenta taragna (which {{includes}} buckwheat flour), polenta uncia, polenta concia, polenta e gorgonzola, and missultin e polenta—all are cooked with various cheeses and butter, except missultin e polenta, which is cooked with fish from Lake Como. In {{some areas of}} the Veneto region, it can also be made from white cornmeal (mais biancoperla, once called polenta bianca). In some areas of Piedmont in the northwest, it can also be made from potatoes instead of cornmeal. In the westernmost alpine region, the maize is sometimes combined with local grains like barley and rye (polente bâtarde or polente barbare), and often frichâ, and toasted on a loza (thin <b>refractory</b> <b>stone).</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{recovery}} of vanadium from a typical low-grade <b>refractory</b> <b>stone</b> coal was investigated using a pyro-hydrometallurgical process specifically including blank roasting, acid leaching, solvent extraction, and chemical precipitation. The appropriate role of parameters in each process was analyzed in detail. Roasting temperature and roasting {{time during the}} roasting process showed {{a significant effect on}} leaching efficiency of vanadium. Using H 2 SO 4 as a leaching agent, vanadium leaching efficiency can achieve above 90 % under the optimum leaching conditions of CaF 2 dosage of 5 %, sulfuric acid concentration of 4 mol/L, liquid to solid ratio of 2 : 1 mL/g, leaching time of 2 h, and leaching temperature of 95 °C. 99. 10 % of vanadium can be extracted from the leaching solution in three stages under the conditions of initial pH of 1. 6, trioctylamine (TOA) extractant concentration of 20 % (vol), phase ratio (A/O) of 2, and reaction time of 2 min. 1. 0 mol/L NaOH was used to strip vanadium from the extracted solvent phase. After purification and precipitation, vanadium can be crystallized as ammonium metavanadate. The V 2 O 5 product with a purity of 99. 75 % is obtained after ammonium metavanadate thermal decomposition at 550 °C for 2 h. The total vanadium recovery in the whole process is above 88 %. This process has advantages of short operation time, high vanadium extraction efficiency, and high purity of the product...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA 58 -year-old woman {{presented}} with a 4 cm obstructing choledocolith within the proximal common bile duct. She had an extensive operative history resulting in common bile duct to jejunum anastomosis after cholecystectomy. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) removal was unsuccessful, and surgical exploration was contraindicated due to multiple comorbidities. Interventional radiologist placement of bilateral transhepatic ureteral access sheaths allowed Urologist evaluation of the biliary tract by ureteroscope. Holmium laser lithotripsy was performed with successful fragmentation of the stone and clearance of the obstruction, without complication. The case is relevant to the growing literature on the management of <b>refractory</b> biliary <b>stones</b> after failed ERCP...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To report our {{outcomes}} {{with small}} diameter, actively deflectable flexible ureterorenoscopy from a prospective database. PATIENTS and METHODS: 114 flexible ureterorenoscopies were performed in 105 patients (mean age, 49. 5 years; range, 19 - 85 years; 71 males, 34 females) over a 9 -month period. Of these, 101 were for <b>refractory</b> <b>stones</b> following failed ESWL and 13 for diagnostic reasons. An Olympus URF P 3 flexible ureteroscope with pressure irrigation was used. Electrohydraulic lithotripsy {{was used to}} fragment stones and the fragments were retrieved with Graspit, triradiate graspers or tipless baskets. RESULTS: Stents had previously been placed in 53 % and dilatation of the ureteric orifice was necessary in 15 %. In the stone group, the median operating time was 55 min (range, 15 - 210 min) and the median screening time 2. 2 min (range, 0. 3 - 9. 1 min). Success was defined as complete stone clearance or good fragmentation to 2 mm or less. Overall success in this group was 72. 3 %. There was {{no statistically significant difference}} between lower and other calyces (P= 0. 83 Chi-square test). Successful outcome was achieved in 72 % for stone size 10 mm or less, 80 % for 11 - 20 mm and 50 % for greater than 20 mm. Two or more procedures were needed in 8 patients. In the diagnostic group, the median operating time was 45 min (range, 20 - 60 min) and the median screening time 2 min (range, 0. 3 - 8. 3 min). The majority were for upper tract filling defects. Access and successful diagnosis was achieved in all cases. The major complication rate was 2. 6 %. The ureteroscope needed repair once during this series. CONCLUSIONS: Flexible ureterorenoscopy is an effective diagnostic and therapeutic tool in a select group of patients. It should be considered for ESWL-resistant upper tract stones but the results are poor in stones larger than 20 mm and percutaneous nephrolithotomy may be a better option in these patients...|$|R
60|$|There {{was a pause}} while Clutton with {{voracious}} appetite devoured {{the food}} that was set before him. Philip, smoking a cheap cigar, observed him closely. The ruggedness of the head, which {{looked as though it}} were carved from a <b>stone</b> <b>refractory</b> to the sculptor's chisel, the rough mane of dark hair, the great nose, and the massive bones of the jaw, suggested a man of strength; and yet Philip wondered whether perhaps the mask concealed a strange weakness. Clutton's refusal to show his work might be sheer vanity: he could not bear the thought of anyone's criticism, and he would not expose himself to the chance of a refusal from the Salon; he wanted to be received as a master and would not risk comparisons with other work which might force him to diminish his own opinion of himself. During the eighteen months Philip had known him Clutton had grown more harsh and bitter; though he would not come out into the open and compete with his fellows, he was indignant with the facile success of those who did. He had no patience with Lawson, and the pair were no longer on the intimate terms upon which they had been when Philip first knew them.|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} {{extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy}} (ESWL) for the management of refractory bile duct cholelithiasis in a third level referral centre. METHODS: The clinical records of all patients treated with a second generation electromagnetic lithotripter (Lithostar Plus, SIEMENS) from October 1990 to April 2005 were evaluated. All patients were monitored during the procedure and antibiotics were administered in case of cholangitis. The χ 2 test and logistic regression analysis were performed as appropriate. RESULTS: Two hundred and fourteen patients (102 males, 112 females; mean age 74. 8 ± 0. 84 years - single stone 97, multiple stones 117) underwent ESWL. The mean number of sessions and shock waves were 3. 5 ± 0. 13 and 3477. 06 ± 66. 17, respectively. The maximum stone size was 5 cm. Complete stone clearance was achieved in 192 (89. 7 %) patients. Of the remaining patients 15 required surgery, 2 a palliative stent and in 5 patients stone fragmentation led to effective bile drainage with clinical resolution despite incomplete clearance. Age, sex and stone characteristics were not related to treatment outcome. Major complications occurred in two patients (haemobilia and rectal bleeding) and minor complications in 25 (3 vomiting, 22 arrhythmias). No procedure-related deaths occurred. CONCLUSION: ESWL is a safe and effective technique for clearance of <b>refractory</b> bile duct <b>stones...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{introduction}} of minimally invasive surgical procedures has significantly reduced {{the rate of}} major salivary gland removal due to sialolithiasis. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the effectiveness of sialoendoscopy, rate of salivary fistula or natural ostium stenosis in parotid sialolithiasis treatment. The endpoint was to analyse the efficiency of a combined transcutaneous and endoscopic approach in the removal of <b>refractory</b> and impacted <b>stones</b> in most difficult cases. Study Design: prospective study, tertiary university centre, between XII 2008 and XI 2011, 185 sialendoscopies (SE) were performed in 162 patients. Within the group of 29 patients with parotid sialolithiasis endoscopy was the definite treatment in 15 cases (53 %), in 9 cases lithotripsy (ESWL) was necessary and in 5 patients who failed SE and lithotripsy, a combined approach was performed. This approach comprised both SE and open surgery. We observed no salivary fistula formation after the incision of the duct. Stenosis of the natural ostium thanks to the insertion of stent was observed only in one case. Sialoendoscopy is the method of choice with a high rate of success and gland preservation in small and medium stones. The combined transcutaneous and endoscopic approach is indicated for large stones, for complications after and contraindications in using minimally invasive procedures. Short and medium term follow up shows that surgery can be performed with a high rate of success...|$|R
40|$|Introduction—Laser {{lithotripsy}} of {{bile duct}} stones {{has become a}} widely accepted endoscopic treatment modality for giant, impacted, or very hard stones. The procedure is usually carried out under direct endoscopic control {{in view of the}} potential risk of bile duct injuries in "blind" laser application.  Aims—To investigate the use of a rhodamine 6 G laser lithotriptor with an integrated optical stone tissue detection system (oSTDS).  Methods—From 1 September 1991 to 7 March 1997, 60 patients with giant or impacted common bile duct <b>stones</b> <b>refractory</b> to endoscopic papillotomy stone extraction, and mechanical lithotripsy were treated via the endoscopic retrograde route using a rhodamine 6 G dye laser (595 nm, 2. 5 µs, 80 - 150 mJ pp, Lithognost Telemit/Baasel Corp., Germany) with integrated oSTDS. In case of tissue contact oSTDS cuts off the laser pulse after 190 ns (transmission of 5 - 8 % of the total pulse energy). 47 patients (78. 3 %) were subjected to x ray targeting (oSTDS) alone, five (8. 3 %) to choledochoscope targeting alone, and eight (13. 3 %) to both techniques.  Results—At the end of treatment 52 (87 %) patients were completely stone-free. The only major complications included transient haemobilia, cholangitis, and pancreatitis in five patients. All five were successfully treated by conservative methods.  Conclusions—Laser lithotripsy using the described rhodamine 6 G dye laser with oSTDS seems to be safe and effective and allows "blind" fragmentation of difficult common bile duct stones under radiological control only. ...|$|R
