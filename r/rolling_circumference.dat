40|$|Michelin {{develops}} and manufactures tires. To {{check their}} tire, different tires tests are used. During the testing process of agricultural tires, some endurance tests are performed on a circular test track where a convoy, {{made of a}} truck pulling two single-axle trailers without suspension system, is driven at a constant speed. Depending on the tested tires, {{it has been observed}} that the convoy may become severely instable. This instability is a large problem for the test team since the tires undertake too much overload which makes test results unexploitable. This is time consuming and expensive for the company. The aim of this thesis is two-folded. The first aim is to identify the phenomenon causing the instability from experimental data and also the parameters which influence the phenomenon. The second aim is to model the phenomenon from technical data in order to predict instability behaviors in advance. Models have been developed and the behavior have been analyzed and compared with experiments. The main result of this work is that the instable behavior is due to the excitation of natural modes of the convoy by the tires frequencies. Natural modes are identified as the natural bouncing mode of the trailers. The bouncing natural mode of a trailer depends on tires stiffnesses and the load on the trailer. Tires excitation frequencies are related to the test speed, the trailer track width and the <b>rolling</b> <b>circumference</b> of the tires. To get a good prediction tires stiffness and tires <b>rolling</b> <b>circumference</b> under operation require to be better characterized. Thanks to this work the test teams {{have a better understanding of}} the phenomenon and a tool which can be used to give a rough indication about problematic configurations. This tool cannot totally predict instable behaviors with the technical data at our disposal since some more parameters, which are not quantified for now, might influence the phenomenon. Nevertheless, these parameters have been highlighted by this study and if explored by the test team, a working predicting tool could be achieved...|$|E

A list of basic tire terms {{used to describe the}} tire profile is covered, along with performance criteria used to match mechanical front drive axles to the rear axle for proper gearing. In addition, the RCI table is introduced to provide a visual example of how tires can be grouped by <b>rolling</b> <b>circumference</b> and overall diameter. A description of tire size designations is listed for bias, radial, and flotation sizing. The load rating designations for ply, star, and load index is also explained. The five most common tread designs for powered axles are defined, with examples of the different patterns. Two examples of the creation of new tire sizes are given: one for large, high-horsepower, four-wheel drive tractors, and one for high-capacity row crop sprayers. Cyclical loads and their restrictions are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Morphological {{description}} of seeds is a required step {{for analysis of}} biodiversity in natural populations and may give clues to adaptive strategies in species evolution. A cardioid is the curve described by a point of one <b>circumference</b> <b>rolling</b> around another <b>circumference</b> of equal radius. Models based on adjustment of seed shape with cardioid curves have been described for Arabidopsis thaliana and the model legumes Lotus japonicus and Medicago truncatula. In this work the model is applied to analyze seed morphology in populations of two subspecies of Capparis spinosa growing in Tunisia. Adjustment of seed images to cardioid curves, followed by statistical analysis of similarity in the complete images {{as well as in}} each of four quadrants, allows an accurate {{description of}} seed shape. The results show differences in morphology between subspecies. Seeds of subsp. rupestris present higher diversity of shape than seeds of subsp. spinosa. This may indicate primitiveness of C. subsp. rupestris seeds, associated with nonspecialization. The results are discussed in relation to the ecological strategies of both subspecies in their evolution. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Analysis of seed shape in two subspecies of Capparis spinosa collected in Tunisia: Five populations of Subspecies Spinosa; five populations of Subspecies Rupestris. Morphological description of seeds is a required step {{for the analysis of}} biodiversity in natural populations and may give clues to understand adaptive strategies in evolution. The cardioid is the curve described by a point of one <b>circumference</b> <b>rolling</b> around another <b>circumference</b> of equal radius. Models based in the adjustment of seed shape with cardioid curves where described previously for Arabidopsis thaliana and the model legumes Lotus japonicus and Medicago truncatula. In this work the model is applied to the morphology of seeds in populations from two subspecies of Capparis spinosa grown in Tunisia. The adjustment of seed images to cardioid curves, followed by statistical analysis of similarity in the complete images as well as in each of four quadrants, allows an accurate description of seed shape. Results show differences in morphology between subspecies. Seeds from Capparis spinosa. subsp. rupestris present higher diversity in shape than seeds from populations of C. subsp. spinosa. This may indicate a primitive condition in the seeds of C. subsp. rupestris associated with non-specialization. The results are discussed in relation to ecological strategies of both subspecies in evolution.

2500|$|Louis Legrand Noble was {{a friend}} and biographer of Cole, and could have been {{expected}} to have some insight into the work. In his commentary, however, {{there is no mention of}} these ideas. He wrote, [...] "There [...] stands, rather reposes upon its shaft, a tower-like mossy structure, light as a bubble, and yet a section of a substantial globe. As the eye circles its wide <b>rolling</b> brim, a <b>circumference</b> of many miles, it finds itself in fairy land; in accordance though with nature on her broadest scale... Tourists might travel in the countries of this imperial ring, and trace their fancies on many a romantic page.
