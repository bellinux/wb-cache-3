40|$|A new <b>refrigeration</b> <b>facility</b> {{suitable}} for experimental investigation a large variety of cold chain applications {{has been designed}} and built from ground up. The system utilizes a cascade approach and combines two screw compressors in DX configuration cooling ethylene glycol/water (EGW) for low and medium temperature applications. The targeted cooling capacity ranges from 100 kW at - 40 oC to 350 kW at 0 oC. Both stages are designed for use with R 410 A; currently the high stage is operated with R 134 a. Unlike systems that are installed in commercial environments, this new facility has been fully instrumented, including test sections with visual access, to obtain accurate performance measurements at different ambient temperatures and load conditions. This paper gives valuable insights and {{lessons learned from the}} design and commissioning process including controls, start-up, and oil return issues.

Implementation of a project of installing and operating a cooling and <b>refrigeration</b> <b>facility,</b> using geothermal fluid as the heating source in combination with an absorption cycle, is being considered. The Lithium Bromide absorption cycle is thought to be feasible for cooling with a COP (coefficient of performance) of about 0. 6.

40|$|An {{experimental}} comparison {{has been}} performed of a cascade <b>refrigeration</b> <b>facility</b> {{working with the}} refrigerant pairs R 134 a/R 744 and R 152 a/R 744. This kind of facility is suitable for industrial and commercial refrigeration applications. The high GWP refrigerant R 134 a has been substituted with the low GWP refrigerant R 152 a, {{in accordance with the}} new environmental regulations aimed at mitigating the Greenhouse effect. As both refrigerants belong to the family of HFC fluids, the replacement has been carried out as a drop-in. Apart from safety considerations, as R 152 a is included in the A 2 group, the results of the wide range of tests conducted show that no special energy improvement or worsening is achieved, and that the replacement of R 134 a with R 152 a is technically and energetically feasible.

30|$|The {{globalisation}} {{of world}} commerce {{is a process}} that permanently alters the living conditions of all human beings. Here in Europe, we meet with the ramifications of these changes on a daily basis. These include the international exchange of goods. Evaluation of the European Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed shows that health safety problems which in recent years have become rare in Europe are more common when dealing with food products imported from third world countries. These include excessive levels of heavy metals, inadequate hygiene, unapproved veterinary pharmaceuticals in animal-derived foodstuffs or excessive levels of pesticides in fruits and vegetables. The Veterinary Border Inspection Post Hesse (TGSH) was created in 1993 {{with the opening of the}} inner-European market. This was necessary in order to provide protection for living animals arriving at Frankfurt/Main Airport as well as to control infectious diseases of animals and importation of animal-derived foodstuffs. On 1 January 2005, the TGSH became Department V of the Hesse State Laboratory. Measured by the number of shipments of animal and plant products, the TGSH is one of the largest ports of entry in Europe. The Perishable Centre Frankfurt (PCF) is a 9, 000 -m² interim <b>refrigeration</b> <b>facility</b> in which imported goods are stored before transport to their final destination.|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} of several atomic hydrogen launch vehicles was conducted. A {{discussion of the}} facilities and the technologies that would be needed for these vehicles is also presented. The Gross Liftoff Weights (GLOW) for two systems were estimated; their specific impulses (I sub sp) were 750 and 1500 lb (sub f) /s/lb(sub m). The atomic hydrogen launch vehicles were also compared to the currently planned Advanced Launch System design concepts. Very significant GLOW reductions of 52 to 58 percent are possible over the Advanced Launch System designs. Applying atomic hydrogen propellants to upper stages was also considered. Very high I(sub sp) (greater than 750 1 b(sub f) /s/lb(sub m) is needed to enable a mass savings over advanced oxygen/hydrogen propulsion. Associated with {{the potential benefits of}} high I(sub sp) atomic hydrogen are several challenging problems. Very high magnetic fields are required to maintain the atomic hydrogen in a solid kilogauss (3 Tesla). Also the storage temperature of the propellant is 4 K. This very low temperature will require a large <b>refrigeration</b> <b>facility</b> for the launch vehicle. The design considerations for a very high recombination rate for the propellant are also discussed. A recombination rate of 210 cm/s is predicted for atomic hydrogen. This high recombination rate can produce very high acceleration for the launch vehicle. Unique insulation or segmentation to inhibit the propellant may be needed to reduce its recombination rate...|$|R

Approach channels were built in 1954, and a pier was built in 1956, which was mainly used by dhows. In 1958, it became a free port and in 1962, a deep water wharf composed of six berths was constructed. The wharf allowed cargo to be directly loaded onto the port for the first time.
