5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{may have}} been slow to turn, {{possibly}} taking one to two seconds to turn only 45° — an amount that humans, being vertically oriented and tailless, can spin in a fraction of a second. The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber horizontally — although it might have reduced the average distance by arching its back and tail and pulling its head and forelimbs close to its body, <b>rather</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> way ice skaters pull their arms closer in order to spin faster.|$|E
5|$|Because the key {{distinguishing}} characteristic Marsh {{noted for}} Pteranodon was {{its lack of}} teeth, any toothless pterosaur jaw fragment, wherever it {{was found in the}} world, tended to be attributed to Pteranodon during {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries. This resulted in a plethora of species and a great deal of confusion. The name became a wastebasket taxon, <b>rather</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> dinosaur Megalosaurus, to label any pterosaur remains that could not be distinguished other than by the absence of teeth. Species (often dubious ones now known to be based on sexual variation or juvenile characters) have been reclassified a number of times, and several subgenera have in the 1970s been erected by Halsey Wilkinson Miller to hold them in various combinations, further confusing the taxonomy (subgenera include Longicepia, Occidentalia, and Geosternbergia). Notable authors who have discussed the various aspects of Pteranodon include Bennett, Padian, Unwin, Kellner, and Wellnhofer. Two species, P. orogensis and P. orientalis, are not pteranodontids and have been renamed Bennettazhia oregonensis and Bogolubovia orientalis respectively.|$|E

5|$|Fossil {{sperm whales}} differ from modern sperm whales in tooth count {{and the shape}} of the face and jaws. For example, Scaldicetus had a tapered rostrum. Genera from the Oligocene and early and middle Miocene, with the {{possible}} exception of Aulophyseter, had teeth in their upper jaws. Acrophyseter, from the late Miocene, also had teeth in both the upper and lower jaws as well as a short rostrum and an upward curving mandible (lower jaw). These anatomical differences suggest that fossil species may not have necessarily been deep-sea squid eaters like the modern sperm whale, but that some genera mainly ate fish. Zygophyseter, dated from the middle to late Miocene and found in southern Italy, had teeth in both jaws and appears to have been adapted to feed on large prey, <b>rather</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> modern Orca (Killer Whale). Other fossil sperm whales with adaptations similar to this are collectively known as killer sperm whales.|$|E

Even in cinemas during the silent movies, singers and instrumentalists appeared in the interval, and a pianist played during the films. Bola de Nieve and María Teresa Vera played in cinemas in their early days. Burlesque was also common in Havana before 1960.|$|E
25|$|Since Oz is {{ruled by}} a monarch, benevolent though she may be, Oz is closer in nature to an {{absolute}} monarchy than a communist or Marxist state. When she was first introduced, Ozma was the monarch specifically of the Emerald City, but {{in the description of}} Ozma of Oz, Oz is presented as a federal state, <b>rather</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> German Empire, in monarchies rather than republics: having an overall ruler in Ozma, and individual kings and queens of smaller portions.|$|E
25|$|The {{board is}} thought to have {{originally}} been in the shape of an equilateral triangle bordered by three rectangles which contained the players' home territories and promotion zones.

The three players occupy non-adjacent sides of the board; the three ranks nearest to them are their territories and their opponents' promotion zones. The 'international' arena inside the three territories remains triangular.|$|E

25|$|The sinus (literally, a bay or inlet) {{appears in}} the Imperial era as a loose over-fold, slung from beneath the left arm, {{downwards}} across the chest, then upwards to the right shoulder. It functioned as a pouch or pocket. Early examples are slender, <b>rather</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> slim, tighter crosswise fold known as the balneus (sword belt) from which the sinus probably derives. Later form of sinus are much fuller; the loop hangs at knee-length, suspended there by draping over the crook of the right arm.|$|E
25|$|In the Meiji era (1868–1912), some Japanese {{scholars}} advocated {{abolishing the}} Japanese writing system entirely and using rōmaji instead. The Nihon-shiki romanization was {{an outgrowth of}} that movement. Several Japanese texts were published entirely in rōmaji during this period, but it failed to catch on. Later, in the early 20th century, some scholars devised syllabary systems with characters derived from Latin (<b>rather</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Cherokee syllabary); these were even less popular, {{because they were not}} based on any historical use of the Latin script. Today, the use of Nihon-shiki for writing Japanese is advocated by the Oomoto sect and some independent organizations.|$|E
25|$|The Miles M.15 {{was built}} in {{response}} to Air Ministry specification T.1/37 which called for a two-seat basic trainer. Two other aircraft manufacturers also built contenders: Parnall Aircraft provided the Heck 3 and Heston Aircraft their Heston T.1/37. The Airspeed AS.36, General Aircraft GAL.32 and Percival P.20 were also proposed against specification T.1/37, but not built. At first sight, the M.15 looked <b>rather</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> earlier Miles Magister, a low cantilever wing monoplane with tandem open cockpits and a fixed, spatted main undercarriage plus tailwheel, powered by a single inverted de Havilland Gipsy series in-line engine. Despite this, the two types differed significantly in powerplant, form and construction.|$|E

25|$|Several {{adaptations to}} piscivory evolved with some groups having crocodile-like skulls with slender snouts, and presumably {{had a similar}} life-style (Archegosauridae, Melosauridae, Cochleosauridae and Eryopidae, and the reptile-like {{suborder}} Embolomeri). Others, evolved as aquatic ambush predators, with short, broad skulls that allowed for opening the mouth by tipping the skull back rather than dropping the jaw (Plagiosauridae and the dvinosaur families). In life they would have hunted <b>rather</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> modern day monkfish, and several groups {{are known to have}} retained the larval gills into adulthood, being fully aquatic. The Metoposauridae adapted to hunting in shallows and murky swamps, with ∩-shaped skull, much like their Devonian ancestors.|$|E
25|$|Roquentin's {{difficulties}} as {{arising from}} man's inherent existential condition. His seemingly special circumstances (returning from travel, reclusiveness), which {{goes beyond the}} mere indication of his very real depression, are supposed to induce in him (and in the reader) a state that makes one more receptive to noticing an existential situation that everyone has, but may not be sensitive enough to let become noticeable. Roquentin undergoes a strange metaphysical experience that estranges him from the world. His problems are not merely a result of personal insanity, without larger significance. <b>Rather,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> characters in the Dostoevsky and Rilke novels, they are victims of larger ideological, social, and existential forces that have {{brought them to the}} brink of insanity. Sartre's point in Nausea is to comment on our universal reaction to these common external problems.|$|E
25|$|Whitney {{received}} a patent (later numbered as X72) for his cotton gin on March 14, 1794, {{but it was}} not validated until 1807. Whitney and his partner, Miller, did not intend to sell the gins. <b>Rather,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> proprietors of grist and sawmills, they expected to charge farmers for cleaning their cotton – two-fifths of the value, paid in cotton. Resentment at this scheme, the mechanical simplicity of the device and the primitive state of patent law, made infringement inevitable. Whitney and Miller could not build enough gins to meet demand, so gins from other makers found ready sale. Ultimately, patent infringement lawsuits consumed the profits and their cotton gin company went out of business in 1797. One oft-overlooked point is that there were drawbacks to Whitney's first design. There is significant evidence that the design flaws were solved by a plantation owner, Catharine Littlefield Greene, wife of the American Revolutionary War general Nathanael Greene; Whitney gave her no public credit or recognition.|$|E

25|$|The new Panorama boasted a {{completely}} new front, featuring a slight peak overhang above the windscreen (which was now optionally undivided), a small grill {{at the bottom of}} the front panel, and for the first time double headlights. Embassy bodies on underfloor-engined chassis shared some or all of these features, depending on the entrance position. However, because the standard offering in the underfloor-engined sector was now the Panorama, most Embassy bodies were built on lightweight front-engined chassis - particularly the Thames 570E and Bedford SB. In this form, with the entrance behind the front axle, the Embassy retained the dished oval grill and wrap-around windscreen of the Consort IV. The rear of both Panorama and Embassy comprised a two-piece curved glass window that wrapped around to meet the rearmost side pillars, and the lights were contained in a single unit with a fin-like top <b>rather</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> rear of the Ford Anglia 105E saloon.|$|E
25|$|In 1887 the American Chess Congress {{started work}} on drawing up {{regulations}} {{for the future}} conduct of world championship contests. Steinitz supported this endeavor, as {{he thought he was}} becoming too old to remain world champion. The proposal evolved through many forms (as Steinitz pointed out, such a project had never been undertaken before), and resulted in the New York 1889 tournament to select a challenger for Steinitz, <b>rather</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> more recent Candidates Tournaments. The tournament was duly played, but the outcome was not quite as planned: Mikhail Chigorin and Max Weiss tied for first place; their play-off resulted in four draws; and neither wanted to play a match against Steinitz – Chigorin had just lost to him, and Weiss wanted to get back to his work for the Rothschild Bank. The third prizewinner Isidore Gunsberg was prepared to play Steinitz for the title in New York, and Steinitz won their match in 1890–91. This experiment was not repeated and the 1894 match in which Steinitz lost his title was a private arrangement between the players.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, {{proposals}} for a modified Hamilton-class cutter with less range or the RN Type 21 frigate with similar anti-submarine capability to a Leander {{but with a}} smaller crew and with less AW, AA and AD. Both these proposals and others for full combat Dutch and FFG-7 frigates were rejected by the Muldoon government {{and in the early}} 1980s a number of retired naval officers and political scientists like Helen Clark and Robert Miles were seriously debating and writing papers and articles, suggesting options such as RN OPVs, the Castle-class and the USCG's WMEC Bear-class. The navy was interested in some of these ideas, but only for the option proposed by the 1978 Defence Review of acquiring 2 OPV vessels to patrol the expanded EEZ and free the Leanders for other uses and for replacement of the inadequate and worn out Lake-class patrol vessels. After the election of the Lange Labour government, thinking on alternatives to frigates for the RNZN had moved towards purpose-built designs <b>rather</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Irish Navy's Eithne patrol corvette, a sort of 1,800-ton high endurance corvette with Leander-like helicopter hangar and pad or small Meko 100–140 designs rather different from those built for Argentina. After the nuclear ships crisis and other events, the acquisition of some Anzac frigates was virtually certain, because the key Labour MP Jim Anderton, either accepted the Anzac ships as a necessary increased self-defence capability with the securing of a nuclear free policy or tacitly agreed not to oppose it like Helen Clark.|$|E
