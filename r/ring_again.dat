5|$|The {{main event}} from Raw was a Last Man Standing match, where {{the goal is}} to {{incapacitate}} the opponent long enough for a 10-count. In his third match of the night, Triple H defended his WWE Championship against Randy Orton. Both men fought extensively outside the ring, both taking advantage of the match stipulations, where there are no countouts or disqualifications. At one point, both men were positioned on top of one of the broadcast tables, where Orton attempted an RKO on Triple H, who countered the move and sent Orton through another of the broadcast tables. Triple H followed this by striking Orton with the steel steps. The men returned to the ring, and Orton performed a DDT and an RKO on Triple H, both onto a steel chair. The competitors returned to the outside of the <b>ring</b> <b>again,</b> and Triple H struck Orton with a chair. They returned {{to the top of the}} broadcast table, and Triple H attempted a Pedigree through the table on Orton, who countered into an RKO onto the table. The referee began a count and reached ten before Triple H could rise; in result, Orton won the match and subsequently regained the WWE Championship.|$|E
5|$|After the Fifth Test seven matches {{remained}} on Bradman's quest {{to go through}} a tour of England without defeat. Australia rested Ring for the match against Kent, which Australia won by an innings. This was followed by a game against the Gentlemen of England, the leading amateurs in the country. Ring was not required to bat as Australia amassed 5/610 before declaring. He then bowled the most overs in the first innings, sending down 25.3 and taking the wickets of English Test batsmen Bill Edrich, Trevor Bailey and Freddie Brown. Ring ended with 3/74 as the hosts were bowled out for 245. Australia enforced the follow on and <b>Ring</b> <b>again</b> shouldered the heaviest workload. He removed Reg Simpson to break the opening stand of 60. The Gentlemen progressed to 3/217 before Ring dismissed Edrich for 128, followed by George Mann for a duck without further addition to the score. Ring then bowled Yardley and dismissed Wilf Wooller soon after, leaving the hosts at 7/240; they were eventually all out for 284, which sealed an innings victory for Australia. Ring ended with 5/70 from 32 overs. The following match against Somerset followed a similar pattern. Ring did not bat as Australia declared at 5/560. He then took 2/17 in the first innings and was not required to bowl in the second innings as the hosts collapsed for 115 and 71 to cede another innings victory.|$|E
25|$|Nate and Sully {{return to}} Yemen. Sully returns Nate's wedding ring, {{which he has}} {{secretly}} kept safe since Nate and Elena's separation. Elena joins them and Nate offers her his wedding <b>ring</b> <b>again.</b> The two embrace and the three fly home on Sully's new sea plane.|$|E
60|$|I {{returned}} to my notes. Soon afterwards the telephone <b>rang</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
60|$|Scarcely had he hung up, {{when the}} bell <b>rang</b> <b>again.</b> This time it was Paula.|$|R
60|$|He tugged violently at the bell-handle, and {{the rusty}} jangling of a bell sounded {{from a distant}} kitchen. He <b>rang</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1920 he was {{discharged}} from his duties at Walter Reed Hospital having reached {{the rank of}} captain. He returned to Long Hill, and with his money dwindling {{made the decision to}} return to the ring. After six months of preparation he faced 'Kid' Green on 28 December 1920. Despite the three and a half-year absence from the ring, Welsh was in good shape and took only four rounds to beat Green; though he had switched his trademark defensive boxing to a heavier brawling style. Welsh then fought twice in May 1921, against Willie Jackson and Kid Murphy, both wins; but the most notable event regarding the bouts was the appearance of heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey, who was spending time relaxing at Welsh's health farm. After two more fights in 1921, both in Canada, Welsh returned to New York to face Archie Walker in April 1922. The fight was a sporting disaster for Welsh, losing seven of the ten rounds, and by the tenth he was being chased around the ring as he covered himself up. It was a pitiful display and Welsh never stepped into a professional <b>ring</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
500|$|Gomez {{attended}} Arthur's next {{fight against}} Ugandan Michael Kizza in Meadowbank, Scotland, but Arthur {{did not appear}} when Gomez fought Ben Odamattey for the WBU super featherweight title in Manchester a few weeks later. Gomez pointed this out when being interviewed shortly afterward, adding [...] "Sky Television want a return. Frank Warren, Arthur's manager, wants a re-match. And most of all so do I." [...] Arthur responded by saying [...] "the fight (with Gomez) is definitely going to happen. Hopefully I'll get another warm-up fight in June and then take on Gomez in September." [...] Despite the rhetoric, the two fighters did not {{meet each other in}} the <b>ring</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
500|$|A {{bell tower}} {{was built to}} dictate {{the running of the}} mission. [...] It would ring each morning at eight; a signal for {{everyone}} to line up for parade in the mission square. [...] Those who failed to line up had their food allocation cut. [...] At nine each evening the bell would <b>ring</b> <b>again</b> signalling the shutting down of the island's electricity. [...] The bell tower still stands in the local square to this day, a relic of Palm's history. [...] It was recorded at the time that there was almost military-like discipline in the segregation between white and black, and that inmates [...] "were treated as rather dull retarded children".|$|E
60|$|The {{door bell}} <b>rang</b> <b>again,</b> and the waiter brought in another bulky parcel, and {{deposited}} {{it on the}} marble-topped centre table.|$|R
60|$|The servant had rung {{the bell}} without {{producing}} any result. He <b>rang</b> <b>again.</b> Lady Holchester put {{a question to}} Sir Patrick.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the bell}} <b>rang</b> <b>again,</b> the bleachers rolled out their {{welcoming}} acclaim, and play was called with Kansas City at the bat.|$|R
2500|$|After having {{surgery on}} his hand, he took to the <b>ring</b> <b>again</b> {{in a fight with}} an unheralded Zeben DÃ­az at [...] in Tenerife, Spain on November 12, 2011. The Spanish judges scored the bout a split {{decision}} in favour of Petrosyan in a fight more straightforward than the scorecards may suggest.|$|E
2500|$|Central to {{the plot}} of the poem is the theme of the buzzard (or other bird of prey) who swoops down from the skies to steal a lady's ring, {{prompting}} her knight to go and find the <b>ring</b> <b>again.</b> The lovers are thus separated for a while, and the knight is given the opportunity for adventure before they are reunited. A popular theme in literature probably deriving from the One Thousand and One Nights material, it first appears in Western literature in Guillaume d'Angleterre and is in use still, as evidenced in Peter Bichsel's [...] "Der Busant" [...] (1998), a story also involving loss of identity. This theme is to be distinguished from what folklorist Gordon Hall Gerould called [...] "the motive of the man tried by fate", since the main character in such stories (Gerould categorizes them as following the Saint Eustace motif) experiences separation from society for different (usually religious) reasons.|$|E
2500|$|Hatton fought Manny Pacquiao on 2 May 2009 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. The {{fight was}} at light welterweight, {{which was the}} sixth weight {{category}} Pacquiao has fought at and is the weight at which Hatton was previously undefeated. Pacquiao defeated Hatton {{in the second round}} by a KO victory after knocking Hatton down twice in the first round. Following the loss to Pacquiao, Hatton put his career on hiatus. After more than a year out of action, in a June 2010 interview with Gulfnews.com, the British boxer seemed uninterested in coming to the <b>ring</b> <b>again.</b> He stated: [...] "Boxing started off as a habit and it ended up giving me some money and making me {{a little bit of a}} better person. But I don't think I will have a fight again. But you can never say never as I have not announced officially that I won't be boxing. At the moment I don't have any fire in the belly for a fight or to get myself to a gym." [...] However, Hatton also added: [...] "But it has been only 13 months and I am only 31, so never count me out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I say war!" [...] cried Ulf, {{striking}} the board so violently with his clenched fist that the tankards and platters leaped and <b>rang</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
6000|$|THE PRINCESS. Oh dear! [It <b>rings</b> <b>again.</b> She looks scared. It <b>rings</b> <b>again.</b> She {{approaches}} it timidly. It <b>rings</b> <b>again.</b> She retreats hastily. It rings repeatedly. She runs to it {{in desperation}} and puts the receiver to her ear.] Who is there? What do I do? I am not used to the telephone: I don't know how--What! Oh, I can hear you speaking quite distinctly. [She sits down, delighted, and settles herself for a conversation.] How wonderful! What! A lady? Oh! a person. Oh, yes: I know. Yes, please, send her up. Have my servants finished their lunch yet? Oh no: please don't disturb them: I'd rather not. It doesn't matter. Thank you. What? Oh yes, it's quite easy. I had no idea--am I to hang it up just as it was? Thank you. [She hangs it up.] ...|$|R
60|$|I sat on {{the edge}} of the bed, waiting. In less than ten minutes the {{telephone}} bell <b>rang</b> <b>again.</b> Once more I heard Ashley's voice.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he turned}} to the <b>ring</b> <b>again,</b> and {{announced}} the names a second time.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Life over here's a game!' thought Val. 'Muffin bell rings, horses run, money changes hands; <b>ring</b> <b>again,</b> run again, money changes back.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Peg is so very deaf,' {{answered}} Gride {{with a look}} {{of anxiety}} and alarm. 'Oh dear! <b>Ring</b> <b>again,</b> coachman. She SEES the bell.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think so," [...] replied Phil, shortly; {{and then}} the school-bell <b>rang</b> <b>again</b> and all the boys {{had to go to}} their next classes.|$|R
60|$|She sat {{motionless}} {{while the}} doorbell <b>rang,</b> and <b>rang</b> <b>again.</b> Nothing must {{interfere with the}} pretty denouement she had so fondly anticipated when Louise's faithful knight came to her.|$|R
60|$|The {{telephone}} <b>rang</b> <b>again.</b> This {{time it was}} Monsieur Grisson who was required. He {{listened for}} a moment or two with inscrutable countenance. Then he glanced at the clock.|$|R
6000|$|... "What of her?" [...] {{broke out}} Mat, rising {{to his feet}} with flushed face and {{threatening}} eyes, and making the room <b>ring</b> <b>again</b> as he grounded his rifle on the floor.|$|E
60|$|This was {{all very}} well; but, one day, as they were talking together, the king {{happened}} to enter the room, and although Hans quickly changed himself into a <b>ring</b> <b>again</b> it was too late.|$|E
60|$|Ebbo essayed, but was too faint, and Friedel, rousing {{himself from}} the stupor, took the horn from him, and made the {{mountain}} echoes <b>ring</b> <b>again,</b> but {{at the expense of}} a great effusion of blood.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hollo!' said Wardle; 'for a case {{in which}} there's nothing suspicious, this looks rather queer--eh, Pickwick? Ah, sly dog--sly dog!' and he laughed till the glasses on the {{sideboard}} <b>rang</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
60|$|The car drew {{up outside}} Quest's house. The Inspector {{assisted}} his companion to alight and {{rang the bell}} at the front door. There was a somewhat prolonged pause. He <b>rang</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
60|$|And {{falling on}} a bench, he laughed until the tears {{ran down his}} cheeks. I could not help joining, and we laughed together, peal after peal, until the tavern <b>rang</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
60|$|Sir Timothy {{made his}} way into the house and into the low, oak-beamed study with its dark {{furniture}} and latticed windows. The telephone bell began to <b>ring</b> <b>again</b> as he entered. He took up the receiver.|$|E
6000|$|... "His present address, sir, is THE GRAVE," [...] says Mrs. Threadgall, {{suddenly}} {{losing her}} temper, and speaking {{with an emphasis}} and fury that made the glasses <b>ring</b> <b>again.</b> [...] "The Professor has been dead these ten years." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{this took}} time, of course, but Phil got his reward at last, {{for one night}} a little thing {{happened}} which showed him his own progress, and made Pris feel that she might venture to wear the <b>ring</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mr. Merriman was delighted. He laughed over my retort {{till the}} room <b>rang</b> <b>again.</b> I was not half so good-humoured on my side; I {{came back to}} business, and closed the interview.|$|R
60|$|The old man uttered an irrepressible cry. Almost at {{the same}} moment, the beg of the great gate <b>rang</b> <b>again,</b> and a loud noise of feet and voices came pouring into the courtyard.|$|R
6000|$|... "The giant stamped {{his foot}} with such {{violence}} {{that all the}} glasses, cups, and vials in the room <b>rang</b> <b>again,</b> and, clapping both hands over his mouth, he bent himself double in a paroxysm of agony.|$|R
