Under the proposed strategy, the vendor buys a non-deteriorating materials to vendor a deteriorating <b>finished</b> <b>product,</b> delivers the <b>finished</b> <b>product</b> to all retailers by common replenishment periods based on VMI (vendor managed inventory) being implemented.

40|$|The {{mining company}} LKAB {{extracts}} iron ore in three {{areas in the}} north of Sweden, Kiruna, Malmberget and Svappavaara. The iron ore is refined and in the pelletizing plants the material is <b>rolled</b> to <b>finished</b> pellet <b>product.</b> The different steps of pelletizing plants causes among other things emissions to the air. It occurs occasionally stops in the production and the emissions are vented via an emergency chimney without purification. The aim for this work is to look into how LKAB may improve their monitoring of air emissions and control of ambient air quality and the analysis methods which are suitable for measuring. More recently, optical methods have been included in the measurements, which have an advantage over the collection of sample for analysis in a laboratory. The work has been limited to air emissions and optical methods. Through extensive literature review, questions has been answered on regarding which are the most important parameters to measure concerning air emissions, which methods that are suitable for continuous measurement and the parameters that are important in meteorological dispersion modeling. Three different methods of measurement are included, DOAS, FT-IR and LIDAR. The optical methods are discussed on the basis of how they can apply for adjustment to LKAB’s operations and its northern geographical location. A method suited better than the others, DOAS, which is the measuring method to be adapted best to LKAB’s operations and for measurement of the emergency chimney. Measurement results from DOAS {{can be used to make}} a dispersion model. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractManagement of {{microbiological}} {{food safety}} is {{largely based on}} good design of processes, <b>products</b> and procedures. <b>Finished</b> <b>product</b> testing may {{be considered as a}} control measure {{at the end of the}} production process. However, testing gives only very limited information on the safety status of a food. If a hazardous organism is found it means something, but absence in a limited number of samples is no guarantee of safety of a whole production batch. <b>Finished</b> <b>product</b> testing is often too little and too late. Therefore most attention should be focussed on management and control of the hazards in a more pro-active way by implementing an effective food safety management system. For verification activities in a food safety management system, <b>finished</b> <b>product</b> testing may however be useful. For three cases studies; canned food, chocolate and cooked ham, the relevance of testing both of <b>finished</b> <b>products</b> and the production environment is discussed.
