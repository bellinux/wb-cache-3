5000|$|On 5 August 1944, {{about 40}} minutes after midnight Mefküre was about 25 mi {{northeast}} of İğneada in Turkey when flares from an unknown vessel illuminated her.

In the same night, at 02:00 hrs, the German <b>radio</b> <b>direction-finding</b> <b>station</b> at Cape Pomorie in the Gulf of Burgas intercepted a radio signal of the Soviet , , with a bearing of 116 degrees. “This bearing crossed the course of Mefkure and the two Turkish vessels almost exactly at the area where Mefkure was sunk during that night.” [...] The German historian Jürgen Rohwer claimed Shch-215 as the vessel which then attacked. Shch-215 fired 90 rounds from her 45-mm guns and 650 rounds from her 7.62 mm machine guns. Mefküre caught fire and sank. Her captain, Kazım Turan, and six of his crew escaped in a lifeboat but only five of the refugees survived. The number of refugees killed is unknown, but one estimate suggests it includes 37 children.|$|E
