50|$|In the LLNL RISE {{process a}} part of the oil shale deposit (roughly 20% of the total deposit) is removed by the {{conventional}} mining technique. The remaining deposit the is broken with explosives to increase porosity of the deposit. As a result, a large underground <b>retort</b> <b>chamber</b> by 20 to 100 m square and 100 to 300 m high is created. The <b>retort</b> <b>chamber</b> is ignited at the top. The combustion zone moves downward as an oxygen gas provided, similar to the process developed by the Occidental Petroleum. The heat causes retorting process converting kerogen in oil shale to oil shale gas and shale oil vapors. Some oil is collected {{at the bottom of the}} retort, other collected at the surface as vapors.|$|E
30|$|Unit {{operation}} # 2 utilizes {{a specifically}} designed <b>retort</b> <b>chamber</b> that operates in the 1400 – 1550  F (760 – 843  °C) range. The retort {{is a long}} cylinder {{with a series of}} internal spiral flights. The retort was manufactured from a wrought alloy, RA- 330, that is suitable for the temperature range (i.e., 1700  F (927  °C) maximum) and not reactive with the pyrolysis compounds. The outer casing was designed to withstand 345  kilopascals (50  psig) internal pressure. The vessel and dished ends were constructed of mild steel plates per American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) boiler pressure vessel codes. Ceramic fiber modules, 25  cm thick and 10  in. thick with a density of 160  kg/m 3, were provided and stud welded to the furnace sidewalls, roof, and discharge end wall. The retort rotates around its longitudinal axis such that the spiral flights convey the feedstock from end to end in a defined period of time. Various devices (e.g., bars and rakes) are used between the flights to cause the feedstock to tumble and improve the rate of heat transfer.|$|E

50|$|The company {{conducted}} the first modified in situ oil shale experiment in 1972 at Logan Wash, Colorado. The process used explosives to create underground <b>chambers</b> (<b>retorts)</b> of fractured oil shale. About 20% was mined out after which blasting {{was used to}} fracture oil shale. The commercial-sized retort covered 333 by 166 ft area and had height of 400 ft. Oil shale was then ignited on the top by external fuel, and air or steam was injected to control the process. As a result, combustion moved from the top {{to the bottom of}} retort.|$|R
40|$|Unavoidable process {{temperature}} deviations in retort operations can compromise product safety and quality {{as well as}} production efficiency if improperly handled. Two methods, the Fixed Point (FP) and the Worst Case (WC) methods, aimed to automatically correct the adverse effect of those {{process temperature}} deviations during thermal processes in the operations of continuous retorts were developed. These methods {{have the potential to}} quickly analyze and accurately estimate the effect of process deviations on the thermal lethality of canned foods processed in continuous retorts. The FP algorithm consists of the selection of a point that for convenience is located close to the <b>retort</b> steam <b>chamber</b> exit, whereas the WC algorithm consists of searching for the worst case container, defined as the one requiring the lowest conveyor speed. Simulations showed that the computation time for estimating conveyor speed adjustments using both algorithms was less than 1 second in a personal desktop Pentium IV computer. ^ Accurate heat transfer calculations are the basis for developing suitable control algorithms. The Apparent Position Numerical Solution (APNS) method, which was used in the control algorithms developed in this study, did not provide a good temperature prediction in the initial stage of the process cooling phase. A mathematical method was developed to fix this problem. Heat transfer calculations using numerical methods rely on accurate heat penetration parameters. For thermal processes of starch based food systems, which exhibit a broken-line heating behavior, the heating parameters are strongly associated to the viscosity changes during the heating stage. Major factors affecting the viscosity of swollen crosslinked corn starch (CCS) suspensions were identified and a mathematical model to estimate changes of viscosity was developed in this study. A method to predict the momentary granule sizes, which are closely related to viscosity of a starch suspension, under non-isothermal conditions was also developed. Accurate evaluation of thermal lethality is essential for thermal process design and control. The Weibull model provides a better estimation of process lethality than conventional first-order kinetics. A numerical method suitable for on-line estimation of thermal lethality under non-isothermal conditions was also developed in this study. ...|$|R
