25|$|In 1962, a large <b>rudderpost</b> {{indicating}} a rudder area of 452 square feet was unearthed at the Longjiang Shipyard. The dimensions of this <b>rudderpost</b> corresponds with a ship of between 538 and 600 feet in length, lending {{credence to the}} notion that ships of these dimensions were indeed built.|$|E
25|$|A yawl {{is similar}} to a ketch, with a shorter mizzen mast carried astern the <b>rudderpost</b> more for {{balancing}} the helm than propulsion.|$|E
50|$|A small ship, fore-and-aft rigged on its two masts, {{with its}} {{mainmast}} much taller than its mizzen and {{with or without}} headsails. The mizzen mast is located aft of the <b>rudderpost,</b> sometimes directly on the transom, and is intended to help provide helm balance.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{the radical}} {{concept of the}} medieval pintle-and-gudgeon rudder did not come as a single {{invention}} into being. It presented rather a combination of ideas which each had been long around before: rudders mounted on the stern, iron hinges and the straight sternpost of northern European ships. While earlier rudders were mounted on the stern by the way of <b>rudderposts</b> or tackles, the iron hinges allowed {{for the first time}} to attach the rudder to the entire length of the sternpost in a really permanent fashion. However, its full potential could only to be realized after the introduction of the vertical sternpost and the full-rigged ship in the 14th century. From the age of discovery onwards, European ships with pintle-and-gudgeon rudders sailed successfully on all seven seas.|$|R

However, Lawrence Mott in his master thesis stated that the method of attachment for rudders in the Chinese and European worlds differed from each other, leading him to doubt the spread of the Chinese system of attachment ...|$|R
5000|$|... the yawl, {{characterized}} by a two mast configuration with the largest mast forward, is distinguished from the ketch by the smaller size of the mizzen mast, typically aft of the <b>rudderpost</b> in traditional sailing craft, but is not a driving sail. The mizzen mast is used to assist steering the boat and balancing the helm.|$|E
5000|$|If a boat has two masts, {{it may be}} a {{schooner}}, a ketch, or a yawl, if it is rigged fore-and-aft on all masts. A schooner {{may have}} any number of masts provided the second from the front is the tallest (called the [...] "main mast"). In both a ketch and a yawl, the foremost mast is tallest, and thus the main mast, while the rear mast is shorter, and called the mizzen mast. The difference between a ketch and a yawl is that in a ketch, the mizzen mast is forward of the <b>rudderpost</b> (the axis of rotation for the rudder), while a yawl has its mizzen mast behind the <b>rudderpost.</b> In modern parlance, a brigantine is a vessel whose forward mast is rigged with square sails, while her after mast is rigged fore-and-aft. A brig is a vessel with two masts both rigged square.|$|E
50|$|The NiD 740 had conventional, fixed, {{independent}} landing gear, {{with each}} wheel mounted at the vertex of a V-strut hinged {{on the central}} fuselage underside. These gave the undercarriage a track of 3.50 m and placed the wheels directly below the outer engines. Vertical sprung legs, fitted with Messier shock absorbers, joined wheels and the engine-bearing frames. The wheels had brakes (also by Messier) {{which could be used}} differentially for ground steering. There was a short tailskid below the <b>rudderpost.</b> A pair of searchlights were fitted close together below the nose to help with night landings.|$|E
5000|$|Flyer and King's Legend {{left the}} other {{competitors}} far behind. During the first stage, a thousand nautical miles before Cape Town, both ships were still within visual range of each other, {{but in the}} end Flyer managed to win the first stage by 2 hours and 4 minutes. During the second stage, from Cape Horn to New Zealand, King's Legend managed to get ahead of the Flyer by 360 nautical miles, until a leak was discovered at the <b>rudderpost.</b> It took two days to get it under control. Novak described the event as [...] "a stark reminder that these are desolate oceans populated only by albatross, whales and ice, with no shipping within thousands of miles."." [...] The incident cost King's Legend {{a large portion of the}} lead.|$|E
5000|$|A {{small ship}} with two masts, both fore-and-aft rigged, with the mizzen located well {{forward of the}} <b>rudderpost</b> and of only {{slightly}} smaller size than the mainmast (if {{the height of the}} masts were reversed—the taller in the back and the shorter in the front—it would be considered a schooner). If square rigged on her mainmast above the course, it is called a [...] "square topsail ketch". Historically the mainmast was square rigged instead of fore-and-aft, but in modern usage only the latter is called a ketch. The purpose of the mizzen sail in a ketch rig, unlike the mizzen on a yawl rig, is to provide drive to the hull. A ketch rig allows for shorter sails than a sloop with the same sail area, resulting in a lower center of sail and less overturning moment. The shorter masts therefore reduce the amount of ballast and stress on the rigging needed to keep the boat upright. Generally the rig is safer and less prone to broaching or capsize than a comparable sloop, and has more flexibility in sail plan when reducing sail under strong crosswind conditions—the mainsail can be brought down entirely (not requiring reefing) and the remaining rig will be both balanced on the helm and capable of driving the boat. The ketch is a classic small cargo boat.|$|E
5000|$|... "was lying at Syracuse and {{received}} a wire from Malta to proceed at once to {{the help of a}} British steamer aground on the island of Pantellaria, on which service she got far worst aground herself. Anchors were laid out, coal jettisoned, guns, ammunition and stores hoisted over the side into small casters in the island hired on the spot, and everything possible done to lighten her, but she remained a fixture except to sway in the swell from the open sea, strain her back, and wrench off her sternpost, <b>rudderpost</b> and rudder. It took some time to summon help, as that was a full generation before the days of wireless telegraphy and Pantellaria had no cables; but an officer was dispatched by a passing steamer to Malta, where the [...] was lying as flagship and came at once to pull her crippled sister off the floor and get her to bed. This proved an extremely difficult job even when she was afloat again, as she yawed about so violently without a rudder when in tow, as to pull the sister in charge all over the place. It took three days to conduct erring footsteps a distance that could ordinarily be covered in less than one, and all the while she was leaking at a steady rate of 2 feet per hour. On arrival at Malta she had to be docked with great care on account of the badly damaged state of her bottom; and the yard reported that it would take six months to repair." ...|$|E
