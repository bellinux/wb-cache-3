40|$|Cultures {{taken from}} the skin and from the hubs of {{short-term}} central venous catheters can help us to predict catheter-related bloodstream infections (C-RBSIs). The value of these cultures for such predictions has not been assessed in long-term catheters. Our objective {{was to assess the}} value of superficial cultures for the prediction of C-RBSI among patients with long-term cathe-ters. Over a 2 -year period, we prospectively obtained cultures from the skin overlying <b>reservoir</b> <b>ports</b> (group A) and from the skin insertion site and hubs of all tunneled catheters (group B). This routine was performed by vascular and interventional radi-ologists immediately before catheter removal (irrespective of the reason for withdrawal). Swabs were processed semiquantita-tively. Catheter tips from both groups were cultured usingMaki’s semiquantitative technique and sonication. We also per-formed cultures of the <b>reservoir</b> <b>ports</b> at different sites. C-RBSI was defined as the isolation of the same species of microorganism(s) both in the colonized catheter and in at least 1 peripheral blood culture. We included 372 catheters (group A, 223; group B, 149) during the study period. The catheter colonization rate was 23. 4 % (87 / 372), and 28 patients had C-RBSI. Va-lidity index values for the capacity of surface cultures to predict C-RBSI in groups A and B were, respectively, as follows: sensitiv-ity, 23. 5 % and 45. 5 %; specificity, 59. 7 % and 63. 0 %; positive predictive value, 4. 6 % and 8. 9 %; and negative predictive value, 90. 4 % and 93. 5 %. Superficial cultures of patients with long-term catheters could help us to rule out the catheter as the portal of entry of bloodstream infections.

40|$|Important {{aspect of}} bottom sediments {{is the problem}} of their {{management}} or disposal after their extraction from the bottom of rivers, dam <b>reservoirs,</b> <b>ports,</b> channels or ponds. The research aimed at an assessment of potential environmental management of bottom sediment used as an admixture to light soil basing on its effect on contents of heavy metals in plants and soil. The research was conducted on light soil with granulometric structure of weakly loamy sand. The bottom sediment was added to light soil in the amount of 0 (control) 5, 10, 30 i 50 %. The test plant was maize (Zea mays), “Bora” c. v. The sediment applied in the presented research revealed high share of silt and clay fractions, alkaline pH and low contents of heavy metals, therefore it may be used as an admixture to the above mentioned soils to improve their productivity.

30|$|While {{reporting}} the first cohort of TIVAP-related infections in the ICU, this retrospective study has some limitations. As we obtained data from patient’s medical charts, we cannot {{pretend to be}} exhaustive in data collection. Important information such as presence of thrombosis or endocarditis associated with TIVAP-related infection would have been interesting, but not all patients had a Doppler ultrasonography at time of admission. Then, {{it is likely that}} all patients with TIVAP admitted in participating ICU were not enrolled in the study since the main inclusion criteria was TIVAP removal. As a matter of fact, our inclusion criteria could have biased the true incidence of TIVAP-related infection toward overestimation. Due to the retrospective nature of the study, {{it was not possible to}} systematically identify patients who may have been admitted in our ICUs with a TIVAP in place that was not removed. The fact that positive blood cultures were available prior TIVAP removal may have also influenced clinicians’ decision. However, ICUs participating in the study had homogeneous practices regarding admission policy of immunocompromised patients and the decision to remove TIVAP in case of life-threatening sepsis. Last, the definition of TIVAP-related infection was extended to patients with positive blood culture without other suspected infection (n[*]=[*] 12) and regression of clinical signs of infection after TIVAP removal despite negative culture of TIVAP (catheter tip or the <b>reservoir’s</b> <b>port).</b> Since all our patients received antibiotics prior TIVAP removal, a condition that could fairly lead to misclassification, we estimated legitimate to consider these twelve patients as having TIVAP-related infection.|$|R
40|$|Another {{round of}} market / {{business}} favouring reform {{is changing the}} arrangements for strategic planning in England. This will merge existing arrangements for statutory regional and strategic planning (Regional Spatial Strategies) and for regional economic planning (Regional Economic Strategies) and award the making of this new single strategy to the business led Regional Development Agencies. Regional assemblies, who since about 2001 had prepared the RSSs, will be abolished by 2010. This reform sits within a wider swathe of pro-development government instructions to local authorities and other public bodies, including revised guidance on housing, economy and retail planning, and orders to increase the release of housebuilding land across all regions. This rests alongside {{the creation of a}} new machinery for infrastructure planning, within a government appointed Infrastructure Planning Commission, which will decide on all major infrastructure (power stations, <b>reservoirs,</b> <b>ports,</b> airports, road and rail schemes etc), within nationally set guidelines. Together this major reorientation of national, regional and strategic planning will (assuming the relevant legislation and arrangements go through as planned) introduce a new character to this public activity in England. This paper sketches some features that may be associated with these changes. These include: • A shift from strategic planning to implementation, both “strategic ” and project based. • A shifting of arenas of debate and conflict. • More research, but more targetted / skewed research. • Potentially more integrated planning? The paper argues that it is the joint effect of these new institutional and policy directions which will be critical to the operation of English planning. A comprehensive new regime regulating development is being put in place in 2008 - 2009, which is likely to oversee the redrawing of English regional and subregional geographies along more development and business friendly lines. ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives Intrathecal {{drug therapy}} is being {{utilized}} increasingly {{for the treatment}} of chronic refractory pain. However, performing the regular pump refill procedures caries the potential risk of medication injection into the subcutaneous tissue. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the accuracy of this template-guided refill technique by means of fluoroscopic evaluation. Materials and Methods In 23 patients, the difference between the identification of the <b>reservoir</b> fill <b>port</b> center using the manufacturer's template and fluoroscopic guidance was assessed on four consecutive refill procedures by a two physicians. A distance surpassing that between the center and the margin of the port (3. 5 mm) was considered a clinically relevant deviation. Analyses were performed with a one-sample t-test, with p < 0. 05 indicating statistical significance. Results The mean difference distance between identification markings of the target with fluoroscopic guidance and with the template was 8. 2 -mm, with limited variance (2. 7 -mm). For all individual refill procedures, the port center identification accuracy differed significantly from zero (all p < 0. 001) and from the clinically relevant cut-off point of 3. 5 -mm (all p < 0. 001). Only seven attempts (6. 4 %) were within the margins of the fill port. Conclusions Our results suggest poor accuracy of insertion point identification using the template. This highlights the potential risk of errors related to identification of the puncture site using the template-guided technique...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Insertion of totally implantable {{catheters}} via deep {{vessels that}} drain into the superior vena cava {{results in a}} lower incidence of venous thrombosis and infection as compared to catheters inserted into femoral and arm veins. Superior vena cava obstruction and inadequacy of the thoracic wall are conditions that prevent reservoir implantation in the chest wall. In this article, we describe a technical innovation that enables the pocket to be fixed in the arm while still allowing access to be achieved via the internal jugular vein. Method: The procedure reported maintains {{the use of the}} internal jugular vein for access even when the patient's chest is not suited for reservoir implantation, which is localized in the arm. Results: The procedure was successful and no complications occurred. The position of the catheter tip did not alter with arm movement.

40|$|Subclavian {{percutaneous}} access with reservoir placement {{has been}} shown to be difficult or contraindicated in some patients. Of 465 cancer patients who required a port placement between January 1992 to January 1995, 41 (8. 8 %) had alternative percutaneous femoral access with a totally implantable <b>port</b> <b>reservoir</b> located in the abdomen because of the inaccessibility to subclavian or jugular veins and/or the presence of massive cutaneous metastases or severe radiodermitis in the upper part of the torso. Overall implant days was 9880, with an average of 241 days (range: 65 - 445). Ports were alternatively used for chemotherapy and nutritional purposes in 11 of 41 patients. Late morbidity causing the removal of the implanted ports was observed in two of 41 (4. 9 %) and 25 of 424 (5. 9 %) patients in the femoral and subclavian series, respectively (P = 0. 86). The femoral percutaneous access for totally implantable port devices appears to be a safe alternative for cancer patients when subclavian and/or jugular vein catheterization and reservoir in the upper part of the torso is contraindicated...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTOtherwise unexplained {{clinical}} signs of infection {{in patients with}} long-term tunnelled or totally implanted central venous access devices (CVADs) are suspected to be CVAD-associated. Diagnostic methods include catheter swabs, blood cultures and cultures of the catheter tip or <b>port</b> <b>reservoir.</b> In {{the case of a}} suspected CVAD-related bloodstream infection in paediatric oncology patients, in-situ treatment without prompt removal of the device can be attempted. Removal of the CVAD should be considered if bacteraemia persists or relapses ≥ 72 h after the initiation of (in-vitro effective) antibacterial therapy administered through the line. Timely removal of the device is also recommended if the patient suffers from a complicated infection, or if Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii or Candida spp. are isolated from blood cultures. Duration of therapy depends on the immunological recovery of the patient, the pathogen isolated and the presence of related complications, such as thrombosis, pneumonia, endocarditis and osteomyelitis. Antibiotic lock techniques in addition to systemic treatment are beneficial for Gram-positive infections. Although prospectively controlled studies are lacking, the concomitant use of urokinase locks and taurolidine secondary prophylaxis seem to favour catheter salvage...|$|R
40|$|Turbidity {{currents}} {{are major}} transport agents in reservoirs in which {{high concentrations of}} fine sediments flow in. Reservoir sedimentation due to turbidity currents is often severe in these cases. Turbidity currents are not well understood due to their complex turbulent flow structure, {{the interaction between the}} flow with the particles and the interaction between particles themselves. In this thesis the venting efficiency was determined for three reservoir implementations that might decrease sedimentation caused by turbidity currents. The three were: an additional sediment sluice, blocking a part of the reservoir and a deepened thalweg. Computations were done by means of a Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) model. The Shihmen Reservoir in Taiwan was taken as a case study. In this particular reservoir suspended sediment concentrations are measured during the event of a turbidity current. According to the model results the additional sediment sluicing tunnel was the most effective solution. Results indicated that the location of such a tunnel and the reservoir operation method applied are thereby important to increase the venting efficiency. It was shown that a RANS model such as presented, is able to capture the complex behaviour of turbidity currents in reservoirs and is therefore a valuable tool for <b>reservoir</b> managers.

30|$|The {{following}} {{data were}} extracted from each patient’s medical record: age, gender, clinical and biological variables on admission. Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) 2 [22] and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) [23] were calculated upon ICU admission. Predisposing {{risk factors for}} TIVAP-related infections were also collected: immunosuppression status (i.e., hematological malignancies, solid organ transplant, recent antineoplastic chemotherapy for cancer or HIV infection), time since TIVAP insertion, main indication of the TIVAP (antineoplastic chemotherapy, parenteral nutrition), date of last antineoplastic chemotherapy and delay between ICU admission and removal of the device. We also looked through each patient’s record for local signs of infection (induration or erythema, warmth and pain or tenderness along the tract of a catheterized vein) whenever it was described and general sign of infection (fever defined as temperature ≥[*] 38 ° 3, hypothermia defined as temperature <[*] 36 °, hypotension defined as systolic blood pressure <[*] 90  mmHg or mean blood pressure <[*] 65  mmHg). Advanced life support measures taken during the ICU stay (mechanical ventilation and vasopressors) and antibiotics regimens were recorded for each patient. Microbiological data were collected as follows: positive culture of TIVAP catheter tip or <b>port</b> <b>reservoir,</b> positive blood culture from the TIVAP and from a peripheral vein with the differential time to positivity. We also collected information regarding use of appropriate antibiotic in initial regimen (antibiotics with in vitro activity against the infecting agent). Finally, we recorded length of ICU stay, time spent under invasive mechanical ventilation and vasopressors. Mortality was determined in the ICU, at 28  days and 6  months after ICU admission.|$|R
