25|$|Many NGOs {{are active}} in the Honduran water supply and {{sanitation}} sector. One of them is the Fundación Agua para Todos (FUNDAPAT) or Foundation Water for Everybody, created in 1992 on the basis of an initiative of UNICEF, SANAA, the Tegucigalpa Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Media Association. FUNDAPAT has reached to extend coverage of potable water to 105,000 persons in 104 communities, in particular in the metropolitan area of Tegucigalpa. The communities pay back investment into a <b>rotating</b> <b>fund</b> without interests to maintain the Foundation's capital and make possible the extension of coverage to more quarters. SANAA created a special unit for supporting those projects in poor areas.|$|E

50|$|Finance: The ICO Act also {{established}} a £250,000 <b>rotating</b> loan <b>fund</b> managed by Industrial Common Ownership Finance Ltd (ICOF). ICOF — since 2005 trading as Co-operative and Community Finance- has grown steadily and now manages {{a range of}} funds totalling some £4.5 million. Some of these have been endowed by public bodies, and others were raised through public subscription. This {{was the start of}} the ethical investment movement in Britain.|$|R
40|$|Almost {{two thirds}} of the cross-plant {{dispersion}} in marginal revenue products of capital occurs across plants within the same firm rather than between firms. Even though firms allocate invest- ment very differently across their plants, they do not equalize marginal revenue products across their plants. We reconcile these findings in a model of multi-plant firms, physical adjustment costs and credit constraints. Credit constrained multi-plant firms can utilize internal capital markets by concentrating internal funds on investment projects in only a few of their plants in a given period and <b>rotating</b> <b>funds</b> to another set of plants in the future. The resulting increase in within-firm dispersion of marginal revenue products of capital is hence not a symptom of misallocation within the firm, but rather actions taken by the firm to mitigate external credit constraints and adjustment costs of capital. Economies with multi-plant firms produce more aggregate output despite higher dispersion in marginal revenue products of capital compared to economies with single-plant firms. Because emerging economies are predominantly populated by single-plant firms, the gains from reducing their distortions to the level of developed are larger than previously thought...|$|R
25|$|Unger's work {{in office}} {{was an attempt}} to enact his program. Seeing the future in small {{enterprises}} and advocating a <b>rotating</b> capital <b>fund</b> that would function like a government run venture capital fund, he pushed for a rapid expansion of credit to smaller producers and a decentralized network of technical support centers that would help broaden the middle class from below. He further called for political solutions that would broaden access to production forces such as information technology, and for states to focus on equipping and monitoring civil society rather than trying to provide social services.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examined}} {{the nature and}} extent of informal savings and credit among women micro-entrepreneurs in five rural communities of Ado-Odo/Ota Local Government Area of Nigeria. It is a household study of 275 women engaged in various rural on-farm and off-farm activities. Our study has shown that informal savings in form of Ajo Esusu in its various forms (fixed fund and <b>rotating</b> <b>fund)</b> is popular among the rural women of Ado-Odo/Ota Local government of Ogun State. Participation rate is as high as 78 % while average monthly savings mobilized is about N 708, 500 from our respondents. In addition to own savings, some of our respondents are able to source credit in form of loans from their savings associations. These savings and credit are applied to various developmemtal and consumption uses. Participants in these informal saving schemes reported improved business development and incomes. Our recommendation that necessary environment be created for the intervention of private, not-for-profit semi-formal financial intermediatries, will go a long way in facilitating domestic credit mobilization, just like Grameen bank in Bangladesh. This initiative, unlike the past corrupt-ridden and ineffective government-operated organizations, is expected to support the activities of informal savungs associations, create a better link with formal financial system and hence, help to improve rural women-owned enterprises, as well as their status in Nigeria...|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{the theory}} would involve radical {{developments}} in {{politics at the}} center, {{as well as social}} innovation in localities. At the center, by bestowing wide ranging revising powers to those in office, it would give political parties the ability to try out concrete yet profound solutions and proposals. It would turn partisan conflicts over control and uses of governmental power into an opportunity to question and revise the basic arrangements of social life through a rapid resolution of political impasse. In local communities, empowered democracy would make capital and technology available through <b>rotating</b> capital <b>funds,</b> which would encourage entrepreneurship and innovation. Citizens' rights include individual entitlements to economic and civic security, conditional and temporary group claims to portions of social capital, and destabilization rights, which would empower individuals or groups to disrupt organizations and practices marred by routines of subjugation that normal politics have failed to disrupt.|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between portfolio country versus industry concentration and performance using a hand-matched data set of international equity funds. When sorted by concentration measures, funds in the most concentrated quintile outperform the diversified quintile by 0. 16 % and 0. 30 % monthly in country and industry dimensions, respectively. Further analysis shows that the superior performance of concentrated funds is largely driven by industry rather than country concentration, suggesting the existence of global industry private information. Finally, we show that industry-concentrated <b>funds</b> <b>rotate</b> top-holding industries less frequently than their diversified counterparts and the industries they purchase subsequently outperform the industries they sell...|$|R
30|$|Major sectors {{highlighted}} {{in the survey}} were agriculture, services and manufacturing; {{the highest number of}} enterprises belongs to other categories (47.4  %) followed by services sector (42.7  %), manufacturing (7.1  %) and agriculture (2.8  %). As a response to the reason of starting the business, 41.9  % mentions personal interest as the main reason followed by earning additional income (22.9  %), economic hardship (14.6  %), no alternative (9.1  %), by inheritance (7.9  %) and by profession (3.6  %). Most of the enterprises included in the survey are urban based (91.3  %) and 8.7  % are rural based. In terms of initial and current sources finance, personal savings (68.4  %) is found to be {{on the top of the}} list followed by <b>rotating</b> credit scheme, <b>funds</b> from relatives/bank loans, micro finance institutions, others and cooperative societies.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{programmatic}} {{section of}} False Necessity, Unger seeks to merge the modernist visionary's criticism of personal {{relations with the}} leftist's critique of collective institutions, in a program for empowered democracy. Despite the natural affinity between modernism and leftism, according to Unger, these two movements have been separated for too long, {{to the detriment of}} transformative politics. Unger justifies empowered democracy as the system that will embody the [...] "superliberalism" [...] that Unger sees as the surest way to bring about human empowerment, in a state that is not hostage to faction and where society is an artifact of will, not a product of institutional fetishism adhering to past compromises and outmoded institutions. Unger describes the [...] "transformative movement" [...] in its quest for empowered democracy, and sketches the principles that would inform the empowered democracy as he envisions it: institutions that are less plagued by deadlock, that decentralize the exercise of power, that represent overlapping functions, and are designed to lead to swift resolution of impasse. The institutions that embody these principles include a <b>rotating</b> capital <b>fund</b> giving broad access to society's investment capital to teams of workers, a series of innovative rights (such as market rights, immunity rights, destabilization rights, and solidarity rights) that guarantee the individual's dignity, security, and right to participate fully in the economy and government of society and would be enforced by government departments charged with intervening to destabilize unjust accumulations of wealth and power.|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{the blades}} of a propeller or rotor during operation {{is crucial for}} its performance and operational saftey. Particularly the bending and twisting of the blades under load are of high interesst, because they directly influence the local angle of attack and thus {{the performance of the}} propeller. Up to now only local deformation measurements by means of strain gauges were feasible. The required cabling thereby limits the maximum number of sensors and thus avoids areal measurements. Furthermore, the application of the sensors can influence the mechanical and aerodynamic properties of the blade. A direct shape or location measurement is also not possible with those techniques. The presented measurement method IPCT (Image Pattern Correlation Technique) in addition with the application of the newly developed rotating camera system now enables the non-intrusive measurement of the shape and location of propeller- and rotor blades in-flight with a high accuracy. In the beginning of the paper, the measurement technique and the rotating camera are outlined. Later, the performed ground tests and the conducted flight test activities are described and first measurement results are shown. The major part of the development of the <b>rotating</b> camera was <b>funded</b> by the European Commission within the FP 7 project AIM 2...|$|R
