40|$|Pipe flange {{connections}} with gaskets in chemical plants, electric {{power plants and}} other industrial plants are usually exposed to elevated internal pressure with cyclic thermal condition. It is important to investigate the sealing performance of pipe connections under long term severe thermal exposure swings to ensure operational safety. In this study, the effects of cyclic thermal conditions on the sealing performance and mechanical characteristics in larger and smaller nominal diameter of pipe flange connection are examined using FEM calculations. Helium gas leakage is predicted using the contact gasket stress obtained from the FEM results. On other hand, the leakage tests using the smaller nominal diameter of pipe flange connection were conducted to measure the amount of helium gas leakage and to compare with the predicted amount of gas leakage. As the results, the contact gasket stress distributions were changed dramatically under cyclic thermal condition and elevated internal pressure. In the pipe {{flange connections}} with smaller nominal diameter, the contact gasket stress was the smallest in the <b>restart</b> <b>condition.</b> On other hand, the minimum contact gasket stress in the pipe flange connection with larger nominal diameter was depending on the materials of connection.

40|$|Stuck {{fermentation}} is a {{major problem}} in winemaking, resulting in large losses in the wine industry. Specific starter yeasts are used to restart stuck fermentations in conditions determined essentially on the basis of empirical know-how. We have developed a model synthetic stuck wine and an industrial process-based procedure for restarting fermentations, for studies of the <b>conditions</b> required to <b>restart</b> stuck fermentations. We used a basic medium containing 13. 5 % v/v ethanol and 16 g/L fructose, pH 3. 3, to test the effect of various nutrients (vitamins, amino acids, minerals, oligoelements), with the aim of developing a representative and discriminative stuck fermentation model. Cell growth appeared to be a key factor for the efficient restarting of stuck fermentations. Micronutrients, such as vitamins, also strongly affected the efficiency of the restart procedure. For the validation of this medium, we compared the performances of three wine yeast strains in the synthetic stuck fermentation and three naturally stuck wine fermentations. Strain performance was ranked similar in the synthetic medium and in the "Malbec" and "Sauvignon" natural stuck wines. However, two strains were ranked differently in the "Gros Manseng" stuck wine.

40|$|Normal {{operation}} of PWR generates corrosion and wear {{products in the}} primary circuit which are activated in the core and constitute {{the major source of}} the radiation field. In addition, cases of fuel failure and alpha emitter dissemination in the coolant system could represent a significant radiological risk. Radiation field and alpha risks are the main constraints to carry out maintenance and to handle effluents. To minimize these risks and constraints, it is essential to understand the behavior of corrosion products and actinides and to carry out the appropriate measurements in PWR circuits and loop experiments. As a matter of fact, it is more than necessary to develop and use a reactor contamination assessment code in order {{to take into account the}} chemical and physical mechanisms in different situations in operating reactors or at design stage. OSCAR code has actually been developed and used for this aim. It is presented in this paper, as well as its use in the engineering studies at EDF. To begin with, the code structure is described, including the physical, chemical and transport phenomena considered for the simulation of the mechanisms regarding PWR contamination. Then, the use of OSCAR is illustrated with two examples from our engineering studies. The first example of OSCAR engineering studies is linked to the behavior of the activated corrosion products. The selected example carefully explores the impact of the <b>restart</b> <b>conditions</b> following a reactor mid-cycle shutdown on circuit contamination.

We show here that early replication intermediates containing replication forks stalled in vitro by the accumulation of excess positive supercoils could be cleaved by the Holliday junction resolvases RusA and RuvC. Cleavage by RusA was inhibited by the presence of RuvA and was stimulated by RecG, confirming the presence of Holliday junctions in the replication intermediate and supporting the previous proposal that RecG could catalyze nascent strand regression at stalled replication forks. Furthermore, RecG promoted Holliday junction formation when replication intermediates in which the replisome had been inactivated were negatively supercoiled, suggesting that under intracellular conditions, the action of RecG, or helicases with similar activities, is necessary for the catalysis of nascent strand regression...|$|R

[...] Since the disastrous nuclear incident in Fukushima in 2011, all nuclear power stations in Japan have been shut down.

The increasing cost of electricity may hurt businesses in the country, and hamper the country from boosting its economy. But Shigeru Ishiba said that people were noticing that electricity could be supplied without nuclear power generation. Thus, restarting the reactors is still controversial: a nationwide poll showed that 76 percent either opposed nuclear power or wanted Japan to reduce the reliance on nuclear energy, while in some regions such as communities close to Sendai city, where nuclear power plants create jobs and relating subsidies are granted, restarting the reactors is widely supported.

40|$|Randomized {{algorithms}} sometimes {{employ a}} restart strategy. After {{a certain number}} of steps, the current computation is aborted and restarted with a new, independent random seed. In some cases, this results in an improved overall expected runtime. This work introduces properties of the underlying runtime distribution which determine whether restarts are advantageous. The most commonly used probability distributions admit the use of a scale and a location parameter. Location parameters shift the density function to the right, while scale parameters affect the spread of the distribution. It is shown that for all distributions scale parameters do not influence the usefulness of restarts and that location parameters only have a limited influence. This result simplifies the analysis of the usefulness of restarts. The most important runtime probability distributions are the log-normal, the Weibull, and the Pareto distribution. In this work, these distributions are analyzed for the usefulness of <b>restarts.</b> Secondly, a <b>condition</b> for the optimal restart time (if it exists) is provided.

40|$|Abstract. Given {{a generic}} Lagrangian system, its Euler–Lagrange {{operator}} obeys Noether identities which {{need not be}} independent, but satisfy first-stage Noether identities, and so on. We generalize this construction to a generic differential operator on a smooth fiber bundle. Namely, if a certain condition holds, one can associate to a differential operator the exact chain complex with the boundary operator whose nilpotency <b>condition</b> <b>restarts</b> all the Noether identities characterizing the degeneracy of this operator. Given a generic Lagrangian system, its Euler–Lagrange operator E obeys the Noether identities which need not be independent, but satisfy the first-stage Noether identities, and so on. This hierarchy of Noether identities characterizes the degeneracy of a Lagrangian system in full. Noether’s second theorem states the relation between Noether identities and gauge symmetries of a Lagrangian [1, 2], but Noether identities can be introduced without regarding E as an Euler–Lagrange operator. Therefore, one can extend the notion of Noether and higher-stage Noether identities to an arbitrary differential operator on a fiber bundle. They are defined as homology of some chain complexes (Definitions 2, 4 and 10). Let Y → X be a smooth fiber bundle and J r Y, r = 1, [...] ., the jet manifolds of its sections (the index r = 0 usually stands for Y). Let E → X be a vector bundle. A E-valued r-order differential operator E on Y is conventionally defined as a bundle morphism of J r Y to E over X [3, 4]. We associate to E the exact chain Koszul–Tate complex (38) with the boundary operator (37) whose nilpotency <b>condition</b> (39) <b>restarts</b> all the Noether identities characterizing the degeneracy of this operator.
