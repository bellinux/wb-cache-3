5000|$|The {{shipyard}} {{was founded}} in 1922. Initially, it was a profit making institution which continued after the independence of Bangladesh. But, it experienced a period of loss starting from the nineties. As a result, it was laid off in 2002. In 7 December 2007, the yard was {{handed over to the}} Bangladesh Navy. From then, it is <b>regaining</b> its <b>standard.</b> [...] This shipyard has constructed the Pabna Class riverine patrol boats from 1972 to 1977, which are the first Bangladesh made warships..|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{report the}} {{structural}} and electrical properties of ion beam sputtered ZnO films vacuum annealed at varying temperatures. XRD {{results revealed that}} the films grow along the c-axis. The crystallite sizes increase from ~ 8 to ~ 30 nm upon annealing at 800 ºC. Annealing aided to recover the compressive strain and <b>regain</b> the <b>standard</b> lattice parameter values. The RMS surface roughness increased to ~ 5. 0 nm after annealing at 800 ºC as observed in AFM micrographs. Increased resistivity on the annealed films suggested that the oxygen vacancies are compensated by de-trapped oxygen at grain boundaries...|$|R

50|$|It {{was thought}} that by {{creating}} a new <b>standard,</b> IBM would <b>regain</b> control of <b>standards</b> via the required licensing. As patents can take three years or more to be granted, however, only those relating to ISA could be licensed when Micro Channel was announced. Patents on important Micro Channel features, such as Plug and Play automatic configuration, were not granted to IBM until after PCI had replaced Micro Channel in the marketplace.|$|R
50|$|Some {{sections}} {{of the rest of}} the route are of lower standard than that of those further east. Some traffic leaves for major holiday destinations such as Caernarfon or the Llŷn Peninsula, though much continues on to the port of Holyhead. As such part of the route is not classed as clearway and has two at grade junctions (roundabouts), Penmaenmawr (Junction 16) and Llanfairfechan (Junction 15). The Bangor bypass, in which the road previously terminated and became the A5 <b>regains</b> high <b>standards</b> and is such through the Anglesey section, bar the Britannia Bridge, which is a single carriageway deck above the North Wales Coast railway over the Menai Strait. In 2007 the Welsh Assembly Government undertook a consultation to determine which of four options would be preferred for a second crossing. This section intersects with the A487 towards Caernarfon, and the west coast of North Wales.|$|R

40|$|In {{looking for}} {{imprints}} of extra dimensions in brane world models one usually builts these {{so that they}} are compatible with known low energy physics and thus focuses on high energy effects. Nevertheless, just as submillimeter Newton's law tests probe the mode structure of gravity other low energy tests might apply to matter. As a model example, in this work we determine the 4 D Casimir force corresponding to a scalar field subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions on two parallel planes lying within the single brane of a Randall-Sundrum scenario extended by one compact extra dimension. Using the Green's function method such a force picks the contribution of each field mode as if it acted individually but with a weight given by the square of the mode wave functions on the brane. In the low energy regime one <b>regains</b> the <b>standard</b> 4 D Casimir force that is associated to a zero mode in the massless case or to a quasilocalized or resonant mode in the massive one whilst the effect of the extra dimensions gets encoded as an additional term.

40|$|SUMMARY National External Quality Assessment Scheme surveys on the {{prothrombin}} time test {{carried out in}} hospitals in the United Kingdom have been performed at regular intervals since 1972. Performance has been assessed by comparing observed variability between hospitals with that predicted by a statistical model. The model was based on results from 53 survey plasmas issued between 1980 and 1987. These showed a linear correlation between logarithms of nean and standard deviation of reported ratios. Precision improved until the human brain thromboplastin, Manchester Comparative Reagent, was withdrawn in January 1986. There then followed a pronounced overall deterioration which, by October 1987, had not corrected to the levels achieved by 1985. When the recent results from 1986 - 87 were analysed according to Quick test reagent only one reagent (ISI 1 1) showed an improvement in precision. Performance of the other Quick test reagents, all with higher ISI values, had not <b>regained</b> the <b>standards</b> of precision previously achieved by the human brain reagent. This study was prompted {{by the need to}} investigate the effects on precision of the {{prothrombin time}} test resulting from the withdrawal ofhuman brain throm...|$|R
50|$|In 17/16 BC Lollius was {{appointed}} by Augustus as Roman governor of Gaul. During his governorship, {{he was responsible for}} several legions who guarded the Rhine river. His legions were defeated by the Germanic tribes the Sicambri, Tencteri and Usipetes, who had crossed the Rhine. The military defeat that Lollius suffered, known as the clades Lolliana, is coupled by Suetonius with the disaster of Publius Quinctilius Varus, but it was disgraceful rather than dangerous. Augustus dispatched his step-son Tiberius to rectify the situation and to <b>regain</b> the captured <b>standard</b> of the Legio V Macedonica. On the arrival of Tiberius, the Germanic tribes retired beyond the Rhine. Although the political and military career of Lollius suffered, and he never again {{was appointed}} as commander of an army, he remained on friendly terms with Augustus.|$|R
50|$|With the {{elimination}} of compulsory figures—formerly Trenary's strength—from competition, the technical standard for jumping in women's skating had risen greatly, with the top skaters all attempting five or six different triples. Trenary's injury was slow to heal and she had problems <b>regaining</b> her former <b>standard</b> of jumps, much less learning new ones. She planned to compete at the 1992 U.S. Championships, beginning her comeback in fall 1991 at Skate Canada, where she {{finished second in the}} short program to Surya Bonaly, but dropped to fourth overall after the long program, where she was unable to successfully land any triple jumps. She qualified for the 1992 U.S. Nationals by winning the 1991 Midwestern Sectional Championships with an uneven performance: after a strong short program in which she landed a triple flip combination, she was unable to land any triple jumps in the long program. She ended her bid to qualify for the 1992 Winter Olympics in December 1991.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{establishing}} quantification methods for binary mixtures containing a new polypropylene/polyamide 6 - based bicomponent fibre, for which a new generic fibre name has been requested to the European Commission. Application of such methods is requested by EU legislation (Directive 96 / 73 /EC) to enable market surveillance regarding the textile composition data on labels that are compulsory. The methodology for quantification of fibre mixtures is usually based either on manual separation or on chemical dissolution methods. In both cases, a sample pre-treatment, able to remove non-fibrous material, is needed. The key experimental parameters {{that need to be}} established for the novel fibre are: its moisture <b>regain</b> in <b>standard</b> atmosphere (agreed allowance), its mass loss due to pre-treatment (b coefficient) and its mass losses in the methods where it is insoluble (d correction factors). Results of this study showed that the b coefficient for the new fibre, using the normal pre-treatment, is equal to 0 %. As expected from the chemical composition and synthetic character of the novel fibre, the experimental value for the agreed allowance was low and equal to 0. 54 %. The new fibre was insoluble in ten out of the 14 dissolution methods tested and the correspondent ten d correction factors were evaluated. Three of them were also validated through a collaborative trial organised at European level following the internationally accepted guideline ISO 5725 - 2 : 1994. The d correction factors obtained throughout the study were in the range of 1. 00 - 1. 01, meaning that the fibre was completely insoluble or at maximum 1 % soluble in the dissolution reagent. Based on the results of this study, laboratories across the EU and beyond have now at their disposal methods to quantify the new fibre in binary mixtures with polyester, elastomultiester, polyamide, chlorofibres, certain acrylic and modacrylic fibres, acetate, triacetate, polylactide, certain cellulose fibres and certain protein fibres.

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the First World War, the British imposed a blockade against Germany intending to prevent all imports from entering the country. Germans began to call the British naval action the Hungerblockade, claiming that it seriously damaged the well-being of those on the home front, namely women and children, through lack of adequate nutrition. These German claims that Britain used hunger as a weapon of war against civilians have sometimes been dismissed as propaganda. However, newly discovered anthropometric measurements made of German school children during the war gives credence to German contentions that the blockade inflicted severe deprivation on children and other non-combatants. Further, these data show that the blockade exacerbated existing nutritional inequalities between children of different social classes; working class children suffered the most profound effects of nutritional deprivation during the war. Once the blockade ended however, working class children were the quickest to recover, <b>regaining</b> their pre-War <b>standards</b> in weight by 1921. They surpassed their own pre-War height standards by 1923, and approximated the weight of middle class children by 1924. This recovery of working class children is likely due to the outpouring of international aid targeted at poor German children. These data also indicate significant gender inequalities starting at age fourteen in nutritional status, with male adolescents suffering far greater deprivation from 1914 - 1924. ...|$|R
