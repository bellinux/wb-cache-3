5|$|Radiocarbon {{dates are}} {{generally}} {{presented with a}} range of one standard deviation (usually represented by the Greek letter sigma as 1σ) {{on either side of the}} mean. However, a date range of 1σ represents only 68% confidence level, so the true age of the object being measured may lie outside the range of dates quoted. This was demonstrated in 1970 by an experiment run by the British Museum radiocarbon laboratory, in which weekly measurements were taken on the same sample for six months. The results varied widely (though consistently with a normal distribution of errors in the measurements), and included multiple date ranges (of 1σ confidence) that did not overlap with each other. The measurements included one with a <b>range</b> <b>from</b> <b>about</b> 4250 to about 4390 years ago, and another with a <b>range</b> <b>from</b> <b>about</b> 4520 to about 4690.|$|E

5|$|By 1978, nine {{distinct}} rings were identified. Two additional rings {{were discovered}} in 1986 in images taken by the Voyager 2 spacecraft, and two outer rings were found in 2003–2005 in Hubble Space Telescope photos. In the order of increasing distance from the planet the 13 known rings are designated 1986U2R/ζ, 6, 5, 4, α, β, η, γ, δ, λ, ε, ν and μ. Their radii <b>range</b> <b>from</b> <b>about</b> 38,000km for the 1986U2R/ζ ring to about 98,000km for the μ ring. Additional faint dust bands and incomplete arcs may exist between the main rings.

5|$|The naphtha cut, as that {{fraction}} is called, {{contains many}} different hydrocarbon compounds. Therefore, {{it has an}} initial boiling point of about 35°C and a final boiling point of about 200°C. Each cut produced in the fractionating columns has a different boiling range. At some distance below the overhead, the next cut is withdrawn {{from the side of}} the column and it is usually the jet fuel cut, also known as a kerosene cut. The boiling range of that cut is from an initial boiling point of about 150°C to a final boiling point of about 270°C, and it also contains many different hydrocarbons. The next cut further down the tower is the diesel oil cut with a boiling <b>range</b> <b>from</b> <b>about</b> 180°C to about 315°C. The boiling ranges between any cut and the next cut overlap because the distillation separations are not perfectly sharp. After these come the heavy fuel oil cuts and finally the bottoms product, with very wide boiling ranges. All these cuts are processed further in subsequent refining processes.|$|E

General Władysław Sikorski, Polish commander-in-chief and prime minister, was able to evacuate many Polish troops to the United Kingdom (estimates <b>range</b> <b>from</b> <b>about</b> 20,000 to 35,000), where a new Polish army was formed.

25|$|Recyclability is a {{key factor}} of a {{sustainable}} material. It reduces the need to mine new resources and requires less energy than mining. Copper and its alloys are virtually 100% recyclable and can be recycled infinitely without any loss of quality (i.e., copper does not degrade (i.e., downcycle) after each recycling loop as do most non-metallic materials, if they are recyclable at all). Copper retains much of its primary metal value: premium-grade scrap normally contains at least 95% {{of the value of}} primary metal from newly mined ore. Scrap values for competing materials <b>range</b> <b>from</b> <b>about</b> 60% down to 0%. And copper recycling requires only around 20% of the energy needed to extract and process primary metal.|$|E

25|$|These stars, {{known as}} neutron stars, are {{extremely}} small—on {{the order of}} radius 10km, no bigger than {{the size of a}} large city—and are phenomenally dense. Their period of rotation shortens dramatically as the stars shrink (due to conservation of angular momentum); observed rotational periods of neutron stars <b>range</b> <b>from</b> <b>about</b> 1.5 milliseconds (over 600 revolutions per second) to several seconds. When these rapidly rotating stars' magnetic poles are aligned with the Earth, we detect a pulse of radiation each revolution. Such neutron stars are called pulsars, and were the first neutron stars to be discovered. Though electromagnetic radiation detected from pulsars is most often in the form of radio waves, pulsars have also been detected at visible, X-ray, and gamma ray wavelengths.|$|E

The NKVD, supplying the Russian perspective, gives the statistic of 144,704 killed in 1944–1948 alone (with a death rate of 23.5% for all groups).

25|$|Pigments appear {{the colors}} they are because they {{selectively}} reflect and absorb certain wavelengths of visible light. White light is a roughly equal {{mixture of the}} entire spectrum of visible light with a wavelength in a <b>range</b> <b>from</b> <b>about</b> 375 or 400 nanometers to about 760 or 780nm. When this light encounters a pigment, parts of the spectrum are absorbed by the molecules or ions of the pigment. In organic pigments such as diazo or phthalocyanine compounds the light is absorbed by the conjugated systems of double bonds in the molecule. Some of the inorganic pigments such as vermilion (mercury sulfide) or cadmium yellow (cadmium sulfide) absorb light by transferring an electron from the negative ion (S2−) to the positive ion (Hg2+ or Cd2+). Such compounds are designated as charge-transfer complexes, with broad absorption bands that subtract most of {{the colors of the}} incident white light. The other wavelengths or parts of the spectrum are reflected or scattered. The new reflected light spectrum creates the appearance of a color. Pigments, unlike fluorescent or phosphorescent substances, can only subtract wavelengths from the source light, never add new ones.|$|E
