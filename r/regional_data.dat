25|$|However, an {{analysis}} by the <b>Regional</b> <b>Data</b> Cooperative for Greater New Haven, Inc., has shown that due to issues of comparative denominators and other factors, such municipality-based rankings can be considered inaccurate. For example, two cities of identical population can cover widely differing land areas, making such analyses irrelevant. The research organization called for comparisons based on neighborhoods, blocks, or standard methodologies (similar to those used by Brookings, DiversityData, and other established institutions), not based on municipalities.|$|E

25|$|A common {{understanding}} exists {{that in the}} national level HOV model fits well. In fact, Davis and others found that HOV model fitted extremely well with the <b>regional</b> <b>data</b> of Japan. Even when the HOV formula fits well, {{it does not mean}} that Heckscher–Ohlin theory is valid. Indeed, Heckscher–Ohlin theory claims that the state of factor endowments of each country (or each region) determines the production of each country (respectively of each region) but Bernstein and Weinstein found that the factor endowments have little predictive power. The factor-endowments-driven model (FED model) has errors much greater than the HOV model.|$|E
500|$|The Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting (HWRF) {{model is}} a {{specialized}} version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and is used to forecast the track and intensity of tropical cyclones. The model {{was developed by the}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, the University of Rhode Island, and Florida State University. It became operational in 2007. [...] Despite improvements in track forecasting, predictions of the intensity of a tropical cyclone based on numerical weather prediction continue to be a challenge, since statiscal methods continue to show higher skill over dynamical guidance. Other than the specialized guidance, global guidance such as the GFS, Unified Model (UKMET), NOGAPS, Japanese Global Spectral Model (GSM), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model, France's Action de Recherche Petite Echelle Grande Echelle (ARPEGE) and Aire Limit´ee Adaptation Dynamique Initialisation (ALADIN) models, India's National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMWRF) model, Korea's Global Data Assimilation and Prediction System (GDAPS) and <b>Regional</b> <b>Data</b> Assimilation and Prediction System (RDAPS) models, Hong Kong/China's Operational Regional Spectral Model (ORSM) model, and Canadian Global Environmental Multiscale Model (GEM) model are used for track and intensity purposes.|$|E

30|$|Accurate {{statistical}} data {{are essential to}} a credible and cogent empirical analysis. However, there currently is no mature and specialized methodology to evaluate the accuracy of input–output (IO) data. This research constructs a comprehensive yet relatively concise framework for evaluating the accuracy of <b>regional</b> IO <b>data</b> by including several indicators that measure all three quadrants. The framework examines <b>regional</b> IO <b>data</b> {{from the perspectives of}} time consistency and variation, coefficient correlation and its homogeneity with national-level data. A score indicating the overall accuracy and detailed information that presents concrete shortcomings of <b>regional</b> IO <b>data</b> could be offered after analysis using this framework. As an example, the provincial-level IO data for 30 provinces for 3  years (2002, 2007 and 2012) are analyzed by this framework, and possible explanations of the results are offered. The main contribution and innovation of this research is the construction of an applicable and exhaustive quality evaluation framework for <b>regional</b> IO <b>data.</b> This framework enables researchers to realize flaws in IO data before utilizing them. It also allows government agencies {{to improve the quality of}} their data by avoiding issues that emerged in previous data quality evaluations.|$|R

40|$|Brief physical-geographical characteristics, {{history of}} {{creation}} {{and development of the}} Mordovia State Nature Reserve territory are presented. We listed aims and objectives assigned for the Mordovia Reserve in different periods. During {{the first years of the}} Mordovia Reserve the forest conservation was aimed at reforestation of the southern area of the taiga zone; the investigation of harmful insect fauna to timely response on infection foci of trees; enriching of the fauna of the Reserve. At present, the Reserve should have an ecological-educational value in addition to the value of nature conservation. The article presents the modern period of scientific investigations and the development of the Mordovia Reserve territory. Also, it contains data on the species number of flora and fauna, including those listed in the Red Book of the Republic of Mordovia (2003, 2005) and of the Russian Federation (2001, 2008). Due to the geographical location on the border of three natural zones and a high degree of knowledge of the Mordovia State Nature Reserve, there are noted 344 macromycetes (including 1 species listed in the Red Book of Russian Federation, 15 species included in the main list of the <b>regional</b> Red <b>Data</b> Book); 361 lichens (including 3 species included in the Red Book of Russia and 24 species from the main list of the <b>regional</b> Red <b>Data</b> Book); more than 100 mosses (including 7 species from the main list of the <b>regional</b> Red <b>Data</b> Book); 796 vascular plants (including 3 species from the IUCN list, 3 species included in the Red Book of Russian Federation and 46 species from the main list of the <b>regional</b> Red <b>Data</b> Book); more than 4500 insects (including 11 species from the IUCN list, 11 species from the Red Book of Russian Federation and 53 species from the main list of the <b>regional</b> Red <b>Data</b> Book); 32 fishes (including 1 species from the Red Book of Russian Federation and 11 species included in the main list of the <b>regional</b> Red <b>Data</b> Book); 11 amphibians (including 4 species from the main list of the Red Book of the Republic of Mordovia); 7 reptiles (including 3 species from the Red Book of the Republic of Mordovia); 222 birds (including 2 species from the IUCN list, 20 species included in the Red Book of Russia, and 69 species from the main list of the <b>regional</b> Red <b>Data</b> Book); 65 mammals (including 1 species from the Red Book of Russian Federation and 23 species included in the main list of the <b>regional</b> Red <b>Data</b> Book).
