The National Assembly itself {{is divided into two}} houses: the lower House of Representatives and the upper Council of the Republic. While each house has its own <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> how members are elected, members decide on the various bills that could become Belarusian law and approve the {{nominations}} of cabinet heads that the president chooses.|$|E
5|$|David I {{established}} the first chartered burghs in Scotland, copying the burgher charters and Leges Burgorum (<b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> virtually {{every aspect of}} life and work) almost verbatim from the English customs of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne. Early burgesses were usually Flemish, English, French and German, rather than Gaelic Scots. The burgh's vocabulary was composed totally of either Germanic and French terms. The councils that ran individual burghs were individually known as lie doussane, meaning the dozen.|$|E
5|$|Senator McCarthy's zeal {{to uncover}} {{subversion}} and espionage led to disturbing excesses. His browbeating tactics destroyed careers {{of people who}} were not involved in the infiltration of our government. His freewheeling style caused both the Senate and the Subcommittee to revise the <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> future investigations, and prompted the courts to act to protect the Constitutional rights of witnesses at Congressional hearings.... These hearings are a part of our national past that we can neither afford to forget nor permit to reoccur.|$|E

5|$|The {{organization}} {{has been criticized}} for issues relating to the Catholic Church, especially the practice of mortification of the flesh. Controversies about Opus Dei have centered around criticisms of its behaviours, such as alleged secretiveness, aggressive recruiting methods, and its strict <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> members. The organization's members have also been categorized by critics as left-leaning elitists, with some individuals supporting fascist governments, such as the Francoist Government of Spain until 1978.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{informal}} <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> fighting in ice hockey that players rarely discuss but take quite seriously. The {{most important aspect}} of this etiquette is that opposing enforcers must agree to a fight, usually via a verbal or physical exchange on the ice. This agreement helps both players avoid being given an instigator penalty, and helps keep unwilling participants out of fights.|$|E
5|$|The NPVIC {{does not}} include any {{provision}} for a nationwide recount {{in the event that}} the vote tally is in dispute. While each state has established <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> recounts {{in the event of a}} close or disputed statewide tally, it is possible for the national vote to be close without there being a close result in any one state. Proponents of the compact argue that the need for a recount would be less likely under a national popular vote than under the current electoral system.|$|E

5|$|The {{rules of}} chess (also {{known as the}} laws of chess) are <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> the {{play of the game}} of chess. While the exact origins of chess are unclear, modern rules first took form during the Middle Ages. The rules {{continued}} to be slightly modified until the early 19th century, when they reached essentially their current form. The rules also varied somewhat from place to place. Today, the standard rules are set by FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs), the international governing body for chess. Slight modifications are made by some national organizations for their own purposes. There are variations of the rules for fast chess, correspondence chess, online chess, and Chess960.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{constitutional}} <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> protocol {{in the event}} of a hung parliament, Brown, as the sitting Prime Minister, would remain in office until a new government could be formed, a process which could continue without resolution until the State Opening of Parliament, which was scheduled for 25 May. On Brown's instructions, Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell had updated the protocol for dealing with a hung parliament earlier in the year. Following confirmation that no party had achieved an overall majority, Brown authorised O'Donnell to begin the process. Four-member teams of civil servants were sent to liaise with the main political parties to facilitate negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{some other}} {{classical}} figures (Comte, Durkheim) Weber did not attempt, consciously, to create any {{specific set of}} <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> social sciences in general, or sociology in particular. In comparison with Durkheim and Marx, Weber was more focused on individuals and culture and this is clear in his methodology. Whereas Durkheim focused on the society, Weber concentrated on the individuals and their actions (see structure and action discussion) and whereas Marx argued for {{the primacy of the}} material world over the world of ideas, Weber valued ideas as motivating actions of individuals, at least in the big picture.|$|E

During the National Day celebrations period (1 July – 30 September), <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> the flying of the national flag outside buildings are relaxed. The flag may be displayed on any vehicle (other than a hearse), vessel or aircraft, and may be incorporated as part of any costume or attire, so long as this is done in a respectful manner.|$|E
5|$|Combs {{created a}} merit system for state {{government}} workers, ensuring that officials {{could not be}} hired or fired for political reasons. This provision attracted more well-qualified people to public service careers. Such careers were made even more attractive when, in 1962, the state courts declared that the salaries of state employees, the amounts of which were specified in the state constitution, could be adjusted for inflation. Combs demanded that state employees stick strictly to the <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> their offices. In one instance, Combs ordered a state audit of Carter County superintendent Heman McGuire, who was known to use his office for political gain. While Combs {{did not have the}} authority to remove McGuire directly, the audit showed McGuire's misappropriation of funds and abuse of power. The state school board investigated these findings and removed the county school board members from office; the replacement board members then ousted McGuire.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his formal studies, Blackstone published a collection of poetry which included the draft version of The Lawyer to his Muse, his most famous literary work. In 1743 he published Elements of Architecture and An Abridgement of Architecture, two treatises on the <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> the art of construction. His next work (1747) was The Pantheon: A Vision, an anonymously published book of poetry covering the various religions in the world. It depicts a narrator's walking dream through the buildings of various religions, which are all (other than Christianity) depicted in a negative light. This followed his election as a Fellow of All Souls, Oxford on 2 November 1743, and his call to the Bar by the Middle Temple on 28 November 1746.|$|E

5|$|Plato, in his Laws, {{set forth}} rules that governed not the ideal state, which he {{described}} in The Republic, but what he felt might be obtainable in the real world. Included amongst them were some dealing with inheritance and heiresses. In general outline, they conformed to Athenian practice, with {{the daughter of a}} man who died without male heirs becoming an epikleros. Plato gave <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> who the husband of the epikleros might be, and said that the inherited plot might not be divided or added to another plot. The main departure from Athenian law came if there was no direct heir, and the inheritance go to collateral relations. In that case, Plato assigned the inheritance not to one person, but to a pair, one male and one female, and ordered that they must marry and provide an heir to the estate, much like the epikleros.|$|E
5|$|The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences {{has given}} Academy Awards to foreign {{language}} films since 1945. The Academy defines {{a foreign language}} film as a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. Films that meet these criteria are eligible for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. They can be nominated for awards in categories other than Best Foreign Language Film provided {{that they have been}} commercially released in Los Angeles County and comply with the special <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> those categories. In addition, foreign-language films produced in the United States are not eligible for Best Foreign Language Film, but are eligible for awards in other categories.|$|E
5|$|The Nebula Awards {{annually}} {{recognize the}} best works {{of science fiction}} or fantasy published in the United States. The awards are organized and awarded by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA), a nonprofit association of professional science fiction and fantasy writers. They were first given in 1966 at a ceremony created for the awards, and are given in four categories for different lengths of literary works. A fifth category for film and television episode scripts was given 1974–78 and 2000–09. The <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> the Nebula Awards have changed {{several times during the}} awards' history, most recently in 2010. The SFWA Nebula Conference, at which the awards are announced and presented, is held each spring in the United States. Locations vary from year to year.|$|E

5|$|The Primera Junta {{was finally}} established. It was {{composed}} by president Cornelio Saavedra, members Manuel Alberti, Miguel de Azcuénaga, Manuel Belgrano, Juan José Castelli, Domingo Matheu and Juan Larrea, and secretaries Juan José Paso and Mariano Moreno. The <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> it were {{roughly the same}} as those issued the day before, with the additional provisions that the Cabildo would watch over the members of the Junta and that the Junta itself would appoint replacements in case of vacancies. Saavedra spoke to the crowd, and then moved on to the Fort, among salvos of artillery and the ringing of bells. Meanwhile, Cisneros dispatched a post rider to Córdoba, Argentina, to warn Santiago de Liniers about what had happened in Buenos Aires and to request military action against the Junta.|$|E
5|$|Urobuchi {{stated that}} Sayaka was his {{favorite}} character overall, and remarked that her plotline was the most enjoyable to write. Due to her grim fate {{by the end of}} the series, a destiny that Shinbo believed was slightly unfair, he asked Urobuchi if it was possible to change the plot so that Sayaka could be spared. Urobuchi declined, asserting that her death was too integral to the overarching story. Shinbo then inquired if there were any way that she could be brought back to life, admitting he had become very attached to the character. However, Urobuchi again refused, explaining that this would be impossible with regard to the already-established <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> the story. Shinbo finally acquiesced to this, but remarked that he believed there may have been too large of a burden placed on the characters who were in essence young middle school girls.|$|E
5|$|After John Myers' {{recommendations}} of a regulatory overhaul in commercial radio were published, and the Digital Economy Act 2010 allowing stations to co-locate or discontinue local shows and to broadcast on national DAB was passed, Smooth Radio merged its five English stations into one quasi-national station, and local news feeds were produced from GMG Radio's headquarters in Salford Quays. GMG Radio announced on 29 June 2010 that {{it wanted to}} compete with BBC Radio 2 by broadcasting on the Digital One multiplex on DAB to the whole of England and Wales, and Sky, Freesat, Freeview, Virgin Media and online. Regional content would be kept; split news, travel and weather bulletins would be broadcast on the FM and regional DAB stations in the North East, North West, West Midlands and East Midlands. Listeners in London and those tuning to the national output would hear national information. 105.2 Smooth Radio in Scotland would keep its local breakfast and drivetime programmes because of the <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> its broadcast licence, but networked content would be broadcast {{the rest of the}} time. The jazz commitments for London and the North West were also ended. The new Smooth Radio was launched on 4 October 2010 with most of the output originating from Salford Quays, and other programming coming from London.|$|E
