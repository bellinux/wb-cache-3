For their part, Minh's leadership group believed that a more low-key military approach was needed for their political campaign against the insurgency.|$|E

5|$|By 1965, the Americans {{were looking}} for someone to {{overthrow}} Khánh, and these efforts were spearheaded by Ambassador Maxwell Taylor, who had begun encouraging other senior officers to move against Khánh {{since the start of the}} year, even though there was still significant hesitation and opposition to any <b>regime</b> <b>change</b> back in Washington. At the time, the US was planning to start a large-scale bombing campaign against the communist north and regarded Khánh's reliance on Buddhist support as an obstacle to their aims. Furthermore, Taylor and Khánh developed an intense personal antipathy for one another, which culminated in a breakdown in their relationship; in December 1964, Khánh's junta deposed the High National Council, a civilian advisory body that was designed to give a semblance of civilian rule. This resulted in Taylor angrily condemning Khánh and his generals in private to the point of suggesting Khánh resign the leadership. Khánh responded by threatening to expel Taylor, and going on a media offensive against the ambassador. Taylor threatened to withhold military aid, but the Americans could not do so because of their overriding desire to see the military defeat of the communists, and without foreign funding, South Vietnam could not survive.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the Young Turks' press conference, Taylor privately met Khánh at the latter's office. He complained about the {{dissolution}} of the HNC and said it did not accord with the values of the alliance and the loyalty Washington expected of Saigon. He added that the US could not cooperate with two governments at once: a military regime that held power while a civilian body took the responsibility. Khánh testily replied that Vietnam was not a satellite of the US and compared the situation to the US support of the successful coup against Diệm, saying that loyalty was meant to be reciprocated. Khánh had hinted that he felt the Americans were about to have him deposed like Diệm, who was then assassinated, but this rankled Taylor, who had argued against the <b>regime</b> <b>change.</b> Taylor then bemoaned Khánh, saying he had lost confidence in the Vietnamese officer, recommending Khánh resign and go into exile. He also said military supplies currently being shipped to Vietnam would be withheld after arriving in Saigon and that American help in planning and advising military operations would be suspended.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{validity}} of uncovered interest-rate parity by constructing ultra-long time series that span two centuries. The forward-premium regressions yield positive slope estimates over the whole sample. The estimates become negative only when the sample {{is dominated by the}} period of 1980 s. We also find that large interest-rate differentials have significantly stronger forecasting powers for currency movements than small interest-rate differentials. Furthermore, when we regress domestic currency returns on foreign bonds against returns on domestic bonds as an alternative test of the parity condition, the null hypotheses of zero intercept and unit slope cannot be rejected in most cases. These results are consistent with a world in which expectations formation is highly imperfect and characterized on the one hand by slow adjustment of expectations to actual <b>regime</b> <b>changes</b> and on the other by anticipations for extended periods of <b>regime</b> <b>changes</b> or other big events that never materialize. An historical account of expected and realized <b>regime</b> <b>changes</b> adds credence to this explanation and illustrates how uncovered interest-rate parity holds over the very long haul but nevertheless can be deviated from {{over long periods of time}} due to ex post-expectation errors.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{modeling}} and {{the classification of}} functional data presenting <b>regime</b> <b>changes</b> over time. We propose a new model-based functional mixture discriminant analysis approach based on a specific hidden process regression model that governs the <b>regime</b> <b>changes</b> over time. Our approach is particularly adapted to handle the problem of complex-shaped classes of curves, where each class is potentially composed of several sub-classes, {{and to deal with}} the <b>regime</b> <b>changes</b> within each homogeneous sub-class. The proposed model explicitly integrates the heterogeneity of each class of curves via a mixture model formulation, and the <b>regime</b> <b>changes</b> within each sub-class through a hidden logistic process. Each class of complex-shaped curves is modeled by a finite number of homogeneous clusters, each of them being decomposed into several regimes. The model parameters of each class are learned by maximizing the observed-data log-likelihood by using a dedicated expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Comparisons are performed with alternative curve classification approaches, including functional linear discriminant analysis and functional mixture discriminant analysis with polynomial regression mixtures and spline regression mixtures. Results obtained on simulated data and real data show that the proposed approach outperforms the alternative approaches in terms of discrimination, and significantly improves the curves approximation...|$|R
40|$|Wildfires {{have played}} a {{determining}} role in distribution, composition and structure of many ecosystems worldwide and climatic changes are widely {{considered to be a}} major driver of future fire <b>regime</b> <b>changes.</b> However, forecasting future climatic change induced impacts on fire regimes will require a clearer understanding of other drivers of abrupt fire <b>regime</b> <b>changes.</b> Here, we focus on evidence from different environmental and temporal settings of fire <b>regimes</b> <b>changes</b> that are not directly attributed to climatic changes. We review key cases of these abrupt fire <b>regime</b> <b>changes</b> at different spatial and temporal scales, including those directly driven (i) by fauna, (ii) by invasive plant species, and (iii) by socio-economic and policy changes. All these drivers might generate non-linear effects of landscape changes in fuel structure; that is, they generate fuel changes that can cross thresholds of landscape continuity, and thus drastically change fire activity. Although climatic changes might contribute to some of these changes, there are also many instances that are not primarily linked to climatic shifts. Understanding the mechanism driving fire <b>regime</b> <b>changes</b> should contribute to our ability to better assess future fire regimes. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

40|$|Regional {{magnitudes}} {{and patterns}} of Arctic winter climate changes in consequence of <b>regime</b> <b>changes</b> of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) are analyzed using a regional atmospheric climate model. The regional model has been driven with data {{of positive and negative}} NAO phases from a control simulation as well as from a time-dependent greenhouse gas and aerosol scenario simulation. Both global model simulations include a quite realistic interannual variability of the NAO with pronounced decadal <b>regime</b> <b>changes</b> and no or rather weak long-term NAO trends. The results indicate that the effects of NAO <b>regime</b> <b>changes</b> on Arctic winter temperatures and precipitation are regionally significant over most of northwestern Eurasia and parts of Greenland. In this regard, mean winter temperature variations of up to 6 K may occur over northern Europe. Precipitation and synoptic variability are also regionally modified by NAO <b>regime</b> <b>changes,</b> but not as significantly as temperatures. However, the climate changes associated with the NAO are in some regions clearly stronger than those attributed to enhanced greenhouse gases and aerosols, indicating that projected global changes of the atmospheric composition and internal circulation changes are competing with each other in their importance for the Arctic climate evolution in the near future. The knowledge of the future NAO trend on decadal and longer time scales appears to be vitally important in terms of a regional assessment of climate scenarios for the Arctic...|$|R
