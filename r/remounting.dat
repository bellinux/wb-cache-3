5|$|In 1985, Pacino {{worked on}} his {{personal}} project, The Local Stigmatic, a 1969 Off Broadway play by the English writer Heathcote Williams. He starred in the play, <b>remounting</b> it with director David Wheeler and the Theater Company of Boston in a 50-minute film version. The film was not released theatrically, but was later released {{as part of the}} Pacino: An Actor's Vision box set in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Though Wyatt {{received}} {{bullet holes}} in both sides of his long coat and another in his boot heel, he never received even a scratch from any bullet. After emptying his shotgun, Wyatt fired his pistol, mortally wounding Johnny Barnes {{in the chest and}} wounding Milt Hicks in the arm. Vermillion tried to retrieve his rifle wedged in the scabbard under his fallen horse, exposing himself to the Cowboys' gunfire. Doc Holliday helped him get to cover. Wyatt had trouble <b>remounting</b> his horse because his cartridge belt had slipped down his legs. He was finally able to get on his horse, and {{with the rest of the}} posse retreated.|$|E
5|$|Leake had {{not brought}} many {{supplies}} to Gibraltar but provided what he could, and loaned Hesse the fleet's skilled manpower, {{of which the}} confederate garrison was desperately short. A labour force of some 500 men was assembled from the ships' companies and was put to work repairing the fortifications, <b>remounting</b> guns dislodged by Spanish fire and hauling cannon up the Rock to increase the fire being directed onto the Spanish batteries. One of those involved, Captain Willis, played such a prominent role that the track he used was renamed (and is still known as) Willis' Road, and he also gave his name to Willis' Battery (now Princess Royal's Battery), Magazine and Guard.|$|E
50|$|He {{transferred}} to the Army <b>Remount</b> Department, India on 21 September 1934 and was appointed permanently in early 1938, serving as the Assistant <b>Remount</b> Officer, Sargoda <b>Remount</b> Depot (1934-36). Later he served Shahpur Area (1937-38) and Shahpur <b>Remount</b> Depot (1939-40).|$|R

50|$|A {{part of the}} Quartermaster Corps, the U.S. Army <b>Remount</b> Service {{provided}} horses (and later mules and dogs) as <b>remounts</b> to U.S. Army units. Evolving {{from both}} the <b>Remount</b> Service of the Quartermaster Corps and a general horse-breeding program {{under the control of}} the Department of Agriculture, the <b>Remount</b> Service began systematically breeding horses for the United States Cavalry in 1918. It remained in operation until 1948, when all animal-breeding programs returned to Department of Agriculture control.|$|R

50|$|In 1942, during World War II, owner Samuel Riddle gave American Flag to the U.S. Army <b>Remount</b> Service. The twenty-year-old horse {{died that}} {{fall at the}} <b>Remount</b> station near Front Royal, Virginia.|$|R
25|$|War chariots {{were used}} by the elite, but unlike their {{counterparts}} in the Middle East, they appear to have been used for transport, with the warrior dismounting to fight on foot and then <b>remounting</b> to withdraw from combat, although some accounts show warriors throwing their spear from the chariot before dismounting.|$|E
25|$|Private Robert 'Robbie' Laws aged 18, {{and from}} 2nd Battalion The Mercian Regiment (Worcesters and Foresters) died when the FV103 Spartan {{armoured}} personnel carrier he was travelling in {{was struck by}} a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) while taking part in operation Panchai Palang on Saturday 4 July 2009. Pte Laws had been involved in a dismounted IED search team and had periodically been dismounting and <b>remounting</b> the vehicle as it stopped and started along a road. It was immediately after he had remounted and the vehicle had just moved off when it was struck.|$|E
25|$|The {{weapon was}} {{modified}} with a two-stage trigger mechanism with an adjustable pull force, a wooden buttstock that folds {{to the right}} side of the weapon and a heavy-duty bipod, mounted to the forward base of the receiver housing that folds beneath the handguard when not in use. The buttstock is fully adjustable in length and height and features a variable-height cheek riser. The rifle comes with mechanical iron sights and an adapter used to mount a telescopic day sight (Nimrod 6×40) or a night sight. The mount is quick-detachable and capable of retaining zero after <b>remounting.</b> The precision rifle is stored in a rugged transport case that comes with an optical sight, mount, filters, two slings (for carrying and firing) and a cleaning kit. Recent production models feature synthetic plastic furniture and a skeletonized metal stock.|$|E
500|$|Brown was a <b>remount</b> agent, {{who served}} on the U.S. <b>Remount</b> Board, and his {{interest}} in improving the quality of horses used by the U.S. Cavalry may have been his motivation to breed Arabians. [...] Spencer Borden shared Brown's interest in Arabians as <b>remount</b> bloodstock. Seeking to prove the superior endurance and durability of Arabian horses to the U.S. Army <b>Remount</b> Service, Brown actively encouraged the participation of Arabians in endurance races. He had most of his horses trained to ride and drive. Many were used in endurance races, others shown, and at least one was a polo pony.|$|R

500|$|The {{news of the}} landsknechts' defeat reached Cardona's {{troops at}} about the same time that it had reached Enghien; the Imperial column turned and retreated back towards its {{original}} position. Enghien followed closely with the remainder of his cavalry; he was soon reinforced by a company of Italian mounted arquebusiers, which had been stationed at Racconigi and had started towards the battlefield after hearing the initial artillery exchange. These arquebusiers, dismounting to fire and then <b>remounting,</b> were able to harass the Imperial column sufficiently to slow its retreat. Meanwhile, the French and Swiss infantry of the center, having reached Ceresole, had turned about and returned to the battlefield; Montluc, who was with them, writes: When we heard at Ceresole that M. d'Enghien wanted us, both the Swiss and we Gascons turned toward him—I never saw two battalions form up so quick—we got into rank again actually as we ran along, side by side. [...] The enemy was going off at quick march, firing salvos of arquebuses, and keeping off our horse, when we saw them. [...] And when they descried us only 400 paces away, and our cavalry making ready to charge, they threw down their pikes and surrendered to the horsemen. You might see fifteen or twenty of them round a man-at-arms, pressing about him and asking for quarter, for fear of us of the infantry, who were wanting to cut all their throats. Perhaps as many as half of the Imperial infantry were killed as they were attempting to surrender; the remainder, about 3,150 men, were taken prisoner. A few, including the Baron of Seisneck, who had commanded the German infantry contingents, managed to escape.|$|E
2500|$|Such races {{were held}} at {{different}} venues and, while most accounts say it was Catford, others say Germany. All the accounts say that Barden and Michael were pitched in a five-mile race {{in front of a}} crowd of about 15,000. They start with Michael taking a drink from his coach and manager, Choppy Warburton and end with his riding poorly to his falling off his bike, <b>remounting</b> and setting off in the wrong direction.|$|E
2500|$|Junot was met at Abrantes by an {{emissary}} {{from the}} Prince Regent. Hoping {{to avert a}} French occupation, the diplomat offered to submit under various degrading terms. Understanding that the Portuguese were prostrate, Junot organized four battalions made up of his best remaining men and set out for Lisbon, which was still [...] away. Without a single cannon or cavalryman, 1,500 French troops staggered into Lisbon on 30 November, their cartridges soaked and their uniforms in tatters. There was no opposition. It took ten days for all of Junot's infantry to arrive and even longer for his artillery to show up. His cavalrymen immediately began <b>remounting</b> themselves with horses seized from the local people.|$|E
5000|$|During World War I, the Breeding Bureau {{expanded}} {{the part of}} the program which had been providing horses for the United States Army Cavalry <b>Remount</b> Service. Some of the prominent Thoroughbred runners who were donated to the Cavalry <b>Remount</b> Service include: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{garrison}} {{was established}} in 1904 as the <b>Remount</b> Depot, which supplied the military with horses for both operational and ceremonial purposes. It was operated by the Army <b>Remount</b> Service. The Depot operated throughout the First World War, closing in 1937.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Remount</b> {{referred}} to the provision of fresh horses, particularly for military purposes. [...] The word encompasses both the animals themselves and {{the means by which}} they were provided. In many cases, <b>remounts</b> were horses provided to replace those killed or injured in battle.|$|R
2500|$|Shortly thereafter, {{he wrote}} to Antonio Vasselli {{outlining}} his plans for that year, concluding with the somewhat ominous: [...] "All of this with a new illness contracted in Paris, which has still not passed and for which I am awaiting your prescription" [...] But, {{in the body of}} the letter, he lays out what he will be aiming to accomplish in 1843: in Vienna, a French drama; in Naples, a planned Ruy-Blas in Paris for the Opéra-Comique, [...] "a Flemish subject", and for the Opéra, [...] "I am using a Portuguese subject in five acts" [...] (which was to be Dom Sébastien, Roi de Portugal, and actually given on 13 November.) Finally, he adds [...] "and first I am <b>remounting</b> Les Martyrs which is creating a furor in the provinces".|$|E
2500|$|The first {{individual}} trampolining competitions {{were held}} in colleges and schools in the USA and then in Europe. [...] In {{the early years of}} competition there was no defined format with performers often completing lengthy routines and even <b>remounting</b> if falling off partway through. Gradually competitions became more codified such that by the 1950s the 10-bounce routine was the norm thereby paving the way for the first World Championships which were organised by Ted Blake of Nissen, and held in London in 1964. The first World Champions were both American, Dan Millman and Judy Wills Cline (both pictured to the right together with members of the Household Cavalry at the closing ceremony). Kurt Baechler of Switzerland and Ted Blake of England were the European pioneers and the first ever televised National Championships {{were held in}} England in 1958.|$|E
2500|$|The fort {{had lost}} much of its {{importance}} {{by the turn of the}} 20th century. Advances in naval firepower meant that the principal line of defence for the Thames had been moved downriver to the batteries at Grain and Shoeburyness, where bigger guns with a longer range could control the entire estuary mouth. The old RML guns were now obsolete, while the emplacements provided little protection against modern naval artillery. A War Office report of 1887-8 commented that New Tavern Fort's [...] "guns are crowded, and behind weak parapets; the parapets should be revised, and the number of guns reduced, so that they may be more effectively mounted." [...] Proposals were advanced for this to be done and for the range of the guns to be extended by <b>remounting</b> them on modified carriages, but neither of these improvements were implemented.|$|E
50|$|After {{attending}} officers {{training at}} the Plattsburg Barracks, Tuckerman was commissioned a Second Lieutenant of Infantry in the United States Army on November 27, 1917. He was then transferred to Quartermaster Corps and assigned to <b>Remount</b> Division. While serving with the American Expeditionary Forces, he was assistant <b>remount</b> officer for the advance section Services of Supply, First United States Army, and 1st Corps Observation Group, and <b>remount</b> officer for the 77th Infantry Division. He was discharged on February 25, 1919.|$|R
50|$|The {{need for}} <b>remounts</b> for {{military}} use declined {{with the use}} of horses in warfare generally, particularly following World War II, when both the United States and the United Kingdom disbanded their military <b>remount</b> programs, in some cases reassigning them to agricultural and ceremonial purposes.|$|R
5000|$|There {{was also}} a {{determined}} attempt to engage professional horse breeders in the <b>Remount</b> Service, beginning in 1918 {{with the approval of}} a breeding plan for cavalry horses that combined the efforts of the <b>Remount</b> Service with the Bureau of Animal Industry. A 1921 issue of the Cavalry Journal contained an update from the [...] "American <b>Remount</b> Association" [...] calling for owners of [...] "high-class registered Thoroughbreds" [...] to add their stallions to the program. The author also mentioned a reduced-cost registry for [...] "half-breed" [...] Thoroughbreds.|$|R
2500|$|The Cowboys fired {{a number}} of shots at the Earp party, but the only {{casualty}} was Vermillion's horse, which was killed. Wyatt's long coat was punctured by bullets on both sides. Another bullet struck his boot heel and his saddle horn was hit as well, burning the saddle hide and narrowly missing Wyatt. Firing his pistol, Wyatt shot Johnny Barnes {{in the chest and}} Milt Hicks in the arm. Vermillion tried to retrieve his rifle wedged in the scabbard under his fallen horse, exposing himself to the Cowboys' gunfire. Doc Holliday helped him gain cover. [...] Wyatt had trouble <b>remounting</b> his horse because his cartridge belt had slipped down around his legs. He was finally able to get on his horse and retreat. McMaster was grazed by a bullet that cut through the straps of his field glasses.|$|E
2500|$|Guiscard soon rose to distinction. The Lombards {{turned against}} their {{erstwhile}} allies, and Pope Leo IX determined to expel the Norman freebooters. His army was defeated, however, at the Battle of Civitate sul Fortore in 1053 by the Normans, united under Humphrey. Humphrey commanded the centre against the pope's Swabian troops. [...] Early {{in the battle}} Count Richard of Aversa, commanding the right van, put the Lombards to flight and chased them down, then returned to help rout the Swabians. [...] Guiscard had {{come all the way}} from Calabria to command the left. His troops were held in reserve until, seeing Humphrey's forces ineffectually charging the pope's centre, he called up his father-in-law's reinforcements and joined the fray, distinguishing himself personally, even being dismounted and <b>remounting</b> again three separate times, according to William of Apulia. Honored for his actions at Civitate, Guiscard succeeded Humphrey as count of Apulia in 1057, over his elder half-brother Geoffrey. In company with Roger, his youngest brother, Guiscard carried on the conquest of Apulia and Calabria, while Richard conquered the principality of Capua.|$|E
