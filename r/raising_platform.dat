Government, funding institutions, enterprises, educational institutions and nongovernmental organisations play the crucial role in developing and operating the awareness <b>raising</b> <b>platform</b> focused on climate change mitigation. Objective of the research is to evaluate the role of six non-governmental organisations (NGOs), providing different services - consultative, financial, educational, in raising capacities in climate change field in Latvia: Environmental Consultative Council, Environmental Science and Education Council, Climate Change Financing Instrument Consultative Council, Tri-Party Cooperation Sub-Council on Environmental Protection Issues, Climate Technology Cooperation Council. The evaluation is structured used the main evaluation criteria widely used for assessment {{of the success of}} activities and projects in the field of the environment. These criteria are: relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact and sustainability. Within the research a combined evaluation methodology based on a criteria-based evaluation and multicriteria decision making technique TOPSIS is developed for determination of the most effective activities of the nongovernmental organisations for climate change mitigation...|$|E
40|$|The lack of {{precision}} to predict service performance through load indices {{may lead to}} wrong decisions {{regarding the use of}} web services, compromising service performance and <b>raising</b> <b>platform</b> cost unnecessarily. This paper presents experimental studies to qualify the behaviour of load indices in the web service context. The experiments consider three services that generate controlled and significant server demands, four levels of workload for each service and six distinct execution scenarios. The evaluation considers three relevant perspectives: the capability for representing recent workloads, the capability for predicting near-future performance and finally stability. Eight different load indices were analysed, including the JMX Average Time index (proposed in this paper) specifically designed to address the limitations of the other indices. A systematic approach is applied to evaluate the different load indices, considering a multiple linear regression model based on the stepwise-AIC method. The results show that the load indices studied represent the workload to some extent; however, in contrast to expectations, most of them do not exhibit a coherent correlation with service performance and this can result in stability problems. The JMX Average Time index is an exception, showing a stable behaviour which is tightly-coupled to the service runtime for all executions. Load indices are used to predict the service runtime and therefore their inappropriate use can lead to decisions that will impact negatively on both service performance and execution cost...|$|E

5000|$|The Qucha (Quechua for [...] "lake") is an {{artificial}} lake fed by a spring through {{two sets of}} finely constructed stone fountains with a <b>raised</b> <b>platform</b> beside one of them. It is a central feature of the site that is overlooked by both the temple and the <b>raised</b> <b>platform,</b> and is fed by the two fountains, which are of a type that the Inka used in cleansing rituals and {{as a place to}} make offerings. Between the northern fountain and the <b>raised</b> <b>platform</b> archaeologists found a deep layer of ash that may have been the remains of burnt offerings made on or near the <b>raised</b> <b>platform.</b> This ash was possibly being stored prior to depositing it in the qucha and letting it wash into the Willkanuta River (a similar ceremony is reported for Inka Cuzco). In Inka cosmology, springs were often regarded as sacred, and the association with the temple and the volcano may suggest that the spring at Raqch'i, with its fountains, was conceived of as the place of origin of the K'ana people mentioned in the legend of Viracocha.|$|R
