5|$|The {{sapphire}} bearing Yogo dike is a {{dark gray}} to green intrusive rock known as a lamprophyre. The lamprophyre is an unusual igneous rock that contains a low content of silica. The rock has a porphyritic texture with large crystals of orthopyroxene and phlogopite set in a fine grained matrix. The phlogopite crystals {{have been used to}} determine the age of the dike and its crystallization temperature (900°C (1,650°F)). The dike also contains fragments of other rock types. These xenoliths include pieces of limestone, clastic sedimentary rocks, and gneiss. In some locations, due to the abundance of xenoliths, the dike has the appearance of a limestone breccia in an igneous matrix. One gneiss fragment found as a xenolith contains corundum. The Yogo sapphires themselves are rimmed with a <b>reaction</b> <b>layer</b> of spinel and are etched, indicating that the sapphires were not in chemical equilibrium with their host, the lamprophyre magma. This suggests the sapphire crystals may have originated in an earlier rock, such as a corundum-bearing gneiss, later assimilated by the lamprophyre magma at depth. Earlier investigators had assumed that the sapphire had crystallized from the magma with the necessary high aluminium content provided by assimilation of clay rich shales of the Proterozoic Belt Supergroup sediments which are known to be present at depth in the region.|$|E
40|$|The chemical-gas dynamic {{mechanisms}} {{behind the}} instability and {{failure of a}} one-dimensional pulsating detonation wave driven by a three-step chain-branching reac-tion are revealed by direct numerical simulation. Two types of pulsating instability observed experimentally are explained. The first involves regular oscillations of the detonation front, where the instability is driven by low-frequency finite-amplitude compression and expansion waves in the chain-branching induction zone between the main <b>reaction</b> <b>layer</b> and the detonation shock. For irregular oscillations of the front, the instability mechanism first involves a decoupling between the shock and main <b>reaction</b> <b>layer.</b> Subsequently, the main <b>reaction</b> <b>layer</b> accelerates, drives a com-pression wave ahead of it, and undergoes a transition to detonation. This internal detonation wave overtakes the lead detonation shock, generating a new high-pressure detonation, which rapidly decays. A smaller-amplitude pressure oscillation occurs during the decay with a mechanism reminiscent of that observed for the previous regular oscillation, before the detonation and main <b>reaction</b> <b>layer</b> once again decou-ple and the instability cycle is repeated. For failure scenarios, the shock temperature is observed to drop to the cross-over temperature for the chain-branching reaction, causing the main <b>reaction</b> <b>layer</b> to decouple and retreat indefinitely from the deto-nation shock...|$|E

Investigations of the deformation microstructure beneath hardness indentations elicited a pronounced influence of the <b>reaction</b> <b>layers</b> outer and inner interfaces on the observed hardness. Heat treating of dissimilar friction stir welds showed that with pure Al, the joint strength is governed by the formation of Kirkendall-porosity at the reaction layer/Al interface; in joints with Al-Si it is controlled by the thickness of the 3 ̆b 7 phase layer.

Tests were conducted with different welding process parameters. The results were analyzed by means of tensile test, Vickers micro hardness test, fatigue test, Charpy v-notch impact test, and SEM-EDX (energy dispersive X-ray) analysis {{in order to determine}} the phases that occurred during welding. The strength of the joints varied with increasing friction pressure and friction time keeping upset pressure and upset time constant. The joint strength increased, and then decreased after reaching a maximum value, with increasing friction pressure and friction time. The process of friction welding between the aluminum alloy and the stainless steel is proposed to evolve as follows: welding progresses from the outer to the inner region; an unbounded region is retained at the centre of the weld interface with shorter friction time; longer friction time causes the formation of an intermetallic <b>reaction</b> <b>layer</b> at the weld interface and the <b>reaction</b> <b>layer</b> grows as the friction time increases. Some of the welds had poor strength due to the accumulation of alloying elements at the joint interface.

In the four point bending test of the dissimilar joints prepared by heating at 973 K for 300 s, the brittle fracture did not occurred around the joint interface but mainly in the inside of nickel aluminide coating. The interface of <b>reaction</b> <b>layers</b> with 10 µm were chemically well bonded. The sample with Ni- 69 at%Al- 9 at%Si coating exhibited highest bonding strength of about 56 MPa because of the smallest void ratio of the obtained compounds...|$|R
40|$|Titanium {{aluminide}} {{metal matrix}} composites are prominent materials systems {{being considered for}} high temperature aerospace applications. One of the major problems with this material is the reactivity between existing reinforcements and the matrix after prolonged thermal exposure. This paper presents results from an investigation of reaction kinetics between Ti- 14 Al- 21 Nb (wt pct) and SCS- 6 fibers and SiC fibers with surface coatings of TiB 2, TiC, TiN, W, and Si. Microstructural evaluation of the <b>reaction</b> <b>layers</b> as well as matrix regions around the fibers is presented...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{is aimed}} at {{studying}} the impact behaviour of commercially available Aluminium matrix composites, in a temperature interval ranging from 25 degrees C to 200 degrees C. The results of instrumented impact tests and of microstructural and fractographic observations are correlated with the tensile properties of these materials. A description of the phenomena involved (particles cracking, interfacial failure associated to matrix-reinforcement <b>reaction</b> <b>layers,</b> ductile behaviour of the matrix) is given. The effect of testing temperature {{as well as that}} of the matrix characteristics are presented and discussed...|$|R
