40|$|In the {{agrochemical}} industry, {{companies are}} challenged with an extreme seasonality in demand {{driven by the}} crops' growing cycles. Therefore, balancing supply with such fluctuating demand has been a struggle for most companies due to their capacity constraints. One way to accommodate the demand is to stock enough inventory ahead of the peak seasons, while {{the other is to}} increase the production capacity so that the companies can react to the changing demand more quickly. However, either alternative comes at a significant cost. This paper examines the optimal mix of production capacity and inventory for a company to meet customers' demand at the highest net present value (NPV) of operating assets value add (OAVA). We use a multi-period, multi-stage, multi-product mixed integer linear optimization model to determine the best combination of resources. Viable resource options include stocking inventory ahead of the peak seasons, enhancing output through overtime, outsourcing production activities to a third party, and acquiring new assets for a particular production stage. The results show that the optimal OAVA comes from a combination of all these viable resources. Additionally, the master production schedule, the resulting inventory levels, and the <b>recommended</b> <b>timings</b> for external resources and asset acquisition are important takeaways from our model. They serve not only as the guidance of the company's day-to-day operations, but also as the quantitative analysis necessary to communicate with stakeholders across different functional teams with potentially conflicting interests. by Cindy (Hsin-ying) Wu and José Antonio González Duhart Muñoz de Cote.

40|$|AbstractEndurance {{athletic}} performance is highly {{related to a}} number of factors that can be altered through altitude and hypoxic training including increases in erythrocyte volume, maximal aerobic exercise capacity, capillary density, and economy. Physiological adaptations in response to acute and chronic exposure to hypoxic environments are well documented and range from short-term detrimental effects to longer-term adaptations that can improve performance at altitude and in sea-level competitions. Many altitude and hypoxic training protocols have been developed, employing various combinations of living and training at sea-level, low, moderate, and high altitudes and utilizing natural and artificial altitudes, with varying degrees of effectiveness. Several factors have been identified that are associated with individual responses to hypoxic training, and techniques for identifying those athletes most likely to benefit from hypoxic training continue to be investigated. Exposure to sufficiently high altitude (2000 – 3000 [*]m) for more than 12 [*]h/day, while training at lower altitudes, for a minimum of 21 days is <b>recommended.</b> <b>Timing</b> of altitude training related to competition remains under debate, although general recommendations can be considered...|$|E

40|$|Background: Despite efforts {{aimed at}} {{reducing}} the prehospital delay and treatment delay, a considerable proportion of patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) present late and receive the reperfusion therapy after unacceptably long time periods. This study aimed at finding out the patients' decision delay, prehospital delay, door-to-electrocardiography (ECG), door-to-needle, and door-to-primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) times and their determinants among STEMI patients. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted among 96 patients with STEMI admitted in a tertiary care center in South India. The data were collected using interview of the patients and review of records. The distribution of the data was assessed using Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, and the comparisons of the patients' decision delay, prehospital delay, and time to start reperfusion therapy with the different variables were done using Mann–Whitney U-test or Kruskal–Wallis test {{based on the number}} of groups. Results: The mean (standard deviation) and median (range) age of the participants were 55 (11) years and 57 (51) years, respectively. The median patients' decision delay, prehospital delay, door-to-ECG, door-to-needle, and door-to-primary PCI times were 75, 290, 12, 75, 110 min, respectively. Significant factors associated (P < 0. 05) with patients' decision delay were alcoholism, symptom progression, and attempt at symptom relief measures at home. Prehospital delay was significantly associated (P < 0. 05) with domicile, difficulty in arranging money, prior consultation at study center, place of symptom onset, symptom interpretation, and mode of transportation. Conclusions: The prehospital delay time among the South Indian population is still unacceptably high.

40|$|AbstractObjective: <b>Recommended</b> <b>timing</b> of {{coronary}} revascularization after transmural {{acute myocardial infarction}} ranges from immediate surgical intervention to repair 4 weeks after infarction. Such wide variation has created a dilemma {{in the management of}} these patients. The objective {{of this study was to}} delineate the optimal timing of revascularization after transmural acute myocardial infarction in a large and contemporary patient population. Methods: We performed a retrospective multicenter analysis of 32, 099 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting as the sole procedure after transmural myocardial infarction between 1991 and 1996 by 179 surgeons at 33 hospitals in New York State. Results: Overall hospital mortality for all patients who underwent coronary revascularization with a history of transmural myocardial infarction was 3. 3 %. Hospital mortality decreased with increasing time interval between revascularization and transmural acute myocardial infarction: 14. 2 %, 13. 8 %, 7. 9 %, 3. 8 %, 2. 9 %, and 2. 7 % for less than 6 hours, 6 hours to 1 day, 1 to 3 days, 4 to 7 days, 7 to 14 days, and greater than 15 days, respectively. Multivariate analyses of 43 potential risk factors suggests that revascularization within 3 days of transmural acute myocardial infarction is independently associated with mortality. Conclusions: Coronary revascularization within 3 days of a transmural acute myocardial infarction might be an added risk for mortality. In the absence of absolute indications for emergency surgical intervention, such as structural complications and ongoing ischemia, a 3 -day waiting period before surgical revascularization should be considered.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Geriatric {{rehabilitation}} reimbursement increasingly requires documented deficits {{on standardized}} measures. Tandem stance performance can characterize balance, but protocols are not standardized. Objective The {{purpose of this}} study was to explore the impact of: (1) initial support to stabilize in position and (2) maximum hold time on tandem stance tests of balance in older adults. Design A cross-sectional secondary analysis of observational cohort data was conducted. METHODS: One hundred seventeen community-dwelling older adults (71 % female, 12 % black) were assigned to 1 of 3 groups based on the need for initial support to perform tandem stance: (1) unable even with support, (2) able only with support, and (3) able without support. The able without support group was further stratified on hold time in seconds: (1) < 10 (low), (2) 10 to 29, (medium), and (3) 30 (high). Groups were compared on primary outcomes (gait speed, Timed "Up & Go" Test performance, and balance confidence) using analysis of variance. RESULTS: Twelve participants were unable to perform tandem stance, 14 performed tandem stance only with support, and 91 performed tandem stance without support. Compared with the able without support group, the able with support group had statistically or clinically worse performance and balance confidence. No significant differences were found between the able with support group and the unable even with support group on these same measures. Extending the hold time to 30 seconds in a protocol without initial support eliminated ceiling effects for 16 % of the study sample. Limitations Small comparison groups, use of a secondary analysis, and lack of generalizability of results were limitations of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Requiring initial support to stabilize in tandem stance appears to reflect meaningful deficits in balance-related mobility measures, so failing to consider support may inflate balance estimates and confound hold time comparisons. Additionally, 10 -second maximum hold times limit discrimination of balance in adults with a higher level of function. For community-dwelling older adults, we <b>recommend</b> <b>timing</b> for at least 30 seconds and documenting initial support for consideration when interpreting performance...|$|R

Here, we report the indicator-level CareTrack Australia findings for SSI prophylaxis. Indicators were extracted from Australian and international clinical guidelines and ratified by clinical experts. A sample designed to be representative of the Australian population was recruited (n= 1154). Participants' medical records were reviewed and analysed for compliance with the five SSI indicators. The main outcome measure was the percentage of eligible healthcare encounters with documented compliance with indicators for appropriate SSI prophylaxis. Of the 35, 145 CareTrack Australia encounters, 702 (2 %) were eligible for scoring against the SSI indicators.

40|$|Anthropogenic ammonia (NH 3) {{emissions}} mainly {{result from}} agricultural activities where manure spreading plays a significant role. For a Mediterranean rainfed winter cereal system {{there is a}} lack of data regarding NH 3 emissions. The aim of this work is to provide field data on N losses due to NH 3 volatilization as a consequence of the introduction of slurries in fertilization strategies and also, to assess the influence of environmental conditions and slurry characteristics on emissions. The fertilizing strategies include the use of slurry from fattening pigs (PS), sows (PSS) and/or mineral fertilizer (M) as ammonium nitrate. Fertilizers were spread over the calcareous soil at sowing and/or at tillering at rates from 15 to 45 kg NH 4 +–N ha− 1 for M and from 48. 8 to 250. 3 kg NH 4 +–N ha− 1 for slurries. The NH 3 emissions were quantified during three cropping seasons. Average losses from the total ammonium nitrogen applied ranged from 7 to 78 % for M and from 6 to 64 % for slurries and they were not directly proportional to the amounts of applied ammonium. The best results on NH 3 volatilization reduction were registered when soil water content (SWC, 0 – 30 cm) was below 56 % of its field capacity and also, when slurry dry matter (DM) was in the interval of 6. 1 – 9. 3 % for PS or much lower (0. 8 %) for PSS. High slurry DM favoured crust formation and the lower rates promoted infiltration, both of which reduced NH 3 emissions. Nevertheless, at tillering, the lower DM content was the most effective in controlling emissions (0. 05). A single slurry application at tillering did not negatively affect yield biomass. The combining of <b>recommended</b> <b>timing</b> of applications with slurry DM content and SWC should allow producers to minimize volatilization while maintaining financial benefits...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Investigations {{were carried}} out to {{evaluate}} {{the performance of a}} low grade low heat rejection (LHR) diesel engine with ceramic coated cylinder head with 3 -mm air gap with different operating conditions [normal temperature and pre-heated temperature] of crude mohr oil (CMO) and mohr oil based biodiesel (MOBD) with varied injection pressure and injection timing. Performance parameters of brake thermal efficiency, exhaust gas temperature, volumetric efficiency and sound intensity were determined at various values of brake mean effective pressure (BMEP). Exhaust emissions of smoke and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) were recorded at the various values of BMEP. Combustion characteristics at peak load operation of the engine were measured with TDC (top dead centre) encoder, pressure transducer, console and special pressure-crank angle software package. Conventional engine (CE) showed compatible performance, while LHR engine showed marginally increased performance with vegetable oils (CMO & MOBD) operation at <b>recommended</b> injection <b>timing</b> and pressure. The performance of both version of the engine improved with advanced injection timing and at higher injection pressure when compared with CE with pure diesel operation...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Important {{studies of}} {{cardiopulmonary}} resuscitation (CPR) techniques influence {{the development of}} new guidelines. We systematically reviewed the efficacy of some important studies of CPR. Data Sources: The data analyzed in this review are mainly from articles included in PubMed and EMBASE, published from 1964 to 2014. Study Selection: Original articles and critical reviews about CPR techniques were selected for review. Results: The survival rate after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is improving. This improvement is associated with the performance of uninterrupted chest compressions and simple airway management procedures during bystander CPR. Real-time feedback devices can be used {{to improve the quality of}} CPR. The <b>recommended</b> dose, <b>timing,</b> and indications for adrenaline (epinephrine) use may change. The appropriate target temperature for targeted temperature management is still unclear. Conclusions: New studies over the past 5 years have evaluated various aspects of CPR in OHCA. Some of these studies were high-quality randomized controlled trials, which may help to improve the scientific understanding of resuscitation techniques and result in changes to CPR guidelines...|$|R
40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out to {{evaluate}} {{the performance of a}} medium grade low heat rejection (LHR) diesel engine with air gap insulated piston and air gap insulated liner with different operating conditions [normal temperature and pre-heated temperature] of cotton seed biodiesel with varied injector opening pressure and injection timing. Performance parameters of brake thermal efficiency, brake specific energy consumption, exhaust gas temperature, coolant load and volumetric efficiency were evaluated at full load operation of the engine. Comparative studies were made with data of conventional engine (CE) with biodiesel. Engine with LHR combustion chamber improved its performance when compared with CE. The optimum injection timing with CE with biodiesel was 31 o bTDC (before top dead centre), while it was 29 o bTDC for engine with LHR combustion chamber. At manufacturer’s <b>recommended</b> injection <b>timing</b> of 27 o bTDC, engine with LHR combustion chamber with biodiesel operation increased peak brake thermal efficiency by 9 %, at full load–decreased coolant load at full load by 17 % and volumetric efficiency by 6 % in comparison with CE with biodiesel operation...|$|R
