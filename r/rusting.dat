40|$|Abstract. Leaf <b>rust,</b> stem <b>rust,</b> and stripe <b>rust</b> {{are among}} the most {{important}} diseases of wheat and barley worldwide and are best controlled using genetic resistance. To increase the diversity of <b>rust</b> resistance in wheat and barley, a project was initiated to identify and characterise <b>rust</b> resistance genes from the wild species of Aegilops sharonensis (Sharon goatgrass) and Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum (wild barley), respectively. One hundred and two accessions of Sharon goatgrass from Israel and 318 Wild Barley Diversity Collection (WBDC) accessions from the Fertile Crescent, Central Asia, North Africa, and the Caucasus region were evaluated for resistance to leaf <b>rust,</b> stem <b>rust,</b> and/or stripe <b>rust.</b> Sharon goatgrass exhibited a wide range of infection types (ITs) in response to leaf <b>rust,</b> stem <b>rust,</b> and stripe <b>rust.</b> The percentage of resistant accessions in Sharon goatgrass was 58. 8 – 78. 4 % for leaf <b>rust,</b> 11. 8 – 69. 6 % for stem <b>rust,</b> and 46. 1 % for stripe <b>rust,</b> depending on the race used and the plant growth stage. Genetic studies with Sharon goatgrass revealed oligogenic resistance to leaf <b>rust</b> and stem <b>rust.</b> Wild barley also exhibited a wide range of ITs to leaf <b>rust</b> and stem rust; however, the overall frequency of resistance was lower than for Sharon goatgrass. The percentage of resistant accessions in wild barley was 25. 8 % for leaf <b>rust</b> and 5. 7 – 20. 1 % for stem <b>rust,</b> depending on the race used. Resistance to the new virulent stem <b>rust</b> race TTKS (i. e. Ug 99), present in eastern Africa, was found in both Sharon goatgrass (70 % of accessions) and wild barley (25 % of 20 accessions tested).

5|$|Chromium metal left {{standing}} in air is passivated by oxidation, forming a thin, protective, surface layer. This layer is a spinel structure {{only a few}} molecules thick. It is very dense, and prevents the diffusion of oxygen into the underlying metal. This {{is different from the}} oxide that forms on iron and carbon steel, through which elemental oxygen continues to migrate, reaching the underlying material to cause incessant <b>rusting.</b> Passivation can be enhanced by short contact with oxidizing acids like nitric acid. Passivated chromium is stable against acids. Passivation can be removed with a strong reducing agent that destroys the protective oxide layer on the metal. Chromium metal treated in this way readily dissolves in weak acids.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Since Fe-Cu-C {{sintered}} steels {{are easily}} <b>rusted,</b> they are coated with <b>rust</b> preventive oils. High viscosity of those <b>rust</b> preventive oils decrease workability, and low viscosity deteriorates <b>rust</b> preventive performance. Therefore, {{it is necessary}} to develop new <b>rust</b> preventive oils with contradictory properties of low viscosity and superior <b>rust</b> prevention. However, precise methodology to evaluate <b>rust</b> prevention ability has not been established. In this study, we developed new technique to quantitatively evaluate <b>rust</b> prevention ability by measuring the open circuit potential through thin corrosive solution on Fe-Cu-C sintered steels coated with a <b>rust</b> preventive oils. As a result, the ability for <b>rust</b> prevention can be measured quantitatively, and it decreases slowly over time, with repeating destruction and restoration. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} deteriorating processes of <b>rust</b> prevention ability for <b>rust</b> prevention oils are composed of three characteristics steps respectively. That is, in the first step the great open circuit potential changes from 0 V to- 0. 3 V with repetition were observed where the excellent <b>rust</b> prevention ability was kept, in the second step it decreases slowly from- 0. 1 V to- 0. 4 V with oscillation of the small potential changes where the gradual decrease of <b>rust</b> prevention ability was recognized and in the third step it decreases monotonously in the lower potential than- 0. 4 V where the <b>rust</b> was observed because of the remarkable deteriorating of the <b>rust</b> prevention ability...|$|R

40|$|Key message We {{detected}} several, {{most likely}} novel QTL for adult plant resistance to <b>rusts.</b> Notably three QTL improved resistance to leaf <b>rust</b> and stripe <b>rust</b> simultaneously indicating broad spectrum resistance QTL. Abstract The <b>rusts</b> of wheat (Puccinia spp.) are destructive fungal wheat diseases. The deployment of resistant cultivars plays {{a central role}} in integrated <b>rust</b> disease management. Durability of resistance would be preferred, but is difficult to analyse. The Austrian winter wheat cultivar Capo was released in the 1989 and grown on a large acreage during more than two decades and maintained a good level of quantitative leaf <b>rust</b> and stripe <b>rust</b> resistance. Two bi-parental mapping populations: Capo × Arina and Capo × Furore were tested in multiple environments for severity of leaf <b>rust</b> and stripe <b>rust</b> at the adult plant stage in replicated field experiments. Quantitative trait loci associated with leaf <b>rust</b> and stripe <b>rust</b> severity were mapped using DArT and SSR markers. Five QTL were detected in multiple environments associated with resistance to leaf <b>rust</b> designated as QLr. ifa- 2 AL, QLr. ifa- 2 BL, QLr. ifa- 2 BS, QLr. ifa- 3 BS, and QLr. ifa- 5 BL, and five for resistance to stripe <b>rust</b> QYr. ifa- 2 AL, QYr. ifa- 2 BL, QYr. ifa- 3 AS, QYr. ifa- 3 BS, and QYr. ifa- 5 A. For all QTL apart from two (QYr. ifa- 3 AS, QLr. ifa- 5 BL) Capo contributed the resistance improving allele. The leaf <b>rust</b> and stripe <b>rust</b> resistance QTL on 2 AL, 2 BL and 3 BS mapped to the same chromosome positions, indicating either closely linked genes or pleiotropic gene action. These three multiple disease resistance QTL (QLr. ifa- 2 AL/QYr. ifa- 2 AL, QLr. ifa. 2 BL/QYr. ifa- 2 BL, QLr. ifa- 3 BS/QYr. ifa. 3 BS) potentially contribute novel resistance sources for stripe <b>rust</b> and leaf <b>rust.</b> The long-lasting resistance of Capo apparently rests upon a combination of several genes.
