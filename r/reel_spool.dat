50|$|This type {{of fishing}} line is expensive, {{sometimes}} four times the cost of equivalent monofilament.

50|$|Fly lines {{consist of}} a tough braided or {{monofilament}} core, wrapped in a thick waterproof plastic sheath, often of polyvinyl chloride (PVC). In the case of floating fly lines, the PVC sheath is usually embedded with many 'microballoons' or air bubbles, and may also be impregnated with silicone or other lubricants to give buoyancy and reduce wear. In order to fill up the <b>reel</b> <b>spool</b> and ensure an adequate reserve {{in case of a}} run by a powerful fish, fly lines are usually attached to a secondary line at the butt section, called backing. Fly line backing is usually composed of braided dacron or gelspun monofilaments. All fly lines are equipped with a leader of monofilament or fluorocarbon fishing line, usually (but not always) tapered in diameter, and referred to by the 'X-size' (0X, 2X, 4X, etc.) of its final tip section, or tippet.|$|E

The best KAP work seems be done at lower altitudes than you might imagine (100-200'), so no special equipment is required. The most problematic KAP flights are when the best camera shot requires the kite to be flown amongst tall trees or buildings, so quick haul-in can be a plus.|$|R
25|$|Direct-drive <b>reels</b> {{have the}} <b>spool</b> and handle {{directly}} coupled. When the handle moves forwards, the spool moves forwards, and vice versa. With a fast-running fish, {{this may have}} consequences for the angler's knuckles. Traditional fly reels are direct-drive.|$|R
50|$|Fly reels, or fly casting reels, {{with a few}} exceptions, {{are really}} little more than line-storage devices. In use, a fly angler strips line off the reel {{with one hand while}} casting and {{manipulating}} the rod with the other. Slack line is picked up by rotating the <b>reel</b> <b>spool.</b> Even today, the vast majority of fly reels are manually operated, single-action reels of rather simple construction, with a simple click-pawl drag system. However, in recent years, more advanced fly reels have been developed for larger fish and more demanding conditions. These newer reels feature disc-type mechanical, adjustable drag systems to permit the use of lighter leaders and tippets, or to successfully capture fish that undertake long, powerful runs. Many newer fly reels have large arbors to increase the speed of the retrieve and to improve drag performance during long runs. In order to prevent corrosion, saltwater fly reels often use aluminum frames and spools or stainless steel components with sealed bearing and drive mechanisms.|$|E

Finite element method was applied to optimize the design under static and dynamic loading according to the operation condition of the spool. Finite element analysis results confirmed that increasing the wall thickness was sufficient for radial compression force. As the wall thickness of Al spool was 0. 65 mm, the wall thickness of Mg spool was increased to 1 mm to obtain equivalent factor of safety.

5|$|A surface {{marker buoy}} (SMB) with a reel and line {{is often used}} by a dive leader to allow the boat to monitor {{progress}} of the dive group. This can provide the operator with a positive control of depth, by remaining slightly negative and using the buoyancy of the float to support this slight over-weighting. This allows the line to be kept under slight tension which {{reduces the risk of}} entanglement. The <b>reel</b> or <b>spool</b> used to store and roll up the line usually has slightly negative buoyancy, so that if released it will hang down and not float away.|$|R

5|$|A film studio set {{was created}} by photographing several <b>reel</b> <b>spools</b> with strips of film {{dangling}} {{against a background of}} blinking lights. The casting office {{was created by}} silhouetting strips of cardboard against a white background. To portray the mental anguish of the protagonist, strips of paper were cut into the shape of twisted trees, which were silhouetted against a background of moving shadows and set in motion with an electric fan. To create a scene {{near the end of the}} film, when the protagonist starts becoming delirious, the camera moves through a maze of different sized cubes, with geometric designs inside them, all placed on a flat, shiny service. The heaven setting was also a miniature set created from paper cubes, tin cans, cigar boxes, toy trains, and a motorized Erector Set. No still photos were taken for the film, but illustrations showing prism and kaleidoscope effects have been made by enlarging frames of negative. The paper prints were considerably softer than the movie print in order to avoid graininess. The final film was edited to a one-reel length of 1,200 feet of film strip, featuring about 150 scenes. Florey said it featured the same number of angles as full-length feature films of the time. Although the film was carefully edited to be synchronized with Rhapsody in Blue, much of the original lyrical quality has been lost in shortened and modified versions of the film.|$|R
5|$|A delayed or {{deployable}} surface {{marker buoy}} (DSMB) is a soft inflatable tube which {{is attached to}} a <b>reel</b> or <b>spool</b> line at one end, and is inflated by the diver under water and released to float to the surface, deploying the line as it ascends. This provides information to the surface that the diver is about to ascend, and where he is.

They are mostly used to signal the boat that the diver has started ascent or to indicate a problem in technical diving.|$|R
50|$|A common {{precaution}} for drift diving {{is to have}} {{a supporting}} boat follow the divers and for the dive leader to use a surface marker buoy. It is also generally necessary for all divers intending to drift dive as a group to enter the water at the same time, so there is less chance of being separated by the flow. It is quite common for current speeds to vary with depth, so a low drag buoy and line will reduce the workload on the diver carrying the reel. Mitigation equipment for separation may include signaling devices and a compass, and a personal DSMB and <b>reel</b> or <b>spool.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Spinning rods {{are made}} from {{graphite}} or fiberglass with a cork or PVC foam handle, and tend to be between 5 and 8.5 feet (1.5–2.6 m) in length. Typically, spinning rods have anywhere from 5-8 guides arranged along {{the underside of the}} rod to help control the line. The eyes decrease in size from the handle to the tip, with the one nearest the handle usually much larger than the rest to allow less friction as the coiled line comes off the reel, and to gather the very large loops of line that come off the spinning <b>reel's</b> <b>spool.</b> Unlike bait casting and spin casting reels, the spinning reel hangs beneath the rod rather than sitting on top, and is held in place with a sliding or locking reel seat. The fisherman's second and third fingers straddle the [...] "leg" [...] of the reel where it is attached to the reel seat on the rod, and the weight of the reel hangs beneath the rod, which makes for a more comfortable way to fish for extended periods. This also allows the rod to be held in the fisherman's dominant hand (the handle on most modern spinning reels is reversible) which greatly increases control and nuance applied to the rod itself. Spinning rods and reels are widely used in fishing for popular North American sport fish including bass, trout, pike and walleye. Popular targets for spinning in the UK and European continent are pike, perch, eel and zander (walleye). Longer spinning rods with elongated grip handles for two-handed casting are frequently employed for saltwater or steelhead and salmon fishing. Spinning rods are also widely used for trolling and still fishing with live bait.|$|R

50|$|Copper, monel {{and lead}} core fishing lines {{are used as}} heavy {{trolling}} main lines, usually followed with fluorocarbon line near the lure or bait with fishing swivel between the lines. Due to their high density, these fishing lines sink rapidly in water and they require less line for achieving desired trolling depth. On the other hand, these lines are relatively thick for desired strength, especially when compared with braided fishing lines and they often require <b>reels</b> with larger <b>spools.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Fly reels are {{normally}} manual, single-action designs. Rotating {{a handle on}} the side of the <b>reel</b> rotates the <b>spool</b> which retrieves the line, usually at a 1:1 ratio (i.e., one complete revolution of the handle equals one revolution of the <b>spool).</b> [...] Fly <b>reels</b> are one of the simplest reels and have far fewer parts than a spinning reel. [...] The larger the fish the more important the reel becomes. [...] On the outside of the reel there are two levels of knobs these are the spool release and the drag adjustment.|$|R
50|$|The {{endless loop}} tape {{cartridge}} was designed in 1952 by Bernard Cousino of Toledo, Ohio, around a single reel carrying a continuous loop of standard ¼ inch plastic oxide-coated recording tape running at 3¾ inches/second (9.5 cm/s). Program starts and stops were signalled either by a conductive foil splice or sub-audible tones. The tape was {{pulled from the}} center of the reel, passed across the opening at the end of the cartridge and wound back onto the outside of the same <b>reel.</b> The <b>spool</b> itself was freewheeling and the tape was driven only by tension from the capstan. George Eash, also of Toledo, an inventor who had rented space in Cousino's building in the 1950s, later revised Cousino's design (1954, receiving a patent in January 1957) and marketed it under the name Fidelipac. These cartridges were first used in radio stations (broadcast cartridges) from 1959 on to program commercials and single song hits.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{a variety}} of methods are used to fish for tarpons (bait, lure, and fly on spinning, conventional, or fly rod), the method that has {{garnered}} the most acclaim is flats-fishing with a fly rod. It is a sport akin to hunting, combining the best elements of hunting with fishing. A normal tarpon fly rod outfit uses 10-12 weight rods and <b>reels,</b> <b>spooled</b> with appropriate line and using a class leader tippet of 12 - 20 lb; truly light tackle fishing where the fish may weigh 10 times or more than the breaking strength of the leader. Typically, an angler stations himself on the bow of a shallow-water boat known as a 'flats skiff', and {{with the aid of a}} guide, searches for incoming tarpon on the flats (inshore shallow areas of the ocean, typically no more than 3 - 4 ft deep). When a school of tarpons are sighted, the guide positions the boat to intercept the fish. The angler usually has no more than six to 10 seconds to false cast out enough flyline and make an accurate cast to these fast-moving fish. Accuracy and speed are paramount, but the task is compounded by the inevitable excitement and nervousness of seeing a school of fish that may top 180 lb bearing down on the angler. Once the cast is made, the fly is retrieved and hopefully a tarpon inhales the fly. The hookset is difficult due to the hard mouth of the fish, which has been likened to the hardness of concrete, so many tarpons throw the hook on the first few jumps; many times an angler is asked, [...] "how many tarpons did you jump?" [...] rather than how many they caught. If the hook stays secure, then the fight is on. Tarpons have tremendous endurance and are one of the most exciting gamefish to fight - frequent spectacular jumps, long runs, and stubborn bulldogging are all part of the game. Although an experienced and skillful tarpon angler can usually land a tarpon in less than an hour, the average angler usually takes longer, from one to more than three hours.|$|R
50|$|Winders have {{a center}} roll (a bobbin, <b>spool,</b> <b>reel,</b> belt-winding shell, etc.) {{on which the}} {{material}} is wound up. Often there are metal bars that travel {{through the center of}} the roll, and are shaped according to their intended purpose. A circular bar facilitates greater speed, while a square bar provides a greater potential for torque. Edge sensors are used to sense how full the center roll is. They are mounted on adjustable slides to accommodate many different widths, as the width increases as the center roll is filled. The sensitivity of the sensor depends on the required speed of operation.|$|R
2500|$|Fixed <b>spool</b> <b>reels</b> {{are cast}} by opening the bail, {{grasping}} {{the line with}} the forefinger, and then using a backward snap of the rod followed by a forward cast while releasing the line with the forefinger at the same time. [...] The forefinger is then placed {{in contact with the}} departing line and {{the leading edge of the}} spool in order to slow or stop the outward cast. [...] On the retrieve, the left hand normally operates the crank handle, while the large rotating wire cage or bail (either manually or trigger-operated) serves as the line pickup, restoring the line to its original position on the spool.|$|R
50|$|Anglers either use an uptide rod between 9 and 10 feet {{in length}} to cast from the boat or a shorter downtide rod between 6 and 8 feet. Lines are usually between 18 pounds and 50 pounds {{breaking}} strain dependent on the species of fish being targeted. Reels are usually multipliers, although fixed <b>spool</b> <b>reels</b> are being used more and more. Baits {{are similar to those}} used for beach and rock fishing except they are often larger since larger fish are targeted. The species will include all the beach species, but now also include big conger eels and small sharks like tope and smoothhound.|$|R
50|$|The divers of {{the group}} are {{informed}} of the intention to ascend, using the thumb up hand signal, and if not already neutrally buoyant, will adjust their buoyancy, and hold the inflator mechanism ready to dump excess gas from the BCD as it expands during the ascent. Increased buoyancy of the BCD and dive suit due to gas expansion could cause a runaway ascent so air is vented as the divers ascend to retain approximately neutral buoyancy. The divers frequently look upwards while ascending to avoid any obstacles. A competent diver will ascend {{with little or no}} need to fin upwards, and can stop and achieve neutral buoyancy at any depth. The diver handling the buoy may choose to remain slightly negative during the ascent to keep a small amount of tension on the line as it is wound onto the <b>reel</b> or <b>spool.</b> Ascent speed is limited to the requirement of the decompression schedule in use - (commonly kept below 10 meters per minute) so that dissolved inert gases can be eliminated safely. A dive computer may be used to help judge this speed.|$|R
2500|$|Spinning reels, {{also called}} fixed <b>spool</b> <b>reels,</b> were {{in use in}} North America {{as early as the}} 1870s. [...] They were {{originally}} developed to allow the use of artificial flies, or other lures for trout or salmon, that were too light in weight to be easily cast by bait casting reels. [...] Fixed-spool or spinning reels are normally mounted below the rod; this positioning conforms to gravity, requiring no wrist strength to maintain the reel in position. [...] For right-handed persons, the spinning rod is held and cast by the strong right hand, leaving the left hand free to operate the crank handle mounted {{on the left side of}} the reel. [...] Invention of the fixed-spool or spinning reel solved the problem of backlash, since the reel had no rotating spool capable of overrunning and fouling the line.|$|R
30|$|Fishing {{for live}} medium sized Scombrids was {{performed}} during the Australian summer and autumn months, between December and May, when large schools of pelagic fish migrate through the Sunshine Coast region in QLD, Australia. Rod and line fishing was {{the method of}} choice, using artificial lures (mainly metal slugs, 10 – 20  g), that were cast towards the surface of feeding schools. Medium-light spinning rods and <b>reels</b> were used, <b>spooled</b> with a 20  lb Dacron braid line and a 3  m long 25  lb fluorocarbon leader. The lures varied in size (35 – 60  mm) and in colour (reflecting white/blue/silver), to specifically match the baitfish that the fish were feeding upon. Single barbless hooks and long nosed pliers were used to ensure easy and fast release of the fish into the tubes when caught and to minimise handling and potential injury to the fish. Feeding schools were visualized by presence of tern and seagull flocks that were feeding on bait fish schools. Feeding fish were approached carefully {{in order to avoid}} any disturbance to the fish and the bait; specifically, the boat was positioned upwind a feeding school and then the engine was idled, so that the boat would drift quietly towards the feeding fish. Once in casting range (10 – 20  m), lures were cast towards the fish and quickly retrieved. Hooked fish were brought to the surface as soon as possible, landed using a “fish friendly”, knotless rubber net (Environet, Shimano) or a PVC sling lubricated with water based gel, unhooked while maintaining minimal contact with the skin of the fish and placed head first in the tuna tubes.|$|R
40|$|Transport {{properties}} {{of a standard}} compact - cassette tape system are measured and software techniques devised to configure a low - cost,direct digital recording system. Tape - velocity variation is typically ± 10 % of standard speed over tape lengths of 5 µm. with occasional variations of ± 40 %. Static tape - skew can result due to axial movement of the tape <b>reel</b> when it <b>spools.</b> Dynamic tape skew occurs and is primarily caused by tape - edge curvature with a constant contribution due to the transport mechanism. Spectral skew components range from 0. 32 Hz to 8 Hz with magnitude normally within one 10 kbit/ sec- bit cell. The pinch roller works against the friction of the tape guides to cause tape deformation. Average values of tape deformation are 0. 67 µm, 0. 85 µm and 1. 08 µm for C 60,C 90 and C 120 tape respectively. Parallel,software encoding / decoding algorithms {{have been developed for}} several channel codes. Adaptive software methods permit track data rates up to 3. 33 k bits/sec in a rnultitrack system using a simple microcomputer. For a 4 - track system,raw error rates vary from 10 ˉ⁷ at 500 bits/sec/track to 10 ˉ⁵ at 3. 33 kbits/sec/track. Adaptive software reduces skew - induced errors by 50 %. A skew - correction technique has been developed and implemented on an 8 - track system at a track data rate of 10 k bits/sec. Real - time error correction gives a theoretical corrected error rate of 10 ˉ¹¹for a raw error rate of 10 ˉ⁷. Multiple track errors can cause mis - correction and interleaving is advised. Software algorithms have been devised for Reed - Solomon code. With a more powerful microprocessor this code m ay be combined with the above techniques in a layered error-correction scheme. The software techniques developed may be applied to N tracks with an N - bit computer. Recording density may be increased by using thin - film,multitrack heads and a faster computer.

50|$|Rock Angling as {{the name}} {{suggests}} usually entails the angler fishing from a rock ledge or outcrop on the shore. This will usually allow the angler access to deeper water than from the beach, which usually means more fish. Fishing from rock ledges and outcrops can be very dangerous and should never be done alone, as anglers each year are swept off rocks {{by the power of}} the sea and some of these are swept to their deaths. An angler rock fishing will usually use a rod of between 10 and 11 feet when fishing from rocks although the full Beach Casters of 12 to 14 feet may be used when distance casting is required or a stiff rod is required due to rough ground. It is usual that only short casting is required from rocks to catch fish as they tend to be close in trying to feed of crabs and other animals. Again the angler may use a fixed <b>spool</b> <b>reel</b> or a multiplier reel loaded with line from as little as 8 pound (float fishing) to 30 pounds over rough ground. When fishing from rocks several different methods can be used such as bait fishing, spinning/plugging and float fishing. Bait fishing will be much the same as from the beach but the most common bait would now be peeler crab and hard back crab. Spinning/plugging involves casting an artificial lure or plug and retrieving it to induce a fish to 'take' attack the lure or plug. Whilst float fishing is simply suspending a bait usually a rag worm, sand eel of prawn below a float. The species of fish targeted will be the same as from the beach but will include species such as Ballan Wrasse.Species varie from coast to coast, but the main species from rock marks are conger eels, various species of ray, tope, cod, bass and bullhuss.A rotten bottom system is commonly used among professional anglers looking to cut down on tackle losses due to rocky snags.|$|R
5000|$|Song Yingxing {{opened his}} chapter on {{clothing}} with {{the aspects of}} sericulture in producing silk. He gave an accurate description of the raising of silkworms, along with their instinctual mating tradition. Those raising the silkworms had their eggs deposited on sheets of paper or cloth, and stored {{for use in the}} following year. He wrote that in some regions a bathing process was used on these sheets, employing rain water, lime water, or brine, and gave specifications on the timing for this during winter, in the 12th month of the year. The reason for this, he said, was so that the inferior eggs would die in the process, hence less mulberry leaves would be consumed needlessly. He also provided specifications on how to avoid damaging the eggs in the long process of preparation before the bathing process in the 12th month. He noted the differences between two general forms of silkworms, late and early, while providing information on a wide variety in different silkworm breeds and cocoons, and even silkworm diseases. After their eventful hatching, he described the proper living conditions and environment that the silkworms should be immersed in, as well as the care that should be given in feeding them. He warned of different sources of foul odors and smoke that had the capability of killing the silkworms if they came into contact. He described the spinning of cocoons, gathering of cocoons, sorting of cocoons, and the different pests such as birds and mosquitoes that should be avoided, He also described the proper planting of mulberry trees and how to harvest them. For the process of making silk, he noted that raw silk could not be reeled into normal silk until a formal wadding process was done.
