5|$|Author Raven Grimassi {{has written}} {{extensively}} about Aradia in his popularization of Stregheria, presenting what he admits is his own personal <b>rendering</b> <b>of</b> her story.

5|$|Barvai Ramayana (बरवै रामायण, 1612), {{literally}} The Ramayana in Barvai metre, is an abridged <b>rendering</b> <b>of</b> the Ramayana in Awadhi.

Many episodes of the Ramayana are elaborated while many others are abridged.|$|E
5|$|Nirjarā is {{possible}} through tapas, austerities and penances. Tapas {{can be either}} external or internal. Six forms of external tapas are—fasting, control of appetite, accepting food under certain conditions, renunciation of delicious food, sitting and sleeping in lonely place and renunciation of comforts. Six forms of internal tapas are—atonement, reverence, <b>rendering</b> <b>of</b> service to worthy ones, spiritual study, avoiding selfish feelings and meditation.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the works}} created {{during the war}} was Yakov Knyazhnin's tragedy Olga (1772). The Russian playwright chose to {{introduce}} Sviatoslav as his protagonist, although his active participation in the events following Igor's death is {{out of sync with}} the traditional chronology. Knyazhnin's rival Nikolai Nikolev (1758–1815) also wrote a play on the subject of Sviatoslav's life. Ivan Akimov's painting Sviatoslav's Return from the Danube to Kiev (1773) explores the conflict between military honour and family attachment. It is a vivid example of Poussinesque <b>rendering</b> <b>of</b> early medieval subject matter.|$|E

5|$|Art {{historian}} Charles de Tolnay believed that, {{through the}} seductive gaze of Adam, the left panel already shows God's waning influence upon {{the newly created}} earth. This view {{is reinforced by the}} <b>rendering</b> <b>of</b> God in the outer panels as a tiny figure in comparison to the immensity of the earth. According to Belting, the three inner panels seek to broadly convey the Old Testament notion that, before the Fall, there was no defined boundary between good and evil; humanity in its innocence was unaware of consequence.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of King Edward the Confessor a lady called Elviva (probably a Latin <b>rendering</b> <b>of</b> the Old English name Ælfgifu), held the manor of Ambrosden. The Domesday Book records that by 1086 she had been {{replaced}} by Hugh d'Ivry, butler of William the Conqueror and brother of Roger d'Ivry, who owned several manors in Oxfordshire. Hugh's nephew Roger II d'Ivry inherited Ambrosden and by 1194 {{it was part of the}} Honour of St. Valery. Ambrosden thus passed to Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall, who in 1288 gave the manor to Ashridge Priory of the Augustinian order of the Brothers of Penitence. Ashridge Priory retained Ambrosden until the priory was dissolved in 1539 in the Dissolution of the Monasteries.|$|E
5|$|Earlier travels had exposed Géricault {{to victims}} of {{insanity}} and plague, and while researching the Méduse his effort to be historically accurate and realistic led to an obsession with the stiffness of corpses. To achieve the most authentic <b>rendering</b> <b>of</b> the flesh tones of the dead, he made sketches of bodies in the morgue of the Hospital Beaujon, studied the faces of dying hospital patients, brought severed limbs back to his studio to study their decay, and for a fortnight drew a severed head, borrowed from a lunatic asylum and stored on his studio roof.|$|E

5|$|In August 1919, the Sejm (lower {{house of}} parliament) of the renascent Republic of Poland adopted a law {{defining}} the Banner of the Republic of Poland (chorągiew Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej). The banner {{was part of}} the insignia of the head of statethe State Leader (Naczelnik Państwa) and, later, President of the Republic. It was plain red emblazoned with the crowned White Eagle and bordered with a wężyk generalski, a wavy line used in the Polish military as a symbol of general's rank. It was modified on December 27, 1927 to reflect the adoption of a new official <b>rendering</b> <b>of</b> the national coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|Lochner {{probably}} saw van Eyck's c. 1432 Ghent Altarpiece {{during his}} visit to the Netherlands and seems to have borrowed a number of its compositional elements. The similarities include {{the manner in which the}} figures engage with their space and the emphasis on and <b>rendering</b> <b>of</b> elements such as brocades, gems and metals. Some figures in Lochner's paintings are directly borrowed from Ghent, and a number of facial features match those seen in van Eyck. His Virgin with the Violet has often been compared to van Eyck's 1439 Virgin at the Fountain. Similarly to those in van Eyck's work, Lochner's angels often sing or play musical instruments, including lutes and organs.|$|E
5|$|On 7 January 1904 Joyce {{attempted}} to publish A Portrait of the Artist, an essay-story dealing with aesthetics, {{only to have}} it rejected by the free-thinking magazine Dana. He decided, on his twenty-second birthday, to revise the story into a novel he called Stephen Hero. It was a fictional <b>rendering</b> <b>of</b> Joyce's youth, but he eventually grew frustrated with its direction and abandoned this work. It was never published in this form, but years later, in Trieste, Joyce completely rewrote it as A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. The unfinished Stephen Hero was published after his death.|$|E

5|$|Rapunzel is {{the tenth}} {{member of the}} Disney Princess line-up, a {{marketing}} franchise aimed primarily at young girls that manufactures and releases products such as toys, video and audio recordings, clothing, and video games. The Walt Disney Company introduces characters into its Disney Princess line-up through coronation. Rapunzel's was held on October 2, 2011, at the Kensington Palace in London, England; the character became the franchise's first princess to have been computer-animated. However, the franchise uses a traditionally animated <b>rendering</b> <b>of</b> Rapunzel in most of its merchandise. Following her coronation, Rapunzel was recognized with her own page on the official Disney Princess website.|$|E
5|$|Ruisdael's {{work from}} c. 1646 {{to the early}} 1650s, when {{he was living in}} Haarlem, is characterised by simple motifs and careful and {{laborious}} study of nature: dunes, woods, and atmospheric effects. By applying heavier paint than his predecessors, Ruisdael gave his foliage a rich quality, conveying a sense of sap flowing through branches and leaves. His accurate <b>rendering</b> <b>of</b> trees was unprecedented at the time: the genera of his trees are the first to be unequivocally recognisable by modern-day botanists. His early sketches introduce motifs that would return in all his work: a sense of spaciousness and luminosity, and an airy atmosphere achieved through pointillist-like touches of chalk. Most of his thirty black chalk sketches that survive date from this period.|$|E
5|$|The {{designs of}} most of these flags have been {{modified}} only {{to adjust to the}} changes in the official <b>rendering</b> <b>of</b> the national coat of arms. Major modifications included a change in the stylization of the eagle from Neoclassicist to Baroque in 1927 and the removal of the crown from the eagle's head during the Communist rule from 1944 to 1990. Legal specification for the shades of the national colors has also changed with time. The shade of red was first legally specified as vermilion by a presidential decree of 13 December 1928.|$|E

5|$|The figures, the {{minutely}} detailed clothes, and {{the architecture}} of the room and windows are depicted {{with a high degree of}} realism. Van Eyck's mastery at handling oil can be seen in the differing breadths of brush strokes. The precision of the detail achieved is especially noticeable in the <b>rendering</b> <b>of</b> threads of St. Donatian's blue and golden embroidered cope and mitre, in the weave of the oriental carpet, and in the stubble and veins on van der Paele's aging face.|$|E

On its gold-outlined blue border, there are 16 stars, representing the mission number, and the names of the crew members: Young, Mattingly, Duke. The insignia was designed from ideas originally submitted by the crew of the mission.|$|E

It is likely that Ovid relied upon Greek and Latin sources that were available in his era such as the Bibliotheca of Pseudo-Apollodorus (2nd century BC), or sources that are no longer extant or exist today only in fragments—especially Sophocles' tragic drama Tereus (5th century BC).|$|E
