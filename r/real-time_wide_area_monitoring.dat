The secure and reliable operation of modern power systems is an increasingly challenging task due to the ever-increasing demand for electricity, the growing number of interconnections, penetration of variable renewable energy sources, and deregulated energy market conditions.

40|$|Abstract—Low {{frequency}} power oscillations may {{be triggered}} by many events in the system. Most oscillations are damped by the system, but undamped oscillations can lead to system collapse. Oscillations develop {{as a result of}} rotor acceleration/deceleration following a change in active power transfer from a generator. Like the operations limits, the monitoring of power system oscillating modes is a relevant aspect of power system operation and control. Unprevented low-frequency power swings can be cause of cascading outages that can rapidly extend effect on wide region. On this regard, a <b>Wide</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Monitoring,</b> Protection and Control Systems (WAMPCS) help in detecting such phenomena and assess power system dynamics security.

In this paper, a generic architecture of CNN is presented and a special case of supervised learning has been demonstrated explaining the internal components of a cell. A decentralized asynchronous learning (DAL) framework for CNN is developed in which each cell of the CNN learns in a spatially and temporally distributed environment.

40|$|This Working Group is {{a sequel}} to a {{previous}} working group on <b>Wide</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Monitoring</b> and Control for Transmission Capability Enhancement, which published the Technical Brochure 330 in 2007. Since then the synchrophasor technology has advanced rapidly and many utilities {{around the world have}} installed hundreds of PMUs in their networks. In this Technical Brochure, we look at {{the current state of the}} technology and the extent to which it has been used in the industry. As the technology has matured, it is also important to understand the communication protocols used in synchrophasor networks and their relevant cyber-security issues. These concerns are briefly discussed in the brochure. The applications of Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) measurements reported here are divided into three categories: (a) applications already installed in utility networks, (b) applications that are well-tested, but not yet installed, and (c) applications that are beneficial to the industry, but not fully developed yet. The most common and mature applications are <b>wide</b> <b>area</b> <b>monitoring,</b> state estimation, and model validation. Out of these three applications, <b>wide</b> <b>area</b> <b>monitoring</b> is well established in the industry. The protection and control applications are emerging as evident from the reported examples. The experience of using remote synchrophasor measurements as feedback control signals is not widely reported by the industry. In parallel to this Working Group, Study Committee B 5 had a Working Group on “Wide area protection and control technologies. ” The Technical Brochure 664 published by this Working Group in September 2016 reviews synchrophasor technology and discusses the industry experience with <b>wide</b> <b>area</b> protection and control. The North American synchrophasor Initiative (NASPI) is another technical group that has gathered and reported a wide range of PMU experiences of industry and researchers. In summary, the field-tested applications presented in this Technical Brochure are a testimony to the confidence of utilities in the synchrophasor technology. The progress in state estimation techniques indicates that synchrophasor measurements will become a standard part of energy management and security assessment systems in the near future...|$|R
