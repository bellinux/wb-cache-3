5|$|The 2007 {{banknote}} series was {{prepared by the}} Reserve Bank in October 2006 for the abandoned second phase of Operation Sunrise. The Chiremba Balancing Rocks was to be reinstated as the main feature on the obverse whilst use of the Zimbabwe Bird watermark continued. There were additional security features as opposed to previous issues, which included security threads, see-through <b>register</b> <b>marks</b> and recognition marks for the partially sighted. Holographic security threads and Optically Variable Ink were used on the $100, $500 and $1000 notes. When the redenomination of 1 August 2008 occurred these notes were put into circulation as banknotes of the third dollar between 1 August 2008 to 31 December 2008.|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} the {{institution}} dates back to January 1899. On 25 January 1899 a historic fire {{took place on the}} lot currently occupied by the High School. The fire is known as the [...] "Fuego del Polvorín" [...] (the Fire of the Ammunitions Depot). At that time the lot was used as a U.S. Army ammunitions depot. Today a <b>register</b> <b>marks</b> the location of the fire. In November 1899, the new American government authorized the establishment of a public secondary school in Ponce modeled after the American school system. In 1903 the Roosevelt Industrial School was built on land where the US military had its munitions depot that caused the fire. [...] Five years after El Polvorin, in the 1904-1905 timeframe, a two-story building with 12 classrooms was built to accommodate the Ruiz Gandia Grammar School in the same spacious El Polvorin lot. The first class of Ponce High School students formed in 1902. As new facilities were completed, the students were moved to them. For the 1907-1908 school year another building was built called the McKinley building, and the Ponce High students occupied said facilities as well. Construction of the now-historic Ponce High School building on Cristina Street started in 1915 and the building was inaugurated in 1920.|$|E

50|$|Chromolithography is a {{chemical}} process. The process {{is based on}} the rejection of grease by water. The image is applied to stone, grained zinc or aluminium surfaces, with a grease-based crayon or ink. Limestone and zinc are two commonly used materials in the production of chromolithographs, as aluminium unfortunately corrodes easily. After the image is drawn onto one of these surfaces, the image is gummed-up with a gum arabic solution and weak nitric acid to desensitize the surface. Before printing, the image is proved before finally inking up the image with oil based transfer or printing ink. The inked image under pressure is transposed onto a sheet of paper using a flat-bed press. This describes the direct form of printing. The offset indirect method uses a rubber-covered cylinder that transfers the image from printing surface to the paper. Colours may be overprinted by using additional stones or plates to achieve a closer reproduction of the original. Accurate registration for multi-coloured work is achieved by the use of a key outline image and registration bars which are applied to each stone or plate before drawing the solid or tone image. Ben-Day medium, uses a raised gelatin stipple image to give tone gradation. An air-brush sprays ink to give soft edges. These are just two methods used to achieve gradations of tone. The use of twelve overprinted colours would not be considered unusual. Each sheet of paper will therefore pass through the printing press as many times as there are colours in the final print. In order that each colour is placed in the right position, each stone or plate must be precisely ‘registered,’ or lined up, on the paper using a system of <b>register</b> <b>marks.</b>|$|E
40|$|Register {{control of}} roll-to-roll {{printing}} system for printed electronics requires accurate measurement of register errors. The <b>register</b> <b>marks</b> {{used for the}} recognition of patterns position between layers have inherently defects due to low printability of <b>register</b> <b>marks</b> themselves, which brings out inaccurate register accuracy and consequently low performance of printed electronics devices. In this study, the compensation methods for the unrecognized or missing register data are proposed to improve the recognition and consequently the control performance of register accuracy in roll-to-roll printing equipment. The compensation methods using the prior data and the linear interpolation are proposed and compared with the case without compensation for the simulation as well as experiment. Only the linear interpolation method could successfully compensate the missing data and consequently improve the register control performance. We should apply the compensation process of the register errors to improve the register control accuracy in the roll-to-roll printing equipment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this paper, a {{real time}} quality {{monitoring}} and control in multicolor printing is proposed using online mechatronic system based on computer vision. Theoretical and practical study for automatic detection of <b>register</b> <b>marks</b> through an adaptive threshold value selection algorithm. The proposed system provides an automatic control of the press machine {{to be able to}} quantify and compensate the miss-registration happens in printing setup or during operation. The proposed mechatronic system uses a CMOS image sensor to capture the printed register mark image data in real time. Further image processing and analyzing is carried out under MATLAB environment. The color segmentation algorithm involves an adaptive threshold value selection technique to enhance the overall system performance. The geometrical color to color deviation is compensated through DC motor controlled by the decision making algorithm. The system was applied to a pen plotter as a simulation of press machine and succeeded to achieve the required task...|$|E
