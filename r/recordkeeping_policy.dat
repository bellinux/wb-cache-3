50|$|Queensland State Archives {{develops}} <b>recordkeeping</b> <b>policy</b> {{and provides}} advice to public authorities on {{the management of}} public records and facilitates access to information about government {{for the people of}} Queensland.|$|E
50|$|Queensland State Archives is {{established}} under section 21 of the Public Records Act 2002 (the Act) as the State's archives and records management authority. With {{the introduction of}} the Act, Queensland State Archives became the lead agency for State and local government recordkeeping in Queensland. The Act and its accompanying Recordkeeping Information Standards enable Queensland State Archives to develop and implement a comprehensive <b>recordkeeping</b> <b>policy</b> framework to ensure a consistent approach to the creation, management, disposal, storage, preservation, and retrieval of government information.|$|E
50|$|The RCM is an {{abstract}} conceptual model {{that helps to}} understand and explore recordkeeping activities (as interaction) in relation to multiple contexts over space and time (spacetime). Recordkeeping activities take place from before the records are created by identifying <b>recordkeeping</b> requirements in <b>policies,</b> systems, organizations, processes, laws, social mandates that impact on what is created {{and how it is}} managed over spacetime. In a continuum, recordkeeping processes, such as adding metadata, fix documents {{so that they can be}} managed as evidence. Those records deemed as having continuing value are retained and managed as an archive. The implication of an RCM approach to records and archives is that systems and processes can be designed and put in place before records are even created. A continuum approach therefore highlights that records are both current and archival at the point of creation.|$|R
40|$|Building upon recent work, {{this paper}} {{demonstrates}} how 21 st century recordkeeping concerns are integral to societal grand challenges {{that have been}} identified by governments, think tanks, scholarly organisations and affected communities around the globe. Using the example of forced displacement and migration the paper focuses on ways in which recordkeeping is inextricably linked to both the causes and possible digital, policy and educational mechanisms for addressing certain aspects of societal grand challenges. These linkages are significantly under-explored and under-addressed in our field. The paper's principal arguments are that archives and recordkeepers have social and ethical responsibilities toward those individuals who are least empowered to engage with official records and recordkeeping practices or to maintain their own records; and that responding will require implementing archival and <b>recordkeeping</b> practices and <b>policy</b> at supra-national and meta-archival levels. The paper suggests some actions and reconceptualisations therefore, that might move us in that direction...|$|R
