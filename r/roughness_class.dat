The objective {{of this study was to}} compare several existing soil {{surface roughness}} indices and to test the use of the revised triangular prism surface area method (RTPM) to calculate the fractal dimension as a roughness index. A silty clay loam soil was sampled, sieved to four aggregate sizes, and each size was packed in soil trays in order to derive four different soil surface <b>roughness</b> <b>classes.</b> Rainfall simulations using an oscillating nozzle simulator were conducted for 90 min at 50. 2 mm h- 1 average intensity. The surface microtopography was digitized by an instantaneous profile laser scanner before and after the rainfall application. Calculated roughness indices included random roughness, variogram sill and range, fractal dimension and fractal length using a fractional Brownian motion (fBm) model, variance and correlation length according to a Markov-Gaussian model, and fractal dimension using the RTPM. Random roughness is shown to be the best estimator to significantly distinguish soil surface <b>roughness</b> <b>classes.</b> When taking spatial dependency into account, the variogram sill was the best alternative. The fractal dimension calculated from the fBm model did not yield good results, as only short-range variations were incorporated. The MG variance described the large-scale roughness better than the parameters of the fBm model did. The fractal dimension from the RTPM performed well, although it could not significantly discriminate between all <b>roughness</b> <b>classes.</b> Since it covered a greater range of scales, we believe that it is a good estimator of the overall roughness...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{roughness}} crucially {{affects the}} hydrological and erosive behaviours of soils. In agricultural areas surface roughness {{is directly related}} to tillage, whose action strongly affects the key physical properties of soils and determines the occurrence and fate of several processes (e. g., surface storage, infiltration, etc.). The characterisation of surface roughness as a result of tillage operations is not straightforward, and numerous parameters and indices have been proposed for quantifying it. In this article, a database of 164 profiles (each 5 m long), measured in 5 different <b>roughness</b> <b>classes,</b> was analysed. Four <b>roughness</b> <b>classes</b> corresponded to typical tillage operations (i. e., mouldboard, harrow, seedbed, etc.), and the fifth represented a seedbed soil that was subject to rainfall. The aim of the research was to evaluate and select the surface roughness parameters that best characterised and quantified the surface roughness caused by typical tillage operations. In total, 21 roughness parameters (divided into 4 categories) were assessed. The parameters that best separated and characterised the different <b>roughness</b> <b>classes</b> were the limiting elevation difference (LD) and the Mean Upslope Depression index (MUD); however, the parameters most sensitive to rainfall action on seedbed soils were limiting slope (LS) and the crossover lengths measured with the semivariogram method (lSMV) and the root mean square method (lRMS). Many parameters had high degrees of correlation with each other, and therefore gave almost identical information. The results of this study may contribute {{to the understanding of the}} surface roughness phenomenon and its parameterisation in agricultural soils.

40|$|A {{database}} {{composed of}} 673 natural rainfall events with sediment concentration measurements {{at the field}} or plot scale was analysed. Measurements were conducted on similar soil type (loess soils prone to scaling phenomenon) to apprehend the variability and complexity involved in interrill erosion processes attributable to soil surface conditions. The effects of the dominant controlling factors are not described by means of equations; rather, we established a classification of potential sediment concentration domain according to combination of the dominant parameters. Thereby, significant differences and evolution trends of mean sediment concentration between the different parameter categories are identified. Further, when parameter influences interact, {{it allows us to}} discern the relative effects of factors according to their respective degree of expression. It was shown that crop cover had a major influence on mean sediment concentration, particularly when soil surface roughness is low and when maximum 6 -min intensity of rainfall events exceeds 10 mm h(- 1) : mean sediment concentration decreases from 8. 93 g l(- 1) for 0 - 20 per cent of coverage to 0. 97 g l(- 1) for 21 - 60 per cent of coverage. The established classification also indicates that the increase of the maximum 6 -min intensity of the rainfall factor leads to a linear increase of mean sediment concentration for crop cover over 21 per cent (e. g. from 2. 96 g l(- 1) to 14. 44 g l(- 1) for the 1 - 5 cm <b>roughness</b> <b>class)</b> and to an exponential increase for low crop cover (e. g. from 3. 92 g l(- 1) to 58 - 76 g l(- 1) for the 1 - 5 cm <b>roughness</b> <b>class).</b> The implication of this work may bring perspective for erosion prediction modelling and give references for the development of interrill erosion equation.

Periodic monitoring of bridges is therefore {{a key part of}} any maintenance strategy as it can give early warning if a bridge becomes unsafe. This article investigates an alternative method for the monitoring of bridge dynamic behaviour: a truck–trailer vehicle system, with accelerometers fitted to the axles of the trailer. The method aims to detect changes in the damping of a bridge, which may indicate the existence of damage. A simplified vehicle–bridge interaction model is used in theoretical simulations to assess the effectiveness of the method in detecting those changes. The influence of road profile roughness on the vehicle vibration is overcome by recording accelerations from both axles of a trailer and then analysing the spectra of the difference in the accelerations between the two axles. The effectiveness of the approach in detecting damage simulated as a loss in stiffness is also investigated. In addition, the sensitivity of the approach to the vehicle speed, road <b>roughness</b> <b>class,</b> bridge span length, changes in the equal axle properties and noise is investigated...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{focuses on}} providing reliable spatial information in support of tsunami risk and vulnerability assessment {{within the framework of}} the German-Indonesian Tsunami Early Warning System (GITEWS) project. It contributes to three major components of the project: (1) the provision of spatial information on surface roughness as an important parameter for tsunami inundation modeling and hazard assessment; (2) the modeling of population distribution, which is an essential factor in tsunami vulnerability assessment and local disaster management activities; and (3) the settlement detection and classification from remote sensing radar imagery to support the population distribution research. Regarding the surface roughness determination, research analyses on surface <b>roughness</b> <b>classes</b> and their coefficients have been conducted. This included the development of remote sensing classification techniques to derive surface <b>roughness</b> <b>classes,</b> and integration of the thus derived spatial information on surface roughness conditions to tsunami inundation modeling. This research determined 12 <b>classes</b> of surface <b>roughness</b> and their respective coefficients based on analyses of published values. The developed method for surface roughness classification of remote sensing data considered density and neighborhood conditions, and resulted in more than 90 % accuracy. The classification method consists of two steps: main land use classification and density and neighborhood analysis. First, the main land uses were defined and a classification was performed applying decision tree modeling. Texture parameters played an important role in increasing the classification accuracy. The density and neighborhood analysis further substantiated the classification result towards identifying surface <b>roughness</b> <b>classes.</b> Different classes such as residential areas and trees were combined to new surface <b>roughness</b> <b>classes,</b> as “residential areas with trees”. The density and neighborhood analysis led to an appropriate representation of real surface roughness conditions. This was used as an important input for tsunami inundation modeling. By using Tohoku University’s Analysis Model for Investigation Near-field Tsunami Number 3 (TUNAMI N 3), the spatially distributed surface roughness information was integrated in tsunami inundation modeling and compared to the modeling results applying a uniform surface roughness condition. An uncertainty analysis of tsunami inundation modeling based on the variation of surface roughness coefficients in the Cilacap study area was also undertaken. It was demonstrated that the inundation modeling results applying uniform and spatially distributed surface roughness resulted in high differences of inundation lengths, especially in areas far from the coastline. This result showed the important role of surface roughness conditions in resisting tsunami flow, which must be considered in tsunami inundation modeling. With respect to the second research focus, the population distribution, a concept of population distribution modeling was developed. Within the modeling process, weighting factor determination, multi-scale disaggregation and a comparative study to other methods were conducted. The basis of the developed method was a combination of census and land use data, which led to an improved spatial resolution and accuracy of the population distribution. Socio-economic data were used to derive weighting factors to distributing people to land use classes. Moreover, in case of missing input data, an approach was developed that allows for the determination of generalized weighting factors. The approach to use specific weightings, where possible and generalized ones, where necessary, led to a flexible methodology with respect to the achievable accuracy and availability of data. A comparative study was performed by comparing this new model with previously developed population distribution models. The newly developed model showed a higher accuracy. The detailed population distribution information was a valuable input for the vulnerability assessment being the main data source for human exposure assessment and an important contribution to evacuation time modeling. In support of the population distribution research, settlement classification using TerraSAR-X imagery was conducted. A current classification method of speckle divergence analysis on SAR imagery was further developed and improved by including the neighborhood concept. The settlement classification provided highly accurate results in dense urban areas, whereas the method needs to be further developed and improved for rural settlement areas. Finally, it has been shown how the results of this research can be applied. These applications cover the integration of surface roughness conditions into the tsunami inundation modeling and hazard mapping. The contributions to tsunami vulnerability assessment and evacuation planning were shown. Additionally, the results were integrated into the decision support system of the Tsunami Early Warning Center in Jakarta...|$|R
40|$|Estimations of {{the local}} {{roughness}} of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) have been used both for a better geological understanding of terrain structures and for a more accurate DEM interpolation leading to higher resolution terrain maps. This work investigates two fractal dimension estimators for the characterization of the roughness of DEMs: the power spectrum estimator and the wavelet-based estimator. The performance of these methods is compared in terms of image segmentation capabilities. Since wavelets and fractals are related by the same multiresolution concept, we expect to have better results using the wavelet analysis method. This expectation is confirmed by experiments on synthetic images and real DEMs: measurements of fractal parameters using wavelet-based methods are more reliable than the same measurements performed using other methods.

40|$|Due to {{specifics}} of structure and properties of {{some kinds of}} polymer fibrous composites (organoplastics, hybrid materials containing organofiberes etc.), when cutting, a hairiness of cut fibrous material and a property damage of surface appear on the machined surface, thereby substantially restricting achievable classes of surface quality, i. e. surface roughness, material condition of the surface layer, dimensional accuracy, etc. These features of polymer composite materials (PCM) allow their referring to a special group of hard-to-cut materials, which requires creation and use of unconventional machining methods and tools to provide high-quality treatment and desirable engineering and economic indicators. The BMSTU has developed a clean finishing method of PCM, i. e. cutting with an additional technological coating (ATC). A principle of the method is that the two-pass machining in the finish size is provided. The first cutting tool pass provides processing in the pre-finish size of the product surface; then the hairiness appeared after machining is bound by applying a curing technological coating, and the second (finishing) pass in the final size removes a tightly binderheld hairiness together with cured temporary coating. This allows us to reduce roughness, significantly reduce dimensions and number of defects of the surface layer. However, {{the time required to}} cure the temporary coating before the second (final) pass of a cutting tool results in lower production rates of finishing with ATC, reduced performance rate, and higher product cost. Increased performance rate in ATC cutting, with the same high quality of the processed surfaces of fibrous composites, has been achieved by reducing the curing time of coating that can be realized in different ways. It has been experimentally established that under optimum processing conditions high quality of surface (<b>roughness</b> <b>class</b> of 7 - 8) and substantially reduced curing time of coating, i. e. the time interval between preliminary and final tool passes are achieved through the temperature control of ATC curing. Thus, the coating heated from 20 °C to 120 °C provides 18 times reduction of its curing time. Time of ATC cutting operation can be lessened more through pre-curing of technological coating on the site where components are mixed before applying it on the product to be cut. Changing weight ratio between the epoxide compound and the curing agent also has {{a significant impact on the}} curing time. The study has shown that the quality of the machined surface when cutting with ATC is also dependent on processing conditions such as the thickness of the coating layer (0. 8 [...] . 1 mm at least), the surface crispness after preliminary pass of a tool before applying the temporary coating, and the wear rate of a cutting tool. To ensure the economic efficiency of the ATC cutting process and high quality of treatment it is necessary to take into account all abovementioned factors that affect the machined surface. </p...|$|E

Simultaneously acquired Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are available for many of the flight tracks. Since ice thickness measurements are considerably more difficult to accomplish than surface measurements, it is important to improve techniques for estimating thickness from surface characteristics by means of remote sensing. Radar signatures are dependent on ice surface topography and ice volume properties, but ice thickness cannot be measured directly by means of radar. The surface and thickness profiles were analysed in order to improve understanding of the relation between surface roughness and ice thickness.

Numerical simulations based on engineering approaches are in many cases a fast alternative that may supplement actual sound measurements at the site on question. However, the sound propagation models have many assumptions and estimations, as different variants can affect the resulting sound propagation. The accuracy of the sound propagation models Nord 2000, CONCAWE, and ISO 9613 - 2 are investigated in this research by comparing the predicted to the measured sound pressure levels from a wind farm in northern Sweden. Different parameters were investigated in each model, as wind speed and direction, <b>roughness</b> length, ground <b>class,</b> temperature gradient, and receiver height. The computational calculations were run on SoundPLAN software for a single point, the nearby dwelling. For the different parameters investigated, the settings were defined and inputted in the software, and the calculations were run. The equivalent sound pressure level results from the computational models were compared to the equivalent sound pressure level of the sound measurements filtered from background noise.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Biological & Agricultural EngineeringStacy L. HutchinsonSoil erosion is {{a serious}} problem {{resulting}} in degradation of soil systems and nonpoint source (NPS) pollution of water resources. Concentrated overland flow is the primary transport mechanism for many NPS pollutants including soil, and locating areas where sheet flow transitions into concentrated flow is useful for assessing the potential for soil erosion. The ability to predict areas where overland flow transitions to concentrated flow and soil erosion potential is high assists land managers in implementing best management practices (BMPs) to reduce soil erosion and NPS. An erosion model, called the nLS model, was developed to identify transitional overland flow regions. The model is based on the kinematic wave overland flow theory and uses Manning’s n values, flow length, and slope as inputs to determine where overland flow transitions to sheet flow and soil erosion potential increases. Currently, the model has only been tested and validated for watersheds within Kansas. In order to assess model uncertainties and evaluate the model’s applicability to other regions, a sensitivity analysis on key input parameters was conducted. To assess model operations, several sensitivity analyses were performed on model inputs, including digital elevation models (DEMs) and landuse/landcover data (LULC). The impact of slope was assessed using two methods. First, by modifying the DEMs in a stepwise fashion from flatter to steeper terrains, and second, by modifying the elevation of each DEM cell based on the associated elevation error. To assess difficulties that might arise from the parameterization of surface <b>roughness,</b> LULC <b>classes</b> were assigned Manning’s n values within the suggested range using a Monte Carlo simulation. In addition, the critical threshold value used for locating erosion potential sites was modified, and alternative model calculations were used to assess the potential for improving model accuracy. Finally, the model was run using data from multiple sites, including two study areas in Hawaii and two in Kansas. The outputs for each site were analyzed in an attempt to identify any trends caused by site characteristics. Results from this study showed that the nLS model was sensitive to all of the inputs. Modifying the Manning’s roughness coefficient significantly altered the final nLS values and shifted the critical threshold points, especially in areas of the upper watershed. Changes in the slope value modified the nLS model outputs in a predictable manner, but there was some variability, especially in areas with lower slope values. In addition, discrepancies in the DEM, which may be present due to measurement or processing error, were shown to significantly alter the flow paths of a watershed. These findings suggest that accurate roughness coefficients and LULC data are especially important for regions with a steeper topography, and accurate elevation data is important for regions with lower slope values. The results also suggest that the threshold value for the model plays a vital role in locating potential soil erosion sites, and adjustments to this value could possibly be used as a method for calibrating the nLS model. Finally, the alternative model calculations used in this study did not significantly improve the accuracy of the nLS model, so the existing model is sufficient for obtaining accurate nLS estimates. The information gained from this study can improve the assessment of soil erosion processes due to concentrated overland flow. By successfully implementing a land management program that makes use of the nLS models, {{it should be possible to}} improve BMP placement and design, helping to improve water and soil quality...|$|R

In the first part I study how the roughness of the growing layer of the colony depends on the shape of colony-forming cells. To study its impact I develop an off-lattice Eden-like model in which cells are represented as spherocylinders with a variable aspect ratio. I show that the roughness of the expansion front is not significantly affected by the shape of cells and that the dynamic scaling of growing front belongs to the KPZ universality <b>class.</b> <b>Roughness</b> is an important and easy to measure feature which affects the probability of fixation of genetic lineages in the colony. Another feature contributing to the genetic composition of a microbial community is horizontal gene transfer, which is investigated {{in the second part}} of this thesis. I develop an agent-based computational model of bacterial cells which grow, divide, and interact mechanically. I focus on plasmid conjugation, in which donors transfer a plasmid (a small, circular DNA molecule) to plasmid-free recipients. I show that bacteria in the expanding colony segregate into sectors of donors and acceptors. Donor sectors grow at the expense of acceptor sectors and that effect can be effectively described by coalescing random walkers that perform biased random walk on the colony expansion front. I use numerical and analytical methods to show that the plasmid eventually spreads to the whole colony given enough time, and I also show that this time is unrealistically long for experimentally determined conjugation rates and therefore real colonies are expected to have both acceptor and donor sectors. Furthermore, my simulations show that segregative plasmid loss at the moment of cell division can counteract the effect of conjugation and can lead to fixation of plasmid free cells. I also show that changes in nutrient concentration and the resultant change in roughness of the expansion front affect the rate of plasmid spread into population. Quantitative and qualitative results obtained in this section may serve as a tool to extract plasmid invasion rates from experimental data. In the last part of this thesis I investigate how the physical factors, such as finite strength of conjugative junctions, affect the conjugation process. I develop a computational model of plasmid transfer in which conjugative junctions are explicitly modelled as short, spring-like tubes that connect conjugating cells. My results show that factors such as junction creation rate and its strength can significantly affect the conjugation performance. I study different situations corresponding to different experimental scenarios (well-mixed colony on a filter paper, colliding colonies) and show that shear forces acting between cells can significantly lower the rate of plasmid transfer. My results can explain why conjugation occurs very rarely in some of these scenarios investigates in laboratory assays...|$|R

He seems to have moulded and shaped himself to his own whims, till a sort of rough affectation has become thoroughly imbued throughout a kindly nature. He is full of antique prejudices against the modern fashions of the younger officers, their mustaches and such fripperies, and prophesies little better than disgrace in case of another war; owning that the boys would fight for their country, and die for her, but denying that there are any officers now like Hull and Stuart, whose exploits, nevertheless, he greatly depreciated, saying that the Boxer and Enterprise fought the only equal battle which we won during the war; and that, in that action, an officer had proposed to haul down the stars and stripes, and a common sailor threatened to cut him to pieces if he should do so. He spoke of Bainbridge as a sot and a poltroon, who wanted to run from the Macedonian, pretending to take her for a line-of-battle ship; of Commodore Elliot as a liar; but praised Commodore Downes in the highest terms. Percival seems to be the very pattern of old integrity; taking as much care of Uncle Sam's interests as if all the money expended were to come out of his own pocket. This quality was displayed in his resistance to the demand of a new patent capstan for the revenue-cutter, which, however, Scott is resolved in such a sailor-like way to get, that he will probably succeed. Percival spoke to me of how his business in the yard absorbed him, especially the fitting of the Columbus seventy-four, of which ship he discoursed with great enthusiasm. He seems to have no ambition beyond his present duties, perhaps never had any; at any rate, he now passes his life with a sort of gruff contentedness, grumbling and growling, yet in good humor enough. He is conscious of his peculiarities; for when I asked him whether it would be well to make a naval officer Secretary of the Navy, he said, [...] "God forbid, for that an old sailor was always full of prejudices and stubborn whim-whams," [...] instancing himself; whereto I agreed. We went round the Navy Yard with Percival and Commodore Downes, the latter a sailor and a gentleman too, with rather more of the ocean than the drawing-room about him, but courteous, frank, and good-natured. We looked at ropewalks, rigging-lofts, ships in the stocks; and saw the sailors of the station laughing and sporting with great mirth and cheerfulness, which the Commodore said was much increased at sea. We returned to the wharf at Boston in the cutter's boat. Captain Scott, of the cutter, told me a singular story of what occurred during the action between the Constitution and Macedonian--he being powder-monkey aboard the former ship. A cannon-shot came through the ship's side, and a man's head was struck off, probably by a splinter, for it was done without bruising the head or body, as clean as by a razor. Well, the man was walking pretty briskly at the time of the accident; and Scott seriously affirmed that he kept walking onward at the same pace, with two jets of blood gushing from his headless trunk, till, after going about twenty feet without a head, he sunk down at once, with his legs under him.|$|R
