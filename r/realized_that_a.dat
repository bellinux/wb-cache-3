Glass absorbed electromagnetic radiation below 400 millimicrons rather than dispersing it. In the Model B, a quartz prism was substituted for the earlier glass.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} {{afternoon}} hours, forecasters at both the SPC and the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Norman, Oklahoma, <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> major event was likely to take place based solely on observational data from radar and weather satellite imagery and balloon soundings, as the computer models remained uncooperative in helping meteorologists determine where the greatest threat of severe storms would occur.|$|E
5|$|The 1895 {{dispute between}} the United States and Britain over Venezuela was peacefully {{resolved}} through arbitration. Both nations <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> mechanism was desirable to avoid possible future conflicts. American secretary of state Richard Olney in January 1897 negotiated an arbitration treaty with the British diplomat Julian Pauncefote. President William McKinley supported the treaty, as did most opinion leaders, academics, and leading newspapers. The main opposition came from Irish-Americans, who held a very negative view of Britain because of its treatment of Ireland.|$|E

5|$|A paper {{documenting the}} {{discovery}} was {{prepared by the}} team {{and sent to the}} journal Physical Review in March 1941, but publication was delayed until a year after the end of World War II due to security concerns. At the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> slow neutron reactor fuelled with uranium would theoretically produce substantial amounts of plutonium-239 as a by-product. They calculated that element 94 would be fissile, and had the added advantage of being chemically different from uranium, and could easily be separated from it.|$|E
5|$|Allocators {{were invented}} by Alexander Stepanov {{as part of}} the Standard Template Library (STL). They were {{originally}} intended as a means to make the library more flexible and independent of the underlying memory model, allowing programmers to utilize custom pointer and reference types with the library. However, in the process of adopting STL into the C++ standard, the C++ standardization committee <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> complete abstraction of the memory model would incur unacceptable performance penalties. To remedy this, the requirements of allocators were made more restrictive. As a result, the level of customization provided by allocators is more limited than was originally envisioned by Stepanov.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad and the Muslims {{buried the}} {{dead on the}} battlefield, {{returning}} home that evening. The Meccans retired for the evening {{at a place called}} Hamra al-Asad, a few miles away from Medina. The next morning, Muhammad sent out a small force to harass the Meccan army on their way home. According to Watt, this was because Muhammad <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> show of force was required to speed the Meccans away from Medinan territory. The Meccans, not wanting to be perceived as being chased away, remained nearby for a few days before leaving.|$|E

5|$|Russia {{had made}} a {{previous}} attempt to capture Viborg; in October 1706, a siege corps was sent there {{under the command of}} Robert (Roman) Bruce. On 22 October, mortars were placed and the bombardment began, which continued for four days and caused five fires in the fort at Viborg. After the bombardment, Russian forces retreated to Saint Petersburg after commanders <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> siege could not be carried out without naval support and larger cannon. Also, autumn was not considered a suitable time for siege operations. The idea to reattempt a capture of Viborg was first proposed by Peter the Great in 1708, but rejected by the military due to the recent Swedish offensive.|$|E
5|$|That same year, Gygax was {{diagnosed}} with a potentially deadly abdominal aortic aneurysm. Doctors concurred that surgery was needed, but their estimates of success varied from 50% to 90%. With no firm medical consensus, Gygax came to believe that he would likely die on the operating table; he refused to consider surgery, although he <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> rupture of the aneurysm – likely inevitable – would be fatal. In one concession to his condition, he switched from cigarettes, which he had smoked since high school, to cigars.|$|E
5|$|The {{defining}} {{mission of}} the Marine Corps has been to perform an amphibious landing, and they were {{particularly interested in the}} JVX program. They <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> concentrated strike force was vulnerable to a single nuclear weapon, airborne solutions with good speed and range allowed for significant dispersal; and their CH-46s were wearing out; without replacement, the threat of a merger between the Marine Corps and the Army lingered, similar to President Truman's proposal following World War II. The OSD and Navy administration were against the tiltrotor project, but congressional pressure eventually proved persuasive.|$|E

5|$|The story {{depicts a}} young student named Shuichi Nitori, {{described}} by the author as a transgender girl, and Shuichi's friend Yoshino Takatsuki, described as a transgender boy. The series deals with issues such as being transgender, gender identity, {{and the beginning of}} puberty. Shimura was originally going to write the story about a girl in high school {{who wants to be a}} boy, but she <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> boy who wants to be a girl before entering into puberty would have a lot of worries related to growing up, and changed the story to fit this model. Wandering Son was selected as a recommended work by the awards jury of the tenth Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006. The series has been lauded for its use of gender reversal as the core of the story, though the emotional realism of the young characters has been called into question.|$|E

25|$|The Soviet {{government}} <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> military {{solution to}} the conflict would require far more troops. Because of this they discussed troop withdrawals and searched for a political and peaceful solution as early as 1980, but they never took any serious steps in that direction until 1988. Early Soviet military reports confirm the difficulties the Soviet army had while fighting on the mountainous terrain, for which the Soviet army had no training whatsoever. Parallels with the Vietnam War were frequently referred to by Soviet army officers.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, reformers decided that China needed a {{national}} language. The traditional written form, Literary Chinese, {{was replaced with}} written vernacular Chinese, which drew its vocabulary and grammar {{from a range of}} Northern dialects (now known as Mandarin dialects). After unsuccessful attempts to define a cross-dialectal spoken standard, it was <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> single spoken form must be selected. The only realistic candidate was the Beijing-based guānhuà, which was adapted and developed into modern Standard Chinese, which is also often called Mandarin.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} 1980's, {{by the time}} {{fieldwork}} to locate and understand the habitat of the Spix was completed, {{it was apparent that}} the Spix must be nearing extinction in the wild. Conservationists <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> captive breeding program would be necessary to preserve the species. At a meeting in 1987 of conservationist groups including IUCN at Loro Parque (one of the original Spix holders) in Tenerife, Canary Islands (Spain), only 17 captive Spix macaws could be located. Without the attendance of most of the captive Spix holders or involvement of the Brazilian government, little was accomplished.|$|E

25|$|While in college, Hogshead was {{an intern}} at the Women's Sports Foundation.

She served on the board of trustees from 1987 to 1993 and as its President from 1993 to 1994. She is currently the Senior Director of Advocacy for the Women's Sports Foundation. Hogshead <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> person must understand the law in order to be an effective advocate for equity in collegiate sports using Title IX. She applied to and was accepted at Georgetown Law. In 1991 Hogshead was an underwear model in a well-publicized Jockey for Her advertisement.|$|E
25|$|By October 7, Polk's {{forces had}} fallen {{back to the}} town of Perryville. The dry summer of 1862 had left water in short supply, and when the Union troops learned of water in Perryville's Doctor's Creek, they began to move on the Confederate position. Bragg shared Smith's {{assumption}} that the bulk of the Union attack would be directed at Lexington and Frankfort, and ordered Polk's forces to attack and destroy the approaching Union force before proceeding to Versailles to meet Smith. The Confederate soldiers in Perryville, however, <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> much larger force was approaching, and assumed a defensive posture. In fact, Buell, Charles Champion Gilbert, Alexander McCook, and Thomas Crittenden were all approaching Perryville.|$|E
25|$|In 1917 the Brothers of the Christian Schools, who {{had founded}} St. Joseph's College in 1875, opened a junior school on Chatham Road near the Rosary Church. At this time Kowloon was {{expanding}} rapidly. The demand for schools was rising and Brother Aimar Sauron (1873-1945), the Director of St. Joseph's, <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> new school building was necessary. He acquired a large plot near Prince Edward Road {{as a site}} for the new La Salle College in 1928. The site was immediately {{north of the city}} boundary, and thus was technically in New Kowloon. That section of Boundary Street was not yet a formal road when the school site was bought, and was only gazetted in 1929.|$|E
