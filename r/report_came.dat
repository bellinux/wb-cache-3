5|$|The {{detonation}} {{was initially}} planned for 04:00 MWT but was postponed because {{of rain and}} lightning from early that morning. It was feared that the danger from radiation and fallout would be increased by rain, and lightning had the scientists concerned about a premature detonation. A crucial favorable weather <b>report</b> <b>came</b> in at 04:45, and the final twenty-minute countdown began at 05:10, read by Samuel Allison. By 05:30 the rain had gone. There were some communication problems. The shortwave radio frequency for communicating with the B-29s was shared with the Voice of America, and the FM radios shared a frequency with a railroad freight yard in San Antonio, Texas.|$|E
5|$|From 1921 to 1927, Murray led archaeological {{excavations}} on Malta, {{assisted by}} Edith Guest and Gertrude Caton Thompson. She excavated the Bronze Age megalithic monuments of Santa Sofia, Santa Maria tal-Bakkari, Għar Dalam, and Borġ in-Nadur, {{all of which}} were threatened by {{the construction of a new}} aerodrome. In this she was funded by the Percy Sladen Memorial Fund. Her resulting three-volume excavation <b>report</b> <b>came</b> to be seen as an important publication within the field of Maltese archaeology. During the excavations, she had taken an interest in the island's folklore, resulting in the 1932 publication of her book Maltese Folktales, much of which was a translation of earlier stories collected by Father Magri and her friend Liza Galea. In 1932 Murray returned to Malta to aid in the cataloguing of the Bronze Age pottery collection held in Malta Museum, resulting in another publication, Corpus of the Bronze Age Pottery of Malta.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, a {{third major}} {{competitor}} joined {{the race for}} superheavy elements—the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (English: Society for Heavy Ion Research) in Darmstadt, Hesse, West Germany. They claimed to have synthesized the element 107; their <b>report</b> <b>came</b> out {{five years after the}} first report from Dubna did but provided a greater level of precision, making a more solid claim on discovery. The German team joined with the Soviet team in that it suggested the name nielsbohrium for the new element, believing Bohr did deserve an element named after him, and hoping to ease the tension on the element 105 controversy. The Soviet team did not hurry to suggest a new name for element 105, stating it was more important to first determine the discoverers of the element.|$|E

5|$|In early 1989, Schottenheimer {{was fired}} as Browns head coach, {{and took the}} head {{coaching}} job with the Kansas City Chiefs. He still had faith in Junkin, unlike the Browns, and traded a fifth-round pick {{to bring him to}} Kansas City. Two weeks after the trade, a <b>report</b> <b>came</b> out that Junkin had taken steroids provided by a doctor to treat an injured ankle, and had failed a drug test at the scouting combine as a result. Entering the 1989 Kansas City Chiefs season, Junkin competed with Walker Lee Ashley for the second inside linebacker spot alongside Dino Hackett. Ashley won the job, and Junkin played five games before a shoulder injury sidelined him {{for the rest of the}} season. He was released from the Chiefs after season's end, and retired after not being signed by any team through the 1990 season.|$|E

50|$|The medical {{community}} was initially skeptical of MSbP's existence, but it gradually gained acceptance as a recognized condition.

25|$|A UK <b>report</b> <b>came</b> to {{the result}} {{that the effects of}} low-to-moderate alcohol {{consumption}} on mortality are age-dependent. Low-to-moderate alcohol use increases the risk of death for individuals aged 16–34 (due to increased risk of cancers, accidents, liver disease, and other factors), but decreases the risk of death for individuals ages 55+ (due to decreased risk of ischemic heart disease).|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} the Newsday <b>report</b> <b>came</b> out, the Public Safety Committee had not put police {{misconduct}} on the agenda for years. As a result, impunity for misconduct in Nassau County policing is endemic. Instances range from false arrests, through filing falsified reports, planting evidence to excessive force. Some officers have multiple compensation awards made against them at the taxpayers' expense and yet remain on the payroll.|$|E

25|$|One hugely {{influential}} {{source of}} information that has informed the model has been experimental work exploring the extant abilities of visual agnosic patient D.F. The first, and most influential <b>report,</b> <b>came</b> from Goodale and colleagues in 1991 and work is still being published on her two decades later. This {{has been the focus}} of some criticism of the model due to the perceived over-reliance on findings from a single case.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, Weil {{was part}} of an AEC delegation, which also {{included}} Walter Zinn and Charles Wende, that went to Britain as part of the so-called modus vivedi that had replaced the wartime nuclear Special Relationship, between Britain and the United States. They visited Harwell and saw the GLEEP and BEPO reactors. The Zinn-Weil-Wende <b>report</b> <b>came</b> as a shock to the AEC Commissioners, as it indicated that the British were far more technologically advanced than they had thought.|$|E
25|$|On 27 October 1917 Rhys-Davids was {{promoted}} to lieutenant, backdated to 1 September 1917. That same day he took off on a routine patrol and was last seen flying east of Roeselare chasing a group of German Albatros fighters. The Luftstreitkräfte (German Air Service) credited Karl Gallwitz with shooting him down. It was not until 29 December 1917 that a <b>report</b> <b>came</b> through that a German aircraft had dropped a note to inform the RFC of Rhys-Davids's death.|$|E

25|$|Well publicised cases {{illustrate}} the potential role that senior academics in research institutions play in concealing scientific misconduct. A King's College (London) internal investigation showed research findings {{from one of}} their researchers to be 'at best unreliable, {{and in many cases}} spurious' but the college took no action, such as retracting relevant published research or preventing further episodes from occurring. It was only 10 years later, when an entirely separate form of misconduct by the same individual was being investigated by the General Medical Council, that the internal <b>report</b> <b>came</b> to light.|$|E
25|$|In early 2010, Poundland's then-owners Advent International were {{planning}} on {{cashing in on}} the resurgence in discount retailers by preparing to put the chain up for sale.

On Tuesday 4 May 2010, {{it was announced that}} Poundland had been sold to US private equity firm Warburg Pincus for £200 million and was the subject of an Initial Public Offering in March 2014.|$|E
25|$|Cook did {{not lose}} a single man to scurvy, and his <b>report</b> <b>came</b> down in favour of malt and wort, {{although}} {{it is now clear}} that the reason for the health of his crews on this and other voyages was Cook's regime of shipboard cleanliness, enforced by strict discipline, as well as frequent replenishment of fresh food and green stuffs. Another rule implemented by Cook was his prohibition of the consumption of salt fat skimmed from the ship's copper boiling pans, then a common practice in the Navy. In contact with air the copper formed compounds that prevented the absorption of vitamins by the intestines.|$|E

25|$|At 06:20, the Israeli {{artillery}} {{began its}} barrage, and at 07:00, the Israeli tanks (Cromwell and Hotchkiss of the 82nd Battalion) {{set out to}} assist the infantry (Negev Brigade's 7th Battalion), which had already left their bases. At 07:40, the infantry reached the school and a <b>report</b> <b>came</b> in that the village itself was being abandoned. What followed was complete chaos on the Israeli side; a Cromwell tank broke down, a Hotchkiss tank drove into a trap, and others ran out of ammunition. As other tanks broke down, more were needed to take them back for repair. There was no clear communication between the infantry and armored forces, and in different sectors, infantry and armor acted separately.|$|E
25|$|During {{the battle}} the serious {{pressure}} from Ottoman forces advancing to relieve Gaza {{from the east}} had been expected and had begun {{to make an impact}} since 16:00. However, in view of the late start to the battle and the threat from these reinforcements, Dobell, the commander of Eastern Force, after talking with Chetwode, the commander of Desert Column, decided that unless Gaza was captured by nightfall, the fighting must stop and the mounted force withdrawn. By dusk, some of the strong Ottoman Army trenches and redoubts defending Gaza, remained in their control. The British had fired some 304 shells and 150,000 rounds of small arms ammunition, while their infantry casualties were substantial. On the day of battle, 26 March 1917, the sun set at 18:00 (Cairo time). This occurred before Desert Column knew of the capture of Ali Muntar. Therefore, with the approval of Dobell, at 18:10 Chetwode commanding Desert Column, ordered Chauvel to withdraw the mounted force and retire across the Wadi Ghuzzeh. As these orders were being dispatched, a <b>report</b> <b>came</b> in from Dallas that Ali Muntar had been captured, but this information did not change Chetwode's mind. It was not until some time later that he was informed of the capture of the entire ridge. Chetwode's orders were to break off the action after dark and withdraw.|$|E
25|$|Somba Opu {{proved a}} strong fort to be defeated. The attackers {{suffered}} 50 dead and 68 wounded, {{among them were}} several Dutch and native officers. On 22 June, after a 6 days of continuous rain, Arung Palakka decided to led his Bugis, Bacan and Ambon soldiers to enter the breach in the wall. The attack by Arung Palakka was fierce, forcing the Somba Opu warriors to abandon the breach as the Bugis and their allies breached in. Despite the rain, the Bugis managed to set up fire to force the Makassar soldiers to retreat from the eastern and western bastions of the citadel. The Makassar soldiers reestablish their defenses at the southern half of Somba Opu. During the retreat, the Makassar soldiers utilized the largest cannon of Somba Opu, the Anak Mangkasar ("Child of Makassar"), which was heaved {{over the side of}} the northwestern bastion. As the Dutch-Bugis army advanced from the west, a <b>report</b> <b>came</b> mentioning that the Makassar forces had fled and abandoned Somba Opu. Sultan Hasanuddin of the Makassar force had not wanted to leave but the flames, fanned by a strong northwesterly wind, forced him to leave. The only Makassarese within the fort were Karaeng Karunrung who remained in the palace surrounded by his kris-wielding followers. The people inside the mosque had also been driven out, only the Malay wife of Datu Soppeng, and all her children, plus 80 of her retinue remained.|$|E
