25|$|All {{equipment}} must {{be suitable}} for a mixed-gender force. Combat helmets, <b>rucksacks,</b> combat boots, and flak jackets are designed to ensure women have {{the same level of}} protection and comfort as their male colleagues. The women's uniform is similar in design to the men's uniform, but conforms to the female figure, and is functional and practical. Women are also provided with an annual financial entitlement for the purchase of brassiere undergarments.|$|E
25|$|Racks {{under the}} seats {{were used for}} {{ammunition}} and rations; additional racks behind the seat backs held the squad's rifles and other stowage. A small rack for mines was added {{on the outside of}} the hull just above the tracks. In combat, most units found it necessary to stow additional food, <b>rucksacks</b> and other crew stowage {{on the outside of the}} vehicle. Luggage racks were often added in the field, and very late vehicles had rear-mounted racks for this crew stowage.|$|E

25|$|Two bombs—one in Atocha {{and another}} one in El Pozo stations, numbers 11 and 12—were detonated accidentally by the TEDAX. According to the provincial chief of the TEDAX, {{deactivated}} <b>rucksacks</b> contained some other type of explosive. The 13th bomb, which was transferred to a police station, contained dynamite, although it did not explode because it was missing two wires connecting the explosives to the detonator. That bomb used a mobile phone (Mitsubishi Trium) as a timer, requiring a SIM card to activate the alarm and thereby detonate. The analysis of the SIM card allowed the police to arrest an alleged perpetrator. On Saturday, 13 March, when three Moroccans and two Pakistani Muslims were arrested for the attacks, {{it was confirmed that}} the attacks came from an Islamic group. Only one of the five persons (the Moroccan Jamal Zougam) detained that day was finally prosecuted.|$|E
500|$|For {{the landing}} each man carried a {{rucksack}} weighing [...] containing extra ammunition, for the Brens, mortars, Vickers K guns and PIATs. This {{was on top}} of their own personal weapon and ammunition. Unusually each man chose whether to would wear a steel helmet or the Commando green beret. No. 4 Commando were in the second wave and landed behind the initial assault battalion, from the East Yorkshire Regiment, part of the 3rd Infantry Division. Captain Porteous described how their dead and wounded were [...] "just swilling around in the water." [...] Captain McDougal later wrote, [...] "as we were coming ashore the assault troops were committing suicide by trying to dig in on the beach. In passing I kicked the nearest man telling him to keep going. The man was dead. So was the man next to him and a third was seriously wounded by machine gun fire." [...] The Commandos followed their drills and cleared the beach as quickly as possible. Once clear they headed for their assembly area, which was also the commando medical post. Leaving their <b>rucksacks</b> behind, they set off along the Lion sur Mer road towards their objectives.|$|E

2500|$|Some eyewitnesses {{reported}} a [...] "strange smell" [...] {{at the scene}} of some of the attempted attacks and some reported seeing a white powder near the <b>rucksacks</b> containing the suspected bombs.

Police have since confirmed that the devices used by the would-be bombers were entirely conventional explosives.|$|E
2500|$|Both sets of bombings {{involved}} three Underground {{trains and}} a bus; {{in both cases}} <b>rucksacks</b> were involved; and {{in both cases the}} three Underground explosions were roughly simultaneous while the bus explosion was an hour later.

Then he sent a messenger for two or three half-breeds who carried loads for fishing parties. Stevens helped and admitted that Stannard knew his job. All he did was carefully thought about.|$|E

He could not see the face of the first, but noticed her light poise and graceful movements as she sprang from stone to stone. The other followed cautiously and Festing thought she limped, but when the first stopped to wait for her and lifted her head he felt a curious thrill. It was Helen Dalton.|$|E

We should certainly not be free to kill, assault, or threaten anyone we met, and in that we earth-trained men would not be likely to offend. And until we knew more exactly the Utopian idea of property we should be very chary of touching anything that might conceivably be appropriated. If {{it was not the}} property of individuals it might be the property of the State. But beyond that we might have our doubts. Are we right in wearing the strange costumes we do, in choosing the path that pleases us athwart this rock and turf, in coming striding with unfumigated <b>rucksacks</b> and snow-wet hobnails into what is conceivably an extremely neat and orderly world?

40|$|Back pain {{is common}} in {{adolescents}} which {{has been associated with}} carrying a bag. However, there is little research examining the effects of bag style in female adolescents. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the effects of different bag conditions on muscle activity of the trapezius, erector spinae and latissimus dorsi muscles in female university students during walking. Twelve female university students walked on a treadmill for 5 minutes at 1. 1 m/s during five conditions; control, 1 strapped <b>rucksack,</b> 2 strapped <b>rucksack,</b> ipsilateral shoulder strap and contralateral shoulder strap, each containing 10 % bodyweight. Electromyography for the trapezius, erector spinae and latissimus dorsi was recorded for the last 30 s of each condition. Two-way ANOVA and paired t-tests were used to identify differences between right and left muscles and between bag conditions. Results showed that muscle activity of the left trapezius was significantly higher than the right trapezius during the 1 strap <b>rucksack</b> condition. For the left trapezius, the 2 strapped <b>rucksack</b> and the control condition had significantly lower muscle activity compared to the 1 strapped <b>rucksack</b> and the ipsilateral shoulder strap. For the left erector spinae muscle, there was significantly greater muscle activity when wearing the contralateral shoulder strap compared to the control. For the right erector spinae, significantly lower muscle activity was observed when wearing the 2 strapped <b>rucksack</b> compared to the ipsilateral shoulder strap and contralateral shoulder strap. There were no significant differences in muscle activity of the latissimus dorsi muscles between any of the bag conditions. These findings suggest that a two strapped <b>rucksack</b> shoul...|$|R
