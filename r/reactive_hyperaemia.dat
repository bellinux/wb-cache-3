40|$|Blood {{flow through}} aortocoronary venous grafts and its {{response}} to {{a brief period of}} arterial occlusion [...] <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> [...] were studied in relation to the development of postoperative myocardial infarction. In 40 patients with intractable angina due to obstructive coronary artery disease, 72 aortocoronary venous grafts were constructed. In 18 % of the grafts there was no response to the flow to temporary occlusion, due to absence of <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia.</b> In the remaining grafts the flow increased from 17 % to 26 %. In 17 - 5 % of the patients postoperative myocardial infarction was diagnosed. No relation could be established between this control flow through aortocoronary grafts and postoperative myocardial infarction. A significant difference was found in the magnitude of the <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> following occlusion of the graft between patients who developed myocardial infarction (13 - 0 %) {{and those who did not}} (26 - 8 %). Some of our observations suggest that the myocardium is in a state of <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> after coronary surgery.

Twenty-four infants with a gestational age ranging from 25 to 37 weeks and a postnatal age of 0. 3 to 72 days were studied. The <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> response is described by the parameters maximal cutaneous blood flow (Vmax), the time to reach maximal flow (tmax), the time taken for blood flow to return to baseline following Vmax (tend) and the % increase in cutaneous blood flow above preocclusional level (overshoot). A cutaneous <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> response could be elicited in all infants. Following occlusion the Fmax was 2 640 ± 1050 mV (mean ± SD), the tmax was 7. 6 ± 3. 9 sec (mean ± SD), the tend was 35. 6 ± 14. 6 sec (mean ± SD) and the overshoot was 74. 6 ± 34 % (mean ± SD). A negative correlation was found between hematocrit and tmax (r = - 0. 62, p < 0. 01). No influence of postconceptional age, postnatal age, skin and rectal temperature, incubator temperature, weight, and transcutaneous oxygen tension on the <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> parameters could be found. We conclude that <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> of cutaneous blood flow can be elicited in premature newborn infants irrespective of postconceptional age, and that the hematocrit is inversely related to the time to reach maximal flow after occlusion...|$|E

40|$|Objectives:The aim of {{the present}} study was to analyse the effects of various vasodilating stimuli on {{postoperative}} infrainguinal graft haemodynamics. Design:Duplex derived haemodynamic parameters of infrainguinal bypass grafts were measured at rest and after postocclusion <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia,</b> intraarterial papaverine (40 mgm) injection and peroral nifedipine (10 mg) administration. Setting:Department of Surgery, University Hospital. Materials:Twenty-nine patients with infrainguinal bypass grafts were studied by Duplex scanner after a median of 25 months postoperatively. Chief outcome measures:Peak systolic velocity (PSV), mean velocity (MV) and volume flow (VF) were measured at rest and after various stimuli. Main results:VF at rest increased from 125 ± 16 ml/min (mean ± S. E. M.) to 271 ± 26 ml/min after papaverine administration and to 205 ± 19 ml/min during <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> (p < 0. 001). PSV, MV and VF increased significantly during postocclusion <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> and papaverine injection. After nifedipine administration VF increased to 154 ± 21 ml/min after 30 min (p < 0. 001) and there was a significant increase in MV (p < 0. 05).

Design:Prospective open study. Setting:Vascular laboratory of a University Hospital. Materials:Sixty patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease who underwent infrainguinal reconstruction were examined the day before and 1 – 2 days after surgery. Chief outcome measures:The values were obtained during postocclusive <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> induced by release of a 3 min arterial occlusion with a cuff at ankle level with the laser Doppler probe placed dorsally on the first toe. The alterations after surgery in these hyperaemia parameters were compared to changes in ankle/brachial index and clinical improvement at 30 days postoperatively. Main results:Patients improved by surgery according to ankle/brachial index had significantly reduced time to peak (p < 0. 001) and significantly increased resting flux value (p < 0. 05) and peak flux value (p < 0. 05). There was a significant correlation between the change after surgery in time to peak flux and increment of ankle/brachial index (r = 0. 63, p < 0. 001).

40|$|The {{reliability}} and validity of two tests (cold water and <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia)</b> designed to confirm a patient's history of vibration induced white finger were studied. The cold water test is a measure of digital rewarming after hand immersion in cold water. <b>Reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> consists of measuring digital rewarming after cold water immersion plus temporary ischaemia imposed on the hand. For ten weeks, ten healthy male volunteers were submitted once a week to both tests to study their reliability. The results showed a strong inter and intraindividual scattering.

40|$|<b>Reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> is the {{increase}} in blood flow following arterial occlusion. The exact mechanisms mediating this response in skin are not fully understood. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the individual and combined contributions of (1) sensory nerves and large-conductance calcium activated potassium (BKCa) channels, and (2) nitric oxide (NO) and prostanoids to cutaneous <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia.</b> Laser-Doppler flowmetry was used to measure skin blood flow in a total of 18 subjects. Peak blood flow (BF) was defined as the highest blood flow value after release of the pressure cuff. Total hyperaemic response was calculated by taking the area under the curve (AUC) of the hyperaemic response minus baseline. Infusates were perfused through forearm skin using microdialysis in four sites. In the sensory nerve/BKCa protocol: (1) EMLA® cream (EMLA, applied topically to skin surface), (2) tetraethylammonium (TEA), (3) EMLA® + TEA (Combo), and (4) Ringer solution (Control). In the prostanoid/NO protocol: (1) ketorolac (Keto), (2) NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), (3) Keto + l-NAME (Combo), and (4) Ringer solution (Control). CVC was calculated as flux/mean arterial pressure and normalized to maximal flow. Hyperaemic responses in Control (1389 ± 794 %CVCmax s) were significantly greater compared to TEA, EMLA and Combo sites (TEA, 630 ± 512, P = 0. 003; EMLA, 421 ± 216, P < 0. 001; Combo, 201 ± 200, P < 0. 001 %CVCmax s). Furthermore, AUC in Combo (Keto + l-NAME) site was significantly greater than Control (4109 ± 2777 versus 1295 ± 368 %CVCmax s). These data suggest (1) sensory nerves and BKCa channels play major roles in the EDHF component of <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> and appear to work partly independent of each other, and (2) the COX pathway does not appear to have a vasodilatory role in cutaneous <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia...</b>|$|E

Experiments evaluating the BOLD response of muscular tissue during post-occlusive <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> showed a steep increase in the T 2 * signal, followed by a non-linear signal decrease. In patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), the T 2 * signal increase during post-occlusive <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> is a lesser step and delayed.

40|$|The hypothesis, {{based on}} in vitro {{experiments}} on large conduit arteries, that endothelium-derived nitric oxide is a mediator of vascular myogenic reactivity was tested in cat gastrocnemius muscle in vivo. This {{was done by}} comparing, in the absence and presence of effective endothelium-derived nitric oxide blockade by the specific inhibitors NG-monomethyl-L-arginine or NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, myogenic responses in defined consecutive vascular sections to dynamic vascular transmural pressure stimuli, to arterial occlusion (<b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia),</b> and to arterial pressure changes (autoregulation of blood flow and capillary pressure). The results demonstrated that the myogenic vascular reactivity to quick ramp transmural pressure stimuli was not attenuated by endothelium-derived nitric oxide blockade, but rather reinforced. The amplitude of the <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> response was unaffected by endothelium-derived nitric oxide blockade, but its duration was shortened because of faster myogenic constriction, especially of large-bore arterial resistance vessels greater than 25 microns, in the recovery phase. Both the improved myogenic responsiveness to transmural pressure stimuli and the shortening of the <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> by endothelium-derived nitric oxide blockade suggested that endothelium-derived nitric oxide released in vivo acts as a 'metabolic' factor which certainly does not improve, but rather depresses myogenic vascular reactivity. Autoregulation of blood flow and capillary pressure were well preserved {{in the presence of}} endothelium-derived nitric oxide blockade.

40|$|Introduction: Evidence {{exists that}} regular aerobic {{exercise}} benefits vascular health. This beneficial effect is potentially related to repeated {{increases in the}} flow of blood across endothelial cells during exercise. We hypothesised that any exercise effect on endothelial dependent dilation is localised to vascular beds in the exercised limb. An additional objective was {{to determine the effects of}} exercise training on circulating biomarkers of endothelial activation, including soluble adhesion molecules and cellderived microparticles. Methods: Nine overweight, sedentary men (age 34 ± 4 y (mean ± SD) BMI 29. 8 ± 4. 3 kg. m- 2, VO & 2 peak 33. 2 ± 4. 6 ml. min- 1. kg- 1, systolic blood pressure 131. 8 ± 8. 6 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure 82. 6 ± 4. 6 mmHg) participated in the study. All volunteers underwent a two-week exercise intervention, which comprised of two-legged cycleergometry exercise (30 - 45 min at 70 % VO & 2 peak for 5 d of each week) combined with one arm handgrip exercise (one contraction every 2 s at 40 % maximum voluntary contraction for half of each exercise session). Allocation of dominant and nondominant arm to handgrip training or control condition was counterbalanced. The control arm remained perfectly still during exercise. Results: Preliminary work indicated the medium term coefficient of variation for various indices of <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> to be between 10 and 15 %. Peak <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> increased in both the handgrip and control arms following training (p< 0. 05) but the increase in the handgrip-trained arm was considerably greater (48 ± 12 % vs. 16 ± 8 %, p< 0. 05 for interaction). The duration of <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> and the total <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> increased in the handgrip-trained arm (p< 0. 05) but was unchanged in the control arm. With the exception of an increase in soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule, training did not influence soluble adhesion molecules or cell derived microparticle counts.

40|$|Background Spinal {{immobilisation}} using a rigid long spineboard is {{a well-established}} procedure in trauma care. During immobilisation, {{the body is}} exposed to high tissue-interface pressures. This {{may lead to a}} localised inflammatory response of the skin, which may be used to monitor the body's response to different types of immobilisation device. Aim In this study we compared the standard rigid spineboard with a new soft-layered spineboard regarding tissue-interface pressures, skin redness as an indicator of <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> and cutaneous IL 1 α and lactate release. Methods Twelve healthy male participants were asked to lie supine on both a rigid and a soft-layered spineboard, loading the sacrum for one hour, followed by one hour in unloaded position. Tissue-interface pressures on the buttocks during loading were measured continuously using a pressure mapping mat. Cutaneous IL 1 α and lactate concentrations were assessed using Sebutapes, during 20 -minute periods. After each 20 -minute period, a photo of the buttocks was taken, which was later assessed for redness by two observers. Results Significant differences in tissue-interface pressure and <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> were found between the two types of spineboard. Release of IL 1 α and lactate were found to increase with prolonged exposure to pressure, and to decrease in the unloaded prone position. A significant relationship was found between tissue-interface pressure and <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia,</b> but not with IL 1 α nor lactate release. Time course of IL 1 α and lactate release was similar for both types of spineboard. Conclusions IL 1 α and lactate both have a strong relationship with pressure exposure time, but not with pressure magnitude. Furthermore, IL 1 α was measured {{even in the absence of}} visible redness of the skin. The study offers the potention of biomarkers, reflecting inflammation and/or tissue metabolism, for use in assessing the effects of prolonged spineboard support. <br/...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus (DM) and {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) are both associated with endothelial dysfunction and elevated oxidative and inflammatory state. We examined the effect of vitamin C on endothelial function and levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM- 1), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), in DM patients with or without CAD and in non-diabetic subjects. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with DM + CAD, 17 patients with DM without CAD and 21 non-diabetic subjects were divided into groups receiving vitamin C 2 g/day or no anti-oxidant for 4 weeks. Forearm blood flow was determined using venous occlusion gauge-strain plethysmography. Forearm vasodilatory response to reactive hyperemia was considered as index of endothelium-dependent dilation. RESULTS: Baseline levels of IL- 6 and TNF-alpha were significantly higher in patients with DM + CAD compared with patients with DM (P < 0. 01) or non-diabetic subjects (P < 0. 01). IL- 6 and TNF-alpha levels were also higher in DM compared with non-diabetic subjects (P < 0. 05). sVCAM- 1 levels were lower in non-diabetic controls compared with DM + CAD (P < 0. 05) or DM (P < 0. 05). <b>Reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> was higher in non-diabetic controls compared with DM + CAD (P < 0. 001) or DM (P < 0. 001).

40|$|Abstract — The {{analysis}} for the trend of change for diameter of the brachial artery (BA) during baseline (normal relax) condition and flow mediated dilation (FMD) response by using MATLAB software. Data and image (using ultrasonography technique) of BA diameter are taken from three healthy subjects. Results of the analysis reveal that {{after the release of}} blood flow blockage the trend for BA diameter change is rapid increase followed by gradual decrease due to FMD reactive response. The trend of BA diameter change as measured by the sonographer is more variable and the pattern of <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> response is less obvious when compared to the results from MATLAB computation. This shows that computation method (using MATLAB algorithm) produces more smooth BA diameter change and obvious reactive response when compared to the measurement by the sonographer indicating that MATLAB computation produces better accuracy than manual estimation by the sonographer. The main objective to employ and experience the learning process of performing essential image processing has been achieved.

40|$|The need of {{adenosine}} {{administration for}} {{the achievement of}} maximal hyperaemia limits the widespread application of fractional flow reserve (FFR) in the real world. We hypothesised that Pd/Pa ratio registered during submaximal <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> induced by conventional non-ionic radiographic contrast medium (contrast medium induced Pd/Pa ratio: CMR) can be sufficient {{for the assessment of}} physiological severity of stenosis {{in the vast majority of}} cases.

40|$|Arterial and venous {{pressures}} {{have been}} {{measured in the}} cortical circulation of baboons. Arterial perfusion pressure {{was found to be}} relatively lower in hypercapnia than in normocapnia, while venous pressure was higher in hypercapnia than normocapnia. In hypercapnia, during middle cerebral occlusion, the arteriovenous pressure differences virtually disappeared and evidence of collateral inflow to the ischaemic zone was absent. <b>Reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> after middle cerebral occlusion was reduced or abolished in hypercapnia. The significance of these findings in relation to treatment of ischaemic vascular disease with CO 2 is discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective. We {{hypothesize that}} {{treatment}} with Pravastatin, a HMG CoA reductase inhibitor would improve flow-mediated dilation (FMD), a nitric oxide dependent phenomenon and the earliest detectable marker of endothelial dysfunction, in asymptomatic patients with type- 1 diabetes. Materials and methods. FMD of the brachial artery {{in response to}} <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> was measured using high-resolution ultrasonograghy. Young male patients with type- 1 diabetes (n= 9) were compared with age matched non-diabetic controls (n= 8). Results. The FMD response {{in the control group}} was a median increase in diameter of 7. 9 (range 3. 8 – 12. 6) %. In the diabetic group the FMD response was impaired when compared with controls with a median increase only of 4. 4 (range 3. 7 – 5. 8) % (p< 0. 01). Following Pravastatin, 40 mg per day for one month in the diabetic group, there was a significant diameter change in response to <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> with a median of 8. 4 (range 6. 9 – 12. 6) % (p< 0. 01). Conclusions. These data confirm the presence of endothelial dysfunction in young patients with type- 1 diabetes. We have shown that 1 -month of Pravastatin treatment normalizes FMD. This suggests that HMG CoA reductase inhibitors may have a role in the management of diabetes mellitus, even in the presence of normal serum cholesterol levels...|$|E
40|$|Objective Psychosocial {{adversity}} is a {{risk factor}} for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in adults. The authors assessed associations of <b>reactive</b> <b>hyperaemia</b> peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT), a measure of endothelial function predictive of CVD, with self-assessed psychological health among school children. Methods A total of 248 healthy school children (mean (SD) age 14. 0 (1. 0); 136 girls and 112 boys) underwent RH-PAT testing. They completed the Beck Youth Inventories (BYI) of emotional and social impairment scales, which is used to screen for depression, anxiety, anger and disruptive behaviour. Results No sex differences were observed for the RH-PAT score. Statistically signifi cant difference...|$|E
