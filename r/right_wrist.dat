5|$|On July 9, 2008, Jones {{signed a}} {{contract}} with his hometown team, the Miami Heat. He earned $4 million in his first year of a potential five-year contract, worth up to $23.2 million. The first two years were guaranteed, while the final three were options held by both the Heat and Jones. He played in forty games, starting one, for the Heat during the 2008–09 season, averaging 4.2 points, 1.6 rebounds and 15.8 minutes per game. Jones missed 36 games due to <b>right</b> <b>wrist</b> injures and was a DNP-CD six games. He started all seven of the team's playoff games that season. He completed two four-point plays in a span of eleven seconds in a playoff loss to the Atlanta Hawks on April 29, 2009.|$|E

They eventually started dating and married at Grand Hotel Moon Valley in Sorrento, Italy on June 20, 2007. Every year, they used to spend their holidays in Naples, Zincone's native city. The couple had one son, Sebastian Zincone, born on April 16, 2013. On November 25, 2013, the couple announced that they were separating. Zincone filed for divorce on December 2, 2013.|$|E
5|$|On July 8, 2013, Rice {{signed with}} the Washington Wizards. In the 2013 NBA Summer League, he twice {{registered}} the Summer League Sprite Dunk of the Day (July 14 and 19). Rice made his professional debut in the Wizards' seventh {{game of the season}} on November 12, 2013, against the Dallas Mavericks, making his only shot (a three-pointer) and adding a rebound. After Rice's debuted by playing the final 79 seconds of a loss that caused the Wizards to fall to 25, head coach Randy Wittman said he would probably shuffle the lineup. In the following game against San Antonio on November 13, Rice played 13 minutes and tallied 3 rebounds while registering his first NBA steal. On December 9, with Bradley Beal injured and Martell Webster sitting out, Rice who had totaled 11 points in his first 8 games, was given his first NBA start against Denver. Rice scored 7 points to go along with 3 rebounds and 3 steals. On December 18, Rice had an outpatient procedure in New York to repair a fractured <b>right</b> <b>wrist</b> suffered two days earlier. He was expected to miss 36 weeks.|$|E
5|$|Kariya and Selänne joined {{an already}} high-powered Avalanche team that {{included}} such forwards as Joe Sakic, Peter Forsberg, Milan Hejduk and Alex Tanguay. Despite {{high expectations for}} the duo's reunion, Kariya and Selänne both struggled in their sole years with Colorado. After beginning the 2003–04 season on a line with Selänne centred by Joe Sakic, Kariya suffered a sprained <b>right</b> <b>wrist</b> {{in a game against}} the Boston Bruins on October 21, 2003. After being sidelined for ten games, he returned in mid-November, but re-injured his wrist in his first contest back. Due to the injury, Kariya missed playing against the Ducks {{for the first time in}} a home game on November 18. Still recovering a month later, he remained sidelined for a return to Anaheim's Arrowhead Pond on December 20. Kariya's departure from the Ducks drew criticism from his previous team's fans. In anticipation of the Avalanche-Ducks game on December 20, Anaheim fans began a fund that raised over $1,200 to be given to the favourite charity of the Ducks player who scores the game-winning goal against Colorado. The idea was precipitated by reports that Kariya had given Selänne $3,000 for scoring the game-winning goal against the Ducks on November 18 (it is an informal tradition in the NHL for players to offer rewards to teammates who score against former teams). Kariya returned to the Avalanche lineup in time for their next game against the Ducks on January 13, 2004, at the Pepsi Center. He scored one goal in a 3–1 win. Later that month, he played his first game against the Ducks in Anaheim on January 30. Booed every time he touched puck, he recorded two assists, as the Avalanche lost 4–3 in overtime. Limited by injuries, Kariya scored below his career pace with 11 goals and 36 points over 51 games. Selänne recorded 32 points, while playing in 78 games. In the final game of the regular season, Kariya injured his right ankle against the Nashville Predators on April 4. As a team, Colorado lost their division for the first time in nine years to the Vancouver Canucks. Qualifying for the 2004 playoffs as the fourth seed in the West, they lost in the second round to the Sharks. Kariya returned to the Colorado lineup in time for Game 6 against the Sharks, recording an assist as the Avalanche were eliminated by a score of 3–1.|$|E

5|$|Staff Sergeant Leroy A. Petry {{distinguished}} {{himself by}} acts of gallantry and intrepidity {{at the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} in action with an armed enemy in the vicinity of Paktya Province, Afghanistan, on May 26, 2008. As a Weapons Squad Leader with D Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, Staff Sergeant Petry moved to clear the courtyard of a house that potentially contained high-value combatants. While crossing the courtyard, Staff Sergeant Petry and another Ranger were engaged and wounded by automatic weapons fire from enemy fighters. Still under enemy fire, and wounded in both legs, Staff Sergeant Petry led the other Ranger to cover. He then reported the situation and engaged the enemy with a hand grenade, providing suppression as another Ranger moved to his position. The enemy quickly responded by maneuvering closer and throwing grenades. The first grenade explosion knocked his two fellow Rangers to the ground and wounded both with shrapnel. A second grenade then landed only a few feet away from them. Instantly realizing the danger, Staff Sergeant Petry, unhesitatingly and with complete disregard for his safety, deliberately and selflessly moved forward, picked up the grenade, and in an effort to clear the immediate threat, threw the grenade away from his fellow Rangers. As he was releasing the grenade it detonated, amputating his right hand at the wrist and further injuring him with multiple shrapnel wounds. Although picking up and throwing the live grenade grievously wounded Staff Sergeant Petry, his gallant act undeniably saved his fellow Rangers from being severely wounded or killed. Despite the severity of his wounds, Staff Sergeant Petry continued to maintain the presence of mind to place a tourniquet on his <b>right</b> <b>wrist</b> before communicating the situation by radio in order to coordinate support for himself and his fellow wounded Rangers. Staff Sergeant Petry's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service, and reflect great credit upon himself, 75th Ranger Regiment, and the United States Army.|$|E
5|$|On 16 June, United {{embarked}} for Salt Lake City for an 18 June away game at Real Salt Lake. Played at Rio Tinto Stadium, {{the venue}} {{has been considered}} by fans and media alike {{to be one of}} the most hostile environments in MLS and in North American to play in. In franchise history, United had not only failed to win in Rio Tinto, but failed to earn a point in the stadium. In spite of Salt Lake's struggling form, and United's improved form, many still expected Real to defeat United, having the home field advantage and a stronger roster. The 18 June fixture played to a 1–1 tie thanks to penalty kicks from Salt Lake's Fabian Espindola and United's Charlie Davies. The match was marred for its extremely physical, sometimes ruthless play, as well as the lack of discipline imposed by center referee, Terry Vaughn, who only gave one yellow card the entire match. Espindola scored the opening goal in the 38th minute. The penalty was drawn when Salt Lake captain, Kyle Beckerman dribbled within the goal box. As Beckerman dribbled inwards, United's Clyde Simms mistime a slide tackle that missed Beckerman, but resulted in his <b>right</b> <b>wrist</b> deflecting Beckerman's pass into the box. In the second half, United continued to control a majority of the ball position, only to see Chris Pontius's shot deflect off the crossbar in the 53rd minute. Controversy further ignited on what many fans and journalists declared a dive from United's Davies, who drew a penalty kick in the 85th minute, following a breakaway counterattack. The declaration was near universal as video replay and still frames of the incident in the penalty box revealed Davies falling in a diving motion prior to Salt Lake defender, Chris Wingert making any contact with Davies, only to do so once Davies had already fallen down. In spite of this, center official Terry Vaughn whistled it to be a penalty kick. Met with heavy jeers at Rio Tinto, Davies successfully bagged the match tying goal, in spite of the fact that Salt Lake's goalkeeper, a former United player, Nick Rimando, guessed the correct way. In the 92nd minute, during stoppage time, Salt Lake's Jamison Olave recklessly fouled United's Blake Brettschneider to draw a final set piece, possibly to allow United to earn a shocking road win in Salt Lake. However, Najar's free kick was successfully passed to Pontius, whose shot deflected off the crossbar, allowing the match to remain leveled at one apiece. At the match's end heavy boos were ignited by the Salt Lake crowd, primarily directed towards the officiating. The match was deemed as one of the most reckless matches of 2011.|$|E

5000|$|External {{factors such}} as {{temperature}} and humidity affect EDA measurements, {{which can lead to}} inconsistent results. Internal {{factors such as}} medications and hydration can also change EDA measurements, demonstrating inconsistency with the same stimulus level. Also, the classic understanding has treated EDA as if it represented one homogeneous change in arousal across the body, but in fact different locations of its measurement can lead to different responses; for example, the responses on the left and <b>right</b> <b>wrists</b> are driven by different regions of the brain, providing multiple sources of arousal; thus, the EDA measured in different places on the body varies not only with different sweat gland density but also with different underlying sources of arousal [...] Lastly, electrodermal responses are delayed 1-3 seconds. These show the complexity of determining the relationship between EDA and sympathetic activity. The skill of the operator may be a significant factor in the successful application of the tool.|$|R
