5|$|<b>Rockrose</b> {{was named}} after the rock-rose flower. The ship was ordered on 21 September 1939 from Charles Hill & Sons and was laid down on 28 October 1940 at its Bristol shipyard. She was {{launched}} on 26 July 1941 and completed four months later on 4 November. <b>Rockrose</b> was initially assigned to the North Atlantic for convoy escort work, but {{was transferred to the}} South Atlantic in 1942. The ship never engaged the enemy, but rescued survivors from sunken ships on 8, 10 and 29 October of that year. She was later transferred to the Far East and returned home in 1945, after which she was placed in reserve at Devonport Royal Dockyard.|$|E
5|$|Xeromphalina setulipes is {{only known}} from the type {{locality}} {{in the province of}} Ciudad Real, Spain. Members of the Mycenaceae are saprotrophic, and X.setulipes was found in woodland made up of cork oak (Quercus suber) and Portuguese oak (Quercus faginea), with undergrowth consisting of gum <b>rockrose</b> (Cistus ladanifer), prickly juniper (Juniperus oxycedrus), and various heathers (Erica species). The mushrooms were growing in clusters on the forest floor from acid soil, surrounded by dead plant matter. The species's ecological patterns may be useful identifying characteristics, distinct from other, similar species. The mushrooms were found in autumn, and collected in November.|$|E
5|$|Mushrooms {{are mostly}} found during hot spells {{in summer and}} autumn, growing in {{mycorrhizal}} association with various broad-leaved trees and sclerophyllous shrubs, especially oak (Quercus), beech (Fagus), chestnut (Castanea), strawberry trees (Arbutus), treeheath (Erica), and <b>rockrose</b> (Cistus), showing a preference for acid soils. Roadsides and parks are common habitats. The cork oak in particular is an important symbiont, {{and the distribution of}} B.aereus (along with B.mamorensis) aligns with the tree across Europe and North Africa. The ectomycorrhizae that B.aereus forms with sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) and downy oak (Quercus pubescens) have been described in detail. They are characterized by a lack of hyphal clamps, a plectenchymatous mantle (made of parallel-orientated hyphae with little branching or overlap), and rhizomorphs with differentiated hyphae. A 2007 field study on four species of boletes revealed little correlation between the abundance of fruit bodies and presence of its mycelia below ground, even when soil samples were taken from directly beneath the mushroom; the study concluded that the triggers leading to formation of mycorrhizae and production of the fruit bodies appear to be more complex than previously thought.|$|E

50|$|Like {{the rest}} of the eastern Sierra Morena, The {{dominant}} vegetation of Despeñaperros is Mediterranean forest. Holm oak (Quercus ilex) and cork oak (Quercus suber) predominate, along with Portuguese oak (Quercus faginea), Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) and various pines: stone pine (Pinus pinea), Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), and European black pine (Pinus nigra. The predominant shrubs are strawberry trees (Arbutus unedo), heather (genus Erica), <b>rockroses</b> of the genus Cistus, myrtle (genus Myrtus) and kermes oak (Quercus coccifera).|$|R
40|$|Postfire {{regeneration}} in Mediterranean {{pine forests}} is secured through resprouting and reseeding. Obligate reseeders include Mediterranean pines, <b>rockroses</b> (several Cistus spp. {{and other members}} of the Cistaceae) as well as numerous herbaceous plants (mostly legumes). Seeds are safeguarded by the fire heat in either canopy stores (pines) or long-lived soil banks (<b>rockroses</b> and legumes). Induction of seed germination by fire occurs through: i. pine cone opening (and subsequent dispersal) and ii. seed coat "softening " in the hardseeded plants. Hereafter, seeds are more or less ready to germinate and, consequently, seedling recruitment takes place during the early part of the first postfire wet season. Facultative reseeders (usually species with softcoated seeds) are present as well, in addition to "outsiders " (e. g. several composites) that colonise the burned areas through their anemochorous seeds. Seedling recruitment is also observed during the second postfire year, presumably as the result of an abundant first-year reproduction, particularly in geophytes as well as legumes. Pine seed germination and seedling emergence occur massively in a, usually, single "wave", immediately after the onset of the first postfire rainy period (i. e. during November-January). Moreover, the first postfire summer is by far the most crucial period for the survival of these seedlings (and those of other perennial species) ...|$|R
50|$|Mediterranean Conservatory. This large {{greenhouse}} {{displays a}} variety of plants native to coastal areas with hot dry summers and mild rainy winters, such as the Mediterranean, the California coast, southwestern Australia, South Africa and coastal Chile. <b>rockroses,</b> bottlebrush trees, olive trees, myrtles, oleanders and numerous mints and sages are displayed here. This conservatory is also the locale for several flower shows, including Winter Fire Colors, Bulbs in Bloom and the Orchid Show. In 2009, an exhibit on arthropods was added as a preview for a future insectarium to be built at the botanic gardens.|$|R
500|$|Boletus edulis is mycorrhizal—it is in a mutualistic {{relationship}} with the roots of plants (hosts), in which the fungus exchanges nitrogen and other nutrients extracted from the environment for fixed carbon from the host. Other benefits for the plant are evident: {{in the case of}} the Chinese chestnut, the formation of mycorrhizae with B.edulis increases the ability of plant seedlings to resist water stress, and increases leaf succulence, leaf area, and water-holding ability. The fungus forms a sheath of tissue around terminal, nutrient-absorbing root tips, often inducing a high degree of branching in the tips of the host, and penetrating into the root tissue, forming, to some mycologists, the defining feature of ectomycorrhizal relationships, a hartig net. [...] The ectomycorrhizal fungi are then able to exchange nutrients with the plant, effectively expanding the root system of the host plant to the furthest reaches of the symbiont fungi. Compatible hosts may belong to multiple families of vascular plants that are widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere; according to one 1995 estimate, there are at least 30 host plant species distributed over more than 15 genera. Examples of mycorrhizal associates include Chinese red pine, Mexican weeping pine, Scots pine, Norway spruce, Coast Douglas-fir, mountain pine, and Virginia pine. The fungus has also been shown to associate with gum <b>rockrose,</b> a pioneer early stage shrub that is adapted for growth in degraded areas, such as burned forests. These and other <b>rockrose</b> species are ecologically important as fungal reservoirs, maintaining an inoculum of mycorrhizal fungi for trees that appear later in the forest regrowth cycle.|$|E
500|$|<b>Rockrose</b> was {{purchased}} by South Africa in 1947 for conversion into a hydrographic survey ship and was commissioned in the South African Navy on 4 October after a brief refit. Together with the newly purchased minesweepers Rosamund and , she arrived at Cape Town on 24 December. While awaiting for her conversion to begin, the ship was docked at Salisbury Island, Durban. Gilbert Hamer & Co. of Durban finally began work in mid-1949 and she was recommissioned as HMSAS Protea in February 1950. In late 1952, the ship sailed from Port Elizabeth to Marion Island to bring back a patient for an appendectomy and arrived back at Port Elizabeth with only [...] of fuel remaining.|$|E

30|$|A {{practical}} {{consequence is}} that dominance of fire prone species groups, {D, E, F}, in the end, including <b>rockroses,</b> brooms, and small heaths, is expected over sclerophyllous paleomediterranean tall-shrubs (also mesophytic forest shrubs, e.g., {A,B,C}) if fire regime is intense and in short periods. The pine tree, {{which is the}} ecologically dominant plant, seems to align with the fire-sensitive group but with some emergence capacity if seeds are fairly protected by deeper soil layers (i.e., group B). The major ecological issue is that our results suggest that succession in Portuguese pine forests is drawn back to fire-prone pioneer stages by regular fires and kept that way for long periods.|$|R
50|$|Cistus laurifolius, {{commonly}} called laurel-leaf cistus, laurel-leaved cistus or laurel-leaved rock rose, is {{a species of}} highly branched flowering evergreen shrub native to some areas around the Mediterranean. It grows 0.8 - 2 m high. The branches are strong and erect, with reddish bark that is easily removed in strips. The leaves are larger than in the other species of Cistus, up to 9 cm long, lanceolate, dark green, while the underside is whitish due to trichomes. The flowering occurs in late spring (May-June), later than most <b>rockroses.</b> It bears white flowers with a yellow spot in each petal, of 4.5-5 cm diameter It is widely cultivated in gardens, and has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|R
25|$|Mount of El Pardo (Monte de El Pardo) is a {{mediterranean}} forest {{inside the city}} of Madrid. It {{is one of the}} best preserved Mediterranean Forests in Europe.

50|$|La Pedriza:The Pedriza {{is one of}} {{the more}} {{exceptional}} areas of the mountain range. It is located on the south slope of the Cuerda Larga, in the municipal area of Manzanares el Real (part of the province of Madrid) and inside the Parque Regional (Regional Park) de la Cuenca Alta del Manzanares. The Pedriza's landscape is noted for its enormous rock formations and walls of granite displaying unusual and eye-catching configurations. Below the high rocky areas is an underbrush made up of <b>rockroses</b> and savin junipers which become a pine thicket farther way from the rock face. At the heart of the small valleys that make up La Pedriza runs the Manzanares river at the high river basin of its course. In the low part of the area is a recreational area with parking accommodations which allows visitors several routes to cross the territory. The most esteemed and sensational peak of La Pedriza, as well as its largest, is El Yelmo (The Helmet), a gigantic granite rockface towering over the surrounding peaks, rising to 1,700 m in elevation. El Yelmo's south face presents a massive stone wall that is highly prized by advanced mountain climbers. Throughout its history, La Pedriza's complex of caves was used as a hideout by exiles and by those seeking shelter during times of war.|$|R
40|$|Hypothetical low-quality {{habitats}} {{can hold}} an overlooked conservation value. Some frugivorous mam- mals {{such as the}} red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) disperse many viable seeds of fleshy-fruited shrubs along the verges of soft linear developments (SLD), such as trails and firebreaks. However, seed arrival does not guarantee plant recruitment, since several post-dispersal processes can alter seed rain. To examine whether SLD verges assist shrub recruitment and establish- ment, we compared the density {{and the structure of}} a community of Mediterranean shrubs between SLD verges and the adjacent scrubland. Both seedlings and adult fleshy-fruited shrubs dispersed by foxes and rabbits reached higher densities along SLD verges than in the scrubland, suggesting SLD verges can be suitable habitats for shrub recruit- ment and establishment. Bird-dispersed shrubs showed a similar pattern, whereas shrubs dispersed by ungulates and badgers (Meles meles) as well as <b>rockroses</b> (Cistaceae) showed similar densities in both hab- itats. Shrub species composition and diversity were similar between habitats. Due to a marked differential seed arrival, SLD verges housed higher densities of fleshy-fruited shrubs than the adjacent scrubland. Established shrubs may attract seed-dispersing wildlife, and create proper environments for plant recruitment, generating a reforestation feedback. Incipient shrub populations along roadsides may act as stepping stones with potential to connect isolated populations in fragmented landscapes, where SLD are pervasive. We recommend careful management of frugivore populations and SLD verges in order to favor the diversity and the structural complexity of native vegetation while preventing the spread of invasive species.

40|$|Larger corollas {{increase}} the reproductive success of entomophilous plants, {{but are also}} associated with increased carbon and water costs, especially under hot and dry conditions. Minimizing floral carbon and water loss by reducing corolla size should be potentially advantageous for plants living in these environments. We quantify maintenance costs of corollas (water and carbon) in large-flowered <b>rockroses</b> (Cistus spp.) in a Mediterranean ecosystem. We performed field studies of two coflowering sympatric Cistus of contrasting corolla size to analyze water costs. Additionally, we used the larger-flowered species (C. ladanifer) to analyze the effects of intraspecific variation in corolla size on floral net carbon exchange and transpiration rates. We also assessed the mean daily percentage of plant water and carbon consumed by corollas by comparing with that of leaves {{at the time of}} flowering in C. ladanifer. Temperature and corolla area increased water maintenance costs, following an allometric relationship where transpiration rate per unit of area increased with corolla area. Larger flowers tended to heat less under strong irradiance than smaller ones in both species, especially in C. ladanifer, demonstrating a stronger transpirational cooling effect on larger flowers. In terms of carbon, temperature significantly affected net carbon exchange rates, which were not affected by corolla size. Daily water and carbon expenses of corolla were ca. 50 % of those of leaves on an organ surface area basis. Our results suggest that water and carbon maintenance costs of large flowers in the Mediterranean impose significant constraints to corolla size, ecophysiologically favoring smaller-flowered individuals in these ecosystems. © 2014 Geobotanisches Institut ETH, Stiftung Ruebel.
