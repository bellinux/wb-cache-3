5|$|Dynamic braking wastes {{braking energy}} by {{transforming}} it to heat. By contrast, <b>regenerative</b> drives recover braking energy by injecting this {{energy into the}} AC line. The capital cost of <b>regenerative</b> drives is, however, relatively high.|$|E
5|$|Regeneration {{is useful}} in VFDs only where {{the value of the}} {{recovered}} energy is large compared to the extra cost of a <b>regenerative</b> system, and if the system requires frequent braking and starting. <b>Regenerative</b> VFDs are widely used where speed control of overhauling loads is required.|$|E

5|$|<b>Regenerative</b> AC drives {{have the}} {{capacity}} to recover the braking energy of a load moving faster than the designated motor speed (an overhauling load) and return it to the power system.|$|E
5|$|Shawn Roberts as Albert Wesker; the Chairman of the Umbrella Corporation who {{possesses}} superhuman strength, speed, and <b>regenerative</b> capabilities, {{which is}} similar to Alice and also one of her deadliest enemies.|$|E
5|$|The {{vehicles}} {{have three}} braking systems: a primary <b>regenerative</b> dynamic brake, a secondary disc brake and an emergency rail brake. When braking with the <b>regenerative</b> brake, the energy can be fed {{back to the}} overhead wires. The trams are dimensioned to operate an entire day with the dynamic brakes disconnected from one bogie, and for one hour if disconnected from two bogies, in which case only disc brakes will be used.|$|E
5|$|Jason X (2002) marked Kane Hodder's last {{performance}} as Jason. The film starts off in 2010; Jason has returned after another unexplained resurrection. Captured by the U.S. government in 2008, Jason is being experimented upon {{in a research}} facility, {{where it has been}} determined that he has <b>regenerative</b> capabilities and that cryonic suspension is the only possible solution to stop him, since numerous attempts to execute him have proved unsuccessful. Jason escapes, killing all but one of his captors, and slices through the cryo-chamber, spilling cryonics fluid into the room, freezing himself and the only other survivor, Rowan (Lexa Doig). A team of students 445 years later discover Jason's body. On the team's spacecraft, Jason thaws from his cryonic suspension and begins killing the crew. Along the way, he is enhanced by a <b>regenerative</b> nanotechnology process, which gives him an impenetrable metal body. Finally, he is ejected into space and falls to the planet Earth 2, burning in the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Rowling {{has contributed}} money {{and support for}} {{research}} and treatment of multiple sclerosis, from which her mother suffered before her death in 1990. In 2006, Rowling contributed a substantial sum toward {{the creation of a}} new Centre for <b>Regenerative</b> Medicine at Edinburgh University, later named the Anne Rowling <b>Regenerative</b> Neurology Clinic. In 2010 she donated a further £10million to the centre. For reasons unknown, Scotland, Rowling's country of adoption, has the highest rate of multiple sclerosis in the world. In 2003, Rowling took part in a campaign to establish a national standard of care for MS sufferers. In April 2009, she announced that she was withdrawing her support for Multiple Sclerosis Society Scotland, citing her inability to resolve an ongoing feud between the organisation's northern and southern branches that had sapped morale and led to several resignations.|$|E
5|$|Tony Stark {{recalls a}} New Year's Eve party in 1999 where he meets {{scientist}} Maya Hansen, {{the inventor of}} Extremis, an experimental <b>regenerative</b> treatment intended to allow recovery from crippling injuries. Disabled scientist Aldrich Killian offers them a place in his company Advanced Idea Mechanics, but Stark rejects the offer, humiliating Killian.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature that}} {{was ahead of}} its time was the use of dynamic brakes, where some (or most) of the braking effect is created by running the {{traction}} motors in reverse as generators, and then dissipating the generated electrical power in resistors to produce heat. In this case, the heat was generated in the locomotive as opposed to the more typically roof-top open-air coolers seen on most modern locomotives. The resistors were themselves cooled by the water from the steam loop, heating it. This allowed the braking energy to be recuperated, or as it is more typically known, offered <b>regenerative</b> braking.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{regarding}} neuroprotective and specially <b>regenerative</b> treatments, such as {{stem cell}} therapy, while their research is considered of high importance {{at the moment}} they are only a promise of future therapeutic approaches. Likewise, there are not any effective treatments for the progressive variants of the disease. Many of the newest drugs {{as well as those}} under development are probably going to be evaluated as therapies for PPMS or SPMS, and their improved effectiveness when compared with previously existing drugs may eventually lead to a positive result in these groups of patients.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Lexus {{incorporated}} the first production eight-speed automatic transmission {{in an automobile}} with the LS 460, and the gearbox was later adapted for the GS 460 and IS F models. Continuously variable transmissions, <b>regenerative</b> brakes, and electric motors have been used on all Lexus hybrid models. In 2007, Lexus executives signaled intentions to equip further models with hybrid powertrains, catering to demands for a decrease in both carbon pollution and oil reliance. Hybrid models have been differentiated by separate badging and lighting technology; in 2008, the LS 600h L became the first production vehicle to use LED headlamps.|$|E
5|$|PEV is a {{subcategory}} {{of electric}} vehicles that includes battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles, (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional {{internal combustion engine}} vehicles. Even though conventional hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have a battery that is continually recharged with power from {{the internal combustion engine}} and <b>regenerative</b> braking, they can not be recharged from an off-vehicle electric energy source, and therefore, they do not belong to the category of plug-in electric vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Professor Charles Xavier makes {{contact with}} Kitty, meeting {{her at a}} remote Chinese temple with other mutant survivors. Xavier {{explains}} that the Sentinels were designed by Bolivar Trask, who was assassinated by Mystique in 1973. Her DNA being modified by scientists to create and advance the Sentinel program. Kitty, possessing an ability to send a mutant's consciousness back in time, suggests altering history to prevent Trask’s assassination. While Xavier initially plans to be the candidate, Wolverine volunteers instead since his <b>regenerative</b> powers {{would allow him to}} survive the process.|$|E
5|$|While driving, {{after the}} Volt battery {{has dropped to}} a {{predetermined}} threshold from full charge, a small naturally aspirated 1.4 L 4-cylinder gasoline fueled internal combustion engine (Opel's Family 0) with approximately , powers a 55kW generator to extend the Volt's range. The vehicle also has a <b>regenerative</b> braking system. The electrical power from the generator is sent primarily to the electric motor, with the excess going to the batteries, depending {{on the state of}} charge (SOC) of the battery pack and the power demanded at the wheels.|$|E
5|$|Another key design {{decision}} {{was to develop}} the concept car based on a new family of common powertrain components for electric propulsion, which initially was called the E-Flex Systems, “E” stands for electric drive and “Flex” for the different sources of electricity, but later was renamed Voltec drive system. The E-Flex or Voltec powertrain {{is an attempt to}} standardize many components of possible future electrically propelled vehicles, and to allow multiple interchangeable electricity-generating systems. The E-Flex powertrain has the potential to adapt the vehicles to pure battery electric, to fuel cell-powered or to several other sources of energy to create electricity on board, such as engine-generator sets (genset) fueled by gasoline, diesel, biodiesel, ethanol fuel (E100), or flex-fuel (E85). <b>Regenerative</b> braking would also contribute to the on-board electricity generation. In October 2006 the E-flex powertrain was selected for the new propulsion architecture and the name Volt was chosen by General Motors.|$|E
5|$|Cal Poly Pomona {{underwent}} further {{growth in}} the late 20th and early 21st centuries, {{with the construction of}} the CLA Building (soon to be demolished), academic facilities, expansion to the Cal Poly Pomona University Library and the addition of programs such as the Lyle Center for <b>Regenerative</b> Studies, the I-Poly High School and the U.R. Bronco undergraduate research program. Under then-president J. Michael Ortiz, Cal Poly Pomona launched its first comprehensive capital campaign in fall of 2008 to increase its permanent endowment. Nevertheless, the negative economic effects caused by the late-2000s recession has increased student fees, reduced enrollment availability, eliminated two athletic programs and introduced a mandatory furlough calendar for most of its 47,000 employees.|$|E
5|$|Ecosystems are {{regularly}} confronted with natural environmental variations and disturbances {{over time and}} geographic space. A disturbance is any process that removes biomass from a community, such as a fire, flood, drought, or predation. Disturbances occur over vastly different ranges in terms of magnitudes as well as distances and time periods, and are both the cause and product of natural fluctuations in death rates, species assemblages, and biomass densities within an ecological community. These disturbances create places of renewal where new directions emerge from the patchwork of natural experimentation and opportunity. Ecological resilience is a cornerstone theory in ecosystem management. Biodiversity fuels the resilience of ecosystems acting {{as a kind of}} <b>regenerative</b> insurance.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen was {{liquefied}} for {{the first}} time by James Dewar in 1898 by using <b>regenerative</b> cooling and his invention, the vacuum flask. He produced solid hydrogen the next year. Deuterium was discovered in December 1931 by Harold Urey, and tritium was prepared in 1934 by Ernest Rutherford, Mark Oliphant, and Paul Harteck. Heavy water, which consists of deuterium in the place of regular hydrogen, was discovered by Urey's group in 1932. François Isaac de Rivaz built the first de Rivaz engine, an internal combustion engine powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in 1806. Edward Daniel Clarke invented the hydrogen gas blowpipe in 1819. The Döbereiner's lamp and limelight were invented in 1823.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, Ethan Winters, a civilian, {{is drawn}} to a {{derelict}} plantation in Dulvey, Louisiana, by a message from his wife, Mia, who has been presumed dead {{for the past three}} years. While exploring a seemingly abandoned house, Ethan finds Mia imprisoned in the basement. During their escape, Mia suddenly becomes extremely violent and attacks Ethan, forcing him to kill her. After receiving a call from a woman named Zoe offering assistance, Ethan is attacked by a revived Mia, who cuts his left hand off. Jack Baker, the patriarch of the Baker family, captures Ethan; he is dragged to another house and Zoe staples his hand back on. Ethan is held captive by Jack, his wife Marguerite, their son Lucas, and a catatonic, wheelchair-bound elderly woman. After escaping his restraints, he is repeatedly attacked by Jack, who is infected with powerful <b>regenerative</b> abilities.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines are relatively inefficient at converting on-board fuel energy to propulsion {{as most of}} the energy is wasted as heat, and the rest while the engine is idling. Electric motors, on the other hand, are more efficient at converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. Electric drive vehicles do not consume energy while at rest or coasting, and modern plug-in cars can capture and reuse as much as one fifth of the energy normally lost during braking through <b>regenerative</b> braking. Typically, conventional gasoline engines effectively use only 15% of the fuel energy content to move the vehicle or to power accessories, and diesel engines can reach on-board efficiencies of 20%, while electric drive vehicles typically have on-board efficiencies of around 80%.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, fuel {{flows through}} the main fuel valve into <b>regenerative</b> cooling systems for the nozzle and MCC, or through the chamber coolant valve. Fuel passing through the MCC cooling system then passes back through the LPFTP turbine before being routed either to the fuel tank {{pressurization}} system or to the hot gas manifold cooling system (from where it passes into the MCC). Fuel in the nozzle cooling and chamber coolant valve systems is then sent via pre-burners into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited again in the hot gas manifold, from where it passes into the MCC injectors. Once in the injectors, the propellants are mixed and injected into the main combustion chamber where they are ignited. The burning propellant mixture is then ejected through the throat and bell of the engine's nozzle, the pressure of which creates the thrust.|$|E
5|$|The Gangadhara {{image is}} highly damaged, {{particularly}} {{the lower half}} of Shiva seen seated with Parvati, who is shown with four arms, two of which are broken. From the crown, a cup with a triple-headed female figure (with broken arms) to depict the three major rivers in Hindu texts. An alternate interpretation of the three bodied goddess in Gangadharamurti panel here and elsewhere is that it represents the <b>regenerative</b> powers of rivers in the form of Mandakini, Suradhani and Bhagavati. In this grotto scene, Shiva is sculpted and bedecked with ornaments, while gods gather to watch the cosmic source of earthly abundance. The gods and goddesses shown are identifiable from the vahana (vehicle) and icons, and they include Brahma (left), Indra (left), Vishnu (right), Saraswati, Indrani, Lakshmi, and others.|$|E
5|$|The MX3000 {{introduced}} {{a number of}} technical innovations to the metro. <b>Regenerative</b> brakes allow the dynamic brakes to feed the braking energy back to the power system via the third rail. The passengers also have air conditioning. The driver's cabs are more ergonomic than in the older models, and the mirrors to monitor the platforms have been replaced with cameras and screens. The trains' livery is white with gray detailing, instead of the former models' red with blue detailing. For use in areas without a third rail, such as at depots, the trains are equipped with a 110V battery. This will remove the need for shunting at the depots and cut costs.|$|E
5|$|The {{secretions}} {{from the}} parasite give the Nemesis massively heightened <b>regenerative</b> abilities, which {{result in the}} creature being almost impervious to damage; although it can be put down with enough fire from small arms, eventually it will repair itself and resume the pursuit of its targets. However, this resulted in unexpected side effects, including damage to the skin {{and the emergence of}} additional tentacles, as well as unpredictable mutations caused by further attacks. In Resident Evil 3, the creature's survival instincts eventually override Nemesis' programming, causing the host's body to reject the parasite and transform into a giant digestive organ. Featuring large central bone protrusions and elongated tentacles, it crawls looking for prey, yet continues trying to complete its mission despite its now diminished intelligence. This design proved to be the most difficult for the game's development team, as they worked {{to try to make it}} appear as unique as possible.|$|E
5|$|With {{the fuel}} price {{increases}} of the 2000s, the EPA and many companies {{have sought to}} increase diesel truck fuel economy. One such example is the hydraulic hybrid vehicle, which stores energy in hydraulic tanks and hydraulic motors (as opposed to the electric hybrid vehicle which uses batteries and <b>regenerative</b> brakes). Electric hybrid vehicles are another option, with savings of 35 to 60 percent over traditional vehicles. Drivers themselves may improve fuel efficiency by using a method called progressive shifting, in which the driver shifts through the gears (typical trucks may have between 10 and 18 gears) {{in such a manner}} as to optimize the power range of the engine.|$|E
25|$|Haseltine {{went on to}} co-found E-Biomed: the Journal of <b>Regenerative</b> {{medicine}} and of The Society for <b>Regenerative</b> Medicine to help expand this emerging biotechnology. Haseltine authored several articles that laid out the fundamental structure of the new discipline.|$|E
25|$|The <b>regenerative</b> circuit allows an {{electronic}} signal to be amplified many {{times by the}} same vacuum tube or other active component such as a field effect transistor. A <b>regenerative</b> circuit is often an AM detector, converting the RF signal on the antenna to an audio waveform. Their use of positive feedback greatly increases both the selectivity and sensitivity of a simple receiver. Positive feedback builds up the input signal to very high levels. Edwin Armstrong, invented and patented the <b>regenerative</b> circuit {{while he was a}} junior in college, in 1914.|$|E

25|$|Electric {{locomotives}} {{benefit from}} the high efficiency of electric motors, often above 90% (not including the inefficiency of generating the electricity). Additional efficiency can be gained from <b>regenerative</b> braking, which allows kinetic energy to be recovered during braking to put power back on the line.

25|$|The {{ability and}} degree of {{regeneration}} in reptiles differs among the various species, but the most notable and well-studied occurrence is tail-regeneration in lizards. In addition to lizards, regeneration has been observed in the tails and maxillary bone of crocodiles and adult neurogenesis has also been noted. Tail regeneration has never been observed in snakes. Lizards possess the highest <b>regenerative</b> capacity as a group. Following autonomous tail loss, epimorphic regeneration of a new tail proceeds through a blastema-mediated process that results in a functionally and morphologically similar structure. Tail regeneration in lizards presents an interesting case study {{for the evolution of}} <b>regenerative</b> abilities as <b>regenerative</b> ability among the 3,300 extant species varies greatly among them.|$|E
