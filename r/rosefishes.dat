5000|$|Helicolenus dactylopterus (Delaroche, 1809) (Blackbelly <b>rosefish)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} a common bycatch {{associated}} to many demersal fisheries, including the black spot seabream (Pagellus bogaraveo). It is caught by artisanal longline and gillnet fisheries near the Strait of Gibraltar and along the Portuguese continental coast and the Azores.In the western Mediterranean, blackbelly <b>rosefish</b> are mostly caught as bycatch in bottom trawl fisheries targeted at deep-sea crustaceans. However, {{in areas such as}} the Catalan coast, the blackbelly <b>rosefish</b> is the most commercially viable scorpionfish species, with important economic value.|$|R
50|$|D. João de Castro is an {{important}} fishing ground for both demersal fish, such as the black seabream (Spondyliosoma cantharus) and blackbelly <b>rosefish,</b> (Helicolenus dactylopterus), as well as pelagic tuna species (Thunnus and others).|$|R
50|$|As {{with other}} species of scorpionfish, the spines of the blackbelly <b>rosefish</b> contain toxic venom and have {{reportedly}} caused injuries to humans. However, {{there has been little}} research on the venom produced by this species.|$|R
50|$|The blackbelly <b>rosefish,</b> Helicolenus dactylopterus, is {{a marine}} bony {{fish from the}} family Sebastidae, also known as bluemouth rockfish, and bluemouth seaperch. This Atlantic species is a typical sit-and-wait {{predator}} with a highly cryptic coloration.|$|R
50|$|The blackbelly <b>rosefish</b> is {{the most}} {{commercial}} scorpionfish species in the Mediterranean. Although {{there has been little}} commercial interest in this species, partially due to its low level of accessibility, it is currently growing as new resources need to be found by fishing fleets due to the depletion of traditional resources.|$|R
50|$|The blackbelly <b>rosefish</b> is a bathydemersal scorpionfish, {{found in}} soft bottom {{areas of the}} {{continental}} shelf and upper slope. They have been recorded at depths between 50 and 1100 m, but usually from 150 to 600 m. They feed on both benthic and pelagic organisms (decapod crustaceans, fishes, cephalopods and sometimes pyrosomes, polychaetes and echinoderms). The proportions of these prey types in their diet {{vary according to the}} size of the fish.|$|R
5|$|The goblin shark feeds {{mainly on}} teleost fishes such as {{rattails}} and dragonfishes. It also consumes cephalopods and crustaceans, including decapods and isopods. Garbage {{has been recorded}} from the stomachs of some specimens. Its known prey includes bottom-dwelling species such as the blackbelly <b>rosefish</b> (Helicolenus dactylopterus), and midwater species such as the squid Teuthowenia pellucida and the ostracod Macrocypridina castanea rotunda. Thus, the goblin shark appears to forage for food both near the sea floor and far above it.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} gain {{preliminary}} knowledge about the threat to marine ecosystems due to leakage of chemical warfare agents (CWAs) and other pollutants from rusting bombshells on the seabed, a case {{study was conducted in}} a dumping area in the southern Adriatic Sea (depth 200 – 300 m). Following electroacoustic and magnetometric surveys of the CWA dumping area, an integrated ecotoxicological approach was used. This approach was based on analysis of CWA residues and their metabolites, including arsenic, in sediment and organisms, as well as multimarker methodology including the Health Assessment Index, histological lesion analysis and enzyme assays. Two sentinel species were selected, the blackbelly <b>rosefish</b> [Helicolenus dactylopterus (Delaroche, 1809) ] and the European conger (Conger conger L., 1758). Sediment analysis revealed the presence of CWA degradation products, including 1 - 4 -thioxane and 1 - 4 -dithiane. Tissues of fish from the CWA dumping site showed higher levels of arsenic than those from the reference site. Neither CWAs nor their metabolites were detected in fish tissues. Arsenic levels recorded in blackbelly <b>rosefish</b> were well above those reported for other fish species from the southern Adriatic, much higher than the FDA limit for food (2. 6 mg kg 1) and close to the LD 50 calculated for mammals (20 mg kg 1 body weight). The presence of pollutants in the CWA dumping site was also confirmed by pathological lesions in both species and EROD activity, two to three times higher than in fish from the reference site (16. 45 ± 8. 08 and 8. 05 ± 5. 87 pmol min 1 mg protein 1 in blackbelly <b>rosefish</b> and 269 ± 24. 92 and 78. 71 pmol min 1 mg protein 1 in European conger, respectively). Cholinesterase activity seemed unaffected in muscle of both species, whereas in brain they were one-third of those recorded in fish from the reference site (14. 22 ± 10. 05 and 72. 87 nmol min 1 mg protein 1, respectively). This suggests that acetylcholinesterase is sensitive to CWAs. In conclusion, the agreement of all the chemical and biological parameters investigated suggests that the integrated ecotoxicological approach used is appropriate to reveal the presence and biological effects of CWAs in the marine ecosystem...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the environmental threat to benthic species from chemical weapons dumped in the southern Adriatic Sea. An ecotoxicological approach using chemical analysis and biological responses was applied, in two sentinel species: the Blackbelly <b>rosefish</b> Helicolenus dactylopterus and European conger Conger conger. Specimen were collected in a stretch of sea, where had been dumped war materials and from a reference site free of ordnance. Residues of yperite, Hg and As were measured in fish fillets. Skin, liver, kidney and spleen were examined for histopathological and macroscopical lesions. Liver detoxifying capacities (EROD and UDPGT) and genotoxicity (comet assay) were also investigated. As and Hg levels were three-four times higher than those from the reference site in both species (pb 0. 001). Both species captured in dumping site showed clear signs of chronic illness according to the health assessment index (HAI). Deep ulcers and nodules were observed on skin and external organs. Histological lesions such as periportal and bile duct fibrosis, pericholangitis, steatosis, granuloma and elevated splenic MMCs were detected in liver and spleen. Significantly higher EROD activities were also found in both species from dumping site (pb 0. 01). Comet assay revealed genotoxicty in gills of C. conger from dumping site, indicating uptake of chemical warfare agents through fish gills. European conger was found to be a more sensitive bioindicator of this type of contamination than the Blackbelly <b>rosefish...</b>|$|R
50|$|Blackbelly <b>rosefish</b> have intraovarian gestation. Fertilization is internal, as free {{spermatozoa}} {{were found}} primarily in resting ovaries from July through early December with peak occurrence in September through November in the Western Atlantic. There was a delay of 1-3 months before fertilization, as oocyte development {{did not begin}} until December. Occurrence during January through April of early-celled embryos, the most advanced stage observed, and postovulatory follicles indicated that oocyte development was rapid. Has females can store sperm within their ovaries {{that allows them to}} spawn multiple batches of embryos enclosed within a gelatinous matrix secreted into the ovarian cavity. This species has a zygoparous form of oviparity, which occupies an intermediate position between oviparity and viviparity. Larvae and juveniles are pelagic.|$|R
50|$|Blackbelly <b>rosefish</b> is {{a robust}} fish {{with a large}} head with the spination {{described}} for the genus and without tabs or tentacles. The profile of the nape is relatively steeply inclined. It has villiform teeth on both jaws and its large mouth is dark colored inside. The dorsal fin has 11 to 13 spines (usually 12) and 10 to 14 rays (usually 11-13), the anal fin has 3 spines and 5 rays; and the pectoral fin has between 17 and 20 rays. They have 55 to 80 vertical rows of ctenoid scales and their lateral line has tubular scales; The chest, cheek and maxilla are usually scaled but the snout and ventral part of the head are naked. They usually have 25 vertebrae. Gill rakers are well developed: 7 to 9 on the upper arch, 16 to 21 on the lower arch. Their colour is variable, back and sides are red and the belly is pink, with 5 to 6 dark bands below anterior, middle and posterior dorsal spines: below the soft dorsal rays and {{at the base of}} the caudal fin; Y-shaped dark bar between soft dorsal and anal fin; usually a dark blotch on the posterior part of the spinous dorsal fin.|$|R
40|$|Mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), {{and lead}} (Pb) were {{quantified}} in muscle tissue of 5 species of demersal fish (european conger eel, <b>rosefish,</b> brown ray, blackbellied angler, and red mullet) commonly consumed in Italy. In all species studied, Hg {{was the most}} abundant element, followed by Pb and Cd, which exhibited comparable levels. Cd and Pb concentrations did not differ either within individuals {{of the same species}} or among various species examined, whereas Hg accumulation was species-specific. Significant positive correlations between Hg concentrations and fish length for the 5 characterized species were observed. From a public health standpoint, Pb concentrations were under the legal limit for human consumption indicated by European Regulation, whereas Hg and Cd content occurred at levels exceeding the respective critical values in most of the samples examined. The estimated weekly intakes (EWIs) as well as the target hazard quotients (THQs) for Cd and Pb indicated that fish were safe for human consumption, whereas major concern was related to Hg. Fish size-related changes in Hg concentrations determined high THQ and EWI values relatively to larger size fish consumption of these species, except for red mullet, suggesting potential health human risk. A continuous surveillance system of Hg content in fishery products, especially in certain species that for physiological reasons concentrate Hg more easily than others is crucial for consumer health protection...|$|R
40|$|Mercury (Hg) is {{a global}} threat for marine ecosystems, {{especially}} within the Mediterranean Sea. The concern is higher for deep-sea organisms, as the Hg concentration in their tissues is commonly high. To assess the influence of food supply at two trophic levels, total Hg concentrations and carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios were determined in 7 species (4 teleosts, 2 sharks, and 1 crustacean) sampled on {{the upper part of}} the continental slope of the Gulf of Lions (Northwestern Mediterranean Sea), at depths between 284 and 816 m. Mean Hg concentrations ranged from 1. 30 ± 0. 61 to 7. 13 ± 7. 09 μg g− 1 dry mass, with maximum values observed for small-spotted catshark Scyliorhinus canicula. For all species except blue whiting Micromesistius poutassou, Hg concentrations were above the health safety limits for human consumption defined by the European Commission, with a variable proportion of the individuals exceeding limits (from 23 % for the Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus to 82 % for the blackbelly <b>rosefish</b> Helicolenus dactylopterus). Measured concentrations increased with increasing trophic levels. Carbon isotopic ratios measured for these organisms demonstrated that settling phytoplanktonic organic matter is not only the main source fueling trophic webs but also the carrier of Hg to this habitat. Inter- and intraspecific variations of Hg concentrations revealed the importance of feeding patterns in Hg bioaccumulation. In addition, biological parameters, such as growth rate or bathymetric range explain the observed contamination trends...|$|R
40|$|Edible {{marine species}} (fish, {{cephalopod}} molluscs, crustaceans) from the Adriatic Sea were analyzed for content in heavy metals (Hg, Cd and Pb) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Health risks to human via dietary intake of seafood were {{assessed by the}} target hazard quotients (THQs) and the toxic equivalent factors (TEFs). Mercury maximum concentrations corresponded to fish (0. 07 - 1. 56 microg g(- 1) w. w.), followed by cephalopod molluscs (0. 10 - 0. 55 microg g(- 1) w. w.), and crustaceans (0. 27 - 0. 33 microg g(- 1) w. w.). Cadmium levels in cephalopods (0. 18 - 0. 59 microg g(- 1) w. w.) were higher than those in fish (0. 01 - 0. 05 microg g(- 1) w. w.) and crustaceans (0. 02 - 0. 04 microg g(- 1) w. w.), while for Pb the concentrations were generally low (fish: ND- 1. 18 microg g(- 1) w. w., cephalopods: ND- 0. 17 microg g(- 1) w. w., crustaceans: ND- 0. 03 microg g(- 1) w. w.). For PCBs, concentrations in fish, cephalopods and crustaceans ranged between 141 and 3, 406 ng g(- 1) l. w., 190 and 542 ng g(- 1) l. w., and 202 and 429 ng g(- 1) l. w., respectively. Cd and Pb THQ values as well as estimates of PCB TEQ exposure indicated the absence of health risks through consumption of the various seafood. In contrast, mercury TEQs values due to consumption of certain fish species (albacore, <b>rosefish</b> and thornback ray) indicated that human health risk might be of concern...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{shows the}} {{multidisciplinary}} approach {{used to assess}} the eco- toxicity of chemical munitions lying on the seabed in the Southern Adriatic Sea where aerial bombs charged with mustard agent and organoarsenic chemical warfare agents (CWAs) have been dumped. Sampling activities and laboratory analyses have been carried out on two sentinel species, the blackbelly <b>rosefish,</b> Helicolenus dactylopterus, and the European conger, Conger conger, collected in a CWA dumping site 35 nm from the coast of Apulia, Italy, and from a reference site. Fish were analyzed through an ecotoxicological approach, integrating chemical analysis and biological responses. Degradation products of the blister agents bis-(2 -chloroethyl) sulphide, commonly known as mustard agent or yperite (also called sulfur or sulfur mustard) were found in sediment samples collected nearby aerial bombs. Although no evidence of these compounds was detected in tissues of either fish, levels of heavy metals (arsenic and mercury), potentially released by rusted chemical weapons, were significantly higher in sediment and fish from the CWA site compared to the reference site. Severe external and internal lesions were observed in fish captured in the CWA site, with congers displaying small to large skin ulcers along the body. Health assessment index (HAI) values, as well as spleen melano-macrophages centres and CYP 1 A ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity were higher in fish from the CWA site, indicating a chronic state of illness and environment degradation. The working procedures and analyses performed during these surveys could be suitable for future biomonitoring studies in other CWA dumping sites...|$|R
40|$|Dissertação de Mestrado, Estudos Integrados dos Oceanos, 25 de Março de 2013, Universidade dos Açores. Species {{distribution}} modelling of {{the marine}} environment has been extensively used to assess species–environment relationships to predict fish spatial distributions accurately. In this study we explored the application of two distinct modelling techniques, maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) and generalized linear models (GLMs) for predicting the potential distribution in the Azores economic exclusive zone (EEZ) of four economically important demersal fish species: blackbelly <b>rosefish,</b> Helicolenus dactylopterus dactylopterus, forkbeard, Phycis phycis, wreckfish, Polyprion americanus and offshore rockfish, Pontinus kuhlii. Models were constructed based on 13 years of fish presence/absence data derived from bottom longline surveys performed {{in the study area}} combined with high resolution (300 m) topographic and biogeochemical habitat seafloor variables. The most important predictors were depth and slope followed by sediment type, oxygen saturation and salinity, with relative contributions being similar among species. GLMs provided ‘outstanding’ model predictions (AUC> 0. 9) for two of the four fish species while MaxEnt provided ‘excellent’ model predictions (AUC= 0. 8 – 0. 9) for three of four species. The level of agreement between observed and predicted presence/absence sites for both modelling techniques was ‘moderate’ (K= 0. 4 – 0. 6) for three of the four species with P. americanus models presenting the lowest level of agreement (K< 0. 1). For the scope of this study, both modelling approaches presented here were determined to produce viable presence/absence maps which represent a snap–shot of the potential distributions of the investigated species. This information provides a better description of demersal fish spatial ecology and can be of a great deal of interest for future fisheries management and conservation planning...|$|R
40|$|The {{waters of}} the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes are a {{potential}} source of several hundred million pounds of food {{in the form of}} tasty lake and river fishes. This rich resource of the inland waters is important to a nation at war. Because of the growing meat shortage, people will eat more fish than in pre-war years. In the interior of the country, people will eat more fresh-water fish than before, because fish are good and nutritious and because, in the coming months, the shipments of <b>rosefish,</b> halibut, shrimp, and other seafoods that come to them from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf coasts may be curtailed. Among the scores of fishes native to the Mississippi and the Great Lakes are many excellent food fishes, some of them little known even in the States that produce them in greatest quantity. These fishes, if known and properly used, will add variety to wartime meals and health-giving proteins, minerals, and vitamins to the diet.

40|$|Life-history {{information}} {{is extremely important}} in fisheries management, especially details regarding age, fecundity, growth, food habits, and so on. Such knowledge has been lacking for the principal species comprising commercial rockfish catches from California waters. Recent studies have furnished details on annual growth, size and age at maturity, weight-length relationship, season of spawning, fecundity, and feeding habits for 10 species of rockfish (genus Sebastodes) that are commonly taken off California. These are bocaccio, S. paucispinis, chilipepper, S. goodei, yellowtail rockfish, S. flavidus, canary rockfish, S. pinniger, vermilion rockfish, S. miniatus, widow rockfish, S. entomelas, dark-blotched rockfish, S. crameri, splitnose rockfish (<b>rosefish),</b> S. diploproa, stripetail rockfish, S. saxicola, and shortbelly rockfish, S. jordani. Although 57 varieties of scorpaenids (family Scorpaenidae) exist {{off the coast of}} western North America, only two had been studied in any detail prior to this time. Wales (1952) published a partial life history of the blue rockfish, Sebastodes mystinus, and Westrheim (1958), and Alverson and Westrheim (1961) published data on the biology of the Pacific ocean perch, S. alutus. The blue rockfish is a shallow water form, caught mainly by sportfishermen in California. Although poorly represented off California, Pacific ocean perch are abundant in offshore waters of the Pacific Northwest, where they are the primary rockfish sought by otter trawl fishermen. In California waters, the rockfish family is now represented by 50 species of Sebastodes (rockfish or "rock cod"), 2 species of Sebastolobus (channel rockfish), and 1 of Scorpaena (sculpin). This fish family {{is one of the most}} important and colorful in our waters. Most of the species are highly desirable for food and are subjected to both commercial and sportfishing pressure. Only a few are too small to be of direct value for human consumption. Even these are utilized as food by other fishes, often by larger forms of rockfish. Nine of the species in the present study are of considerable commercial value; the tenth, the shortbelly rockfish, is a small form whose greatest value probably is as food for salmon (Merkel, 1957) and similar predators. As time permits and based upon future catch composition evaluations, other prominent species will be studied in similar detail. The most important of these at present seem to be the shortspine channel rockfish, Sebastolobus alascanus, and flag rockfish, Sebastodes rubrivinctus, in northern California; the speckled rockfish, S. ovalis, in central California; and the bronzespotted rockfish, S. gilli and cow rockfish, S. levis, in southern California...|$|R
