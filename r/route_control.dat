50|$|Signalboxes remain {{scattered}} throughout the RailCorp network, with thirty-six still in regular use in 2012, including nine controlled by local station staff, twenty-six by dedicated Signallers and one shared by both. The majority of these were commissioned before 1970, a few {{of which have been}} in continuous use since the late nineteenth century, albeit surviving in a modified state. Eleven are still fitted with Byles-type mechanical lever frames and five have early relay interlocking with Individual Function Switch (IFS) or similar electric switch panels. Newcastle Signalbox, commissioned in 1936 by Mr W.F. Barton, has the last Westinghouse miniature lever power frame in Australia, and one of few remaining in the world. Sixteen signalboxes are fitted with <b>route</b> <b>control</b> relay/solid state interlocking systems and hardwired panels, and three are equipped solely with computerised, VDU-based <b>route</b> <b>control.</b> A few other signalling installations exist outside the RailCorp network, under the control of other rail operators.

50|$|Civilian Air Traffic Controllers' {{licensing}} is standardized {{by international}} agreement through ICAO. Many countries have Air Traffic Control schools, academies or colleges, often {{operated by the}} incumbent provider of air traffic services in that country, but sometimes privately. These institutions are structured to provide training to individuals without any prior air traffic control experience. At the completion of academic training, the graduating student will be granted an Air Traffic Control license, which will include one or more Ratings. These are sub-qualifications denoting the air traffic control discipline or disciplines in which the person has been trained. ICAO defines five such ratings: Area (procedural), Area Radar, Approach (procedural), Approach Radar and Aerodrome. In the United States, controllers may train in several similar specialties: Tower, Ground-Controlled Approach (GCA), Terminal Radar Control, or En <b>route</b> <b>Control</b> (both radar and non-radar). This phase of training takes between 6 months and several years.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Multihoming {{is used by}} stub {{networks}} to improve the reliability of their Internet connectivity. In recent years, commercial “intelligent <b>route</b> <b>control</b> ” devices are used by multihomed stub {{networks to}} optimize the routing of their Internet traffic. In this work, we first conduct measurement of qualities of alternate paths through multihoming. In the remaining part, we study the <b>route</b> <b>control</b> of traffic {{among a group of}} multihomed stub networks which may belong to an organization and exchange data regularly. This type of <b>route</b> <b>control</b> is special because the access links of such networks may not be over-provisioned and are shared by traffic controlled by multiple <b>route</b> <b>control</b> devices. Such shared bottlenecks may affect the effectiveness of uncoordinated “intelligent route control”. We propose a global optimization based approach to coordinate the <b>route</b> <b>control</b> among such a group of networks. Our approach can avoid oscillations which may be caused by uncoordinated <b>route</b> <b>control.</b> Simulation results show that our approach has advantages over equal-splitting based static load-balancing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Multihoming is {{increasingly}} being employed by large enterprises and data centers to extract good performance and reliability from their ISP connections. Multihomed end networks today can employ {{a variety of}} <b>route</b> <b>control</b> products to optimize their Internet access performance and reliability. However, {{little is known about}} the tangible benefits that such products can offer, the mechanisms they employ and their trade-offs. This paper makes two important contributions. First, we present a study of the potential improvements in Internet round-trip times (RTTs) and transfer speeds from employing multihoming <b>route</b> <b>control.</b> Our analysis shows that multihoming to 3 or more ISPs and cleverly scheduling traffic across the ISPs can improve Internet RTTs and throughputs by up to 25 % and 20 %, respectively. However, a careful selection of ISPs is important to realize the performance improvements. Second, focusing on large enterprises, we propose and evaluate a widerange of <b>route</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms and evaluate their design trade-offs. We implement the proposed schemes on a Linuxbased Web proxy and perform a trace-based evaluation of their performance. We show that both passive and active measurementbased techniques are equally effective and could improve the Web response times of enterprise networks by up to 25 % on average, compared to using a single ISP. We also outline several “best common practices ” for the design of <b>route</b> <b>control</b> products. Index Terms—Multihoming, performance, reliability...|$|E
40|$|Today’s Internet {{users and}} {{applications}} are placing increased demands on Internet service providers (ISPs) to deliver fine-grained, flexible <b>route</b> <b>control.</b> To assist network operators in addressing this challenge, we present the Intelligent Route Service Control Point (IRSCP), a <b>route</b> <b>control</b> architecture {{that allows a}} network operator to flexibly control routing between the traffic ingresses and egresses within an ISP’s network, without modifying the ISP’s existing routers. In essence, IRSCP subsumes the control plane of an ISP’s network by replacing the distributed BGP decision process of each router in the network with a more flexible, logically centralized, application-controlled route computation. IRSCP supplements the traditional BGP decision process with an explicitly ranked decision process that allows <b>route</b> <b>control</b> applications to provide a per-destination, per-router explicit ranking of traffic egresses. We describe our implementation of IRSCP {{as well as a}} straightforward set of correctness requirements that prevents routing anomalies. To illustrate the potential of application-controlled route selection, we use our IRSCP prototype to implement a simple form of dynamic customer-traffic load balancing, and demonstrate through emulation that our implementation is scalable. ...|$|E
