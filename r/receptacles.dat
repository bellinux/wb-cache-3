5|$|The Micro plug {{design is}} rated {{for at least}} 10,000 connect-disconnect cycles, {{which is more than}} the Mini plug design. The Micro {{connector}} is also designed to reduce the mechanical wear on the device; instead the easier-to-replace cable is designed to bear the mechanical wear of connection and disconnection. The Universal Serial Bus Micro-USB Cables and Connectors Specification details the mechanical characteristics of Micro-A plugs, Micro-AB <b>receptacles</b> (which accept both Micro-A and Micro-B plugs), and Micro-B plugs and <b>receptacles,</b> along with a standard-A receptacle to Micro-A plug adapter.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} connectors were deliberately {{intended to}} enforce the directed topology of a USB network: type-A <b>receptacles</b> on host devices that supply power and type-B <b>receptacles</b> on target devices that draw power. This prevents users from accidentally connecting two USB power supplies to each other, {{which could lead to}} short circuits and dangerously high currents, circuit failures, or even fire. USB does not support cyclic networks and the standard connectors from incompatible USB devices are themselves incompatible.|$|E
5|$|USB On-The-Go (OTG) {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} a device performing both master and slave roles.

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} the concept, design, analytical modeling and experimental prototype {{for a new}} &quot;smart connector&quot;, which provides electrical and mechanical connection between components of a system, specifically robotic modules. The connector includes plug and <b>receptacle</b> components. The plug has a central pin surrounded by a plurality of lamellae. The lamellae have an end connected to the base and a free end. A Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuator is positioned about the lamellae of the plug for controlling {{the movement of the}} free end of the lamellae. The <b>receptacle</b> has a pin housing corresponding to the central pin of the plug. Additionally, the <b>receptacle</b> includes a plurality of lamellae for mating with the plug lamellae. Like the plug, the <b>receptacle</b> includes an SMA actuator for controlling movement of the <b>receptacle</b> lamellae. The plug lamellae and the <b>receptacle</b> lamellae have corresponding shoulders at the free ends for interconnecting the plug and the <b>receptacle.</b> In another configuration, the plug and <b>receptacle</b> are positioned side by side to provide a universal connector. The connector can transmit axial force through the lamellae, shear force through the <b>receptacle</b> and plug housings, and torque in the case of universal configuration. The disconnection can be controlled from plug and/or <b>receptacle</b> side(s) ...|$|R
5|$|Each morph {{accounts}} for 50% {{of the adult}} males, and they make {{the same number of}} attempts to court females, but using a different courting display. Before looking for a mate, a male spider spins a small, flat web on a surface and ejaculates into it. He then loads the semen into syringe-like <b>receptacles</b> in both palps, and then searches for a female.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{operated}} his family's two {{dairy farms}} and a shop {{with his brother}} Frank {{in the village of}} Woolton. The farms had been in the Smith family for four generations. Smith delivered milk by horse and cart in the Woolton area. The raw milk he provided was stored in a large churn and was ladled out into the bottles and <b>receptacles</b> of customers.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} types of USB connector, {{including}} some that have been added while the specification progressed. The original USB specification detailed standard-A and standard-B plugs and receptacles; the B connector was necessary so that cabling could be plug ended at both ends and still prevent users from connecting one computer receptacle to another. The first engineering change notice to the USB2.0 specification added Mini-B plugs and <b>receptacles.</b>|$|E

40|$|The role of auxin in {{ripening}} strawberry (Fragaria ×ananassa) fruits {{has been}} {{restricted to the}} early stages of development where the growth of the <b>receptacle</b> is dependent on the delivery of auxin from the achenes. At later stages, during enlargement of the <b>receptacle,</b> other hormones have been demonstrated to participate to different degrees, from the general involvement of gibberellins and abscisic acid to the more specific of ethylene. Here we report the involvement of auxin at the late stages of <b>receptacle</b> ripening. The auxin content of the <b>receptacle</b> remains constant during ripening. Analysis of the transcriptome of ripening strawberry fruit revealed the changing expression pattern of the genes of auxin synthesis, perception, signaling and transport along with achene and <b>receptacle</b> development from the green to red stage. Specific members of the corresponding gene families show active transcription in the ripe <b>receptacle.</b> For the synthesis of auxin, two genes encoding tryptophan aminotransferases, FaTAA 1 and FaTAR 2, were expressed in the red <b>receptacle,</b> with FaTAR 2 expression peaking at this stage. Transient silencing of this gene in ripening <b>receptacle</b> was accompanied by a diminished responsiveness to auxin. The auxin activity in the ripening <b>receptacle</b> is supported by the DR 5 -directed expression of a GUS reporter gene in the ripening <b>receptacle</b> of DR 5 -GUS transgenic strawberry plants. Clustering by co-expression of members of the FaAux/IAA and FaARF families identified five members whose transcriptional activity was increased with the onset of <b>receptacle</b> ripening. Among these, FaAux/IAA 11 and FaARF 6 a appeared, by their expression level and fold-change, as the most likely candidates for their involvement in the auxin activity in the ripening <b>receptacle.</b> The association of the corresponding ARF 6 gene in Arabidopsis to cell elongation constitutes a suggestive hypothesis for FaARF 6 a involvement in the same cellular process in the growing and ripening <b>receptacle...</b>|$|R

5|$|Litter {{accumulation}} is {{a perennial}} {{problem in the}} subway system. In the 1970s and 1980s, dirty trains and platforms, as well as graffiti were a serious problem. The situation had improved since then, but the 2010 budget crisis, which caused over 100 of the cleaning staff to lose their jobs, threatened to curtail trash removal from the subway system. Every day, the MTA removes 40 tons of trash from 3,500 trash <b>receptacles.</b>|$|E
5|$|Standard USB has {{a minimum}} rated {{lifetime}} of 1,500 cycles of insertion and removal, the mini-USB receptacle increases this to 5,000 cycles, and the newer Micro-USB and USB-C <b>receptacles</b> are both {{designed for a}} minimum rated lifetime of 10,000 cycles of insertion and removal. To accomplish this, a locking device was added and the leaf-spring was moved from the jack to the plug, so that the most-stressed part is on the cable side of the connection. This change was made so that the connector on the less expensive cable would bear the most wear.|$|E
5|$|While {{the layout}} of {{internal}} genital ducts and openings of the female genitalia depends upon the taxonomic group that insect belongs to, the internal female reproductive system of all lepidopterans consists of paired ovaries and accessory glands which produce the yolks and shells of the eggs. Female insects have a system of <b>receptacles</b> and ducts in which sperm is received, transported and stored. The oviducts of the female join {{together to form a}} common duct (called the 'oviductus communis') which leads to the vagina.|$|E
40|$|Robot {{friendly}} connectors, which, in one aspect, are truss joints {{with two}} parts, a <b>receptacle</b> and a joint, are presented. The joints have a head which is loosely {{inserted into the}} <b>receptacle</b> and is then tightened and aligned. In one aspect, the head is a rounded hammerhead which initially is enclosed in the <b>receptacle</b> with sloppy fit provided by the shape, size, and configuration of surfaces {{on the head and}} on the <b>receptacle...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Replacing the <b>receptacle</b> with a GFCI <b>receptacle</b> is {{the safest}} alternative. If a GFCI <b>receptacle</b> is {{properly}} functioning, it will interrupt dangerous current to limit the duration of a potentially lethal electric shock from an appliance precisely when the <b>receptacle</b> {{is not the only}} conductor to electrical ground (a Ground Fault). For the purpose of protecting humans against electric shocks, the National Electrical Code permits such replacement if the installer marks the GFCI as having [...] "No Equipment Ground".|$|R
50|$|Attempting {{to fully}} insert the longer (17 mm) plug into a <b>receptacle</b> {{designed}} for the shorter (15 mm) plug may damage the <b>receptacle,</b> and may damage any electronics located immediately behind the <b>receptacle.</b> However, partially inserting the plug will work as the tip/ring/ring distances are the same for both variants.|$|R
5|$|Other seeds, such as apple pips and plum stones, have fleshy <b>receptacles</b> {{and smaller}} fruits like hawthorns have seeds {{enclosed}} in edible tissue; animals including mammals and birds eat the fruits and either discard the seeds, or swallow {{them so they}} pass through the gut to be deposited in the animal's droppings {{well away from the}} parent tree. The germination of some seeds is improved when they are processed in this way. Nuts may be gathered by animals such as squirrels that cache any not immediately consumed. Many of these caches are never revisited, the nut-casing softens with rain and frost, and the seed germinates in the spring. Pine cones may similarly be hoarded by red squirrels, and grizzly bears may help to disperse the seed by raiding squirrel caches.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} species of Eucteniza are distinguished by differences in body size, limb proportions, number of tibial spines, and shape of female sperm <b>receptacles,</b> as well as geographic location. Most species are known from male specimens only, but E. rosalia and E. panchovillai are known only from female specimens. Eucteniza species are distributed throughout central and northern Mexico, much of Texas, and {{the lower part of}} the Baja Peninsula. Many species are only known from the type locality, the site where the type specimen or specimens were originally collected. The species with the largest range is E. relata, although Bond and Godwin assert the species is actually composed of multiple as-yet-unnamed cryptic species (distinct species erroneously grouped into one) that will require additional morphological or genetic research to distinguish.|$|E
5|$|The micro {{format is}} the most durable {{from the point of}} view of {{designed}} insertion lifetime. The standard and mini connectors have a design lifetime of 1,500 insertion-removal cycles, the improved Mini-B connectors increased this to 5,000. The micro connectors were designed with frequent charging of portable devices in mind, so have a design life of 10,000 cycles and also place the flexible contacts, which wear out sooner, on the easily replaced cable, while the more durable rigid contacts are located in the <b>receptacles.</b> Likewise, the springy component of the retention mechanism, parts that provide required gripping force, were also moved into plugs on the cable side.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{there are}} three basic formats of USB connectors: the default or {{standard}} format intended for desktop or portable equipment (for example, on USB flash drives), the mini intended for mobile equipment (now deprecated except the Mini-B, which is used on many cameras), and the thinner micro size, for low-profile mobile equipment (most modern mobile phones). Also, there are 5 modes of USB data transfer, in order of increasing bandwidth: Low Speed (from 1.0), Full Speed (from 1.0), High Speed (from 2.0), SuperSpeed (from 3.0), and SuperSpeed+ (from 3.1); modes have differing hardware and cabling requirements. USB devices have some choice of implemented modes, and USB version is not a reliable statement of implemented modes. Modes are identified by their names and icons, and the specifications suggests that plugs and <b>receptacles</b> be colour-coded (SuperSpeed is identified by blue).|$|E
5|$|The {{black bears}} of Yosemite were once famous for {{breaking}} into parked cars to steal food. They were also an encouraged tourist sight {{for many years}} at the park's garbage dumps, where bears congregated to eat park visitors' garbage and tourists gathered to photograph the bears. Increasing encounters between bears and humans and increasing damage to property led to an aggressive campaign to discourage bears from relying on human food or interacting with people and their property. The open-air dumps were closed; all trash <b>receptacles</b> were replaced with bear-proof receptacles; all campgrounds were equipped with bear-proof food lockers so that people would not leave food in their vehicles, which were easy targets for the powerful and resourceful bears. Because bears who show aggression towards people usually are eventually destroyed, park personnel have continued {{to come up with}} innovative ways to have bears associate humans and their property with unpleasant experiences, such as being hit with rubber bullets. Today, about 30 bears a year are captured and ear-tagged and their DNA is sampled so that, when bear damage occurs, rangers can ascertain which bear is causing the problem.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies, or apothecia, of Banksiamyces {{species are}} {{cup-shaped}} <b>receptacles</b> borne on a stipe (stalk), colored dark brown to black {{with a dark}} grey center. When dry, the apothecia are covered with a whitish powder. The edges of the cup may be rolled inwards (especially when dry), or be twisted and somewhat flattened. Both the outermost tissue layer (the ectal excipulum) and the tissue of the stalk are made of fungal cells with brown pigments that can be variously thick- or thin-walled, covered with small particles (granules), and spherical to ellipsoid. The middle tissue layer (the medullary excipulum) of both the cup and the internal tissue layer (the medulla) of the stalk contain a layer of tissue made of hyphae similar to the ectal excipulum. A second layer of tissue is made of hyphae that are translucent and gelatinous; this layer may be present in either the medullary excipulum, the medulla, or both.|$|E
