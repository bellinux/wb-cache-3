Recycling of building waste can make a considerable contribution to reducing the total environmental impact of the building sector.

One object has been to elucidate the environmental effects due to recycling of building waste. The research has been limited to recycling of building materials, its possibilities and its environmental effects. It does not include a reuse of the building itself.

Another object has been to find a method for assessing the <b>recycling</b> <b>potential</b> in buildings and for comparing the <b>recycling</b> <b>potential</b> of buildings with reference to the initial construction.

In this work, a model of stocks and flows for nonmetallic minerals in residential buildings, roads, and railways in the EU 25, from 2004 to 2009 is presented. The changing material composition of the stock is modeled using a typology of 72 residential buildings, four road and two railway types, throughout the EU 25. This allows for estimating the amounts of materials in in-use stocks of residential buildings and transportation networks, as well as input and output flows.

The possible contribution of recycling to conserving resources and relieving the environment has been studied in more detail and described by formulas. Material recycling takes place at different 'energetic levels' of energy consumed in production, depending on whether products, materials or raw materials are involved. The smaller the number of products is which are decomposed into materials and raw materials, the more stored energy of production can be used in new production as savings of energy. The equations needed to calculate the energy equivalence with or without material recycling, with and without incineration and HCl recycling, stretching of resources, stretching of the capacity of landfills, and CO_ 2 reduction have been derived. The status of PVC recycling in practice has been explored during visits to demonstration plants and in talks with representatives of the PVC industry as regards important PVC products in the construction industry (windows, tubes, floor coverings, foils).

Quantitative performance indicators are derived, including (1) degree of system centralization; (2) overall balance; potential of (3) rainfall, (4) stormwater, and (5) wastewater to offset current demand; and (6) water cycle rate. Using the method, we evaluate Sydney, Melbourne, South East Queensland and Perth using reported and modeled data. The approach makes visible large flows of water that have previously been unaccounted and ignored. It also highlights significant intercity variation. In 2004 - 2005, the cities varied 54 % to 100 % in their supply centralization, 257 % to 397 % in the ratio of rainfall and water use, 47 % to 104 % in their potential stormwater <b>recycling</b> <b>potential,</b> and 26 % to 86 % in wastewater <b>recycling</b> <b>potential.</b> The approach provides a practical, water-focused application of the urban metabolism framework.

This paper discusses one of such a simulation model for the aluminium industry at global, regional as well as national levels. Aluminium is the third abundant element in the earth¿s crust and the most abundant metallic element. It never occurs as a free element in nature. Aluminium is a material with wide range of applications, e. g. transport vehicles, construction, packaging industry, electronic production, household appliances, etc., and consequently the economic activities of these industrial sectors determine the overall demand for aluminium. The aluminium model simulates the technology evolution of the industry from 2000 to 2030, exploring the alternative development trends in energy consumption, emissions, technology, retrofitting options and trade. Several future technologies foreseen in the primary aluminium production are considered and projected in the model allowing different scenarios to illustrate the technology dynamics of the sector¿s future. Scrap recycling {{is one of the}} key components of the aluminium industry and is crucial to the sustainable development of the sector. The model, thus, also explores the possible perspective of scrap availability and <b>recycling</b> <b>potentials.</b> Furthermore, based on the demand and supply trend of aluminium, the model also analyses the evolution of bauxite mining and the alumina refining industry. The model is designed to be a flexible tool in accommodating policies to address different environmental issues such as GHG emissions, material use, and waste recycling.
