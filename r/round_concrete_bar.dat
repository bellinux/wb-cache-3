Taking into account the effects of the fiber protective coating, a model is established. Based on the model, the temperature characteristics of fiber-optic PECB sensors are analyzed.

5000|$|It is {{comparable}} to similar structures {{on the island of}} São Miguel, specifically the lighthouses at Ponta Garça and Ponta do Cintrão. The lighthouse consists of a <b>round</b> <b>concrete</b> tower, constructed with ribs, rising from a one-story building.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the station}} was opened in 1999, {{shortage}} of finances left {{it in a very}} depressed state. Exteriorly, bits of the aluminium covering are missing; also, never installed were the glass encasing the pavilions on the staircases. The crude steel and <b>concrete</b> <b>bars</b> that hold the tram wires obstruct the full height of the structure.|$|R

The followmg results were obtained: 1) By the mortar bar method there were confirmed three reactive aggregates. These were all andesites.

50|$|A {{command post}} for the Fortified Position of Liège was {{established}} in the southern portion of the citadel between the warsl, which survives. The <b>rounded</b> <b>concrete</b> forms of the three bunkers contrast with the older masonry.

25|$|While {{timber frame}} and {{cladding}} construction is typical {{for the area}} and period, both the hexagonal form and the weatherboard cladding are unique. The tower is surmounted with a red painted lantern room and an hexagonal gallery. Both towers were easily accessible. The newer tower consisted of concrete posts supported by two vertical <b>concrete</b> <b>bars.</b> The old tower is easily accessible {{to the public as}} was the newer one, but entering is not allowed.|$|R
50|$|The eastern {{section of}} the {{building}} is high-set on timber trusses. The understorey accommodates one classroom and a facebrick ablutions block.

50|$|The three bays of {{the main}} {{entrance}} porch, now glazed to form an enclosed entry vestibule, are punctuated by square columns with <b>rounded</b> <b>concrete</b> brackets. The balcony above the entrance porch has three round arched openings with decorative concrete balustrade panels. The glazing to these openings was a later addition. A gable vent of curved tiles sits below the low pitched gable roof clad with Marseilles tiles.|$|R

50|$|The {{interactive}} CAVE designer {{helps to}} fit a CAVE into a small room. Because of the <b>concrete</b> <b>bars</b> under the ceiling {{it is difficult to}} place it using only 2D plans of the room. Degrees of freedom (blue arrows) are the position and orientation of the projection screen cubicle, the opening angle of the projectors, and the position/orientation of the top mirror. The DOFs are mildly restricted to take only valid values. DOFs are kept consistent, i.e., when moving the cubicles, the projector centers move as well (or get reflected at the walls).|$|R
40|$|One of new {{innovation}} in modified concrete is foamed <b>concrete</b> containing rubber <b>bars.</b> The function of rubber on foamed concrete {{is to improve}} the strength and enhance the resistance toward high strain rate loadings. The production of foamed <b>concrete</b> containing rubber <b>bars,</b> therefore, leads to the heterogeneous material condition or so-called composite. Mostly, the investigations of strength and material properties of modified concrete are conducted using experimental approaches with various parametric and proportions. This study, however, intends to numerically analyse the strength and elastic properties of foamed <b>concrete</b> containing rubber <b>bars</b> through multi-scale simulation. The unit cell consists of foamed <b>concrete</b> and rubber <b>bar</b> was modelled using the hybrid finite-discrete element method. The damage model of rotating crack was defined on foamed <b>concrete,</b> while rubber <b>bar</b> remain as elastic. It was revealed that foamed concrete containing 5 mm diameter of rubber bars with proportion below that 3 % produces optimum strength. Results that obtained from multi-scale simulation show a favourable agreement with that obtained from experimental study and rule of mixtures...|$|R

40|$|A damage–plasticity {{constitutive}} {{model for the}} description of fracture in plain concrete is presented. Two approaches – the local model comprising the adjustment of the softening modulus and the non-local model based on spatial averaging of history variables – are applied {{to the analysis of}} a <b>concrete</b> <b>bar</b> subjected to uniaxial tension and to a three-point bending test. The influence of mesh size and the decomposition into damage and plasticity components are discussed. It is shown that for the two examples studied, both approaches give mesh-independent results. However, the non-local model, which relies on spatial averaging of history variables, exhibits sensitivity with respect to boundary conditions which requires further studies...|$|R
