5000|$|An {{example of}} the {{end-to-end}} principle is that of an arbitrarily reliable file transfer between two end-points in a distributed network of a varying, nontrivial size: [...] The only way two end-points can obtain a completely <b>reliable</b> <b>transfer</b> is by transmitting and acknowledging a checksum for the entire data stream; in such a setting, lesser checksum and acknowledgement (ACK/NACK) protocols are justified only {{for the purpose of}} optimizing performance - they are useful to the vast majority of clients, but are not enough to fulfil the reliability requirement of this particular application. Thorough checksum is hence best done at the end-points, and the network maintains a relatively low level of complexity and reasonable performance for all clients.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- In this paper, a {{new group}} of {{end-to-end}} <b>reliable</b> event <b>transfer</b> schemes is introduced for sensor networks. In these schemes, reliable event delivery is considered rather than reliable delivery of data packets, since the ultimate goal is the detection of events in sensor networks. <b>Reliable</b> event <b>transfer</b> is critical in many applications. Therefore, the need for transferring the events in a reliable way coerced us to introduce {{a new group}} of end-to-end event transfer schemes. In sensor networks end-to-end <b>reliable</b> event <b>transfer</b> schemes can be categorized into two broad classes, as acknowledgement based and non-acknowledgement based. Our new schemes introduced in this paper are in acknowledgement based class. The performance of the proposed schemes is also evaluated for various application areas by simulation...|$|R
50|$|The {{basis of}} the data {{transfer}} control protocol in RINA is the Delta-T protocol. Watson proved that the necessary and sufficient conditions for <b>reliable</b> <b>transfer</b> is to bound three timers. Delta-T {{is an example of}} how this should work. It does not require a connection setup (such as TCP’s SYN handshake) or tear-down (like TCP’s FIN handshake) for integrity purposes. In fact, TCP uses the same three timers! So RINA avoids unnecessary overhead. Watson showed that synchronization and port allocation are distinct functions. Port allocation is part of DIF management, while synchronization is part of the data transfer protocol. In fact, maintaining the distinction also improves the security of connection setup, and avoids the need for separate protocols like IPSec, since multiple transport connections can be associated to the same port allocation.|$|E
5000|$|TCP has {{provided}} the primary means to transfer data reliably across the Internet. However, TCP has imposed limitations on several applications. From RFC 4960: [...] * TCP provides both reliable data transfer and strict order-of-transmission delivery of data. Some applications need <b>reliable</b> <b>transfer</b> without sequence maintenance, while others would be satisfied with partial ordering of the data. In both of these cases, the head-of-line blocking offered by TCP causes unnecessary delay.* The stream-oriented nature of TCP is often an inconvenience. Applications must add their own record marking to delineate their messages, and must make explicit use of the push facility {{to ensure that a}} complete message is transferred in a reasonable time.* The limited scope of TCP sockets complicates the task of providing highly-available data transfer capability using multi-homed hosts.* TCP is relatively vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks, such as SYN attacks. Adoption has been slowed by lack of awareness and lack of implementations, particularly in Microsoft Windows.|$|E
5000|$|Beta mode {{is based}} on 8B/10B (from Gigabit Ethernet, also used for many other protocols). 8B/10B {{encoding}} involves expanding an 8 bit data word into 10 bits, with the extra bits after the 5th and 8th data bits. The partitioned data is sent through a Running Disparity calculator function. The Running Disparity calculator attempts to keep the number of 1s transmitted equal to 0s, thereby assuring a DC-balanced signal. Then, the different partitions are sent through a 5B/6B encoder for the 5 bit partition and a 3B/4B encoder for the 3 bit partition. This gives the packet the ability {{to have at least}} two 1s, ensuring synchronization of the PLL at the receiving end to the correct bit boundaries for <b>reliable</b> <b>transfer.</b> An additional function of the coding scheme is to support the arbitration for bus access and general bus control. This is possible due to the [...] "surplus" [...] symbols afforded by the 8B/10B expansion. (While 8-bit symbols can encode a maximum of 256 values, 10-bit symbols permit the encoding of up to 1024.) Symbols invalid for {{the current state of the}} receiving PHY indicate data errors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Bulk data {{transfers}} in Grids require end-to-end performance guarantees {{as well as}} a <b>reliable</b> {{and efficient}} <b>transfer</b> mechanism. The specific traffic requirements and environment conditions need {{to be taken into account}} as the focus of resource utilization is shifting from power to network resources in data Grids. This article investigates network resource sharing in Grids, especially data Grids. The scheduling of advance resource reservations in Grids was proven to be NP-complete. The existing heuristics for the scheduling of bandwidth requests do not take communication and computation delays and communication overheads into account which are involved in the <b>reliable</b> <b>transfers</b> of such reservations.

Inspired {{by the idea of}} a paperless office and more <b>reliable</b> <b>transfer</b> of data, they developed the first EDI systems. These proprietary systems were fairly efficient, but rigid. Every set of trading partners seemed to have their own method of electronic data interchange. There was no standard that any trading partners could choose to adopt. Recognizing this, the Accredited Standards Committee X12, a standards institution under the umbrella of ANSI, moved to standardize EDI processes. The result is known today as the ANSI X12 EDI standard.This remained the main way to exchange transactional data between trading partners until the 1990s, when companies that offered more robust user interface web applications began to appear. These new web-based applications had functions that catered to both the supplier and customer. They allowed for online submission of individual invoices as well as EDI file uploads, including the CSV, PDF, and XML formats. These services allow suppliers to present invoices to their customers for matching and approval in a web application. Suppliers can also see a history of all the invoices they submitted to their customers without having direct access to the customers' systems. This is because all the transactional information is stored in the data centers of the third-party company that provides the invoicing web app. This transactional information can be regulated by the customer in order to control how much information the vendor is allowed to see.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} multi-hop <b>reliable</b> data <b>transfer</b> for underwater acoustic networks. Due {{to the unique}} features of underwater acoustic channels (such as long propagation delays and high channel error rates), conventional <b>reliable</b> data <b>transfer</b> approaches (such as simple transmission-upon-failure and coding) cannot be directly applied underwater. In addition, the strong property of half-duplex transmission of current acoustic modems requires joint optimization for a multi-hop network scenario {{in order to reduce}} end-to-end delay.

FOCAR is essentially a hybrid ARQ scheme which integrates coding with hop-by-hop retransmission-upon-failure. Fountain codes are used here due to the strong error correction capability and rateless property,which greatly simplifies the selective repeat procedure for reducing end-to-end delay and improving energy efficiency. Further, FOCAR considers the half duplex nature of underwater acoustic modems, adapting the block size of each hop to optimize the endto-end delay for the multi-hop network scenario. Extensive simulation results show that FOCAR can achieve high reliability with low end-to-end delay and high energy efficiency. I...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} <b>reliable</b> data <b>transfer</b> in {{a high-speed}} network (HSN) {{in which the}} per-connection capacity is very large. We focus on sliding window protocols employing selective repeat for <b>reliable</b> data <b>transfer</b> and study two reliability mechanisms based on ARQ and FEC. The question we ask is which mechanism is more suitable for an HSN in which the scalability of <b>reliable</b> data <b>transfer</b> in terms of receiver's buffer requirement and achievable delay and throughput is a concern. To efficiently utilize the large bandwidth available to a connection in an HSN, sliding window protocols require a large transmission window. In this regime of large transmission windows, we show that while both mechanisms achieve the same asymptotic throughput {{in the presence of}} packet losses, their delay and buffer requirements are different. Specifically, an FEC-based mechanism has delay and receiver's buffer requirement that are asymptotically smaller than that of an ARQ-based selective repeat mechanism by a factor of log W, where W is the window size of the selective repeat mechanism. This result is then used to investigate the implications of each reliability mechanism on protocol design in an HSN in terms of throughput, delay, buffer requirement, and control overhead...|$|R
