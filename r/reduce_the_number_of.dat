The statistical population consisted of all spectators in Iran football premier league in 2015 - 16, out of which 395 spectators were randomly selected as the research samples. The data were collected via a researcher-made questionnaire. The first part of the questionnaire included demographic information and the second part, at 6 aspects, includes 35 questions analyzing <b>the</b> reasons for <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> spectators in Iran's football Premier League. For analyzing data, it was used from first and second order confirmatory factor analysis based on structural equations through using SPSS 20 and LISREL 8. 8 software. The results of first order confirmatory factor analysis showed that the measurement model of factors affecting on <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> spectators {{of football}} premier league is an appropriate model and model parameters are significant. All factors are approved as effective variables on <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> spectators of football premier league. The results also showed that the second order measurement model of effective factors on <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> spectators of football premier league are also appropriate, and economic, facilitative, administrative, technical, cultural-social, and personal-family respectively put the most effects on <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> spectators of football premier league.

5|$|Dendritic cells {{bridge the}} {{innate immune system}} and {{adaptive}} immune system. They are increased in psoriatic lesions and induce the proliferation of T cells and type 1 helper T cells (Th1). Targeted immunotherapy as well as psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy can <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> dendritic cells and favors a Th2 cell cytokine secretion pattern over a Th1/Th17 cell cytokine profile. Psoriatic T cells move from the dermis into the epidermis and secrete interferon-γ and interleukin-17. Interleukin-23 is known to induce the production of interleukin-17 and interleukin-22. Interleukin-22 works in combination with interleukin-17 to induce keratinocytes to secrete neutrophil-attracting cytokines.|$|E
