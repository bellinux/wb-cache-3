Schwarz domain decomposition is used to solve the momentum and pressure equations on the composite domain. Convergence of domain decomposition is accelerated by a GMRES Krylov subspace method.

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 Modern {{environmental}} monitoring and modeling requires a good global grid system for survey sampling and accurate, spatially complete data collection of relevant environmental phenomena. A prime {{requirement for the}} global grid system is that the global sampling grids be regular and equal in area and have minimal shape distortion. None of the existing global partitioning approaches meets this or other criteria. The Synder projection is the only method to <b>retain</b> equal-area <b>grids,</b> but the shape distortion is high. After review of the existing approaches to partitioning the earth's surface, we propose a new equal area global partitioning method based upon small circle edges on the earth's surface, which we call the small circle subdivision method. The small circle subdivision method creates the sampling grids which are equal in area and have a much smaller shape distortion {{than those in the}} Synder projection. This method has been proved to be the best so far to achieve the essential criteria for a global grid. In this paper, a detailed implementation of this method, including its mathematical derivation, numerical implementation and analysis of results, are conducted. A comprehensive comparison of the method with other five traditional global partitioning methods are performed...|$|R

The present study deals with stabilizing approaches for a landslide on the road between two towns in Bulgaria. The landslide covers 63 m of the main road connecting the Bulgarian Black Sea capital of Burgas and the border between Bulgaria and Turkey. This road, I- 9, is a first-class road which coincides with European Road E 87 and passes through Bulgarian territory from north to south. In the spring of the year 2010 two parallel cracks appeared in the road near the km 282 + 000 mark and the road sank 2, 5 m. The terrain of the landslide is steep with an inclination of 36 ° - 42 °.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the growth and spread stage of {{full-scale}} fires in enclosures, where a localised flame spreads across a single fuel item, increasing the heat release rate, thereby resulting in increased fire hazard. The development of a numerical model for fire spread over a solid fuel surface, and its integration into a CFD model, is described. The conflicting demands of resolving the small scale flame front phenomena while simultaneously accounting for the large-scale enclosure flow phenomena are addressed. The surface of the fuel is descretised with a regular square array, and flame spread occurs {{as a series of}} ignitions of surface elements. Ignition of an element is determined by a combination of critical surface ignition temperature and cellular automata techniques. Regression of the combusting fuel surface is modelled, with a fine <b>grid</b> <b>retained</b> at the fuel surface by allowing the grid to "collapse " with the surface. A grid transformation is applied to restore orthogonality of the collapsed grid, for simple computation of the heat equation. The flame spread model has been designed to be independent of geometry, although experimental validation exercises are carried out for radial spread over horizontal surfaces only. Predictions are made for the burning of a slab of polyurethane foam in a full-scale multi-room experimental building-fire facility. The predictions compare favourably with the experiments, indicating the broad validity of the methods used in flame spread model...|$|R
