50|$|The {{first known}} mill in Lancashire {{dedicated}} to ring spinning {{was built in}} Milnrow for the New Ladyhouse Cotton Spinning Company (registered 26 April 1877). A cluster of smaller mills developed which between 1884 and 1914 out performed the <b>ring</b> <b>mills</b> of Oldham. After 1926, the Lancashire industry went into sharp decline, the Indian export market was lost, Japan was self-sufficient. Textile firms united to reduce capacity rather than to add to it. It wasn't until the late 1940s that some replacement spindles started to be ordered and ring frames became dominant. Debate still continues in academic papers on whether the Lancashire entrepreneurs made the right purchases decisions in the 1890s. The engine house and steam engine of the Ellenroad Ring Mill are preserved.|$|E

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{a systematic analysis}} {{of the effect of}} common acid sulfate soil (ASS) sample pre-treatments (namely freezing, oven drying, and grinding) on chromium-reducible sulfur (SCR) and water-soluble sulfate determinations. The results show that oven drying and hand grinding of the samples prior to analysis resulted in a decrease in SCR (i. e. up to 20 % compared to those of frozen samples). This lower SCR value was partly due to the oxidation of sulfides in the oven. For oven-dried ASS materials, more intensive grinding in a <b>ring</b> <b>mill</b> increased SCR values, most likely by abrading coatings from pyrite grains. For oven-dried mineral ASS materials the highest SCR values were obtained with 1 min of <b>ring</b> <b>mill</b> grinding, but for soils with appreciable organic matter (such as peat), 5 min of <b>ring</b> <b>mill</b> grinding gave the highest values. The results indicate that for some ASS materials, oven drying, regardless of the ensuing grinding procedure, results in underestimated SCR values. This study also demonstrates that an artifact of oven drying ASS materials can be greatly increased water-soluble sulfate contents...|$|R
50|$|Texas Mill was {{a cotton}} {{spinning}} mill in the Whitelands district of Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, in England. It was built between 1905 and 1907 for the Ashton Syndicate by Sydney Stott of Oldham. It {{was destroyed in}} a massive fire on 22-23 October 1971.

40|$|The work {{presents}} a theoretical and experimental {{assessment of the}} mechanical power absorption by a prototype horizontal <b>ring</b> <b>mill,</b> during the continuous comminution of olivine with feed rates {{for a wide range}} of operating conditions. The forces acting on a ring element of a prototype <b>ring</b> <b>mill</b> under continuous operating conditions have been theoretically calculated and it has been experimentally confirmed that they are proportional to the square of the rotational speed. A linear variation of power with feed rate has been established and a functional relationship between consumed power and rotational speed is also proposed. Results demonstrate that there exists a feed rate for which the value of the friction coefficient between the rings and the powdered material is minimized, independently of the rotational speed. It was further found that the product size depends on the absorbed mechanical power and it decreases with increasing power values. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|Regent Mill, Failsworth is a Grade II listed former cotton {{spinning}} mill in Failsworth, Oldham, Greater Manchester. It {{was built by}} the Regent Mill Ltd. in 1905, but purchased by the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in the 1930s. It was later {{taken over by the}} Courtaulds Group. On ceasing textile production it was occupied by Pifco Ltd, and then by Salton Europe Ltd who now occupy this site. It was driven by an 1800 hp twin tandem compound engine by Buckley & Taylor. It became a <b>ring</b> <b>mill</b> with 60,000 spindles in 1915, all provided by Platt Brothers.|$|R
50|$|Ring {{spinning}} technology {{had successfully}} replaced the spinning mule, with mills having been converted mules to rings. However in the 1970s, the depleted industry was challenged {{by a new}} technology open-end or break spinning. In 1978 Carrington Viyella opened a factory to do open-end spinning in Atherton. This was the first new textile production facility in Lancashire since 1929. Immediately Pear Mill, Stockport and Alder Mill, Leigh were closed. These were both Edwardian mills designed by Stott and Sons.The mill built in 1978 {{was built on the}} Howe Bridge mills site and was named Unit One. It was not an open end mill but a combed cotton <b>ring</b> <b>mill.</b>|$|R

30|$|Bauxite samples crushed to minus 25  mm with {{hammer crusher}} were {{obtained}} from alumina plant and then ground with a Herzog HSM 100 <b>ring</b> <b>mill</b> to under 53  µm fractions. 0.4  g of finely ground and oven-dried powders was put into platinum crucibles with 6  g accurately weighed 33 – 67 lithium metaborate/tetraborate flux. The mixture was fused in Claisse-M 4 Fusion device and the cooled glass discs were analysed on XRF. Red mud and alumina samples {{did not need to}} be crushed or ground due to their fineness. The same method was used to prepare these samples. LOI (100 – 1000  °C) was measured by weight loss of dried samples using a LECO TGA 601.|$|R
50|$|The {{industry}} {{peaked in}} 1912 when it produced 8 billion yards of cloth. The Great War of 1914-1918 halted {{the supply of}} raw cotton, and the British government encouraged its colonies to build mills to spin and weave cotton. The war over, Lancashire never regained its markets. The independent mills were struggling. The Bank of England set up the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1929 to attempt to rationalise and save the industry. Kent Mill, Chadderton was one of 104 mills bought by the LCC, {{and one of the}} 53 mills that survived through to 1950. In 1950, LCC converted it from a mule <b>mill</b> to a <b>ring</b> <b>mill</b> for Egyptian cotton with 104,000 spindles. The mill closed 1991 and was demolished in 1994.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Different {{from the}} {{conventional}} <b>ring</b> rolling <b>mill,</b> the combined <b>ring</b> rolling <b>mill</b> {{has not only}} one main roll and one mandrel to enlarge the ring blank, but also two assistant rolls to deform the ring blank with the main roll continuous feeding. The novel ring rolling process can have three working modes: 1) conventional ring rolling; 2) cross rolling with three rolls surrounding the ring blank; 3) conventional ring rolling with cross rolling. Moreover, the new ring rolling process allows the transferring from one working mode to another. The process and the mill provide more flexibility for manufacturing different ring products. The stiffness condition at different working modes and the smoothly transferring conditions are first studied carefully. Then the combined ring rolling model for deep groove ring is established and evaluated. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{capacity}} of some industrial waste to sequester {{carbon dioxide is}} well known {{and it is also}} noted that to achieve the carbonation reaction it is necessary to activate the precursors overcoming the initial energy barrier through processes of dissolution in an autoclave at high temperature and pressure. To develop the direct carbonation, without autoclaving, our research group uses the mechanical activation of precursor minerals realized through an intense grinding made with friction <b>mill</b> (<b>ring</b> <b>mill).</b> We can estimate the timing of activation of mineral phases using a calculation model realized by us. Knowing the mechanical parameters of the grinding machines, the thermodynamic parameters of the material and the amount of radicalic sites obtained by grinding, we can evaluate the rate of carbonation for each type of mineral. The results show a good correlation between the activation level of the materials and the efficiency of carbon dioxide fixation: at ambient temperature and pressure a yield of up to 98 % can be achieve...|$|R
40|$|The Caron process, which {{involves}} reduction roasting of the ore followed by ammonical leaching of reduced ore, {{has been successfully}} used in processing the iron-rich limonitic part of the nickel laterite ore body.

40|$|The {{identified}} {{emissions of}} abiogenic carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and methane are generally attributed to volcanic activity or to geochemical processes associated with thermometamorphic effects. In this paper we show another possible abiogenic source of emission, induced by mechanical, and not thermal, stresses. We investigated the mechanochemical production {{of carbon dioxide}} and methane when friction is applied to marly-type rock and studied the mechanisms determining the strong CO 2 and CH 4 emissions observed. A <b>ring</b> <b>mill</b> was used to apply friction and oriented pressure upon a synthetic calcite-clay mixture of varying proportions. We found that the CO 2 and CH 4 release versus the grinding action has a non-linear trend reflecting the behaviour of decreasing crystallinity, which indicates a close link between crystallinity and gas production. For the CO 2 emission, we propose a release mechanism connected with the friction-induced fractures and the increase in structural disorders induced by creep in the lattice. The CH 4 emission could be explained by a Sabatier reaction in which CO 2 and hydrogen are involved to form CH 4 and water...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{reports on}} {{optimization}} of natural zeolite as filler in polypropylene com-posite. Effects of zeolite loading and surface treatment were performed in this work. Prior to mixing process, zeolite was ground by <b>ring</b> <b>mill</b> into a powder form. The composites were prepared using Thermo Haake Polydrive internal mixer and then compression molded according to standard test specimen. Tensile and impact tests {{were performed to}} characterize the mechanical properties of untreated and treated composites. The obtained experimental values of Young’s modulus were then related to the theoretical predictions using a HalpinTsai equation. The theoretical prediction resulted in greater values of tensile modulus compared to the experimental values. A morphological study was done on the tensile fractured surface using a scanning electron microscopy. A Fourier transform infrared spectra analysis {{was performed on the}} composites to study the interaction between the polypropylene and functional group of stearic acid and vinyl silane. It was found that the tensile strength, elongation at break, and impact strength decreased but the Young’s mod-ulus increased with increasing zeolite content. The addition of coupling agents was proved to enhance the mechanical properties of zeolite/polypropylene composite. However, stearic acid has little effect in improving the composite mechanical properties in comparison with vinyl silane.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{application}} of mechanochemistry to model systems composed of alumina or silica artificially contaminated with n-C 16 H 34. The mechanochemical treatment {{was carried out by}} means of a <b>ring</b> <b>mill</b> for times ranging from 10 to 40 h. Thermogravimetry and infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies were used for the characterization of the mechanochemical products. The results have indicated that, in the case of alumina, almost all the contaminant n-C 16 H 34 undergoes a complex oxidative reaction path whose end products are strongly held on the surface. These end products are most likely made of crosslinked, partially oxidized hydrocarbon chains bond to the solid surface via COO− groups. In the case of silica, the hydrocarbon undergoes a different, equally complex reaction path, but to a lower extent. In this case the end products are most probably carbonylic compounds and graphitic carbon. Then, for both solid matrices, the mechanochemical treatment promotes significant modification of the chemical nature of the polluting hydrocarbon with end products much more difficult to remove from the surface. As the systems studied are models of sites contaminated by aliphatic hydrocarbon, the results are worthy of consideration in relation to the mobility of the contaminants in the environment...|$|R

We study the stability and instability of flock <b>ring</b> and <b>mill</b> <b>ring</b> solutions of second order swarming models, determining the stable regions of parameters and obtaining a spectral equivalence between first order and second order model in the case of flock solutions. In the second part we embed classical swarming models with control dynamics. We first present a general framework for swarming model interacting with few individuals, seen as external point source forces, giving a microscopic, a mesoscopic and a macroscopic description. Later we focus on optimal control problems for self-organized systems and inspired by model predictive control strategy, we obtain a kinetic description of the initial optimal control problem. In the end we report an asymptotic preserving scheme or optimal control problems of boundary problems governed by the hyperbolic relaxed systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{remediation}} {{of industrial}} buildings covered with asbestos-cement roofs {{is one of}} the most important issues in asbestos risk management. The relevant Italian Directives call for the above waste to be treated prior to disposal on landfill. Processes able to eliminate the hazard of these wastes are very attractive because the treated products can be recycled as mineral components in building materials. In this work, asbestos-cement waste is milled by means of a high energy <b>ring</b> <b>mill</b> for up to 4 h. The very fine powders obtained at all milling times are characterized to check the mineralogical and morphological transformation of the asbestos phases. Specifically, after 120 min of milling, the disappearance of the chrysotile OH stretching modes at 3690 cm− 1, of the main crystalline chrysotile peaks and of the fibrous phase are detected by means of infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy analyses, respectively. The hydraulic behavior of the milled powders in presence of lime is also tested at different times. The results of thermal analyses show that the endothermic effects associated to the neoformed binding phases significantly increase with curing time. Furthermore, the technological efficacy of the recycling process is evaluated by preparing and testing hydraulic lime and milled powder-based mortars. The complete test set gives good results in terms of the hydration kinetics and mechanical properties of the building materials studied. In fact, values of reacted lime around 40...|$|R
