500|$|Four {{centuries of}} {{non-indigenous}} rule {{can be viewed}} through several changing periods of governing power and shifting official policy toward aborigines. From the 17th century until the early 20th, {{the impact of the}} foreign settlers—the Dutch, Spanish and Han—was more extensive on the Plains peoples. The latter were far more geographically accessible, and thus had more dealings with the foreign powers. By the beginning of the 20th century, the Plains peoples had largely been assimilated into contemporary Taiwanese culture as a result of European and Han colonial rule. Until {{the latter half of the}} Japanese colonial era the Mountain peoples were not entirely governed by any non-indigenous polity. However, the mid-1930s marked a shift in the intercultural dynamic, as the Japanese began to play a far more dominant role in the culture of the Highland groups. This increased degree of control over the Mountain peoples continued during Kuomintang rule. Within these two broad eras, there were many differences in the individual and <b>regional</b> <b>impact</b> of the colonizers and their [...] "civilizing projects". At times the foreign powers were accepted readily, as some communities adopted foreign clothing styles and cultural practices , and engaged in cooperative trade in goods such as camphor, deer hides, sugar, tea and rice. At numerous other times changes from the outside world were forcibly imposed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-This paper {{analyzes}} the <b>regional</b> <b>impacts</b> of changing {{a major component}} of national farm policy. Using a national-level computable general equilibrium (CGE), we estimate the national impacts of removing deficiency payments, one of the primary components of U. S. farm programs. We then use two top-down methods of regionalization to analyze the <b>regional</b> <b>impacts.</b> While both top-down methods are easy to implement, the analysis demonstrates the importance of accounting for the presence of local linkages in assessing <b>regional</b> <b>impacts</b> of policy changes. The analysis indicates that elimination of the deficiency payment · program would result in efficiency gains at the national level, but because of the reallocation of resources, nonmetropolitan regions would lose and metropolitan regions would gain. Estimates of the <b>regional</b> <b>impacts</b> of national-level policies such as farm programs are essential in any comprehensive policy evaluation. Virtually all economic policies affect some industries and population groups more than others. Even if a policy is formulated without regard to location, the uneven spatial dis-tribution of producing sectors and of factors of production means that regiona...|$|R

[...] All of the halls are being named after influential alumni who the University feels represent the attributes of Hertfordshire graduates. In these two cases, the halls were named in recognition of Bellingham and Spalding's attributes of, intellectual depth and adaptability and professionalism, employability and enterprise. On the same year, University of Hertfordshire has been announced {{as one of the}} first recipients of the Race Equality Charter which is an initiative that recognises excellence in advancing racial equality in higher education. The charter was launched by the Equality Challenge Unit at the start of the 2015 academic year. The other recipients were: De Montfort University, King's College London, Kingston University, Staffordshire University, University College London, University of Manchester and Royal Holloway, University of London.|$|E

Furthermore, the thesis wants to show confrontation of these implications with the local authorities. High-speed railway {{will be an important}} backbone of the public transport in Czechia, in addition the capacitive Czech railway network connection to the rest of Europe will be made. The main tool of own research is half-structured interview, which leads to the characterization of the main expected <b>regional</b> <b>impacts</b> on Vysočina region. An important issue is the perception of infrastructure as an engine for regional development.
