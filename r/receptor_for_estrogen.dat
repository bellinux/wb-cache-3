40|$|Estrogen and {{progesterone}} or {{estrogen and}} glucocorticoid receptors functionally cooperate in gene activation if their cognate binding sites {{are close to}} one another. These interactions {{have been described as}} synergism of action of the steroid receptors. The mechanism by which synergism is achieved is not clear, although protein-protein interaction of the receptors is one of the favorite models. In transfection experiments with receptor expression vectors and a reporter gene containing estrogen and progesterone-glucocorticoid receptor binding sites, we have examined the effects that different portions of the various receptors have on synergism. N-terminal domains of the chicken progesterone and human glucocorticoid receptors, when deleted, abolished the synergistic action of these receptors with the estrogen receptor. Deletion of the carboxy-terminal amino acids 341 to 595 of the estrogen receptor produced a mutant receptor that could not trans-activate on its own. This mutant receptor did not affect the action of the glucocorticoid receptor but functioned synergistically with the progesterone receptor. We therefore conclude that the synergistic action of the <b>receptors</b> <b>for</b> <b>estrogen</b> and progesterone is mechanistically different from the synergistic action of the <b>receptors</b> <b>for</b> <b>estrogen</b> and glucocorticoid...|$|R

We compared the relationship between both hormone receptors and HER 2 /neu overexpression in different age groups taking other tumour characteristics into account. RESULTS: In a multivariate model, considering the overall group, a negative ER, a negative PR and a high tumour grade were predictive for HER 2 /neu overexpression (P 45 years, ER (P = 0. 001), PR (P = 0. 001) and tumour grade (P < 0. 001) were associated with HER 2 /neu (P < 0. 001).

40|$|STEROID HORMONES ACT in {{the brain}} to {{influence}} {{a wide variety of}} behavioral and physiological processes, largely by binding to intracellular steroid receptors (1, 2). It is well established that steroid receptors exert most of their effects in cells by binding to hormone response elements (HREs) on DNA and influencing gene transcription (3). Recent studies indicate that steroid receptors also interact with other regulatory proteins, nuclear receptor coactivators or corepressors, that increase or decrease, respectively, their binding and action at the HRE (4, 5). The nuclear coactivator found to enhance transcriptional activity of progestin receptors when bound to its HRE was termed steroid receptor coactivator- 1 (SRC- 1) because it also enhances the transcriptional activity of <b>receptors</b> <b>for</b> <b>estrogens,</b> androgens, glucocorticoids, and thyroid hormone (6).

The cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) -binding protein (CBP), which was originally identified as a coactivator for CREB (7, 8), appears to function as a nuclear receptor coactivator by interacting with SRC- 1 (9) and synergistically enhance steroid receptor action at the HRE (4, 10) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{endometrium}} is {{a complex}} steroid-responsive tissue that undergoes cyclic proliferation, hypertrophy, and differentiation in anticipation of embryo implantation. In the human, when pregnancy does not occur, menstrual shedding is followed by healing and intense proliferation in response to circulating estrogen resulting from ovarian follicular development. After ovulation, progesterone is secreted from the newly formed corpus luteum, transforming the endometrium into a secretory structure and establishing receptivity toward the nascent embryo, precisely and synchronously timed around a window of implantation [1]. Delays in the developmental milestones of the endometrium [2] can lead to infertility or pregnancy loss. Moreover, imbalance between the actions of estrogen and progesterone are associated with abnormal uterine bleeding [3] and proliferative disorders, such as endometriosis and endometrial hyperplasia [4]. Proges-terone {{is essential for the}} establishment of pregnancy [5], opposing the actions of estrogen by a remarkable number of different mechanisms. One recognized antiestrogenic action of progesterone in the endometrium is the regulation of the cognate <b>receptors</b> <b>for</b> <b>estrogen</b> and progesterone [6].

Identification of molecular markers such as expression of the <b>receptors</b> <b>for</b> <b>estrogen</b> (er) and progesterone (pgr) and the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her 2) has {{played an important role}} in determining targets for the development of efficacious drugs for treatment and has also offered additional predictive value for the therapeutic assessment of patients with breast cancer. More recent technical advancements in identifying several cancer-related genes have provided further opportunities to identify specific subtypes of breast cancer. Among the subtypes, tumours with triple-negative cells are identified using specific staining procedures for basal markers such as cytokeratin 5 and 6 and the absence of er, pgr, and her 2 expression. Patients with triple-negative breast cancers therefore have the disadvantage of not benefiting from currently available receptor-targeted systemic therapy. Optimal conditions for the therapeutic assessment of women with triple-negative breast tumours and for the management of their disease have yet to be validated in prospective investigations. The present review discusses the differences between triple-negative breast tumours and basal-like breast tumours and also the role of mutations in the BRCA genes. Attention is also paid to treatment options available to patients with triple-negative breast tumours...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) {{is a rare}} {{but often}} fatal disease, {{characterized}} by the abnormal proliferation of smooth muscle cells of the lung. LAM occurs almost exclusively in women and its pathology correlates with mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC 2) gene and expression of the hormone estrogen. One {{of the hallmarks of}} LAM lesions is the anomalous expression of the intracellular <b>receptor</b> <b>for</b> <b>estrogens,</b> ER, and the distinct gender specificity of LAM would support the hypothesis that this anomalous expression of ER plays an essential role in the pathology of the disease. Our previous studies have defined a direct link between the TSC 2 gene product tuberin and estrogen signaling through ER. The objectives of this study were to investigate epigenetic changes in the ER promoter as a mechanism for upregulation of ER expression in LAM disease. The results of this study provide evidence for: a) use of multiple ER promoters in human airway smooth muscle cells and LAM- associated cell lines, b) epigenetic changes in the promoter of the ER gene in LAM-associated cell lines and LAM lesions, and c) differential binding of histone deacetylase 1 and methyl-CpG binding proteins in human airway smooth muscle and LAM cells. These studies cumulatively suggest the upregulation of ER expression associated with LAM disease may in part be a consequence of demethylation at the ER promoter...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to evaluate the presence of GnRH receptors (GnRH-R) in breast cancer and not-involved breast tissue, and the relationships between GnRH-R and <b>receptors</b> <b>for</b> <b>estrogen</b> (ER) and progesterone (PgR) in the same tissues. Utilizing a tritiated natural GnRH in order to assay the native receptor binding we analyzed the level of binding sites for GnRH in membranes derived from 90 breast tumors and in 40 cases from neighboring, not-involved breast tissue. GnRH-R was found both in cancer and normal tissues. The prevalence for GnRH-R was higher in tumor than in not-tumor tissue (45 % vs 39 %, respectively), but the overall levels {{were not significantly different}} (15. 9 +/- 24 fmol/mg protein vs 18. 2 +/- 39 fmol/mg protein, respectively). The only statistically different content of GnRH-R we found concerned PgR negative vs PgR positive tumor tissues (mean content: 23 vs 11 fmol/mg protein, respectively in PgR- and PgR+ tumors, p= 0. 03 by t test); furthermore the proportion of GnRH-R positive cases in the tumor resulted significantly higher in premenopausal patients vs postmenopausal (56 % vs 32 %, by Chi square test, p< 0. 05). The GnRH receptors status of primary tumor and contiguous not-involved breast tissue resulted associated (overall agreement: 63 %, p< 0. 05) but no specific steroid patterns for GnRH-R positivity was observed...|$|R
40|$|Three {{kinds of}} {{established}} human pancreatic cancer cell lines (HPC- 1, 3 and 4) cultured in vitro were supplemented with various concentrations of peptide hormones, i. e. secretin, glucagon, caerulein and gastrin, and of steroid hormones, i. e. estrogen, testosterone and hydrocortisone. Effects of these hormones {{on the cell}} proliferation and secretion of tumor markers in the media were examined. Presence of the <b>receptors</b> <b>for</b> those hormones was investigated in each cell line. The results obtained were as follows: 1) The increase in cell number and 3 H-thymidine incorporation was facilitated in HPC- 1 cells by caerulein and estrogen, in HPC- 3 cells by secretin, glucagon, caerulein, gastrin and estrogen, and in HPC- 4 cells by estrogen. Under 10 - 4 M concentration of steroid hormones, estrogen showed cytotoxicity whereas testosterone and hydrocortisone resulted in the inhibition of proliferation in all cell lines. The inhibitory effect was more significant in testosterone. 2) Measurement of tumor markers secreted in the media was performed on beta 2 -microglobulin, pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor, CEA, CA 19 - 9 and HC- 2, a monoclonal antibody produced by using HGC- 25 cells. Beta 2 -microglobulin and HC- 2 were secreted by three cell lines, but the amount was parallel with the cell number, suggesting that the hormones {{did not have a}} significant influence on tumor marker secretion. 3) Presence of hormone receptors was assessed in each cell line, {{on the basis of the}} change of cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP level after hormone administration. It was suggested that there were <b>receptors</b> <b>for</b> caerulein in HPC- 1, and those for secretin, glucagon, caerulein and gastrin in HPC- 3. The existence of <b>receptors</b> <b>for</b> <b>estrogen</b> and testosterone was indicated by radioreceptor assay of steroid hormones in all cell lines...|$|R
