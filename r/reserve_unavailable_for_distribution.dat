40|$|Begonia L. {{is one of}} the ten largest plant genera with > 1, 830 {{currently}} accepted species {{distributed throughout}} the tropical Americas, Africa and Asia. This exceptional diversity offers the opportunity to study the processes underlying recent and rapid radiations, including the theory of adaptive radiations, but also poses major challenges. Methods to test adaptive radiation theory require sufficient occurrence data to produce species <b>distribution</b> models <b>for</b> the majority of species in a group. In many groups, including Andean, Central American and Mexican Begonia, this criterion is not met. The availability of specimen data on GBIF <b>for</b> species <b>distribution</b> modelling in vascular plants as a whole was assessed. The potential contribution of databased and freely available but indetermined or non-georeferenced specimens to the field of species distribution modelling was estimated. More than half of vascular plant species are currently <b>unavailable</b> <b>for</b> species <b>distribution</b> modelling. Our results indicate 22...|$|R
50|$|Other {{operating}} systems are actually more generic and {{are designed to}} mostly ignore the LINC side of things. These are PDP-8-only systems, although perhaps custom configured for {{the vagaries of the}} specifics of a LINC-8. In some cases, this means that they cannot be run on any other machine; in other cases, the LINC-8 merely represented a normal variation of drivers off of an otherwise non-descript PDP-8 system. An advantage of a PDP-8-based system is that PROGOFOP is superfluous here. If needed, the PDP-8 system could load PROGOFOP as well as a user program primarily LINC-oriented to get at the laboratory peripherals. The LINC convention of the entire first 1K being <b>unavailable</b> <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> PROGOFOP is exchanged for the far smaller PDP-8 convention of reserving only 07600-07777 or the last 128-word page of the first 4K of the machine. This corresponds to a small reserved area at the end of LINC segment 3 in exchange for much greater overall flexibility.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} evaluating the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the sum of order statistics, which serves to compute outage probability (OP) values at the output of generalized selection combining receivers. Generally, closed-form expressions of the CDF of the sum of order statistics are <b>unavailable</b> <b>for</b> many practical <b>distributions.</b> Moreover, the naive Monte Carlo (MC) method requires a substantial computational effort when the probability of interest is sufficiently small. In the region of small OP values, we propose instead two effective variance reduction techniques that yield a reliable estimate of the CDF with small computing cost. The first estimator, which {{can be viewed as}} an importance sampling estimator, has bounded relative error under a certain assumption that is shown to hold for most of the challenging distributions. An improvement of this estimator is then proposed for the Pareto and the Weibull cases. The second is a conditional MC estimator that achieves the bounded relative error property for the Generalized Gamma case and the logarithmic efficiency in the Log-normal case. Finally, the efficiency of these estimators is compared via various numerical experiments...|$|R

40|$|Capital {{maintenance}} rules {{are part of}} a legal capital regime that consists of rules on raising capital and rules on maintaining it. The function of these rules is the protection of the corporation’s creditors. This is evidenced by the fact that in public as well as private companies the provisions on legal capital are not open to disapplication or variation even with unanimous shareholder consent. Thus, providing the company with a minimum of funding and ensuring equal treatment of shareholders are mere reflexes of creditor protection or, at best, ancillary purposes of legal capital. Legal capital is part of a corporation’s equity. The key feature of equity is that it ranks behind the claims of other stakeholders in the distribution of a corporation’s assets. Consequently, equity will also be the first part of a corporation’s funds to be depleted by losses. Capital {{maintenance rules}} seek to enforce this order of priority of different groups of stakeholders by restricting distributions to shareholders. Such restrictions are not unique to legal systems that have adopted a legal capital regime. A prominent example of a statute that has eliminated mandatory legal capital is the Delaware General Corporation Law. § 154 DCGL leaves it up to the directors to decide whether any part of the consideration received by the corporation for its shares shall be attributed to capital. Thus, a Delaware corporation need not have any stated capital. This has significant impact on the funds available <b>for</b> <b>distribution</b> to shareholders. Pursuant to § 170 (a) DGCL dividends may only be paid out of surplus or, in the absence of surplus, out of net profits of the current or the preceding fiscal year. § 154 DGCL defines surplus as the excess of a corporation’s net assets over the amount of its capital, and net assets as the amount by which total assets exceed total liabilities. A corporation without stated capital may, therefore, distribute all of its net assets to its shareholders and continue business without any equity on its balance sheet. This highlights the difference between the different approaches to creditor protection in Germany and the U. S. Both legal systems acknowledge the priority of creditors over shareholders in corporate distributions. However, German law seeks to give creditors additional comfort by requiring companies to raise and maintain additional layers of assets above and beyond those corresponding to the company’s liabilities that may not be depleted by way of distributions to shareholders. While private companies must merely raise and maintain their stated capital, public companies are required to raise and maintain additional equity accounts <b>unavailable</b> <b>for</b> <b>distributions</b> to shareholders such as the share premium account 1 and the legal reserve. 2 In recent years a number of objections have been raised against this concept of creditor protection. Critics argue that contractual arrangements are a more efficient means for protecting the interests of creditors. 3 Capital maintenance does not prevent creditors from negotiating for more stringent protection of their claims such as collateral or financial covenants. It does, however, provide a minimum standard of protection for the benefit of creditors who lack the commercial experience or the bargaining power or who, like tort victims, are simply unable to negotiate for contractual safeguards. Capital maintenance ensures that their protection against excessive distributions does not depend on large creditors who are free to waive covenants that, in effect, benefit all creditors in exchange for individual arrangements that work exclusively in their favour...|$|R
