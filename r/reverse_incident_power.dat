40|$|We {{report a}} {{systematic}} study of time-resolved and power-dependent photoresponse in high-efficiency germanium quantum dot photodetectors (Ge-QD PDs), with internal quantum efficiencies greater than 100 over a broad wavelength, <b>reverse</b> bias, and <b>incident</b> <b>power</b> range. Turn-on and turn-off response times (τ on and τ off) are shown {{to depend on}} series resistance, bias, optical power, and thickness (W QD) of the Ge-QD layer, with measured τ off values down to ∼ 40 ns. Two different photoconduction regimes are observed at low and high reverse bias, with a transition around - 3 V. A transient current overshoot phenomenon is also observed, which depends on bias and illumination power. © 2012 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
40|$|<b>Reversing</b> vehicle <b>incidents</b> is a {{significant}} but often overlooked issues in organisations. Utilising three Australian organisations, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of reversing aids and a behaviour-change program in reducing reversing-related crashes in fleet settings. Reversing-related incidents increased from Time 1 to Time 2 in the organisation that did not implement a specific strategy to reduce their reversing-related crashes and in the organisation that implemented the reversing aids intervention. However, the increase was only statistically significant in the organisation that utilised the reversing aids technology. In this organisation, the odds of its drivers getting involved in a <b>reversing</b> <b>incident</b> has almost doubled from Time 1 and Time 2. In contrast, the frequency of <b>reversing</b> <b>incidents</b> in the organisation implementing the behaviour-change program has significantly decreased, with less than 50 % chance of its drivers being involved in a <b>reversing</b> <b>incident</b> from Time 1 to Time 2. The implications associated with these results will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{photoresponse}} of the graphene photodetector elucidated strong {{dependence on}} several optical parameters, {{such as the}} angle of incidence and the <b>incident</b> <b>power</b> of infrared exposure at room temperature. The sinusoidal dependence of the photoresponse on incidence angle, which had not been realized before, has now been revealed. The combined effect of the photo excited charge carrier and the photon drag effect explain this nonlinear optical absorption in graphene at lower <b>incident</b> <b>power.</b> The nonlinear dependence of the charge carrier generation on the <b>incident</b> <b>power</b> revealed that this process contributed to the nonlinear photoresponse. However, a deviation is observed at a higher <b>incident</b> <b>power</b> due to the induction of thermal effects in the graphene lattice.

40|$|International audienceDomain wall motions in ferroelectrics {{participate}} to the material's complex permittiv-ity and {{are responsible}} for their sensitivity of the dielectric properties to the driving electric field and thus to the <b>incident</b> <b>power</b> at microwave frequencies. In the present study, the dependence of the permittivity, the dielectric losses and the tunability of Ba 2 / 3 Sr 1 / 3 TiO 3 (BST) thin films on the <b>incident</b> <b>power</b> and on the bias fields is examined at a frequency of 500 MHz. While, the domain wall motion participates only slightly to the permittivity (< 5 %), it strongly influences the losses due to its very dissipative behavior. As a consequence, the Figure of Merit (FoM, ratio between tunability and dielectric losses) of the material depends on the applied microwave power. In the present study, a decrease of the FoM from 29 to 21 is observed for an <b>incident</b> <b>power</b> varying from − 20 dBm to 5 dBm.
