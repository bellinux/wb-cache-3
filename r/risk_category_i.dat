40|$|The pathway {{from the}} flash of a {{technological}} invention until its use as a medical device in every day care is tedious and burdensome. But the often postulated acceleration has to balance the speed of innovation and the indispensable product safety by an improved understanding of the innovation cycle. While several studies investigated {{the time course of}} pharmaceutical innovation, a comparable empirical analysis of medical devices is lacking. Thus we evaluated the time between the patent priority date and the corresponding receipt of the CE mark as a function of a medical device risk class in 61 cases. The statistical analysis yielded a time increment (trend) from medical devices in <b>risk</b> <b>category</b> <b>I</b> (median = 5. 8 years) compared to risk category III (median = 10. 4 years), which is close to literature reported values for drug development (9 – 12 years). The difference between products in risk classes I and II did not reach significance. To investigate the underlying facts, a text-mining approach especially to resolve the ambiguity of, e. g. patents, CE Marks etc. is suggested for increasing the sample size...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Dutch {{cardiovascular}} disease (CVD) prevention guidelines recommend {{the use of}} modified SCORE risk charts to estimate 10 -year risk of fatal and nonfatal CVD (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease and congestive heart failure). This combined risk {{is derived from the}} SCORE mortality risk using multipliers. These multipliers have been shown to underestimate overall CVD risk. We aimed to compare the current Dutch risk charts with charts that estimate a broader range of clinically relevant CVD using updated multipliers. METHODS: We constructed new risk charts for 10 -year CVD using updated, recently published multipliers from the EPIC-Norfolk study, based on ratios of fatal CVD to clinically relevant CVD (fatal plus nonfatal CVD requiring hospitalisation for ischaemic heart disease, cardiac failure, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, and aortic aneurysm). Our primary outcome was the proportion of the three <b>risk</b> <b>categories,</b> <b>i.</b> [*]e. 'high risk' (> 20 % 10 -year risk), 'intermediate risk' (10 - 19 %) and 'low risk' (< 10 %) in the new risk charts as compared with the current risk charts. RESULTS: Applying the updated fatal CVD/clinical CVD multipliers led to a marked increase in the high-risk categories (109 (27 %) vs. 244 (61 %), (p < 0. 001)), an absolute increase of 229 %. Similarly, the number of low-risk categories decreased (190 (48 %) vs. 81 (20 %) (p < 0. 001)). CONCLUSION: The current Dutch risk charts seriously underestimate the risk of clinical CVD, even in the first 10  years. Even when analyses are restricted to CVD events that required hospitalisation, true 10 -year risks are more than double the currently estimated risks. Future guidelines may be revised to reflect these findings...|$|R

However, the advantages have been overshadowed by the multiplicity of reporting systems and {{a wide range of}} nomenclature used. The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (TBSRTC) was formulated in 2007, to give the world a uniform thyroid cytology reporting system, facilitating easy interpretation by the clinicians. Here, we review the status of thyroid FNAC in India in terms of various reporting systems used including a meta-analysis of the previously published data. An extensive literature search was performed using internet search engines. The reports with detailed classification system used in thyroid cytology were included. The meta-analysis of published data was compared with the implied risk of malignancy by TBSRTC. More than 50 studies were retrieved and evaluated. TBSRTC is currently the most widely used reporting system with different studies showing good efficacy and interobserver concordance. Ancillary techniques have, as of now, limited applicability and acceptability in thyroid cytology in India. Twenty-eight published articles met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. When compared with TBSRTC recommendations, the meta-analysis showed a higher risk of malignancy for <b>categories</b> <b>I</b> and III. Thyroid FNAC is practiced all over India. TBSRTC has found widespread acceptance, with most institutions using this system for routine thyroid cytology reporting.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundRoutine {{management}} of hypertensive adults {{is based on}} assessment of risk factors for coronary artery disease; risk factors for heart failure (HF) remain poorly investigated despite the key role of hypertension in HF development. AimTo assess the components of HF risk in hypertensive adults in primary care, compare physicians’ estimations of HF and global cardiovascular risks with established calculation algorithms, and assess the concordance of these algorithms. MethodsO-PREDICT was a transverse, observational, multicentre French survey conducted in 2006 among general practitioners who included the first hypertensive, non-HF patient seen in each of three age classes (70 years). Estimations of HF and global cardiovascular risks (at 4 and 10 years, respectively) were performed subjectively during the consultation and calculated a posteriori according to algorithms from the Framingham cohort and the European SCORE database, respectively. For each of these methods, patients were stratified into four <b>risk</b> <b>categories</b> (<b>i.</b> e., no, low, moderate, high). ResultsOne thousand five hundred and thirty seven physicians recruited 4523 patients (61 % men; 64. 5 ± 10. 9 years; systolic blood pressure 149. 9 ± 15. 4 mmHg); most (67. 2 %) patients had one or two cardiovascular/HF risk factors (dyslipidaemia 48. 8 %, left ventricular hypertrophy 25. 3 %, diabetes 18. 8 %, coronary artery disease 8. 8 %, valvulopathy 6. 1 %); the number increased with advancing age and in men versus women. According to the Framingham algorithm, the risk of HF (mean 5. 4 ± 8. 5 %; 13. 4 % of patients at high risk) increased with advancing age (p< 0. 001), nearly doubling for each decade increase. According to the European SCORE system, global cardiovascular risk (mean 5. 4 ± 4. 3 %) was moderate or elevated in 48. 1 % of patients. Concordance between physicians’ estimations and theoretical calculations for HF and global risks was poor, as was concordance between algorithms (κw= 0. 28, 0. 12, 0. 11, respectively). ConclusionMore than one in 10 hypertensive patients seen in primary care is {{at high risk of}} HF at 4 years according to the Framingham model; this algorithm appears to offer additional information to that provided by the SCORE system. Physicians’ estimations of risks correlated poorly with algorithm calculations, suggesting that the use of these tools in general practice should be encouraged...|$|R
40|$|Background: Risk {{communication}} is a two way exchange of information, {{leading to a}} better understanding of risk. It can make use of pictograms which help patients to make decisions about their medicines. This study is part of the DRUID* project and will make use of pictograms related with medicines and driving. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of a pictogram in communicating risk associated with driving impairing medicines to patients. To assess patients’ level of understanding, and intention to change behaviour by looking at various pictograms. Methods: Two studies using a 2 x 3 design were conducted. In the first study, the respondents (patients visiting a community pharmacy with a driving license) were exposed to a condition in which the pictogram (DRUID or homologue French pictogram) and the <b>risk</b> <b>category</b> (<b>category</b> <b>I,</b> II or III) were manipulated. In this study, both pictograms were accompanied by the same side-text. In the second study, the added value of the side-text was examined. Here, the respondents were exposed to a DRUID pictogram with or without side-text and again one of the three <b>risk</b> <b>categories.</b> Results: 50. 7 % of the respondents were male with a mean age of 48. 4 years-old and with a high education level (45. 6 %). After observing both DRUID and French pictograms, respondents recognized the risk of driving while taking driving impairing medicines: 78. 8 % of the respondents were likely to change their behaviour and 36. 3 % said they would drive less frequently in the presence of a medicine with such pictograms. 40. 7 % wouldn’t drive anymore. Patients showed preference for the 3 categories presented in the DRUID pictogram and 73. 3 % of the respondents felt that the side-text of the DRUID pictogram was helpful. Conclusions: Both pictograms seem to be effective in communicating risk. With the DRUID pictogram there is a clear and direct correlation between the likelihood of changing driving behaviour and the level of impairment of a medicine: the higher the category, the more likely to change driving frequency (by driving less frequently). The DRUID pictogram was preferred over the French one. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

To counter the threat contained in their respective DBTs, both DOE sites and NRC licensees use physical security systems, such as alarms, fences, and other barriers; trained and armed security forces; and operational security procedures, such as a "two-person" rule that prevents unobserved access to special nuclear material. In addition, to ensure DBT requirements are being met and to detect potential security vulnerabilities, DOE and NRC employ a variety of other measures, including inspection programs; reviews; and force-on-force performance tests, in which the site's security forces undergo simulated attacks by a group of mock terrorists. Over the past several years, we have raised concerns about certain aspects of security at DOE sites and at NRC-regulated commercial nuclear power plants.

Methods: A retrospective, cross sectional chart review of patients who had attended the diabetic clinic in SPGH from January 2013 to December 2013  was performed. Patients were included if they had undergone a foot examination. Patients with amputation due to accident were excluded. The DF <b>risk</b> <b>category</b> was assessed by determining the proportion of patients in each of four risk categories, as described by the IWGDF consensus. Results: The study encompassed 144 records from patients reviewed for foot examination from January to December 2013. Patients’ ages were between 16 and 85 years, 46 (40 %) were male and 98 (60 %) were female. The majority (122, [85 %]) of patients were in DF <b>risk</b> <b>category</b> 0, whilst a limited number of patients were classified in <b>risk</b> <b>category</b> 1 (10, [6. 9 %]), <b>risk</b> <b>category</b> 2 (7, [4. 9 %]) and <b>risk</b> <b>category</b> 3 (5, [3. 5 %]).

Sixty-one patients were identified as good risk group, 27 patients as intermediate risk group, and 40 patients as poor risk group. The 1 -year cumulative incidence of complete cytogenetic response was 73 % in good risk patients, 40 % in intermediate risk patients, and 22 % in poor risk patients (P = 0. 0001). Event-free survival at 3 -year was 89 % in good risk group, 70 % in intermediate group, and 54 % in poor risk group (P = 0. 0001); the estimated 3 -year progression-free survival was 95 % in good <b>risk</b> <b>category,</b> 93 % in intermediate <b>risk</b> <b>category,</b> and 87 % in poor <b>risk</b> <b>category</b> (P = 0. 05).
