5000|$|The Class 20E has two cable sockets on {{each side}} of the coupler and a fifth socket in a cut-out on the sill, below the front door on the front sill and in the same {{position}} on the <b>rear</b> <b>sill,</b> near the right end of the sill. The Class 21E has no such cut-out in the sill. The radio frequency distributed power (RFDP) conjunction boxes are mounted below the sockets to the right hand side of the coupler.|$|E
50|$|There {{was only}} one body style for the Sunbeam, that of a three-door hatchback. The car was {{literally}} a hatchback, with the rear hatch formed out of {{a single piece of}} glass as seen previously on the Hillman Imp. This required a high <b>rear</b> <b>sill</b> to provide some structural rigidity and which consequently made the loading and unloading of luggage rather difficult. Although it was a good looking car with clean modern lines, the tricky luggage compartment and the lack of alternative bodystyles - the reasoning being that the Avenger range already offered saloon and estate variants - ultimately compromised the car's appeal in the UK market. The Sunbeam's main competitors in the UK, the Ford Fiesta, Vauxhall Chevette and Austin Metro, were produced in different body styles to cater for a broader range of customer.|$|E

50|$|On {{the night}} of August 14, 1990, Mello was {{observed}} with Gordon O'Brien, William Anthony, a recently paroled freelance hitman from West Warwick, as they sat in a parked car in on the East Side of Providence,Rhode Island. Although initially holding back on the assumption the three men may have been detectives, patrolman Frank Moody approached the car to investigate when Mello was seen taking a blackjack and throwing it onto the car's <b>rear</b> window <b>sill.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{mechanics}} of the car remained much the same with 1.1 and 1.4 petrol engines and Hydragas suspension, but there was now the option of a Peugeot-sourced 1.5 diesel rather than the previous 1.4. The exterior was altered {{in an attempt to}} disguise the car's age, meet the increased cooling requirements of the Peugeot motor and offer a reduced-format Rover family grille. This was achieved through fitment of new front and <b>rear</b> bumpers, <b>sill</b> covers, <b>rear</b> boot handle and headlamps, bonnet and grille.|$|R

2500|$|The Torino's engine, transmission, and {{upgraded}} {{interior fittings}} were unique to Argentina, {{and were not}} used {{on any of the}} U.S. market Ramblers. The engine was the Kaiser [...] overhead cam (OHC) six originally developed for the new 1963 Jeeps. The car was actually a 1963-1964 Rambler Classic passenger compartment with 1964-1965 Rambler American front and rear sections. The front suspension sills extended all the way under the floor to meet the <b>rear</b> suspension <b>sills,</b> a feature that made the Torino much stiffer than its U.S. produced cousins (The Rambler Marlin also used these long sills, but other models did not). The Torino handled the roads of the interior of the country very well while its engine acquired fame for being robust and reliable. The car was successful in Argentina. It was also entered in races against famous sport cars, including the [...] "84 hours of Nürburgring" [...] endurance race in 1969, where a Torino finished with the most laps, but was classified in fourth place due to penalties.|$|R
5000|$|The X350 was facelifted for the 2008 model year, {{a design}} {{unveiled}} {{at the end}} of February 2007. The car featured a mildly revised front grille and new front bumper assembly with a prominent lower grille. Branding changed from the cast bonnet ornament to a Jaguar emblem within the grille featured also on the XK and the XF. [...] The front lights had detail changes while the revised door mirrors incorporated side repeaters. The front wings on all models were remodelled to feature side vents, previously featured on the Super V8 Portfolio (and XJR Portfolio in the UK), while the side <b>sills,</b> <b>rear</b> bumper and tail lights were revised.|$|R
5000|$|The {{suspension}} {{was lowered}} by 10 mm over the standard models, and includes [...] "Audi Magnetic Ride" [...] as standard {{and a new}} two-stage sports-biased Electronic Stability Programme (ESP). [...] Radially ventilated front disc brakes are clamped by a single-piston gloss black caliper emblazoned with a bold TTS logo, and a lap timer is prominent in {{the centre of the}} instrument cluster. [...] 9Jx18" [...] '5-parallel-spoke' design alloy roadwheels are standard, with 245/40 ZR18 high-performance tyres. 19" [...] '5-spoke star' wheels and tyres are optional.

40|$|Natural {{ventilation}} {{is rapidly}} becoming {{a significant part}} in the design strategy of buildings in situations where electricity is scare or non-existent and saving energy becomes highly important. The aim of present work {{is to reduce the}} ceiling temperature by natural ventilation through different opening locations (one window in the front façade and the other window in the <b>rear</b> wall) with <b>sill</b> height ratio of 0. 27, 0. 36, 0. 45, 0. 54, and 0. 63. Wind tunnel and smoke tunnels were used to investigate the effect of opening locations on the temperature and heat transfer coefficient of a ceiling of a naturally-ventilated room. Here, the ANSYS CFD software was used to determine the flow characteristics in the ventilated room with different opening locations and wind direction. Better flow pattern and heat transfer from the heated ceiling are observed when the front and rear openings are located nearest to the ceiling and center, respectively. An experimental correlation was obtained to predict the influence of sill opening height ratio of front and rear walls on the average heat transfer coefficient ratio of ceiling) / (ohavh where) (oh is the heat transfer coefficient in case of no wind...|$|R
5000|$|Some gallery graves {{were not}} {{rectangular}} in shape, but rather narrowed toward the rear. These {{are known as}} wedge-shaped gallery graves. The ceilings of wedge-shaped gallery graves often sloped toward the <b>rear,</b> and a <b>sill</b> of stone set some distance inside the away from the entrance or one or two slabs set upright in the earth defined a sort of antechamber. The wedge-shaped gallery grave was usually topped by a cairn (covering of stones) rather than an earthen mound (or [...] "tumulus"), although an earthen mound was sometimes used. The cross-sectional shape of the cairn could be round, oval, or D-shaped, and often a kerb (ring of stone) was used to help revet the cairn and keep it in place. Some wedge-shaped gallery graves had curved rear walls, while others were linear. A few had the terminal burial chamber {{at the rear of}} the gallery, although this was usually blocked off. Wedge-shaped gallery graves sometimes had a set of outer walls. These could be parallel to the inner walls, or they could be set at an even stronger angle (emphasizing the wedge-like nature of the tomb). Wedge-shaped gallery graves usually faced west, and often had a pair of upright stone slabs linking the inner and outer walls at the entrance.|$|R
5000|$|The Sixty Special {{returned}} in 1987 {{as the top}} owner-driven model in the front-wheel-drive GM C-body lineup, with a planned production run of just 2,000 units. The 1987 and 1988 Sixty Specials were custom-crafted cars featuring a five-inch (127 mm) wheelbase stretch over the DeVille/Fleetwood on which they were based. Similarly equipped to the standard-size Fleetwood d'Elegance - the model on which it was based - the Sixty Special also included an anti-lock braking system (a $925 option on Fleetwood) and a stainless-steel exhaust system not available on other models. In 1987, Sixty Special was priced at $34,850 - more than $8,700 over {{the price of the}} Fleetwood d'Elegance. The price dropped by $100 for 1988. With their longer wheelbase, these cars were akin to [...] "mini-limousines" [...] that could be owner- or chauffeur-driven. In addition to 5 inches of extra rear seat leg room, they included exclusive amenities such as dual rear-seat headrests, three-position footrests (mounted onto the backs of the 55/45 split front seat) and two illuminated vanity mirrors located in an overhead console. A padded vinyl roof covering, which hid the body work where the additional section was added, carried over onto the elongated <b>rear</b> doors. Door <b>sill</b> plates and wide, ribbed lower body side moldings were positioned to hide the cobbled body work along the rocker panel.|$|R
