50|$|By way of comparison, a {{turbojet}} uses a gas turbine-driven fan {{to compress}} the air further.

These modern engines use a gas turbine engine core with high overall pressure ratio (about 40:1 in 1995) and high turbine entry temperature (about 1800 K in 1995), and provide {{a great deal of}} their thrust with a turbine-power fan stage, rather than with pure exhaust thrust as in a turbojet.

40|$|International audienceHydrodynamic {{pressures}} {{generated by}} a nonexploding projectile penetrating a fuel tank can be very destructive. During the impact, the projectile transfers momentum and kinetic energy to the container through the surrounding fluid. In aerospace industry, hydrodynamic <b>ram</b> <b>effects</b> are identified as an important factor for aircraft vulnerability because fuel tank of the aircraft is the most vulnerable component because the tank represents the largest exposed area to outside projectiles. Understanding {{the magnitude of the}} pressure and its distribution inside the tank is critical for designing the structure to survive these incidents. Numerical simulation when validated by tests data is an efficient tool to investigate mechanical phenomena of hydrodynamic <b>ram</b> <b>effects</b> and its damage on the surrounding structure. The main numerical difficulties that can be encountered in this kind of problems and in general penetration problems is the high mesh distortion of the fluid at the fluid-structure interface during projectile penetration. To prevent high mesh distortion of the fluid, a coupling method is used for the fluid as well as a new coupling algorithm is performed at the fluid-structure interface. The coupling method used in the paper has been developed with the collaboration of the first author in the ls-dyna code and validated for several applications in automotive and aerospace industry for fuel sloshing tank and bird impact problems. In this paper, experimental investigation has been performed and predicted pressure is compared with measured pressure for validation. In addition, modeling parameters such as element size and coupling parameters for the fluid structure coupling are investigated. The purpose of the research is to demonstrate the capability and potential of the fluid structure interaction for simulating this type of problems.

40|$|This thesis summarises and {{discusses}} results of studies concerning the ovarian and endocrine responses of anestrous ewes to the <b>ram</b> <b>effect,</b> {{the relation between}} the use of progestogen primings and the reproductive response of anestrous and cyclic ewes to the <b>ram</b> <b>effect,</b> and the endocrine and testicular changes in rams used to stimulate anestrous ewes. Ovarian responses to the <b>ram</b> <b>effect</b> (monitored ultrasonographically) were highly variable. Ewes responded with two luteal phases (short and normal, respectively), delayed ovulations (Days 5 - 7) followed by normal or short luteal phases, luteinization of non-ovulatory follicles, luteinized follicular cyst and no luteal phase. There was no relation between the growth status of the largest follicle present when rams were introduced and the ovarian responding pattern of anoestrous ewes to the <b>ram</b> <b>effect.</b> Similar results in estrus incidence and fertility were obtained after using intravaginal sponges containing medroxyprogesterone acetate (MAP) for 6, 9, or 13 days. Priming with sponges containing 20, 40, or 60 mg of MAP for 6 days gave similar reproductive results. Six-day primings with sponges impregnated with MAP or fluorogestone acetate, or intravaginal devices containing progesterone (CIDR) were equally effective in improving the response to the <b>ram</b> <b>effect.</b> A single administration of 2. 5 mg of MAP 1, 3, or 5 days before the introduction of the rams concentrated estrus in ewes 17 to 20 days later. In MAP-primed ewes, the endocrine pattern of the induced follicular phase of ewes that came into estrus was similar to a normal follicular phase, in ewes that ovulated without expressing estrus no significant increase in estradiol- 17 b or decrease in FSH was observed. The <b>ram</b> <b>effect</b> does not seem to affect the ovarian response of cyclic ewes during the midbreeding season. Rams used to stimulate anestrous ewes show an increase in LH and testosterone concentrations beginning at 12 h after joining, and high concentrations are maintained while estrous ewes are present and mating takes place in the flock.

40|$|Exposure of anoestrous ewes to rams induces {{oestrous cycles}} (the 'ram effect'). This {{response}} is poor in young-sexually naive females, possibly {{because they lack}} sexual experience and are sensitive to stress. Firstly, we assessed the conditions required for the acquisition of sexual experience. We exposed naive females at 5 or 9 months of age to rams and subsequently assessed their response at I year of age, to the <b>ram</b> <b>effect.</b> Unexpectedly, 2 weeks pre-exposure at 5 months and under some conditions at 9 months, inhibited the <b>ram</b> <b>effect</b> at I year of age, suggesting that early contact with rams was stressful and had long-term negative effects on reproduction. Consequently, we assessed the combined effect of stress and sexual experience on responses to the <b>ram</b> <b>effect.</b> At 9 months of age, we pre-exposed naive females using sexually active rams to achieve 'positive' (voluntary contact) or 'negative' (forced contact) experiences, and assessed responses to the <b>ram</b> <b>effect</b> at a year of age. In parallel, we subjected naive females to stressful conditions {{at the time of}} the male effect. During pre-exposure, females with 'negative' contact exhibited more vigilance and stress cues and had higher levels of cortisol than 'positive' contact ewes. Regardless of pre-exposure or stress, the response to the <b>ram</b> <b>effect</b> at a year of age was inhibited. These experiments confirm that contact with sexual partners can be stressful to young ewes and highlight the need to consider their emotional state when conditioning them to the presence of rams and when managing breeding programs.

40|$|Reproduction in mammals is {{controlled}} by the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis under the influence of external and internal factors such as photoperiod, stress, nutrition, and social interactions. Sheep are seasonal breeders and stop mating when day length is increasing (anestrus). However, interactions with a sexually active ram during this period can override the steroid negative feedback responsible for the anoestrus state, stimulate LH secretion and eventually reinstate cyclicity. This is known as the <b>ram</b> <b>effect</b> and research into the mechanisms underlying it is shedding new light on HPG axis regulation. The first step in the <b>ram</b> <b>effect</b> is increased LH pulsatile secretion in anestrus ewes exposed to a sexually active male or only to its fleece, the latter finding indicating a pheromone-like effect. Estradiol secretion increases in all ewes and this eventually induces a LH surge and ovulation, just as during the breeding season. An exception is a minority of ewes that exhibit a precocious LH surge (within 4 h) with no prior increase in estradiol. The main olfactory system and the cortical nucleus of the amygdala are critical brain structures in mediating the <b>ram</b> <b>effect</b> since it is blocked by their inactivation. Sexual experience is also important since activation (increased c-fos expression) in these and other regions is greatly reduced in sexually naïve ewes. In adult ewes kisspeptin neurons in both arcuate and preoptic regions and some preoptic GnRH neurons are activated 2 h after exposure to a ram. Exposure to rams also activates noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus and A 1 nucleus and increased noradrenalin release occurs in the posterior preoptic area. Pharmacological modulation of this system modifies LH secretion in response to the male or his odor.

From the beginning of August until the end of August oestrous behaviour was recorded by daily checks of mating marks on ewes. Rams were removed and in October all ewes were scanned (day 50) for pregnancy. No significant differences were found in the parameters investigated. Eighty-two percent of the L and 75. 4 % of the H ewes exhibited oestrus, with a pronounced peak on day 23 following ram introduction and a compact concentration in the 21 - 25 -day period. The oestrous synchronisation rate in this 5 -day period was 69. 4 and 68. 3 %, respectively for L and H. The mean interval from ram introduction to oestrus was 23. 17 +/- 2. 4 days in L and 23. 0 +/- 2. 2 days in the H group. Conception rates were 84. 3 and 87. 4 % for L and H groups, respectively. These results suggest that the response of anoestrous ewes to the introduction of rams was not affected by grazing space allowances and that yearling Mule ewes respond well to the <b>ram</b> <b>effect</b> in the late anoestrus season.

These problems are computer time consuming and require new stable and accurate coupling algorithms to be solved. For the last decades, the new development of coupling algorithms, and the increasing of computer performance have allowed to solve some of these problems and some more physical applications that has not been accessible in the past; in the future this trend is supposed to continue to take into account more realistic problem. In this presentation, numerical simulation using FSI capabilities in LS-DYNA, of hydrodynamic <b>ram</b> pressure <b>effect</b> occurring in nuclear industry is presented...|$|R
50|$|The V10 {{was also}} sold to British luxury car {{manufacturer}} Bristol Cars: the Bristol Fighter was {{powered by a}} modified version of the engine which produced 525 hp (391 kW), increasing to 550 hp (410 kW) at high speed due to the <b>ram</b> air <b>effect.</b> In the more powerful Fighter S the engine was tuned to give 628 hp (660 hp at high speed). Bristol had also planned to produce the Fighter T, the V10 would have been further modified and turbocharged to produce 1,012 hp (755 kW) bhp at 5600 rpm, slightly more than the advertised 1,001 hp of the Bugatti Veyron, however Bristol have since stated that no Fighter T models were produced.|$|R
