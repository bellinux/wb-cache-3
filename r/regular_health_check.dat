40|$|Dystrophinopathy {{is caused}} by {{mutations}} in the dystrophin gene at Xp 21. Although manifesting carriers of dystrophinopathy have been documented in adults, symptomatic dystrophinopathy in female children is rare. We report on a 13 -year-old girl with initial presentation of myalgia at age 7 years and an incidental finding of increased transaminases and creatine kinase at <b>regular</b> <b>health</b> <b>check</b> at age 12 years. At age 13 years, manual muscle testing revealed asymmetric bilateral proximal weakness of extremities. Slight calf hypertrophy and winged scapulae were found. Muscle biopsy revealed a mosaic pattern in dystrophin immunostaining. Mutation analysis of the dystrophin gene revealed a novel de novo c. 1150 - 2 delA mutation. Accordingly, the patient {{was found to be}} an isolated dystrophinopathy carrier, manifesting limb-girdle pattern of muscle weakness in her childhood. This report suggests that dystrophinopathy should always be considered in female patients with sporadic myopathy.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{assessed}} {{the prevalence of}} low back pain (LBP) and investigated risk factors for LBP among seafood processing factory workers in Thailand including migrant workers. The subjects were Thai and Myanmar workers in the typical seafood processing factory. A cross-sectional study was carried out with a self-administered questionnaire. Prevalence of LBP, general characteristics, life style, and working condition were investigated. The associations between LBP and risk factors were estimated by multiple logistic regression models. Of 254 workers, 165 completed the questionnaire. Half of these workers were Thai, the others were from Myanmar. The point prevalence of LBP was 28. 5 %. Risk factors for LBP were age over 40 yr, poor health status, history of back injury, twisting posture at work, and slipping on wet floors. The results suggest that health promotion should focus on working conditions rather than individual life style {{in order to prevent}} LBP. Furthermore, greater attention to other risk factors such as history of back injury and perception of health status after <b>regular</b> <b>health</b> <b>check</b> up, especially in older age groups may be needed...|$|E

50|$|Widespread {{prostitution}} {{began in}} the early 1800s, when the number of concubines kept by the Royal Netherlands East Indies soldiers and government officials declined; native men leaving their wives to look for work in other areas also contributed to its rise. In 1852 the colonial government began requiring <b>regular</b> <b>health</b> <b>checks</b> of prostitutes to check for syphilis and other venereal diseases; prostitutes also had to carry identification cards. These did not curb the growth of prostitution, which increased dramatically during a period of extensive construction in the late 1800s.|$|R
40|$|The UKK for the {{informal}} sector fishermen in east Lombok, NTB {{is important to be}} studied. This due to the location of East Lombok is across PT. Newmont NTB. This research is an observational study. Data and information collected from the staff and head of Dinas Kesehatan Kabupaten Lombok Timur, the head of Puskesmas and the fishermen. The result of the research shows that UKK for fishermen in East Lombok is already done by DinKes and it is included in the health Promotion Program. Puskeamas who held the program are Puskesmas Sangkapura and Puskesmas Keruah. In this two Puskesmas the majority are fishermen. Dinas Kelautan dan Perikana NTB supports the program by giving new facilyties which then used as Puskesmas pembantu. The health profile is still low. The conclusion is that UKK for fishermen is already done, but the health promotion, the society health status, and the housing environment are bad condition. The suggestion of this research is that UKK program should be increased by adding <b>regular</b> <b>health</b> <b>check</b> up and first aid. Keywords: UKK, fishermen, housing environment...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To analyse brand {{nicotine}} yield including “ultra low ” brands (that is, cigarettes yielding < 0. 1 mg {{of nicotine}} by Federal Trade Commission (FTC) methods) {{in relation to}} nicotine intake (urinary nicotine, cotinine and trans- 3 ’-hydroxycotinine) among 246 Japanese male smokers. Design: Cross sectional study. Setting: Two companies in Osaka, Japan. Subjects: 130 Japanese male workers selected randomly during their annual <b>regular</b> <b>health</b> <b>check</b> up and 116 Japanese male volunteers {{taking part in a}} smoking cessation programme. Main outcome measurements: Subjects answered a questionnaire about smoking habits. Following the interview, each participant was asked to smoke his own cigarette and, after extinguishing it, to blow expired air into an apparatus for measuring carbon monoxide concentration. Urine was also col-lected for the assays of nicotine metabolites. Results: We found wide variation in urinary nicotine metabolite concentrations at any given nicotine yield. Based on one way analysis of variance (ANOVA), the urinary nicotine metabolite concentrations of ultra low yield cigarette smokers were significantly lower compared to smokers of high (p = 0. 002) and medium yield cigarettes (p = 0. 017).

40|$|In {{the period}} of {{developing}} innovation, the anticipation to live more has expanded many-a-folds. If a patient prefers to visit a doctors on a day to day basis for tests like stress level detection, ECG or blood pressure tests the expenditure becomes too high. It even gets worse in remote areas where the costly equipment for the mentioned test are not available. In this paper idea about a portable device is presented, which {{is meant to be}} a portable and easy to use medical equipment for acquiring ECG signal. The raw signal generated on the human body surface due the polarization and depolarization of heart is acquired through a hand held module and transmitted to a laptop/mobile for analysis. In this way <b>regular</b> <b>health</b> <b>check</b> can be done with ease. Using a 3 lead ECG sensors, real time data is obtained directly from the subject using a DAQ (Data Acquisition Module). Then it is transmitted using Bluetooth and microcontroller, and the final analysis and display part is done on the computer/laptop/phone. Hence a low cost, low power consuming device with higher connectivity options can make great changes in health care secto...|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} effect of health {{management}} {{on the health of}} a community-based sample of people aged 65 years and over, a cross-sectional survey was carried out of 1491 people aged 65 years and over (22. 3 %) randomly drawn from the computerized age-sex register in Settsu City, Osaka. A total of 1473 people were contacted and complete responses were obtained from 1383 of these (a response rate of 93. 9 %). The proportion of the sample who had been receiving <b>regular</b> <b>health</b> <b>checks</b> or had been taking care of their health decreased with a decline in Activities of Daily Living (ADL). This trend was more pronounced among the younger subjects aged 65 — 74 years. For disability, those who had been receiving <b>regular</b> <b>health</b> <b>checks</b> had lower overall severity scores in both the 65 - 74 years and 75 years and over age groups. There {{were no significant differences in}} the severity scores for those practising health maintenance (watching diet and exercise) in both age groups, but those practising health maintenance tended to have less disability. The percentage of those who were socially active and thought life worth living also decreased with the decline in ADL for both age groups. These psycho-social factors were also associated with a lower overall severity score. A multiple linear regression analysis showed that <b>health</b> <b>checks,</b> social activity and the presence of aspects of life subjectively evaluated as making it worth living (Ikigai) were shown to have statistically significant negative associations with disability when other factors were controlled for...|$|R

50|$|Overseeing 15 {{resident}} prostitutes, Noyce {{was able}} to draw on up to 25 other women in busy periods. Her employees apparently had <b>regular</b> <b>health</b> <b>checks.</b> Queues formed around the block when certain ships were in port. When the aircraft carrier USS John F.

Noyce was charged 47 times for living off immoral earnings, generally paid the fine instantly, and served a four-month prison sentence in 1972, her last period in custody. Local councillors commented that they received more complaints when Noyce was in prison because her business was less well managed.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This article {{reports the}} {{prevalence}} and prediction factors of undiagnosed and uncontrolled hypertension among {{the adults in}} rural Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional study of the major noncommunicable disease risk factors was conducted in rural surveillance sites of Bangladesh in 2005. In addition to the self-report questions on risk factors, height, weight, and blood pressure were measured using standard protocols of the WHO STEPwise approach to Surveillance. Undiagnosed hypertension was defined when people reported no hypertension but were found hypertensive when measured, and uncontrolled hypertension was defined when people reported receiving antihypertensive treatment but their blood pressure was above the normal range when measured. Results: The prevalence of undiagnosed hypertension was 11. 1 %, increasing with age to 22. 7 % among those aged 60 years and above. Among the hypertensive patients receiving treatment, 54. 9 % {{were found to be}} uncontrolled (34. 5 % among 25 – 39 years and 67. 9 % among 60 + years). Increasing age and higher BMI were significantly positively associated with undiagnosed hypertension in multivariate analysis. Increasing age and more wealth have significant independent association with uncontrolled hypertension. Conclusion: High prevalence of undiagnosed hypertension, and more than 50 % of the treated hypertension being uncontrolled puts a great challenge ahead for Bangladesh, a resource-poor setting. <b>Regular</b> <b>health</b> <b>check</b> or health screening along with implementation of hypertensive guidelines should be reinforced...|$|E
40|$|Objectives To {{examine the}} {{adherence}} by senior NHS medical {{staff to the}} BMA guidelines on the ethical responsibilities of doctors towards themselves and their families. Design Postal semistructured questionnaire. Setting Four randomly selected NHS trusts and three local medical committees in South Thames region. Subjects Consultants and principals in general practice. Main outcome measures Personal use of health services. Results The response rate was 64 % (724) for general practitioners and 72 % (427) for consultants after three mailings. Most (1106, 96 %) respondents were registered with a general practitioner, although little use was made of their services. 159 (26 %) general practitioners were registered with a general practitioner in their own practice and 80 (11 %) admitted to looking after members of their family. 73 (24 %) consultants would never see their general practitioner before obtaining consultant advice. Most consultants and general practitioners admitted to prescribing {{for themselves and their}} family. Responses to vignettes for different health problems indicated a general reluctance to take time off, but there were differences between consultants and general practitioners and by sex. Views on improvements needed included the possibility of a "doctor's doctor," access to out of area secondary care, an occupational health service for general practitioners, and <b>regular</b> <b>health</b> <b>check</b> ups. Conclusion The guidelines are largely not being followed, perhaps because of the difficulties of obtaining access to general practitioners outside working hours. The occupational health service should be expanded and a general practitioner service for NHS staff piloted...|$|E
40|$|Malnutrition is {{associated}} with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality, and may case an undesirable effect on the growth and development in children. There have been several reports about the prevalence of malnutrition in hospitalized children, but reports about malnutrition in a large number of healthy children are quite limited. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the prevalence of likelihood of malnutrition in Japanese healthy children. We retrospectively reviewed data of height and weight at a <b>regular</b> <b>health</b> <b>check</b> in 7517 healthy children (age 3 - 17; 3747 boys, 3770 girls) during 2008 and 2010 in Nara city, Japan. The data were evaluated using Waterlow classification, i. e., weight-for-height (W/H) and height-for-age (H/A). The prevalence of under-nutrition, as estimated by the values of W/H less than 90 % and H/A less than 95 %, were 20. 1 % and 8. 3 %, respectively, and this prevalence of malnutrition risk tended to vary substantially with age. The peak levels of the prevalence were found to be at around 12 years old for both sexes in W/H, and at around 11 years old for boys and at around 10 years old for girls in H/A. We have clearly demonstrated the existence of certain percentages of the likelihood of malnutrition at different ages in healthy children. These findings suggest that when we want to evaluate the nutritional status using Waterlow classification in hospitalized children, we should be careful by taking such reference values into account...|$|E

However, those with severe asthma, most of whom will not grow out of their symptoms, need hospital-based care as well. As they progress through adolescence teenagers become increasingly uncomfortable in paediatric wards and outpatient clinics. They need clinics where they can meet the chest physician who will take on their care before they transfer to a clinic for adults (table 5). Adolescent asthmatic patients are a distinct group of patients with different treatment requirements from either paediatric or adult patients.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} simple and fast {{approach}} to extract essential parameters of a transverse feedback system such as phase advances between pick-ups and kickers, fractional tune, kicker delay, or per-bunch transverse activity from discrete-time samples of position signals. In this approach the beam is excited and subsequent beam oscillations are recorded. Given that any number of pick-ups can be evaluated at once with only a marginal increase of transverse beam size this method is suitable for <b>regular</b> <b>health</b> <b>checks</b> of a transverse feedback system, e. g., for every injection. The fundamental idea relies on {{the reconstruction of the}} transverse phase space by means of digital filters. We sketch a simple mathematical model to illustrate the underlying method.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} general practitioners’ (GPs) {{experiences in}} managing patients with intellectual disabilities (ID) and mental and behavioural problems (MBP). Design: Qualitative study using in-depth interviews. Setting: General practice in Hedmark county, Norway. Participants: 10 GPs were qualitatively interviewed about their professional experience regarding patients with ID and MBP. Data were analysed by all authors using systematic text condensation. Results: The participants’ knowledge was primarily experience-based and collaboration with specialists {{seemed to be}} individual rather than systemic. The GPs provided divergent attitudes to referral, treatment, collaboration, <b>regular</b> <b>health</b> <b>checks</b> and home visits. Conclusions: GPs {{are in a position}} to provide evidence-based and individual treatment for both psychological and somatic problems among patients with ID.
