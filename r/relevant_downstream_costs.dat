40|$|We {{consider}} {{a new class}} of online optimization problems, the Online Target Date Assignment Problem (OnlineTDAP). An instance of such a problem consists of a sequence of requests of a certain type and a so called downstream offline optimization problem whose input consists of requests of the same type. Additionally, each request has a release date and a set of feasible target dates for its service. The task is to assign requests to feasible target dates. Now, the <b>downstream</b> <b>cost</b> at one date of some target date assignment is the minimal <b>cost</b> of the <b>downstream</b> problem, where the input consists of all requests that have been assigned to that date. The goal is to find a feasible assignment of requests to target dates with the objective to minimize the total <b>downstream</b> <b>costs</b> over all target dates, or, to minimize the maximum <b>downstream</b> <b>costs</b> over all target dates. We provide general algorithms for the OnlineTDAP independently of a downstream problem. And we analyze their worst-case performance considering downstream problems bin-packing, nonpreemptive scheduling on identical parallel machines and a traveling salesman problem...|$|R

40|$|Many online {{problems}} {{encountered in}} real-life involve a twostage decision process: upon {{arrival of a}} new request, an irrevocable firststage decision (the assignment of a specific resource to the request) must be made immediately, while in a second stage process, certain “subinstances” (that is, the instances of all requests assigned to a particularresource) can be solved to optimality (offline) later. We introduce the novel concept of an Online Target Date Assignment Problem (OnlineTDAP) as a general framework for online problems with this nature. Requests for the OnlineTDAP become known at certain dates. An online algorithm has to assign a target date to each request, specifying on which date the request should be processed (e. g., an appointment with a customer for a washing machine repair). The cost at a target date is given by the <b>downstream</b> <b>cost,</b> the optimal cost of processing all requests at that date w. r. t. some fixed downstream offline optimization problem (e. g., {{the cost of an}} optimal dispatch for service technicians). We provide general competitive algorithms for the Online- TDAP independently of the particular downstream problem, when the overall objective is to minimize either the sum or the maximum of all <b>downstream</b> <b>costs.</b> As the first basic examples, we analyze the competitive ratios of our algorithms for the particular academic downstream problems of bin-packing, nonpreemptive scheduling on identical parallel machines, and routing a traveling salesman. operations research and management science;...|$|R

Hypertension poses a huge {{financial}} risk to any funder/medical aid, including the risk-mitigating strategies {{provided by the}} managed care organisations that are required to manage patients with hypertension. The South African Hypertension Guideline states that the choice of therapy – an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) – {{should be based on}} cost and tolerability. OBJECTIVE. To assess the costs of ACEIs v. ARBs in the management of hypertensive patients and the prevention of cardiovascular complications for a private medical aid scheme in South Africa. METHOD. A Phase IV observational, retrospective cohort study of over 480 000 beneficiaries between 2010 and 2011 was undertaken. Hypertensive patients were identified by their chronic medication authorisation and were categorised into three groups: ACEI, ARB and combined groups. A cost-benefit analysis was performed on the claims data, comparing the input costs in rand against the <b>downstream</b> <b>costs</b> using analysis of variance. RESULTS. Data from 28 165 patients were included in the study. Based on the health economic analysis that was performed, there was no statistically significant difference in the input costs between the ACEI and the ARB groups. However, a statistically significant reduction in the <b>downstream</b> <b>costs</b> was observed in the ACEI group v. the ARB and combined groups (p< 0. 0001). CONCLUSION. It is more cost beneficial to treat chronic hypertensive patients with an ACEI than ARBs in preventing cardiovascular-related complications. It is recommended that managed care companies continue recommending ACEIs rather than ARBs in the treatment of hypertensive patients. [URL]...|$|R

In this study, we found that c-Jun blocks erythroid differentiation in primary human hematopoietic progenitors and, correspondingly, that Jun factors block transcriptional activation by GATA- 1, the central regulator of erythroid differentiation. Mutagenesis of c-Jun suggested that its repression of GATA- 1 occurs through a transcriptional mechanism involving activation of downstream genes. We identified the hairy-enhancer-of-split-related factor HERP 2 as a novel gene upregulated by c-Jun. HERP 2 showed physical interaction with GATA- 1 and repressed GATA- 1 transcriptional activation.
