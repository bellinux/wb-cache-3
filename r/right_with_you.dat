500|$|On May 29, Conley {{was interviewed}} for four hours. His new {{affidavit}} said that Frank told him, [...] "he {{had picked up}} a girl back there and let her fall and that her head hit against something." [...] Conley said he and Frank took the body to the basement via the elevator, then returned to Frank's office where the murder notes were dictated. Conley then hid in the wardrobe after the two {{had returned to the}} office. He said Frank gave him $200, but took it back, saying, [...] "Let me have that and I will make it all <b>right</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> Monday if I live and nothing happens." [...] Conley's affidavit concluded, [...] "The reason I have not told this before is I thought Mr. Frank would get out and help me out and I decided to tell the whole truth about this matter." [...] At trial, Conley changed his story concerning the $200. He said Frank decided to withhold the money until Conley had burned Phagan's body in the basement furnace.|$|E

6000|$|... "All <b>right,</b> I'm <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> Jack," [...] said Randy. And {{together}} {{they made their}} way out on the rocks mentioned and the others slowly and cautiously followed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have made}} it all <b>right</b> <b>with</b> Hudig. <b>You</b> owe him nothing now. Go back to your wife. She is a good woman. Go back to her." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her {{heart was}} beating fast, but she bravely faced him. [...] "Yes, Mart, I don't feel <b>right</b> living <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> and {{spending}} your money the way I've been doing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, Johnny, this suits me!--suits yours truly, you bet, you! I {{want this}} shebang all day. I'm on it, old man! Let 'em out! Make 'em go! We'll {{make it all}} <b>right</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> sonny!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That settles it. If it's Bronx Park I'm <b>right</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> my son, unless Hal has {{something}} else planned," [...] interrupted Pat. [...] "In that case, why, I {{be in the}} hands av me frind, of course." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And indeed I don't think I {{could help}} holding to him, because he seems my one stay and hope here; and now I {{know it is}} all <b>right</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> indeed it is such {{happiness}} as I never knew." ...|$|E
60|$|JOHNNY. [Taking {{her by the}} arm] All <b>right!</b> I'll come <b>with</b> <b>you.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} go on that account! I feel that the safest place will be <b>right</b> here <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> for your people love you. I am not afraid when I am near you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{he shall}} {{turn to the}} <b>right</b> about <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> sir;--in double quick time too; do ye hear? I know you rascals well enough. Turn about, you sir, and take the gentleman where he directed." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS WHITEFIELD. You shouldn't {{say things}} like that, Jack. I hope you won't tell Ann that I have been {{speaking}} to you. I only wanted to set myself <b>right</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> and Tavy. I couldn't sit mumchance and have everything put on me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} {{she wished to}} set herself <b>right</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> but not from the same wish that Miss Andrews would have had. Miss Andrews would not have wished you {{to know the truth}} for her own sake. Her motive would have been direct-straight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{came here}} with Mr. Marley, of Rayville, to get the machine. It got away from us and landed in the river. We dragged it over here," [...] {{explained}} Dick. [...] "We'll make it <b>right</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> for using the lot," [...] he added, with a smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "We're {{bound for}} the Indian Spring Bottom with an H {{triangle}} draft," [...] he said. [...] "The grass is just frizzled on the Blackfeet run, and we figured we'd camp <b>right</b> here <b>with</b> <b>you</b> to-night." ...|$|R
5000|$|The song {{looks back}} at a {{relationship}} [...] "Through The Years" [...] and mentions the ups and downs, but the singer proclaims to his loved one: I'm so glad I stayed <b>right</b> here <b>with</b> <b>you</b> / Through the years.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} is! Morton, old chap, <b>you</b> shall go <b>with</b> us, never fear!" [...] Cecil {{declared}} vigorously. [...] "Tell you what, Len, if you won't do the agreeable and make things <b>right</b> <b>with</b> Fothergill--as <b>you</b> can, if you like, of course--I shan't go, so there! Which {{is it to}} be--both or neither?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Over the {{telephone}} he said: [...] "Ruth dear, I'll be right there. Walked all night. Got straightened out now. I'm out at Mineola. It's {{all right with}} me now, blessed. I want so frightfully much {{to make it all}} <b>right</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> I'll be there in about an hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} know you, {{and very}} thankful for {{what you have done}} for me. I'll make it <b>right</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> when I'm able to get around. My name is Dawson--Barwell Dawson. I'm a {{traveler}} and hunter, and occasionally I write articles for the magazines--hunting articles mostly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my dear, I {{think that}} perhaps {{she is not}} so wrong there. Of course {{everything}} is all <b>right</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> now, and I'm sure I'm the happiest {{woman in the world}} to feel that it is so. I don't know how to be thankful enough when I think how things have turned out;--but when I first heard of him I thought he was dangerous too." ...|$|E
5000|$|During the Philadelphia Mob War, Caramandi said, [...] "He'd {{never ask}} you to do {{something}} he wouldn't do himself. He was <b>right</b> out there <b>with</b> <b>you</b> (on murder contracts)." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I feel convinced," [...] he said, [...] "that you are <b>right.</b> I agree <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> I {{believe that}} Inspector Jacks has had that idea for some little time now." ...|$|R
6000|$|She was {{relieved}} to hear that I had no mental troubles to complain of. [...] "Fatigue," [...] she remarked, [...] "sets itself <b>right</b> <b>with</b> rest. Did <b>you</b> take a very long walk?" ...|$|R
60|$|And now, having, as I hope, {{justified}} my {{assumption of}} a place among handicraftsmen, and put myself <b>right</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> as to my qualification, from practical knowledge, to speak about technical education, I will proceed to lay before you the results of my experience as a teacher of a handicraft, and tell you what sort of education I should think best adapted for a boy whom one {{wanted to make a}} professional anatomist.|$|E
6000|$|By {{the time}} he met March at the office next morning, a little, but only a very little, misgiving saddened his golden heaven. He took March's hand with high courage, and said, [...] "Well, the old man sticks to his point, March." [...] He added, {{with the sense of}} saying it before Miss Woodburn: [...] "And I stick by you. I've thought it all over, and I'd rather be <b>right</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> than wrong with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You cannot frighten me," [...] {{she assured}} him. [...] "Of course, {{you are a}} man--of a sort--and I am a woman, but I do not fancy that you would find, {{if it came to}} force, that you would have much of an advantage. However, we are {{wandering}} from the point. I claim an equal <b>right</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> to see anything which you may discover in Mr. Orden's papers. I might, indeed, if I chose, claim a prior right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{no wrong}} in what I do. <b>Right</b> is <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> M. de Luynes, and if I break faith with the might I serve, {{it is because}} that might is an unjust one; I do but betray the false to the true, and {{there can be little}} shame in such an act. Moreover, I have a reason--but let that be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{but that}} is not your fault, little one. I will make it all <b>right</b> <b>with</b> her, don't <b>you</b> fret. Come on, we had better go home and change it as soon as possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There isn't the {{slightest}} need for it," [...] he declared firmly. [...] "You {{go back and}} look after Felicia. Tell her we'll get Sidney out of this all <b>right.</b> Get away <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> Lane, now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "True?" [...] Rufus repeated, with stern contempt. [...] "What's come to you? Haven't I {{told you}} already, it's a lie? I'll answer to it, Amelius {{is true to}} you. Will that do? No? You're an obstinate one, Miss--that you are. Well! it's due to the boy that I should set him <b>right</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> if words will do it. You know how he's been brought up at Tadmor? Bear that in mind--and now you shall have the truth of it, on the word of an honest man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Didn't you lie me into it, {{if you let}} me fool myself, as you say?" [...] Stoller pursued, and Burnamy {{felt himself}} weaken through his wrath. [...] "Well, then, you got to lie me out of it. I been going over the damn thing, all night--and you can do it for me. I know you can do it," [...] he gave way in a plea that was almost a whimper. [...] "Look here! You see if you can't. I'll make it all <b>right</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> I'll pay you {{whatever}} you think is right--whatever you say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll be <b>right</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> my dear," [...] I answered, penitently; and, in fact, by {{the time}} the maid brought up the Haskeths' cards I was ready to go down. We {{certainly}} needed each other's support, and I do not know but we descended the stairs hand in hand, and entered the parlor leaning upon each other's shoulders. The Haskeths, who were much more deeply concerned, were not apparently so much moved. We shook hands with them, and then Mrs. Hasketh said to us in succession, [...] "My niece, Mrs. March; Mr. March, my niece." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Everything but tip me the wink,--everything but say, {{in so many}} words, 'You see I've made it all <b>right</b> <b>with</b> her: don't <b>you</b> {{wish you}} knew--how?'" [...] Halleck dropped his head, with a wrathful groan.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{certainly}} {{is unable to}} bear any exposure at present," [...] said the doctor, with an amused side glance at North's perplexed face. [...] "Miss Robinson is <b>right.</b> I'll ride <b>with</b> <b>you</b> over the sands {{as far as the}} trail." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then you'll {{certainly}} be sorry," [...] some one else broke in. [...] "We've had about enough trouble <b>right</b> along <b>with</b> <b>you</b> and we've come {{to hand in}} the bill. You headed us off a good trade, you brought the revenue folks in, and we mean to get even before we leave. Just now we'll be satisfied with your homestead, but that won't be enough after the next shot's fired." ...|$|R
