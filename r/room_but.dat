Newt Lee noticed that Frank was very agitated and asked if he could sleep in the packing <b>room,</b> <b>but</b> Frank was insistent that Lee leave the building and told Lee to go out {{and have a good time}} in town before coming back.|$|E
5|$|On March 25, 2005, the Pacers {{played at}} The Palace {{for the first}} time since the brawl. The game was delayed 90 minutes after a series of bomb threats were aimed at the Pacers locker <b>room,</b> <b>but</b> the game {{eventually}} started after no explosives were found. Two of the key figures in the original incident missed the game, as Artest was still suspended and O'Neal had an injured shoulder. In the game, the Pacers stopped the Pistons' twelve-game winning streak with a 94–81 win.|$|E
5|$|The Great Hall, {{leading off}} from the corridor, was the most {{important}} communal eating and living <b>room,</b> <b>but</b> by the time Montacute was completed the traditional Great Hall was largely an anachronism. Such halls continued to be built, however, albeit as at Montacute on a smaller scale. For the first few years after its completion, the servants continued to dine in the hall, but the family and honoured guests now ate in the Great Chamber above. The hall now served as a room to receive and also for processions to commence to the grander rooms above.|$|E

5|$|U-28 sank by {{accident}} on 17 March 1944, at the U-boat pier in Neustadt. During a training exercise, the boat had passed under a dummy freighter used for target practice. The commander-in-training failed {{to note the}} position of the stationary freighter, and the U-boat's conning tower was ripped off. Water flooded the control <b>room,</b> <b>but</b> the other compartments remained intact. The crew escaped by slowly equalizing the water pressure in the boat and swimming to the surface. The boat was raised in March 1944, but was stricken on 4 August. The submarine's crew suffered no casualties during her career.|$|E

5|$|A {{local radio}} show {{schedules}} {{an interview with}} Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) to discuss Dunder Mifflin, but, unbeknown to Dwight, the interview is later canceled. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) suggests they all use this to their advantage, and stage an interview for Dwight's benefit. Dwight believes he is talking to the interviewer through {{the phone in the}} break <b>room,</b> <b>but</b> is actually talking to Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) who is using an American accent. They convince him that the information he is giving leads to a hostage situation with CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) cornered in his house. Dwight calls David and tries to talk him into surrendering to the police. David is confused but nonetheless responds in a way that leads Dwight to believe he was successful. He emerges from the break room and is greeted by a round of applause from his coworkers.|$|E
5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the Wootton Hall is its pair of Italian black and Beschia marble blackamoor torchères, originally given to the First Duke of Marlborough as a present from General Charles Churchill. In exceptionally good condition, they stand {{either side of the}} door into the Saloon. These were discovered in the silt of the River Tiber and are depictions of slaves who once served in a Roman household. Several flags stand above them, including the White Ensign. The ceiling is intricately made, featuring flowers in the plaster, each one different, the work of Colen Campbell in the early 18th century. The black and white check marble floor is also a distinguishing {{feature of the}} <b>room,</b> <b>but</b> through most of its history this floor would have been left plain as horses and carriages would enter the hall inside. In the mid 19th century Frederick, the 4th Earl, had laid down brown and blue tiles, replaced by the marble floor which was added by his son Robert in around 1910. The floor gives significant depth to the hall and provides fine acoustics, so much that Diana would once practice her tap dancing in the hall as a teenager.|$|E

Her American movie star boyfriend (who was never mentioned until now) appears and starts to bark orders at him, as well as make unflattering comments about Anna's weight. Anna is apologetic and embarrassed, while a stunned Will leaves. Over the next six months, Max and Bella set Will up on a series of blind dates, trying to help him move on; however Will, still hung up on Anna, does not connect with any of them.|$|E

Bayliss (Kyle Secor) also tries to quit smoking, but tries to live {{vicariously}} through his smoking partner Pembleton (Andre Braugher). Howard and Bayliss petition Gee (Yaphet Kotto) {{to set up a}} non-smoking section for the squad <b>room,</b> <b>but</b> an amused Gee refuses because most of the detectives smoke.

Although outwardly critical and skeptical, Pembleton and Felton are actually impressed with their partners' willpower and discuss the merits of quitting smoking. Howard and Bayliss, however, talk about nothing but smoking, prompting Bayliss to walk to Pembleton's car window and ask for a cigarette. As the result, the four detectives almost miss the suspect, and have to engage him in a foot chase to arrest him.|$|E

5|$|The {{events of}} the Second Test also {{affected}} the career paths of other players.

However, there was certainly an altercation and Coxon was never selected again. The match was the last ever Test for Brown, who had struggled out of position in the middle-order, scoring 73 runs at 24.33 in three Test innings during the season. He had scored centuries on his previous Test outings at Lord's in 1934 and 1938, but the third visit {{proved to be the}} end of his international career.|$|E
