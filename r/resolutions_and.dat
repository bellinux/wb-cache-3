40|$|Abstract: The main {{purposes}} {{of the present study}} were first to examine the association between conflict <b>resolution</b> <b>and</b> marital satisfaction among married Iranian students in Malaysia and second to examine the degree to which gender role moderates the relationship between conflict <b>resolution</b> <b>and</b> marital satisfaction. Data from 387 participants were examined using measures of conflict <b>resolution</b> <b>and</b> marital satisfaction. The results indicated that conflict resolution is positively related to marital satisfaction. Although, based on gender role, there are some differences between conflict <b>resolution</b> <b>and</b> marital satisfaction; gender differences did not lead to the conclusion that gender has a moderating influence on the association between conflict <b>resolution</b> <b>and</b> marital satisfaction...|$|R

40|$|An {{exponential}} {{lower bound}} for the size of tree-like Cutting Planes refutations of a certain family of CNF formulas with polynomial size resolution refutations is proved. This implies an exponential separation between the tree-like versions and the dag-like versions of <b>resolution</b> <b>and</b> Cutting Planes. In both cases only superpolynomial separations were known [29, 18, 8]. In order to prove these separations, the lower bounds on the depth of monotone circuits of Raz and McKenzie in [25] are extended to monotone real circuits. An exponential separation is also proved between tree-like <b>resolution</b> <b>and</b> several refinements of resolution: negative <b>resolution</b> <b>and</b> regular <b>resolution.</b> Actually this last separation also provides a separation between tree-like <b>resolution</b> <b>and</b> ordered <b>resolution,</b> thus the corresponding superpolynomial separation of [29] is extended. Finally, an exponential separation between ordered <b>resolution</b> <b>and</b> unrestricted <b>resolution</b> (also negative resolution) is proved.

5|$|After the {{execution}} of the King in January 1649, England was declared a commonwealth and the Scots declared his son king as Charles II. The English responded with an invasion and, after defeats for the Scots at Dunbar in 1650 and Worcester in 1651, the English occupied the country in 1652, declaring Scotland part of the Commonwealth. In the period after the defeat at Dunbar the Kirk became deeply divided, partly in the search for scapegoats for defeat. Different factions and tendencies produced rival <b>resolutions</b> <b>and</b> protests, which gave their names to the two major parties as the Resolutioners, who were willing to make an accommodation with royalism, and the more hard line Protesters who wished to purge the Kirk of such associations. Subsequently, the divide between rival camps became almost irrevocable. After 1655 both groups appointed permanent agents in London.|$|E

A further complication {{is that there is a}} small amount of display equipment, such as some high-end home theater projectors, designed with HDMI inputs but not HDCP-compliant.|$|E
