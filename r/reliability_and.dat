They did, however, have the worst diving abilities of the three designs, and produced excessive exhaust smoke. To remedy the diving problems of the U-3-class, the fins were changed in size and shape several times. Eventually the front diving planes were removed and a stationary stern flap was affixed to the hull.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this paper}} is to report the inter-rater <b>reliabilities</b> <b>and</b> intra-rater reliabil-ities of the Clegg hammer, penetrometer, and studded-boot {{apparatus}} used for measuring the mechanical properties of natural turf, and to determine whether the level of experience influ-ences the <b>reliability.</b> Three experienced <b>and</b> three novice testers measured the surface hard-ness and rotational traction at nine locations on a community-level Australian football oval. A repeated-measures analysis of variance tested for significant differences between the six tes-ters for all equipment, and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to deter-mine the inter-rater <b>reliabilities</b> <b>and</b> intra-rater <b>reliabilities.</b> The ICCs for the reliability between the six testers ranged between 0. 77 and 0. 87 for the Clegg hammer, ranged between 0. 55 and 0. 73 for the penetrometer, and equalled 0. 51 for the studded-boot apparatus. The inter-rater <b>reliabilities</b> <b>and</b> intra-rater <b>reliabilities</b> were greater for the experienced testers than for the novice testers for the Clegg hammer and penetrometer but the novice testers produced greater inter-rater reliabilities for the studded-boot apparatus. This study highlights the potential variability that can exist between testers using the ground hardness and traction equipment, which has implications for future research involving multiple testers both in agronomic-based studies and in linking the surface properties to the injury risk across multi-ple venues...|$|R
