40|$|Client request {{rates for}} Internet {{services}} {{tend to be}} bursty and thus {{it is important to}} maintain efficient resource utilization under a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> conditions. Network service clients typically seek services interactively and maintaining reasonable response time is often imperative for such services. In addition, providing differentiated service qualities and resource allocation to multiple service classes can also be desirable at times. This paper presents an integrated resource management framework (part of Neptune system) that provides flexible service quality specification, efficient resource utilization, and service differentiation for cluster-based services. This framework introduces the metric of quality-aware service yield to combine the overall system efficiency and individual service response time in one flexible model. Resources are managed through a two-level request distribution and scheduling scheme. At the cluster level, a fully decentralized request distribution architecture is employed to achieve high scalability and availability. Inside each service node, an adaptive scheduling policy maintains efficient resource utilization under a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> conditions. Our trace-driven evaluations demonstrate the performance, scalability, and service differentiation achieved by the proposed techniques. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a load {{adaptive}} control method {{to improve the}} efficiency and dynamic performance of the Phase-Shifted Full-Bridge (PSFB) converter which works under a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> conditions is presented. The proposed control method {{can be used as}} a battery charger since this application demands a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> conditions. The composition of the PSFB converter’s losses and the loss analysis model are both discussed. According to this model, the optimum switching frequency which results in minimum power loss is adopted to improve the efficiency. The relationship between switching frequency and power loss is formulated over a wide load range. Indicated by this kind of relationship, the proposed controller adjusts the switching frequency at different load currents. Moreover, an adaptive gain adjustment controller is applied to replace the traditional controller, with the aim to improve the dynamic performance which is influenced by the changes of the switching frequency and load current. In addition, the experimental results show that the maximum improvement of efficiency is up to 20 %. These results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed load {{adaptive control}} method...|$|E
