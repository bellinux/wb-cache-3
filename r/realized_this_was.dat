25|$|Great Britain did {{not want}} war, in {{so much as it}} would be content if Russia would retreat from its war with the Ottomans without any {{territorial}} changes, but it <b>realized</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> an unlikely outcome. Starting in August 1790, British and Prussian diplomats in Russia started pressuring the Russians to begin negotiations with the Ottomans, with no luck.|$|E

25|$|The nearest {{fire station}} was just six blocks away. Firefighters were {{initially}} alerted {{by the force}} of the explosion buckling the fire station door. Originally it was thought that a car had struck the fire station, but when firefighters went outside, they quickly <b>realized</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> not the case. One of the drivers soon spotted smoke and a fire engine and a paramedic unit were dispatched to go to this smoke. These vehicles were the first rescuers on the scene and arrived just three minutes, forty seconds after the initial explosion. They immediately sent for the department's heavy urban rescue team. Ultimately, 125 firefighters in 34 vehicles, 52 police officers, multiple private ambulances and the American Red Cross all helped at the scene, which was classed by the fire service as a five-alarm emergency.|$|E
500|$|... "No Exit" [...] was {{originally}} given the working title [...] "Three-Eyed Turtle", which was changed when {{an executive at}} the National Broadcasting Company (NBC)'s Standards and Practices office <b>realized</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> slang for a sexual act. The amended title, [...] "No Exit", has been seen by critics Stephen Sanders and Aeon Scoble as a reference to Jean-Paul Sartre's 1944 play No Exit, as the episode features [...] "an early series engagement with existentialism". The pair {{have argued that the}} fractured relationship between Tony and Rita Amato echoes the philosopher's assertion that all human relationships are defined by a struggle for control and supremacy.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{production budget}} {{was set at}} $25 million, but rose to $40 million. This happened after Disney became impressed with the dailies; [...] "they <b>realized</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a bigger movie than they were anticipating", Johnston explained, [...] "and they approved overages. It never got completely out of control." [...] An abandoned World War II runway at the Santa Maria, California airport set the scene for the fictional Chaplin Air Field. Additional scenes were shot at Bakersfield. For the air circus scene, 700 Santa Maria extras and 25 vintage aircraft were employed. Aerial coordinator Craig Hosking remarked in an interview, [...] "What makes The Rocketeer so unique was having several one-of-a-kind planes that hadn't flown in years," [...] including a 1916 Standard biplane and a Gee Bee Model Z racer. The sequence where Cliff rescues Malcolm was adapted shot-for-shot from Stevens' comic book.|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2000, Stevens was offered the {{opportunity}} to volunteer in the Butler basketball office. He ran the idea of quitting his job at Eli Lilly by then-longtime girlfriend Tracy Wilhelmy. She {{thought about it for}} two hours before telling him to go for it. [...] "Now, it looks like a great idea," [...] Stevens later remarked. [...] "At the time, I thought it was something I really wanted to try." [...] Tracy went back to school to get a law degree that could support the couple if things did not work out for Brad. [...] "We were 23 and <b>realized</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> our chance," [...] Tracy later said. [...] "Five years down the road, we were probably {{not going to be in}} a position to do that. The more success you had at Lilly, the harder it would be to leave." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{regards to}} Cyrus' songs, Chelsom said, [...] "We <b>realized</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> an {{opportunity}} {{to move forward with}} the music, to update it and make it more sophisticated, to move with Miley’s age. I’ve never had a better musical experience on any film." [...] Cyrus noted that most of the songs included on the soundtrack were inspired by the return of Cyrus' character, Miley Stewart/Hannah Montana, to her [...] Nashville roots. She explained, [...] "The soundtrack is all about Nashville, and that's where I'm from, that's my roots. I think that's a lot of the reason I am who I am." [...] Cyrus co-wrote [...] "Don't Walk Away" [...] because it was to be included on her own studio album Breakout (2008). [...] "Hoedown Throwdown", a song in which Cyrus calls dance steps, took much time to write. It became an ongoing collaboration between Chelsom, Cyrus, choreographer Jamal Sims, and the song's writers, Adam Anders and Nikki Hasman.|$|E
500|$|Tucci {{was one of}} {{the last}} actors cast; he agreed to play Nigel only three days before {{shooting}} started. The filmmakers reportedly had auditioned Barney's creative director Simon Doonan and E!'s Robert Verdi, both openly gay men highly visible as media fashion commentators, for the part; the BBC's Graham Norton also auditioned. Verdi would later claim there was no intention to actually hire him and the producers had just used him and Doonan to give whoever they ultimately did cast some filmed research to use in playing a gay character (he would end up with a walk-on part as a fashion journalist in Paris). Tucci claims he was unaware of this: [...] "All I know is that someone called me and I <b>realized</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a great part." [...] He based the character on various people he was acquainted with, insisting on the glasses he ultimately wore. Daniel Sunjata had originally read for Tucci's part, rather unenthusiastically since he had just finished playing a similar character, but then read the Holt part and asked if he could audition for it. Simon Baker auditioned by sending a video of himself, wearing the same self-designed green jacket he has on when he and Andrea meet for the first time.|$|E

500|$|Parker and Stone {{were unhappy}} with the turkey attack subplot, which they felt [...] "never really went anywhere" [...] and ended {{abruptly}} without any satisfying conclusion. They nevertheless included it because they felt obligated to include a B story, since every episode in the season so far had included one. Later in the series, they said they <b>realized</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> not necessary and made many episodes without a B story. Although the duo liked the [...] "payoff" [...] of the Starvin' Marvin main plot, {{they did not know}} how to end the turkey subplot, so they simply had the characters kill all the turkeys and claim that there were none left; they decided this sudden ending was the funniest possible option. Stone said of the subplot, [...] "The turkeys were just an excuse to have the Braveheart sequence." [...] The animators enjoyed creating the turkey battle scene, which was designed to be shown in widescreen aspect ratio while the rest of the episode was animated normally. However, the animation proved to be very difficult and took a long time to do because it involved a larger number of characters and animals in one scene than had ever been featured previously in the show. Some of the characters in the far background were animated as gray and shadowy, which Parker said was not so much a visual effect as it was a [...] "lighting effect meaning we didn't want to draw all these people".|$|E
500|$|Stanton wanted WALL-E to be {{a box and}} EVE to be like an egg. WALL-E's {{eyes were}} {{inspired}} {{by a pair of}} binoculars Stanton was given when watching the Oakland Athletics play against the Boston Red Sox. He [...] "missed the entire inning" [...] because he was distracted by them. The director was reminded of Buster Keaton and decided the robot would not need a nose or mouth. Stanton added a zoom lens to make WALL-E more sympathetic. Ralph Eggleston noted this feature gave the animators more to work with and gave the robot a childlike quality. Pixar's studies of trash compactors during their visits to recycling stations inspired his body. His tank treads were inspired by a wheelchair someone had developed that used treads instead of wheels. The animators wanted him to have elbows, but <b>realized</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> unrealistic because he is only designed to pull garbage into his body. His arms also looked flimsy when they did a test of him waving. Animation director Angus MacLane suggested they attach his arms to a track on the sides of his body to move them around, based on the inkjet printers his father designed. This arm design contributed to creating the character's posture, so if they wanted him to be nervous, they would lower them. Stanton was unaware of the similarities between WALL-E and Johnny 5 from Short Circuit until others pointed it out to him.|$|E
2500|$|Finally the Coca-Cola board {{changed their}} minds and decided {{to bring back the}} old Coke. Company {{president}} Donald Keough revealed years later, in the documentary The People vs. Coke (2002), that they <b>realized</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the only right thing to do when they visited a small restaurant in Monaco and the owner of the restaurant proudly said they had [...] "the real thing, it's a real Coke," [...] offering them a chilled 6 and 1/2 oz. glass bottle of original Coca-Cola.|$|E

Using her celebrity as a former model, she brings in clients and tries to bring some order to a business previously run without any discipline. By the time he had written 50 pages for the pilot to the show, Caron says he realized he was writing the part for Cybill Shepherd. After reading the script, she immediately <b>realized</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a part she wanted to do and, during her first meeting with Caron and producer Jay Daniel, remarked that it was reminiscent of a “Hawksian” comedy. [...] The two had no idea what she was talking about, so she suggested they screen Twentieth Century, Bringing Up Baby, and His Girl Friday, three of her favorites, to see how the overlapping dialogue was handled. [...] A week before shooting of the pilot began, Caron, Shepherd, and Willis watched Bringing Up Baby and His Girl Friday.|$|E
