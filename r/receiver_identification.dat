40|$|The {{efficacy}} of any animal signal is {{constrained by the}} range over which it remains above the sensory threshold of potential receivers. The spatial area in which reliable detection occurs defines active space; this is influenced by signal structure, the signalling environment and the sensory characteristics of <b>receivers.</b> <b>Identification</b> of the factors influencing active space has provided valuable insights into signal design, particularly in bioacoustics, in which signal distortion and degradation can be easily quantified. In the present study, we consider whether active space can similarly help to explain {{the design of a}} movement-based visual signal. The Jacky dragon (Amphibolurus muricatus) threat display is composed of five distinct motor patterns delivered in an obligatory sequence: tail-flicks, backward and forward foreleg waves, a push-up and a 'body-rock'. In contrast to other communication systems, the introductory element is characterized by reduced intensity (average speed) but greater duration than subsequent motor patterns. Furthermore, the tail-flick sweeps a three-dimensional (3 D) space around the lizard, whereas the motor patterns that follow are largely restricted to a single plane. Structural properties thus suggest that the active space of the tail-flick might be greater than that of the other motor patterns in the display, which would provide a parsimonious explanation for its use as an alerting component. We tested this prediction in a playback experiment incorporating 3 D animations of lizard displays, comparing response probabilities to the factorial combination of three motor patterns, three viewing angles and three distances. Results suggest that the tail-flick does not have a greater active space than other display motor patterns, but that each degrades predictably with distance, thereby providing potential ranging cues. In addition, display components are remarkably robust to variation in receiver orientation, so that efficacy should be maximized in most potential signalling situations. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that duration is the principal determinant of signal efficacy in this system. 8 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{sidelobe}} contamination of bistatic apparent Doppler velocity measurements {{involved in a}} bistatic Doppler radar network is examined. So far {{in the context of}} 3 D wind field analysis, by combining a traditional Doppler radar with one or more bistatic <b>receivers,</b> <b>identification</b> and hence removal of regions of high degrees of contamination were necessarily crucial steps to obtaining reliable wind fields. This study proposes an alternative solution to the forced rejection of bistatic Doppler data suspected to be contaminated by sidelobe echoes, on the basis of restoring the nonmeasured “actual” (i. e., noncontaminated) bistatic Doppler velocity from both monostatic radar and bistatic receiver measurements. The correction method is based on a modeled expression of the observed bistatic apparent Doppler velocity defined as the reflectivity-weighted average of actual Doppler velocity of particles within individual volume samples, including the antenna gain pattern of both transmitting and receiving radars. The searched actual Doppler velocity is a solution of an underdetermined inverse problem that can be handled as a constrained linear inversion problem, through a variational least squares analysis method. The performances of the proposed method are analyzed, using simulated radar observations involving one remote receiver. An example of application to experimental data collected by the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft und Raumfahrt (DLR) bistatic Doppler radar network within a moderate precipitation system observed on 8 May 2000 in Germany is also presented. Pseudo-Doppler observations of a tropical squall-line system are used to quantify the effective improvement of the correction method on the bistatic Doppler velocity and hence the retrieved 3 D wind field. Statistics of the differences are presented between observed and idealized (sidelobe free) velocity structures on the one hand, and corrected and idealized velocity structures on the other hand. Clearly shown is the very low level of the corrected minus idealized differences (mean and standard deviation) against the significantly high level of the observed minus idealized differences. As previously observed, maximum correction occurs in regions of potentially high gradients of reflectivity. It is also found that regions of low observed minus idealized differences remain unchanged after correction, which means that the sidelobe-correction method only acts on needed regions and does not introduce any artificial modification...|$|R

Ultra-wide bandwidths of mmWave signals and the possibility of utilizing large number of antennas at the transmitter and the <b>receiver</b> allow accurate <b>identification</b> of multipath components in temporal and angular domains, making mmWave systems advantageous for localization applications. In this paper, we analyze the performance of a two-step mmWave localization approach that can utilize time-of-arrival, angle-of-arrival, and angle-of-departure from multiple nodes in an urban environment with both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) links. Networks with/without radio-environmental mapping (REM) are considered, where a network with REM is able to localize nearby scatterers. Estimation of a UE location is challenging due to large numbers of local optima in the likelihood function. To address this problem, a gradient-assisted particle filter (GAPF) estimator is proposed to accurately estimate a user equipment (UE) location as well as the locations of nearby scatterers. Monte-Carlo simulations show that the GAPF estimator performance matches the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). The estimator is also used to create a REM. It is seen that significant localization gains can be achieved by increasing beam directionality or by utilizing REM.|$|R

In particular, the receiver consists of a symbol-by-symbol maximum a posteriori (SbS-MAP) detector that feeds a nonlinear Kalman-like channel estimator with the soft statistics constituted by the a posteriori probabilities (APPs) of the state sequence of the ISI channel. Several numerical results confirm that the proposed blind detector achieves the identification of nonminimum phase channels with deep spectral notches within 300 symbols, even at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Furthermore, an attractive feature of the proposed blind channel estimator is that it directly estimates the discrete-time impulse response of the unknown channel so that, in principle, any equalization technique for known channels may be performed after channel identification has been achieved...|$|R

A project provided the means for the acquisition of precision farming technologies and demonstration of their potential and limitations in experiments carried out on a 6 ha field with a biodiverse pasture.

40|$|In {{addition}} to its intrinsic interest, Mars is particularly well-suited for studying {{the full range of}} processes and phenomena related to early terrestrial planet evolution, from initial differentiation to the start of plate tectonics. It is large and complex enough to have undergone most of the processes that affected early Earth but, unlike the Earth, has apparently not undergone extensive plate tectonics or other major reworking that erased the imprint of early events (as evidenced by the presence of cratered surfaces older than 4 Ga). The martian mantle should have Earth-like polymorphic phase transitions and may even support a perovskite layer near the core (depending on the actual core radius), a characteristic that would have major implications for core cooling and mantle convection. Thus even the most basic measurements of planetary structure, such as crustal thickness, core radius and state (solid/liquid), and gross mantle velocity structure would provide invaluable constraints on models of early planetary evolution. Despite this strong scientific motivation (and several failed attempts), Mars remains terra incognita from a seismic standpoint. This is due to an unfortunate convergence of circumstances, prominent among which are our uncertainty in the level of seismic activity and the relatively high cost of landing multiple long-lived spacecraft on Mars to comprise a seismic network for body-wave travel-time analysis; typically four to ten stations are considered necessary for this type of experiment. In this presentation I will address both of these issues. In order to overcome the concern about a possible lack of marsquakes with which to work, it is useful to identify alternative methods for using seismic techniques to probe the interior. Seismology without quakes can be accomplished in a number of ways. “Unconventional” sources of seismic energy include meteorites (which strike the surface of Mars at a relatively high rate), artificial projectiles (which can supply up to 1010 J of kinetic energy), seismic “hum” from meteorological forcing, and tidal deformation from Phobos (with a period around 6 hours). Another means for encouraging a seismic mission to Mars is to promote methods that can derive interior information from a single seismometer. Fortunately many such methods exist, including source location through P-S and back-azimuth, <b>receiver</b> functions, <b>identification</b> of later phases (PcP, PKP, etc.), surface wave dispersion, and normal mode analysis (from single large events, stacked events, or background noise). Such methods could enable the first successful seismic investigation of another planet since the Apollo seismometers were turned off almost 35 years ago...|$|R
40|$|Seamless {{pedestrian}} navigation in both {{indoor and}} outdoor environments is an unsolved challenge today. Though various navigation systems and sensors exist which are suitable in terms of size, cost, and power consumption, today none of these systems is expected {{to serve as a}} sole means for personal navigation in the mid-term future. In particular the characteristic drawbacks of today’s systems in specific environments prevent their successful use. This work shows how to solve the problem by the rigorous application of a sound theoretically motivated approach: The combination of various sensors and the optimal joint processing of their provided data by a Bayesian filter algorithm, which optimally takes into account the uncertainty inherently included in each sensor’s data and which exploits optimally all available knowledge about the movement of the navigating individual, such that in the end no information is lost during the processing of the data. After an introduction to personal navigation systems and sensors, particularly focusing on satellite and inertial navigation, and a summary on the concept and the implementation of Bayesian filters, the thesis addresses the application of Bayesian filtering to enhance the performance of satellite navigation receivers in urban multipath environments. The results confirm the benefit of the Bayesian approach, which is shown to outperform a conventional navigation receiver significantly. Subsequently a novel integration scheme for inertial sensors is proposed based on the concept of foot-mounted inertial sensing. Thereby particular emphasis is put on the incorporation of an adequate map-based pedestrian mobility model {{in order to reduce the}} heavy drift of today’s small-scale and low-cost micro-electro-mechanical inertial sensor platforms. The results show that the combination of inertial navigation with a map-based pedestrian mobility model can achieve a fully autonomous drift-free navigation in indoor environments. Finally it is shown how seamless pedestrian navigation systems can be designed successfully by the use of Bayesian filtering algorithms. The design of the filter algorithms is addressed and depending on the employed and available sensors the suitable filter implementation is chosen, including an extended Kalman filter for the combination of fingerprinting via a wireless local area network and foot-mounted inertial sensors and a particle filter for the integration of a satellite navigation <b>receiver,</b> a radio-frequency <b>identification</b> unit, a compass, a baro-altimeter, a foot-mounted inertial platform, and a map-based pedestrian mobility model...|$|R
40|$|Supporting the {{expected}} high data rates required by wireless Internet and high-speed multimedia services {{is one of}} the basic requirements in broadband mobile wireless systems. However, the achievable capacity and data rate of wireless communication systems are limited by the time-varying nature of the channel. Efficient techniques for combating the time-varying effects of wireless channels can be achieved by utilizing different forms of diversity. In recent years, transmit diversity based on space-time coding (STC) has received more attention as an effective technique for combating fading. On the other hand, most existing space-time diversity techniques have been developed for flat-fading channels. Given the fact that wireless channels are generally frequency-selective, in this thesis, we aim to investigate the performance of space-time diversity schemes for wideband code-division multiple-access (WCDMA) systems over frequency-selective fading channels. The proposed receiver in this case is a rake-type receiver, which exploits the path diversity inherent to multipath propagation. Then, a decorrelator detector is used to mitigate the multiple access interference (MAI) and the known near-far problem. We derive the bit error rate (BER) expression over frequency-selective fading channels considering both the fast and slow fading cases. Finally, we show that our proposed receiver achieves the full system diversity through simulation and analytical results. Most of the work conducted in this area considers perfect knowledge of the channel at the <b>receiver.</b> Hence, channel <b>identification</b> brings significant challenges to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) CDMA systems. In light of this, we propose a channel estimation and data detection scheme based on the superimposed training-based approach. The proposed scheme enhances the performance by eliminating the MAI from both the channel and data estimates by employing two decorrelators; channel and data decorrelators. The performance of the proposed estimation technique is investigated over frequency-selective slow fading channels where we derived a closed-form expression for the BER {{as a function of the}} number of users, K, the number resolvable paths, L, and the number of receive antennas, V. Finally, our proposed scheme is shown to be more robust to channel estimation errors. Furthermore, both the analytical and simulation results indicate that the full system diversity is achieved. Considering that training estimation techniques suffer either from low spectral efficiency (i. e., conventional training approach) or from high pilot power consumption (i. e., superimposed training-based approach), in the last part of the thesis, we present an iterative joint detection and estimation (JDE) using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for MIMO CDMA systems over frequency-selective fading channels. We also derive a closed-form expression for the optimized weight coefficients of the EM algorithm, which was shown to provide significant performance enhancement relative to the conventional equal-weight EM-based signal decomposition. Finally, our simulation results illustrate that the proposed receiver achieves near-optimum performance with modest complexity using very few training symbols...|$|R
