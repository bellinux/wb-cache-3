25|$|On 5 October 1992, the Board of Governors of the Bundesbahn and the Reichsbahn {{determined}} {{the route of}} the new line. The spatial planning procedure was launched on 20October 1992. The Free State of Bavaria gave its opinion on the 1March 1993. It confirmed the compatibility of two options with the goals of land planning. The essential requirements were an ICE stop in Coburg, the replacement of embankments by bridges in ecologically sensitive areas, the relocation of the planned over-taking station in Dorfles-Esbach to the south and the lowest possible crossing of the Main valley to the north of Ebensfeld. An option, which involved a route through Coburg, was abandoned in this context. In its opinion of 20 April 1993, the State of Thuringia sought, among others, an Interregio stop in the Ilmenau area, a shift of the line in the Gehren / Gräfinau-Angstedt area to the west, a western bypass of Molsdorf to protect the drinking water catchment area of Erfurt and the bundling of the route with the A71 autobahn between Erfurt and Ilmenau. The planning approval procedure (as of mid-1994) would be carried out jointly in accordance with the <b>railway</b> <b>law</b> for both routes in this section.|$|E
500|$|Credit Suisse's founder, Alfred Escher, was called, [...] "the spiritual {{father of}} the <b>railway</b> <b>law</b> of 1852," [...] for his work {{defeating}} {{the idea of a}} state-run railway system in Switzerland in favor of privatization. Escher founded Credit Suisse (originally called the Swiss Credit Institution, i.e., Schweizerische Kreditanstalt) jointly with jointly with Allgemeine Deutsche Credit-Anstalt in 1856 primarily to provide domestic funding to railway projects, avoiding French banks that wanted to exert influence over the railway system. Escher aimed to start the company with three million shares and instead sold 218 million shares in three days. The bank was modeled after Crédit Mobilier, a bank funding railway projects in France that was founded two years prior, except Credit Suisse had a more conservative lending policy focused on short-to-medium term loans. In its first year of operation, 25 percent of the bank's revenues was from the Swiss Northeastern Railway, which was being built by Escher's company, Nordostbahn.|$|E

The law was abolished on April 1, 1987, and as a result, Tokyo DisneySea could add railways useful as transportation within the park without falling under the local <b>railway</b> <b>laws.</b>|$|R

50|$|The French rail policy, {{once put}} in place, had its deficiencies, but one {{certainly}} cannot {{consider it a}} failure, and other powers attempting to encourage rail developments adopted {{many aspects of the}} French <b>railway</b> <b>laws.</b> The bureaucratisation and influence of special interests associated with all governments, even those of corporations, also negatively affected the French railways. However, the French rail system had failed to grow on its own and required government intervention to expand successfully. While the alleged intrusion of government into the railway sector caused problems, it also proved necessary and inevitable.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The main {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to analyse the influence of the actuator’s law of motion on the railroad cars motion when these last are moved by a wire. The first results show that, during the start and stop transients, the moment versus time law (hence the shape of the law of motion given by the winch) significantly affects the railroad cars motion. This suggests that, by means of a suitable actuator’s law of motion, the railroad cars oscillations occurring during the start and stop transients can be possible significantly reduced.

2500|$|The Vietnamese {{railway network}} is owned and {{operated}} by the state-owned enterprise Vietnam Railways (VNR), which operates a number of different subsidiaries involved in construction, communications, training, and other activities connected to railway maintenance. Following the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, the newly reunified Vietnamese railway network was centrally managed by the precursor of VNR, the government's Department of Railways. Initially, low rail tariffs and the poor state of infrastructure used in other modes of transport led to high usage, but revenue proved to be insufficient to cover the railway's operating costs. In 1986, the Government's implementation of Doi Moi economic reforms led to the deregulation of the transport sector and the shift towards a market-led economy, forcing the railways to change in order to maintain a competitive edge. The Department of Railways was reorganized into Vietnam Railways (...) in 1989; since that time, railway reform has passed through a number of stages. Responsibility for rail infrastructure and operations were separated by government decree in 1994. The government of Germany began providing assistance with the restructuring of the railway sector in 2000, allowing VNR to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its operations, thus increasing its competitiveness. In 2003, VNR was re-organized as a state corporation, the Vietnam Railway Corporation, operating in railway transport and related services; railway administration and infrastructure management were given to the Vietnam Railway Administration, under the authority of the Ministry of Transport. A <b>Railway</b> <b>Law</b> was passed by the National Assembly on 19 May 2005; although regulations for the law's implementation have yet to be issued, it does provide a strong basis for further sector development; among other things, it proposed that foreign investors be invited to invest in Vietnam Railways.|$|E
