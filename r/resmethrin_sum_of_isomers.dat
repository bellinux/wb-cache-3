Compared with previously reported studies, concentrations of OCPs in these regions were {{much lower than the}} levels in the last decades. The ratio of alpha:gamma HCH was 5. 0 and 3. 4 for the Bering and Chukchi sea, respectively, which indicated the different pesticide composition in these two regions. Many other OCPs with different residue patterns were also found {{for the first time in}} the investigation regions.

In order to accommodate the intended uses of prothioconazole, France proposed to raise the existing MRLs from the value of 0. 1 mg/kg for rape seed and 0. 05 mg/kg for the other three oilseeds to 0. 15 mg/kg for these four oilseeds. France drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA.

40|$|The {{numerical}} simulation of practical combustion {{devices such as}} {{engines and gas turbines}} requires the coupling of descriptions of complex physical flows with complex chemistry in order to accurately predict phenomena such as ignition and flame propagation. For three-dimensional simulations, this becomes computationally challenging where interactions between large numbers of chemical species are involved. Historically therefore, such simulations used highly simplified descriptions of chemistry, which limited the applicability of the models. More recently, however, a range of techniques for reducing the size of chemical schemes have been developed, where the resulting reduced schemes can be shown to have accuracies which are almost as good as much larger comprehensive mechanisms. Such techniques will be described in this chapter. Skeletal reduction techniques are first introduced which aim to identify redundant species and reactions within a mechanism over wide ranges of conditions. Approaches based on sensitivity analysis, optimization and direct relation graphs are introduced. Lumping techniques are then discussed which exploit similarities between the structure and reactivity of species in describing lumped components, which can represent the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> several <b>isomers</b> <b>of</b> a particular hydrocarbon species for example. Both approaches can lead to a substantial reduction in the size of chemical mechanisms (numbers of species and reactions) without having a significant impact on model accuracy. They are combined in the chemistry-guided reduction approach, which is shown to generate reduced chemical schemes which are small enough be used within simulations of ignition behaviour in a homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine...|$|R

The observed ratio of toluene to benzene (2. 9 [*]±[*] 1. 8) reflected the small fraction of vehicles with catalytic converters in the Kathamndu. Analysis of the late afternoon time series of aromatics, NO x, and wind data indicated that road traffic {{was one of the main}} sources of aromatics in the urban air. In addition, the correlations between aromatics, SO 2, NO x, and PM 10 during the night strongly suggested that fossil and biomass fuel burning made an important contribution to air pollution in the Kathmandu valley. Aromatic pollution was further strengthened by daily recurring stable meteorological conditions and the surrounding topography.

This {{study examined the}} effects of feeding pasture vs. concentrate on the distribution <b>of</b> CLA <b>isomers</b> in the lipids of longissimus and semitendinosus muscle, liver and heart muscle, and subcutaneous fat in beef bulls. Sixty-four German Holstein and German Simmental bulls were randomly allocated to either an indoor concentrate system or periods of pasture feeding followed by a finishing period on a concentrate containing linseed to enhance their beef content of n? 3 PUFA and CLA. The concentrations <b>of</b> CLA <b>isomers</b> in the different tissues were determined by GC and silver ion HPLC. The diet affected the distribution <b>of</b> individual CLA <b>isomers</b> in the lipids of the different tissues. The concentration (mg/ 100 g fresh tissue) of the most prominent isomer, cis- 9,trans- 11 18 ? 2, was increased up to 1. 5 times in liver and heart tissue of bulls fed on pasture as compared with concentrate. However, no diet effect was observed for cis- 9,trans- 11 18 ? 2 in the lipids of longissimus muscle and subcutaneous fat. In all tissues, the second-most abundant CLA isomer in concentratefed bulls was trans- 7,cis- 9 18 ? 2. In contrast, trans- 11,cis- 13 18 ? 2 was the second-most abundant CLA isomer in all investigated tissue lipids of pasture-fed bulls. The concentration of the trans- 11,cis- 13 18 ? 2 isomer was up to 15 times higher in tissues of pasture-fed bulls as compared with concentrate-fed animals. Furthermone, diet affected the concentrations of the CLA trans,trans 18 ? 2 isomers. Pasture feeding significantly increased the concentrations of some trans,trans 18 ? 2 isomers as compared with concentrate, predominantly trans- 12,trans- 14 18 ? 2 and trans- 11,trans- 13 18 ? 2.

Upon stopping contraception, subjects provided daily urine specimens and records of vaginal bleeding for up to 1 year or until clinical pregnancy. Daily urinary human chorionic gonadotropin was assayed to detect conception and early pregnancy losses, and pregnancies were followed to detect clinical spontaneous abortions. There were 128 (26 %) early pregnancy losses in 500 con-ceptions and 36 (10 %) spontaneous abortions in 372 clinical pregnancies. Subjects were grouped in tertiles by preconception serum total DDT concentration (group 1 : 5. 5 – 22. 9 ng/g; group 2 : 23. 0 – 36. 5 ng/g; group 3 : 36. 6 – 113. 3 ng/g).

40|$|Comunicação Oral. Congresso Nacional. Instituto Politécnico de Beja, Escola Superior Agrária de BejaThe {{perception}} {{of quality and}} "healththiness" of food {{has become the most}} important factor for decision. ln meat, this aspect is largely related to its fat content and fatty acid composition. Some meat fatty acids play important roles in metabolism and human health. Recent interest in a minor group of fatty acids that are characteristic of ruminant fat, named conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), is also of great nutritional and bíological consideration. One of the major concerns with the existing technologies for food preservation, including irradiation, is that these processes may enhance lipid oxidation and thereby affect meat qualíty. There are attempts to enforce irradition not only for food safety, but also for technological purposes. Even though irradiation is a prospective	technology, its application causes physical-chemical and biochemical changes, that may affect nutritional value and sensory characteristics of irradiated food. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of gamma irradiation on fatty acid composition and contents <b>of</b> CLA <b>isomers</b> in frosen lamb meat. The major fatty acids were 18 : 1 c 9 as monounsaturated, 16 : 0 and 18 : 0 as saturated and 18 : 2 n- 6 as polyunsaturated fatty acids. No significant differences were observed in fatty acid composition between non-irradiated and irradiated meat samples. The CLA isomeric distribution showed a clear predominance of the c 9,t 11,c 13. 18 : 2 (10. 3 and 10. 1 %) and t 7,c 9 - 18 : 2 (2. 91 and 2. 94 %). It was found that the irradiation treatment, in contrast to the percentages <b>of</b> partial <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> CLA <b>isomers</b> (trans, trans, cis/trans and cis, cis), which showed significant differences (p< 0. 001), had no effect on the relative proportions <b>of</b> individual CLA <b>isomers</b> (except for the minor t 11,t 13. 18 : 2 and t 9,t 11 - 18 : 2). In addition, and regarding the health-promoting CLA isomers (c 9 t 11 - 18 : 2 and t 10 c 12 - 18 : 2), the irradiation process does not negatively alter the composition and nutritional value of lamb meatAGRO/ 2003 / 512, CIISA/ 2002 / 5...|$|R

The aim of this work was to study the kinetics of milk FA during rapid or progressive transition from hay- to pasture-based diets. Two farms in the southwestern Alps were selected. The milk of five Valdostana Red Pie cows from each farm was analysed on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 (at day 1, pasture was introduced into the diet), and thereafter twice a week. Changes in the milk FA became significant after days 3 or 5. The FA from C 4 : 0 to C 18 : 0, C 18 : 2 - 6, C 18 : 3 - 3 and C 20 : 0 became stable after day 5 for both transition types. The 9 -C 18 : 1, 10 + 11 -C 18 : 1 and 911 -conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) became stable 3, 16 and 16 days after the maximum pasture intake, respectively. The C 4 : 0 peaked at 3 days after pasture introduction or increase in the diet, probably reflecting high butyrate production in the rumen due to the high carbohydrate concentration in fresh herbage. The kinetics of all FAs fitted a log-normal cumulate distribution (except for C 4 : 0), but model coefficients did not differ between the rapid and the progressive transition.

Conventional techniques like soxhlet, ASE, GPC, sulphuric acid digestion, and acidified silica SPE are generally used in sample pre-treatment while detection is mostly performed by LC–MSMS. A combined analysis of HBCD and TBBPA is problematic due to the hydroxyl groups in the TBBPA molecule. However, using a specific mesh-size sodium sulphate in ASE extraction and an acid silica column combined with a Sep-pack Plus silica cartridge for purification resulted in recoveries between 80 % and 110 % for all compounds.

The present study demonstrates the resolution <b>of</b> <b>isomers</b> using alpha/beta-cyclodextrin as a co-solute by Matrix Assisted Diffusion Ordered Spectroscopy. The resolution <b>of</b> <b>isomers</b> has been achieved by measuring the {{significant differences in the}} diffusion rates between the positional <b>isomers</b> <b>of</b> aminobenzoic acids, benzenedicarboxylic acids and between the cis, trans isomers, fumaric acid and maleic acid.

40|$|The photophysical {{properties}} of the zinc(II) derivatives <b>of</b> five <b>isomers</b> <b>of</b> dinitrotetraphenylporphyrin were investigated in seven different solvents of varying polarity. The red shift of the optical absorption band and the enhanced oscillator strength of the Q(0, 0) transition are highly specific of the nature <b>of</b> the <b>isomers.</b> The solvatochromic effect on the emission data <b>of</b> the <b>isomers</b> reveals large structural changes on excitation. The excited state geometries <b>of</b> the <b>isomers</b> involve the partial rotation of the nitro groups about {{the plane of the}} porphyrin. The multiexponential decay of the excited singlet state <b>of</b> these <b>isomers</b> suggests a broad angular distribution of the emitting state. The magnitude of the excited state dipole moment and the low value of the transition moment <b>of</b> the <b>isomers</b> point to the possible existence of twisted intramolecular charge transfer in the excited singlet state...|$|R
40|$|Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are ozone-depleting {{substances}} {{as well as}} strong greenhouse gases, and the control of their production and use under the Montreal Protocol has had demonstrable benefits to both mitigation of increasing surface UV radiation and climate forcing. A global ban on consumption came into force in 2010, but {{there is evidence of}} continuing emissions of certain CFCs from a range of sources. One compound has received little attention in the literature, namely CFC- 114 (C 2 Cl 2 F 4). Of particular interest here is the differentiation between CFC- 114 (CClF 2 CClF 2) and its asymmetric isomeric form CFC- 114 a (CF 3 CCl 2 F) as atmospheric long-term measurements in the peer-reviewed literature to date have been assumed to represent the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> both <b>isomers</b> with a time-invariant isomeric speciation. Here we report the first long-term measurements of the two isomeric forms separately, and find that they have different origins and trends in the atmosphere. Air samples collected at Cape Grim (41 ° S), Australia, during atmospheric background conditions since 1978, combined with samples collected from deep polar snow (firn) enable us to obtain a near-complete record of both gases since their initial production and release in the 1940 s. Both isomers were present in the unpolluted atmosphere in comparably small amounts before 1960. The mixing ratio of CFC- 114 doubled from 7. 9 to 14. 8 parts per trillion (ppt) between the start of the Cape Grim record in 1978 and the end of our record in 2014, while over the same time CFC- 114 a trebled from 0. 35 to 1. 03  ppt. Mixing ratios <b>of</b> both <b>isomers</b> are slowly decreasing {{by the end of this}} period. This is consistent with measurements of recent aircraft-based samples showing no significant interhemispheric mixing ratio gradient. We also find that the fraction of CFC- 114 a mixing ratio relative to that of CFC- 114 increased from 4. 2 to 6. 9  % over the 37 -year period. This contradicts the current tacit assumption used in international climate change and ozone depletion assessments that both isomers have been largely co-emitted and that their atmospheric concentration ratio has remained approximately constant in time. Complementary observations of air collected in Taiwan indicate a persisting source of CFC- 114 a in South East Asia which may have been contributing to the changing balance between the two isomers. In addition we present top-down global annual emission estimates of CFC- 114 and CFC- 114 a derived from these measurements using a two-dimensional atmospheric chemistry-transport model. In general, the emissions for both compounds grew steadily during the 1980 s, followed by a substantial reduction from the late 1980 s onwards, which is consistent with the reduction of emission in response to the Montreal Protocol, and broadly consistent with bottom-up estimates derived by industry. However, we find that small but significant emissions <b>of</b> both <b>isomers</b> remain in 2014. Moreover the inferred changes to the ratio of emissions <b>of</b> the two <b>isomers</b> since the 1990 s also indicate that the sources of the two gases are, in part, independent...|$|R
