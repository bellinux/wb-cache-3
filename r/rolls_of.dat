5|$|Although {{usually more}} coins were struck at Philadelphia {{than at the}} other mints during the years the coin was struck in silver, only 12,450,181 were struck there in 1955, fewer than at the Denver Mint or at San Francisco.

The 1955 dimes from the three facilities are the lowest mintages by date and mint mark among circulating coins in the series, but are not rare, as collectors stored them away in <b>rolls</b> <b>of</b> 50.|$|E

Soon after his accession to the throne he created Sir John Howard as Duke of Norfolk and Earl Marshal of England, who became the first Howard appointed to both positions.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of Hurricane Beta, the U.S. {{ambassador}} to Nicaragua signed a disaster declaration on October28, prompting the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to send aid.

On November1, USAID and OFDA airlifted 200 <b>rolls</b> <b>of</b> plastic sheeting, 5,020 ten-litre water containers, and 2,736 hygiene kits, valued at $120,877. Another $22,000 was used to supply an aircraft and Bell 204/205 helicopter to assist affected areas. On November10, another $100,000 was sent for sanitation and health activities. The United Nations sent $10,000 to the South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region to cover emergency needs. Forty-five tents were sent to communities in need. The Spanish Government also sent $377,188 in aid and to Nicaragua.|$|E
5|$|Beckingham at {{the time}} he was {{mentioned}} in 1258 was working, probably as chief clerk, for Gilbert of Preston, the English crown's senior royal justice. This was an itinerant position, travelling in a circuit (or eyre); Gilbert's last eyre–and therefore also Beckingham's as his chief clerk–was that of 1268–72. In 1274, Beckingham himself was named an itinerant justice for Middlesex, although as yet this was not a permanent position and he was replaced by the next year. At this time he seems to have held the rank of king's serjeant. He received the commission of justice of assize in 1276. From 1273 to 1278, he was a senior clerk to the Court of Common Pleas, and was then made keeper of the writs and <b>rolls</b> <b>of</b> the court (custos rotulorum et brevium de banco) until 1285. In that year, Beckingham was appointed a Justice of the Common Pleas.|$|E
