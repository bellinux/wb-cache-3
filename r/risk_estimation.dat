25|$|At this time, the {{possible}} detrimental effects to an astronaut’s CNS from the HZE component of GCR {{have yet to}} be identified. This is largely {{due to the lack of}} a human epidemiological basis with which to estimate risks and the relatively small number of published experimental studies with animals. RBE factors are combined with human data to estimate cancer risks for low-LET radiation exposure. Since this approach is not possible for CNS risks, new approaches to <b>risk</b> <b>estimation</b> will be needed. Thus, biological research is required to establish risk levels and risk projection models and, if the risk levels are found to be significant, to design countermeasures.|$|E
25|$|Human {{epidemiology}} {{is used as}} a {{basis for}} <b>risk</b> <b>estimation</b> for cancer, acute radiation risks, and cataracts. This approach is not viable for estimating CNS risks from space radiation, however. At doses above a few Gy, detrimental CNS changes occur in humans who are treated with radiation (e.g., gamma rays and protons) for cancer. Treatment doses of 50 Gy are typical, which is well above the exposures in space even if a large SPE were to occur. Thus, of the four categories of space radiation risks (cancer, CNS, degenerative, and acute radiation syndromes), the CNS risk relies most extensively on experimental data with animals for its evidence base. Understanding and mitigating CNS risks requires a vigorous research program that will draw on the basic understanding that is gained from cellular and animal models, and on the development of approaches to extrapolate risks and the potential benefits of countermeasures for astronauts.|$|E

40|$|A robust minimax {{approach}} for optimal investment decisions with imprecise return forecasts and <b>risk</b> <b>estimations</b> in financial portfolio management is considered. Single-period and multi-period mean-variance optimization models are extended to worst-case design with multiple rival <b>risk</b> <b>estimations</b> and return forecasts. In multi-period stochastic formulation of classical mean-variance portfolio optimization problem, an investor makes an investment {{decision based on}} expectations and/or scenarios up to some intermediate times prior to the horizon and, consequently, rebalances or restructures the portfolio. Multi-period portfolio optimization entails {{the construction of a}} scenario tree representing a discretized estimate of uncertainties and associated probabilities in future stages. It is well known that return forecasts and <b>risk</b> <b>estimations</b> are inherently inaccurate and there are different rival estimates, or scenario trees. Robust optimization models are presented and imprecise nature of moment forecasts {{to reduce the risk of}} making a decision based on the wrong scenario is addressed. The worst-case performance is guaranteed in view of all rival risk and return scenarios and will only improve when any scenario other than the worst-case is realized. The ex-ante performance of minimax models is tested using historical data and backtesting results are presented. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. ...|$|R

50|$|In {{the risk}} model {{industry}} factors carry {{about half the}} explanatory power after the market effect is accounted for. However, Rosenberg had left unsolved how the industry groupings should be defined - choosing to rely simply on a conventional set of industries. Defining industry sets {{is a problem in}} taxonomy. The basic difficulty is that the industry is defined by the members assigned to it, but which industry an individual equity should be assigned to is often unclear. Difficulties can be reduced by introducing a large number of narrowly defined industries, but this approach is in tension with the demands of <b>risk</b> <b>estimation.</b> For robust risk estimates we favor a moderate number of industries with each industry representing a few percentage points of market capitalization and not exclusively dominated by the largest company in the industry.

The model is implied to the EUA spot market and compared with the traditional GARCH-VaR model, the empirical results show that the GARCH based model underestimates market risks by overlooking the great price shocks, but the GARCH-EVT based model has the ability to take those extreme jumps into its <b>risk</b> <b>estimations...</b>|$|R

50|$|At the low {{doses of}} {{relevance}} to environmental radiation exposure, individual cells only rarely experience traversals by an ionizing particle and almost never experience {{more than one}} traversal. For example, {{in the case of}} domestic radon exposure, cancer <b>risk</b> <b>estimation</b> involves epidemiological studies of uranium miners. These miners inhale radon gas, which then undergoes radioactive decay, emitting an alpha particle This alpha particle traverses the cells of the bronchial epithelium, potentially causing cancer. The average lifetime radon exposure of these miners is high enough that cancer risk estimates are driven by data on individuals whose target bronchial cells are subjected to multiple alpha particle traversals. On the other hand, for an average house occupant, about 1 in 2,500 target bronchial cells will be exposed per year to a single alpha particle, but less than 1 in 107 of these cells will experience traversals by more than one particle. Therefore, in order to extrapolate from miner to environmental exposures, it is necessary to be able to extrapolate from the effects of multiple traversals to the effects of single traversals of a particle.|$|E
50|$|The ICPR 65 model {{follows the}} same approach, and {{estimates}} the relative lifelong risk probability of radon-induced cancer death to 1.23 × 10−6 per Bq/(m3·year). This relative risk {{is a global}} indicator; the <b>risk</b> <b>estimation</b> is independent of sex, age, or smoking habit. Thus, if a smoker's chances of dying of lung cancer are 10 times that of a nonsmoker's, the relative risks for a given radon exposure {{will be the same}} according to that model, meaning that the absolute risk of a radon-generated cancer for a smoker is (implicitly) tenfold that of a nonsmoker.The risk estimates correspond to a unit risk of approximately 3-6 × 10−5 per Bq/m3, assuming a lifetime risk of lung cancer of 3%. This means that a person living in an average European dwelling with 50 Bq/m3 has a lifetime excess lung cancer risk of 1.5-3 × 10−3. Similarly, a person living in a dwelling with a high radon concentration of 1000 Bq/m3 has a lifetime excess lung cancer risk of 3-6%, implying a doubling of background lung cancer risk.|$|E

40|$|I study an agent’s optimal consumption-saving and {{portfolio}} choice decisions when he cannot fully insure his income shocks {{and does not}} know his income growth rate.

Finally, I generalize the model to allow the agent to trade risky assets to hedge against both his income <b>risk</b> and <b>estimation</b> <b>risk.</b> A more volatile and noisier underlying income process gives rise to a less volatile belief updating process. Hence, <b>estimation</b> <b>risk</b> (due to stochastic belief updating) is lower, and the implied hedging demand against <b>estimation</b> <b>risk</b> is smaller.
