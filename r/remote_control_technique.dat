40|$|Anesthesia and {{restraint}} {{of the animal}} subject are the two main factors which may modify responses evoked by stimulation of the brain. However, {{much of the information}} concerning brain physiology is of necessity based upon experiments performed under one or both of these limiting circumstances. The techniques developed thus far for the study of brain function in unanesthetized animals are described in the following paragraphs. 1. Hess, 7 one of the pioneers in the field, was the first successfully to implant electrodes in the diencephalic structures of the cat. Using the sutures of the skull as reference points, a metallic frame with a superstructure is screwed to the parietal bone. This superstructure serves to support the electrodes while they are being driven into the brain. It is then removed. Remaining are the metal frame and the electrodes. Since Hess's experiments were of short duration, aseptic precautions were not taken. 2. Variations of the <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>technique</b> have been used by Chaffee and Light, ' Clark and Ward, 8 Fender, ' Loucks, ' and Mauro. ' In thi...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse {{teleoperation}} of an ABB industrial robot with an ABB IRC 5 controller. A method to improve motion smoothness and decrease latency using the existing ABB IRC 5 robot controller without access to any low-level interface is proposed. Design/methodology/ approach - The proposed control algorithm includes a high-level proportional-integral-derivative controller (PID) controller used to dynamically generate reference velocities for different travel ranges of the tool centre point (TCP) of the robot. Communication with the ABB IRC 5 controller was performed utilising the ABB PC software development kit. The multitasking feature of the IRC 5 controller was used to enhance the communication frequency between the controller and the remote application. Trajectory tracking experiments of a pre-defined three-dimensional trajectory were carried out and the benefits of the proposed algorithm were demonstrated. The robot was intentionally installed on a wobbly table and its vibrations were recorded using a six-degrees-of-freedom force/torque sensor fitted to the tool mounting interface of the robot. The robot vibrations were used as a measure of the smoothness of the tracking movements. Findings - A communication rate of up to 250 Hz between the computer and the controller was established using C#. Net. Experimental results demonstrating the robot TCP, tracking errors and robot vibrations for different control approaches were provided and analysed. It was demonstrated that the proposed approach results in the smoothest motion with tracking errors of < 0. 2 mm. Research limitations/implications - The proposed approach may be employed to produce smooth motion for a remotely operated ABB industrial robot with the existing ABB IRC 5 controller. However, to achieve high-bandwidth path following, the inherent latency of the controller must be overcome, for example by utilising a low-level interface. It is particularly useful for applications including a large number of short manipulation segments, which is typical in teleoperation applications. Social implications - Using the proposed technique, off-the-shelf industrial robots can be used for research and industrial applications where remote control is required. Originality/value - Although low-level control interface for industrial robots seems to be the ideal long-term solution for teleoperation applications, the proposed <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>technique</b> allows out-of-the-box ABB industrial robots with IRC 5 controllers to achieve high efficiency and manipulation smoothness without requirements of any low-level programming interface. © Copyright - 2014 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

40|$|This Report {{describes}} how the electrical power distribution system of a large civil aircraft might be redesigned to employ remote power controllers, embodying solid state protection, in conjunction with solid state logic, to operate circuits remotely through lightweight signal wires. An assessment of the masses of a conventional and a remotely controlled system, based on a VC 10 installation {{in which it is}} assumed that the latest lightweight cables and switchgear are used indicates that the remotely controlled system would be about 90 kg lighter.

40|$|Abstract:- Wireless {{communication}} is adding improvements in <b>remote</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>techniques</b> of vehicles or mobile robots day by day. From mission based AGVs to biologically inspired robots each area of robotic research is being enriched {{from time to}} time with the advent of Wi-Fi technologies like 1 G, 2 G, and 3 G etc. This paper reflects a novel approach to control a mobile ad hoc network built with a number of snake robots to monitor an area like coal mines. Each agent of this network is having DSP based controller for processing files and instructions from remote computer through a wireless network structured in orthogonal frequency division access approach. DSP controllers redirect the segments of the robot to exhibit snake-like locomotion. Desired transfer function for lateral undulation is derived using two controller design approach such as, graphical domain approach and frequency response approach and the impulse response of each controller are loaded segment-wise in each agent. Length and segment-wise distinction for every robot is considered for wireless file transfer and instruction from remote station within a limited bandwidth. Problems due to inter-symbol interference (ISI), multipath fading and limitation of ISM band have also been overcome. Key-Words:- biologically inspired robot, snake robot, OFDMA, MANET...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally for Western Europe countries, joints {{in steel}} frame {{structures}} are realised using bolts and welds. In the workshop the components are made using welding and drilling {{of the bolt}} holes. On site these structural components are connected together using bolts and nuts. The actions on site means a large physical effort of the steel construction workers and is not free from danger. Measures {{that need to be}} taken to ease the work and to make it safe for the workers are increasingly expensive. Furthermore the availability of skilled workers who want to do these jobs under variable climatic conditions is decreasing. So the question arises whether there are possibilities to invent so called "plug and play" connections which can be realised using <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>techniques.</b> An extreme example is the connecting device used to dock an space shuttle to a space station. For the average steel structure we are still far away from that situation and we can do with more simple solutions but even those simple plug and play connections are so far only very limited available. Examples of non-traditional types of joints are used in Slim Floor construction. In this type of flooring, the steel beams are integrated into a prefabricated concrete hollow core slab or a deep deck composite slab. The so called plug and play beam to column joints in these mixed structures are characterised by simplicity and fast erection methods. These joints could also be used in traditional steel-concrete composite flooring systems. Most often these joints are only intended to act as a hinge. However, there are some ideas to make plug and play type joints that also can resist some bending moment even in construction stage. As holds for traditional connections also these plug and play joints should resist the forces and moments resulting from all types of loading related {{to the use of the}} structure and resulting from the natural circumstances such as wind and snow. For these type of joints no specific design rules are available in Eurocode 3, Part 1. 8 : 'Steel joints' or chapter 9 of Eurocode 4, Part 1. 1 : 'Composite joints'. The paper describes the basis of design for these joints. Design requirements will be drafted. Some considerations are given to optimise the joint with respect to overall structural behaviour from a technical and economical point of view. The costs of fabrication may slightly be higher than the costs of traditional joints provided that the total costs of fabrication and construction decrease. Fast and safe construction methods with plug and play joints are required for the future...|$|R
