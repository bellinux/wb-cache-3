5|$|The insertion-loss {{method of}} {{designing}} filters is, in essence, to prescribe a desired function of frequency for the filter as an attenuation {{of the signal}} when the filter is inserted between the terminations relative to the level {{that would have been}} received were the terminations connected to each other via an ideal transformer perfectly matching them. Versions of this theory are due to Sidney Darlington, Wilhelm Cauer and others all working more or less independently and is often taken as synonymous with network synthesis. Butterworth's filter implementation is, in those terms, an insertion-loss filter, but it is a relatively trivial one mathematically since the active amplifiers used by Butterworth ensured that each stage individually worked into a <b>resistive</b> <b>load.</b> Butterworth's filter becomes a non-trivial example when it is implemented entirely with passive components. An even earlier filter which influenced the insertion-loss method was Norton's dual-band filter where the input of two filters are connected in parallel and designed so that the combined input presents a constant resistance. Norton's design method, together with Cauer's canonical LC networks and Darlington's theorem that only LC components were required {{in the body of the}} filter resulted in the insertion-loss method. However, ladder topology proved to be more practical than Cauer's canonical forms.|$|E
5|$|An early {{application}} of these new theoretical tools was in phonographic sound reproduction. A recurring problem with early phonograph designs was that mechanical resonances in the pickup and sound transmission mechanism caused excessively large peaks and troughs in the frequency response, resulting in poor sound quality. In 1923, Harrison of the Western Electric Company filed a patent for a phonograph in which the mechanical design was entirely represented as an electrical circuit. The horn of the phonograph is represented as a transmission line, and is a <b>resistive</b> <b>load</b> {{for the rest of}} the circuit, while all the mechanical and acoustic parts—from the pickup needle through to the horn—are translated into lumped components according to the impedance analogy. The circuit arrived at is a ladder topology of series resonant circuits coupled by shunt capacitors. This can be viewed as a bandpass filter circuit. Harrison designed the component values of this filter to have a specific passband corresponding to the desired audio passband (in this case 100Hz to 6kHz) and a flat response. Translating these electrical element values back into mechanical quantities provided specifications for the mechanical components in terms of mass and stiffness, which in turn could be translated into physical dimensions for their manufacture. The resulting phonograph has a flat frequency response in its passband and is free of the resonances previously experienced. Shortly after this, Harrison filed another patent using the same methodology on telephone transmit and receive transducers.|$|E

As {{the magnitude of the}} inspiratory loads increased, dyspnea scores increased (P< 0. 001), but {{there was no difference between}} groups in dyspnea score (P= 0. 654). Twenty-six (84 %) normal subjects completed all the <b>resistive</b> <b>loads,</b> compared with only 12 (39 %) cystic fibrosis patients (P< 0. 001). Dyspnea scores were higher after the 6 -min walk test than at rest (P< 0. 001), but did not differ between groups (P= 0. 080). Post- 6 -min walk test dyspnea scores correlated significantly with dyspnea scores induced by <b>resistive</b> <b>loads.</b> We conclude that dyspnea perception induced in cystic fibrosis patients by inspiratory <b>resistive</b> <b>loading</b> and by 6 -min walk test did not differ from that induced in normal subjects.

40|$|Background and objective: Diaphragmatic {{breathing}} patterns under <b>resistive</b> <b>loading</b> remain poorly documented. To our knowledge, this is {{the first}} study assessing diaphragmatic motion under conditions of inspiratory <b>resistive</b> <b>loading</b> with the use of sonography. Methods: We assessed diaphragmatic motion during inspiratory <b>resistive</b> <b>loading</b> in 40 healthy volunteers using M-mode sonography. In phase I of the study, sonography was performed during normal quiet breathing without respiratory loading. In phase II, sonography was performed after application of a nose clip and connection of the subjects to a pneumotachograph through a mouth piece. In phase III, the participants were assessed while subjected to inspiratory <b>resistive</b> <b>loading</b> of 50 cm H 2 O/L/s. Results: Compared with baseline, the application of a mouth piece and nose clip induced a significant increase in diaphragmatic excursion (from 1. 7 to 2. 3 cm, P < 0. 001) and a decrease in respiratory rate (from 13. 4 to 12. 2, P < 0. 01). Inspiratory <b>resistive</b> <b>loading</b> induced a further decrease in respiratory rate (from 12. 2 to 8. 0, P < 0. 01) and a decrease in diaphragmatic velocity contraction (from 1. 2 to 0. 8 cm/s, P < 0. 01), and also an increase in tidal volume (from 795 to 904 mL, P < 0. 01); diaphragmatic excursion, however, did not change significantly. Conclusions: Inspiratory <b>resistive</b> <b>loading</b> induced significant changes in diaphragmatic contraction pattern, which mainly consisted of decreased velocity of diaphragmatic displacement with no change in diaphragmatic excursion.

External <b>resistive</b> <b>loading,</b> on the other hand, reduced respiratory rate and inspiratory flow, but left ventilation and PACO 2 unaltered.

However, the change in occlusion pressure produced by a given change in resistance and the absolute level of occlusion pressure at comparable levels of airway resistance were greater during bronchospasm than during external loading. These differences in occlusion pressure responses to the two forms of obstruction were not explained by differences in chemical drive or respiratory muscle mechanical advantage. Although the subjects' perception of the effort involved in breathing was heightened during both forms of obstruction to airflow, at any given level of resistance the sense of effort was greater with bronchospasm than external loading.

The constant <b>resistive</b> <b>loading</b> is applied using volumetric microwave absorbers to cover one side of the antenna and the linear capacitive loading is realized by constructing narrow slots on the antenna surface. Relatively high radiation efficiency is achieved by choosing the location of the slot nearest to the feed point {{in such a way that}} radiation from it combines constructively with radiation from the feed point. Using a 0. 8 -ns monocycle for ex-citation, the technique results in a level of late-time ringing of lower than 40 dB and at the same time the peak value of the transmitted pulse is 54 % higher than that of the same antenna without loading.

A secondary objective was to see whether dyspnea (estimated discomfort experienced with breathing using the Borg 0 - 10 scale) and the oxygen consumption of the respiratory muscles are closely related across conditions. This would be expected if intramuscular sensory nerve fibres stimulated as a consequence of metabolic events contributed to this sensation. In six normal subjects the respiratory muscles were progressively activated by the addition of incremental inspiratory <b>resistive</b> <b>loads</b> to a maximum of 300 cm H 20 ×s/L (SD= 66. 4), and incremental dead space to a maximum of 2638 mL (SD= 452), associated with an increase in ventilation to 75. 1 L/min (SD= 29. 79).
