Retrospectively analyze 50 cases of the patients from Oct. 2010 to Aug. 2013. Before operation all the patients received dilatation & curettage to determine pathological diagnosis and clinical staging. There were 150 cases of patients who received B-mode ultrasound examination, wherein, 93 cases <b>received</b> <b>CT</b> <b>examination</b> and 57 cases received MRI examination as well. In the diagnosis of MIEC the diagnostic indicies of individual MRI examination were {{higher than that of}} individual B-mode ultrasound and CT examinations. Consistency of individual MRI examination with pathological diagnosis was significantly higher than that of B-mode and CT examinations. The sensitivity of CT and MRI was significantly higher than that of B-mode ultrasound examination. However, diagnostic indicators of B-mode ultrasound and CT joint examination were higher than B-mode ultrasound examination alone. The consistency of both with pathological diagnosis was significantly increased. B-mode and CT can significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy and has a good consistency with pathological diagnosis, thereby applicable to the clinical diagnosis of preoperative myometrial infiltration of endometrial cancer and lymph node metastasis...|$|E

30|$|All {{data was}} {{collected}} retrospectively {{as part of a}} medical audit and hence ethical approval was not required. For each patient, their age, gender, fluoroscopic screening time and the dose of radiation received during the EVAR procedure was collected from information electronically stored on our picture archiving and communications system (PACS). All patients <b>received</b> one <b>CT</b> <b>examination</b> pre-EVAR followed by two surveillance <b>CT</b> <b>examinations</b> at 6  weeks and 12  months post-EVAR (as per the EVAR- 1 Trial protocol). The initial planning CT was used to determine the anatomy of the patient’s aorta in order to correctly size the aortic stent and determine the optimum landing zone, whilst the surveillance <b>CT</b> <b>examinations</b> were to check for any complications following stent placement. The average radiation dose <b>received</b> from a <b>CT</b> aorta <b>examination</b> was calculated from the parameters set in the CT protocol.|$|R
30|$|Of more {{concern is}} the {{additional}} increase in the radiation burden when the first year <b>CT</b> <b>examinations</b> are taken into consideration. As part of the EVAR- 1 trial protocol, every patient also <b>received</b> one <b>CT</b> <b>examination</b> at 2  months pre-EVAR, to plan the procedure based on the anatomy of their aorta, and two surveillance <b>CT</b> <b>examinations</b> at 6  weeks and 12  months post-EVAR, to determine any complications following aortic stent placement. Based on our department’s CT protocols, the mean radiation <b>received</b> from a <b>CT</b> aorta <b>examination</b> was 916.5  mGy.cm. Hence, if a patient <b>receives</b> three <b>CT</b> <b>examinations</b> within the first year, this amounts to 2, 749.5  mGy.cm. When converted to an effective dose, this works out as 48  mSv of radiation, which is a considerable dose, especially {{with respect to the}} average yearly background dose of only 2.4  mSv. In addition, if a patient also requires a pre-EVAR iliac artery embolisation, then the mean radiation dose received from this intervention was 25.8  mSv. Surprisingly, this intervention delivered a greater dose of radiation to the patient than an EVAR procedure itself, probably due to the repeated fluoroscopic sequences often with oblique imaging, which need to be undertaken to complete the embolisation procedure. If this dose is also taken into account, then the radiation burden to patients can be fairly considerable within the first year. Although many patients who undergo open aneurysm repair will also require at least a pre-operative CT for planning and possibly even an early post-operative CT for evaluation of potential intra-abdominal complications, EVAR patients will in reality require yearly <b>CT</b> <b>examinations</b> for lifelong surveillance of their aortic stents, further exposing them to radiation doses which will increase their lifetime risk of developing a radiation-induced cancer.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{processing}} of <b>CT</b> data <b>received</b> during the <b>CT</b> <b>examination</b> of the vessels - CT angiography. The area of interest is the extracranial course of the carotic arteries. Regarding the major role of these vessels in the blood supply of the brain cells this examination is frequently performed and influences the diagnostic decision and following therapy in case of pathological changes of the vessels. The contemporary clinical software included in the tomographs does not provide sufficient comfort for easy 3 -dimensional orientation which {{is necessary for the}} diagnostics. The automatic segmentation and classification of the vessels might be a possible solution to this problem and also a great challenge. For the segmentation of the extracranial part of the carotic arteries the parallel and robust model fitting algorithm was used. The parameters of the model make it possible to classify the vessel and to draw attention to its stenosis, for example. The algorithm was tested on both synthetic and real data. The core of the system is implemented as a set of separate ITK filters.

40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{analyzes}} <b>CT</b> <b>examinations</b> in Switzerland. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using {{different sources}} (administrative {{data on the}} equipment, a 1998 nationwide inquiry into practices, and data provided by the Swiss University Hospitals of Basel, Zurich, and Lausanne), we determined the frequency of <b>CT</b> <b>examinations</b> (hospitals and private radiologists) in 1998 according to different descriptive variables and studied the progression in CT use over time. RESULTS: CT scanners increased by 7 % between 1998 and 2004. The average annual number of <b>CT</b> <b>examinations</b> in 1998 was 46. 3 / 1000 population, 3. 4 % of all radiological examinations in Switzerland in 1997 - 1998.

40|$|Purpose: To {{estimate}} {{the performance of}} digital chest radiography for detection of lung cancer. Materials and Methods: The study had ethics committee approval, and a nested case-control design was used and included 55 patients with lung cancer detected at computed tomography (CT) and confirmed with histologic examination and a sample of 72 of 4873 control subjects without nodules at CT. All patients underwent direct-detector digital chest radiography in two projections within 2 months of the screening CT. Four radiologists with varying experience identified and localized potential cancers on chest radiographs by using a confidence scale of level 1 (no lesion) to 5 (definite lesion).

On {{the basis of the}} assumption that suspicious lesions seen at chest radiography would lead to further work-up with CT, the number of work-up <b>CT</b> <b>examinations</b> per detected cancer (<b>CT</b> <b>examinations</b> per cancer) was calculated at various confidence levels for the screening population (cancer rate in study population, 1. 3 %). Results: Tumor size ranged from 6. 8 to 50. 7 mm (median, 11. 8 mm). Areas under the localization ROC curve ranged from 0. 52 to 0. 69. Detection rates substantially varied with the observers' experience and confidence level: At a confidence level of 5, detection rates ranged from 18 % at one <b>CT</b> <b>examination</b> per cancer to 53 % at 13 <b>CT</b> <b>examinations</b> per cancer.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the incremental prognostic {{value of the}} number and maximum volume of coronary artery calcifications over modified Agatston score strata, age, pack-years, and smoking status for predicting cardiovascular events. Methods: A total of 3559 male current and former smokers <b>received</b> a <b>CT</b> <b>examination</b> for lung cancer screening. Smoking characteristics, patient demographics, and physician-diagnosed cardiovascular events were collected. Images were acquired without electro-cardiography gating on 16 -slice CT scanners. The association between the presence of both fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events and the predictors was quantified using Cox proportional hazard analysis. Results: Median follow-up period was 2. 9 years. Incident cardiovascular events occurred in 186 participants. Adjusted hazard ratios for modified Agatston score strata of 1 to 10, 11 to 100, 101 to 400, and > 400 were 3. 39 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 20 - 9. 59), 6. 52 (95 % CI, 2. 73 - 15. 60), 6. 58 (95 % CI, 2. 75 - 15. 78), and 12. 58, (95 % CI, 5. 42 - 29. 16), respectively. Moreover, comparing the models with and without Modified Agatston score strata to the model with age, pack-years, and smoking status yielded a significantly better net reclassification improvement (NRI; 27. 3 %; P <. 0001). Adding the number of calcifications to the model with age, pack-years, smoking status, and modified Agatston score strata resulted in a slightly better NRI (1. 68 %; P =. 0490) with a hazard ratio of 1. 13 (95 % CI, 1. 05 - 1. 21) per 10 calcificatiOns. The incremental prognostic information contained in {{the volume of the}} largest calcification was not statistically significant (NRI, 0. 14 %; P =. 3458). Conclusion: Cardiovascular event rate increased with higher numbers of calcified lesions. The number but not maximum volume of calcifications has independent, although minimal, prognostic value over age, pack-years, smoking status, and modified Agatston score strata in our population.
