40|$|We {{review the}} recent {{measurements}} of the current-phase relation in cuprate Josephson junctions. Special {{attention is paid to}} 45 degree grain boundary junctions and to c-axis junctions between YBCO and Nb. It is shown that the anomalous properties of such junctions which have been found experimentally (large second harmonic of the current phase <b>relation,</b> <b>sign</b> change of the first harmonic as a function of temperature) are qualitatively consistent with the d-wave symmetry of pairing in the cuprates. It is argued that in order to describe the data quantitatively, quantum fluctuations of the order parameter need to be taken into account. It is pointed out that the Josephson effect is an ideal tool for measuring the reduced phase stiffness in the cuprates. Comment: to appear in Studies of High Temperature Superconductors, ed. A.

40|$|The {{present study}} will {{approach}} some analytical and applicative levels regarding: a psychoanalytic pattern: representation / symbol/ fetishism;; the consecrated models and their psychoanalytic exhaustion, establishing that beyond what we usually call, tolerant {{to the external}} theoretical influences, a signs pragmatic, {{the idea of an}} infinite semiozis provides for a imperative which emits that something is a sign only if it is interpreted as a sign for something by an interpreter. The triad sign – type – occurrence or the <b>relation</b> <b>sign</b> – icon – index – symbol establishes, pragmatically, a signification relation marked as sign -interpreter- object. Far from being a primitive form, fetishism appeals to successive strokes, through (re) adjustments and corrections, disputing its analytical route with the symbolic pattern; it renounces to "speak" about the object, awkwardly moving towards representation as a common difficulty of analysis. Fetishism expresses the way in which knowing the other is made as assimilation. To assimilate corresponds in this case with transforming, metabolizing the other, identifying him and finally, removing his alterity...|$|E

50|$|Semiotics (also called {{semiotic}} {{studies and}} in the Saussurean tradition called semiology) {{is the study of}} meaning-making, the philosophical theory of signs and symbols. This includes the study of signs and sign processes (semiosis), indication, designation, likeness, analogy, metaphor, symbolism, signification, and communication. Semiotics is closely related to the field of linguistics, which, for its part, studies the structure and meaning of language more specifically. As different from linguistics, however, semiotics also studies non-linguistic sign systems. Semiotics often is divided into three branches:Semantics is the <b>relation</b> between <b>signs</b> and the things to which they refer; their denotata, or meaning. Syntactics is <b>relations</b> among <b>signs</b> in formal structures. Pragmatics is the <b>relation</b> between <b>signs</b> and sign-using agents.|$|R

50|$|This definition, {{together}} with Peirce's definitions of correspondence and determination, {{is sufficient to}} derive all of the statements that are necessarily true for all <b>sign</b> <b>relations.</b> Yet, {{there is much more}} to the theory of signs than simply proving universal theorems about generic <b>sign</b> <b>relations.</b> There is also the task of classifying the various species and subspecies of <b>sign</b> <b>relations.</b> As a practical matter, of course, familiarity with the full range of concrete examples is indispensable to theory and application both.|$|R

50|$|Syntactics is the Morris'ean {{branch of}} {{semiotics}} {{that deals with}} the formal properties of signs and symbols; the interrelation of the signs, without regard to meaning. Semantics deals with the <b>relation</b> of <b>signs</b> to their designata and the objects that they may or do denote; the <b>relation</b> between the <b>signs</b> and the objects to which they apply. Finally, pragmatics deals with the biotic aspects of semiosis, with all the psychological, biological, and sociological phenomena {{that occur in the}} functioning of signs; the <b>relation</b> between the <b>sign</b> system and its human (or animal) user. Unlike his mentor George Herbert Mead, Morris was a behaviorist and sympathetic to the Vienna Circle positivism of his colleague, Rudolf Carnap.

50|$|Understood {{in terms}} of its {{set-theoretic}} extension, a <b>sign</b> <b>relation</b> L is a subset of a cartesian product O × S × I.

50|$|Generally speaking, when {{it comes}} to things that are being {{contemplated}} as ostensible or potential signs of other things, neither the existence nor the uniqueness of the elements appearing in the <b>sign</b> <b>relation</b> is guaranteed. For example, the reference of a putative sign to its putative objects may achieve reference to zero, to one, or to many objects. A proper treatment of this complication calls for the conception of something slightly more general than a <b>sign</b> <b>relation</b> proper, namely, a sign relational complex. In effect, expressed in the roughest practical terms, this allows for missing data in the columns of the relational database table for the <b>sign</b> <b>relation</b> in question. Typically one operates on the default assumption that all of the roles of elementary <b>sign</b> <b>relations</b> are filled, but remains wary enough of the possible exceptions to deal with them on an ad hoc basis.|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} {{economic}} sciences makes available to analysts many interpretation types of economic phenomena and processes: economic analysis and statistics offer a realistic view based on figures {{or in other}} words on the analysis of optimum use of resources under given assumptions and constraints. Semantics, a quasi-universal science, offers other ways of interpretation: the <b>relations</b> among <b>signs</b> subordinated to syntax; the <b>relation</b> between <b>signs</b> and their interpreter belonging to pragmatics; semantics explain the <b>relation</b> between <b>signs</b> and the represented objects. What happens when the externalities generated by market economy need an interpretation {{from the perspective of}} social values? This field is underdeveloped in economy. We think that interpretation belongs here, within the wider frame of economic hermeneutics that includes the axiological interpretation – in order to identify the hidden causes of the economic agents’ behavior-, the behavioristic-institutional interpretation – {{from the perspective of the}} analysis of individual behavior- and praxeological interpretation – analyzing human actions and their efficiency. The purpose of this approach is to have a better global view of the economic phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we propose {{computational}} {{approach to the}} Peircean triadic model of semiosis (meaning processes). We investigate several theoretical constraints on the feasibility of a simulated semiosis within digital computers. These constraints, which are basic requirements for the simulation of semiosis, refer to the synthesis of irreducible triadic <b>relations</b> (<b>Sign</b> [...] Object [...] Interpretant). We examine the internal organization of the triad, that is, the relative position of its elements and how they {{relate to each other}} by determinative relations. We also suggest a computational approach based on selforganization principles. In this context, relations of determination are described as emergent properties of the system...|$|R
50|$|Another {{aspect of}} meaning {{concerns}} the connection that a sign has to its interpretants {{within a given}} <b>sign</b> <b>relation.</b> As before, this type of connection can be vacuous, singular, or plural in its collection of terminal points, {{and it can be}} formalized as the dyadic relation that is obtained as a planar projection of the triadic <b>sign</b> <b>relation</b> in question.|$|R
