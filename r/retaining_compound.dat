40|$|Today {{scientists}} {{must deal}} with complex samples that either cannot be adequately separated using one-dimensional chromatography or that require {{an inordinate amount of}} time for separation. For these cases we need two-dimensional chromatography because it takes far less time to generate a peak capacity n(c) twice in a row than to generate a peak capacity n(c) ^ 2 once. Liquid chromatography has been carried out successfully on thin layers of adsorbents and along tubes filled with various adsorbents. The first type of separation sorts out the sample components in a physical separation space that is the layer of packing material. The analysis time is the same for all the components of the sample while their migration distance increases with decreasing retention. The resolution between two components having a certain separation factor (alpha) increases with increasing migration distance, i. e., from the strongly to the weakly <b>retained</b> <b>compounds.</b> In the second type of separation, the sample components are eluted from the column and separated in the time space, their migration distances are all the same while their retention times increase from the unretained to the strongly <b>retained</b> <b>compounds.</b> Separation efficiency varies little with retention, as long as the components are eluted from the column. We call these two types of separation the chromatographic separations in space (LC(x)) and the chromatographic separations in time (LC(t)), respectively. In principle, there are four ways to combine these two modes and do two-dimensional chromatographic separations, LC(t) xLC(t), LC(x) xLC(t), LC(t) xLC(x), and LC(x) xLC(x). We review, discuss and compare the potential performance of these combinations, their advantages, drawbacks, problems, perspectives and results. Currently, column-based combinations (LC(t) xLC(t)) are the most actively pursued. We suggest that the combination LC(x) xLC(t) shows exceptional promise because it permits the simultaneous second-dimension separations of all the fractions separated in the first-dimension, thus providing remarkable time saving...|$|R

By this criterion bodbiz, Chicom, Comsymp, Intelsat, midcult, pro-am, photo op, sci-fi, and sitcom are all compounds made of clippings.|$|R
40|$|For the {{separation}} of peptides with gradient-elution liquid chromatography a poly(butyl methacrylate-co-ethylene dimethacrylate) (BMA) monolithic capillary column was prepared and tested. The conditional peak capacity {{was used as a}} metric for the performance of this column, which was compared with a capillary column packed with C 18 -modified silica particles. The retention of the peptides was found to be smaller on the BMA column than on the particulate C 18 column. To obtain the same retention in isocratic elution an approximately 15 % (v/v) lower acetonitrile concentration had {{to be used in the}} mobile phase. The retention window in gradient elution was correspondingly smaller with the BMA column. The relation between peak width and retention under gradient conditions was studied in detail. It was found that in shallow gradients, with gradient times of 30 min and more, the peak widths of the least <b>retained</b> <b>compounds</b> are strongly increased with the BMA column. This was attributed to the fact that these compounds migrate and elute with an unfavorable high retention factor. More <b>retained</b> <b>compounds</b> are eluted later in the gradient, but with a lower effective retention factor. With shallow gradients the peak capacity of the BMA column (approximate to 90) was clearly lower than that of a conventional packed column (approximate to 150). On the other hand, with steep gradients, when components elute with a low effective retention factor, the performance of the BMA column is relatively good. With a gradient time of 15 min similar peak widths and thus similar peak capacities (approximate to 75) were found for the packed and the monolithic column. Two strategies were investigated to obtain higher peak capacities with methacrylate monolithic columns. The use of lauryl methacrylate (LMA) instead of butyl methacrylate (BMA) gave an increase in retention and narrower peaks for early eluting peptides. The peak capacity of the LMA column was approximate to 125 in a 60 min gradient. Another approach was to use a longer BMA column which resulted in a peak capacity of approximate to 135 could be obtained in 60 min...|$|R

40|$|Highly polar metabolites, such as sugars {{and most}} amino acids are not {{retained}} by conventional RP LC columns.

Approximately 1000 compounds were reproducibly detected in human urine samples and clear differences between these samples were identified. This chromatography was also applied to xylem fluid from soyabean (Glycine max) plants to which 400 compounds were detected.

We demonstrate that the introduction of barium ensures a complete removal of carbonate, {{making it possible to}} carry out a large number of separations without column reequilibration after each run. This is particularly helpful when diluted alkaline eluents (i. e., < 20 mM NaOH) are employed. Under such experimental conditions, the analysis time of carbohydrates is drastically reduced and the reproducibility of the chromatographic data greatly improved. For example, the normalized capacity factor (k¢/k¢ 0) of lactulose, which represents the most <b>retained</b> <b>compound</b> investigated using 16 mM NaOH as the eluent, exhibits only a slight decrease from 1. 00 to 0. 94 after 7. 5 h of chromatographic run.

30|$|Thin layer {{chromatography}} (TLC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} favorite and conventional methods for screening and detection of drug abuse (Shetab Boushehri et al. 2009). Simultaneous development of drugs and poisons on one TLC plate has made it a rapid method (Ahadi et al. 2011; Shetab Boushehri et al. 2009). Modern computer-controlled scanning instruments and automated sample application and development instruments permit accuracy and precision in quantification that are, in many cases, comparable with those obtained with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC). There is a wide range of layers and developing solvents (acidic, basic, completely aqueous, aqueous-organic). Solvents that interfere with HPLC UV detection can be used in TLC because the mobile phase can be removed from the plate before detection. Every sample is separated on a fresh layer, so that problems result from retaining and cross-contamination of samples and sorbent regeneration procedures are avoided. Low mobile-phase consumption results in reduced costs of solvent purchase and disposal. Because layers are normally disposable, sample preparation methods are less required, and complex, impure samples can be applied to the layer without concern for the interfering peaks and <b>retained</b> <b>compounds</b> that shorten the life of HPLC columns. Simultaneous sample cleanup and separation of target compounds are often achieved with TLC (Sherma 2003).|$|R
40|$|A novel {{approach}} for sample enrichment, namely, equilibrium sorptive enrichment (ESE), is presented. A packed bed of sorption (or partitioning) material {{is used to}} enrich volatiles from gaseous samples. Normally, air sampling is stopped before breakthrough occurs, but this approach is not very successful for weakly <b>retained</b> <b>compounds</b> (volatiles) as early breakthrough occurs. In ESE, sampling is continued until all compounds of interest are in equilibrium with the sorptive material. This allows accurate sampling of volatiles and enrichment at the maximum attainable sensitivity. However, due to the equilibrium nature of ESE, it is limited to samples with a constant concentration over the sampling time. This requirement is easily met for those compounds with short equilibration times (volatiles). Because {{of the nature of}} the sorption mechanism, which is basically dissolution, all compounds partition independently into the sorbent (stationary phase) and displacement effects do not occur. This is a great advantage over adsorption materials. Additionally, theory allows the calculation of enrichment factors from literature retention indexes. Moreover, ESE also benefits from the features of sorption materials such as a very high inertness and interference-free blanks. The performance of ESE is illustrated with the analysis of several analytes including the epoxides ethylene oxide and epichlorohydrin in real-life air sampling...|$|R

Although many of the causes and consequences of oxidative stress and inflammation in CKD have been extensively explored, little attention had been paid to the intestine and its microbial flora as a potential source of these problems. Our recent studies have revealed significant disruption of the colonic, ileal, jejunal and gastric epithelial tight junction in different models of CKD in rats. Moreover, the disruption of the epithelial barrier structure and function found in uremic animals was replicated in cultured human colonocytes exposed to uremic human plasma in vitro We have further found significant changes in the composition and function of colonic bacterial flora in humans and animals with advanced CKD. Together, uremia-induced impairment of the intestinal epithelial barrier structure and function and changes in composition of the gut microbiome contribute to the systemic inflammation and uremic toxicity by accommodating the translocation of endotoxin, microbial fragments and other noxious luminal products in the circulation.

40|$|Poly(styrene-divinyl benzene) (PS-DVB) resin is an {{attractive}} adsorbent for extraction and separation of various types of compounds {{due to its stability}} over the pH range of 1 - 14. However, PS-DVB resin is known to have hydrophobic surfaces that highly <b>retain</b> non-polar <b>compounds</b> while poorly <b>retain</b> polar <b>compounds.</b> To improve its use in the separation or extraction of polar compounds, PS-DVB resin must be chemically or physically bonded to hydrophilic groups to reduce its hydrophobic surface. The objectives of this project were to modify PS-DVB phases by introducing moieties that can increase the dispersive forces and lower the hydrophobicity of the PS-DVB phases and to examine the characteristics and applications of the modified PS-DVB adsorbents. The PS-DVB adsorbents were prepared by suspension polymerization method with polyvinyl alcohol as the suspension stabilizer at a stirring speed of 1000 rpm for 20 h. In the first approach (Volume 1), the synthesized PS-DVB adsorbents were subjected to modifications that consisted of (i) Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction using stearoyl chloride as an acylation agent to produce PS-DVB heptadecyl ketone, (ii) Chloromethylation reaction to produce chloromethyl PS-DVB in the presence of chloromethyl styrene, and (iii) Williamson ether reaction using sodium metal and octadecanol as reaction agents to produce octadecoxy methyl PS-DVB.

This improved performance towards small molecules was attributed to an increased mesopore proportion in the monolith and the faster dynamic process of mass transfer arising from novel tailoring of the monolith by choosing a suitable monomer/cross-linker pair.

40|$|Some {{valuable}} insights {{have been obtained}} in the inherent fitting problems when trying to predict theretention time of complex, multi-modal retention modes such as encountered in HILIC and SFC. In thisstudy, we used mathematical models with known input parameters to generate different sets of numericaltest curves representative for systems exhibiting a complex, non-LSS dual retention behavior. Subse-quently, we tried to fit these data sets using some popular (non-linear) literature models. Even in caseswhere a physical fitting model exists (e. g., the mixed model in case of pure additive adsorptive andpartitioning retention), the fitting quality can only {{be expected to be}} relatively good (prediction errorsexpressed in terms of a normalized resolution error εRs) when carefully selecting the scouting runs andthe appropriate starting values for the fitting algorithm. The latter can best be done using a comprehen-sive grid search scanning a wide range of different starting values. This becomes even more importantwhen no good physical model is available and one has to use a non-physical fitting model, such as theempirical Neue-model. The use of higher-order models is found to be quasi indispensable to keep theprediction errors on the order of some ΔRs= 0. 05. Also, the choice of the scouting runs becomes evenmore important using these higher-order models. For highly <b>retained</b> <b>compounds</b> we recommend usingscouting runs with long tG/t 0 -values or to include a run with a higher fraction of eluting solvent at thestart of the gradient. When trying to predict gradient retention, errors with which the isocratic retentionbehavior is fitted are much less important for high retention factors k than errors made in the range of knear the one at the point of elution. The results obtained with a so-called segmented Neue-model (con-taining 7 parameters) were less good and thus practically not interesting (because of the high number ofinitial runs). © 2015 Elsevier B.

50|$|BCC and SCC often carry a UV-signature {{mutation}} {{indicating that}} these cancers {{are caused by}} UVB radiation via direct DNA damage. However malignant melanoma is predominantly caused by UVA radiation via indirect DNA damage. The indirect DNA damage is caused by free radicals and reactive oxygen species. Research indicates that the absorption of three sunscreen ingredients into the skin, combined with a 60-minute exposure to UV, leads to an increase of free radicals in the skin, if applied in too little quantities and too infrequently. However, the researchers add that newer creams often do not contain these specific compounds, and {{that the combination of}} other ingredients tends to <b>retain</b> the <b>compounds</b> {{on the surface of the}} skin. They also add the frequent re-application reduces the risk of radical formation.|$|R
