40|$|An {{alternative}} method using liquid chromatography with UV detection for the determination <b>of</b> <b>prochloraz</b> as 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol in mango, papaya and orange is described. Ethyl acetate, acetone and dichloromethane were tested for extraction <b>of</b> <b>prochloraz</b> from the fruits. After extraction the <b>residue</b> <b>of</b> <b>prochloraz</b> was derivatized with pyridine hydrochloride. The analysis {{was carried out}} using liquid chromatography with UV detection and gas chromatography with electron-capture detection. Average recoveries <b>of</b> <b>prochloraz</b> from spiked fruits (0. 1 and 0. 2 mg kg- 1) ranged from 80 % to 94 % with relative standard deviations between 5. 6 % and 12. 6 % (n= 8). Detection and quantification limits were 0. 05 and 0. 1 mg kg- 1, respectively. The LC-UV method was applied to mango and papaya samples submitted to dip treatment with a prochloraz formulation under laboratory conditions.

Water samples collected on 0 (2 h), 3, 7, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 days after treatments were processed for <b>residue</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>Prochloraz</b> by HPLC-UV detector. In 60 days, dissipation was 89. 12 - 90. 53 % at pH 4. 0, 84. 10 - 88. 17 % at pH 7. 0, and 92. 35 - 93. 81 % at pH 9. 2 in both treatments. The results indicate that at pH 7. 0 the degradation <b>of</b> <b>Prochloraz</b> was much slower as compared to other two. Among pH 4. 0 and 9. 2 the degradation of compound is little faster at pH 9. 2.

40|$|The residue {{dynamics}} and risk assessment <b>of</b> <b>prochloraz</b> and its metabolite 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol (2, 4, 6 -TCP) in apple under different treatment concentrations were investigated using a GC-ECD method. The derivatization percent <b>of</b> <b>prochloraz</b> to 2, 4, 6 -TCP was stable and complete. The recoveries <b>of</b> <b>prochloraz</b> and 2, 4, 6 -TCP were 82. 9 %– 114. 4 %, and the coefficients of variation (CV) were 0. 7 %– 8. 6 % {{for the whole}} fruit, apple pulp, and apple peel samples. Under the application of 2 °C 2. 0 g/L, 2 °C 1. 0 g/L, 20 °C 2. 0 g/L, and 20 °C 1. 0 g/L treatment, the half-life for the degradation <b>of</b> <b>prochloraz</b> was 57. 8 – 86. 6 d in the whole fruit and apple peel, and the prochloraz concentration in the apple pulp increased gradually until a peak (0. 72 mg·kg− 1) was reached.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we aimed at characterizing the effect <b>of</b> <b>prochloraz,</b> an {{imidazole}} fungicide, on the oocyte meiotic maturation {{process in a}} freshwater teleost species, the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Full-grown post-vitellogenic ovarian follicles were incubated in vitro with prochloraz, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), or a combination <b>of</b> <b>prochloraz</b> and LH. The occurrence of oocyte maturation was assessed by monitoring germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) after 62 -h in vitro incubation. Experiments were repeated in presence of actinomycin D, cycloheximide, or trilostane. The effect <b>of</b> <b>prochloraz</b> on the production of 17, 20 beta-dihydroxy- 4 -pregnen- 3 -one (17, 20 beta P), the natural maturation-inducing steroid, was quantified by radioimmunoassay. In addition, the effect <b>of</b> <b>prochloraz</b> on ovarian expression of 12 genes was monitored by real-time PCR. Prochloraz (10 (- 5) M) administered alone was able to induce 100 % GVBD in the most responsive females. The occurrence of GVBD observed after <b>prochloraz</b> stimulation <b>of</b> follicles originating from various females was similar and highly correlated with the occurrence of GVBD observed after stimulation with low LH concentration. In addition, oocyte maturation induced by LH or prochloraz was totally inhibited by actinomycin D, cycloheximide, and trilostane. Similarly to LH, prochloraz was able to trigger 17, 20 beta P production by the ovarian follicle. Finally, prochloraz induced the overexpression of genes participating in 17, 20 beta P production, intercellular communication, and paracrine control of preovulatory follicular differentiation such as igf, igf 2, connexin 43, and 20 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (hsbd 20). Together, our results demonstrate that prochloraz administered alone is able to trigger oocyte maturation through the induction of specific genes, some of them being also triggered by LH.

Physiologically mature fruits were immersed in a solution <b>of</b> <b>prochloraz</b> (49. 5 g/ 100 liters of water) for 5 min. Fruit treated with distilled water and air dried were used as control. They were immersed in cassava starch suspension at concentrations of 0, 20, 30 and 40 g/L, plus 0. 5 mL/L of mineral oil. The fruits were stored at 21. 0 ± 1. 0 ºC and relative humidity of 85 ± 5 %, for 12 days, and were examined at every three days. The combination <b>of</b> <b>prochloraz</b> and cassava starch resulted in delayed loss of firmness and yellowness and inhibited the incidence of lesions caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides during the 12 days of storage. Fruits treated with 40 g/L of starch, whether containing prochloraz or not, had unpleasant taste and odor, which suggests the occurrence of fermentation. Control fruits, with and without prochloraz, and those treated with starch with no prochloraz, had nearly 100 % lesion occurrence within the 12 days.

The aim was to test the efficacy <b>of</b> <b>prochloraz</b> to inhibit in vitro growth of P. teres. Potato dextrose agar (PDA) dishes amended with 0. 1 and 1. 0 ìg ml- 1 prochloraz were used for testing 364 isolates of P. teres based on prelimenary experiment. Isolates from MTTs experimental field were growing slower on fungicide- amended media than isolates from farmers fields.

40|$|In {{this study}} a gravity model {{was used to}} {{investigate}} the impact of country specific MRLs that are more stringent than the MRLs set by CODEX on avocado exports by South Africa to the EU with specific reference to Prochloraz. The results revealed that the more stringent Prochloraz MRLs indeed {{have an impact on}} avocado exports to the EU. The simulation results show that the revenue foregone due to the more stringent Prochloraz MRLs is US$ 15. 27 million. In relative terms this is significant, and should the Prochloraz MRLs be relaxed to the CODEX levels the contribution of the avocado industry to the gross domestic value of agricultural products would increase significantly. Furthermore, several studies have revealed the potentially negative impacts of abnormal levels <b>of</b> <b>Prochloraz.</b> The question arises why there are anomalies in the application <b>of</b> <b>Prochloraz</b> MRLs between countries and whether the CODEX MRL already account for these negative impacts.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the persistence of endocrine effects by prochloraz, a fungicide known to have multiple effects on the endocrine system of vertebrates. Since discontinuous exposure is particularly relevant in aquatic ecosystems, an exposure scenario with an exposure phase and a subsequent recovery period was chosen to assess the potential for reversibility <b>of</b> effects by <b>prochloraz</b> on the sexual development of zebrafish (Danio rerio). Zebrafish were exposed to different concentrations <b>of</b> <b>prochloraz</b> (10 - 300 μg/L) until 60 days post hatch (dph), which includes the period of sexual differentiation. For the subsequent 40 days, fish were either held in clean water for depuration or under further continuous exposure. Histological investigations of the gonads revealed persistent effects on sexual differentiation. The sex ratio was skewed towards males and significantly more intersex individuals were found after exposure to prochloraz at 60 dph. No intersex fish, but masculinized sex ratios were still present after the depuration period, documenting that prochloraz irreversibly affects the sexual development of zebrafish...|$|R
