50|$|Errors in {{experience}} modifiers {{can occur}} if inaccurate information {{is reported to}} a <b>rating</b> <b>bureau</b> by a past insurer of an employer. Some states (Illinois and Tennessee) prohibit increases in experience modifiers once a workers compensation policy begins, even if the higher modifier has been correctly calculated under the rules. Most states allow increases in experience modifiers if done relatively early in the term of the workers compensation insurance policy, and most states prohibit increases in experience modifier late in the term of the policy.|$|E
50|$|The {{detailed}} rules governing calculation of experience modifiers are {{developed by the}} various <b>rating</b> <b>bureaus.</b> Although all states use similar methodology, there can be differences in details in the formulas used by independent <b>rating</b> <b>bureaus</b> and the NCCI.|$|R

50|$|Sisitsky was {{considered}} an expert on auto insurance. He was credited with creating the state Auto Insurance <b>Rating</b> <b>Bureau</b> and having auto insurance companies return $35 million in excess profits to Massachusetts drivers. He also sponsored legislation to compel insurance companies to include investment income in their calculations when making annual rate-increase requests and helped pass legislation to provide protective regulation for elderly people purchasing health insurance policies and prevent the arbitrary cancellation of homeowners insurance. When William M. Bulger became Senate President in 1978, he appointed Sisitsky to the Insurance Committee.|$|E

This paper describes how statewide or national loss exceedance curve output from a catastrophe model for workers compensation losses from terrorist attacks can be combined with insurance industry financial data in a basic model to estimate the financial impact on the United States workers compensation insurance industry. Many different metrics of impact on the industry are calculated for different percentile levels for the loss size of a single terrorist attack. The model is run with and without consideration of recoveries to insurers from the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) {{in order to assess}} the impact of this law on industry solvency. Qualitative results that indicate that TRIA does provide a very high level of protection to the industry are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Environments {{offering}} {{facilities to}} compose, on-demand, networked software services offered by multiple providers will require accounting {{systems that have}} the ability to charge for composed services in a manner reflecting the potentially complex business agreements between these providers. We present a two-phase rating process that allows rating engines generate charge information for dynamically composed services without having to have a priori knowledge of the structure of these services. In the first phase individual services comprising the composed service are rated as if they were executed standalone. In the second phase these interim charges are modified in line with providers' rules regarding whether monetary discounts or penalties should be applied when their services are used with other services. We discuss the ongoing implementation of this process {{in the context of an}} enhanced <b>Rating</b> <b>Bureau</b> Service and its deployment in the "Digital Business Ecosystem" environment...|$|E
40|$|Microfinance {{institutions}} (MFIs) play {{an important}} role in developing nations. The number of MFIs operating in Zimbabwe were gradually increasing against a background of unstable trends. The study sought to establish the factors that affect the sustainability of their growth. A descriptive survey research design was adopted. Out of the one hundred and seventy two MFIs which were operational in Harare, a sample of twenty three was used. The study participants comprised of middle managers, senior managers and the clients of the selected MFIs. The questionnaire was used as the main data collection tool. Literature was reviewed which looked mainly at other studies done in the related area. The study found that there were several factors that affected the sustainability of the growth of MFIs in Zimbabwe, some of them emanating mainly from the economic situation in the country. The study recommended the establishment of an effective credit <b>rating</b> <b>bureau,</b> suitable government policies, among others. The study recommended further studies to be done looking at the applicability of MFI lending models used in other countries to the Zimbabwean context...|$|E

40|$|The marked {{increase}} of IP-based services {{has resulted in}} the need for a more flexible rating process than the present 'flat-rate' accounting approach. This paper presents the design and development of a <b>Rating</b> <b>Bureau</b> Service for the IP telecommunications environment. It illustrates the architecture, information model, technologies, and standards used in development of the system, as well as expounding upon some of the key implementation goals. In the proposed rating environment, flexibility is achieved by decoupling the charging algorithm and the core rating system. Hence, algorithms can be changed independently of the core system, avoiding the need to recode and recompile. Algorithms can be swapped {{in and out of the}} system during rating, allowing a potentially limitless range of services to be rated by equal numbers of tailored algorithms. All algorithms in the system are spreadsheet-based. This approach moves the modelling and construction of algorithms from the programming domain into the business design arena. Anyone with a working knowledge of spreadsheets can effortlessly construct/update these arbitrarily complex charging algorithms. This paper focuses on the development of a fixed line call charging algorithm that may be employed by a large telecommunications company...|$|E

To do this, experience modifier calculations use loss information reported in by an employer's past insurers. This is compared to a calculation of expected losses for a company in that line of work, in that particular state, and adjusted for {{the size of the}} employer. The calculation of expected losses utilizes past audited payroll information for a particular employer, by classification code and state. These payrolls are multiplied by Expected Loss Rates, which are calculated by <b>rating</b> <b>bureaus</b> based on past reported claims costs per classification.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a {{detailed study of}} the structure, behavior, and performance of the property and liability insurance industry in the United States. This property insurance industry is shown to possess all of the structural characteristics normally associated with competitive markets. Despite a competitive market structure, however, the property-liability insurance industry has traditionally set prices through cartel-like <b>rating</b> <b>bureaus</b> and {{has been subjected to}} pervasive state rate regulation. The study concludes that the combination of state regulation, cartel pricing, and other legal peculiarities has resulted in the use of an inefficient sales technique, supply shortages, and over-capitalization. Free entry, however, tends to drive profits toward the cost of capital. Based on recent experience in states where the competitive market is used to determine insurance rates, the study suggests a movement away from rate regulation and cartel pricing to open competition, as a means of eliminating prevailing performance problems. ...|$|R
50|$|Original {{jurisdiction}} over workers' compensation claims has been diverted {{in much of}} the United States to administrative proceedings outside of the federal and state courts. They operate as no-fault schemes in which the employee need not prove the employer's fault; it is sufficient for the employee to prove that the injury occurred in the course of employment. If a third party other than the employer actually caused the injury, then the workers' compensation insurer (or self-insured employer) who is ordered to pay an employee's claim is usually entitled to initiate a subrogation action in the regular court system against the third party. In turn, workers' compensation insurance is regulated and underwritten separately from liability insurance. Just as the Insurance Services Office develops standard liability insurance forms and obtains approval for them from state insurance commissioners, the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI) and various state <b>rating</b> <b>bureaus</b> provide similar services in the workers' compensation context.|$|R

40|$|In {{spite of}} the efforts by {{government}} agencies, labor organizations, and researchers {{in the field of}} health and safety, injuries and fatalities continue to affect the construction industry. In 2002, the construction industry had the undesirable distinction of having two of the most dangerous occupations in the United States, with fatalities among structural steel workers at 58. 2 fatalities per 100, 000 workers (4 th highest rate) and construction laborers experiencing fatalities at the rate of 27. 7 fatalities per 100, 000 workers (9 th highest <b>rate)</b> (<b>Bureau</b> of Labor Statistics, 2002). In addition to the costs associated with construction accidents such as increased insurance premiums and medical expenses, loss of productivity is a cause for concern to the industry. For example, when a worker is injured, his/her productivity can decrease by 33 % during the first 48 hours following the occurrence of the injury (Coble et al. 2000). It has not been proven how unsafe working conditions affect worker productivity, and the impact of unsafe work practices on worker performance has not been quantified.
