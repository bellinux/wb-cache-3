40|$|The {{viscous flow}} field near {{the surface of a}} {{hovering}} rotor blade was studied for blade twist distributions typical of a till rotor blade and a conventional helicopter rotor blade. Three blade geometries were studied, including a tilt <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> distribution (baseline), conventional helicopter <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> distribution, and the baseline twist distribution with 2 deg of precone. The results give insight into the delayed stall phenomenon often observed for highly twisted rotors. Calculations were performed for a high thrust condition near stall using the thin-layer Navier-Stokes CFD code TURNS. Effects of built-in twist on section force coefficients, skin friction, velocities, surface pressures, and boundary layer shape factor are discussed. Although the rotor thrust coefficient was nominally the same for the cases using the two twist distributions, large differences were found in the section in-plane and normal force coefficients. These preliminary results imply that the blade outboard region, rather than the inboard region, provides the majority of the performance advantage of the baseline case over the low twist case. Skin friction, velocities near the blade, and surface pressures for the two twist distributions reveal significant differences in the blade outboard region...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this ongoing}} study is to develop and {{demonstrate}} the feasibility of a blade actuation system to dynamically change the twist, and/or the camber, of an airfoil section and, consequently, alter the in-flight aerodynamic loading on the blade for efficient flight control. The required analytical and finite element tools are under development to enable an accurate and comprehensive aeroelastic assessment of the current Full-Blade Warping and 3 D Warping Actuated Trailing Edge Flap concepts. The feasibility of the current concepts for swashplateless rotors and higher harmonic blade control is also being investigated. In particular, {{the aim is to}} complete the following objectives, some of which have been completed (as noted below) and others that are currently ongoing: i) Develop a Vlasov finite element model and validate against the ABAQUS shell models (completed). ii) Implement the 3 D warping actuation concept within the comprehensive analysis code DYMORE. iii) Perform preliminary aeroelastic simulations of blades using DYMORE with 3 D warping actuation: a) Investigate the blade behavior under 1 per/rev actuation. Determine whether sufficient twist can be generated and sustained to achieve primary blade control. b) Investigate the behavior of a trailing edge flap configuration under higher harmonic excitations. Determine how much twist can be obtained at the harmonics 2 - 5 per/rev. iv) Determine actuator specifications such as the power required, load and displacements, and identify the stress and strain distributions in the actuated blades. In general, the completion of Item ii) above will give an additional research capability in rotorcraft dynamics analyses, i. e., the capability to calculate the <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> due to warping, something that is not currently available in any of the existing comprehensive rotorcraft analyses...|$|E

40|$|Summary. [...] An {{experimental}} single-stage turbine {{designed for}} the testing {{of a variety of}} blade forms with cold air is described together with the instrumentation provided for test measurements. Performance results obtained on this unit from two <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> designs are presented and it is shown that for the incidence range covered by the tests an untwisted constant-section blade of about 10 per cent reaction possesses characteristics of pressure loss and deflection nearly identical to those of a conventional <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> <b>twisted</b> along its length to conform to the requirements of radial equilibrium, the mean diameter sections of the two blade designs being identical. It {{should be noted that the}} <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> section used in these tests provides a gas outlet angle and degree of reaction which, although lower than those employed in current aircraft engine practice, may well become typical for designs requiring a higher volumetric flow per unit turbine frontal area, e. g., a high temperature cooled turbine. 1.

40|$|<b>Rotor</b> <b>Blades,</b> {{especially}} active <b>twist</b> <b>blades,</b> {{have been}} investigated by DLR (German Aerospace Center) {{for many years and}} the feasibility of this technology was shown in several projects. However, many relevant features {{must be taken into account}} within the design process. The most challenging aspect is the proper tuning of the structure to integrate the fragile actuators, because they have to sustain a variety of loads, while still providing the expected performance. Further different constraints on bending and torsional stiffness or axes positions of the <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> exist. At DLR a tool called SaMaRA (Structural Modelling and Rotor Analysis) was developed.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a helicopter mainly depends {{on the design of}} the main rotor. Thus, the main <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> should have an optimised lift distribution for the most likely (favourable) flight conditions. They have to endure strong centrifugal and lift forces and should be able to transmit these loads to the rotor hub and therefore to the airframe. To design light weight <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> which could fulfil these requirements, the loads occurring under flight conditions and the resultant behaviour of the <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> (bend, <b>twist)</b> have to be known. The in-flight investigation of the deformation of the fast spinning rotor is a demanding task. It is evident, that conventional methods such as strain gauges and accelerometers are difficult to use because of problems with their installation, wiring, the data transmission, and the balancing of the propeller. Additionally, such sensors provide data only at the location where they have been installed. Consequently, a non-intrusive and planar measurement of the <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> deformation in flight is of high interest. This need for advanced, non-intrusive e. g. optical measurement techniques has been defined and goal-oriented scheduled as a task of the EC-funded specific targeted research project “AIM – Advanced In-flight Measurement Techniques”. DLR and Eurocopter Deutschland GmbH are applying the Quantitative Video Technique (QVT) together with the Image Pattern Correlation Technique (IPCT) to obtain the in-flight deformation of the main <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> of an EC- 135.

40|$|Variable {{rotor speed}} and {{variable}} <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> are combined to reduce rotor power and improve helicopter performance. Two modeling methods are respectively utilized. One {{is based on}} an empirical aerodynamic model and the other is based on CFD (computational fluid dynamics). The flight data of the UH- 60 A helicopter is used to validate the methods. The predictions of the rotor power by the empirical method are in good agreement with the test data and the CFD method, which verifies the application of present methods in analyzing helicopter performance. The analyses indicate that significant rotor power reduction can be achieved by decreasing rotor speed. It is not appropriate to decrease the rotor speed too much in high forward flight. More power reduction can be attained by varying rotor speed than by variable <b>blade</b> <b>twist.</b> The individual variation of <b>rotor</b> speed or <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> can reduce the rotor power by 17. 8 % or 10. 4 %, at a forward speed 250 km/h and weight coefficient of 0. 0065. A combination of rotor speed reduction and <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> can save 20. 9 %. The maximum power reduction increases with forward speed and then decreases. The optimal performance improvement occurs at the medium to high forward speed. With increasing takeoff weight, the benefit in power saving decreases.

40|$|For optimal rotor {{performance}} in a tiltrotor aircraft {{the difference in the}} inflow and the rotor speeds between the hover and cruise flight modes suggests different <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> and chord distributions. The <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> rates in current tiltrotor applications are defined based upon a compromise between the figure of merit in hover and propeller efficiency in airplane mode. However, when each operation mode is considered separately the optimum blade distributions are found to be considerably different. Passive <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> control, which uses the inherent variation in centrifugal forces on a <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> to achieve optimum <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> distributions in each flight mode through the use of extension-twist coupled composite <b>rotor</b> <b>blades,</b> has been considered for performance improvement of tiltrotor aircraft over the last two decades. The challenge for this concept is to achieve the desired twisting deformations in the <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> without altering the aeroelastic characteristics of the vehicle. A concept referred to as the sliding mass concept is proposed in this work in order to increase the twist change with rotor speed for a closed-cell composite <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> cross-section to practical levels for performance improvement in a tiltrotor aircraft. The concept is based on load path changes for the centrifugal forces by utilizing non-structural masses readily available on a conventional blade, such as the leading edge balancing mass. A multilevel optimization technique based on the simulated annealing method is applied to improve the performance of the XV 15 tiltrotor aircraft. A cross-sectional analysis tool, VABS together with a multibody dynamics code, DYMORE are integrated into the optimization process. The optimization results revealed significant improvements in the power requirement in hover while preserving cruise efficiency. It is also shown that about 21 % of the improvement is provided through the sliding mass concept pointing to the additional flexibility the concept provides for tailoring of the structure without any additional weight penalty on the system.

40|$|In {{the field}} of smart structures, piezoceramic {{actuators}} are wildly used for vibration reduction and acoustic manipulation of structures. Those applications typically run at frequencies between 10 Hz and 10 k Hz. Prominent examples are the piezoceramic actuators implemented in helicopter <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> to <b>twist</b> them dynamically for higher harmonic control (HHC) or individual blade control (IBC). Once the actuators are implemented {{it would be a}} great benefit to also use them to statically change the <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> (higher twist for take-off and landing - for higher lift; lower twist for high speed forward flight - for reduced drag). Staying with this example it can be found that sensing the twist displacement is not an easy task at all (see [1, 2]), so it would be most desirable, to use open loop control. In order to do that, the transfer function has to be known accurately. Unfortunately measurements show that the amplitudes for such very low frequencies behavior behave strongly non linear. This paper presents experimental results investigating the influence of the frequency on the amplitude - especially going for frequencies in the lower mHz region. A variety of piezoceramic actuators has been investigated: from stacks to patch type, d 33 as well as d 31 effect actuators. A second focus of this paper is the reaction of piezoceramic actuators on the application of a constant DC voltage. The drift that occurs has to be taken into consideration.

Numerical results indicate that useful amplitudes of nonresonant elastic twist, {{on the order of}} one to two degrees, are achievable under one-g hovering flight conditions for interdigitated electrode poling configurations. Twist actuation for the interdigitated electrode blades is also compared with the twist actuation of a conventionally poled piezoelectric fiber composite <b>blade.</b> Elastic <b>twist</b> produced using the interdigitated electrode actuators was found to be four to five times larger than that obtained with the conventionally poled actuators...|$|R
40|$|The {{present report}} gives {{an account of}} the Aerodynamic Design of a 500 W aero-generator rotor/blade for battery {{charging}} application. Based on the literature survey, conceptual design of the base line <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> was carried out. Aerofoils available in the open domain were surveyed and 16 aerofoils were chosen. Design of the shape of the <b>blade</b> (<b>twist</b> and chord) was carried out for each aerofoil. Analysis using GH-Bladed was done to predict the performance of the rotor for different operating conditions. Finally the performances were comparatively studied and four aerofoils were chosen for detailed investigation. The report concludes with the future works envisaged viz. prediction of the segmental loadings and structural design of the <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> and making fabrication drawings...|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} program {{dedicated to the}} development of an active, variable <b>twist</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> has recently been completed at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The main program goal was to develop a <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> for Higher Harmonic Control (HHC) and Individual Blade Control (IBC) applications. The structural concept incorporates a blade skin build from non-isotropic fiber material, and an integrated, tip-mounted, piezoelectric actuation device. The actuator's linear expansion is directly transformed into a rotational motion through the coupling of elongation and torsion deflections within the non-isotropic blade skin. This allows to directly control the <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> angle in the region of highest aerodynamic efficiency without the need for additional trailing edge flaps. Wind tunnel tests (non-rotating) and rotor tests were carried out to assess the twist performance under aerodynamic and centrifugal loads...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{potential}} benefits that fixed but deployable trailing-edge flaps may have on a low-twist hovering rotor using a blade-element method combined with two-dimensional and three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics. Low <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> is beneficial in terms of forward-flight performance, which, combined with a deployable flap, could also offer good hover performance, resulting in an overall better design in comparison with a plain <b>twisted</b> <b>blade.</b> To evaluate this concept, a parametric study of flap configurations was conducted using a simple blade-element method based on computational-fluid-dynamics-generated two-dimensional aerodynamics. This simple model indicated that up to 6 deg of <b>blade</b> <b>twist</b> could be recovered at high rotor thrust by using an optimized flap configuration. Performance improvements were also obtained for outboard slotted-flap configurations. The optimum slotted-flap designs were also evaluated using three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics, which confirmed that an inboard flap combined with a low-twist (7 deg) <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> matched {{the performance of a}} plain blade with - 13 deg of twist. A blended-flap configuration was also applied and evaluated. This simpler design demonstrated the equivalent performance of a clean rotor with 10 deg of <b>blade</b> <b>twist,</b> providing further evidence of the potential of the fixed inboard flap concept...|$|R
