5|$|As the American {{troops were}} {{attempting}} to destroy Shōji's force, Vandegrift ordered Carlson's raiders to march overland from Aola Bay toward Koli Point to cut off any of Shōji's forces that escaped the encirclement attempt. On 5 November, two transport ships headed for Espiritu Santo to pick up three companies from Carlson's battalion while Carlson prepared his two companies already on Guadalcanal to march overland towards Koli Point. Carlson arranged for <b>rear</b> <b>echelon</b> personnel at Aola to resupply his patrol with rations every four days at a prearranged point on the coast. A patrol with native carriers would meet the boat and manpack the supplies inland to Carlson's patrol base.|$|E
5|$|That evening, around 23:00, the 9th Infantry Battalion's <b>rear</b> <b>echelon</b> at Barara, {{along the}} Toko–Mosigetta–Buin Road, came under attack. Under {{the command of}} the {{battalion}} second-in-command, and possessing only four Bren light machine guns for direct fire support, they were nevertheless able to hold off the initial attack. Following this, sporadic fighting continued into the early morning, when at 04:45 on 29 March a force of about 100 Japanese attacked the position supported by sustained machine gun and rifle fire. Rushing the Australian position with bayonets, they were beaten back by stiff defence and fell back from the position, leaving behind 23 dead but taking their wounded with them. Four Australians were wounded in this encounter.|$|E
5|$|From 26 to 29 March, the division's 789th Regiment and the 143rd Rifle Brigade, with tank support, {{attacked}} the German strongpoint of Koy-Asan. The 789th advanced two kilometers, entered Koy-Asan, {{and opened fire}} on the railroad bridge. However, the Soviet troops were unable to completely take the strong point. On 31 March, Lvov ordered the army to transition to echeloned defense, and the 390th {{was placed in the}} <b>rear</b> <b>echelon.</b> Around this time, Zakian was mortally wounded by a shell fragment at his command post, and died on 2 April. Colonel Ivan Lyudnikov took command on 1 April, and seventeen days later was replaced by Colonel Hmayak Babayan. In late April the Chairman of the Presidium of the Armenian SSR Supreme Soviet, Matsak Papian, presented the division with a battle flag. Around this time, at the insistence of the Crimean Front commissar Lev Mekhlis, all troops were concentrated into one single defensive line with few reserves.|$|E

In May, the units of 80th AA Bde went to their marshalling areas to embark for the invasion. The assault elements of the regiment embarked at Portsmouth, the <b>rear</b> <b>echelons</b> at Tilbury.|$|R
50|$|If successful, {{such as at}} Inchon, such {{operations}} can be shattering, {{breaking into}} the lightly held <b>rear</b> <b>echelons</b> of an enemy, when its front line forces are committed elsewhere. Even when not entirely successful, for example at Anzio these operations can relieve pressure on troops on the main battle front, by forcing the enemy to divert resources to contain the new front.|$|R
5|$|Generalfeldmarschall Walter Model—commander of Army Group B—had {{moved his}} {{headquarters}} to Arnhem and was re-establishing defences {{in the area}} and co-ordinating the reorganisation of the scattered units so that by the time the Allies launched Market Garden there would be several units opposing them. To the west of Arnhem was Kampfgruppe Von Tettau, a force equivalent to seven battalions made up of all manner of German units (including Das Heer, Luftwaffe, Kriegsmarine, <b>rear</b> <b>echelon</b> and Waffen-SS troops) under the command of General Hans von Tettau at Grebbeberg. This included the SS Non-commissioned officer school SS Unteroffizierschule Arnheim and the 16th SS Training Battalion under the command of SS Sturmbannführer Sepp Krafft whose unit would {{play a crucial role in}} the opening phases of the battle. Within Arnhem itself, the town garrison was under the command of Major-General Friedrich Kussin.|$|E
5|$|No.1 Wing was {{restructured}} from July 1944. On 1July, No.452 and No.457 Squadrons {{were transferred}} to No. 80 Wing RAAF, which had been formed to conduct offensive operations in the NEI {{under the command of}} Clive Caldwell. They were replaced by two British units; No.548 and No.549 Squadrons RAF. This put the wing in a unique position: all of its flying squadrons were now British units. The new RAF squadrons had been formed in Australia, {{as a result of a}} further meeting between H.V. Evatt and Winston Churchill in July 1943, at which Evatt had requested additional RAF units. They were formed from British pilots and Australian ground crew at Lawnton, Queensland on 15December 1943 but did not receive their Mark VIII Spitfires until April the next year. No.548 Squadron was initially stationed at Livingstone Airfield, and its air echelon arrived there on 10 June after a flight in which four Spitfires made forced landings when they ran low on fuel. No. 549Squadron's air echelon arrived at Strauss Airfield on 16 June and its <b>rear</b> <b>echelon</b> completed its movement from Queensland on 14 July. On 20July, two No.54 Squadron Spitfires operating out of Truscott Airstrip shot down a Dinah. This was the last Japanese aircraft to be destroyed over Northern Australia.|$|E

25|$|On 1 November {{the group}} was {{designated}} for movement to Kyushu, to be based at Itazuke Air base near Fukuoka {{as part of the}} Far East Air Forces occupation force. On 7 November the group divided into advance and <b>rear</b> <b>echelons</b> and began loading five LSTs for the movement. The convoy sailed on 13 November, offloading at Sasebo by 22 November (it was unable to unload at Fukuoka because the harbor had not been swept of naval mines). On 25 November the aircraft flew from Okinawa to Ashiya Air Base because Itazuke was not yet serviceable. Their crews were trucked 40 miles to Itazuke, followed two days later by the <b>rear</b> air <b>echelon,</b> which arrived in 18 C-47s. The 38th BG began rehabilitation of the base using groups of Japanese laborers.|$|R
50|$|The Hedgehog defence is a {{military}} tactic in which a defending army creates mutually supporting strongpoints in a defence in depth {{which is designed to}} sap the strength and break the momentum of an attacking army. The strongpoints are designed to be expensive for an attacker to assault, and although the defending positions can be bypassed, and are indeed designed to be bypassed, doing so exposes the attacker's <b>rear</b> <b>echelons</b> and line of communications to counterattack.|$|R
25|$|The Red Army made a {{major effort}} to feed the {{residents}} of the city which began on Colonel-General Nikolai Berzarin's orders.

50|$|The most ferocious {{battle to}} regain Corregidor {{occurred}} at Wheeler Point {{on the night}} of 18 February and early the next morning, when D and F Companies, 2nd Battalion, 503rd PRCT, settled down in defensive positions near Battery Hearn and Cheney Trail. At 22:30 under a black, moonless night, 500 Japanese marines came out of the Battery Smith armory and charged the American and the Philippine positions. (This was also the night Pvt. McCarter earned his Medal of Honor). F Company stopped the attacks by the Japanese trying to break through to the south.

25|$|The Triplane's combat {{career was}} {{comparatively}} brief, {{in part because}} the Triplane proved difficult to repair. The fuel and oil tanks were inaccessible without dismantling the wings and fuselage. Even relatively minor repairs had to be made at <b>rear</b> <b>echelon</b> repair depots. Spare parts became difficult to obtain during the summer of 1917, resulting in the reduction of No. 1 Naval Squadron's complement from 18 to 15 aircraft.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1944, 120th LAA Rgt moved to Southend-on-Sea, where in late March it received nine Crusader AA Mark I tracked self-propelled (SP) Bofors guns, which would have a special role in the assault landing on D-Day. In addition, 76th AA Brigade assigned 1618 LAA Rgt Platoon of 323rd Company, Royal Army Service Corps (RASC), to the regiment to provide mobility. In March the regiment moved back to Southampton for exercises, where it remained until May, when the units required for the assault phase of Overlord began to gather in southern England. 120th LAA Rgt was already at Southampton {{while the rest of}} the brigade (including the <b>rear</b> <b>echelons</b> of 120th LAA Rgt) concentrated at Southend.|$|R
