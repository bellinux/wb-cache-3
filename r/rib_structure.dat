2500|$|The {{majority}} of glued joints in the instrument use animal hide glue rather than common white glue {{for a number}} of reasons. Hide glue is capable of making a thinner joint than most other glues, it is reversible (brittle enough to crack with carefully applied force, and removable with very warm water) when disassembly is needed, and since fresh hide glue sticks to old hide glue, more original wood can be preserved when repairing a joint. (More modern glues must be cleaned off entirely for the new joint to be sound, which generally involves scraping off some wood along with the old glue.) Weaker, diluted glue is usually used to fasten the top to the ribs, and the nut to the fingerboard, since common repairs involve removing these parts. The purfling running {{around the edge of the}} spruce top provides some protection against cracks originating at the edge. It also allows the top to flex more independently of the <b>rib</b> <b>structure.</b> Painted-on [...] purfling on the top is usually a sign of an inferior instrument. The back and ribs are typically made of maple, most often with a matching striped figure, referred to as flame, fiddleback, or tiger stripe.|$|E

50|$|The {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage of Oxford uses {{an arrangement}} of spruce longerons and stiffeners underneath a plywood exterior. It is constructed in two sections on separate jigs, divided between the front and rear, these are joined together at the rear bulkhead. The forward bulkhead is deliberately reinforced so that the structure is capable of withstanding {{the impact of the}} aircraft turning over during landing {{in the hands of an}} unfortunate trainee pilot. Both the elevator and fin of the tail unit used a wooden spar and <b>rib</b> <b>structure</b> covered by fabric. The fuselage can be partially dismantled, the wing dividing into three separate sections, so that it can be road-transported. The wing uses a stressed-skin ply-covered structure using spruce flanges and ply webs.

The wings are outfitted with hydraulically-operated split flaps, which extend between the ailerons.|$|E

5000|$|Typically the top (also {{known as}} the belly or table, in the U.K.) -- the instrument's soundboard) is made of quarter-sawn spruce, bookmatched at a {{strongly}} glued joint down the center, with two sound-holes (or [...] "f-holes", from their resemblance to a stylized letter [...] "f") precisely placed between the C-bouts and lower corners. The sound-holes affect the flex patterns of the top, or table, and allow the box to breathe as it vibrates. A decorative inlaid set of three narrow wooden strips, usually a light-colored strip surrounded by two dark strips, called purfling, runs {{around the edge of}} the top, and is said to give some resistance to cracks originating at the edge. It is also claimed to allow the top to flex more independently of the <b>rib</b> <b>structure.</b> Some instruments have two lines of purfling, or have knot-work type ornaments inlaid in the back. Painted-on [...] purfling on the top is usually a sign of an inferior instrument. A slab-sawn bass bar fitted inside the top, running lengthwise under the bass foot of the bridge, gives added mass and rigidity to the top plate. Some cheaper mass-produced violins have an integral bass bar, carved from the same piece as the top. Ideally the top is glued to the ribs and linings with slightly diluted hide glue, to allow future removal with minimal damage.|$|E

The first, introduced by Schreckenberg and Joswig, 1 uses the hough transform to find rib borders, the second one uses a synergetic classifier to estimate the matching between rib edge templates and rib borders. The last one, the sinking lead algorithm, gives the best classification results by performing a matched template technique in combination with partial methods from the former two algorithms.

To achieve the required power-law decrease in sound velocity with propagation distance the inhomogeneous acoustic waveguides earlier proposed by Mironov and Pislyakov (2002) and made of quasi-periodic <b>ribbed</b> <b>structures</b> materialising walls of variable impedance have been used. Two different samples of acoustic black holes formed by these <b>ribbed</b> <b>structures</b> have been manufactured to provide linear and quadratic decreases in acoustic wave velocity with distance.

Measurements of the reflection coefficients for guided acoustic modes incident on the black holes have been carried out in the frequency range of 100 - 1000 Hz. The results show the possibility of significant reduction in the acoustic reflection without using additional absorbing materials. However, contrary to the expectations, the introduction of absorbing materials did not cause further noticeable reduction in the sound reflection coefficients...|$|R

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{conversion}} efficiency of Si solar cells, {{we have developed}} a thin Si wafer-based solar cell that uses a <b>rib</b> <b>structure.</b> The open-circuit voltage of a solar cell is known to increase with deceasing wafer thickness if the cell is adequately passivated. However, {{it is not easy}} to handle very thin wafers because they are brittle and are subject to warpage. We fabricated a lattice-shaped <b>rib</b> <b>structure</b> on the rear side of a thin Si wafer to improve the wafer’s strength. A silicon nitride film was deposited on the Si wafer surface and patterned to form a mask to fabricate the lattice-shaped rib, and the wafer was then etched using KOH to reduce the thickness of the active area, except for the rib region. Using this structure in a Si heterojunction cell, we demonstrated that a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) could be obtained by thinning the wafer without sacrificing its strength. A wafer with thickness of 30 μm was prepared easily using this structure. We then fabricated Si heterojunction solar cells using these rib wafers, and measured their implied VOC as a function of wafer thickness. The measured values were compared with device simulation results, and we found that the measured VOC agrees well with the simulated results. To optimize the rib and cell design, we also performed device simulations using various wafer thicknesses and rib dimensions...|$|E
