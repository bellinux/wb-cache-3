50|$|The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>demurrage</b> (if any) is {{generally}} accepted as {{the measure of}} the damages for detention, but is not necessarily the true measure. When the claim is for detention and not demurrage the actual loss is recoverable, which may be more or may be less than the agreed <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>demurrage.</b> The contract usually doesn't count Sundays and holidays as lay days—but unless expressly stipulated, this exception does not apply after the lay days have expired.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluated the}} demurrage policies and charges of selected shipping companies and terminal operators in the Lagos ports {{and the implications}} {{in the economy and}} shipping industry in Nigeria. It adopted the survey approach to gather data from the dominant container operators (carriers) and the terminal operators. Demurrage duration and categorization of the demurrage periods and charges for each period by the selected operators were collected and compared using the statistical tool of analysis of variance to determine if there are differences among the charges and charging systems. It was found that, significant differences do not exist in the average <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>demurrage</b> charges per container per day among the shipping companies and terminal operators in Lagos seaports. The study also found that there is {{no significant difference in the}} average amount charged as demurrage among the shipping companies and terminal operators in the three differing periods of demurrage duration in Lagos ports, Nigeria. It was recommended among other things that, the Nigerian shippers’ council as the governmental body responsible for freight regulation and protection of shippers 2 ̆ 7 interest should by policy fix a uniform container demurrage rate for all terminal operators and carriers operating in Nigeria...|$|E

50|$|In other cases, if {{the vessel}} is {{detained}} beyond the fixed number <b>of</b> <b>demurrage</b> days, the ship owner can recover damages for detention. Sometimes the charter-party defines no fixed time for loading or discharging. In such cases the charter-party is obligated to load or discharge {{as quickly as}} possible. If loading or discharging is not done in a reasonable time, the shipowner can claim damages for detention.|$|R
50|$|Some {{complementary}} currencies {{take advantage}} <b>of</b> <b>demurrage</b> fees, an intentional {{devaluation of the}} currency over time, like negative interest. This stimulates market exchanges in the devaluating currency, propagates new participation in the currency system and forces the storage of wealth (hoarding) ability usually reserved for currency into more permanent and better value holding tools like property, improvement, education, technology, health, equity securities, etc. - {{all of which are}} sheltered from the currency-based demurrage fees.|$|R
50|$|Unlike inflation, {{demurrage}} gradually reduces {{only the}} value of currency held: it functions as a negative interest (a tax) on currency held versus inflation that also reduces {{the value of}} savings or retirement funds and increases CPI. A positive interest rate is a subsidy. Both inflation and demurrage reduce the purchasing power of money held over time, but demurrage does so through fixed regular fees, while inflation does it {{in a variety of}} ways. Inflation is certainly not always everywhere a monetary phenomenon. Inflation is not always easy to predict & it does not stay fixed through time, but the level <b>of</b> <b>demurrage</b> is fixed by the Government.|$|R

50|$|Demurrage-charged local {{currency}} was successfully {{tested in the}} Austrian town of Wörgl between 1932 and 1934, as a tax collected {{for the benefit of}} the unemployed, until the Austrian central bank stopped the experiment. Similarly, in 1936, the Social Credit Party-led government in Alberta, Canada, introduced prosperity certificates in an attempt to alleviate the effects of the Great Depression, with holders having to affix to the back of a certificate a 1-cent stamp before the end of every week, for the certificate to maintain its validity. Local scrip systems, many <b>of</b> which incorporated <b>demurrage</b> fees, were also used across the United States during the Great Depression, and the Bankhead-Pettengill bill of 17 February 1933 was introduced in Congress to institutionalize such a system at the national level under the US Treasury, as documented in Irving Fisher's book Stamp Scrip. Bernard Lietaer also documents in his book Mysterium Geld the use <b>of</b> <b>demurrage</b> currency systems in Europe's High Middle Ages' bracteate systems and ancient Egypt's ostraka - dated receipts for the storage of grain - and credits these currency systems with the prosperity of those societies.|$|R
50|$|In principle, {{it can be}} {{considered}} that the similarity between vessel demurrage and container demurrage is correct since both refer to the same concept, which is the late return of equipment supplied by one party to another {{for the purpose of}} carrying a cargo. However, the actual regime <b>of</b> container <b>demurrage</b> is still to be determined precisely.|$|R
40|$|Bulk {{commodity}} export terminals {{are equipped}} with very expensive infrastructure. The massive capital outlay also is accompanied by large operating costs associated with major equipment such as shiploaders, reclaimers, and unloading stations. The port management is always interested in optimizing the deployment of its infrastructure {{with a view to}} minimizing the terminal's operating costs. This study deals with finding an optimal solution to an interesting situation where using one shiploader results in unacceptable ship waiting times and a high level <b>of</b> <b>demurrage,</b> whereas continuous deployment of two shiploaders results in inefficiency and high operating costs. This paper describes an approach for developing a strategy that considers a trade-off between the ship waiting cost and the cost of deploying the additional shiploader and results in the optimal deployment of resources. The approach is an integration of simulation, scenario building, and economic fundamentals. An actual bulk export terminal in Australia is used to demonstrate the applicability of this approach in assisting the port management in rational decision making...|$|R
50|$|The case {{involved}} {{the charter of}} a ship for two years’ consecutive voyages between US and Europe. The ship was to be loaded at a specified rate. The owners were to be paid according {{to the number of}} voyages made during the two-year period. If the time taken for loading and unloading was longer than required, the charterers were to pay $1000 per day by way <b>of</b> <b>demurrage.</b> The charterers were taking many extra days in loading and unloading but were allowed to continue to have the use of the ship {{for the remainder of the}} two years. Eight round trips were made. However, the owners alleged that the charterers delay in loading and unloading had made a further six trips impossible and sued for damages. The owners claimed that they were not bound by that clause because the charterers by their extraordinary delays had committed a fundamental breach of the contract.|$|R

40|$|Demurrage {{is a form}} of {{compensation}} due to violation of the time of loading and unloading cargo and usually stated in the lease contract <b>of</b> cooperation. <b>Demurrage</b> can sometimes cause a loss in the seller because it will increase the total cost of transportation.

40|$|A {{great deal}} of trouble is taken, by {{draftsman}} of voyage charterparties, to apportion risks of delay between owners and charterers at loading and discharge. Care must be taken over the commencement of laytime, {{the circumstances in which}} notice of readiness can be tendered, and exceptions and interruptions to laytime and <b>demurrage.</b> The complexities <b>of</b> <b>demurrage</b> alone have been judicially described as 'hideous': and no doubt the same sentiments can equally apply to laytime. This careful apportionment of delay risk can be entirely upset if the delay occurs before laytime is triggered. If charterers are held to have committed a breach of an independent term, preventing the laytime from running, damages will be for detention and neither layime nor demurrage provisions will be triggered. Charterers will lose the benefit of their laytime, and neither side will enjoy the convenience of the liquidated damages provided by the demurrage regime. This article considers two problems in this regard which could arise from recent decisions of the courts; first, the widening of safe port and safe berth obligations to encompass delay, and secondly, the implication of such terms into charterparties. Whatever view may be taken of these developments generally, neither is desirable in the contect of careful risk apportionment. To date, the courts have to some extent embraced the first, while fortunately restricting the second...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} about the Challenges behind Ineffective Customs Clearance of Goods at Sea Port {{a case study of}} Medical Stores Dar Es Salaam. Most of the drugs and medical {{supplies}} are procured by MSD from oversea suppliers through international tenders as per threshold set by PPA, 2004. All imported goods are subject to customs clearance at the port of entry in every destination country. Delay in customs clearing of goods causes to emerge and increase <b>of</b> <b>demurrage</b> costs and lack of essential drugs. Basing {{on the fact that the}} main objective of each organization is cost reduction and profit maximization, the situation at MSD contravened this fact, the researcher ought to assess the existing challenges in clearing process leading to the increasing of costs through such delays. The Research methodology concerned about data collection where the researcher was applying systematic approaches in data collection so as come up with the specific findings. The researcher used both qualitative and quantitative methods to find the challenges behind ineffective customs clearance activities of sea port consignments. The study used 33 respondents using purposive and convenience sampling techniques, and methods of data collection (primary data and secondary data) as tables were drawn by used special program known as SPSS. The findings revealed that, among major challenges come as the results of clearance procedures in Tanzania being too long, surrounded with corruption environment due to multiple documentation requirements, and the procedures are neither transparent enough nor documented. At MSD, it was revealed that there is small number of clearing staffs compared to the tasks and the long payment procedures were some source of the problems. Basing on the findings, it was recommended that, MSD should increase the number of clearing staffs and should consider using pre-payment procedures by depositing amount of money in advance to ease clearing process...|$|R
