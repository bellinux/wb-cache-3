5|$|Phylogenetic <b>{{reconstruction}}</b> <b>and</b> ancestral state reconstruction proceed {{by assuming}} that evolution has occurred without convergence. Convergent patterns may, however, appear {{at higher levels}} in a phylogenetic <b>reconstruction,</b> <b>and</b> are sometimes explicitly sought by investigators. The methods applied to infer convergent evolution depend on whether pattern-based or process-based convergence is expected. Pattern-based convergence is the broader term, for when two or more lineages independently evolve patterns of similar traits. Process-based convergence is when the convergence is due to similar forces of natural selection.|$|E

Cotton remains a primary export, although exact figures are not available. Rehabilitation of Cotontchad, a major cotton company weakened by a decline in world cotton prices, has been financed by France, the Netherlands, the European Union, and the International Bank for <b>Reconstruction</b> <b>and</b> Development (IBRD). The parastatal is now expected to be privatised. Other than Cotton, Cattle and Gum Arabic are dominant.|$|E
5|$|Highway72 {{was built}} as a trunk route by 1920, and became a provincial highway in 1937.

The project included the <b>reconstruction</b> <b>and</b> reworking of exit7 off Route4, which was a southbound-only exit serving both Route403 and Route402 when constructed. The exit was converted into a trumpet interchange with new ramps between Route4, Route403 and Route402 and was completed in December 2008, one year ahead of schedule. The project included {{the construction of a}} new northbound exit7 serving Route403 east.|$|E

Understanding multicellular metabolism is far from trivial and ‘omics’ data are difficult to interpret {{in the absence of a}} systems framework. ‘Omics’ data appropriately integrated with genome-scale <b>reconstructions</b> <b>and</b> modelling facilitates our understanding of how individual components interact and influence overall cell, tissue or organisms function. Here we present examples of how plant metabolic <b>reconstructions</b> <b>and</b> modelling are used as a systems-based framework for improving our understanding of the plant metabolic processes in single cells and multiple tissues...|$|R
