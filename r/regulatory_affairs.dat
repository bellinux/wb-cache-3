500|$|In February 1996, Ranariddh {{expressed}} concern over repeated {{delays in the}} construction of the resort-cum-casino complex at Sihanoukville, for which he had signed an agreement with Ariston in January 1995. Ariston blamed the lack of a governmental authority in Sihanoukville for the delay. At the end of April 1996, the government formed the Sihanoukville Developmental Authority (SDA) to oversee <b>regulatory</b> <b>affairs</b> and facilitate development. [...] At a conference in May 1996, [...] Ranariddh charged that CPP-controlled ministries were deliberately delaying the paperwork needed to complete the approval of Ariston's project. According to Tioulong Saumura, the former deputy governor of Cambodia's Central Bank (and Sam Rainsy's wife), the delays were part of Hun Sen's strategy to undermine projects associated with Ranariddh. In an apparent act of retaliation, Ranariddh directed FUNCINPEC's co-minister of the interior, You Hockry to close down all casinos in the country, citing the absence of authorising legislation. Ranariddh also proposed the cancellation of Ariston's contracts due to the delays. Hun Sen responded by meeting with Mahathir, and assured him that agreements which Ranariddh had previously approved would be honoured.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Dupilumab (REGN 668 /SAR 231893), {{produced}} by a collaboration between Regeneron and Sanofi, is a monoclonal antibody currently in phase III for moderate-to-severe asthma. Dupilumab is directed against the α-subunit of the interleukin (IL) - 4 receptor and blocks the IL- 4 and IL- 13 signal transduction. Areas Covered Pathophysiological role of IL- 4 and IL- 13 in asthma; mechanism of action of dupilumab; pharmacology of IL- 4 receptor; phase I and phase II studies with dupilumab; <b>regulatory</b> <b>affair.</b> Expert opinion Patients with severe asthma who are not sufficiently controlled with standard-of-care represent the target asthma population for dupilumab. If confirmed, efficacy of dupilumab in both eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic severe asthma phenotype might represent an advantage over approved biologics for asthma, including omalizumab, mepolizumab, and reslizumab. Head-to-head studies to compare dupilumab versus other biologics with different mechanism of action are required. Pediatric studies with dupilumab are currently lacking and should be undertaken to assess efficacy and safety of this drug in children with severe asthma. The lack of preclinical data and published results of the completed four phase I studies precludes a complete assessment of the pharmacological profile of dupilumab. Dupilumab seems to be generally well tolerated, but large studies are required to establish its long-term safety and tolerability...|$|R
