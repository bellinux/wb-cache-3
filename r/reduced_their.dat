5|$|All major {{forecasting}} agencies predicted an above-average season. All <b>reduced</b> <b>their</b> seasonal predictions {{in early}} August, {{but even the}} revised predictions were too high. The lack of activity was primarily caused by an unexpected significant weakening of the Atlantic Ocean thermohaline circulation between winter and spring. This resulted in continuation of the spring weather pattern over the Atlantic Ocean, with strong vertical wind shear, mid-level moisture, and atmospheric stability, which suppressed tropical cyclogenesis.|$|E

It entered clinical practice in 1967 and brought about a revolution in the management of PD. By the late 1980s deep brain stimulation introduced by Alim Louis Benabid and colleagues at Grenoble, France, emerged as a possible treatment.|$|E

After Burebista's death the kingdom was divided into four parts ruled by the religious elite. By the time of Augustus Dacia broke further down into five parts.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages, Capetian Kings of France {{chose to}} have their heirs {{apparent}} crowned during their own lifetime {{in order to avoid}} succession disputes. This practice was later adopted by Angevin Kings of England, Kings of Hungary and other European monarchs. From the moment of their coronation, the heirs were regarded as junior kings (rex iunior), but they exercised little power and historically {{were not included in the}} numbering of monarchs if they predeceased their fathers. The nobility disliked this custom, as it <b>reduced</b> <b>their</b> chances to benefit from a possible succession dispute.|$|E

40|$|The {{existing}} literature shows driving speed significantly affects levels of safety, emissions, and stress in driving. In addition, drivers who feel tense when driving {{have been found}} to drive more slowly than others. These findings were mostly obtained from crash data analyses or field studies, and less is known regarding driver perceptions {{of the extent to which}} <b>reducing</b> <b>their</b> driving speed would improve road safety, <b>reduce</b> <b>their</b> car’s emissions, and reduce stress and road rage. This paper uses ordered probit regression models to analyse responses from 3538 Queensland drivers who completed an online RACQ survey. Drivers most strongly agreed that <b>reducing</b> <b>their</b> driving speed would improve road safety, less strongly agreed that <b>reducing</b> <b>their</b> driving speed would <b>reduce</b> <b>their</b> car’s emissions and least strongly agreed that <b>reducing</b> <b>their</b> driving speed would reduce stress and road rage. Younger drivers less strongly agreed that these benefits would occur than older drivers. Drivers of automatic cars and those who are bicycle commuters agreed more to these benefits than other drivers. Female drivers agreed more strongly than males on improving safety and reducing stress and road rage. Type of fuel used, engine size, driving experience, and distance driven per week were also found to be associated with driver perceptions, although these were not found to be significant in all of the regression models. The findings from this study may help in developing targeted training or educational measures to improve drivers’ willingness to <b>reduce</b> <b>their</b> driving speed...|$|R

5|$|The {{construction}} of the railway introduced new tensions {{between the government and}} the First Nations.

The order of the SM53-series from Høka gave Oslo Sporveier sufficient stock to operate the street lines, and from 1952 to 1957, the company transferred the 19 trams to Bærumsbanen. Here, they were given the designation Class E. No. 163 was in too bad condition to be used on the line, and was retired. In October 1949, no. 184 caught fire and was taken out of service.

Hundreds of ships arrived in Pusan each month, starting with 230 in July and increasing steadily thereafter.
