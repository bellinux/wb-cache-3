40|$|In {{everyday}} decision making, {{people often}} face decisions with outcomes that differ on multiple dimensions. The tradeoff in preferences between magnitude <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> delay to <b>reinforcement,</b> and probability <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> {{is a fundamental}} concern in the decision making literature. Yet, the relative impacts <b>of</b> probability <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> delay to <b>reinforcement,</b> and magnitude <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> have not been studied together even though researchers have been advocating for the combined study of these variables for decades. The proposed project was designed to determine the relative impacts <b>of</b> magnitude <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> and probability <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> {{when they were both}} increasing over a 10 s delay to maximum charge. A first-person shooter video game was adapted for the study of choice when outcome magnitude and probability <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> were increasing either simultaneously (Experiment 1) or separately (Experiment 2) over a 10 s delay. Experiment 1 showed that participants waited longer to ensure a greater probability <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> than to ensure a greater magnitude <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> The results <b>of</b> Experiment 2 indicated that probability <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> had a stronger impact on behavior than magnitude <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> when they were increasing separately. These experiments indicated that probability <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> outweighed magnitude <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> by a ratio of approximately 3 : 1...|$|R

5|$|A new bow type, {{in which}} bone {{reinforcements}} cover {{the handle of}} the bow as well as the tips, may have developed in Central Asia during the 3rd to 2nd century BCE, with earliest finds from the area of Lake Baikal.

Such bows with <b>reinforcement</b> <b>of</b> both grip and siyahs have been called “Hun,” “Hunnic” or “Hsiung-nu” composite bows. Huns did use such bows, but so did many other peoples; Rausing termed this type the 'Qum-Darya Bow' from the Han Chinese type-site at the frontier post of Loulan, {{at the mouth of the}} Qum Darya river, dated by analogy between c. 1st century BCE and the 3rd century CE.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Duigan desired command of the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF), which was to be raised for service in Europe. Lack of command experience and his performance as CGS meant that he was not a popular choice within the military or the New Zealand Government. Major General Bernard Freyberg was instead appointed commander of 2NZEF, and Duigan's term as CGS was extended. Throughout 1940, Duigan worked to ensure the continued support and <b>reinforcement</b> <b>of</b> 2NZEF, and oversaw the reintroduction of conscription. He also attended defence conferences in Singapore and India, and made tours of the 2NZEF while it was in the Middle East.|$|E

Junior commanders felt that Mackay {{should have been more}} forceful, and should have enlisted the help of his superior, Blamey, at an earlier stage. Blamey agreed with them, feeling that his old colleague was slowing down, and no longer possessed the vigour required for the campaign in New Guinea. Mackay left New Guinea in November 1943, handing over command of New Guinea Force to Lieutenant General Sir Leslie Morshead, and on 20 January 1944 Mackay relinquished command of Second Army and New Guinea Force.|$|E

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{quantifying}} local bond splitting behavior with lateral confinement in reinforced concrete (RC) members, pull-out bond test was carried out with lateral confinement force varied according to slippage <b>of</b> main <b>reinforcement.</b> The experimental factors are concrete strength, diameter <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> and proportional coefficient of confinement force.
