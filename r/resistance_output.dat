40|$|A {{model was}} {{developed}} to simulate weed emergence patterns after soil cultivation. In the model, the consecutive processes of dormancy release, germination and pre-emergence growth were modelled in separate modules. Input variables of the model were: date of soil cultivation, soil temperature and soil penetration <b>resistance.</b> <b>Output</b> variables of the model were: seedling density and timing of seedling emergence. The model was parameterized for Polygonum persicaria, Chenopodium album and Spergula arvensis with data from previous field and laboratory experiments. The model was evaluated with data from an experiment, in which emergence of P. persicaria, C. album and S. arvensis was monitored in field plots that were cultivated once only, at one of five dates in the spring. At {{the same time as}} the field observations on seedling emergence, seasonal changes in seed dormancy of the buried weed seeds were assessed by testing the germination of seed lots that were buried in envelopes. From a comparison between field observations and simulated data, it appeared that the model overestimated the rate of dormancy release in spring, whereas germination and pre-emergence growth were simulated well. In general, therefore, both the numbers of emerging seedlings and the timing of emergence could be predicted accurately, when dormancy was not simulated but introduced from experimental data. Improvement of predictions of field emergence of weeds should mainly focus on increasing the precision of the simulation of dormancy release. Close correlations were found between seedbed temperature and both the extent and rate of seedling emergence, but analysis with the simulation model revealed that they were only partly based on causal relationships, so that they have limited predictive value...|$|E
40|$|The ISO Thermal Manikin Working Group {{has been}} tasked {{to assess the}} {{suitability}} to include thermal manikins in the standard for the current immersion suit approval testing. Five international laboratories {{were involved in a}} round robin test to measure the thermal resistance of immersion suits. The objectives are (1) to assess the uniformity of thermal resistance of suits derived from different manikins, to attempt to quantify the errors caused by methodology, tools and calculation methods; and (2) to evaluate the difference in thermal <b>resistance</b> <b>output</b> between manikin and human for the same immersion suit. The results of the tests conducted at National Research Council Canada, Institute for Ocean Technology (NRC-IOT) are documented in this report. In air, the thermal resistance of a manikin wearing only test clothing was determined to be 1. 408 clo. The thermal resistance of a manikin wearing a non-insulated immersion suit and an insulated suit, with SOLAS RTD lifejacket over test clothing were 2. 442 clo and 2. 574 clo, respectively. In water, under uniform cooling conditions, the thermal resistance for a non-insulated immersion suit and an insulated immersion suit were 0. 532 clo and 1. 355 clo, respectively. Under non-uniform cooling conditions, the results can be up to 25 % different from those conducted in uniform cooling conditions. It is concluded that under uniform cooling conditions, the constant temperature control mode of thermal manikins and the parallel method can be used to determine thermal resistance. Further research and development are needed before thermal manikins could be used with confidence for suit evaluation under non-uniform cooling conditions.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{evaluating}} {{the performance of}} dynamic element matching in digital-to-analog converters, when the unit conversion cells of the converter have finite <b>output</b> <b>resistance.</b> The main goal of this thesis is to see {{the effect of the}} non-linearity introduced in the digital-to-analog converter's output, by the finite value of the <b>output</b> <b>resistance</b> and the mismatches in it and to realize if this non-linearity can be corrected by using the DEM encoder. This thesis considers the tree DEM encoder which is well known, in the literature, to be effective against amplitude and timing mismatches among different conversion cells. The available literature however doesn't consider the impact of finite <b>output</b> <b>resistance.</b> This thesis theorizes that since the DEM encoder scrambles the conversion cell order to correct the non-linearities, it will be ineffective against the <b>output</b> <b>resistance</b> as it is common to all the conversion cells. However, in the presence of <b>output</b> <b>resistance</b> mismatches, which exist between different conversion cells, DEM is again able to shape their non-linearity by scrambling.
