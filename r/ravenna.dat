5|$|During {{his year}} of consulship in 519 {{relations}} with the East Roman Empire flourished and the Acacian schism between the Eastern and Western Christian churches was ended. Whilst Eutharic was nominally a statesman, politician and soldier of the Roman Empire, {{he was also an}} Arian, whose views clashed with the Catholic majority; as consul enforcing Theoderic's tolerant policy towards the Jewish people, he incurred resentment from the local Catholics, whose traditions were less than tolerant. Following disturbances in <b>Ravenna,</b> where Catholics burnt down a number of synagogues, Eutharic's siding with the Jewish people of <b>Ravenna</b> was reported with resentment in a fragmentary contemporary chronicle.|$|E
5|$|Rather {{than going}} to war, Helmichis, Rosamund and their {{followers}} escaped to <b>Ravenna,</b> the capital of Byzantine Italy, where they were received with full honours by the authorities. Once in <b>Ravenna,</b> Rosamund was persuaded by the Byzantine prefect Longinus to kill Helmichis {{in order to be}} free to marry him. Rosamund proceeded to poison Helmichis, but the latter, having understood what his wife had done to him, forced her to drink the cup too, so both of them died. After their deaths, Longinus dispatched Helmichis' forces to Constantinople, while the remaining Lombards had already found a new king in Cleph.|$|E
5|$|The coup {{ultimately}} failed, as it {{met with}} the resistance {{of most of the}} warriors, who were opposed to the king's assassination. As a result, the Lombard garrison in Ticinum proclaimed Duke Cleph the new king, and Helmichis, rather than going to war against overwhelming odds, escaped to <b>Ravenna</b> with Longinus' assistance, taking with him his wife, his troops, the royal treasure and Alboin's daughter Albsuinda. In <b>Ravenna</b> the two lovers became estranged and killed each other. Subsequently, Longinus sent Albsuinda and the treasure to Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|In AD 515 Eutharic {{answered}} a summons by Theoderic the Great {{and moved to}} the Ostrogothic court at <b>Ravenna</b> in Italy. Here he was given in marriage Amalasuintha, the daughter of the king. It was Theoderic's intention that this union would create a long-lasting dynastic connection between the previously sundered Ostrogoths and Visigoths. Theoderic also named Eutharic his presumptive heir.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} record contains few details of Romulus' life. He {{was the son}} of Orestes, a Roman who once served as a secretary in the court of Attila the Hun before coming into the service of Julius Nepos in AD 475. In the same year he was promoted to the rank of magister militum, but then led a military revolt that forced Nepos to flee into exile. With the capital of <b>Ravenna</b> under his control, Orestes appointed his son, Romulus to the throne despite the lack of support from the eastern court in Constantinople. Romulus, however, {{was little more than a}} child and figurehead for his father's rule. After ten months in power, during which time his authority and legitimacy were disputed beyond Italy, Romulus was forced to abdicate by Odoacer, a Germanic foederatus officer who defeated and executed Orestes. After seizing control of <b>Ravenna,</b> Odoacer sent the former emperor to live in the Castellum Lucullanum in Campania, after which he disappears from the {{historical record}}.|$|E
5|$|As a {{proxy for}} his father, Romulus made no {{decisions}} and left no monuments, though coins bearing his name were minted in Rome, Milan, <b>Ravenna,</b> and Gaul. Several months after Orestes took power, a coalition of Heruli, Scirian and Turcilingi mercenaries demanded that he give them {{a third of the}} land in Italy. When Orestes refused, the tribes revolted under the leadership of the Scirian chieftain Odoacer. Orestes was captured near Piacenza on 28 August 476 and swiftly executed.|$|E

5|$|For {{the events}} {{surrounding}} 572, the most exhaustive source available is Paul the Deacon's Historia Langobardorum, {{a history of the}} Lombard nation up to 744. The book was finished {{in the last two decades}} of the 8th century, after the Lombard Kingdom had been conquered by the Franks in 774. Because of the apparent presence in the work of many fragments preserved from Lombard oral tradition, Paul's work has been often interpreted as a tribute to a vanishing culture. Among these otherwise lost traditions stands the tale of Alboin's death. According to Herwig Wolfram, what Paul deals with is an example of how nationally vital events were personalized to make them easier to preserve in the collective memory. Even later than the Historia Langobardorum, but possibly using earlier lost sources, are the last two primary sources to speak about Helmichis: the anonymous Historia Langobardorum Codicis Gothani and the Liber Pontificalis Ecclesiae Ravennatis written by Andreas Agnellus. The first is a brief Christianizing version of the Origo that was made in the first decade of the 9th century from a Carolingian point of view. The second was written in the 830s by a priest from <b>Ravenna</b> and is a history of the bishops who held the see of <b>Ravenna</b> through the ages. Agnellus' passage on Alboin and Rosamund is mostly derived from Paul and little else.|$|E
5|$|In 535, a small Byzantine {{expedition}} to Sicily met with easy success, but the Goths soon stiffened their resistance, and victory {{did not come}} until 540, when Belisarius captured <b>Ravenna,</b> after successful sieges of Naples and Rome. In 535–536, Theodahad sent Pope Agapetus I to Constantinople to request the removal of Byzantine forces from Sicily, Dalmatia, and Italy. Although Agapetus failed in his mission to sign a peace with Justinian, he succeeded in having the Monophysite Patriarch Anthimus I of Constantinople denounced, despite empress Theodora's support and protection.|$|E
5|$|Odoacer {{advanced}} on <b>Ravenna,</b> {{capturing the}} city and the young emperor. Romulus was compelled to abdicate the throne on 4 September 476. This act has been cited {{as the end of the}} Western Roman Empire, although Romulus' deposition did not cause any significant disruption at the time. Rome had already lost its hegemony over the provinces, Germans dominated the Roman army and Germanic generals like Odoacer had long been the real powers behind the throne. Italy would suffer far greater devastation in the next century when Emperor Justinian I reconquered it.|$|E

5|$|Proposals {{for rapid}} transit service through the Roosevelt {{neighborhood}} {{date back to}} the early 20th century, when the area was near the northern city limits of Seattle. In 1911, Virgil Bogue proposed an extensive rapid transit system, including an underground subway following 10th Avenue Northeast from Northeast 85th Street south towards Latona (the present-day University District) and Downtown Seattle. The proposal was rejected by voters the following year, but an un-adopted 1926 plan from the Planning Commission included rapid transit service to <b>Ravenna</b> Park and the University District.|$|E

50|$|The classis <b>Ravennas</b> {{recruited}} its crews {{mostly from}} the East, especially from Egypt. Since Rome did not face any naval threat in the Mediterranean, {{the bulk of the}} fleet's crews was idle. Some of the sailors were based in Rome itself, initially housed in the barracks of the Praetorian Guard, but later given their own barracks, the Castra Ravennatium across the Tiber. There they were used to stage mock naval battles (naumachiae), and operated the mechanism that deployed the canvas canopy of the Colosseum. In 70, Emperor Vespasian also levied the legio II Adiutrix from the marines of classis <b>Ravennas.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{contemporary}} Catholic {{chronicle of}} the Anonymus Valesianus portrays Eutharic {{in a negative}} light, connecting him with taking the Jews' side in anti-Jewish disturbances in <b>Ravenna</b> over the Jewish congregation's rights to their synagogue; the disagreement prompted a conflict between the Arians and Catholics as the Arian Eutharic chose {{to side with the}} Jewish people. It is thought that the outrage expressed by the Catholics at this action was in proportion to Eutharic's being a symbol of the recent reconciliation between the Eastern and Western Churches brought about under the direction of Theoderic.|$|E
5|$|The first attested {{instance}} of strong resistance to Alboin's migration {{took place at}} the town of Ticinum (Pavia), which he started to besiege in 569 and captured only after three years. The town was of strategic importance, sitting at the confluence of the rivers Po and Ticino and connected by waterways to <b>Ravenna,</b> the capital of Byzantine Italy and the seat of the Praetorian prefecture of Italy. Its fall cut direct communications between the garrisons stationed on the Alpes Maritimae and the Adriatic coast.|$|E
5|$|Alboin {{was assassinated}} on June 28, 572, in a coup d'état instigated by the Byzantines. It was {{organized}} by the king's foster brother, Helmichis, {{with the support of}} Alboin's wife, Rosamund, daughter of the Gepid king whom Alboin had killed some years earlier. The coup failed in the face of opposition from a majority of the Lombards, who elected Cleph as Alboin's successor, forcing Helmichis and Rosamund to flee to <b>Ravenna</b> under imperial protection. Alboin's death deprived the Lombards of the only leader who could have kept the newborn Germanic entity together, the last in the line of hero-kings who had led the Lombards through their migrations from the vale of the Elbe to Italy. For many centuries following his death Alboin's heroism and his success in battle were celebrated in Saxon and Bavarian epic poetry.|$|E

5|$|Cleph {{kept the}} throne for only 18 months before being assassinated by a slave. Possibly {{he too was}} killed at the {{instigation}} of the Byzantines, who had every interest in avoiding a hostile and solid leadership among the Lombards. An important success for the Byzantines was that no king was proclaimed to succeed Cleph, opening a decade of interregnum, thus making them more vulnerable to attacks from Franks and Byzantines. It was only {{when faced with the}} danger of annihilation by the Franks in 584 that the dukes elected a new king in the person of Authari, son of Cleph, who began the definitive consolidation and centralization of the Lombard kingdom while the remaining imperial territories were reorganized under the control of an exarch in <b>Ravenna</b> with the capacity to defend the country without the Emperor's assistance.|$|E
5|$|Coins are {{the only}} items in the Hoxne Hoard for which a {{definite}} date and place of manufacture can be established. All of the gold coins, {{and many of the}} silver coins, bear the names and portraits of the emperor in whose reign they were minted. Most also retain the original mint marks that identify where they were minted, illustrating the Roman system of regional mints producing coins to a uniform design. The coins' manufacture has been traced back to a total of 14 sources: Trier, Arles and Lyon (in Gaul), <b>Ravenna,</b> Milan, Aquileia, Rome (in modern Italy); Siscia (modern Croatia), Sirmium (modern Serbia), Thessaloniki (Greece), Constantinople, Cyzicus, Nicomedia, and Antioch (modern Turkey).|$|E
5|$|Finally, Justinian {{dispatched}} {{a force of}} approximately 35,000 men (2,000 men were detached and sent to invade southern Visigothic Hispania) {{under the command of}} Narses. The army reached <b>Ravenna</b> in June 552, and defeated the Ostrogoths decisively within a month at the battle of Busta Gallorum in the Apennines, where Totila was slain. After a second battle at Mons Lactarius in October that year, the resistance of the Ostrogoths was finally broken. In 554, a large-scale Frankish invasion was defeated at Casilinum, and Italy was secured for the Empire, though it would take Narses several years to reduce the remaining Gothic strongholds. At the end of the war, Italy was garrisoned with an army of 16,000 men. The recovery of Italy cost the empire about 300,000 pounds of gold.|$|E
50|$|Sometime between 35 and 12 BCE, Octavian (later {{known as}} Augustus) {{established}} <b>Ravenna's</b> harbor {{as one of}} the home ports for his new Roman navy.
