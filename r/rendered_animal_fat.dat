40|$|Biodiesel is a fuel {{consisting}} of the alkyl monoesters of fatty acids from vegetable oils or <b>animal</b> <b>fats.</b> Biodiesel is receiving increasing attention as an alternative, non-toxic, biodegradable and renewable diesel fuel. Many {{studies have shown that}} the properties of biodiesel are very close to diesel fuel. Therefore, biodiesel can be used in diesel engines with little or no modification.;Biodiesel is usually produced from food-grade vegetable oils that are more expensive than diesel fuel. Therefore, use of biodiesel produced from food-grade vegetable oil may be limited to cases of severe shortages or emergencies. However, lower cost feedstocks are available. <b>Rendered</b> <b>animal</b> <b>fats</b> and restaurant waste oils are an attractive source to produce biodiesel. The problem with processing rendered fats and oils is that they usually contain large amounts of free fatty acids that cannot be converted to biodiesel using an alkaline catalyst due to the formation of soaps. An alternative way is to use acid catalysts, which are more tolerant of free fatty acids.;The objective of this study was to develop a process to utilize rendered fats, known as yellow grease, as a biodiesel feedstock and to build a pilot plant to implement this process. The pilot plant was successfully constructed and was shown to be capable of processing rendered fats containing 40 % free fatty acids.;After preparing a sufficient amount of biodiesel from <b>rendered</b> <b>animal</b> <b>fats</b> and restaurant waste oils, the impact of the biodiesel on diesel engine exhaust emissions and engine performance was evaluated and compared to No. 2 diesel fuel and soybean oil methyl ester.

50|$|With {{the advent}} of the rifle-musket and the {{widespread}} adoption of rifled barrels by military forces, the spherical projectile eventually died out — though the new elongated bullets were still called balls in the military (indeed, full metal jacket ammunition is called ball ammunition to this day). While both conical bullets and balls were used with rifles, both in cartridge and loose form for several hundred years, the mid 19th century Minié ball contained a number of important innovations that allowed rifled weapons to be adopted by the main infantry units, rather than being the preserve of elite skirmisher and rifle units as had been the case before. Minie balls were manufactured in a smaller diameter than the bore of the weapon it was to be used in, just like a normal musket ball; this allowed for easy loading, even when the gun was fouled, while a rifle ball had to be forced down the tight-fitting barrel by force, even using a mallet. When fired, the pressure of the gases would force the bullet to expand, fitting tightly into the rifling grooves, unlike the loose-fitting and inaccurate musket ball. This was achieved by including a deep cavity in the rear, into which fitted (initially) an iron hemispherical cup, later a conical clay or timber plug, which caused the base of the projectile to expand upon firing, sealing the skirt to the bore, allowing an undersized projectile to be used for ease of loading without a patch. (Eventually {{it was found that the}} pressure of the powder gases expanded the base to fit the bore, without any plug or filler.) Another was a number of grooves around the projectile, the leading edges of which are intended to scrape out the fouling but were found better used making the projectile more accurate when filled with a lubricant (traditionally made of beeswax and <b>rendered</b> <b>animal</b> <b>fat.)</b> As noted before, this lubricant also serves to keep soft the black powder fouling, thus making the fouled barrel much easier to reload.|$|E

Linseed oil, independent of accompanying dietary fat source, lead to increased levels of the n- 3 EPA, DPA and DHA and reduced levels of the n- 6 arachidonic acid (AA). The ratio between AA/EPA was reduced from 19 / 1 in the soybean oil dietary groups to 1. 7 / 1 in the linseed oil dietary groups. Dietary red palm oil reduced total chicken plasma cholesterol levels. There were no differences between the dietary groups with regard to measured meat antioxidant capacity or sensory evaluation. Chicken meat selenium levels were clearly influenced by dietary selenium levels, but were not influenced by feed fatty acid composition. High dietary selenium level lead to marginally increased n- 3 EPA and higher meat fat % in breast muscle but did not influence the other LC PUFA levels.

40|$|Abstract:- Processing {{of waste}} {{triglycerides}} by conventional trans-esterification is problematic {{due to high}} free fatty acid (FFA) content. Free fatty acid turns to soap that renders the trans-esterification process inoperable. Clean triglycerides such as soy, corn, and canola oils are low in FFA and easy to process but too expensive as fuel feedstocks. We have been exploring a system that combines thermal cracking of waste triglycerides with acid esterification. Middle distillates (bp 165 oC- 345 oC) obtained by continuous thermal cracking of waste triglycerides were batch-esterified using methanol and Amberlyst 36 (wet). The yields of middle distillate from thermal cracking ranged from 58 - 63 wt % for trap grease and 60 - 68 wt % for <b>rendered</b> <b>animal</b> <b>fat.</b> More {{than half of the}} middle distillates was fatty acids and the rest were conventional hydrocarbons. The esterification of the middle distillate with methanol was done at 90 oC for 20 h.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this proposal is to enable Iowa State University to establish a Center that enjoys world-class stature and eventually enhances the economy through the transfer of innovation from the laboratory to the marketplace. The funds {{have been used to}} support experimental proposals from interdisciplinary research teams in areas related to catalysis and green chemistry. Specific focus areas included: • Catalytic conversion of renewable natural resources to industrial materials • Development of new catalysts for the oxidation or reduction of commodity chemicals • Use of enzymes and microorganisms in biocatalysis • Development of new, environmentally friendly reactions of industrial importance These focus areas intersect with barriers from the MYTP draft document. Specifically, section 2. 4. 3. 1 Processing and Conversion has a list of bulleted items under Improved Chemical Conversions that includes new hydrogenation catalysts, milder oxidation catalysts, new catalysts for dehydration and selective bond cleavage catalysts. Specifically, the four sections are: 1. Catalyst development (7. 4. 12. A) 2. Conversion of glycerol (7. 4. 12. B) 3. Conversion of biodiesel (7. 4. 12. C) 4. Glucose from starch (7. 4. 12. D) All funded projects are part of a soybean or corn biorefinery. Two funded projects that have made significant progress toward goals of the MYTP draft document are: Catalysts to convert feedstocks with high fatty acid content to biodiesel (Kraus, Lin, Verkade) and Conversion of Glycerol into 1, 3 -Propanediol (Lin, Kraus). Currently, biodiesel is prepared using homogeneous base catalysis. However, as producers look for feedstocks other than soybean oil, such as waste restaurant oils and <b>rendered</b> <b>animal</b> <b>fats,</b> they have observed a large amount of free fatty acids contained in the feedstocks. Free fatty acids cannot be converted into biodiesel using homogeneous base-mediated processes. The CCAT catalyst system offers an integrated and cooperative catalytic system that performs both esterification (of free fatty acids) and transesterification (of soybean oil) in a one-pot fashion. This will allow the biodiesel producers to use the aforementioned cheap feedstocks without any pretreatment. In addition, the catalyst system is heterogeneous and is highly recyclable and reusable. Although markets currently exist for glycerin, concern is mounting that the price of glycerin may plummet to $. 05 - $. 10 per pound if future production exceeds demand. Developing a system to make high value chemicals such as 1, 3 -propanediol from the glycerin stream will add value for biodiesel producers who implement the new technology. Given the fact that both DuPont and Shell chemicals have announced the commercialization of two new PDO-based polymers, a rapid increase of market demand for a cheaper PDO source is very likely. 4.

At the end of the experiment (day 38), 6 pcs of broiler chickens from each group with an average live body weight over 1 800 g were randomly selected. The samples for chemical analysis consisted of identical proportion of breast and thigh muscle, and about 1 cm 2 of skin with subcutaneous fat. Fat from the meat was obtained after the samples drying. A fat was determined by extraction by means of laboratory instrument Det N Gras Selecta P. The oxidative stability of meat on the basis of acid number of fat was determided by chemical analysis. Chicken meat was stored at - 18 °C for 12 months and 18 months. The acid number of fat of stored meat for 12  months was 7. 38 mg KOH per g in the control group, 7. 42 mg KOH per g in the group with a proportion of 4 % alfalfa meal, and 11. 18 mg KOH per g in the group with proportion 6 % alfalfa meal. An acid number of fat of stored meat for 18 months was 5. 90 mg KOH per g in the control group, 4. 65 mg KOH per g in the group with a proportion of 4 % alfalfa meal, and 7. 07 mg KOH per g in the group with a proportion of 6 % alfalfa meal.

A single cylinder direct injection diesel engine is tested using neat diesel, neat <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> and <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> emulsion (optimal emulsion) as fuels under variable load operating conditions. Results show increased peak pressure and ignition delay with ethanol <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> emulsion as compared to neat fat. Heat release pattern shows improvement in the premixed combustion phase with <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> emulsion as compared to neat <b>animal</b> <b>fat.</b> Drastic reduction in smoke, nitric oxide, hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions are observed with the emulsion as compared to neat fat and neat diesel mainly at high power outputs. Only, hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions are found as high with the emulsion at light loads. In general, <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> emulsion shows considerable reduction in all emissions and improvement in engine performance as compared to neat fat. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In 200 B.C., ancient Greek women applied white lead powder and chalk to lighten their skin. It was considered fashionable for Greek women to have a pale complexion. Roman women also favoured a pale complexion. Wealthy Romans favoured white lead paste, {{which could lead to}} disfigurements and death. Men also wore makeup to lighten their skin tone. They used white lead powder, chalk, and creams to lighten their skin tone. The cream was made from <b>animal</b> <b>fat,</b> starch, and tin oxide. The <b>fat</b> was <b>rendered</b> from <b>animal</b> carcasses and heated to remove the color. Tin oxide was made out of heating tin metal in open air. The <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> provided a smooth texture, while the tin oxide provided color to the cream.|$|R

40|$|An {{international}} {{ecologic study}} {{on the relationship between}} fat intake, cigarette consumption, and age-specific lung cancer mortality rates was conducted using data obtained from 29 countries. The 1969 - 71 and 1984 - 86 mortality rates for lung cancer were related to smoking habits and to levels of <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> intake. Highly significant independent positive correlations for lung cancer with both cigarette smoking and <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> consumption were seen. No significant independent relationship was found between lung cancer mortality and vegetable fat consumption. In a multiple regression analysis linking lung cancer mortality to dietary intake of <b>animal</b> <b>fat,</b> cigarette smoking, and the interaction term between cigarette smoking and <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> intake, only the latter term was significant (P less than 0. 001) pointing towards a role for <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> as a promoter of lung cancer. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Total {{spectrofluorimetry}} {{associated with}} Principal Component Analysis (PCA) {{was used to}} discriminate samples of vegetable oil and <b>animal</b> <b>fat.</b> In addition, a multivariate calibration model was developed that combines spectrofluri metry with Partial Least Squares (PLS) for prediction of concentration of <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> in mixture with vegetable oil.

This method has potential application in the control of quality of raw material for production of biodiesel. The control of the concentra tion of <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> is important because <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> is more susceptible to oxidation than vegetable oil.

Overlay of FTIR spectra did not help to pinpoint any characteristic feature to distinguish either LO or LS from other <b>animal</b> <b>fats,</b> but overlay of DSC cooling curves helped a successful discrimination. The determination of δ 13 C from EA-IRMS showed that the values corresponding to the fractionated components of lard were significantly (p< 0. 05) {{different from those of the}} other common <b>animal</b> <b>fats.</b> GC-MS analysis showed that direct comparison of overall fatty acid data was not able to discriminate LO and LS from other <b>animal</b> <b>fats,</b> but the application of principal component analysis (PCA) to fatty acid data helped a successful discrimination...|$|R
