40|$|To {{investigate}} sepal/petal/lip {{formation in}} Oncidium Gower Ramsey, three paleoAPETALA 3 genes, O. Gower Ramsey MADS box gene 5 (OMADS 5; clade 1), OMADS 3 (clade 2), and OMADS 9 (clade 3), and one PISTILLATA gene, OMADS 8, were characterized. The OMADS 8 and OMADS 3 mRNAs were expressed {{in all four}} floral organs {{as well as in}} vegetative leaves. The OMADS 9 mRNA was only strongly detected in petals and lips. The mRNA for OMADS 5 was only strongly detected in sepals and petals and was significantly down-regulated in lip-like petals and lip-like sepals of peloric mutant flowers. This result revealed a possible negative role for OMADS 5 in <b>regulating</b> <b>lip</b> formation. Yeast two-hybrid analysis indicated that OMADS 5 formed homodimers and heterodimers with OMADS 3 and OMADS 9. OMADS 8 only formed heterodimers with OMADS 3, whereas OMADS 3 and OMADS 9 formed homodimers and heterodimers with each other. We proposed that sepal/petal/lip formation needs the presence of OMADS 3 / 8 and/or OMADS 9. The determination of the final organ identity for the sepal/petal/lip likely depended on {{the presence or absence of}} OMADS 5. The presence of OMADS 5 caused short sepal/petal formation. When OMADS 5 was absent, cells could proliferate, resulting in the possible formation of large lips and the conversion of the sepal/petal into lips in peloric mutants. Further analysis indicated that only ectopic expression of OMADS 8 but not OMADS 5 / 9 caused the conversion of the sepal into an expanded petal-like structure in transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants...|$|E
40|$|Oncidium Gower Ramsey is {{a popular}} orchid with {{delicate}} flower shapes, and withhigh economic values in the international cut flower markets. The exploration of themechanism controlling flower development and the increasing {{of the diversity of}} theflower shapes for O. Gower Ramsey through biotechnology are important. Comparedwith other orchids, the large and well-expanded lips make O. Gower Ramsey a specialcase {{for the study of the}} diverse functions of MADS box genes during the flowerdevelopment. Up to date, four B class MADS box genes, including three paleoAP 3 homologs (OMADS 3 /OMADS 5 /OMADS 9) and one PI homolog (OMADS 8), inregulating perianth formation in O. Gower Ramsey have been cloned andcharacterized in our laboratory. The OMADS 8 and OMADS 3 mRNAs were expressedin all four floral organs. The OMADS 9 mRNA was only detected in petals and lips. The mRNA for OMADS 5 was only detected in sepals and petals. This result revealed apossible negative role for OMADS 5 in <b>regulating</b> <b>lip</b> formation. The determination ofthe final organ identity for the sepal/petal/lip likely depended on the presence orabsence of OMADS 5. The presence of OMADS 5 caused short sepal/petal formation. When OMADS 5 was absent, cells may proliferate, resulting in the possible formationof large lips. The prime objective of this proposal is to generate transgenic O. GowerRamsey with various modified flower shapes by ectopic expressing sense or RNAi ofOMADS 5. For example, the knock down of the OMADS 5 expression by RNAi strategy(pOMADS 5 ::OMADS 5 -RNAi) specifically in the sepals and peals will potentiallyconvert these two organs into lips, and then produced flowers with multiple (6) lips. By contrast, ectopic expression of OMADS 5 (pOMADS 9 ::OMADS 5) in lips willconvert lip into sepal/petal and resulted in a flower with 6 sepal/petals. For theobjective to identify the sepal/petal/lip-specific interacting protein complexes forOMADS 3 / 5 / 9 / 8 in O. Gower Ramsey, in vitro co-immunoprecipitation assay (co-IP),mass spectrometry (MS) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) will beperformed in this study. To further gain insight into the effects of C-terminal sequenceon the dimerization and function of paleoAP 3 homologs (OMADS 3 and OMADS 5) and PI homolog (OMADS 8), yeast two-hybrid analysis, electrophoretic mobility shiftassay (EMSA) and complementation analysis in ap 3 or pi mutants by usingOMADS 3 / 5 / 8 with serial deletions in the C-terminal region will be performed. Theseresults will help to know how these Oncidium B function MADS box proteins formcooperative complexes during sepal/petal/lip development and will lead to a betterunderstanding of the “orchid code” for Oncidium floral organ identity. 文心蘭歷年出口值穩定成長，是少數能以單一品系及花色達到如此高經濟效應之蘭花，若能對文心蘭花形調控加以研究並進一步透過生物技術加以改造，相信對文心蘭之產業將更有助益。文心蘭的花朵構造中，唇瓣是觀賞價值中極為重要的部分，本實驗室已自文心蘭選殖四個與花萼/花瓣/唇瓣發育相關之B 功能MADSbox 基因: OMADS 3 /OMADS 5 /OMADS 9 屬於paleoAP 3 分支，OMADS 8 屬於PI 分支。研究發現OMADS 3 與OMADS 8 是花萼/花瓣/唇瓣發育必須存在的成員，同時加入OMADS 5 與OMADS 9 之表現時會促成花瓣發育，只加入OMADS 5 之表現時促成花萼發育，只加入OMADS 9 之表現則促成唇瓣發育。由此基因表現模式可知OMADS 5 在唇瓣發育上扮演的是負調控的角色，在花萼/花瓣/唇瓣中只要OMADS 5 不表現則會使花器分化為唇瓣。基於此，本計劃首要目的在改造文心蘭花形，預計建構多種促進或抑制OMADS 5 表現之載體，並進行基因轉殖，預期轉殖pOMADS 5 ::OMADS 5 -RNAi 載體之文心蘭花萼/花瓣會變成唇瓣化的現象，進而可產生多唇瓣花形之轉殖文心蘭。另一方面以表現於唇瓣的OMADS 9 起動子，建構pOMADS 9 ::OMADS 5 載體，使OMADS 5 表現於唇瓣中，則轉殖文心蘭之唇瓣將轉化成花萼/花瓣，產生花形變小之文心蘭。此外依據ABCDE model 的理論，調控文心蘭花萼/花瓣/唇瓣的發育除了需要B 功能基因群所組成的複合物以外，亦須A/E 功能基因群及其他非MADS box 基因的參與，本計劃將以免疫共沉澱法(co-immunoprecipitation, co-IP) ， 分別以OMADS 3 、OMADS 8 、OMADS 5 及OMADS 9 專一性抗體分離花萼、花瓣或唇瓣中MADS box 蛋白質複合體，再以質譜分析(mass spectrometry, MS) 專一性抗體所沉澱下來的蛋白質複合體成份，以分析調控花萼、花瓣或唇瓣之蛋白質複合體組成為何。另外我們也將利用螢光共振能量轉移系統(Fluorescence resonance energy transfer, FRET) ，觀察植物活體細胞中OMADS 3 、OMADS 8 、OMADS 5 及OMADS 9 兩兩形成雙聚體進入細胞核的能力。本計劃亦將進一步分析B 功能paleoAP 3 同源蛋白質OMADS 3 /OMADS 5 及PI 同源蛋白質OMADS 8 C 端胺基酸序列影響兩者形成雙聚體及執行其功能的能力。將對OMADS 3 、OMADS 5 及OMADS 8 的C 端序列作漸進式截切，以酵母菌雙雜合系統及EMSA (electrophoretic mobility shift assay) 分析其形成雙聚體之能力，並將其進行在阿拉伯芥ap 3 或pi 突變株中之互補試驗， 以了解OMADS 3 /OMADS 5 /OMADS 8 C 端胺基酸序列與其調控花萼/花瓣/唇瓣功能之關係...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{transcription}} factor, CCAAT enhancer binding protein-β (C/EBPβ), {{is expressed}} as several distinct protein isoforms (LAP 1, LAP 2 and LIP) that have opposing actions in cellular proliferation and differentiation. Increases in {{the ratio of}} LIP/LAP are associated with aggressive, metastatic breast cancer; however, little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms that <b>regulate</b> <b>LIP</b> expression or the biological actions {{of an increase in}} the LIP/LAP ratio. Metastasis is highly dependent upon the suppression of anoikis and the role of C/EBPβ and LIP in this anchorage-independent, survival process is currently not known in mammary epithelial cells. IGF- 1 R signaling is important for the survival of breast cancer cells and crosstalk between IGF- 1 R and EGFR signaling pathways have been implicated in the development of more aggressive disease. We therefore evaluated in mammary epithelial cells whether IGF- 1 R signaling regulates the LIP/LAP ratio, analyzed the potential interplay between EGFR and IGF- 1 R signaling and addressed the biological significance of increased LIP expression in cellular survival and suppression of anoikis. Results Our data provide the first evidence that IGF- 1 R signaling <b>regulates</b> <b>LIP</b> expression in an EGFR independent manner to increase the LIP/LAP ratio in mammary epithelial cells. Although crosstalk between IGF- 1 R signaling and EGFR signaling is detectable in MCF 10 A cells, this crosstalk is not required for the IGF- 1 mediated regulation of LIP expression. Rather, the critical regulator of IGF- 1 induced LIP expression appears to be EGFR-independent, Akt activity. Our data also demonstrate that increases in LIP expression promote cell survival via suppression of anoikis. Likewise, knockdown of total C/EBPβ leads to increased cell death and suggest that C/EBPβ expression is important for survival and resistance to anoikis. IGF- 1 treatment can partially rescue vector control cells from anoikis; however, cells with reduced C/EBPβ expression do not survive anoikis. Conclusions Taken together, our data demonstrate that IGF- 1 R signaling <b>regulates</b> <b>LIP</b> expression in an EGFR independent manner to increase the LIP/LAP ratio in mammary epithelial cells. C/EBPβ expression and elevations in LIP {{play an important role in}} regulating cellular survival via suppression of anoikis, in an IGF- 1 R mediated context or in a manner independent of IGF- 1 R signaling. </p...|$|R
40|$|Many {{white rot}} fungi {{are able to}} produce de novo veratryl alcohol, which {{is known to be}} a {{cofactor}} involved in the degradation of lignin, lignin model compounds, and xenobiotic pollutants by lignin peroxidase (LiP). In this study, Mn nutrition was shown to strongly influence the endogenous veratryl alcohol levels in the culture fluids of N-deregulated and N-regulated white rot fungi Bjerkandera sp. strain BOS 55 and Phanerochaete chrysosporium BKM-F- 1767, respectively. Endogenous veratryl alcohol levels as high as 0. 75 mM in Bjerkandera sp. strain BOS 55 and 2. 5 mM in P. chrysosporium were observed under Mn-deficient conditions. In contrast, veratryl alcohol production was dramatically decreased in cultures supplemented with 33 or 264 (mu) M Mn. The LiP titers, which were highest in Mn-deficient media, were shown to parallel the endogenous veratryl alcohol levels, indicating that these two parameters are related. When exogenous veratryl alcohol was added to Mn-sufficient media, high LiP titers were obtained. Consequently, we concluded that Mn does not <b>regulate</b> <b>LiP</b> expression directly. Instead, LiP titers are enhanced by the increased production of veratryl alcohol. The well-known role of veratryl alcohol in protecting LiP from inactivation by physiological levels of H(inf 2) O(inf 2) is postulated to be the major reason why <b>LiP</b> is apparently <b>regulated</b> by Mn. Provided that Mn was absent, LiP titers in Bjerkandera sp. strain BOS 55 increased with enhanced fungal growth obtained by increasing the nutrient N concentration while veratryl alcohol levels were similar in both N-limited and N-sufficient conditions...|$|R
40|$|Recently, Mn(II) {{has been}} shown to induce {{manganese}} peroxidases (MnPs) and repress lignin peroxidases (LiPs) in defined liquid cultures of several white rot organisms. The present work shows that laccase is also regulated by Mn(II). We therefore used Mn(II) to <b>regulate</b> production of <b>LiP,</b> MnP, and laccase activities while determining the effects of Mn(II) on mineralization of ring-labeled synthetic lignin. At a low Mn(II) level, Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Phlebia brevispora produced relatively high titers of LiPs but only low titers of MnPs. At a high Mn(II) level, MnP titers increased 12 - to 20 -fold, but LiPs were not detected in crude broths. P. brevispora formed much less LiP than P. chrysosporium, but it also produced laccase activity that increased more than sevenfold at the high Mn(II) level. The rates of synthetic lignin mineralization by these organisms were similar and were almost seven times higher at low than at high Mn(II). Increased synthetic lignin mineralization therefore correlated with increased LiP, not with increased MnP or laccase activities...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{upper lip}} and primary palate form an {{essential}} {{separation between the}} brain, nasal structures and the oral cavity. Surprisingly {{little is known about}} the development of these structures, despite the fact that abnormalities can result in various forms of orofacial clefts. We have uncovered that retinoic acid is a critical regulator of upper lip and primary palate development in Xenopus laevis. Retinoic acid synthesis enzyme, RALDH 2, and retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARγ) are expressed in complementary and partially overlapping regions of the orofacial prominences that fate mapping revealed contribute to the upper lip and primary palate. Decreased RALDH 2 and RARγ result in a median cleft in the upper lip and primary palate. To further understand how retinoic acid <b>regulates</b> upper <b>lip</b> and palate morphogenesis we searched for genes downregulated in response to RARγ inhibition in orofacial tissue, and uncovered homeobox genes lhx 8 and msx 2. These genes are both expressed in overlapping domains with RARγ, and together their loss of function also results in a median cleft in the upper lip and primary palate. Inhibition of RARγ and decreased Lhx 8 /Msx 2 function result in decreased cell proliferation and failure of dorsal anterior cartilages to form. These results suggest a model whereby retinoic acid signaling regulates Lhx 8 and Msx 2, which together direct the tissue growth and differentiation necessary for the upper lip and primary palate morphogenesis. This work has the potential to better understand the complex nature of the upper lip and primary palate development which will lead to important insights into the etiology of human orofacial clefts...|$|R
