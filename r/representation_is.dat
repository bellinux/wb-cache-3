5|$|A {{conspiracy}} trial presents complicated {{questions of}} {{strategy for the}} defense. There are advantages and disadvantages in having separate counsel for each defendant or a single counsel for more than one. Joint <b>representation</b> <b>is</b> a means of insuring against reciprocal recrimination. A common defense often gives strength against a common attack.|$|E
5|$|When {{constructing}} theories such as QED {{which is}} invariant under space parity and time reversal, Dirac spinors may be used, while theories that do not, {{such as the}} electroweak force, must be formulated in terms of Weyl spinors. The Dirac <b>representation,</b> , <b>is</b> usually taken to include both space parity and time inversions. Without space parity inversion, {{it is not an}} irreducible representation.|$|E
50|$|In particular, if both Stinespring <b>representations</b> <b>are</b> minimal, W is unitary. Thus minimal Stinespring <b>representations</b> <b>are</b> unique up to {{a unitary}} transformation.|$|R
50|$|Eliminativists {{think that}} {{subjective}} representations don't exist. Reductivists think subjective <b>representations</b> <b>are</b> reducible to objective. Non-reductivists think that subjective <b>representations</b> <b>are</b> real and distinct.|$|R
50|$|Structural <b>representations</b> <b>are</b> also important. These {{types of}} <b>representations</b> <b>are</b> {{basically}} mental maps {{that we have}} in our minds that correspond exactly to those objects in the world (the intentional content). According to Morgan, structural <b>representations</b> <b>are</b> not the same as mental representations—there is nothing mental about them: plants can have structural representations.|$|R
5|$|A {{common and}} popular {{structural}} alignment method is the DALI, or distance alignment matrix method, which breaks the input structures into hexapeptide fragments and calculates a distance matrix by evaluating the contact patterns between successive fragments. Secondary structure features that involve residues that are contiguous in sequence {{appear on the}} matrix's main diagonal; other diagonals in the matrix reflect spatial contacts between residues that are not near {{each other in the}} sequence. When these diagonals are parallel to the main diagonal, the features they represent are parallel; when they are perpendicular, their features are antiparallel. This <b>representation</b> <b>is</b> memory-intensive because the features in the square matrix are symmetrical (and thus redundant) about the main diagonal.|$|E
5|$|After independence, the Parliament of Singapore {{remained}} fully elected until 1984, when {{amendments to}} the Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act were passed to provide for Non-constituency Members of Parliament ("NCMPs"). NCMPs, who are declared elected by the returning officer, consist of the best performing losers in general elections based on the percentage of votes cast. The scheme ensures that opposition <b>representation</b> <b>is</b> accounted for in the Parliament. In 1990, yet another type of unelected Member was introduced – the Nominated Member of Parliament ("NMP"). These non-partisan Members were brought in to provide alternate views on policies that differed from the opinions espoused by the political parties represented in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Although {{diplomatic}} <b>representation</b> <b>is</b> reserved to the Crown, Jersey {{has been}} developing its own international identity over recent years. It negotiates directly with foreign governments on matters within the competence of the States of Jersey. Jersey maintains the Bureau des Iles Anglo-Normandes in Caen, France, a permanent non-diplomatic representation. A similar office, the Maison de Normandie in St. Helier, represents the Conseil général of Manche and the Regional Council of Normandy. It also houses the Consulate of France. In July 2009, a Channel Islands Tunnel was proposed to connect Jersey with Lower Normandy.|$|E

40|$|We {{construct}} SU(N) irreducible Schwinger bosons satisfying certain U(N- 1) constraints which {{implement the}} symmetries of SU(N) Young tableaues. As a result all SU(N) irreducible <b>representations</b> <b>are</b> simple monomials of $(N- 1) $ types of SU(N) irreducible Schwinger bosons.

On the state level, the city {{is part of the}} 18th district in the Michigan Senate, represented by Democrat Rebekah Warren. In the Michigan House of Representatives, <b>representation</b> <b>is</b> split between the 55th district (northern Ann Arbor, part of Ann Arbor Township, and other surrounding areas, represented by Democrat Adam Zemke), the 53rd district (most of downtown and the southern half of the city, represented by Democrat Yousef Rabhi) and the 52nd district (southwestern areas outside Ann Arbor proper and western Washtenaw County, represented by Democrat Donna Lasinski).|$|E
5|$|As {{regards the}} first question, in Borissik v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009), the Singapore High Court adopted four {{conditions}} {{set out in}} De Smith's Judicial Review (6th ed., 2007) {{to determine whether a}} legitimate expectation has been created. The public body's representation must be clear, unambiguous and devoid of any relevant qualification; induced by the conduct of the decision-maker; made by a person with actual or ostensible authority; and applicable to the applicant, who belongs to the class of persons to whom the <b>representation</b> <b>is</b> reasonably expected to apply.|$|E
5|$|Protein {{structures}} have to {{be represented}} in some coordinate-independent space to make them comparable. This is typically achieved by constructing a sequence-to-sequence matrix or series of matrices that encompass comparative metrics: rather than absolute distances relative to a fixed coordinate space. An intuitive <b>representation</b> <b>is</b> the distance matrix, which is a two-dimensional matrix containing all pairwise distances between some subset of the atoms in each structure (such as the alpha carbons). The matrix increases in dimensionality {{as the number of}} structures to be simultaneously aligned increases. Reducing the protein to a coarse metric such as secondary structure elements (SSEs) or structural fragments can also produce sensible alignments, despite the loss of information from discarding distances, as noise is also discarded. Choosing a representation to facilitate computation is critical to developing an efficient alignment mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Of these, the two {{limit of}} {{discrete}} series representations, the discrete series representations, {{and the two}} families of principal series <b>representations</b> <b>are</b> tempered, while the trivial and complementary series <b>representations</b> <b>are</b> not tempered.|$|R

50|$|One of the {{interesting}} property of this notion {{lies in the fact}} that two isotypical <b>representations</b> <b>are</b> either quasi-equivalent or disjoint (in analogy with the fact that irreducible <b>representations</b> <b>are</b> either unitarily equivalent or disjoint).|$|R
5|$|The {{majority}} in the High Court decided that {{although there was no}} right at common law to have publicly provided legal representation in all cases, in some cases <b>representation</b> <b>is</b> appropriate to ensure a fair trial. Although judges no longer have the power to appoint counsel for an accused, since that function has been largely taken over by legal aid agencies, a trial judge should use their power to adjourn a case if it is in the interests of fairness that an accused have representation, which would encourage the legal aid agencies to provide counsel.|$|E
5|$|The {{representation}} of gangsters {{in the literature}} (Drum magazine) went through very different stages during the 1950s and early 1960s. The first <b>representation</b> <b>is</b> characterized by consistent condemnations of crime as an urban phenomenon that threatens the rural identity of tribal blacks. The second is almost a complete turn-around from the first, as gangsters are portrayed as urban survivors {{who are able to}} achieve a standard of living normally denied to blacks. The final period is an extended period of nostalgia for the shebeen culture that all but disappeared with the destruction of Sophiatown.|$|E
5|$|Tiberius {{has been}} {{represented}} in fiction, in literature, film and television, and in video games, {{often as a}} peripheral character in the central storyline. One such modern <b>representation</b> <b>is</b> in the novel I, Claudius by Robert Graves, and the consequent BBC television series adaptation, where he is portrayed by George Baker. George R. R. Martin, the author of The Song of Ice and Fire series, has stated that central character Stannis Baratheon is partially inspired by Tiberius Caesar, and particularly the portrayal by Baker.|$|E
50|$|Polar {{decomposition}} {{shows that}} SL(2,R) = KAK with K = SO(2) and A the subgroup of positive diagonal matrices. K {{corresponds to the}} diagonal matrices in SU(1,1). Since evidently K acts unitarily on Hσ and A acts unitarily on H σ, both <b>representations</b> <b>are</b> unitary. The <b>representations</b> <b>are</b> irreducible because {{the action of the}} Lie algebra on the basis vectors fm is irreducible.

30|$|Representations, then, {{connect the}} sides of the cusp and allow us to ride it. The more <b>representations</b> <b>are</b> consistent, manifesting “local {{interactions}} rather than positive correspondences” with the flux, the more their “instrumental efficacy” allows us to “ride the cusp,” so to speak (ibid.). <b>Representations</b> <b>are</b> ruled by constraints, which do not tell us what reality “in its positivity” is, but can tell us when <b>representations</b> <b>are</b> consistent with reality, enacting some possibilities and enabling certain distinctions instead of others. Constraints, then, operate in the making of selections between those <b>representations</b> which <b>are</b> viable and those which are not (ibid.).|$|R
