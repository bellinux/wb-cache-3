500|$|The film is Spielberg's {{third on}} the subject of alien visitation, along with Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Producer and {{longtime}} collaborator Kathleen Kennedy notes that with War of the Worlds, Spielberg had the opportunity to explore the antithesis of the characters brought to life in E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. [...] "When we first started developing E.T., it was a much edgier, darker story and it actually evolved into something that was more benign. I think that the edgier, darker story has always been somewhere inside him. [...] Now, he's telling that story." [...] Spielberg stated that he just {{thought it would be fun}} to make a [...] "really scary film with <b>really</b> <b>scary</b> aliens", something which he had never done before. Spielberg was intent on telling a contemporary story, with Kennedy stating the story was created as a fantasy, but depicted in a hyper-realistic way.|$|E

500|$|Mackendrick {{shot the}} film in late 1956, and was scared the entire time because Hecht-Hill-Lancaster had a {{reputation}} for firing their directors for any or even no reason at all. The filmmaker was used to extensive rehearsals before a scene was shot and often found himself shooting a script page one or two hours after Odets had written it. Lancaster’s presence proved to be intimidating for numerous individuals involved with the production; at one point, Lehman had been approached to direct the film, but declined due to his fear of Lancaster. Mackendrick and composer Elmer Bernstein both found Lancaster difficult to work with, with Bernstein later recalling, “Burt was <b>really</b> <b>scary.</b> He was a dangerous guy. He had a short fuse.” [...] Mackendrick decided to use Lancaster's volatility to work for the character of JJ, asking that Lancaster wear his own browline glasses, which Mackendrick felt gave him the presence of [...] "a scholarly brute." [...] Mackendrick smeared a thin layer of vaseline on the lenses, preventing Lancaster from focusing his eyes and giving him a perpetually blank gaze; Mackendrick then intentionally filmed scenes with JJ from a low angle using a wide lens with overhead lighting directly above Lancaster, so that the frames cast shadows on his face.|$|E

[...] Wired Kathy Ceceri also noted an artistic similarity to Persepolis; she not only liked how Anya's Ghost intertwined the teenage angst and fantasy elements of the novel, but praised how Anya's desire for a boyfriend doesn't overwhelm the story. [...] Cory Doctorow reviewed Anya's Ghost for Boing Boing, calling it [...] "really sweet, really funny and <b>really</b> <b>scary,</b> [...] a powerful message about identity, fitting in, and the secret selfish bastard lurking in all of us and whether having such a goblin inside makes us irredeemable or merely human." [...] Whitney Matheson with USA Today wrote that Anya's Ghost is a [...] "funny, creepy and a delightful page-turner" [...] and cited author Neil Gaiman who called the novel [...] "a masterpiece". [...] Steve Duin of The Oregonian praised the inventiveness of Brosgol's storytelling, and called her art [...] " [...] little uneven, but... at its best when the lights go out."

And, on the other hand, Napster could be a great way for people to hear your music who wouldn't have the chance to hear it on the radio. So that's what I have to say about that.

5000|$|Maria {{was created}} as a love {{interest}} for Tyrone Dobbs, and first appeared working as a kennel maid at her parents' kennels. Auditions were held for the role in 2000, and actress Samia Ghadie beat several rivals, including singers Kimberley Walsh (of Girls Aloud) and Suzanne Shaw (of Hear'Say), to win the part. Describing Maria's development as a character since her arrival on Coronation Street, the official website states: [...] "Maria has blossomed from working as a kennel maid {{to one of the}} Street's most glamorous young women. She laps up the male attention that her good looks bring her but playing footloose and fancy-free with the men in her life has gained her a bit of a reputation." [...] Jenny Cockle, writing for the Sunday Mirror, has similarly observed that during the character's duration on the show, Maria has evolved from a [...] "dowdy kennel maid" [...] to a [...] "sexy siren". Reflecting on her early days at the programme, Ghadie said: [...] "I thought I'd do my three months and then I'd be off. I was a jobbing actress when I joined and was really pleased to have a job for three months. I never imagined I'd still be here now." [...] Since her arrival at Coronation Street Samia Smith has revealed that she will always be grateful for the opportunities she has been given since she joined. In 2012, Ghadie revealed that she would like to stay at Coronation Street for another ten years, she said to OK! magazine: [...] "I'd be very happy if I was still in Corrie in ten years' time. I think because of everything that has happened {{in the last few years}} I'm trying not to plan too much ahead. I am happy for each day". She also confirmed that she had signed another contract that would keep her in the show til September 2013. Ghadie revealed that it does not feel like she has been on the show for 12 years: [...] "I'm 30 in July so it's quite <b>scary,</b> <b>really!</b> I was 17 when I joined so it just feels like my life is going really quickly!
