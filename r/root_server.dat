2500|$|For the {{iterative}} query procedure, a DNS resolver client will query a {{chain of}} one or more DNS servers. Each server will refer the client to the next server in the chain, until the current server can fully resolve the request. For example, a possible resolution of www.example.com would query a global <b>root</b> <b>server,</b> then a [...] "com" [...] server, and finally an [...] "example.com" [...] server.|$|E
50|$|The DNS {{root zone}} {{is served by}} {{thirteen}} <b>root</b> <b>server</b> clusters which are authoritative for queries to the top-level domains of the Internet. Thus, every name resolution either starts with a query to a <b>root</b> <b>server,</b> or, uses information that was once obtained from a <b>root</b> <b>server.</b>|$|E
50|$|Vixie was a {{software}} engineer at Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) from 1988 - 1993. After he left DEC in 1994, he founded Internet Software Consortium (ISC) together with Rick Adams and Carl Malamud to support BIND and other {{software for the}} Internet. The activities of ISC were assumed by a new company, Internet Systems Consortium in 2004. Although ISC operates the F <b>root</b> <b>server,</b> Vixie at one point joined the Open <b>Root</b> <b>Server</b> Network (ORSN) project and operated their L <b>root</b> <b>server.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{mechanism}} {{would place}} a large traffic {{burden on the}} <b>root</b> <b>servers,</b> if every resolution on the Internet required starting at the root. In practice caching is used in DNS servers to off-load the <b>root</b> <b>servers,</b> and as a result, <b>root</b> name <b>servers</b> actually are involved in {{only a fraction of}} all requests.|$|R
5000|$|Initial VL1 {{peer-to-peer}} {{connection setup}} is faciliated {{by a set}} of global [...] "root servers" [...] operated by ZeroTier, Inc. The software includes the capability to add your own <b>root</b> <b>servers</b> alongside these to reduce dependency on ZeroTier infrastructure or to enable disconnected or air gapped operation. <b>Root</b> <b>servers</b> are simply regular ZeroTier VL1 nodes that are designated as such and that run at stable locations on the network. The existence of a standard set of global <b>root</b> <b>servers</b> allows ZeroTier nodes to instantly bootstrap themselves automatically for zero-configuration networking.|$|R
5000|$|All Internet root nameservers are {{implemented}} as clusters of hosts using anycast addressing. All 13 <b>root</b> <b>servers</b> A-M exist in multiple locations, with 11 on multiple continents. (<b>Root</b> <b>servers</b> B and H exist in two U.S. locations. [...] ) The servers use anycast address announcements {{to provide a}} decentralized service. This has accelerated the deployment of physical (rather than logical) <b>root</b> <b>servers</b> outside the United States. [...] documents the use of anycast addressing to provide authoritative DNS services. Many commercial DNS providers have switched to an IP anycast environment to increase query performance, redundancy, and to implement load balancing.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the possibility of having a (recursive) name server act as a slave to the root zone, rather than caching information after it is requested.

40|$|Every {{time you}} dial into a service {{provider}} network or connect to a wired or wireless network that offers Internet access, {{you are most}} likely using several components of what {{is referred to as}} Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting, or “AAA ” for short. The AAA space is quite complex, so when we asked Sean Convery to give us an overview of these technologies, he decided to divide his survey into two parts. Part One—subtitled “Concepts, Elements, and Approaches”— is included in this issue. Part Two, which discusses protocol details and applications, will follow in our next issue. The Domain Name System (DNS) has been discussed previously in this journal. The most critical part of the DNS is the collection of <b>Root</b> <b>Servers.</b> For protocol reasons, there are only 13 “logical ” <b>root</b> <b>servers,</b> but a system of more than 100 servers has been deployed using a technique known as anycast.
