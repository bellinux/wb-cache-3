This work {{addresses}} {{an urgent}} problem which is saving alloying elements (Ni, Mo, Nb, V, W and others) -which very scarce in Ukraine and other countries- while increasing the physical, mechanical and operational {{properties of the}} new designed and developed wear-resistant cast irons. Optical microscopy, x-ray structure analysis, transmission and scanning (fracture) electron microscopy methods, different-thermal, magnetometric and x-ray analyses, as well as hardness and micro-hardness tests, impact energy, and abrasive wear tests in environments of cast-iron shots were employed in the research. The work summarizes the controlling conditions for forming various metastable phases by including deformation (or strain) induced phase transformation (DIPT) and through realization {{in the process of}} testing.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{semantic}} aspects of the visual description language Phase Model of Production (abbreviated herein as PMP) [3], which {{is used in the}} area of Process Control Engineering. The development, or <b>realization,</b> <b>of</b> <b>process</b> control solutions demands a sufficient detailed knowledge about the processes to be controlled. The means generally used for the design of such solutions often do not satisfy this demand. Therefore, a more qualified description means for processes has been sought after since the middle of the 70 ’s. During this time, according to the phase-oriented model of “Software Life Cycle ” [1], M. Wienand initially named the term Phase Model of Production (one can find references in [3]). The starting point for the Phase Model of Production as a semantic process description is the basic flowsheet according to [2]. In general, the PMP is a graphical, partially formalized form of description for – not only, but mainly – production processes. Because of their plausibility and simple structure, PMPs {{can be used as a}} basis for discussions with all people involved in the planning process, even and especially if they come from different fields of industry. Previous papers about the PMP (e. g. [3],[4],[6]), describe, among other things, the application of this description language for various kinds of processes – nevertheless, they do not handle the different semantics which result nor the different network structures arising from this in detail. Furthermore, as in most visual languages in a software-engineering context, there is a lack of a formal basis for the PMP, especially if it should be used as an inpu...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the role of universities in the innovation process. Against the background of theoretical considerations about the interrelation of innovation and the adaptation of external resources, the effects of university-based (knowledge) resources – together with other exogenous variables – on the innovation input and output of firms in the German manufacturing industry are empirically investigated and evaluated. The estimation results on the innovation input side can be summarized as follows: High assessments to university-based resources and joint R&D with universities increase the probability that firms are engaged {{in the development of}} new products and technologies. Further, the estimations point out stimulating effects of science-related resources on the level of in-house R&D. In general, resources stemming from universities are used as complements in the German manufacturing industry. In-house capacities can be expanded with positive impacts on the probability and the level of R&D activities. The estimation results for the innovation output side are ambiguous: On the one hand, empirical evidence of enhancing impacts of resources stemming from universities on the <b>realization</b> <b>of</b> <b>process</b> innovations has been found. This strengthens the assumption that science-related resources are used to optimize production processes and to save production costs. On the other hand, external resources from the academic sphere have no stimulating effects on the probability of realizing product innovations. University-based resources stimulate the development of new products more indirectly by increasing in-house capacities and enhancing R&D efficiency. But finally, the empirical analysis point out positive impacts of joint R&D with universities on the realization of product innovations. Obviously, collaboration in R&D with universities offer possibilities of efficient knowledge transfer, resource exchange and organizational learning.

The data of this study was taken from the internet, especially from a travel site www. tripadvisor. com. To analyze this study, the researcher uses the framework of M. A. K. Halliday and Matthiessen (1999) and uses descriptive qualitative method. The result showed that there are 24 simple sentences mostly found in the data because the people don’t matter the structure when writing. There are four types of figures and figures of being are the most dominant in the review texts because the people frequently described about the show, how’s the people’s enthusiasm, and the atmosphere of situation and condition in Sentosa Island, Singapore. As stated before, figures of being mostly dominate the data, automatically relational process also dominates the data with participant roles, token and value. Then, type of circumstances mostly dominate in the data is circumstance of manner (quality) because all the people commented {{about the quality of the}} show. The realization of participants mostly exist is simplethings (conscious) because the people often told about themselves when they visited that show, the <b>realization</b> <b>of</b> <b>process</b> mostly exist in the data is polar: non-phasal verbs in present tense because most of people often applied non-phasal verbs in their writing and they also often described what “Songs of the Sea” is like so that tenses which was frequently used is present tense, meanwhile for the realization of circumstance mostly existed in the data is macro circumstances because in the data is found so many circumstances which have more than one word.

40|$|Summary. Food fibres are {{included}} in the list of useful substances necessary for the normal functioning of human organism. It is part of products, that the enzymes of stomach and bowels are unable to overcook. There are they in fruit, vegetables, skin of bobs, and as early as shell of seed and cereals. In Russian Federation the valuable source of pectin is a sugar-beet bagasse, because other types of pectin-containing raw material can not compete with it on a low cost and present resources. A sugar-beet pectin possesses a high protective action, i. e. by ability to destroy poisonous substances and radionuclides from an organism. In spite of deficit of pectin in Russia, considerable home production them is presently absent. The methods of production of pectin offered before were bulky, with the low level of apparatus-technological registration and considerable expenses of reagents does not provide the favourable terms of labour with considerable ecological problems. The aim of work is perfection of the modes of receipt of pectin from a sugar-beet bagasse with using as an extractant of the electrochemically activated water. Application of such method allows to soften the process of hydrolysis-extracting, that assists not only the increase of exit and quality of pectin but also gives an opportunity of the further processing of raw material on food fibres. As a result of undertaken studies the modes of <b>realization</b> <b>of</b> <b>process</b> of hydrolysis-extracting of pectin are worked out from a digister. A pectin from a sugar-beet bagasse differs in high maintenance of free carboxyl groups, the use is possible as the complexing agent in a medical and preventive feed.

Such technology answers the requirements of ecological safety of production, carries innovative character, assists the decision of problem of the complex use of digister and market entry functional ingredients and bioactive additions of home inexpensive preparations of the complex setting...|$|E
