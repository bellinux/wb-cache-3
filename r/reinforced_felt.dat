Many or most spider egg cases are partly or largely felted silk as well as woven or wound. The lids of various species of trapdoor spider burrows vary in their construction, but they are largely of earth and similar material <b>reinforced</b> with partly <b>felted</b> silk.|$|R
5000|$|The {{period between}} {{the launch of the}} {{election}} and polling was short. The main interest occurred when Michael Heseltine publicly and strongly endorsed Major, which many commentators <b>felt</b> <b>reinforced</b> his position. Redwood's leadership bid came under much fire. His campaign slogan was [...] "No change, no chance". A poster was issued on his behalf, written by Redwood's campaign manager David Evans, which urged Conservatives to vote Redwood to [...] "Save Your Seat, Save Your Party, and Save Your Country".|$|R
50|$|At {{odds with}} his placid, remissive ways was his virulent and {{over-the-top}} anti-communism which {{stemmed from the}} trauma of losing his father during the Russian revolution, the trauma of exile and the meager life in Rome which followed it.This odd trait helped his popularity among Italian low and middle bourgeoisie, who <b>felt</b> <b>reinforced</b> in their social prejudices, but hampered his critical success in Italy; international critics (especially in France) did overlook this facet of his style and praised him when at home he was considered {{nothing more than a}} genre writer.|$|R

Cellini, the sole survivor of the Ultra Probe mission, returned to Earth speaking of his ordeal with a deadly space 'dragon' lifeform in a spaceship graveyard {{on the far side of}} planet Ultra. Her report, she <b>felt,</b> <b>reinforced</b> the already overwhelming case against Cellini, who was the Commission's scapegoat for the failure of the high-profile and expensive space mission.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAbdominal aortic {{aneurysm}} with arteritis in ankylosing spondylitis is described. An abdominal {{aortic aneurysm}}, 48 -mm in diameter, in a 68 -year-old woman with HLA-B 27 –associated ankylosing spondylitis was successfully {{replaced with a}} tube graft. The suture lines of the aortic wall were <b>reinforced</b> with Teflon <b>felt</b> strips. Pathologic examination of the aneurysmal wall revealed hyalinization of the connective tissue, with numerous lymphocytic infiltrates, remarkable calcification, and no elastic fibers. The original structure of the arterial wall was not recognized. These findings are compatible with aortitis reported in ankylosing spondylitis...|$|R
5000|$|The Duke of Somerset, the First Lord of the Admiralty, opposed Palmerston's {{inclination}} to <b>reinforce</b> Milne. He <b>felt</b> {{that the existing}} force made up largely of steam ships was superior to the primarily sail ships of the Union fleet, and {{he was reluctant to}} incur additional expenses while Britain {{was in the process of}} rebuilding her fleet with iron ships. This resistance by Parliament and the cabinet led historian Kenneth Bourne to conclude, [...] "When, therefore the news of the Trent outrage arrived in England the British were still not properly prepared for the war which almost everyone agreed was inevitable if the Union did not back down." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of silica aerogels reinforced with either carbon or silica fiber felts and which encapsulate the lipase PS of Amano (LPS AB 025407) obtained from Burkholderia cepacia is described. The materials were further shaped by molding them in Teflon tubes. The silica aerogels were synthesized with various ratios of hydrophobic groups and dried {{according to the}} supercrit. CO 2 method. Both types of reinforcements improve the catalytic activity of the material per mass of lipase. The fiber felts reinforcements also enable the encapsulation of higher concns. of lipase. The materials were shaped into small molded monoliths, which were readily washed and recycled without significant mech. deterioration or loss of catalytic activity. In addn., hydrophobic carbon <b>felts</b> <b>reinforce</b> more efficiently silica aerogels that incorporate a high ratio of hydrophobic groups, while silica felts strengthen those aerogels that carry a low proportion of hydrophobic groups...|$|R
40|$|Background:Considering huge {{burden of}} RTI across {{community}} based study settings- either iatrogenic or endogenous {{and not necessarily}} sexually transmitted, menstrual hygiene practices by reproductive age group women have documented evidence of being a key determinant/ predictor of RTI and bear causal association with key Socio-demographic attributes. This is more so in view of vulnerability to health risk, access to treatment and reduced economical choice for a marginal & disadvantaged population like the ‘in-migrants/itinerants. Objectives: 1. To study menstrual hygiene practices of ever-married ‘in-migrant’ women from Dehradun as a key determinant of reproductive health needs. 2. To establish causal association between menstrual hygiene practices and (i) key socio-demographic attributes & (ii) RTI. Methodology: An observational (cross-sectional) study was designed with a probability sample from 5033 ever-married women from 06 ‘make-shift settlements’/slums along immediate precincts i. e 50 meters into the mainland from the banks of rivers ‘Chandrabhaga’, ‘Ganga’, ‘Song’ and ‘Rispana’- all {{in the district of}} Dehradun. Result& Conclusion: The present study findings revealed that as key determinant of reproductive health needs, menstrual hygiene practices of the study population bore significant statistical association with their (i) literacy status or education (ii) religion (iii) key reproductive tract infection symptoms and (iv) socio-economic status. The findings <b>reinforced</b> the <b>felt</b> need to address knowledge, attitude and practices of the disadvantaged study population by appropriate behaviour change communication, build community & provider capacity and strategies to deliver services at such resource - poor setting keeping in view the four A’s of primary health care...|$|R
5000|$|He relaxed some uniform rules, but {{maintained}} {{rules that}} he <b>felt</b> <b>reinforced</b> school spirit, such as boys {{being required to}} attend inter-school sports fixtures as spectators. As at Shrewsbury, he did not abolish fagging or the rights of older boys to beat younger boys, but at Bradfield he reduced both. Even after his minor reforms, new boys were still caned by prefects for [...] "talking after lights out", [...] "misbehaviour in the dining hall", [...] "insolence to a prefect", and similar transgressions. The prefects themselves received Chenevix-Trench's harsher rules themselves in some areas, though; he expelled the Head of School (head boy) for smoking on school transport after an official sports fixture. Other aspects of his approach were more controversial, even for the times. Chenevix-Trench's biographer, Mark Peel, stated that [...] "although Tony's efforts to rid the school of homosexuality by engaging in a massive beating spree were {{seen by many as}} discrimination towards the non-robust boys, only the minority appears to have been alienated". His mixture of corporal punishment with close friendship continued, with some recipients of the cane offered an alcoholic drink immediately afterwards.|$|R
40|$|The Koori Fathering Program was {{developed}} in response to demand from local Aboriginal organisations and individuals to improve the health and wellbeing of their communities. Family functioning was a stated priority and specific requests were made for training around parenting skills and relationships. A literature review <b>reinforced</b> this <b>felt</b> need by highlighting how the quality of early childhood experiences, including parenting style, affects children’s social, cognitive, emotional and physical development and wellbeing and, consequently, their overall physical and mental wellbeing throughout their lives. An extensive local mapping process found that, although many parenting programs were available, Aboriginal men were not accessing them. Informal community consultations indicated this was largely because Aboriginal fathers found the existing programs to be too female-oriented, not culturally-relevant, difficult to access and insensitive when classes were missed due to family or community crises. Another extensive search found few parenting programs designed specifically for men and even less for Aboriginal men. Indeed, fathers had, generally, {{been identified as a}} group requiring further attention when developing parenting programs as they were not being easily accommodated within current early intervention and parent support programs and services. The literature review did, however, identify a number of issues and principles of importance when developing Aboriginal parenting programs, as well as some key elements of successful parenting programs. The findings of these literature reviews, along with comprehensive feedback from a number of focus groups with local Aboriginal men, were used to develop the Koori Fathering Program – a 15 -week course offering Aboriginal men and, indirectly, their partners and children, a new beginning by supporting them to: • develop more positive relationships with their children; • develop more positive relationships with their partners, or ex-partners; • improve their understanding of children’s development and needs; • understand and accept the responsibility of fatherhood; • improve their communication skills; • understand the importance of showing affection; and • learn and practise effective, positive discipline strategies...|$|R
40|$|Pipe {{rehabilitation}} and trenchless pipe replacement technologies {{have been used}} more than 40 years. Cured-in placepipe (CIPP) is a trenchless method to repair damaged pipelines by inserting a new liner of polymer inside the existing host pipe. Since these liners are exposed to water after installation, {{the purpose of this}} study is to investigate the effect of water aging on CIPP samples. The water absorption analyses have been performed by immersion of unsaturated polyester composites <b>reinforced</b> with needle <b>felt</b> samples in distilled water according to ASTM D 570 / 98. The effect of aging is inspected on one hand via comparison of their images obtained through an optic microscope and their weights before and after aging and on the other hand through non-destructive testing using microwaves. The microwaves were used in the frequency range of 75 - 100 GHz in non-contact manner. For this a vectorial network analyser (VNWA) and a frequency-modulated continuous wave radar (FMCW radar) was used to enable an accurate and broadband measurement. In this case the effect of water induced aging appears as a change in run time, which results from a change in permittivity of the material being inspected. The results of the optic microscopic images and weights prove that water absorption is present in the CIPP samples considered...|$|R
