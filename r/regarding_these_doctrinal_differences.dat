50|$|<b>These</b> <b>doctrinal</b> issues {{center around}} the Orthodox {{perception}} that the Catholic theologians lack the actual experience of God called theoria and thereby fail to {{understand the importance of}} the heart as a noetic or intuitive faculty. It is what they consider to be the Catholic Church's reliance on pagan metaphysical philosophy and rational methods such as scholasticism rather than on intuitive experience of God (theoria) that causes Orthodox to consider the Catholic Church heretical. Other points of <b>doctrinal</b> <b>difference</b> include a difference regarding human nature as well as a difference regarding original sin, purgatory, and the nature of Hell.|$|R

5000|$|The {{document}} {{acknowledges that}} there are serious problems facing prospects of reunion with Reformation communities that make no attempt to claim apostolic succession such as the Anglican communion does.

Other communities have insoluble <b>doctrinal</b> <b>differences</b> with Catholic Christianity because their theology of the Holy Trinity is manifestly incompatible with {{the doctrine of the}} council of Nicea in the early Church.

5000|$|Some Christians view denominationalism as a regrettable fact. As of 2011, {{divisions}} are becoming less sharp, {{and there is}} increasing cooperation between denominations.
