In February 2017, Languiller {{was found to}} have been {{claiming}} a second <b>residence</b> <b>allowance</b> for a house in Queenscliff, and later resigned his position. Questioned by the media about the allowance, Nardella conceded he had claimed around $100,000 of the same allowance for a house in Ocean Grove, and announced he would resign as deputy speaker on the same day as Languiller.

40|$|Deployment of {{resident}} female Community Health Extension Workers (CHEWs) to {{a remote}} rural community led to major and sustained increases in service utilization, including antenatal care and facility-based deliveries. Key components to success: (1) providing an additional rural <b>residence</b> <b>allowance</b> to help recruit and retain CHEWs; (2) posting the female CHEWs in pairs to avoid isolation and provide mutual support; (3) ensuring supplies and transportation means for home visits; and (4) allowing CHEWs to perform deliveries. Introduction: Nigeria {{has one of the}} highest maternal mortality ratios in the world. Poor health outcomes are linked to weak health infrastructure, barriers to service access, and consequent low rates of service utilization. In the northern state of Jigawa, a pilot study was conducted to explore the feasibility of deploying resident female Community Health Extension Workers (CHEWs) to rural areas to provide essential maternal, newborn, and child health services. Methods: Between February and August 2011, a quasi-experimental design compared service utilization in the pilo...|$|R

5000|$|As a non-EU member {{country but}} full {{participant}} in the Schengen Agreement, the Swiss Federation was directly affected by the migrant crisis {{with most of the}} refugees arriving from Italy at border crossings in the Southern Kantons of Ticino and Valais. In the crisis year 2015, almost 40,000 asylum seekers were applying for refugee status. In 2016, this number dropped by 31%, and {{in the first quarter of}} 2017 by another 57%, compared to the same time period in 2016. Most of the asylum seekers arriving in Switzerland originate from Eritrea (49%), followed by Afghanistan (30%) and Syria. Despite relative restrictive admission policies, and increased patrolling of illegal border crossings, the Swiss have attempted to admit refugees throughout the course of the migrant crisis, and distributed those asylum seekers to the appropriate kantons and city states. Refugees first receive a temporary residence permit [...] "N" [...] valid for 6 months while they await approval of their status. Asylum seekers who are not admitted but cannot return to their home country because of health or safety considerations receive a residence permit [...] "F" [...] that allows them to stay in Switzerland. Persons receiving a [...] "B" [...] permit are admitted refugees according to the Geneva Convention with a full <b>residence</b> <b>allowance</b> for 12 months and possible extensions. Almost 50% of the asylum seekers receive residence permits or are allowed to stay, and about 10% of those rejected can be placed in another Schengen country. With 3.4 asylum seekers per 1000 inhabitants in 2016, Switzerland processed more asylum applications than the European average at 2.5, Germany at the top of the list with almost 10 asylum seekers/1000. About 2.5% of asylum seekers in Switzerland are employed; the numbers are higher at 30% for those with temporary permits and at 24% for admitted refugees.|$|R

5000|$|The Governor of Massachusetts is {{the chief}} {{executive}} of the Commonwealth, and is supported by a number of subordinate officers. He, like most other state officers, senators, and representatives, was originally elected annually. In 1918 this was changed to a two-year term, and since 1966 the office of governor has carried a four-year term. The Governor of Massachusetts does not receive a mansion, other official <b>residence,</b> or housing <b>allowance.</b> Instead, he resides in his own private residence. The title [...] "His Excellency" [...] is a throwback to the royally appointed governors of the Province of Massachusetts Bay. The first governor to use the title was Richard Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont, in 1699; since he was an Earl, it was thought proper to call him [...] "Your Excellency." [...] The title was retained until 1742, when an order from King George II forbade its further use. However, the framers of the state constitution revived it because they found it fitting to dignify the governor with this title.|$|R
