40|$|Abstract: We {{demonstrate}} {{learning and}} problem-solving transfer between <b>related</b> <b>physics</b> problems using the Socratic web-based tutor, MasteringPhysics. Two equally skilled {{groups of students}} taking introductory mechanics solve <b>related</b> <b>physics</b> problem pairs in reverse order with respect to each other. We show that for problems containing help (“skill builders ” and “self tutoring problems”) {{in the form of}} requestable hints, descriptive text, and feedback, twice as many students were able to complete problems correctly in real time compared to problems that did not provide any help (end-of-chapter problems). The group that did a problem second (prepared group) in a given related pair was able to solve it in ~ 15 % less time on average compared to the group that did the same problem first (unprepared group). Furthermore, the prepared group requests 7 % fewer hints on average than the unprepared group. We conclude that learning and problem-solving transfer is facilitated through skill builders and self tutoring problems, which also are pedagogically superior to end-of-chapter problems...|$|E
