40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the efficacy of}} 4 different oral hygiene regimens involving adjunctive interdental cleaning devices in unsupervised young subjects with intact interdental papilla. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty periodontally healthy subjects were randomly allocated to 4 groups following different oral hygiene regimens (T- 7) : use of manual toothbrush alone; manual toothbrush plus dental floss; manual toothbrush plus interdental brushes; and manual toothbrush plus rubber interdental picks. Oral hygiene instructions (OHI) were given. One week after (T 0), professional supragingival scaling and polishing was performed, and subjects were then <b>reseen</b> every 2 weeks (T 14 and T 28). At T- 7, T 0, T 14 and T 28, full-mouth plaque score (FMPS), full-mouth bleeding score (FMBS) and angulated bleeding index (AngBI) were taken. RESULTS: During the first week (T- 7 /T 0 unclean phase), FMPS decreased significantly in all groups except the group using dental floss. At T 28, {{a significant decrease in}} FMPS (P <. 001, all groups) and FMBS (P <. 05, all groups except the group using flossing P <. 001) was noted. Interdental FMPS showed significantly lower values in subjects treated with interdental brushes or rubber interdental picks vs toothbrushing alone (P <. 05). The use of interdental picks was associated with reduced interdental FMBS when compared to flossing (P <. 05). CONCLUSION: In young subjects, with no interdental attachment loss, toothbrushing or toothbrushing and adjunctive interdental cleaning devices such as dental floss, interdental brushes or interdental rubber picks can significantly reduce both plaque and gingival inflammation. Use of interdental brushes or rubber picks reduces more interdental plaque in comparison with toothbrushing alone...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of a comparative {{case study of}} contemporary Irish and Ukrainian women's poetry is to establish some typological features of decolonizing female poetic discourses targeted to resist dominant cultural systems by decomposing the coherence of master narratives. A comparative study of female and male discourses that determines the frame of reference provides {{an understanding of the}} principles and techniques of re-interpretation and appropriation of canonic poetic models and literary stereotypes. Women's revolt against limited personal viewing-space prescribed and controlled by a dominant system of representation is regarded as their struggle for interpretive power. The strategies employed by Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill and Lina Kostenko in re-articulating the symbolic meaning of re-worked texts and in re-textualizing nation/identity formative cultural "archetypes," allow them to establish their poetic genealogies and to write women into history and tradition. Ni Dhomhnaill's negotiations of the ideas concerning identity are carried along the "channels of Irish psychohistory" to Irish warrior-queens and sovereignty goddesses, to traditional landscape imagery of Ireland-as-body, and to the assertion of her personal landscape/inscape of the body. Kostenko's identity quest materializes in a baroque-type martyr-drama of her "imaginative history" of Ukraine, instrumental in rethinking and <b>reseeing</b> the past and common origins and in defining national/personal symbolic lineages. Both poets find liberation from rigid, rationalistic schemes by establishing their synchronic order, opposed to diachronism, where time becomes reversible and disturbingly movable.

From the Thorpes she could learn nothing, for they had been only two days in Bath before they met with Mrs. Allen.

The thickness data were distributed to all PCs at the instant of measurement by way of wireless transmitters attached to calipers. There was statistical evidence in the study that suggested that the average thickness of 4 / 4 ash (Frainus car-oliniana) declined by 0. 060 " and the average thickness of 4 / 4 cottonwood (Populus deltoider) declined by approximately 0. 035 " at Mill # 2.

However, the process of eliciting expertise from an expert, knowledge acquisition, is recognized as the principal bottleneck in expert system development. This research explores the use of simulation for identifying knowledge for expert systems. With its capability for allowing experimentation on a model of a real system, computer simulation can be used to search for the best knowledge (strategies, constraints, scenarios, etc.), from among a set of alternatives, that optimizes system performance. Although developing high-level abstractions for decision schema that would be applicable to a large set of problem domains is desirable, it is extremely difficult. The focus of this study is the sawmill industry. A moderately complex and typical sawmill simulation system is modeled and used as a basis for developing a knowledge base to improve the material flow for the sawmill. The system components included in the system model are the bucksaw, debarker, headrig, gangsaw, flitch edger, and <b>resaw.</b> The inputs to the system are raw material mix, order file, product price, and operating times. The expert system's knowledge base is a set of operating policies which relate the constraints and actions in the form of production rules.

The methodology of using simulation for identifying knowledge for expert systems is developed. Simulation experiments are conducted and rules are generated based on the simulation system performance. The rules are recorded in an initial knowledge base and tested for interaction effects.

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Sawmills {{are very}} complex systems that involve many {{manufacturing}} processes. The variability of their raw material adds further to this complexity as each log has characteristics that determine its processing path. Therefore, computer simulation {{is a very}} useful technique for analyzing sawmill performance. This thesis describes a simulation computer model of the Warm Springs Forest Products Industries sawmill. This model was implemented to improve general sawmill manufacturing processes {{as well as to}} quantify the effect of adding more small diameter timber into the mill's raw material log mix. The WSFPI sawmill includes two primary process centers, the headrig for processing large logs and the end-dogging log feeding system, or EDLF, for processing smaller logs (less than 17 "). The focus of this study is mainly on the small-log side of the sawmill. For an analysis of the sawmill's large log processing system, see "Using discrete-event simulation to study the influence of log yard sorting on sawmill processing efficiency of small diameter timber" (Pinon 2005). The model was implemented using the Arena discrete-event simulation software package. The influence of log characteristics such as diameter and length was included in the model. The model also included simplifications of the real system to facilitate the mill's simulation. Data was collected for different sawmill Results showed that downtimes had a significant influence on sawmill production. Removing downtimes for the trimmer or the EDLF proved to significantly increase production while the other machines' downtimes had no significant influence on production. Investigations into the effect of increasing the EDLF ' s processing speed were also conducted and showed that for the current log distribution, increasing its speed produced no significant increase in production. However, if more smalldiameter material were processed, a significant increase in production was observed. Increasing the gang edger's speed along with the EDLF's speed was also investigated. A significant increase in production was observed but was limited by the other machine centers that could not process the higher material flow (unscrambler, trimmer, board-edger, and horizontal <b>resaw).</b> Higher percentages of small diameter timber are expected as part of the sawmill's future log supply. Simulation runs were conducted to estimate the production loss due to this change, and they showed a significant decrease in production. Those results suggest that machine center changes would be required to offset the production lost from processing greater amounts of small diameter timber...|$|E

The corpora are specialized {{in the sense that they}} only address a particular text genre or source at a time. Web crawling techniques are used to download the documents, then they are stored roughly in the way web archives do. More precisely, I {{would like to}} talk about two cases where texts are expected to be republishable: a "standard" case, political speeches, and a "borderline" case, German blogs under CC license. The work is performed in the context of a digital dictionary of German. The primary user base consists of lexicographers, who need valuable or at least exploitable evidence, in the form of precise quotes or definition elements. The actual gathering and processing of the corpora is described elsewhere (anonymized references). In this talk I would like to focus on a series of challenges that are to be solved in order to make data from web archives accessible to researchers and to study web text corpora: metadata extraction, quality assurance, licensing, and "scientificity". 1. A proper metadata extraction is needed in order to make further downstream applications possible. It has to be performed meticulously, since experience shows that even small or rare mistakes in date encoding for instance may cause the application to be disregarded or discarded by researchers in the humanities, since linguistic trends cannot be identified properly if the content is not ordered in time. Easily available metadata in the case of speeches constrast with different content types, encodings, and markup patterns concerning the blogs. Compromises have to be made without sacrificing recall, since republishable texts are rather rare. 2. Regarding the content, quality assurance is paramount, since a high quality is expected by users, all the more since they may feel reluctant to use web texts for their studies. In fact, providing "Hi-Fi" web corpora also means promoting the cause of web sources and modernization of research methodology. 3. The results are hosted in Germany, and thus German copyright laws apply, which can be considered to be more restrictive than others. Additionally, there are a number of issues with licensing in general and CC licenses in particular, even with manual verification: the CC ND and (to a lesser extent) NC predicates can hinder proper republication. There are also potential copyright issues regarding blog comments. To sum up the issues described above, much work flows into ensuring the "scientificity" of web texts and making the texts not only available but also citable in a scholarly sense...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2006 A sawmill {{is similar}} to other {{manufacturing}} enterprises {{when it comes to}} making decisions, scheduling production and meeting customer demands. In order to help sawmills achieve their goals, and because there is such a high degree of variability in the raw material used in this industry, computer simulation has proven to be a very valuable tool to help improve productivity and processing efficiency. Raw material variability is expected to be an increasing issue in coming years due to an increase in small-diameter timber on the market resulting from the thinning of overstocked forest stands. These changes are expected to result in a significant decrease in production for mills that are not equipped to process this type of material. As a means of analyzing the influence of these changes, this thesis details the development and use of a discrete-event computer simulation model of the Warm Springs Forest Products Industries sawmill in Warm Springs, OR. This research is part of a larger project in which other improvement scenarios were studied (Salichon 2005). The simulation model was first used to identify some possible areas of improvement and to optimize the current overall process and production of the sawmill while operating with its current log distribution. The study identified a number of opportunities for improvement. It was demonstrated that increasing the unscrambler maximum capacity up to 800 boards resulted in an increase in piece count production ranging from 2. 6 to 5. 3 %. The influence of machines downtimes as well as the influence of having a second operator assisting at the horizontal <b>resaw</b> were also investigated. Past studies have shown that log sorting is an essential condition to achieve high production in a sawmill. The simulation model was used to evaluate sorting strategies that would minimize the decrease in production resulting from introducing small-diameter timber (5 to 7 inches) into the log supply. Different small-diameter distributions were tried and different sorting solutions were tested for each of the log distributions. It was shown that the mill would suffer a decrease in piece count production ranging from 10. 1 to 13. 1 % if their current two decks sort is retained. However, it was demonstrated that implementing a three decks sort would considerably reduce this drop in production to only 4. 7 to 6. 4 %. Simulation has been shown to be a very valuable tool that sawmills can use to investigate production and other log supply issues. While piece count production was sufficient for analyzing current mill efficiency changes, the introduction of smaller diameter logs will also reduce the board feet per piece ratio. Due to the loss of the trimmer data during the test run, no information can be provided about board footage and thus the results and statistics in this research were based on piece count only. However, future work could be done with log breakdown models like BOF or SAW 3 D to determine board footage. Future research could also focus on studying the influence of the trimmer's downtimes on the unscrambler queue and other machine utilization rates as well as testing mathematical algorithms that will search for other optimized sorting and feeding strategies...|$|E
