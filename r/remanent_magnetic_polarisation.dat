In this paper, how structure-sensitive {{parameters}} {{derived from}} the hysteresis loop, like coercive field, remanent induction, and hysteresis losses, {{can be used to}} characterise recovery and recrystallization in cold rolled Ti-Nb stabilised interstitial free ultra low carbon steel is shown. The effect on hysteresis measurements of isothermal annealing treatments applied to industrially cold rolled samples at different temperatures is related to the microstructural changes which take place during the annealing {{as a consequence of the}} metallurgical recovery and recrystallization processes. It has been observed that the <b>remanent</b> <b>magnetic</b> field, the coercive field and the hysteresis losses can be used to monitor recovery. Furthermore, recrystallization can be characterised by coercive field and hysteresis loss measurements. Additionally, the effect on magnetic parameters of hardness indentations made after the annealing is studied.

40|$|As {{the solar}} wind is {{incident}} upon the lunar surface, it will occasionally encounter lunar crustal <b>remanent</b> <b>magnetic</b> fields. These magnetic fields are small-scale, highly non-dipolar, have strengths up to hundreds of nanotesla, and typically interact with {{the solar wind}} in a kinetic fashion. Simulations, theoretical analyses, and spacecraft observations have shown that crustal fields can reflect solar wind protons via a combination of magnetic and electrostatic reflection; however, analyses of surface properties have suggested that protons may still access the lunar surface in the cusp regions of crustal magnetic fields. In this first report from a planned series of studies, we use a 1 1 / 2 -dimensional, electrostatic particle-in-cell code to model the self-consistent interaction between the solar wind, the cusp regions of lunar crustal <b>remanent</b> <b>magnetic</b> fields, and the lunar surface.

40|$|A strong {{influence}} of external magnetic fields on the relaxation time constant T 1 of glass cells serving as 3 He neutron spin filters, observed for different glass types in alkali metal coated cells, was initially {{associated with the}} presence {{of a large number of}} ferromagnetic clusters on the glass surface. Later experiments showed the presence of the so called T 1 hysteresis phenomenon with a similar distinctiveness also in uncoated cells made of pure synthetic quartz glass. It suggests that the origin of such relaxation is a macroscopic magnetisation in the bulk material of the cell. We present the results of a multi SQUID system investigation on magnetised and non magnetised quartz glass cells, Cs coated as well as bare wall, to be used as neutron spin filters at HMI Berlin. The presence of a macroscopic <b>remanent</b> <b>magnetic</b> moment in the cells after their exposition to external magnetic fields has been experimentally shown.

By contrast, linearly decreasing the field strength or stepping the field down without alternating the field direction leaves the arrays with a larger <b>remanent</b> <b>magnetic</b> moment.
