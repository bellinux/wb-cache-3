Mariah the chanter {{flawlessly}} adapts to their singsong style, largely boxing her multi-octave range into a sly, hypnotic melody so that when she really wails at the end, you <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> it.

Armstrong described the environment: [...] "For the first time, we separated from our pasts, from how {{we were supposed to}} behave as Green Day. For the first time, we fully accepted the fact that we're rock stars." [...] American Idiot took ten months to complete, at a cost of $650,000.

500|$|Obviously we knew {{people were}} going to totally sensationalize it. They're {{beautiful}} girls, the scene is hot—I'm not afraid to say that. There is a sexual energy between the girls which is kind of authentic, because I know when I was a teen-aged girl, the friendships that I had with other girls were almost romantic, they were so intense. I wanted to sleep at my friend's house every night, I wanted to wear her clothes, we would talk on the phone until our ears ached. I wanted to capture that heightened feeling you get as an adolescent that you don't <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> as a grownup.

500|$|Writing for Game Informer, Andrew Reiner {{said that}} the game's {{interactive}} storytelling encourages replay and that its detailed story [...] "makes the relationships feel real—you care about your crew, and you <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> {{like you have a}} voice that resonates throughout the galaxy." [...] Alex Dale of CVG stated similar pros, stating that [...] "never before has storytelling been so competently ingrained into a videogame, and never before has a player had so much freedom to dictate the course of a linear storyline." [...] Similar praise was given to the game's detailed character models, facial animations, and voice acting. Jennifer Tsao of 1UP.com felt the digital actors evoked real-life expressions, but admitted that the lip sync had some issues. Although the visuals were credited for their dramatic set pieces and evocative soundtrack, critics noted the game's inconsistent frame rate and long loading times.|$|E

David Browne from Entertainment Weekly praised the song, writing [...] "for {{most of the}} album she keeps her notorious octave-climbing chops at bay.

In 'Breakdown', she demonstrates she can match the staccato, lite-reggae phrasing of her guests, two members of Bone Thugs-n-Harmony." [...] Rich Juzwiak from Slant called [...] "Breakdown" [...] "the song of Carey's career," [...] noting its [...] "lyrical strokes [...] as broad and obvious as they are naked.
