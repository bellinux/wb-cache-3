40|$|A {{promising}} type {{of steel}} slag for applications is the ladle furnace (LF) slag, {{which is also}} known as the basic slag, the <b>reducing</b> <b>slag,</b> the white slag, and the secondary refining slag. The LF slag is a byproduct from further refining molten steel after coming out of a basic oxygen furnace (BOF) or an electric arc furnace (EAF). The use of the LF slag in further applications requires knowledge of its characteristics. The LF slag characterization in this paper has been performed using the following analytical methods: chemical analysis by energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), mineralogical composition by X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface area properties by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods, surface chemistry by infrared absorption (FTIR) spectroscopy, and morphological analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that the main compounds are calcium, silicon, magnesium, and aluminium oxides, and calcium silicates under their various allotropic forms are the major compounds in the LF slag. Surface area properties have shown that the LF slag is a mesoporous material with relatively great BET surface area.

40|$|Ash {{transformation}} processes {{have been}} studied during co-firing of wheat straw and pine stem wood and softwood bark. Pilot-scale trials in a 150 kW pulverised-fuel-fired burner were performed. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were made to support {{the interpretation of the}} results. The results show that fast reactions involving gaseous ash compounds are favored at the expense of reactions where condensed components participate. Accordingly, the conditions promote gas phase reactions resulting in the formation of chlorides, sulfate and carbonates whereas reactions involving condensed reactants are suppressed. Both the slagging and fouling propensity of all co-firing mixes was reduced compared to that for pure straw. For the wood/straw mixes this was mainly due to a dilution of the ash forming elements of straw whereas for straw/bark, an additional effect from interaction between the fuel ash components was observed to primarily <b>reduce</b> <b>slagging.</b> In general it can be concluded that under powder combustion conditions equilibrium are approached selectively and that the ash matter are strongly fractionated.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to measure Tc sorption to cementitious materials under reducing conditions to simulate Saltstone Disposal Facility conditions. Earlier studies were conducted and the experimental conditions were found not to simulate those of the facility. Through a five month subcontract with Clemson University, sorption of {sup 99 }Tc to four cementitious materials was examined within an anaerobic glovebag targeting a 0. 1 % H 2 (g) / 99. 9 % N{sub 2 }(g) atmosphere. Early experiments based on Tc sorption and Eh indicated that 0. 1 % H{sub 2 }(g) (a reductant) was necessary to preclude experimental impacts from O{sub 2 }(g) diffusion into the glovebag. Preliminary data to date (up to 56 days) indicates that sorption of {sup 99 }Tc to cementitious materials increased with increasing slag content for simulated saltstone samples. This is consistent with the conceptual model that redox active sulfide groups within the <b>reducing</b> <b>slag</b> facilitate reduction of Tc(VII) to Tc(IV). These experiments differ from previous experiments where a 2 % H{sub 2 }(g) atmosphere was maintained (Kaplan et al., 2011 (SRNL-STI- 2010 - 00668)). The impact of the 2 % H{sub 2 }(g) reducing atmosphere on this data was examined and determined to cause the reduction of Tc in experimental samples without slag. In the present ongoing study, after 56 days, Tc sorption by the 50 -year old cement samples (no slag) was undetectable, whereas Tc sorption in the cementitious materials containing slag continues to increase with contact time (measured after 1, 4, 8, 19 and 56 days). Sorption was not consistent with spike concentrations and steady state has not been demonstrated after 56 days. The average conditional K{sub d} value for the Vault 2 cementitious material was 6, 362 mL/g (17 % slag), for the TR 547 Saltstone (45 % slag) the conditional K{sub d} was 1258 mL/g, and for TR 545 (90 % slag) the conditional K{sub d} was 12, 112 mL/g.

40|$|Increase in the COz {{concentration}} in atmosphere {{due to the}} combustion of fossil fuels has caused serious global warming. In dealing with this issue, the absorption of COz into EAF steelmaking slag was experimentally studied by the utilization of mechanical grinding method. The final objective {{of this research is}} to develop a new mineral carbonation process that has a high efficiency in the capture and storage of C 02 with low energy consumption {{and at the same time}} has some value added features that leads to the feasibility of the overall carbonation system. In the first stage of this study, the absorption behavior of C 02 into metal powders and CaO contained material was studied by dry grinding in a centrifugal ball mill. It was found that COz was not decomposed during the grinding, but the sorption of it occurred on the ground sample. In both cases of CaO and waste concrete, formation of CaC 03 was confirmed. While, in the case of metal powders, the COz absorption into ground powders was firstly occurred, thereafter, it decomposed to form metal oxides and carbon. COz sorption into the samples depended on the newly exposed surface area that was formed by grinding. It was found that the newly exposed surface area increased linearly with the increase in the grinding time. However, the dry grinding resulted to the agglomeration of particles in the latter stage of grinding. The agglomeration of particles has then led to the limitation of the COz absorption. In the next stage, the behavior of C 02 absorption into EAF normal and stainless steel <b>reducing</b> <b>slag</b> was investigated with wet grinding method. The slag was wet ground under COz atmosphere by a vibrating ball mill which has larger capacity than the centrifugal ball mill. The amount and the initial rate of C 02 absorption for the wet grinding were higher than those for the dry grinding. The optimum ratio of fillings to vessel's volume was found to be aboct 112. C 02 was stored into the slag mainly as CaC 03 and EO desorption of C 02 was observed. Thus, this indicates that the C 02 can be stored permanently inside the slag with this method. This study also revealed that the increase in the interfacial area between COz and the slurry of water and slag was necessary to enhance COz absorption. It was found that the absorption capacity of C 02 into the normal and stainless steel <b>reducing</b> <b>slag</b> using this method on the most optimum grinding condition was 0. 21 and 0. 3 1 kg CO~lkgsl ag respectively. To profoundly investigate the mechanism of COz absorption, study on the absorption behavior of C 02 into EAF normal and stainless steel oxidizing slag with wet grinding method was also conducted. The results showed that the conversion ratio of CaO to CaC 03 was not solely affected by the CaO content in the slag, but by the CaO/A 1203 ratio in the slag. The conversion ratio linearly increased with the increase in the Ca 01 A 1203 ratio. The rate of CO 2 absorption in the slag with wet grinding method was highly depended on the dissolution behavior of ca 2 + ion from the slag into water and the interfacial area between the COz gas and water. The rate increased with the increase in the both factors. The dissolution behavior of 2 +. Ca d. ~ fferedb etween each slags depended on the main phases reaction in the slag. Thus, the main phases in each slags affected the overall reaction of the C 02 absorption. The 2 Ca 0. A 1203. Si 02 was found to hinder the absorption of CO 2 into the slag. While CaO. Si 02 and 2 Ca 0. Si 02 phases in the slag were favorable for the CO 2 absorption. It was found that the absorption quantity of CO 2 into the stainless steel oxidizing slag with low A 1203 content on the most optimum grinding condition was about 0. 26 kg CO&g slag. Comparison between the amount of C 02 absorption in this study and the amount of CO 2 emitted from various power plants, which was estimated by the energy consumption of the vibrating mill, revealed that the former was not always higher than the latter. Reduction amount of 1 % from overall C 02 emission from steel industry can be expected by this method. Use of other possible materials will lead to the increase in the potential reduction amount. The overall cost for the system is expected to be very low and this also indicates that this method is economically feasible. Along with the absorption of C 02, Zn could be removed by using this method with high removal ratio. The dissolutions of Cr were low for all conditions and the pH of the sluny were within the environmental quality standard. It was also found that even though the mortar made from the ground carbonated slag can't be used to concrete, however, it can still be used as normal mortar...|$|E

40|$|To {{handle a}} great demand for biomass, {{alternative}} biomasses beyond stem wood are being {{introduced into the}} solid fuel combustion market, fuels with generally higher (> 0, 5 wt-%) ash content and different fuel ash compositions compared to stem wood, such as forest residue, bark, grass and straw. Unfortunately, combustion of these alternative fuels often causes more ash related problems such as fouling, slagging and higher particle emissions compared to combustion of stem wood. Many research {{studies have been conducted}} regarding ash melting and ash sintering in biomass combustion. However, literature discussing slagging of biomass ash is rather scarce, especially relating to fixed bed combustion. The majority of the biomass fuels available on the market today are phosphorus-poor and this thesis emanates from those. The overall objective was to obtain knowledge of slag formation in fixed-bed combustion of phosphorus-poor biomass, based on bench- and full-scale experiments, chemical analysis of produced ash fractions, chemical equilibrium calculations, viscosity estimations and statistical evaluations.   This thesis investigates slagging of [phosphorus-poor] biomass in fixed bed combustion. 85 fuels and 10 different burner/boiler technologies were utilized. The results in this thesis highlight the importance of the ash forming elements Si, Ca, K and Alin the slag formation process in fixed bed combustion of phosphorus-poor biomass. Increased Ca/Si ratios in the fuel <b>reduce</b> <b>slag</b> formation due to formation of more temperature stable phases, i. e. Ca/Mg-oxides and/or formation of carbonate melts with lower viscosity (not sticky) that are less prone to forming slag. A high Al/Si ratio increases the possibility of forming solid and thermally stable K−Al silicates that can <b>reduce</b> <b>slag</b> formation.   The fraction of ash melt, along with viscosity, are critical for slag formation and these parameters vary between different fuels. Four classes were defined according to their slagging potential; 1) No slag: fuel composition and the bottom ash contains low Si and K contents and higher Ca content. Fuel examples: non-contaminated stem- and pulpwood/energy wood, 2) Minor slagging tendency: fuel compositions show increased Si compared to non-slagging fuels and the bottom ash contains lower Ca, but increased Si content and approximately unchanged K content compared to the former category. Fuel examples: stem wood, bark and logging residue with increased Si-content due to light contamination. 3) Moderate slagging tendency: fuel composition contains further increased Si content. Increased share of formed silicate melt and higher viscosity (more sticky) compared to minor slagging fuels. Fuel examples: mostly contaminated woody fuels and grass and straws with relatively high amount of Ca. and 4) Major slagging tendency: Fuel composition contains high Si and K content. Sticky K-silicates causes major increase in slagging tendency. Fuel examples: different types of grass and straw fuels.   The burner/boiler technology can affect whether slagging will induce major problems in the burner or not. However, long residence times and high temperatures for the combustion residues in the hot part of the fuel bed are technical prerequisite for increased slag formation.   This thesis developed two qualitative fuel indices for predicting slagging in fixed bed combustion of phosphorus-poor biofuels – one index for fraction of fuel ash that forms slag and one index for sintering category of the formed slag. Both novel indices deliver acceptable results and are more reliable than previous indices found in the literature. Importantly, the fraction of fuel ash that forms slag index outperforms the sintering category for qualitative prediction of the problematic slagging potential of a certain fuel. Additional work is needed to further widen the compositional range as well as to fine tune the indices’ boundaries...|$|R

Ideal crop characteristics at harvest are low N and P to reduce future fertiliser inputs, low K and Cl to reduce corrosion in boilers, low moisture to reduce spoilage and transportation costs, and low Si and ash to <b>reduce</b> <b>slagging</b> and consequent operational downtime. Stems and leaves were harvested during: summer, autumn, and the following spring after overwinter ripening. In spring, stem contents of N were 30 to 60 mg kg- 1, P were 203 - 1132 mg kg- 1, K were 290 - 4098 mg kg- 1, Cl were 10 to 23 mg kg- 1, and moisture were 12 - 38 %. Notably, late senescence resulted in increased N, P, K, Cl, moisture and ash contents, and should therefore be avoided for thermochemical conversion. Flowering and senescence led to overall improved combustion quality, where flowered genotypes tended towards lower P, K, Cl, and moisture contents; marginally less, or similar, N, Si and ash contents; and a similar HHV, compared to those that had not flowered. Such genotypes could potentially be harvested in the autumn.

Addition of kaolin and soil into biomass can convert soluble-K into insoluble-K effectively, and thus <b>reduce</b> alkali-induced <b>slagging.</b> Moreover, soil, attributed to low-cost and wide range of sources, can be slagging inhibitor instead of kaolin. In addition, K 2 O-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 ternary diagrams constructed by addition of K 2 O, SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 into biomass underestimate IDT and over-estimate FT, and they should be constructed according to the biomass ash properties, rather than the simulated ash by adding various compounds into biomass...|$|R

The {{results showed that the}} stirring effect in the bath can be improved by changing the shape on the bath surface around the furnace wall with arc-shaped structure which can shorten the mixing time and <b>reduce</b> the liquid <b>slag</b> and steel splashing amount of the lining, and result in reducing metal lose and prolong the life of the lining...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOil palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) are {{currently}} poorly utilized residue from palm oil processing but {{considered to be}} a potential feedstock for power generation. This study focuses on the combination of the hydrothermal (HT) conversion and the water leaching to produce low-potassium biofuel in order to <b>reduce</b> the <b>slagging</b> and fouling potential of the EFB. Combination of HT process at 180 °C and the water leaching not only reduced the ash content of the biomass but also reduced the potassium and chlorine contents, indicating the effectiveness of this combination to produce clean fuel. The total of 92 % reduction of potassium can be obtained, while ash content can be significantly reduced from 4. 9 % to 0. 9 % wt. The potassium balance for HT process at 180 °C followed by the water leaching is also presented in this study. By calculating the metal oxide ratio in the ash, several slagging/fouling indices can be determined. The slagging and fouling tendency of EFB is improved after HT followed by the leaching process, lowering the tendency of biomass to harm the furnace...|$|R
40|$|Limited {{availability}} of sawdust and cutter shavings {{and an increasing}} demand for wood pellets in Sweden are pushing the market towards new, more problematic, raw materials with higher ash content. Examples of such raw materials are bark, logging residues and whole tree assortments. The objectives of the present work were {{to determine the effects}} of kaolin and limestone addition on the slagging tendencies of some problematic woody biomass pellets during combustion in a typical residential pellet burner and also to contribute to the understanding of the role of kaolin and limestone in preventing slagging. This was accomplished by studying the bottom ash and the slag composition after 19 suspension with additive-to-fuel ratio of 1 wt %d. s. to the severely contaminated bark and cleaning assortment ignificantly <b>reduced</b> the <b>slagging</b> tendencies. Significantly higher Ca- and Al-concentrations in the slag were observed for limestone and kaolin addition, respectively. These changes resulted in a more favorable melting behavior (i. e. a igher solid phase to melt ratio). Upprättat; 2005; Bibliografisk uppgift: CD-ROM; 20080101 (ohmmar...|$|R
40|$|This study {{looked at}} the {{influence}} of temperature on chloride binding in ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) -blended cements, {{in the presence of}} external sulphate. The study was carried out at 20 °C and 38 °C, to reflect typical temperate and warm tropical climatic conditions. Two slags, of different compositions were blended with CEM I 52. 5 R at 30 % replacement. 56 day old pastes (w/b 0. 5) were exposed to combined solutions of sodium chloride and sulphate, and the resultant chloride binding was compared against CEM I 42. 5 R. The presence of sulphates <b>reduced</b> chloride binding, <b>slag</b> blends bound more chlorides, while temperature slightly increased chloride binding...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the efficiency of advanced coal-fired power systems, higher working fluid temperatures must be reached. Some system surfaces will have to be protected by covering them with corrosion-resistant refractories. Corrosion is the degradation of the material surfaces or grain boundaries by chemical reactions with melts, liquids, or gases causing loss of material and, consequently, a decrease in the strength of the structure. In order to develop methods of reducing corrosion, the microstructure that is attacked must be identified along with the mechanism and rates of attack. Earlier tests with several commercially available high-temperature castable refractories showed that the fused-alumina aggregate grains within the materials had the highest corrosion resistance of any of the castable materials. However, the cement holding the grains was easily attacked. Therefore, to improve the corrosion resistance and thermomechanical properties of alumina-based refractories, we attempted to change the cement to a more corrosion- and erosion-resistant bonding material through the addition of rare-earth oxides (REO). Phase diagrams were used to identify stable high-melting-temperature materials within the lanthanide-alumina series that could modify the bonding phase of the alumina-based refractory. Two mechanisms of reducing corrosion were investigated. One was the formation of corrosion-resistant layers within the refractory. The other was increased sintering to increase strength and seal continuous pores that would <b>reduce</b> <b>slag</b> penetration. Garnets (Re{sub 3 }Al{sub 5 }O{sub 12 }) and perovskites (ReAl{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }), where Re is the REO, are two of the stable high-melting-temperature materials identified that were believed could be formed in the refractory matrix to help reduce corrosion rates. For the base refractory, Plicast 99 made by Plibrico was chosen. It is a 99 % alumina castable composed of fused alumina aggregate and a cement made primarily from Alphabond 100, produced by Alcoa. The initial work involved designing a test matrix to study the effects of selected REOs on the corrosion resistance of the refractory. Three different processing methods were employed for fabricating the test samples. These included bulk mixing, impregnation, and surface coatings. Two different corrosion test methods were used to test the mixtures. The first was the static cup test that was used to screen the samples for the second corrosion test which used flowing slag. In addition to the corrosion tests, three-point modulus-of-rupture (MOR) tests were performed using the standard American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) C 133 procedure to determine if the addition of an REO improved the strength of the refractory. A strength increase would show that the refractory was more resistant to erosion and also that sintering had occurred, which would imply a reduction in porosity...|$|R
