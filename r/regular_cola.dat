2500|$|Other {{research}} suggests that soft drinks could play a special role in weight gain. One four-week experiment compared a 450 calorie/day supplement of sugar-sweetened soft drinks to a 450 calorie/day supplement of jelly beans. The jelly bean supplement {{did not lead to}} weight gain, but the soft drink supplement did. The likely reason for the difference in weight gain is that people who consumed the jelly beans lowered their caloric intake at subsequent meals, while people who consumed soft drinks did not. Thus, the low levels of satiety provided by sugar-sweetened soft drinks may explain their association with obesity. That is, people who consume calories in sugar-sweetened beverages may fail to adequately reduce their intake of calories from other sources. Indeed, people consume more total calories in meals and on days when they are given sugar-sweetened beverages than when they are given artificially sweetened beverages or water. However, these results are contradicted by a study by Adam Drewnowski published in 2004, in which [...] "32 subjects consumed a 300-calorie snack of fat-free raspberry cookies or <b>regular</b> <b>cola</b> on two occasions each – either two hours ("early") or 20 minutes ("late") before lunch."

2500|$|Coca-Cola's {{market share}} had been losing ground to diet {{soft drinks and}} {{non-cola}} beverages for many years. Consumers who were purchasing <b>regular</b> <b>colas</b> seemed to prefer the sweeter taste of rival Pepsi-Cola, as Coca-Cola learned in conducting blind taste tests. However, the American public's reaction to the change was negative, even hostile, and the new cola was a major failure.

The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the general characteristics and the lipid content of different tissues of rats after chronic ingestion of a fructose rich soft drink. Methods Forty-five Wistar rats were used. The rats were divided into three groups (n = 15) and allowed to consume water (C), light Coca Cola ® (L) or <b>regular</b> Coca <b>Cola</b> ® (R) as the sole source of liquids for eight weeks. Results The R group presented significantly higher daily liquid intake and significantly lower food intake than the C and L groups. Moreover, relative to the C and L groups, the R group showed higher triglyceride concentrations in the serum and liver. However, the L group animals presented lower values of serum triglycerides and cholesterol than controls. Conclusions Based on the results, it can be concluded that daily ingestion of a large amount of fructose- rich soft drink resulted in unfavorable alterations to the lipid profile of the rats. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This in situ/ex vivo study {{assessed}} the erosive {{potential of a}} light cola drink when compared to a regular one. METHODS: During 2 experimental 14 -days crossover phases, eight volunteers wore palatal devices with 2 human enamel blocks. The groups under study were: group light, erosive challenge with light cola drink and group regular, erosive challenge with <b>regular</b> <b>cola</b> drink. During 14 days, erosive challenges were performed extraorally 3 X/day. In each challenge, the device was immersed in 150 ml of light cola (group light) or <b>regular</b> <b>cola</b> (group regular) for 5 min. Erosion was analysed by surface profilometry (microm) and surface microhardness change (%SMH). The data were statistically analyzed using paired t test (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Objective: Even resin {{composites}} and glass-ionomer cements {{are widely}} used for dental cervical region restorations, under erosive condition they can wear out quickly. This study aimed to compare, by means of bond strength by microshear, {{the performance of a}} resin composite (RC) and a resin-modified glass-ionomer cement (RMGIC) to eroded dentin and its association with 2 % chlorhexidine up to 6 months. Material and Methods:. Eighty  sound third molars teeth were cutt to obtain flat coronal dentin, which were subsequently embedded in self-curing acrylic resin circular molds exposing only this surface available. Teeth were divided into two groups, according to the treatment with the Adper Single Bond 2 + RC Filtek Z 250 (Z) or the RMGIC Vitremer (V). Half of the specimens were immersed in artificial saliva-AS for 24 hours (control groups) and half subjected to 3 x/ 1 minute daily immersion in <b>Regular</b> Coca <b>Cola</b> ®-RC for 5 days. Half of the specimens for each described condition were treated with water and half with 2 % chlorhexidine for 1 minute prior the restoration. For all groups, the specimens were stored in artificial saliva weekly renewed up to tests. The bonding strength was evaluated by  microshear test after 1 month and 6 months. Data, in normal distribution, were analyzed with 3 -way ANOVA and Tukey (p < 0. 05). Results: Challenge factors, materials and time were statistically significant [...] Restorations with Z showed significantly higher bond strength compared to V in all situations. There was a reduction in bond strength values over time for all tested conditions. The prior application of 2 % chlorhexidine was able to preserve the Z bond strength between 1 and 6 months, but this factor was not statistically significant.

40|$|Current UK {{intake of}} non-milk {{extrinsic}} sugars (NMES) is above recommendations. Reducing the sugar content of processed high sugar foods through reformulation is one option for reducing consumption of NMES at a population level. However, reformulation {{can alter the}} sensory attributes of food products and influence consumer liking. This study evaluated consumer acceptance of a selection of products that are commercially-available in the UK; these included regular and sugar-reduced baked beans, strawberry jam, milk chocolate, cola and cranberry & raspberry juice. Sweeteners {{were present in the}} reformulated chocolate (maltitol), cola (aspartame and acesulfame-K) and juice (sucralose) samples. Healthy, non-smoking consumers (n = 116; 55 men, 61 women, age: 33 ± 9 years; BMI: 25. 7 ± 4. 6 kg/m 2) rated the products for overall liking and on liking of appearance, flavor and texture using a nine-point hedonic scale. There were significant differences between standard and reduced sugar products in consumers’ overall liking and on liking of each modality (appearance, flavor and texture; all P < 0. 0001). For overall liking, only the <b>regular</b> beans and <b>cola</b> were significantly more liked than their reformulated counterparts (P < 0. 0001). Cluster analysis identified three consumer clusters that were representative of different patterns of consumer liking. For the largest cluster (cluster 3 : 45 %), {{there was a significant difference}} in mean liking scores across all products, except jam. Differences in liking were predominantly driven by sweet taste in 2 out of 3 clusters. The current research has demonstrated that a high proportion of consumers prefer conventional products over sugar-reduced products across a wide range of product types (45 %) or across selected products (27 %), when tasted unbranded, and so there is room for further optimization of commercial reduced sugar products that were evaluated in the current study. Future work should evaluate strategies to facilitate compliance to dietary recommendations on NMES and free sugars, such as the impact of sugar-reduced food exposure on their acceptance...|$|R

Wistar rats drank: water (group W), <b>regular</b> <b>cola</b> beverage (group C, sucrose sweetened) or "light" cola beverage (group L, artificially sweetened). After 6 months, 50 % of the animals in each group were euthanized and the remaining animals consumed water for the next 6 months when euthanasia was performed. Biochemical assays, insulinemia determination, estimation of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), morphometry and immunohistochemistry evaluations were performed in pancreas. Hyperglycemia (16 %, p< 0. 05), CoQ 10 (coenzyme-Q 10) decrease (- 52 %,p< 0. 01), strong hypertriglyceridemia (2. 8 -fold, p< 0. 01), hyperinsulinemia (2. 4 fold, p< 0. 005) and HOMA-IR increase (2. 7 fold, p< 0. 01) were observed in C. Group C showed a decrease in number of α cells (- 42 %, p< 0. 01) and β cells (- 58 %, p< 0. 001) and a moderate increase in α cells' size after wash-out (+ 14 %, p< 0. 001). Group L showed reduction in β cells' size (- 9 %, p< 0. 001) and only after wash-out (L 12) a 19 % increase in size (p< 0. 0001) with 35 % decrease in number of α cells (p< 0. 01). Groups C and L showed increase in α/β-cell ratio which was irreversible only in C (α/β = + 38 % in C 6,+ 30 % in C 12, p< 0. 001 vs. W 6). <b>Regular</b> <b>cola</b> induced a striking increase in the cytoplasmic expression of Trx 1 (Thioredoxin- 1) (2. 25 -fold in C 6 vs. W 6; 2. 7 -fold in C 12 vs. W 12, p< 0. 0001) and Prx 2 (Peroxiredoxin- 2) (3 -fold in C 6 vs. W 6; 2 -fold in C 12 vs. W 12, p< 0. 0001).

Thirty-two volunteers (14 men and 18 women), ages 18 – 35 years, consumed a breakfast preload composed of 590 ml (20 oz) of an energy-containing beverage (1036 kJ) or water (0 kJ) and a slice of toast (418 kJ) on four different occasions. Participants rated hunger, thirst, fullness, and desire to eat at baseline and at 20 -min intervals for 2 h following preload ingestion. A tray lunch was presented at 2 h, 15 min and food consumption was measured. Compared to sparkling water, the three energy-containing beverages were associated with higher fullness and reduced hunger rating and desire to eat. However, energy intakes at lunch (4511 ± 151 kJ for men and 3183 ± 203 kJ for women) were the same across all four beverage conditions and no compensation for breakfast energy was observed. The three beverages of equal energy value were significantly different from sparkling water, but not from each other, in their effects on hunger and satiety ratings.

This in vitro study evaluated the effect of erosive drinks and an enzyme inhibitor (2 % chlorhexidine digluconate – 2 % CHX) on bond strength to dentin. Sixty sound human third molars were selected, and the occlusal enamel was flattened, exposing the dentin surface. The specimens were randomly divided into three groups: AS-Artificial saliva (control group), RC- <b>Regular</b> <b>Cola</b> and ZC- Zero Cola. Twenty specimens were immersed in their respective solution for 1 minute, 3 times a day, {{over the course of}} 5 days. After acid etching and before bonding with Adper Single Bond 2, half of the samples of each group (n = 10) were treated with 2 % CHX, whereas the other half (n = 10) were not, forming the control group (CONV). All the specimens were restored with Filtek Z 250 composite resin filled in Tygon tubes (0. 48 mm 2), yielding six microcylinders for microshear bond strength testing. Three composite resin microcylinders of each specimen were tested after 1 month, and the remaining microcylinders were tested after 6 months. Failure modes were determined using a stereomicroscope (40 x). The data were statistically analyzed by three-way ANOVA and Tukey tests (α = 0. 05).

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} chronic drinking of cola beverages on metabolic and echocardiographic parameters in rats. METHODS: Forty-eight male Wistar rats were divided in 3 groups and allowed to drink <b>regular</b> <b>cola</b> (C), diet cola (L), or tap water (W) ad libitum during 6 mo. After this period, 50 % of the animals in each group were euthanized. The remaining rats drank tap water ad libitum for an additional 6 mo and were then sacrificed. Rat weight, food, and beverage consumption were measured regularly. Biochemical, echocardiographic and systolic blood pressure data were obtained at baseline, and at 6 mo (treatment) and 12 mo (washout). A complete histopathology study was performed after sacrifice. RESULTS: After 6 mo, C rats had increased body weight (+ 7 %, P < 0. 01), increased liquid consumption (+ 69 %, P < 0. 001), and decreased food intake (- 31 %, P < 0. 001). C rats showed mild hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Normoglycemia (+ 69 %, P < 0. 01) and sustained hypertriglyceridemia (+ 69 %, P < 0. 01) were observed in C after washout. Both cola beverages induced an increase in left ventricular diastolic diameter (C: + 9 %, L: + 7 %, P < 0. 05 vs W) and volumes (diastolic C: + 26 %, L: + 22 %, P < 0. 01 vs W; systolic C: + 24 %, L: + 24 %, P < 0. 05 vs W) and reduction of relative posterior wall thickness (C: - 8 %, L: - 10 %, P < 0. 05 vs W).

40|$|Abstract Background Consumption of sugars-sweetened {{beverages}} (SSB) increases energy {{intake and}} the risk of obesity. Large packages increase consumption of food, implying that smaller bottle sizes may help curb SSB consumption, but {{there is a lack of}} relevant evidence relating to these products. This study explores the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a randomised controlled trial to assess the impact of different bottle sizes on SSB consumption at home. Methods Households in Cambridge, England, which purchased at least 2  l of <b>regular</b> <b>cola</b> drinks per week, received a set amount of cola each week for four weeks, in bottles of one of four sizes (1500  ml, 1000  ml, 500  ml, or 250  ml) in random order. The total volume received consisted of a modest excess of households’ typical weekly purchasing, but was further increased for half the study households to avoid ceiling effects. Consumption was measured by recording the number of empty bottles at the end of each week. Eligible households were invited to complete a run-in period to assess levels of active participation. Results Thirty-seven of 111 eligible households with an interest in the study completed the run-in period. The study procedures proved feasible. The target for recruitment (n =  16 households) was exceeded. Measuring consumption was feasible: over three quarters (n =  30 / 37) of households returned all bottles on the majority (n =  88 / 101) of the study weeks completed across households. The validity of this measure was compromised by guests from outside the household who drank the study cola (n =  18 / 37 households on 48 / 101 study weeks) and consumption of the study cola outside the home. Supplying enhanced volumes of cola to nine households was associated with higher consumption (11, 592  ml vs 7869  ml). The intervention and study procedures were considered acceptable. Thirteen households correctly identified the study aims. Conclusion The findings support the feasibility and acceptability of running a randomised controlled trial to assess the impact of presenting a fixed volume of SSB in different bottle sizes on in-home consumption. However, methods that avoid consumption being influenced by the amount of cola supplied weekly by the study and that capture out of home consumption are needed before conducting a randomised controlled trial.
