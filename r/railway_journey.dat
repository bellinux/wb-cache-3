5|$|There {{are many}} leisure spots and conserved areas {{in and around}} Kota Kinabalu. Anjung Samudra (KK Waterfront) is a {{waterfront}} entertainment spot in the city centre which features restaurants, cafes, pubs, and a nightclub. The Royal Sabah Turf Club in Tanjung Aru hosts weekly horse racing events but has since closed and moved to Tambalang Race Course in Tuaran due {{to the expansion of}} Kota Kinabalu International Airport. The North Borneo Railway, which begins its journey from Tanjung Aru station, offers a scenic tour of the countryside in the West Coast Division and the Interior Division. The <b>railway</b> <b>journey</b> ends in the town of Tenom. Sutera Harbour Golf & Country Club near the city centre was built on reclaimed land. It features a golf and country club, a marina, and two hotels.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the middle}} of the 19th century, the courts applied the lex loci {{contract}}us or the law of the place where the contract was made to decide whether the given contract was valid. The apparent advantage of this approach was that the rule was easy to apply with certain and predictable outcomes. Unfortunately, it was also open to abuse, e.g. the place could be selected fraudulently to validate an otherwise invalid contract; it might lead to the application of laws with no real connection with the transaction itself, say, because the parties signed the agreement while on holiday; or it might have been difficult to decide where the contract was made, e.g. because it was negotiated and signed on a <b>railway</b> <b>journey</b> through several states.|$|E
25|$|The first {{full-scale}} working railway {{steam locomotive}} {{was built in}} the United Kingdom in 1804 by Richard Trevithick, a British engineer born in Cornwall. This used high-pressure steam to drive the engine by one power stroke. The transmission system employed a large flywheel to even out the action of the piston rod. On 21 February 1804, the world's first steam-powered <b>railway</b> <b>journey</b> in the world took place when Trevithick's unnamed steam locomotive hauled a train along the tramway of the Penydarren ironworks, near Merthyr Tydfil in South Wales. Trevithick later demonstrated a locomotive operating upon a piece of circular rail track in Bloomsbury, London, the Catch Me Who Can, but never got beyond the experimental stage with railway locomotives, not least because his engines were too heavy for the cast-iron plateway track then in use.|$|E

25|$|Six {{locomotives}} {{worked in}} the quarry. Allenby, Beatty, Haig and Trotter were based at the shed {{at the top of}} the main self-acting incline, while Ian Hamilton and Stringer were based in a shed at a higher level. Three steam navvies were used to load stone into the railway wagons, and there were nineteen or twenty steam cranes, all of which were self-propelled and ran on the tracks either in the quarry or on top of the dam. An official visit by officers of the Corporation on 5 June 1925 used motor transport to reach Scar House, but the party then made the zig-zag <b>railway</b> <b>journey</b> to cross the valley and inspect the steam generating plant, which was on the far side. They ascended the incline to Carle Fell Quarry, sitting in wagons fitted with transverse seats, and having inspected the new workings, descended again, a scene which was officially recorded by a photographer.|$|E
25|$|Burton's {{plan was}} to use {{the largest of the}} sand-dunes on the north-facing shore as the focus of a half-wheel street layout. This was landscaped, and became known as the Mount. It served as the hub of Burton's half-wheel design, the main {{residential}} streets acted as the spokes, and the main commerce area of Dock Street was the rim of the wheel. The oldest surviving building in the town, once the custom house, later the town hall and latterly Fleetwood Museum, dates from 1836 and housing from as early as 1838 still exists in the town. The crown jewel was the North Euston Hotel, built in 1841, a fine semi-circular building overlooking the bay and the river's estuary. The hotel was built to serve overnight guests making the <b>railway</b> <b>journey</b> from Euston, and was close to the point of departure for the steamers to Scotland. This journey was made by Queen Victoria in 1847, but by the mid-1850s the completion of the western railway link between London and Scotland over Shap Fell rendered Fleetwood's role as a transport terminus obsolete.|$|E

500|$|Fleming had {{previously}} travelled to the US on the RMS Queen Elizabeth; the experience [...] provided background {{information for the}} final four chapters of the novel.

In addition to Diamonds Are Forever, he used them in Live and Let Die, From Russia, with Love and The Man with the Golden Gun.|$|E

500|$|The {{inconvenient}} siting {{of stations}} {{and the decline}} in hop-picking in the area all contributed to diminishing returns on the line by the late 1950s. Apart from the 16:25 daily working from Paddock Wood which was well patronised by children, few trains carried {{more than a dozen}} passengers. Passenger journeys were estimated in 1958 at around 170 per day, to which was added around 100 schoolchildren. Even the school traffic was lost once the local authority hired the services of Maidstone & District Motor Company. The line was unpopular with commuters due to the poor connections to and from London. Only the 07:34 service would ensure arrival at [...] before 10:00 with one change at Paddock Wood, the following train at 08.20 would only get the passenger to [...] at 10.15 after two changes. In the evening, the 16:32 departed too early for many commuters while the eleven-coach 18:18 [...] service was overcrowded and divided at Tonbridge where three coaches were detached for Ashford. Hawkhurst-bound passengers had to change at Paddock Wood and cross over to the bay platform for the branch service which arrived in Hawkhurst at 19:58. Locals preferred the direct bus services to Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells over the indirect <b>railway</b> <b>journey,</b> as shown by the fact that no more than 250 return tickets were sold from Hawkhurst in the final years of the line. Only the line's expanding pot plant traffic justified its continuing existence.|$|E

The first series, which used the longer title, was broadcast on BBC Two in 1980. After a 14-year hiatus, a further three series were broadcast between 1994 and 1999, using the shorter series title.
