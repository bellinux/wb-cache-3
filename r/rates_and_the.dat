5|$|Kirchner was reelected in 2011. The Constitution of Argentina allows {{only one}} reelection. Many of her {{supporters}} proposed {{an amendment to}} the Constitution to allow indefinite reelections. Kirchner did not publicly support the proposal, but did not discourage or reject it either. The proposal was not taken to the Congress, as the FPV still lacked the required two-thirds majority to approve an amendment bill. It was rejected by many sectors of society. The first big demonstration (a cacerolazo) took place in September 2012. It was not called by specific politicians or social leaders, but by the public using social networks. The massive turnout was completely unexpected by both the government and the opposition. People also protested the 2012 Buenos Aires rail disaster, the conflict between Kirchnerism and the media, rising crime <b>rates,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tight currency controls. Kirchner dismissed the demonstration, and said that she would continue working as before. Most of the Kirchner loyalists, however, preferred simply to ignore the protest.|$|E

5|$|As the {{inception}} of the United Nations as an intergovernmental entity slowly began formalizing in 1944, delegates from 44 of its early member states met at a hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire for the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, now commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods conference. Delegates remained cognizant {{of the effects of the}} Great Depression, struggles to sustain the international gold standard during the 1930s, and related market instabilities. Whereas previous discourse on the international monetary system focused on fixed versus floating exchange rates, Bretton Woods delegates favored pegged exchange rates for their flexibility. Under this system, nations would peg their exchange rates to the U.S. dollar, which would be convertible to gold at $35 USD per ounce. This arrangement is commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods system. Rather than maintaining fixed rates, nations would peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar and allow their exchange rates to fluctuate within a 1% band of the agreed-upon parity. To meet this requirement, central banks would intervene via sales or purchases of their currencies against the dollar. Members could adjust their pegs in response to long-run fundamental disequillibria in the balance of payments, but were responsible for correcting imbalances via fiscal and monetary policy tools before resorting to repegging strategies. The adjustable pegging enabled greater exchange rate stability for commercial and financial transactions which fostered unprecedented growth in international trade and foreign investment. This feature grew from delegates' experiences in the 1930s when excessively volatile exchange <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reactive protectionist exchange controls that followed proved destructive to trade and prolonged the deflationary effects of the Great Depression. Capital mobility faced de facto limits under the system as governments instituted restrictions on capital flows and aligned their monetary policy to support their pegs.|$|E

In this subsection, we study the effect of combined normalization of only these three acoustic correlates of speech on children's speech recognition performance. The combined normalization of the acoustic correlates of speech has been done in sequential manner, that is, for obtaining both <b>the</b> speaking <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pitch-normalized speech signals; first the speaking rate of the speech signal is normalized followed by its pitch-normalization. As mentioned earlier, VTLN is performed in the feature domain whereas <b>the</b> speaking <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pitch-normalization are done in the signal domain. Thus, to incorporate VTLN in combination with <b>the</b> speaking <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pitch-normalization, the signal is first speaking rate and/or pitch-normalized followed by VTLN. Between <b>the</b> speaking <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pitch-normalization, we have first normalized the speaking rate since the speaking rate transformation may result in slight modification of the pitch of the signals.|$|R
