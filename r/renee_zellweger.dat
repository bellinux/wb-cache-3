40|$|The paper {{analyses}} the 2008 biopic Miss Potter and {{the extent}} to which the film constitutes Potter as an artist, rather than a writer. The paper explores the use of animation to constitute the psychic interiority of Beatrix Potter – she literally is what she paints. Because of its emphasis on the romantically inclined, independent woman; and the meanings brought to star <b>Renee</b> <b>Zellweger’s</b> previous roles in Down With Love and Bridget Jones Diary, and male lead Ewan McGregor who had also starred in Down With Love, the paper also locates the film in the contemporary chic flic and the construction of consumerist forms of postfeminism...|$|R

An editorial focused on the trailer for the film by Variety critic Owen Gleiberman titled [...] "Renee Zellweger: If She No Longer Looks Like Herself, Has She Become a Different Actress?"

500|$|Andrew Davies {{collaborated on}} the screenplays for the 2001 and 2004 Bridget Jones films, in which Crispin Bonham-Carter (Mr. Bingley) and Lucy Robinson (Mrs. Hurst) {{appeared}} in minor roles. The self-referential in-joke between the projects convinced Colin Firth {{to accept the}} role of Mark Darcy, as it gave him an opportunity to ridicule and liberate himself from his Pride and Prejudice character. Film critic James Berardinelli would later state that Firth [...] "plays this part [...] exactly as he played the earlier role, making it evident that the two Darcys are essentially the same". The producers never {{found a way to}} incorporate the Jones-Firth interview in the second film but shot a spoof interview with Firth as himself and <b>Renée</b> <b>Zellweger</b> staying in character as Bridget Jones after a day's wrap. The scene, which extended Bridget's Darcy obsession to cover Firth's lake scene in Love Actually, is available as a bonus feature on the DVD.|$|E

In 2003, Eckhart co-starred with Hilary Swank in The Core, a film about a geophysicist who tries to detonate a nuclear device in order to save the world from destruction. The film was critically and financially unsuccessful. Also in 2003, he appeared in The Missing, in which he played Cate Blanchett's lover, and in the action-thriller Paycheck opposite Ben Affleck. Paycheck, based on a short story by science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, garnered generally negative reception. Film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two stars (out of four), saying that he [...] "enjoyed the movie" [...] but felt that it [...] "exploits [...] for its action and plot potential, but never really develops it." ...|$|E

It's so funny, because when I read it, I didn't get it — I {{thought it was a}} typo somehow. I kept looking at it. It was the one thing in the script that I was looking at going, 'Is that right? Can that be right? How is that right?' I thought, 'Is there a better way to say that? Am I not getting it? I just don't know how to do it.'" [...] Brandt stated in 2014 that [...] "I definitely noticed an uptick of young people becoming interested in the agent business after Jerry Maguire". [...] "Some of what happened to the agent industry would have happened without 'Jerry,' but definitely not as fast as it did," [...] noted Peter Schaffer, who has been a sports agent since 1988.|$|R
