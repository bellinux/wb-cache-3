Michael learned that he had alcohol in his system the night of the car accident, with Dr. Lee hypothesizing that Michael has this dream because he feels guilty for killing his son.|$|E

In her 2007 volume of essays, titled În Ţara Miticilor. De şapte ori Caragiale ("In the Land of the Mitici.

Herbert discusses the most common interpretations of quantum mechanics and their consequences in turn, highlighting the conceptual advantages and drawbacks of each.|$|E

5|$|Weber's {{thinking}} was {{strongly influenced by}} German idealism and particularly by neo-Kantianism, {{to which he had}} been exposed through Heinrich Rickert, his professorial colleague at the University of Freiburg. Especially important to Weber's work is the neo-Kantian belief that <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> essentially chaotic and incomprehensible, with all rational order deriving from {{the way in which the}} human mind focuses its attention on certain aspects of reality and organises the resulting perceptions. Weber's opinions regarding the methodology of the social sciences show parallels with the work of contemporary neo-Kantian philosopher and pioneering sociologist Georg Simmel.|$|E
5|$|Dhumavati is the {{primordial}} darkness and ignorance, from which rises {{the world of}} illusion. She represents the darkness/ignorance before creation and after decay. This ignorance, which obscures the ultimate <b>reality,</b> <b>is</b> necessary because without the realization of this ignorance, true knowledge can not be achieved. Dhumavati also represents yogic sleep (Yoganidra), the pre-creation state of consciousness, {{as well as the}} primal sleep (the Void) in which all creation would dissolve and reach ultimate reality of Brahman. This void is pure consciousness, the cessation of movements of the mind, and silence. Even Dhumavati's ability to spread disease is also considered positive, as disease punishes the wicked and restores cosmic order. Dhumavati is also associated with the heart or middle region of the body.|$|E
5|$|Even so, {{there is}} no {{shortage}} of criticism against Beyonce's particular brand of feminism. Many critics argue that Beyonce is part of the hyper sexualization of women in the pop industry since the 90's, something that occurred largely in sync with the explosion of the porn industry. Beyond this, some feminist critics argue that Beyonce fuels a culture of post-feminism. With songs like Girls (Who Run the World), Beyonce creates a mindset - particularly among teenage girls - that women are already outdoing men in every aspect of life. When the <b>reality</b> <b>is,</b> these critics say, there are still vast gender inequalities that keep them from doing so. The danger of post-feminism is that while they still exist, young people lack the language to label these inequalities as sexism.|$|E

Raiden is encouraged by Solid Snake not to be concerned with what people tell him but to rely on himself to face his problems.|$|E

In the game's final battle, the player and Bolbox fight to determine who will gain entry into Eden and become Gaia's partner. Bolbox is defeated, and the player joins Gaia in Eden and is granted the gift of intelligence.

Upon realizing the dangers the crystals create, the Martians decide to leave Earth alone and observe until it becomes advanced enough for them to interact with.|$|E

5|$|The Dream Lord keeps Amy {{awake in}} the TARDIS reality while the Doctor and Rory fall asleep {{and return to the}} Leadworth reality. The Dream Lord {{questions}} Amy as to whom she would choose between Rory and the Doctor. He states that she must choose between the worlds; one leads to a peaceful married life with Rory while the other leads to adventure and excitement with the Doctor. Amy returns to Leadworth and rejoins Rory in defending her house from the Eknodine whilst the Doctor is trying to rescue people from Leadworth in a motor-caravan. As Amy believes she is going into labour, Rory is sprayed by the Eknodine and turns to dust. Amy decides that she is willing to risk her own life for the chance of seeing Rory again and concludes the Leadworth <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> false. Amy and the Doctor drive the motor-caravan into the house, leading to their assumed deaths.

After the Dream Lord's departure Amy and Rory are surprised by the Doctor when he directs the TARDIS to self-destruct, apparently killing them all.|$|E
5|$|The camera {{work and}} editing work {{together}} to further heighten the frightening qualities of the film. Eleanor is often viewed from above, and in one scene the camera closes in so tightly on her that she is forced backward over a railing. Eleanor's viewpoint is often juxtaposed with eerie views of the house, as if both viewpoints were the same. Many of the editing choices in the film are also used to heighten the audience's discomfort. There {{are a number of}} rapid cuts in the film that throw off the viewer's sense of spatial orientation, and Dutch angles are used to imply that <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> off-kilter. Cutting on action—showing the characters exiting a room to the right, only to show them entering the next room from the left—is often violated, so that the viewer cannot get a clear sense of which rooms and hallways are connected to one another. The audience also lacks temporal clues. There are few shots in which they can see out a window to determine whether it's night or day. When Eleanor is rescued by Dr. Markway on the unstable spiral staircase, some of the windows nearby show strong sunlight streaming in, while others show darkness outside.|$|E
