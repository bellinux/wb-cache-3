5000|$|A tone hole is {{an opening}} in the body of a wind {{instrument}} which, when alternately closed and opened, changes the pitch of the sound produced. Tone holes may serve specific purposes, such as a trill hole or <b>register</b> <b>hole.</b> A tone hole is, [...] "in wind instruments, a hole that may be stopped by the finger, or a key, to change the pitch of the tone produced." ...|$|E

50|$|The Mazzeo {{system was}} invented by Rosario Mazzeo in the 1950s. Its main feature is a linkage {{operated}} by {{any one of the}} right-hand ring-key fingers which opens the third right-index-finger trill key for playing the throat B flat, instead of using the register key, thereby avoiding the tonal compromise that comes from using the tiny <b>register</b> key <b>hole</b> for venting B flat.|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} lockout assembly for locking {{a circuit}} breaker in a selected off or on position is provided. The lockout assembly includes a lock block and a lock pin. The lock block has a hollow interior which fits over the free end of a switch handle of the circuit breaker. The lock block includes at least one hole that is placed in registration {{with a hole in}} the free end of the switch handle. A lock tab on the lock block serves to align and <b>register</b> the respective <b>holes</b> on the lock block and switch handle. A lock pin is inserted through the <b>registered</b> <b>holes</b> and serves to connect the lock block to the switch handle. Once the lock block and the switch handle are connected, the position of the switch handle is prevented from being changed by the lock tab bumping up against a stationary housing portion of the circuit breaker. When the lock pin is installed, an apertured-end portion of the lock pin is in registration with another hole on the lock block. Then a special scissors conforming to O. S. H. A. regulations can be installed, with one or more padlocks, on the lockout assembly to prevent removal of the lock pin from the lockout assembly, thereby preventing removal of the lockout assembly from the circuit breaker...|$|R
40|$|Generally, {{time-delay}} {{systems are}} regarded as multi-attractor systems. We investigate mode selection rules for two-delay systems considering which oscillation mode is first excited by the Hopf bifurcation with increasing a bifurcation parameter. In particular, {{we focus on the}} case that the strength of the short time delay α 1 is lower than that of the long time delay α 2. In a certain range of α 1 /α 2 in which it is sufficiently small but still not negligible, the third-harmonic mode occupies a particular range of the ratio of the two delay times such that 2 < tR 2 /tR 1 < 4, where tR 1 and tR 2 denote the short and long delay times, respectively. This is the key for understanding the function of the <b>register</b> <b>hole</b> on the clarinet, which is smaller in radius than the other tone holes, but works well to raise the pitch of first register notes in a wide range more than an octave by a twelfth (19 semitones), i. e., generating third harmonics, when opened. This is confirmed using a simple model of the clarinet with two delays: short and long time delays {{are regarded as}} delayed reflections caused by the <b>register</b> <b>hole</b> and the open end of the pipe, respectively. The working range of the <b>register</b> <b>hole</b> roughly corresponds to the particular range of the third-harmonic mode for two-delay systems (2 < tR 2 /tR 1 < 4) ...|$|E
40|$|Even if the tuning {{between the}} first and second {{register}} of a clarinet has been noticeably improved by instrument makers, the inharmonicity of the lowest twelfths (which are too large) is still an unsolved problem. In this paper, we attempt to understand the physical reasons for this problem and to explore whether or not it is possible to improve the accuracy of these twelfths. The starting point is a study of the inharmonicity associated with different bore perturbations inserted in cylindrical instruments, including bore flare, open and closed holes, etc. This study shows that the wide twelfths in question result mostly from the effects of the <b>register</b> <b>hole.</b> Using an elementary model of the clarinet as well as optimization techniques, an optimum location for the <b>register</b> <b>hole</b> is computed (we do not take into account the use of the <b>register</b> <b>hole</b> as a B flat tone hole); the result turns out to be close to the location chosen by the makers. Then small perturbations on the higher part of the cylindrical resonator are introduced and optimized in order to find out whether a simple solution exists for the improvement of the harmonic relationship {{between the first}} and quasi-third resonance frequencies. The result is negative, which probably explains why this fundamental problem of the clarinet has not yet been solved. As a consequence, one has to resort to more complicated local solutions, for instance with individual corrections for each tone hole...|$|E
40|$|The tone hole {{geometry}} of a clarinet is optimized numerically. The instrument is modeled as {{a network of}} one dimensional transmission line elements. For each (non-fork) fingering, we first calculate the resonance frequencies of the input impedance peaks, and compare them with the frequencies of a mathematically even chromatic scale (equal temperament). A least square algorithm is then used to minimize the differences and to derive the {{geometry of}} the instrument. Various situations are studied, with and without dedicated <b>register</b> <b>hole</b> and/or enlargement of the bore. With a dedicated <b>register</b> <b>hole,</b> the differences can remain less than 10 musical cents throughout the whole usual range of a clarinet. The positions, diameters and lengths of the chimneys vary regularly over the whole length of the instrument, in contrast with usual clarinets. Nevertheless, we recover one usual feature of instruments, namely that gradually larger tone holes occur when {{the distance to the}} reed increases. A fully chromatic prototype instrument has been built to check these calculations, and tested experimentally with an artificial blowing machine, providing good agreement with the numerical predictions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{model for}} woodwinds with tone and <b>register</b> <b>holes</b> is presented. It is {{inspired}} by the original idea of A. H. Be-nade considering the set of toneholes as a sequence of 'T-shaped' sections. This idea can be deepened thanks to more recent works on mathematical modelling and analysis of repetitive structures such as networks of strings, beams, membranes, pipes or canals. An essential feature of the model is that it keeps at the one dimensional level. The purpose of this work is to built upon the idea of Benade, inside a precise mathematical framework using concepts and methods from graph theory, for modelling the bore of woodwinds together with its holes {{in order to address}} questions like length corrections due to the lattice of (closed or open) toneholes or toneholes interactions. The long term objective is to use this type of model for simulation, characterization of the natural frequencies of woodwinds and, in a control theoretical setting, for musical acoustics questions such as design as well as for theoretical purposes. Applications of the approach are exposed as a program for future research...|$|R

40|$|An {{improved}} lockout assembly {{is provided}} for {{a circuit breaker}} to lock the switch handle into a selected switch position. The lockout assembly includes two main elements, each having a respective foot for engaging {{a portion of the}} upper housing wall of the circuit breaker. The first foot is inserted into a groove in the upper housing wall, and the second foot is inserted into an adjacent aperture (e. g., a slot) in the upper housing wall. The first foot is slid under and into engagement with a first portion, and the second foot is slid under and into engagement with a second portion of the upper housing wall. At the same time the respective two feet are placed in engagement with the respective portions of the upper housing wall, two holes, one on each of the respective two main elements of the assembly, are placed in registration; and a locking device, such as a special scissors equipped with a padlock, is installed through the <b>registered</b> <b>holes</b> to secure the lockout assembly on the circuit breaker. When the lockout assembly of the invention is secured on the circuit breaker, the switch handle of the circuit breaker is locked into the selected switch position and prevented from being switched to another switch position...|$|R

This efficient implementation produces results which agree well with previous acoustical analyses of the tonehole. A similar model is also presented for the <b>register</b> <b>hole.</b> A complete woodwind instrument model with many toneholes and register hole(s) is implemented in a cross-platform, C++ real-time computer programming environment. A new wind controller created to control the woodwind model is also briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} {{of the first and}} second resonance frequencies on tuning, timbre (or tone colour) and ease of playing is investigated for reed instruments, such as the clarinet, alto saxophone and oboe. Theoretical analyses of the eflects of the reed and the player embouchure (i. e. lip position and pressure on the reed) are reviewed, as well as the consequences of inharmonicity in the resonance frequencies. This review allows us to present interesting interpretations of the numerous experiments reported here. Three kinds of results are given: (I) comparison of playing frequencies andfirst resonance frequencies, for severalfmgerings with or without open <b>register</b> <b>hole,</b> leading to the deJinition of a frequency independent length correction for the embouchure; (2) examination of the eflect of inharmonicity of the two jirst resonance frequencies on both tone colour and ease of playing, the causes coming from either the player embouchure or the instrument construction; (3) comparison between theory and experiment for the inharmonicity produced by the changes in conicity in oboes, leading to an interpretation of the maker's choices. The results show how judicious use of simple tools, such as calculations or measurements of input impedance or playing data obtained using an arttjicial mouth, can be of help to the understanding of instrument construction and to the instrument designer...|$|E
40|$|Even if the tuning {{between the}} first and second {{register}} of a clarinet has been optimized by instrument makers, the lowest twelfths remain slightly too large (inharmonicity). In this article, we study the problem from two different points of view. First, we systematically review various physical reasons why this inharmonicity may take place, and the effect of different bore perturbations inserted in cylindrical instruments. Applications to a real clarinet resonator and comparisons with impedance measurements are then presented. A commonly accepted idea is that the <b>register</b> <b>hole</b> is the dominant cause for this inharmonicity: it is natural to expect that opening this hole will raise the resonance frequencies of the instrument, except for the note for which the hole is at the pressure node. We show that the real situation is actually more complicated because other effects, such as open holes or bore taper and bell, introduce resonance shifts that are comparable but with opposite sign, so that a relatively good overall compensation takes place. The origin of the observed inharmonicity in playing frequencies is therefore different. In a second part, we use an elementary model of the clarinet in order to isolate the effect of the register hole: a perfect cylindrical tube without closed holes. Optimization techniques are then used to calculate an optimum location for the register hole; the result turns out to be close to the location chosen by clarinet makers. Finally, attempts are made numerically to improve the situation by introducing small perturbations in the higher part of the cylindrical resonator, but no satisfactory improvement is obtained.

50|$|Thicker hatchings {{were less}} {{expensive}} and easier to produce, but the result was not as attractive. Books that were to be produced as inexpensively as possible showed less engraving work and colour separation. The chief problem was to maintain correct register so that the design on the block matched the design on the paper. To achieve a precise <b>register</b> small <b>holes</b> were drilled along each block, and the paper was pinned to it. When done correctly, the block's colour registers matched printed paper, although sometimes ink squash is visible {{along the edges of}} an illustration. An electroplate was produced for each engraved wood block, inked according to the block, thereby tinting the paper in specified areas. The colour was applied as a solid, or in stripes of various of thickness, allowing for changes in hue.|$|R

5000|$|A {{standard}} {{scenario in}} many computer applications {{is a collection}} of points (measurements, dark pixels in a bit map, etc.) in which one wishes to find a topological feature. Homology can serve as a qualitative tool to search for such a feature, since it is readily computable from combinatorial data such as a simplicial complex. However, the data points have to first be triangulated, meaning one replaces the data with a simplicial complex approximation. Computation of persistent homology involves analysis of homology at different resolutions, <b>registering</b> homology classes (<b>holes)</b> that persist as the resolution is changed. Such features can be used to detect structures of molecules, tumors in X-rays, and cluster structures in complex data.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I attempt {{to further the}} {{emerging}} Lacanian-inspired study of management and organization by introducing his notion of the sinthome. The sinthome must {{be understood as a}} necessary support of subjectivity rather than a pathological formation. In the Lacanian conceptualization of subjectivity, it enables the registers of the Symbolic, the Imaginary and the Real to be knotted together in a specific way,and thereby regulates the distribution of jouissance that takes shape within their ?knot?. Therefore, the sinthome {{can be thought of as}} the specific constellation of the registers in a socio-historical context, by organizing jouissance and giving a superficial sheen of consistency to the subject. It reproduces itself in the registers and ensures the superficial coherence of an ideological discourse. I argue that the three functions by which the sinthome reproduces itself in the <b>registers,</b> namely consistency, <b>hole</b> and exsistence,provide a fruitful and novel theorization of how subjectivity, discourse and jouissance are entangled in organizational contexts...|$|R
