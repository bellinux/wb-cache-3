25|$|Rubber {{particles}} are {{formed in the}} cytoplasm of specialized latex-producing cells called laticifers within rubber plants. Rubber {{particles are}} surrounded by a single phospholipid membrane with hydrophobic tails pointed inward. The membrane allows biosynthetic proteins to be sequestered at {{the surface of the}} growing <b>rubber</b> <b>particle,</b> which allows new monomeric units to be added from outside the biomembrane, but within the lacticifer. The <b>rubber</b> <b>particle</b> is an enzymatically active entity that contains three layers of material, the <b>rubber</b> <b>particle,</b> a biomembrane and free monomeric units. The biomembrane is held tightly to the rubber core due to the high negative charge along the double bonds of the rubber polymer backbone. Free monomeric units and conjugated proteins make up the outer layer. The rubber precursor is isopentenyl pyrophosphate (an allylic compound), which elongates by Mg2+-dependent condensation by the action of rubber transferase. The monomer adds to the pyrophosphate end of the growing polymer. The process displaces the terminal high-energy pyrophosphate. The reaction produces a cis polymer. The initiation step is catalyzed by prenyltransferase, which converts three monomers of isopentenyl pyrophosphate into farnesyl pyrophosphate. The farnesyl pyrophosphate can bind to rubber transferase to elongate a new rubber polymer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: At medium loading rates, void {{formation}} usually precedes plasticity in {{the matrix}} around the particles in rubber toughened polymers. Many authors have proposed {{models for the}} relationship between rubber surface energy, volume strain energy and void growth. In this paper, it is shown that another volume criterion must also be satisfied, arising from the fact that in all these models, no decohesion is allowed at the particle-matrix interface. A fracture mechanics approach, where linear and non linear elasticity are assumed for the matrix and the <b>rubber</b> <b>particle</b> respectively, is used to define a void formation criterion depending on the rubber fracture surface energy. After formation, the stability of the void is examined, taking into account the volume conservation between matrix and particle and the stress due to surface tension when the void size is very small. A size effect is observed, indicating that voids cannot grow in small particles. The required value of fracture energy in a particle on a microscopic scale is discussed.

High impact polystyrene (HIPS) is a heterogeneous polymer alloy produced by dissolving rubber in styrene and polymerizing the solution. The final product consists of rubber particles dispersed within a polystyrene matrix. For a HIPS resin, mechanical properties depend on the <b>rubber</b> <b>particle</b> morphology, <b>rubber</b> <b>particle</b> size, and adhesion to the polystyrene matrix. Previous studies have shown that these rubber phase properties are related to feed formulations, polymerization conditions, and process type. The current research provides data on the effect of polymerization conditions on rubber phase properties. Specifically, the effect of polymerization temperature, initiator concentration, chain transfer agent concentration, and polybutadiene rubber molecular weight on <b>rubber</b> <b>particle</b> size and morphology were examined in a 1250 ml laboratory continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). Also, the effect of continuing polymerization and devolatilization, varying agitation, and using a preinversion CSTR on <b>rubber</b> <b>particle</b> size and morphology were examined in a 1 00 lb/hr pilot plant. <b>Rubber</b> <b>particle</b> size was shown to depend on the viscosity ratio of the polystyrene and rubber phases, interfacial tensions and shear rate. <b>Rubber</b> <b>particle</b> size is increased by: (1) increasing the viscosity ratio by increasing styrene molecular weight, and increasing CSTR conversion, decreasing poly rubber molecular weight, (2) increasing HIPS polymerization solution viscosity, (3) decreasing interfacial tension through grafting, and (4) increasing shear rate through agitator speed.

In general, the disadvantage of adding <b>rubber</b> <b>particles</b> into polymeric resin is the dramatic reduction of stiffness although the toughness could be modified accordingly.

40|$|Two protein {{families}} {{required for}} rubber biosynthesis in Taraxacum brevicorniculatum {{have recently been}} characterized, namely the cis-prenyltransferases (TbCPTs) and the small <b>rubber</b> <b>particle</b> proteins (TbSRPPs). The latter were shown {{to be the most}} abundant proteins on rubber particles, where rubber biosynthesis takes place. Here we identified a protein designated T. brevicorniculatum rubber elongation factor (TbREF) by using mass spectrometry to analyze <b>rubber</b> <b>particle</b> proteins. TbREF is homologous to the TbSRPPs but has a molecular mass that is atypical for the family. The promoter was shown to be active in laticifers, and the protein itself was localized on the <b>rubber</b> <b>particle</b> surface. In TbREF-silenced plants generated by RNA interference, the rubber content was significantly reduced, correlating with lower TbCPT protein levels and less TbCPT activity in the latex. However, the molecular mass of the rubber was not affected by TbREF silencing. The colloidal s tability of rubber particles isolated from TbREF-silenced plants was also unchanged. This was not surprising because TbREF depletion did not affect the abundance of TbSRPPs, which are required for <b>rubber</b> <b>particle</b> stability.

It is shown that cavitation and yield are essentially coupled processes. On the macroscopic scale, both are softening mechanisms: If macroscopic yield takes place before the limit stress for cavitation is reached, cavitation is prohibited. Furthermore, and contrary to common belief, it is found from the interfacial stress history that, using realistic material parameters, the <b>rubber</b> <b>particle</b> continues to significantly affect plasticity in the matrix in the post-cavitation regime, i. e. after it has cavitated, so that cavitated particles cannot always be considered to be equivalent to particle-sized voids. ...|$|E

Crosslink density is not the only factor that contributes to high strength property of natural rubber latex films. The addition of higher levels of crosslinking agent resulting in higher crosslink density and modulus of elasticity values, but, too high crosslinking may lead to subsequent decreased in the tensile strength value.

A 14 kilodalton protein, rubber {{elongation}} factor (REF), is associated with the <b>rubber</b> <b>particle</b> in a ratio of one REF to one rubber molecule (Dennis M, Henzel W, Bell J, Kohr W, Light D [1989] J Biol Chem 264 : 18618 - 18628; Dennis M, Light D [1989] J Biol Chem 264 : 18608 - 18617). To obtain more information concerning the function of REF and its synthesis and assembly in the <b>rubber</b> <b>particle,</b> we isolated cDNA clones encoding REF. We used antibodies to REF to screen a Hevea leaf γgt 11 cDNA expression library and obtained several positive clones. Sequence analysis of the REF cDNA clones showed that the REF mRNA contains 121 nucleotides of 5 ′-nontranslated sequences and a 205 nucleotide 3 ′-nontranslated region. The open reading frame encodes the entire 14 kilodalton REF protein without any extra amino acids (Dennis M, Henzel W, Bell J, Kohr W, Light D [1989] J Biol Chem 264 : 18618 - 18628). The REF cDNA was subcloned in pGEM- 3 Z/- 4 Z and expressed in vitro. The translation product is a 14 kilodalton protein that can be immunoprecipitated with antibodies to REF. Addition of microsomal membranes to the in vitro translation product did not alter the mobility of the REF protein. This, and the sequence data, indicate that REF is not made as a preprotein. Our results suggest that REF is synthesized on free polysomes in the laticifer cytoplasm and that assembly of the rubber particles is likely to occur in the cytosol...|$|E

40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} and deformation behaviour of two high- impact polystyrenes, named 0. 45 S and 0. 84 S that have salami-structured <b>rubber</b> <b>particles</b> of 0. 45 m and 0. 84 m in diameter, respectively, were studied {{as a function}} of strain rate ranging from 2. 8 10 - 3 s- 1 to 1. 8 10 s- 1. Comparison of fracture energies obtained from force-displacement curves suggested that values for 0. 84 S were slightly higher than those for 0. 45 S under strain rates up to 1. 6 10 - 1 s- 1. However, the difference was significantly increased at the highest strain rate, mainly because the values for 0. 84 S remarkably increased while those for 0. 45 S decreased. Transmission electron microscopic observation showed that at the highest strain rate, crazes were generated only from a few <b>rubber</b> <b>particles</b> in 0. 45 S while many crazes were generated from <b>rubber</b> <b>particles</b> in 0. 84 S. It is concluded that the fracture energy difference at the highest strain rate was caused by the difference in the number of crazes generated from each of the <b>rubber</b> <b>particles...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{macroscopic}} behaviour of rubber-modified polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) was investigated by {{taking into account}} the microdeformation mechanisms of rubber cavitation. The dependence of the macroscopic stress-strain behaviour of matrix deformation on the cavitation of <b>rubber</b> <b>particles</b> was discussed. A phenomenological elastic-viscoplastic model was used to model the behaviour of the matrix material, while the <b>rubber</b> <b>particles</b> were modelled with the hyperelasticity theory. A two-phase composite material with a periodic arrangement of reinforcing particles of a circular unit cell section was considered. Finite-element analysis was used to determine the local stresses and strains in the two-phase composite. In order to describe the cavitation of the <b>rubber</b> <b>particles,</b> a criterion of void nucleation is implemented in the finite-element (FE) code. A comparison of the numerically predicted response with experimental result indicates that the numerical homogenisation analysis gives satisfactory prediction results...|$|R
