5|$|The game's plot {{focuses on}} Max Caulfield, an 18-year-old {{photography}} student who discovers {{that she has}} the ability to <b>rewind</b> <b>time</b> at any moment, leading her every choice to enact the butterfly effect. After having foreseen an approaching storm, Max must take on the responsibility to prevent it from destroying her town. The player's actions will adjust the narrative as it unfolds, and reshape it once allowed to travel back in time. Fetch quests and making environmental changes represent the forms of puzzle solving in addition to using branching choices for conversation.|$|E
5|$|After the Kid {{returns and}} recovers, Rucks gives him another choice: He {{can have the}} Bastion <b>rewind</b> <b>time</b> to before the Calamity {{in the hopes of}} {{preventing}} it, or use it to evacuate the survivors and move on to somewhere safe. Rucks is unsure if there is any way to prevent the Calamity from reoccurring if the time is rewound, as {{there was no way to}} test the process. The game ends either way, showing images of the characters (with the inclusion of Zulf if the player chose to rescue him) flying away or of their lives before the Calamity along with the credits. In the New Game+ mode, which is unlocked after beating the game once, it is hinted that restoring the world didn't prevent the Calamity.|$|E
5|$|The game follows {{an unnamed}} Prince whose father sacks a Maharaja's {{city at the}} {{instigation}} of its treacherous Vizier. During the attack, the Prince obtains an artifact called the Dagger of Time, while his army captures an hourglass containing the Sands of Time. Visiting Azad to present the Sands {{as a gift to}} the city's ruler, the Vizier tricks the Prince into releasing the Sands, transforming the city's population into savage monsters. Together with the Maharaja's daughter Farah, the Prince works to correct his mistake and return the Sands to the hourglass. The gameplay revolves around the Prince's platforming abilities, broken up by fights with the creatures created by the Sands. A key mechanic in the game is using the Dagger to <b>rewind</b> <b>time</b> if the Prince makes a mistake platforming, and using it to kill and freeze enemies.|$|E
50|$|Ultra Rewind (Urutora Riwaindo): <b>Rewinds</b> <b>time.</b> Not used in movies.|$|R
500|$|The final {{world is}} labeled simply [...] "1." [...] In this world, time flows in reverse. <b>Rewinding</b> <b>time</b> returns {{the flow of}} time to its normal state.|$|R
50|$|Aside from moving, {{the only}} actions Rose can perform are {{covering}} her eyes (to create blind spots for her future selves to pass through) and <b>rewinding</b> <b>time</b> {{to an earlier}} point to correct mistakes.|$|R
5|$|The Sands the Prince {{collects}} from {{enemies and}} the environment are tied to his magical abilities, themselves connected with the Dagger. The most basic power is Rewind, the ability for the Prince to <b>rewind</b> <b>time</b> by up to ten seconds if he makes a mistake in platforming or dies. In combat, the Prince can also slow time immediately around him, freeze time for a single enemy, and freeze time completely so the Prince can attack his enemies at great speed while {{they are unable to}} move. Each use of power uses up one Sand Tank, and when empty, all powers become inaccessible until more Sand is collected. More powerful abilities, such as freezing time, are powered by Power Tanks. Increasing their number unlocks new Sand-based powers. Starting out {{with a small amount of}} Sand available to him, its capacity can be increased by collecting Sand from enemies, along with Sand Clouds scattered around the palace. Large columns of Sand within the Palace grant visions of future areas and act as save points.|$|E
500|$|... 2. Time and Forgiveness plays as an {{ordinary}} platform game, {{except that the}} player may <b>rewind</b> <b>time</b> to undo their actions. The section includes several challenges that would be unplayable or unfair in {{an ordinary}} platform game, but become feasible when the rewind mechanic is available.|$|E
500|$|Life Is Strange {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} town of Arcadia Bay, Oregon, and is told from the {{perspective}} of Maxine [...] "Max" [...] Caulfield (Hannah Telle), a twelfth grade student attending Blackwell Academy during October 2013. During photography class with her teacher Mark Jefferson (Derek Phillips), Max experiences a vision of a lighthouse being destroyed by a swelling tornado. Leaving for the restroom to regain her composure, she witnesses classmate Nathan Prescott (Nik Shriner) accidentally kill a woman in a fit of rage. In a single, sudden effort, she develops the ability to <b>rewind</b> <b>time</b> and rescues the girl; revealed to be her childhood friend Chloe Price (Ashly Burch). The two reunite and go for a walk at the lighthouse, where Max reveals to Chloe her capacity to travel back in time. It is established that the vision is rather the reckoning of a future event: a storm approaching the town. The next day, Max observes fellow student Kate Marsh (Dayeanne Hutton) being bullied for a viral video depicting her kissing several students at a party. It is implied that she was drugged, and Max suspects Nathan as the perpetrator.|$|E
50|$|Fitz and Shaw {{go looking}} for the others, but as they do, a Defaulter bombing causes safety doors to lower. Shaw takes Fitz down to the lower levels, leaving The Doctor and Anji trapped with Bragg. The Doctor {{opens the door and}} seals it again, but Bragg <b>rewinds</b> <b>time</b> to get through.|$|R
5|$|Life Is Strange is {{a graphic}} {{adventure}} played from a third-person view. The mechanic of <b>rewinding</b> <b>time</b> allows the player to redo any action {{that has been}} taken. The player can examine and interact with objects, which enables puzzle solving {{in the form of}} fetch quests and making changes to the environment. Items that are collected before time travelling will be kept in the inventory after the fact.|$|R
5000|$|Full Auto is a {{video game}} for the Xbox 360 console {{published}} by Sega. Originally Developed by Pseudo Interactive for the PC, it is a vehicular combat racing game. It features destructible environments and (in certain races) a mode called [...] "Unwreck" [...] which <b>rewinds</b> <b>time</b> if the player makes a mistake and wants to try again. The game was removed from Games on Demand in August 2012.|$|R
500|$|Development of Life Is Strange {{began in}} April 2013 {{with a team}} of 15, and more people were added when the {{collaboration}} with Square Enix began. [...] Dontnod told Square Enix about Life Is Strange only after Square Enix turned down a pitch for a larger game. Before signing with Square Enix, Life Is Strange was imagined as a full-length video game that Dontnod would self-publish. However, the publisher surmised that it would be more successful as an episodic title. The game was originally codenamed What If but then retitled to distinguish itself from the film of the same name. Life Is Strange was born of the idea for the rewind mechanic, which the developer had already experimented on with their last game Remember Me. The lead character Max was created with the ability to <b>rewind</b> <b>time</b> to supplement this mechanism. The episodic format was decided upon by the studio for creative reasons, financial restrictions and marketing purposes, allowing them to tell the story in its preferred slow pace. The Pacific Northwest was picked as the setting for the purpose of conveying a nostalgic and autumnal feel to the game. The development team visited the region, took photographs, looked at local newspapers and used Google Street View to make sure the environment was accurately portrayed.|$|E
500|$|Braid {{has been}} {{considered}} a masterpiece, and was highly praised for the unique puzzles it presented. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer noted the creative variation on time manipulation {{and the need to}} understand the non-linearity of his actions made him feel as if [...] "years of gaming blinders have been ripped away." [...] Jason Hill of The Age stated the puzzles were [...] "elaborate and formidable", but [...] "impeccably designed and hugely satisfying to solve", a point reiterated by Sunday Herald Suns Paddy Reiley. The connection between the puzzles and the overall presentation of the game was favorably received; Tom McShea of GameSpot stated that Braid was [...] "the rare game that will make you rack your brain trying to solve puzzles one minute while challenging you {{to come to terms with}} its mature tale the next". Sam Roberts, game director for the Slamdance Film Festival Guerrilla Gamemaking Competition, was impressed that Braid did not [...] "feel immature" [...] as it [...] "expects [...] much" [...] of the player as any other form of media and [...] "doesn't short you in any respect". Braids artwork and presentation were given high regards. Nick Suttner of 1UP.com commented that Braids artwork [...] "juxtapose old-school design sensibilities with impressionist backdrops and lovingly hand-painted environments", while McShea stated that the game's visuals were [...] "eye-catching but never distracting". Wireds Jean Snow wrote that Braids [...] "beautiful symphonic melodies contribute to what is already an impressive and unique vision", and that [...] "the soothing tunes are probably the reason you never really lose it when facing particularly tough puzzles". Arthouse Games' Jason Rohrer interpreted the ability to <b>rewind</b> <b>time</b> indefinitely as a commentary about traditional platform game design: the fact the player is not forced to restart the level when they die gives greater emphasis to the game's [...] "core challenges".|$|E
500|$|The game's {{title was}} thought {{up by the}} {{production}} team, but the original story built around the title proved impossible to work. The original draft had nine characters (including the Prince, two love interests, two villains, and two helper characters) representing different political factions, and {{the setting of the}} Prince's own palace home instead of in another kingdom. This storyline ultimately impeded other aspects of development, and so was scrapped. In starting over, the team returned to [...] "The Sands of Time" [...] title and concept. They decided upon four key elements for the game: [...] "Unity of time and place", with the game taking place over twenty-four hours within the palace of Azad; [...] "Acrobatics", referring to the gameplay and how the setting was constructed around this concept; [...] "Combat", with the palace being filled with monsters to give the game and story a fast-paced feeling; and [...] "Rewind", the ability to turn back and manipulate time. One of the early decisions made by the production team was not to refer to Prince of Persia 3D in any degree in designing the gameplay, instead looking to the 1989 original for reference. They intended to capture the original feeling of platforming an adventure in a 3D environment. The Rewind mechanic began as a gameplay wish for the title, surviving the initial rewrite of the story and becoming key to both story and gameplay. The Dagger of Time and the Sands were both born from the need to explain this mechanic in-game. The initial concept was simply using the Dagger to <b>rewind</b> <b>time</b> and dispatch enemies, but its powers were gradually expanded into its current roster. The main character's acrobatics were designed to be novel to the video game medium, inspired by similar stunts performed in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Matrix. A video game which provided inspiration for the acrobatic feats of the Prince was Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. Elements such as using ladders as part of combat, and riding on a magic carpet or a horse were axed early in development. The Rewind function was suggested by the game's director Patrice Désilets based on experiences playing , where he had wished to rewind after making a mistake rather than restarting the entire level.|$|E
500|$|... 5. Time and Decision {{involves}} a [...] "shadow" [...] {{of the player}} character appearing after the player <b>rewinds</b> <b>time</b> and performing the actions that the real player character rewound; if the timeline expires, the shadow will complete any initiated falls and jumps but will otherwise stand still before disappearing. Things coloured in violet can interact both with the main character and his shadow at the same time. Puzzles in this section revolve around using this mechanic to carry out multiple actions at once.|$|R
500|$|While Superman is busy saving others, Lois's car ends up {{falling into}} a crevice that opens {{from one of the}} aftershocks. It fills with dirt and debris and she suffocates to death. Angered at being unable to save her, Superman defies Jor-El's earlier warning not to {{manipulate}} human history, preferring to heed Jonathan's advice that he must be here for [...] "a reason". He accelerates around Earth, <b>rewinding</b> <b>time,</b> to save Lois. After bringing Luthor and Otis to prison, he flies into the sunrise for further adventures.|$|R
50|$|Developed by {{the team}} behind BBC Three's {{innovative}} sketch show The Wrong Door, Rufus must thwart Dr Muhahaha and find his way home. At {{the end of each}} adventure Dr. Muhahaha <b>rewinds</b> <b>time</b> and Rufus crashes back into his own universe, finding himself back in his flat about to start the same fateful day again. Just before he enters the Television Centre {{at the beginning of each}} episode, Rufus always says 'You never know, maybe one day I'll wake up and it might be tomorrow'.|$|R
2500|$|In 2006, Salah won {{the first}} season of Incroyable Talent. In 2007, he {{performed}} a one-man stage show at London-based Breakin' Convention called [...] "The Dream of Gluby". In 2008, he starred as himself in Beats Per Minute, an independent film about a French popper who discovers he can <b>rewind</b> <b>time</b> with his dance moves. In 2009, Salah served as a judge at BOTY's international one-on-one b-boy battle in Germany. BOTY is a b-boy competition exclusively for b-boy crews; however, to celebrate their 20th anniversary they had a competition for b-boy solo dancers.|$|E
2500|$|... (2007-2011), a {{canonical}} {{comic book}} {{continuation of the}} television series, reveals that Wesley was unable to move on after his death due to the standard perpetuity clause in his Wolfram & Hart contract. Now incorporeal, Wesley acts as the last remaining link to Senior Partners, who have sent Angel and all of Los Angeles to hell as punishment for their attack in season five. Following {{the destruction of the}} Wolfram & Hart building {{at the hands of a}} now vampiric Gunn, Wesley's ghost fades away. He convinces the White Room to send him back to Hell, where his sudden appearance causes Illyria to change back and forth between Illyria and Fred's personae. When Angel is confronted by Gunn, now a deluded vampire who believes he is the champion of the Shanshu prophecy, Wesley delivers Angel a vision from the Senior Partners explaining that the prophecy has always concerned Angel. When Angel realizes that the Senior Partners need him alive for their plans, he devises a plan to get himself killed, thus forcing them to <b>rewind</b> <b>time</b> to the last moment before Los Angeles was sent to hell. However, this would not reverse Wesley's death. Wesley is resigned to his fate, believing that he has nothing more to live for now that Fred is gone, and walks away, but not before asking Spike to take care of Illyria. In the new timeline, Angel names a wing of the Los Angeles public library in memory of Wesley and Fred.|$|E
50|$|While {{specifications}} vary somewhat {{between different}} drives, a typical LTO-3 drive {{will have a}} maximum <b>rewind</b> <b>time</b> of about 80 seconds and an average access time (from beginning of tape) of about 50 seconds. Because of the serpentine writing, rewinding often takes less time than the maximum. If a tape is written to full capacity, there is no <b>rewind</b> <b>time,</b> since the last pass is a reverse pass leaving the head {{at the beginning of}} the tape (number of tracks ÷ tracks written per pass is always an even number).|$|E

50|$|Hiro {{possessed the}} power to control the space-time continuum, giving him {{the power to}} {{manipulate}} the flow of time, travel through time, and teleport to any location at will, until Arthur Petrelli took it away when he traveled back to 1991. Specific examples of temporal manipulation include slowing time relative to himself and <b>rewinding</b> <b>time</b> specific to certain objects (a clock, a train, and a gun in various episodes). As demonstrated by his encounters with Daphne, a woman {{with the power of}} enhanced speed, Hiro does not stop time completely. Hiro has shown the ability to teleport both himself and others in physical contact with himself, both through space and time.|$|R
5000|$|After the Senior Partners <b>rewind</b> <b>time</b> after Angel {{is killed}} by Gunn, Angel renames a {{wing of the}} L.A. public library the [...] "Burkle Wyndam-Pryce Wing" [...] in honor of Fred and Wesley.|$|E
50|$|As in the prequel, the Prince {{possesses}} a limited control of time; the Sands {{can be used}} for more efficient combat as well as to slow down and even <b>rewind</b> <b>time,</b> allowing the Prince to retry ill-timed jumps or escape Dahaka's clutches.|$|E
5000|$|... 2. Time and Forgiveness plays as an {{ordinary}} platform game, {{except that the}} player may <b>rewind</b> <b>time</b> to undo their actions.

5000|$|The {{key feature}} of TimeShift is the player's {{ability to control}} time: slowing, {{stopping}} or even <b>rewinding</b> <b>time</b> more or less at will. This allows a player to stop time to dodge an incoming projectile or steal an enemy's weapon. Specific time-related puzzles also require these abilities. The player's abilities also affect {{the color of their}} environment in such that slowing time produces a blueshift, rewinding it produces a yellow haze, and stopping time creates a white filter [...] "haze". The player must use them wisely to make its way through the game. In some parts of the game the time powers are lengthened.|$|R
50|$|What {{follows is}} a {{high-speed}} car chase of the criminals, a hijacking of a bus, a highway shootout, and a shootout in and downing of a commercial airliner. Near the end, as a passenger in the falling airplane, Stuart is able to reverse the entire sequence of events because, being airborne, he has access to many cellphone relay systems and therefore is not restricted to the 10-minute limit. Stuart <b>rewinds</b> <b>time</b> to just before the bank robbery, taking Sarah with him, but Briggs grabs on as well and is <b>rewinded</b> too. This <b>time</b> Briggs decides not to rob the bank as he knows what will happen and that all of his men will die {{and he and his}} men leave without anyone being the wiser. This time Stuart is able to get a date with the teller by being himself and escapes using the Slipstream device from the bank when he is about to be arrested. Sarah is relieved that her partner is alive again and decides to let Stuart go as she knows he's harmless. The movie ends with Stuart having fun using the Slipstream device.|$|R
50|$|The book {{opens with}} scenes of {{astonishing}} opulence, beginning with Renée and Maxime lazing in a luxurious horse-drawn carriage, very slowly leaving a Parisian park (the Bois de Boulogne) in the 19th century-equivalent of a traffic jam. It is made clear {{very early on}} that these are staggeringly wealthy characters {{not subject to the}} cares faced by the public; they arrive at their mansion and spend hours being dressed by their servants prior to hosting a banquet attended by some of the richest people in Paris. There seems to be almost no continuity between this scene {{and the end of the}} previous novel, until the second chapter begins and Zola reveals that this opulent scene takes place almost fourteen years later. Zola then <b>rewinds</b> <b>time</b> to pick up the story practically minutes after La Fortune des Rougon ended.|$|R
50|$|After the Senior Partners <b>rewind</b> <b>time,</b> Angel and {{his crew}} {{are back in the}} Hyperion, running Angel Investigations as a {{business}} yet again, albeit with several difficulties due to Angel's newly acquired fame; most of their recent clients are fans and admirers rather than people who actually need help.|$|E
5000|$|Clockster (voiced by Richard Cansino) A time-controlling clock monster used by Divatox to <b>rewind</b> <b>time</b> {{when the}} Rangers kept beating her. Clockster's idiocy nearly stopped time forever, when touched a {{freezing}} device Divatox was using {{to start a}} new Ice Age. Clockster could also blast ring-shaped lasers from his eyes. This monster was destroyed by the Turbo Megazord.|$|E
50|$|Captains Scarlet and Blue and Destiny Angel {{come under}} attack from a {{squadron}} of reconstructed Angel fighter jets, but the other Spectrum Angels {{come to the rescue}} ("Seek and Destroy"). A later assault on Cloudbase results in the total destruction of the Spectrum headquarters, but the Mysterons use their extraordinary abilities to <b>rewind</b> <b>time,</b> leaving the base intact ("Attack on Cloudbase").|$|E
5000|$|Briggs {{eventually}} confronts Long as {{the latter}} completes {{the last of his}} ritual atop the Mountain of Time, becoming a towering monstrosity with numerous powers at his disposal. It is a bitter fight, with Briggs losing his weapons, having to fight with his bare hands, and even ripping out Long's heart without managing to slow the rampaging tyrant down. Only by decapitating Long and piercing his head with the business end of Kukulkan's Fangs is Briggs able to finally defeat him. This gives Briggs control of Long's [...] "sorcerer powers," [...] and, at the Mask's urging, he <b>rewinds</b> <b>time.</b> Briggs and Eva climb out of the mine to return home... only to find themselves amidst the historical Mayan empire, facing King Tep during his natural lifetime, with European sailing ships visible in the harbor beyond. The game ends on this cliffhanger.|$|R
500|$|Originally, Blow {{had envisioned}} {{the game to}} be broken into several {{different}} worlds as in the final game, each exploring facets of space, time, and causality, but with each world having very different high-level mechanics. One mechanic {{that he could not}} develop further was a world with no [...] "arrow of time" [...] that would have required the player to traverse the level in a manner that could be repeated in reverse. For example, the player would have been forbidden to jump down from a tall height while moving in forward time, as they {{would not be able to}} jump that height in reverse time. While this idea was not used, Blow discovered the rewind feature could be developed further for other aspects. Another game mechanic that Blow considered was to show the player the expected result of an action they would take; while this concept was informative, he did not find it to be an entertaining game mechanic. Blow had previously explored this in a prototype game called [...] "Oracle Billiards", the game predicting each billiards shot before it was made. He had found the billiards setting too chaotic for this idea and this led him to try out similar ideas in a simpler [...] "Mario-style" [...] setting. After selecting the game mechanics he wanted, he began adding puzzles that made philosophical points on his views on game design in general. After brainstorming more puzzles and concepts, Blow dropped the least interesting puzzles and worlds from the game. Blow wanted to include significant consequences of <b>rewinding</b> <b>time,</b> not found in games such as , , and Timeshift in which <b>rewinding</b> <b>time</b> creates few or no changes to the game's world. While these games immerse the player with these time-shifting effects using a first- or third-person perspective, he decided to use a 2D presentation. Blow noted that some of the puzzles in Braid would have been more difficult or impossible to solve in any other perspective.|$|R
