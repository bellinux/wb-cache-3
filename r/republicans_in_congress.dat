5|$|Even as the Thirteenth Amendment {{was working}} {{its way through the}} {{ratification}} process, <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> grew increasingly concerned about the potential for there to be a large increase in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would be counted rather than three-fifths, the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives. Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population.|$|E
5|$|<b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> {{claimed a}} mandate for abolition, having gained in the {{elections}} for Senate and House. The 1864 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Representative George H. Pendleton, led opposition to the measure. Republicans toned down their language of radical equality in order to broaden the amendment's coalition of supporters. In order to reassure critics worried that the amendment would tear apart the social fabric, some Republicans explicitly promised that the amendment would leave patriarchy intact.|$|E
5|$|Senator Henry Wilson, {{founder of}} the unit, was well known during the war for his antislavery {{political}} stance. After the war, {{he became one of}} the leading Radical <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress,</b> pressing for civil rights for former slaves and harsh treatment of former Confederates. In 1872, the same year he was elected Vice-President under Ulysses Grant, Wilson published the first volume of his History of the Rise and Fall of the Slave Power, a severe criticism of slave owners and their primary role, according to Wilson, in bringing about the Civil War.|$|E

50|$|In 1994, Gunderson was outed as gay on the House {{floor by}} {{representative}} Bob Dornan (R-CA) during {{a debate over}} federal funding for gay-friendly curricula, making {{him one of the}} first openly gay members of Congress and the first openly gay <b>Republican</b> representative. <b>In</b> 1996, Gunderson was the only <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> to vote against the Defense of Marriage Act, and he has been a vocal supporter of gay rights causes since leaving Congress. During his time in the House, Gunderson was one of only two gay <b>Republicans</b> serving <b>in</b> <b>Congress,</b> the other being Jim Kolbe of Arizona.|$|R
5|$|On January 3, 1861, Crittenden {{tried to}} salvage his plan by recommending {{to the full}} Senate that it be {{submitted}} {{to the people in}} referendum. It was widely believed that a referendum would recommend adoption of Crittenden's plan, and <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> used a variety of procedures to prevent a vote on allowing it. On January 16, with procedural delays exhausted, New Hampshire Senator Daniel Clark moved to substitute for Crittenden's plan a resolution stating that constitutional amendments were unnecessary to preserve the Union, and that enforcement of the Constitution and the present laws would eliminate the need for special sectional guarantees. With the senators from southern states (both those that had seceded and those that had not) refusing to vote, Republicans were left with a majority in the chamber and passed Clark's substitute resolution, effectively killing Crittenden's proposal.|$|E
5|$|Solis's {{confirmation}} hearings were held on January 9, 2009, before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Committee chair Ted Kennedy repeatedly praised her, while, despite examination by Republican members, Solis {{declined to discuss}} specific policy issues, including the Employee Free Choice Act. Several days later, Senate Republicans said they might try to put a procedural hold on her nomination because of her unwillingness to answer questions in detail in the hearings. By January 23, a secret hold {{was placed on the}} nomination by an anonymous Republican. A series of written questions and responses between Republican members and Solis followed, during which she was more forthcoming. Republican Mike Enzi pressed her on whether her unpaid high-level positions at American Rights at Work constituted prohibited lobbying activity; Solis denied violation of rules of conduct and stated she had not helped lobbying. Solis did acknowledge that she had failed to report those positions on her annual House financial disclosure forms at the time, which a White House spokesperson argued was an unintentional oversight. On February 2, Obama appointed veteran Labor Department official Edward C. Hugler as Acting Secretary. The prolonged process was considered by some Republican aides to be a preview of future battles on labor issues between the Obama administration and <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress.</b>|$|E
25|$|The party's {{official}} {{opposition to}} same-sex marriage came under attack. Meanwhile, social conservatives such as Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee remained opposed to same-sex marriage {{and warned that}} evangelicals would desert if the GOP dropped the issue. Many leaders from different factions spoke out in 2013 {{on the need for}} a new immigration policy in the wake of election results showing a sharp move away from the GOP among Hispanics and Asians, but the <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> could not agree on a program and nothing was done. <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> forced a government shutdown in late 2013 after narrowly averting similar fiscal crises in 2011 and 2012.|$|E
50|$|From 1965 to 1970, {{while he}} was a {{graduate}} student at Duke, Henry served two stints as a staffer for Congressman John B. Anderson (R-IL). During 1968 and 1969, while Anderson was the third-ranking <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress,</b> Henry's job involved promoting good communication within the party caucus.|$|R

25|$|From 1995 until 1997, Watts {{was only}} one of two black <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> (along with Gary Franks of Connecticut). From 1997 until 2003, Watts was the only black Republican Congressman. There would not be another until the {{elections}} of Tim Scott and Allen West in 2011.|$|E
25|$|In June 2016, <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> {{attempted}} to attach {{an amendment to}} a bill funding the fight against the Zika virus epidemic that would have reversed the flag ban. It was just one provision of several that Republicans had attached, including an amendment cutting Planned Parenthood funding. Senate Democrats blocked the bill through filibuster.|$|E
25|$|Goldwater only won {{his home}} state of Arizona and five states in the Deep South, {{depicted}} in red. The Southern states, traditionally Democratic up to that time, voted Republican primarily as a statement of opposition to the Civil Rights Act, which had been passed by Johnson and the Northern Democrats, as well as the majority of <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress,</b> earlier that year.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} downturn of 1937–38, and the bitter {{split between the}} AFL and CIO labor unions led to major <b>Republican</b> gains <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>in</b> 1938. Conservative <b>Republicans</b> and Democrats <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> joined <b>in</b> the informal Conservative Coalition. By 1942–43 they shut down relief {{programs such as the}} WPA and Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and blocked major liberal proposals. Roosevelt {{turned his attention to the}} war effort, and won reelection in 1940-44.|$|R
50|$|On June 25, 2014, House Republicans blocked {{funding for}} the D.C. law. The effort to keep the District from {{loosening}} its marijuana laws was led by Andy Harris, a <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> representing Maryland's 1st District which includes the Eastern Shore and Ocean City. The Harris amendment bans the D.C. government from spending any funds on efforts to lessen penalties for Schedule I federal drug crimes. Once enacted, the measure will interfere with DC's decriminalization law and a possible legalization ballot initiative.|$|R
25|$|The Democratic Party, proclaiming {{itself the}} party of white men, north and south, {{supported}} Johnson. However the <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> overrode his veto (the Senate by the close vote of 33:15, the House by 122:41) and the Civil Rights bill became law. Congress also passed a toned-down Freedmen's Bureau Bill; Johnson quickly vetoed {{as he had done}} to the previous bill. Once again, however, Congress had enough support and overrode Johnson's veto.|$|E
25|$|In his 1865 {{message to}} Congress, the Democratic Johnson {{contended that the}} only {{necessary}} proof of loyalty a state needed to show was ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment. <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> disagreed; Senator Charles Sumner and Representative Thaddeus Stevens thought black suffrage was vitally necessary to the nation's security and the continuing dominance of the Republican Party. Republicans used parliamentary procedures to ensure none of the Southern delegates, who were mostly former Confederate leaders, took a seat in Congress, and established a predominantly Republican joint committee to decide Reconstruction matters.|$|E
25|$|Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson both took {{moderate}} positions {{designed to}} bring the South back into the union as quickly as possible, while Radical <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> sought stronger measures to upgrade the rights of African Americans, including the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, while curtailing the rights of former Confederates, such as through {{the provisions of the}} Wade–Davis Bill. Johnson followed a lenient policy toward ex-Confederates. Lincoln's last speeches show that he was leaning toward supporting the enfranchisement of all freedmen, whereas Johnson was opposed to this.|$|E
50|$|Colorado voters {{approve the}} second {{proposed}} Constitution for the State of Colorado on 1865-09-01. Fearing a strengthened <b>Republican</b> majority <b>in</b> <b>Congress,</b> President Andrew Johnson refuses {{to declare the}} statehood of Colorado.|$|R

Following his interment in the family cemetery in Lee County, Virginia, his son C. Bascom Slemp was selected to fill his Congressional seat, and won re-election several times until unseated (as the last Virginia <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress)</b> during {{the rise of the}} Byrd Organization. The younger Slemp served as the United States Representative for the 9th District of Virginia from 1907 to 1922, and established the Slemp Foundation as well as the [...] Southwest Virginia Museum.|$|R
25|$|To {{address the}} excesses {{in the banking}} sector that precipitated the crisis, Obama signed the 2010 Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. This law limited bank {{risk-taking}} and overhauled the outdated regulatory regime that was ineffective in monitoring the non-depository or shadow banking sector {{at the core of}} the crisis, which had outgrown the traditional depository banking sector. It also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. However, it did not breakup the largest banks (which had grown even larger due to forced mergers during the crisis) or separate investment and depository banking, as the Glass-Steagal Act had done. Only a few <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> voted for the law.|$|E
25|$|In early 2001, President Bush {{worked with}} <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> to pass {{legislation}} changing the way the federal government regulated, taxed and funded charities and non-profit initiatives run by religious organizations. Although prior to the legislation {{it was possible for}} these organizations to receive federal assistance, the new legislation removed reporting requirements, which required the organizations to separate their charitable functions from their religious functions. Bush also created the White House Office of Faith Based and Community Initiatives. Days into his first term, Bush announced his commitment to channeling more federal aid to faith-based service organizations. Bush created the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives to assist faith-based service organizations. Critics claimed that this was an infringement of {{the separation of church and}} state.|$|E
25|$|After 1876, the {{frequency}} of lynching decreased somewhat until the later 19th century. White Democrats had regained political {{control of the state}} legislatures. Lynching was extrajudicial punishment, used by the society to terrorize freedmen and whites alike. Southern <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> sought to protect black voting rights by using Federal troops for enforcement. But, a congressional deal to elect Ohio Republican Rutherford B. Hayes as President in 1876 (in spite of his losing the popular vote to New York Democrat Samuel J. Tilden) included a pledge to end Reconstruction in the South. The Redeemers, many of whom had been members of such paramilitary groups as the White Cappers, the Knights of the White Camelia, the White League, and the Red Shirts, which supported white Democrats, had used terrorist violence and assassinations in order to suppress black and Republican voting and regain control of the state legislatures.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in 2015, {{the pilot}} Patriot Program {{provided}} funding to support 12 <b>Republican</b> candidates <b>in</b> key districts that historically voted Democrat in presidential elections. The program provides fundraising and organizational assistance {{with the goal}} of preserving a <b>Republican</b> majority <b>in</b> <b>Congress.</b> The incumbent candidates are considered vulnerable or close contests.|$|R
2500|$|The 2010 general {{elections}} placed a historic amount of <b>Republican</b> women <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> and [...] "many were also... heralded by Sarah Palin as being 'Mama Grizzlies.'"

25|$|As Treasury Secretary, Summers led the Clinton Administration's {{opposition}} to tax cuts {{proposed by the}} <b>Republican</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>in</b> 1999.|$|R
25|$|The {{hearings}} {{opened with}} the Steelworkers arguing for a wage and benefit increase estimated between 30 and 50 cents an hour, while the employers claimed no increase whatsoever was possible without price relief. ODM director Charles E. Wilson {{made it clear}} in a public statement on January 15 that the administration's inflation program would be wrecked if the workers succeeded in winning a wage increase larger than 4 cents an hour. Office of Price Stabilization economists were disturbed by the union's request. A secret internal memorandum by OPS staff members indicated that the union was actually due a 22-cents-an-hour wage increase, and that the steel companies could absorb up to 40 cents an hour in additional costs without a price hike. But for the union to win a wage increase without giving the employers price relief would appear inequitable and create political problems for both OPS and WSB with <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress.</b>|$|E
25|$|After the {{election}} of Obama for president, <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> were unified in almost total opposition to the programs and policies of Obama and the Democratic majority. They unsuccessfully attempted to stop an $814 billion stimulus spending program, new regulations on investment firms, and a program to require health insurance for all Americans. They did keep emissions trading from coming to a vote, and vow {{to continue to work}} to convince Americans that burning fossil fuel does not cause global warming. The slow growth of the economy {{in the first two years}} of the Obama administration led Republicans to call for a return to tax cuts and deregulation of businesses, which they perceived as the best way to solve the financial crisis. Obama's approval rating steadily declined in his first year in office before leveling off at about 50-50. This decline in popularity led to a GOP landslide in the mid-term elections of 2010.|$|E
25|$|Concerning Reconstruction, the President and Congress {{were deeply}} divided. Johnson, {{even when his}} amnesty policy had come under heavy criticism, had obdurately {{supported}} and continued it. Radical <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress,</b> however, came to prefer Stanton's military occupation proposal. The President's support from moderate Republicans dwindled after the gruesome anti-Negro riots in Memphis and New Orleans. The public seemed to be against Johnson as well. In the 1866 congressional elections, Republicans made sweeping gains on their Democratic rivals. In both the House and Senate elections, Republicans gained a two-thirds plurality of the seats. In the new year, some Republicans sought to use their majority to oust Johnson. They presented the Tenure of Office Bill, written with Stanton in mind. The President had long considered dismissing Stanton and replacing him with Maj. Gen. Sherman; the Tenure of Office Bill would have made this illegal without the advice and consent of Congress, which was unlikely to be given for Stanton, who was firmly supported by and cooperating with Radical Republicans. When the bill reached the President's desk, he vetoed it. His veto was overridden the same day.|$|E
5000|$|John Ripin Miller (born May 23, 1938), an American politician, was {{a member}} of the United States House of Representatives from 1985 to 1993.

25|$|One typical mid-century {{conservative}} <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> was Noah M. Mason (1882–1965), {{who represented}} a rural downstate district in Illinois from 1937 to 1962. Less flamboyant and {{less well known}} than his colleague Everett McKinley Dirksen, he ardently supported states' rights {{in order to minimize}} the federal role, for he feared federal regulation of business. He distrusted Roosevelt, and gave many speeches against high federal spending. He called out New Dealers, such as Eveline M. Burns, Henry A. Wallace, Adolph A. Berle, Jr., and Paul A. Porter, as socialists, and suggested their policies resembled fascism. He fought communism {{as a member of the}} House Un-American Activities Committee (1938–43), and in 1950 he championed Joe McCarthy's exposes.|$|R
2500|$|When Voinovich {{came to the}} Senate he was as {{prepared}} as anyone having previously been; Mayor of Cleveland, President of the National League of Cities, Governor and Chairman of the National Governors Association. Making {{clear that he was}} not intended on becoming the orchestra leader in the Senate but rather the 1st chair in a couple of sections, Voinovich picked out several committees where he would make his mark. Particularly in his first years in the Senate, Voinovich was opposed to lowering tax rates. He frequently joined Democrats on tax issues and in 2000 was the only <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> to vote against a bill providing for relief from the [...] "marriage penalty".|$|R
