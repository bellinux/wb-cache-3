5|$|Duration: For most goods, {{the longer}} a price change holds, {{the higher the}} {{elasticity}} is likely to be, {{as more and more}} consumers find they have the time and inclination to search for substitutes. When fuel prices increase suddenly, for instance, consumers may still fill up their empty tanks in the short run, but when prices <b>remain</b> <b>high</b> over several years, more consumers will reduce their demand for fuel by switching to carpooling or public transportation, investing in vehicles with greater fuel economy or taking other measures. This does not hold for consumer durables such as the cars themselves, however; eventually, it may become necessary for consumers to replace their present cars, so one would expect demand to be less elastic.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{renumbering}} in 2003, {{portions of}} US491 in New Mexico have been upgraded to a four-lane divided highway, with grade separations at the busiest interchanges. The New Mexico Department of Transportation has noted that, as sections are upgraded, fatality rates improve on the four-lane portions, but <b>remain</b> <b>high</b> on the two-lane portions. As construction has proceeded, {{the most dangerous}} portions of the highway have moved to points where the four-lane portion ends, and traffic merges to two lanes. This has caused the department to coordinate the phases of the upgrades to minimize the number of two-lane/four-lane transitions. Construction on the final phase was originally scheduled to begin January 2008, however the state applied for American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds to finish the project and completion was delayed until 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} garbage {{collection}} involves reading and rewriting {{data to the}} flash memory. This means that a new write from the host will first require a read of the whole block, a write of {{the parts of the}} block which still include valid data, and then a write of the new data. This can significantly reduce the performance of the system. Some SSD controllers implement background garbage collection (BGC), sometimes called idle garbage collection or idle-time garbage collection (ITGC), where the controller uses idle time to consolidate blocks of flash memory before the host needs to write new data. This enables the performance of the device to <b>remain</b> <b>high.</b>|$|E

5|$|Throughout the hurricane's track, it posed {{little to}} no threat to any major landmasses or {{populated}} islands. During Celia's early development stages, it brought moderate rainfall to parts of Oaxaca and Guerrero; however, no loss of life or structural damage was reported. Beaches in both states {{increased the number of}} lifeguards on duty since the threat of rip currents would <b>remain</b> <b>high</b> for several days. On June22, the Sistema Nacional de Protección Civil (National System of Civil Protection) in the Mexican state of Jalisco raised the alert level to stage two for coastal areas. People were urged to be cautious about venturing out into coastal waters as the storm produced rough seas near the coast. The alert was later expanded upon to include coastal areas of Michoacán and Colima. Although out of the storm's projected path, a precautionary alert was issued for Socorro Island. However, between June22 and 23, the outer bands of the storm brought unsettled weather to France's Clipperton Island. Since this island is unpopulated, the NHC did not issue any warnings for it.|$|E

25|$|Cushing's disease refers only to hypercortisolism {{secondary}} to excess production of ACTH from a corticotroph pituitary adenoma (secondary hypercortisolism/hypercorticism) or due to excess production of hypothalamus CRH (Corticotropin releasing hormone) (tertiary hypercortisolism/hypercorticism). This causes the blood ACTH levels {{to be elevated}} along with cortisol from the adrenal gland. The ACTH levels <b>remain</b> <b>high</b> because the tumor is unresponsive to negative feedback from high cortisol levels.|$|E

25|$|Less radical {{theories}} {{suggest that}} economic protectionism {{in developed countries}} hampers Africa's growth. When developing countries have harvested agricultural produce at low cost, they generally do not export as much as would be expected. Abundant farm subsidies and high import tariffs in the developed world, most notably those set by Japan, the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy, and the United States Department of Agriculture, {{are thought to be}} the cause. Although these subsidies and tariffs have been gradually reduced, they <b>remain</b> <b>high.</b>|$|E
25|$|Energy {{investment}} by workers {{required to produce}} reproductives is considerable. Newly emerged males and queens are no more functional than pupae; both depend heavily on solid prey brought in by workers, thus competing with larvae for food resources. As a result, worker quantity must <b>remain</b> <b>high</b> {{in order to maintain}} reproductive output. Workers must maintain food stores and defend the nest, and colonies whose work force diminishes too early in the colony’s life cycle will suffer a greater overall total loss in reproductives.|$|E

25|$|As ethanol yields improve or {{different}} feedstocks are introduced, ethanol production {{may become more}} economically feasible in the US. Currently, research on improving ethanol yields from each unit of corn is underway using biotechnology. Also, as long as oil prices <b>remain</b> <b>high,</b> the economical use of other feedstocks, such as cellulose, become viable. By-products such as straw or wood chips {{can be converted to}} ethanol. Fast growing species like switchgrass can be grown on land not suitable for other cash crops and yield high levels of ethanol per unit area.|$|E

The engagement ended when both sides exhausted their ammunition around 2:30pm. The Zeppelin was forced to <b>remain</b> <b>high</b> {{to stay out of}} range of the flak, this meant that the bombs were dropped from too great of height to strike the Allied patrol. There was no damage or casualties. After the action, the Zeppelins departed the area and the British vessels completed their patrol before returning to Rosyth.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{military}} personnel in Yemen is relatively high; in sum, Yemen has the second largest military force on the Arabian Peninsula after Saudi Arabia. In 2012 total active troops were estimated as follows: army, 390,000; navy, 7,000; and air force, 5,000. In September 2007, the government announced the reinstatement of compulsory military service. Yemen's defense budget, which in 2006 represented approximately 40 {{percent of the total}} government budget, is expected to <b>remain</b> <b>high</b> for the near term, as the military draft takes effect and internal security threats continue to escalate.

25|$|Many community-run bicycle {{programmes}} paint their bicycles in {{a strong}} solid colour, such as yellow or white. Painting the bicycles helps to advertise the programme, as well as deter theft (a painted-over bicycle frame is normally less desirable to a buyer). However, theft rates in many bike-sharing programmes <b>remain</b> <b>high,</b> as most shared-use bicycles have value only as basic transport, and may be resold to unsuspecting buyers after being cleaned and repainted. In response, some large-scale bike sharing programmes have designed their own bike using specialised frame designs and other parts to prevent disassembly and resale of stolen parts.|$|E
25|$|Third {{generation}} sequencing {{technologies have}} demonstrated promising prospects {{in solving the}} problem of transcript detection as well as mRNA abundance estimation {{at the level of}} transcripts. While error rates <b>remain</b> <b>high,</b> third generation sequencing technologies have the capability to produce much longer read lengths. Pacific Bioscience has introduced the iso-seq platform, proposing to sequence mRNA molecules at their full lengths. It is anticipated that Oxford Nanopore will put forth similar technologies. The trouble with higher error rates may be alleviated by supplementary high quality short reads. This approach has been previously tested and reported to reduce the error rate by more than 3 folds.|$|E

Ottoman-Somali cooperation against the Portuguese in the Indian Ocean reached a high point in the 1580s when Ajuran clients of the Somali coastal cities began to sympathize with the Arabs and Swahilis under Portuguese rule and sent an envoy to the Turkish corsair Mir Ali Bey for a joint expedition against the Portuguese. He agreed and was joined by a Somali fleet, which began attacking Portuguese colonies in Southeast Africa.|$|E
