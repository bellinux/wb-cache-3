40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} control {{algorithm}} for networks of multiple heterogeneous robot manipulators, which solves the leader follower and the leaderless consensus {{problems in the}} operational space. In the leader-follower scenario, the controller ensures that all the robots in the network asymptotically reach a given leader pose (position and orientation), provided that, at least, one follower robot {{has access to the}} leader pose. Without a leader pose, in the leaderless problem, the robots asymptotically reach a pose of consensus. The controller is a simple distributed proportional plus clamping injection (P+d) scheme which does not require velocity measurements. A singularity-free <b>representation,</b> <b>unit</b> quaternions, is used to describe the orientation of each manipulator.

40|$|Independently {{developed}} Web services {{often have}} different {{assumptions about the}} interpretation of the exchanged data, such as inconsistent data <b>representation,</b> <b>unit,</b> precision, and scaling. In practice, data misinterpretation results in many data quality problems and further hampers the execution of service composition. In this paper, we present a context-based mediation approach to handle inconsistent data interpretations and improve data quality for Web services composition. The assumptions about data interpretation of the involved services are made explicit and represented as contexts. A common ontology is defined to describe the contexts. Necessary conversions between elements of the contexts are implemented using XPath functions and external (e. g., third-party) services to reconcile inconsistent contexts. The WSDL descriptions of Web services are annotated with appropriate contexts using the W 3 C standard SAWSDL. Given a naïve composition ignoring contexts, the reasoning engine can automatically detect context conflicts within the naïve composition and reconcile these conflicts by producing a mediated composition that incorporates appropriate conversions. A proof-of-concept prototype, Context Mediation Tool (CMT), has been developed to validate and demonstrate the approach. 1...|$|E
40|$|Formulation {{of proper}} and {{efficient}} algorithms for robot kinematics {{is essential for}} the analysis and design of serial manipulators. Kinematic modeling of manipulators is most often performed in Cartesian space. However, due to disadvantages of most widely used mathematical constructs for description of orientation such as Euler angles and rotational matrices, a need for unambiguous, compact, singularity free, computationally efficient method for representing rotational information is imposed. As a solution, unit quaternions are proposed and kinematic modeling in dual quaternion space arose. In this paper, an overview of spatial descriptions and transformations that can be applied together within these spaces in order to solve kinematic problems is presented. Special emphasis is on a different mathematical formalisms used to represent attitude of a rigid body such as rotation matrix, Euler angles, axis-angle <b>representation,</b> <b>unit</b> quaternions, and their mutual relation.

40|$|Abstract. We study {{a variant}} of {{intersection}} <b>representations</b> with <b>unit</b> balls, that is, unit disks in the plane and unit intervals on the line. Given a planar graph and a bipartition of {{the edges of the}} graph into near and far sets, the goal is to represent the vertices of the graph by unit balls so that the balls representing two adjacent vertices intersect if and only if the corresponding edge is near. We consider the problem in the plane and prove that it is NP-hard to decide whether such a representation exists for a given edge-partition. On the other hand, every series-parallel graph admits such a <b>representation</b> with <b>unit</b> disks for any near/far labeling of the edges. We also show that the representation problem on the line is equivalent to {{a variant of}} a graph coloring. We give examples of girth- 4 planar and girth- 3 outerplanar graphs that have no such <b>representation</b> with <b>unit</b> intervals. On the other hand, all triangle-free outerplanar graphs and all graphs with maximum average degree less than 26 / 11 can always be represented. In particular, this gives a simple proof of representability of all planar graphs with large girth. ...|$|R

40|$|Bundle Adjustment is an {{iterative}} process where 3 D information is estimated from 2 D image measurements. Typically, {{the position of}} object points are estimated simultaneously with the position and orientation of the cameras. While the object points and camera positions have a straightforward "natural" parameterisation, several possibilities exist for the rotation. In this thesis, seven parameterisation of the rotation were investigated; Euler angles (two variants), the Rodriguez representation, the axis-and-angle <b>representation,</b> <b>unit</b> quaternions, and two variants of the direction cosine matrix (DCM). The Euler and Rodriguez parameterisation are common in photogrammetry and each has three parameters. The other parameterisations have more parameters and one or more constraint between them. The parameterisations were analyzed with respect to singularities, i. e. well-defined rotations {{that do not have}} any bounded and/or unique set of parameters. Four bundle adjustment experiments were setup, each corresponding to a singularity for one or more parameterisations. A fitth, singularity-free, experiment was also added. The experiments were perturbation studies that investigated the convergence properties of each parameterisation. The unconstrained parameterisations were solved by a damped and undamped Gauss-Newton algorithm, whereas the parameterisations with constraints were solved using damped and undamped algorithms based on the Gauss-Helmert estimation model. As expected, the parameterisations corresponding to the constructed singularity had higher failure rates and required more iterations and execution time than the others when it did converge. Excluding their singular cases, the Euler xyz and Rodriguez representations were the fastest with about 37 % of the dcm. Of the singularity-free parameterisation, the unit quaternion was the fastest with 79 % of the dcm. Surprisingly, the undamped bundle algorithms converged more often and faster than the damped bundle algorithms, even close to singularities. However, the undamped convergence was to a higher degree associated with numerical warnings and convergence toward angular values outside the nominal 2 range. The results suggest that if singularities are not expected, the Euler xyz and Rodriguez representations are the best of the tested parameterisations. Otherwise, the unit quaternion is the best. As an alternative to the latter case, the switching algorithm by Singla may be used, at the expense of a more complex algorithm...|$|E
40|$|Water {{consumption}} and wastewater generation depletes water resources {{and has a}} destructive impact on the environment. Recent attention has aimed at preserving water resources and preventing pollution through several routes. Restrictions on wastewater discharge into the environment, recycling, reuse and regeneration of wastewater streams are now common practices toward achieving these objectives. Membrane and integrated membrane processes {{have been shown to}} be effective at reducing water usage and recovering valuable compounds. This thesis focuses on topics related to the optimal synthesis of wastewater treatment networks by hybrid membrane systems. The use of superstructures has been a useful tool to synthesize chemical engineering process flowsheets. The approach postulates all possible alternatives of a potential treatment network. Within the representation, an optimal solution is assumed to be hidden in the given superstructure. State space is a framework to process synthesis problems which involves heat and mass exchange. In this <b>representation,</b> <b>unit</b> operations, utility units and utility streams can be embedded in such a way that all the process synthesis alternatives can be realized. Such a framework can be applied for water and wastewater synthesis problems. Several research optimization studies presented membrane and hybrid membrane process synthesis problems for wastewater treatment. Nonetheless, the problems in fact can be represented in several ways. Therefore, the mathematical programs are expected to be different for every postulated representation. Comparison between different representations and their mathematical programs are analyzed to highlight the relationship between the superstructure representation and their mathematical programming formulations. Possible improvement of these superstructures is addressed. Also, a generic representation is provided to give a systematic and clear description for assembling hybrid membrane system superstructures via the state space approach. The synthesis of reverse osmosis networks (RON) for water and wastewater treatment network is presented as a superstructure problem. The mathematical programming model describes the RON through a nonconvex mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP). A mixed integer linear program (MILP) is derived based on the convex relaxation of the nonconvex terms in the MINLP to bound the global optimum. The MILP models are solved iteratively to supply different initial guesses for the nonconvex MINLP model. It is found that such a procedure is effective in finding local optimum solutions in reasonable time. Water desalination and treatment of aqueous wastes from the pulp and paper industry are considered as case studies to illustrate the solution strategy. The RON mathematical program is a nonconvex MINLP which contains several local optima. A deterministic branch and bound (B&B) algorithm to determine the global optimum for the RON synthesis problem has also been developed. A piecewise MILP is derived based on the convex relaxation of the nonconvex terms present in the MINLP formulation to approximate the original nonconvex program and to obtain a valid lower bound on the global optimum. The MILP model is solved at every node in the branch and bound tree to verify the global optimality of the treatment network within a pre-specified gap tolerance. Several constraints are developed to simultaneously screen the treatment network alternatives during the search, tighten the variable bounds and consequently accelerate algorithm convergence. Water desalination is considered as a case study to illustrate this approach for global optimization of the RO network. Wastewater and groundwater streams contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) require proper treatment to comply with discharge standards or drinking requirement restrictions. Air stripping and pervaporation are two common treatment technologies for water streams contaminated with VOCs. The combination of these technologies for water treatment which are representative of hybrid membrane systems may offer advantages over stand-alone treatments. Superstructure optimization uses the framework of hybridization to determine the optimal treatment network and the optimal operational requirements for the treatment units to achieve desired water qualities. Two case studies are presented to illustrate the proposed approach and sensitivity of the optimal solutions to given perturbations is analyzed...|$|E
