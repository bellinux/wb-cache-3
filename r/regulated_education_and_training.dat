40|$|The {{shipping}} {{industry is}} among the most globalized of all industries and is characterized by complex modular supply chains, including a largely outsourced labor force of "just-in-time" casualized workers from developing countries and the transitional East European states. Despite long-standing efforts by international bodies to standardize <b>and</b> <b>regulate</b> the <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> of seafarers, variations in practices and standards persist. Employers exercise contradictory influences on <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> providers, on the one hand demanding the urgent provision of more recruits (encouraging corner-cutting), and on the other complaining about the poor quality of recruits received (urging crackdowns on poor quality providers and more rigorous examinations) - the training double bind. This paper reflects on these issues through the study of the problematic use of computerized assessments in seafarer examinations, drawing upon findings from a study involving research in six different case study countries providing maritime labor and interviews with stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|With the {{proposed}} {{introduction of a}} common framework for comparing qualifications within the European Union (EU), {{as a result of}} the Lisbon agreement of 2000, the question of commonly agreed transnational concepts of skills and qualifications is has become a pressing political and practical issue. The paper argues that there are grounds for doubting that there is a ready translation of the English terms 'skill'and 'qualification' in a way that avoids problems of comparing and calibrating German and English vocational qualifications. Reasons for this difficulty are explored, the most important of which relate to: a) the conceptual structure of skill and its cognates in the two languages; b) the differing socio-political role of qualifications; c) different industrial structures and labour processes; d) differences in institutions <b>regulating</b> vocational <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> (VET).

40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of an introduction and three studies, which are comparative sociological and institutional analyses {{of a number of}} countries' publicly <b>regulated</b> vocational <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> systems at upper secondary and post-secondary level. Official regulation of programme content and curricula - the main empirical material - is interpreted, and focus is directed on aspects which distinguish between, among others, general and vocational elements of teaching, learning <b>and</b> <b>training.</b> The analyses employ concepts from educational studies, historical sociology and institutional sociology with the aim of conceptual elaboration and illumination of similarities and differences between cases. Study I compares upper secondary vocational <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> programmes in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. The programmes are analysed and compared with respect to scope, sequence and selection of curricular units of subject matter <b>and</b> periods of <b>training.</b> Programmes combine general and vocational elements in various ways, thereby offering choices for obtaining both the occupation-related qualification, as well as higher education eligibility. The combination of curricular units with additional subject matter seems to, in some cases, lead to emerging learning aims. Study II focuses on vocational <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> systems at upper secondary level in Denmark, Norway and Sweden, and seeks to identify differences and similarities by conceptualising features of ideal types along different dimensions. It furthermore develops a method of analysis and visualisation which enables more accurate understanding of how various learning aims are designed within educational programmes. Some of the results indicate that the resources necessary for attaining the full, intended educational qualification are not guaranteed in any of the three cases; however, this applies particularly to apprenticeship-based programmes, where it can be attained only after training contracts with status-like features, resembling parts of occupational jurisdictions, are seized within sheltered circumstances. In the school-based programmes, a larger proportion of resources are guaranteed, but <b>training</b> is shorter <b>and</b> less vocationally oriented. Vocational <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> programmes in all three systems orient learning not only towards vocational, but also general learning aims. Study III compares admission criteria to post-secondary vocational <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> programmes in Denmark and Sweden, focusing on the Danish erhvervsakademi and the Swedish yrkeshögskola. Options, as elements of life chances, for individuals holding upper secondary vocational education qualifications who wish to apply for admission to these programmes, differ in terms of scope between the two cases. In the Swedish case, options are wide and mostly structured by course-based admission criteria; while in the Danish case, options are more narrow and structured by qualification-based admission criteria.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{aimed to}} explore the {{competencies}} of public health workers (PHWs) of township hospitals in Chongqing Municipality (China), and determine the related impact factors of the competencies of PHWs; Methods: A cross-sectional research was conducted on 314 PHWs from 27 township hospitals in three districts in Chongqing Municipality (China), from June to August 2014. A self-assessment questionnaire was established {{on the basis of}} literature reviews and a competency dictionary. The differences in competencies among the three districts were determined by adopting the chi-square test, t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA) method, and the impact factors of the competencies of PHWs were determined by adopting stepwise regression analysis. Results: (1) Results of the demographic characteristics of PHWs in three sample districts of Chongqing Municipality showed that a significant difference in age of PHWs (p = 0. 021 < 0. 05) and the majors of PHWs (p = 0. 045 < 0. 05); (2) In terms of the self-evaluation competency results of PHWs in township hospitals, seven among the 11 aspects were found to have significant differences in the three districts by the ANOVA test; (3) By adopting the t-test and ANOVA method, results {{of the relationship between the}} characteristics of PHWs and their competency scores showed that significant differences were found in the economic level (p = 0. 000 < 0. 05), age (p = 0. 000 < 0. 05), years of working (p = 0. 000 < 0. 05) and title of PHWs (p = 0. 000 < 0. 05); (4) Stepwise regression analysis was used to determine the impact factors of the competencies of PHWs in township hospitals, including the economic level (p = 0. 000 < 0. 001), years of working (p = 0. 000 < 0. 001), title (p = 0. 001 < 0. 005), and public health major (p = 0. 007 < 0. 01). Conclusions: The competencies of the township hospital staff in Chongqing Municipality (China), are generally insufficient, therefore, <b>regulating</b> the medical <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> skills of PHWs is crucial to improve the competencies of PHWs in the township hospitals of Chongqing Municipality. The results of this study can be mirrored in other areas of China...|$|R

A regulation governing the <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> of civil servants is the Indonesian Government Regulation Number 101 Year 2000 on <b>Education</b> <b>and</b> Job <b>Training</b> for Civil Servants. Improving the competence of civil servants through <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> become important in the career advancement of civil servants, <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> is often a requirement to fill a particular position. If the opportunity to participate in different training among civil servants of men and women, it will create different competencies, and in the end there are different opportunities for certain positions.

Respondents in this study were female civil servant who has held echelon positions of echelon 4 to 2 in all Local Government of Regencies / City and Province of Bali, which numbered 310 people. Samples were taken with a random sampling method. Data were collected through interviews and in-depth interviews.

40|$|M. Phil. (Adult <b>and</b> Community <b>Education)</b> The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa (1996 : 13) {{stipulates}} {{that everyone has}} the right to Basic <b>Education</b> <b>and</b> <b>Training</b> <b>and</b> to Further <b>Education</b> <b>and</b> <b>Training,</b> which the state through reasonable measures must make progressively available and accessible to all citizens. It has often been acknowledged that a well-developed Adult Basic <b>Education</b> <b>and</b> <b>Training</b> sector in the country could make a major contribution to South Africa's economic growth and general social development. The Adult Basic <b>Education</b> <b>and</b> <b>Training</b> Sector is meant to address the transformation of "night schools" into meaningful Adult Basic <b>Education</b> <b>and</b> <b>Training</b> centres. In 1997 the Department of Education adopted a framework for the implementation of Adult Basic <b>Education</b> <b>and</b> <b>Training.</b> This multi-year plan, informed the development of Adult Basic <b>Education</b> <b>and</b> <b>Training</b> plans at provincial level. Therefore, the Gauteng Department of Education's Adult Basic <b>Education</b> <b>and</b> <b>Training</b> plan set out a multi-level programme of action for four years, (1997 - 2000), which plan has now been strengthened by the promulgation of Adult Basic <b>Education</b> <b>and</b> <b>Training</b> Act No. 52 of 2000. The plan strategy as stipulated by the Department of Education (1997 : 4) sought to provide strategic direction for the transformation of Adult Basic <b>Education</b> <b>and</b> <b>Training</b> Centres in order to respond to the <b>Education</b> <b>and</b> <b>Training</b> needs of the citizens of this country.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to analyze how the enterprise <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> affect the quality of working life based on empirical results. This study contributes to deciding the directions for overall human resource development through examining workers perceptions related to enterprise <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training.</b> The main finding of this paper is that the enterprise performance through the <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> is determined by the various factors that influence the acceptances and perceptions of workers who received the <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> provided by enterprises, regardless of investment <b>and</b> implementation of <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> programs provided by the enterprises. In other words, the highly positive and aggressive factors interact with the strain factor accompanied with pressure, anxiety, and stress. This paper finally concludes as follows: First, the intensive and specified study is needed in order to clarify influence of the strain factors on firm performance. Second, workers recognition and influence on the <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> outcomes depend on the types of <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> such as the firm-specific training or the general training. If the introduction and application of enterprise <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> program reflect on the evaluation of the program, the positive effects of the enterprise <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> for workers can not be expected. Third, all types of enterprise <b>education</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> based on the voluntary participation of workers positively affect enterprise performance.
