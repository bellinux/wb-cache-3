30|$|The continual {{change in}} data renders {{classifiers}} ever more outdated as time progresses since their training. Therefore, the need arises for regular updates {{to the learning}} model, i.e., periodic classifier retraining. With data-dependent features such as in this work, it is advisable to perform feature selection anew before every retraining {{in order to better}} adapt to concept drift. Periodic feature selection causes the obsolescence of existing features and addition of new ones between two <b>retraining</b> <b>periods.</b> We refer to changes in the feature set caused by periodic feature selection as feature set drift. PDF is more susceptible to feature set drift than SWF due to the flexibility of its structural path definition. As Section 4.3. 3 shows, SPC is effectively used to reduce feature set drift in Hidost.|$|E
40|$|In visual search tasks, {{observers}} {{look for}} targets in displays containing distractors. Likelihood that targets {{will be missed}} varies with target prevalence, {{the frequency with which}} targets are presented across trials. Miss error rates are much higher at low target prevalence (1 %– 2 %) than at high prevalence (50 %). Unfortunately, low prevalence is characteristic of important search tasks such as airport security and medical screening where miss errors are dangerous. A series of experiments show this prevalence effect is very robust. In signal detection terms, the prevalence effect can be explained as a criterion shift and not a change in sensitivity. Several efforts to induce observers to adopt a better criterion fail. However, a regime of brief <b>retraining</b> <b>periods</b> with high prevalence and full feedback allows observers to hold a good criterion during periods of low prevalence with no feedback...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} work the authors successfully identified a radial basis function neural network to forecast the Portuguese electricity consumption profile within a 48 hour predictive horizon. As {{the model is}} a static mapping employing external dynamics and the electricity consumption trends and dynamics are varying with time, its predictive performance degrades after a certain period. One of the simpler ways to counteract this effect is by retraining the model at certain time intervals. In this paper this methodology is investigated considering regular and irregular <b>retraining</b> <b>periods.</b> For the latter, a criterion is defined in order to trigger the retraining procedure. The results obtained are compared to a nearest-neighbour predictive approach that achieves acceptable predictive performance and operates on a sliding window of data, therefore providing some level of adaptation. Also an analysis is made {{in order to find}} the time of day where the prediction error is smaller.

40|$|Abstract. Learned {{models of}} {{behavior}} have the disadvantage {{that they must}} be retrained after any change in system configuration. Autonomic management methods based upon learned models lose effectiveness during the <b>retraining</b> <b>period.</b> We propose a hybrid approach to autonomic resource management that combines management based upon learned models with “highly-reactive ” management that does not depend upon learning, history, or complete information. Whenever re-training is necessary, a highly-reactive algorithm serves as a fallback management strategy. This approach mitigates the risks involved in using learned models in the presence of unpredictable effects, including unplanned configuration changes and hidden influences upon performance not considered in the learned model. We use simulation to demonstrate the utility of the hybrid approach in mitigating pitfalls of both learning-based and highly-reactive approaches...|$|R

However, the causal functional role of the ipsilateral MC (iMC) for motor control is still not completely known. Here, the behavioral consequences of interference of the iMC during training of a complex motor skill were tested. Healthy old (58 - 85 years) and young volunteers (22 - 35 years) were tested in a double-blind, cross-over, sham-controlled design. Participants attended 2 different study arms with either cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (ctDCS) or sham concurrent with training. Motor performance was evaluated before, during, 90 min, and 24 h after training. During training, a reduced slope of performance with ctDCS relative to sham was observed in old compared with young (F = 5. 8, P = 0. 02), with a decrease of correctly rehearsed sequences, an effect that was evident even after 2 consecutive <b>retraining</b> <b>periods</b> without intervention. Furthermore, the older the subject, the more prominent was the disruptive effect of ctDCS (R(2) = 0. 50, P = 0. 01). These data provide direct evidence for a causal functional link between the iMC and motor skill acquisition in old subjects pointing toward the concept that the recruitment of iMC in old is an adaptive process in response to age-related declines in motor functions. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the design, implementation {{and performance of}} a scalable analysis platform {{for the detection of}} malicious content. To reflect the deployment of actual production systems, we design our platform to explicitly model the passage of time and the involvement of human supervisors in the analysis process. This thesis shows how our platform can operate efficiently at a large scale. The thesis presents and evaluates our platform {{in the context of a}} case study focused on malware detection. To model the passage of time while still allowing for batch training methods our platform discretizes time into a series of <b>retraining</b> <b>periods,</b> allowing updated samples and labels to emerge during each period. During each retraining period, our platform combines the presently deployed model with externally available information about newly emerged samples to select samples for submission to a human labeling oracle. To support a large volume of data over successive timeframes, our platform uses advanced techniques to manage the size of data including compression and selective data retention. These operations support efficient feature extraction. Our platform is implemented in Python, allowing use of both the Python scientific stack (Numpy, Scipy, Scikit-Learn) and IPython for interactive, distributed computation. In the interest of scalability our system uses HDFS and Apache Spark to manage distributed data and computation. This thesis discusses our implementation as well as the hardware and software configuration supporting our system. This thesis presents an evaluation of our work using a malware dataset containing over 1 million samples collected over a period of 2. 5 years. It begins by characterizing our dataset, including an examination of label shift over time motivating our work. It presents evidence demonstrating that by submitting a small fraction of samples for human review we are able to appreciably increase detection outcomes. We have released our code along with 3 % of our case study data, allowing replication of our results on a single node. Note that detection performance will vary due to the decrease in available training data...|$|E

O objetivo do presente estudo foi analisar os efeitos após destreinamento e retreinamento com pesos nas variáveis neuromusculares e desempenho funcional em um grupo de idosos. O grupo {{experimental}} contou com 10 participantes (sete mulheres e três homens) com idade de 64 ± 2, 35 anos, massa corporal de 71, 60 ± 9, 22 kg, estatura de 162, 16 ± 9, 74 cm e indíce de massa corporal de 27, 19 ± 5, 32 kg/m². Foram realizadas avaliações de força, (1 -RM no Leg Press 45 º, avaliações isocinéticas e isométricas) e avaliações funcionais (sentar e levantar, levantar e caminhar 3 m e subir e descer escadas). O grupo foi avaliado no período pré treinamento (controle), após o período de treinamento de 12 semanas e destreinamento (16 semanas) e após o perido de retreinamento (8 semanas). Os valores de 1 -RM após o período de destreinamento foram superiores ao período pré-treinamento (controle) (147 ± 43 kg vs 170 ± 27 kg; p 0, 05; ES: - 0, 18). Ocorreu aumento no pico de torque (PT) concêntrico de flexores de joelho entre os períodos de treinamento e retreinamento (81 ± 30 vs 110 ± 32 N·m, respectivamente; p Abstract : The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze neuromuscular and functional capacity (FC) in elderly after detraining and retraining of strength training. Experimental group had 10 participants (seven women and three men, aged 64 ± 2. 35 years, body mass 71. 60 ± 9. 22 kg kg, height 162. 16 ± 9. 74 cm, and body mass index 27. 19 ± 5. 32 kg/m²). Evaluations protocols were divided into two types, strength evaluations (1 -RM at Leg Press 45 º, dynamic isokinetic, and isometric) and functional capacity tests (30 -s chair stand, timed up and go, upstairs and down stairs test). These evaluations were made pre training, post training (12 week), post detraining (16 week) and at the end of retraining (8 week). Values after detraining period were superior to pre training period (146. 7 ± 43. 1 kg vs 170 ± 26, 6 kg; p< 0, 001; effect size [ES]: 0, 75), however significant losses were observed at 1 -RM in Leg press 45 º after detraining period (200. 7 ± 40. 5 vs 170 ± 26. 6 kg; respectively p< 0. 001; ES: - 0. 75). After retraining period increases ocurred in relation to post detraining (193 ± 30. 5 kg; ES: 0. 86) and after training to end of retraining no differences were found (200. 7 ± 40. 5 vs 193 ± 30. 5 kg; ES: - 0. 18). It was observed an increase in concentric peak torque (PT) of knee flexors comparing training period and end of retraining (80. 7 ± 29. 7 vs 110. 2 ± 31. 7 ES: 0. 99), also same was observed when compared retraining, and control period (74. 7 ± 25 N·m; p< 0. 05 ES: 0. 74). An increase in concentric PT knee extensors at 60 º·s- 1 and concentric PT from knee extensors and flexors at 240 º·s- 1 between weeks 16 and 24. Absolute rate of force development (RFD) increased in 0 ? 200 interval between control period and retraining (464 ± 170 vs 575 ± 217 N·m·s- 1; p< 0. 05 : 0. 14 ES: 0. 65). An increase occurred in number of repetitions of chair stand test between control period and retraining (14. 7 ± 2. 7 vs 19 ± 2. 5 ES: 1. 66), and between detraining and <b>retraining</b> <b>periods</b> (15. 8 ± 3. 3 vs 19 ± 2. 5 ES: 1. 23). Also an increase in time were found for timed up and go test from the end of the training to detraining (4. 4 ± 0. 8 vs 5. 1 ± 0. 5 s, ES: 1. 28). For climbing stairs test were found differences between control and detraining period (3. 7 ± 0. 9 vs 3. 0 ± 0. 4 s, ES: - 1. 8) and control to retraining (3. 7 ± 0. 9 vs 2. 8 ± 0. 5 s, ES: - 1. 6). Downstairs test the volunteers reduced their time to complete the task when compared with control period (3. 4 ± 0. 9 vs 2. 7 ± 0. 5 s, ES: - 0. 74). Based on results of present study, periodized resistance training did not promote a complete maintenance of neuromuscular variables, because the 1 -RM values after detraining were below training period. In addition PT values of knee extensors and flexors, PT isometric and RFD didn`t change after training therefore no losses were found after detraining period. Resistance periodized training promote a maintenance of FC of chair stand, upstairs and down stairs test, however timed up and go test were reduced to control period level. In conclusion, a periodized retraining of eigth weeks can promote gains in 1 -RM to values above control and similar to post training. Furthermore retraining can promote an increase in PT concentric and eccentric of knee flexors and performance in functional test of chair stand...|$|E

Here we report an extensive data set describing in detail skeletal muscle adaptations in {{structure and}} function in response to both disuse and retraining. Eight young men (23 ± 2. 2 years) underwent 3 weeks of unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS) followed by a 3 -week resistance training recovery program. Knee extensor isometric torque, voluntary activation, quadriceps femoris (QF) muscle volume (QFvol), fascicle length (Lf) and pennation angle (θ), physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of all four heads of the QF muscle, were measured before, after ULLS, and post-ULLS-resistance training. Needle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis muscle of a subgroup (n = 6) of the same subjects and cross sectional area of individual muscle s and myosin content of muscle samples were determined. Following 3 weeks of ULLS, isometric torque decreased by 26 %, PCSA by 3 %, QFvol by 10 %. Lf and θ of all four heads of QF significantly decreased (p ≤ 0. 05). Following the 3 -week <b>retraining</b> <b>period,</b> isometric torque, PCSA, QFvol, Lf and θ of all four heads of QF were all fully restored to pre ULLS values.

There were no significant changes in voluntary activation of the quadriceps muscles in response to either ULLS or subsequent retraining. These results indicate that: (1) the loss of muscle force with 3 -week unloading in humans is mostly explained by muscle atrophy and by a decrease in myosin content and, (2) all the neuromuscular changes induced by this model of disuse can be fully restored after a resistance training intervention of equal duration...|$|R

This was investigated in muscles undergoing a decrease (immobilization) and subsequent increase (resistance training) in activity level, compared with muscles with unaltered activity pattern. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed by 33 young healthy subjects. The subjects' right legs were immobilized with a cast for 2 wk, followed by a 6 -wk resistance training program for the right knee extensor muscles. The participants were supplemented throughout the study with either placebo (Pl group) or creatine (Cr group) or with creatine during immobilization and creatine plus protein during retraining (Cr+P group). Needle biopsies were bilaterally taken from the vastus lateralis. GLUT- 4 protein expression was reduced by the immobilization in all groups (P < 0. 05). During retraining, GLUT- 4 content increased (P < 0. 05) in both Cr (+ 24 %) and Cr+P (+ 33 %), which resulted in higher posttraining GLUT- 4 expression compared with Pl (P < 0. 05). Compared with Pl, muscle glycogen content was higher (P < 0. 05) in the trained leg in both Cr and Cr+P.

In order to prescribe the correct "dosage" for a specific problem, the exercise principles (frequency, intensity, duration and time) should be borne in mind. Another frequently asked question to the Biokineticist/ Exercise Physiologist is what the effect of detraining and retraining will be when an interruption occurs in the rehabilitation or conditioning regimen. Hence {{the aim of this}} study was to determine the effect of training frequency on some physical and hemodynamic parameters in the training and retraining of adult males. Sixty (60) healthy but sedentary Caucasian males aged 28 - 49 years were recruited to participate in this study. They were randomly selected into 3 groups of 20 each. Groups A and B served as the training groups while group C formed the control group which remained sedentary, and followed their normal lifestyle. The experimental groups (A & B) initially trained for 12 weeks at a training frequency of 3 times a week. This was followed by a detraining and retraining regimen of 12 weeks each. During the <b>retraining</b> <b>period,</b> Groups A and B retrained at a frequency of 2 and 4 times per week respectively. Some physical and hemodynamic parameters were assessed before (baseline) as well as after each phase. The physical working capacity (PWC) results of this study indicated that the experimental groups lost about 50 % of the gained benefits after 12 weeks of detraining. With retraining, a frequency of 2 times a week was able to maintain the level of PWC (Group A) while Group B, retraining at a frequency of 4 times a week, improved and exceeded the capacity reached after the initial training phase. The systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest indicated salutogenic changes following the training and retraining regimens, with deterioration during detraining. However, not all changes were statistically significant. The parameters representing the effectiveness of cardio-vascular functioning during exercise, viz. systolic blood pressure as well as double product at peak (DP peak) workload, reflected statistically significant improvement with a training frequency of 3 times a week. After 12 weeks of detraining, deterioration occurred in all mentioned parameters, but not to the pre-training level.
