2500|$|There {{are many}} meat dishes on Madeira, {{one of the}} most popular being espetada. Espetada is {{traditionally}} made of large chunks of beef rubbed in garlic, salt and bay leaf and marinated for 4 to 6 hours in Madeira wine, <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> <b>vinegar</b> and olive oil then skewered onto a bay laurel stick and left to grill over smouldering wood chips. These are so integral a part of traditional eating habits that a special iron stand is available with a T-shaped end, each branch of the [...] "T" [...] having a slot in the middle to hold a brochette (espeto in Portuguese); a small plate is then placed underneath to collect the juices. The brochettes are very long and have a V-shaped blade in order to pierce the meat more easily. It is usually accompanied with the local bread called bolo do caco.|$|E

40|$|The {{aroma of}} the three {{different}} classes of Sherry vinegar was evaluated by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography/olfactometry (GC-O). GC-O was employed to identify substances responsible for aromatic notes associated with the selected descriptors of the typical aroma of Sherry vinegar and odor activity values (OAV) calculated to measure the single impact effect of different compounds selected by GC-O. Diacetyl, isoamyl acetate, ethyl isobutyrate, isovaleric acid, sotolon, and ethyl acetate reached high OAVs, {{turning out to be}} characteristic odor active compounds in Sherry vinegars. A total of 58 compounds were quantified, among them, 7 had not been previously reported in Sherry wine vinegars: ethyl 2 -methylbutyrate, ethyl heptanoate, ethyl furoate, and ethyl benzoate, acetophenone, nonanoic acid, and sotolon. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) reveals that using aroma compounds as variables, we can classify Sherry vinegars with 100 % correct scores as different from <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> <b>vinegars...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{properties of}} traditional balsamic vinegar as regards its phenolic and flavonoid content {{comparing it to}} selected <b>vinegars</b> and <b>red</b> <b>wines</b> have been investigated. The polyphenols were separated from interfering compounds utilizing C 18 columns. The polyphenolic content was determined utilizing both Folin–Ciocalteu and peroxidase assays. The antioxidant capacity was quantified using both ABTS and FRAP assays. The results show that traditional balsamic vinegar has lower antioxidant activity and phenolic and flavonoid content than Nero d’Avola but higher than the other tested products. The antioxidant capacity of <b>wines</b> and <b>vinegars</b> is highly correlated with their phenolic content, measured by peroxidase assay {{and it is also}} highly correlated with their flavonoid content while in traditional balsamic vinegar and balsamic vinegar this correlation diminishes. The study describes a simple and fast method of separating from other compounds and of measuring polyphenols in the analysis of <b>red</b> <b>wines</b> and <b>vinegars</b> with complex composition such as traditional balsamic vinegar...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTwo simple {{methods have}} been {{developed}} to determine cadmium and lead in different kinds of beverages and vinegar leached from pewter cups produced in Brazil. Leaching experiments have been carried out with different solutions: beer, sugar cane spirit, <b>red</b> and white <b>wine,</b> <b>vinegar</b> and a 3 % acetic acid solution. The solutions were kept in cups with and without solder for 24 h. Lead and cadmium have been determined using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry with deuterium background correction. The limits of detection were 0. 05 and 1. 4 μgL− 1, and the characteristic mass was 1. 0 pg and 19 pg for Cd and Pb, respectively. With the developed methods it was possible to determine accurately cadmium and lead by direct analysis in these liquids and to evaluate the leaching of these metals from pewter cups. The results presented in this work show that pewter cups are not cadmium- and lead-free; this point goes against the manufacturers’ declaration that their products are lead-free...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work was to study the characteristics biometrics of the fruit {{and the effect of}} the physical and chemical scarification in the germination of seeds of Caesalpinia ferrea Mart. ex Tul. Ripe fruits were collected in August of 2007 of existent trees in the campus of the Rural Federal University of the Semi-arid, Mossoró- RN. The evaluations were carried at the Laboratory of Analysis of Seeds of the Department of Vegetable Sciences of UFERSA. The germination test was constituted of witness and 4 treatments (types of common vinegar: vinegar of alcohol, <b>vinegar</b> of <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> and <b>vinegar</b> of white <b>wine)</b> and hot water to 65 ºC, with 4 repetitions of 50 seeds. The sowing was in containers plastic with dimensions of 32. 5 x 24 x 4 cm (length, width and depth). The used substrates were sand washed sterilized previously and being irrigated with water distilled. The appraised characteristics were: mass of the fresh matter and matter dries of the seedling, germination percentage and index of emergency velocity.

40|$|Color and {{volatile}} preferences of Drosophila repleta were tested using sticky card and bottle traps. Species identity of D. repleta was confirmed using morphological characters; DNA COI sequence comparisons were inconclusive. Attraction to {{primary and secondary}} colors was tested with sticky cards in the laboratory; only primary colors were tested in the field. Laboratory trials were performed in clear plastic chambers. Other sticky card combinations included white, black, and grey. A white card with a black border was tested to examine contrast effects. Field trials were carried out at the University of Illinois Imported Swine Facility. Pinot Noir <b>red</b> <b>wine,</b> apple cider <b>vinegar,</b> and wet swine feed (the on-site material fed on by the flies) were used in volatile preference field trials.
