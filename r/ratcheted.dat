The foot is held onto the board with two buckle straps – one strapped {{across the top of}} the toe area, and one across the ankle area. They can be tightly <b>ratcheted</b> closed for a tight fit and good rider control of the board. Straps are typically padded to more evenly distribute pressure across the foot. While nowhere near as popular as two-strap bindings, some people prefer three-strap bindings for more specialized riding such as carving. The third strap tends to provide additional stiffness to the binding.|$|E
25|$|GDP, long {{stuck at}} its 1973 level {{even with a}} growing population, grew by about a third from early 1991 to late 1994. Fixed investment, {{depressed}} since the 1981–82 crisis, more than doubled during this period. Consumers also benefited: income poverty fell by about half (to under 20%) and new auto sales (likewise depressed since 1982) jumped fivefold, to about 500,000 units. This boom, however, had its problems early on. Tight federal budgets kept the budget deficits of the provinces from improving and, though many benefited from Cavallo's insistence that large employers translate higher productivity into higher pay, this same productivity boom (as well as the nearly 200,000 layoffs the privatizations caused) helped unemployment jump from about 7% in 1991–92 to over 12%, by 1994. The 1995 Mexican Crisis shocked consumer and business confidence and <b>ratcheted</b> joblessness to 18% (the highest since the 1930s).|$|E

25|$|Constance Myers {{indicates}} that three factors {{led to the}} expulsion of the Trotskyists from the Socialist Party in 1937: the divergence between the official Socialists and the Trotskyist faction on the issues, the determination of Altman's wing of the Militants to oust the Trotskyists, and Trotsky's own decision to move towards a break with the party. Recognizing that the Clarity faction had chosen to stand with the Altmanites and the Thomas group, Trotsky recommended that the Appeal group focus on disagreements over Spain to provoke a split. At the same time, Thomas, freshly returned from Spain, {{had come to the}} conclusion that the Trotskyists had joined the SP not to make it stronger, but to capture the organization for their own purposes. On June 24–25, 1937, a meeting of the Appeal faction's National Action Committee voted to <b>ratcheted</b> up the rhetoric against American Labor Party and Republican nominee for mayor of New York Fiorello LaGuardia, a favorite son of many in Socialist ranks, and to reestablish their newspaper, The Socialist Appeal. This was met with expulsions from the party beginning August 9 with a rump meeting of the Central Committee of Local New York, which expelled 52 New York Trotskyists by a vote of 48 to 2, with 18 abstentions, and ordering 70 more to be brought up on charges. Wholesale expulsions followed, with a major section of the YPSL leaving the party with the Trotskyists.|$|E

40|$|Quantum <b>ratchets</b> are Brownian motors {{in which}} the quantum {{dynamics}} of particles induces qualitatively new behavior. We review a series of experiments in which asymmetric semiconductor devices of sub-micron dimensions are used to study quantum <b>ratchets</b> for electrons. In rocked quantum-dot <b>ratchets</b> electron-wave interference is {{used to create a}} non-linear voltage response, leading to a <b>ratchet</b> effect. The direction of the net <b>ratchet</b> current in this type of device can be sensitively controlled by changing one of the following experimental variables: a small external magnetic field, the amplitude of the rocking force, or the Fermi energy. We also describe a tunneling <b>ratchet</b> {{in which the}} current direction depends on temperature. In our discussion of the tunneling <b>ratchet</b> we distinguish between three contributions to the non-linear current-voltage characteristics that lead to the <b>ratchet</b> effect: thermal excitation over energy barriers, tunneling through barriers, and wave reflection from barriers.

40|$|We {{show that}} ac driven skyrmions {{interacting}} with an asymmetric substrate provide a realization {{of a new}} class of <b>ratchet</b> system which we call a vector <b>ratchet</b> that arises due to the effect of the Magnus term on the skyrmion dynamics. In a vector <b>ratchet,</b> the dc motion induced by the ac drive can be described as a vector that can be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise relative to the substrate asymmetry direction. Up to a full 360 ^∘ rotation is possible for varied ac amplitudes or skyrmion densities. In contrast to overdamped systems, in which <b>ratchet</b> motion is always parallel to the substrate asymmetry direction, vector <b>ratchets</b> allow the <b>ratchet</b> motion to be in any direction relative to the substrate asymmetry. It is also possible to obtain a reversal in the direction of rotation of the vector <b>ratchet,</b> permitting the creation of a reversible vector <b>ratchet.</b> We examine vector <b>ratchets</b> for ac drives applied parallel or perpendicular to the substrate asymmetry direction, and show that reverse <b>ratchet</b> motion can be produced by collective effects. No reversals occur for an isolated skyrmion on an asymmetric substrate. Since a vector <b>ratchet</b> can produce motion in any direction, it could represent a new method for controlling skyrmion motion for spintronic applications. Comment: 10 pages, 13 figure...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{approach}} is presented {{based upon the}} Linear Matching Method framework in order to directly calculate the <b>ratchet</b> limit of structures subjected to arbitrary thermo-mechanical load histories. Traditionally, <b>ratchet</b> analysis methods have been based upon the fundamental premise of decomposing the cyclic load history into cyclic and constant components respectively, {{in order to assess}} the magnitude of additional constant loading a structure may accommodate before <b>ratcheting</b> occurs. The method proposed in this paper, for the first time, accurately and efficiently calculates the <b>ratchet</b> limit with respect to a proportional variation between the cyclic primary and secondary loads, as opposed to an additional primary load only. The method is a strain based approach and utilises a novel convergence scheme in order to calculate an approximate <b>ratchet</b> boundary based upon a predefined target magnitude of <b>ratchet</b> strain per cycle.
