5|$|In 2001, English singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor {{covered the}} song for her debut studio album <b>Read</b> <b>My</b> <b>Lips.</b> It served as her debut solo single after being signed by Polydor Records. Her version {{contains}} new lyrics and a disco-tinged instrumental, and elicited a mostly positive response from critics; it also enjoyed commercial success. However, Cher was reportedly critical of this version, finding its lyrics too overtly sexual.|$|E
5|$|Her solo debut album, <b>Read</b> <b>My</b> <b>Lips,</b> was {{released}} in September 2001. The album reached number two on the UK Albums Chart and was certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). The record experienced international success; it sold more than 1.5 million albums worldwide. It produced four singles, three of which reached the top three in the UK.

500|$|... "Take Me Home" [...] (also {{known as}} [...] "Take Me Home (A Girl Like Me)") {{was covered by}} English {{recording}} artist Sophie Ellis-Bextor for her debut studio album <b>Read</b> <b>My</b> <b>Lips</b> (2001). It contains rewritten lyrics by Ellis-Bextor, while production {{and a number of}} tasks were handled by British musician Damian LeGassick. It was released by Polydor Records as a digital download and a CD single on 13 August 2001 alongside a remix and B-side track [...] "Sparkle".|$|E
5000|$|Lyrically, {{it finds}} Gwen Stefani {{adjusting}} to unfamiliar circumstances but declaring that she'll be fine, [...] "'I'm a rough and tough/ Nothing's gonna knock this girl down.'" [...] "What's your twenty? Where's your brain?" [...] Gwen asks {{herself in the}} first few lines, eventually responding with the unequivocal [...] "I'm fine / I'm hella positive, for real, I'm all good," [...] and concluding in the chorus [...] "But you can see it my eyes, you can <b>read</b> on <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> / I'm trying to get a hold on this / And I really mean it this time." [...] The song also has the positive mental attitude that is specific to the reggae genre. For Amy Sciarretto of Pop Crush, when she sings [...] "But you can see it my eyes, you can <b>read</b> on <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> / I'm trying to get a hold on this / And I really mean it this time /And you know it's such a trip / Don't get me started / I'm trying to get a hold on this," [...] we are left to assume that Stefani is singing about her desire to finally make a commitment. She's ready, willing and able. She just wants her man to be patient and [...] "settle down." [...] And then she can [...] "settle down" [...] with him.|$|R
6000|$|The Invisible Presence <b>read</b> <b>my</b> thought. I felt <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> touched, as <b>my</b> husband's <b>lips</b> used {{to touch}} them when he kissed me. And that was my answer. A thought came to me again. I would have said, if I could have spoken: [...] "Are you here {{to take me to}} the better world?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Such {{were the}} {{thoughts}} which passed through me, and I think that {{something of the}} tenor of them communicated itself to Marie, who often could <b>read</b> <b>my</b> heart before <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> spoke. At any rate, her demeanour changed. She drew herself up. Her fine nostrils expanded and a proud look came into her dark eyes, as she nodded her head and murmured in a voice so low that I think I alone caught her words: ...|$|R
500|$|After {{releasing}} {{her debut}} single [...] "Take Me Home", Polydor Records issued her first studio album <b>Read</b> <b>My</b> <b>Lips</b> on 27 August 2001 which primarily tended towards a disco and electronica-inspired sound. The album and its reissue spawned four singles, including the worldwide success [...] "Murder on the Dancefloor". On 16 October 2003 Ellis-Bextor released her sophomore studio album Shoot from the Hip. For the album, Ellis-Bextor worked with many musicians, including Alex James and Bernard Butler, {{which resulted in}} a Europop-influenced sound. It spawned the successful singles [...] "Mixed Up World" [...] and [...] "I Won't Change You", which reached the top 10 of the UK Singles Chart.|$|E
500|$|To {{promote the}} song, Sophie Muller filmed a music video for [...] "Take Me Home" [...] which was {{released}} on the song's CD single. The video was also included in her video album Watch My Lips (2002).' It opens with Ellis-Bextor, {{dressed in a black}} one-strap dress, in front of a yellow-toned painting of a woman with red lips. Throughout the music video, Ellis-Bextor is seen in a variety of dresses and outfits—she appears {{standing in front of a}} green mural with a flowery large tablecloth, while dressing a see-through shirt, which reveals her black bra; other scene shows her with a dark green gown; other shows her with a flower and leaves pattern and holding a in front of a projected image which shows the Eiffel Tower from far. She also appears dressed in a green trench coat in another scene. Usually, costume and location scenes are accompanied by a change of gradient color, which are projected onto Ellis-Bextor. By the middle of the video, she walks across a street, surrounded by formally-dressed men, who dance around her and lift her. After the song's middle 8 plays, the lights of the street turn on and various French event posters are shown. The video concludes as they all enter a disco club. She also performed the track at the <b>Read</b> <b>My</b> <b>Lips</b> Tour (2002–03), serving as its encore. Ellis-Bextor would shortly introduce the song, with green eye makeup and red lipstick, dressed in a cream-colored dress and pink heels. As the backing track started playing, she would start singing and clapping her hands as the public imitated her, and the audience was showered with confetti.|$|E

6000|$|She held me with hungry arms. She {{whispered to}} me, [...] "There, there!" [...] as one whispers comfort to a child. [...] . Suddenly she was kissing me.

But not even love's ashes were in my heart, except, perhaps, those in which Fanny had scrawled her name.|$|R
