In this report, we demonstrate that the colon cancer cell SW 620 expresses functional Fas ligand (FasL), the triggering agent of Fas receptor (FasR) -mediated apoptosis within the immune system. FasL mRNA and cell surface FasL were detected in SW 620 cells using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical staining, respectively. We show that SW 620 kills Jurkat T cells in a Fas-mediated manner. FasR-specific antisense oligonucleotide treatment, which transiently inhibited FasR expression, completely protected Jurkat cells from killing by SW 620. FasL-specific antisense oligonucleotide treatment of SW 620 inhibited its Jurkat-killing activity. FasL has recently been established as a mediator of immune privilege in mouse retina and testis. Our finding that colon cancer cells express functional FasL suggests it may play an analogous <b>role</b> in <b>bestowing</b> immune privilege on human tumors.

The analysis of happiness {{from the perspective of}} the quality of life is a unique development in human rights literature. This analysis is based on people having an active <b>role</b> in <b>bestowing</b> meaning on different components of their life. People have the means and the power to decide whether their life is good or bad by taking into account their subjective perceptions, such as how different domains, such as the family, professional, and civic realms, of their lives interact and what their meanings for their entire lives are. In truth, modern society, faced with multiple risks of development, has to be controlled by the wisdom or rationality of collective ethics principles in order to grant individual satisfaction. Its means of development through cutting edge technology can contribute to human accomplishments, but also to human downfalls. Thus, in a modern culture, responsible control of technology becomes mandatory. In today’s world, it is impossible to talk about individual satisfaction without collective morals, without the collective responsibility that guides the directions of development of humankind. This book discusses the issue of quality of life, and sustains a pragmatic vision of the pursuit of happiness and well-being, based on changes aimed at the continual improvement of one’s interior and exterior universe...|$|R
40|$|TNF-alpha-related-apoptosis-inducing-ligand (TRAIL) {{has been}} {{explored}} as a therapeutic drug to kill cancer cells. Cancer {{cells in the}} circulation are subjected to apoptosis-inducing factors. Despite {{the presence of these}} factors, cells are able to extravasate and metastasize. The homotypic and heterotypic cell-cell interactions in a tumor are known to play a crucial <b>role</b> in <b>bestowing</b> important characteristics to cancer cells that leave the primary site. Spheroid cell culture has been extensively used to mimic these physiologically relevant interactions. In this work, we show that the breast cancer cell lines BT 20 and MCF 7, cultured as 3 D tumor spheroids, are more resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis by downregulating the expression of death receptors (DR 4 and DR 5) that initiate TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. For comparison, we also investigated the effect of TRAIL on cells cultured as a 2 D monolayer. Our results indicate that tumor spheroids are enriched for CD 44 hiCD 24 loALDH 1 hi cells, a phenotype that is predominantly known to be a marker for breast cancer stem cells. Furthermore, we attribute the TRAIL-resistance and cancer stem cell phenotype observed in tumor spheroids to the upregulation of cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) /prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) pathway. We show that inhibition of the COX- 2 /PGE 2 pathway by treating tumor spheroids with NS- 398, a selective COX- 2 inhibitor, reverses the TRAIL-resistance and decreases the incidence of a CD 44 hiCD 24 lo population. Additionally, we show that siRNA mediated knockdown of COX- 2 expression in MCF 7 cells render them sensitive to TRAIL by increasing the expression of DR 4 and DR 5.

50|$|The end of superpower rivalry had {{freed the}} UN and other {{regional}} security institutions from their previous Cold War mind-set, and created {{new opportunities for}} them to play a more active, collective role.

International organizations such as the UN and regional security such as NATO, the OAS, and the OAU would play a <b>role</b> in <b>bestowing</b> legitimacy on the operations and in organizing a collective response. Domestically however, these new developments at the international level became enmeshed with a long-standing struggle between Congress and the president over war powers, and differences in treaties between domestic and international understandings of the term. Which branch of government was to control the deployment of American troops occupied these debates almost as much as the merits of the individual interventions. These debates were not new, with the struggle over war powers being a constant feature of American foreign policy, especially since WWII when it first gained superpower status, joined international organizations, and signed its first mutual defense treaty in more that 150 years. Clinton would utilize both the multi-national cast and the explicit blessing of international organizations for support in most of these involvements. These largely humanitarian operations during his term met much more congressional opposition, and enjoyed less frequent congressional authorization, than did operations during the Cold War. This involvement suggests that the president had found international organizations to be a useful ally in part to decrease and to overcome the resistance of the national legislature.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} rise of the creative writing program in American higher education and considers its influence on contemporary American poetry. I investigate how the patronage of the university has impacted American poetry and reconfigured the contemporary literary landscape. Using Mark McGurl's (2009) groundbreaking research on post-World War II fiction and {{the rise of}} the creative writing program as a launching point, I consider the following questions: (1) How might contemporary American poetry be understood in relation to the rise of mass higher education and the creative writing program? (2) How and why has the creative writing program reorganized U. S. poetry production in the postwar period?, and (3) How can {{the rise of the}} creative writing program be brought to bear on a reading of contemporary poetry itself? Investigating beyond the well-worn claim that institutionalized creative writing programs produce McPoetry, this humanities-based research examines the ascents of three of America's most celebrated living poets. First, I investigate Kay Ryan's rise as an "outsider" poet happily unaffiliated with creative writing programs. Through close readings, I consider how the most dominant and idiosyncratic craft elements in her writing are a partial result of her avoidance of the homogenizing forces of the creative writing workshop. I then examine Jorie Graham's influence as a former faculty member at Iowa Writers Workshop, the most prestigious and indisputably powerful M. F. A. program in the nation, and as a current professor at Harvard University. I examine distinguishing features of Graham's work and trace threads of connection in the poetry of other Elliptical poets who have been heavily influenced by her. I consider how Graham's work necessitates literary scholarship and how those granted power by their institution in turn bolster Graham's body of work. In particular, I examine Helen Vendler's role, as our nation's most powerful poetry critic, in promoting Graham's poetry and popularizing a set of aesthetic values modeled largely after Graham's. Next, I consider Billy Collins' aggressive courting of the general reader of poetry as an antidote to academe's exclusion of non-specialist readers. I argue that Collins' impressive popularity and subversive tendencies serve as a counterweight to the literary authority of "official verse" culture. The examination of Billy Collins, Jorie Graham, and Kay Ryan aims to illuminate higher education's <b>role</b> in <b>bestowing</b> cultural authority on particular poets and kinds of poetry...|$|R
40|$|During post-conflict reconstruction, various <b>roles</b> are <b>bestowed</b> on {{teachers}} {{to manage the}} effects of violence such as peace educator, conflict resolution expert, counsellor and so on. However, there are no empirical studies that examine what teachers actually do {{when faced with the}} challenges of post-conflict schooling. More importantly, most policies often neglect the fact that teachers are not necessarily neutral in conflict. Whilst being professionals, many are also political and social beings that come from the community they serve. Surely the tension between their personal beliefs and professional practice has some impact on how teachers deal with the effects of conflict. This research investigates how teachers, who maintain a reflexive relationship with their community, feel about transforming their role to manage the effects of ethnic conflict. The case of Kenya offers a suitable context in which to research this particular phenomenon because of its continuous association with conflict, consequent corrosion in ethnic relations, and increasing ethnic segregation in education systems. Employing a case study strategy, data was collected using semi-structured interviews and document analysis. The sample size consisted of twenty head teachers and seventy teachers and counsellors from government secondary schools in Nakuru and Kericho. Analysis of the data suggests that ethnic tensions have seeped into schools affecting not only peer relationships but also teacher-student interactions. These tensions and fears continue to impair teachers from actively participating in schools and assuming the role of managing the effects of the conflict. Aside from this, various other factors in their classroots realities shape {{the manner in which they}} deal with the effects of the conflict. Some of these factors include external support, professional capacity, their purpose and motivation as well as the school culture. This research concludes that teachers require adequate support and guidance from their head teacher in order to conceptualise their role in relation to managing the effects of violence. While the focus of external institutions is on relaying concepts of ‘peace’ and ‘conflict resolution’ to the students, there is merit in taking a more gradual approach and equipping teachers with the necessary skills and knowledge to teach these concepts. Moreover, teachers too require space to confront their own biases and prejudices towards other groups in order to assume these new roles. Finally, the creation of support networks is essential during post-conflict reconstruction as it ensures that teachers and students are provided with the necessary guidance, knowledge, and assistance in the absence of support from the state.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{concentrates on}} a particular exemplification of {{the ideal of the}} unity of science in the history of twentieth-century philosophy. Taking Rudolf Carnap (1891 [...] 1970) as an exemplar of a scholar whose work in philosophy of science was at bottom motivated by the ideal of a unified conception of science, it attempts to distillate the essential characteristics and methodological significance of such a conception by a combination of historical and systematic analysis. Given the conspicuously holoscopic character of Carnap's philosophical orientation, there arises an interesting question about the relation of his work to that of other prominent ``seekers of the wider view'' in the history of philosophy (and history of science). On a more general level, we ask what kind of intellectual and moral characteristics are associated with a scholar who is motivated by the unification of science. Making it explicit: if a coherent conception of a unified conception of science is conceivable, what kind of normative criteria can then be applied to a scholar and his actions? In other words, what are the external and internal qualifications of scholar's vocation under the unified conception of science? In {{the first part of the}} dissertation we provide a general account of the problem's background in the intersection of intellectual history and systematics. In the first chapter main emphasis will be put to the dialectic between agent-based and structural explanations in historiography. The survey of a few exemplars of models of historical explanation is intended to provide a background framework for discussing the relation between descriptive analysis and analysis of values. In as much as our modern scientific world conception and the general, essentially human, consciousness of the domain of validity seem to be in a fundamental conflict, a philosophical clarification of the issues that depend on this fundamental distinction is contingent on having proper tools at its disposal. Indeed, it is necessary to acknowledge [...] with respect to both scientific knowledge and moral positions [...] that the issues of genesis and validity have little in common. Both the image of nature, built upon the masses of scientific and technological knowledge gathered, and the modern conceptions of the moral have developed in the course of history. The lesson that historicism can teach us is the possibility to adopt a symmetrical attitude with respect to the status of the questions of genesis and validity within these (very different) domains. This symmetric attitude enables us to see that the validity of a theory or position (in science or in moral philosophy) cannot depend on the diachronic aspects of its genesis. Rather, it is precisely the case that the late appearance of certain scientific theories and certain moral positions is an index that they are complex and presuppose a great deal genetically, and this is seen to be a common feature of all good theories. Thus, in order to approach the evolution of these ideas from a general perspective, we have to acknowledge their fundamental ontological difference and adopt a variety of tools to study these domains. I present four different approaches to the study of historical phenomena that appertain to the themes of this dissertation. In the second chapter we provide a synopsis of the important thematic about the relationship between morals and science. After a brief examination of the concepts of the moral and the scientific, we proceed to give an account of the concept of scientific self which acts as a kind of normative meta-concept co-ordinating the interaction between the epistemic and the ethical requirements appertaining to the education and professional formation of a scientist. From a historical perspective it is easy to to see that the intension of the concept of scientific self varies according to the contingent factors such as the external conditions of education and the requirements set by new experimental techniques, but the essential, axiologically relevant, internal determinates of the concept are seen to accumulate over time in a conservative manner. Especially interesting here are the determinates that can be traced back to the complementary intellectual traditions of Enlightenment and Romanticism. One of the most important exemplifications of an articulated conception of scientific self can be found in J. G. Fichte's ``Vorlesungen über die Bestimmung des Gelehrten'' of 1794. In these lectures Fichte develops a beautiful [...] and still highly relevant [...] conception of the true goals of a scholar as well as the qualifications he must fulfill to attain those goals. From Fichte we turn to study the history of one particular intellectual virtue that has direct relevance for the questions tackled in the second part of the dissertation, viz. tolerance. In the third chapter we focus on the importance of a priori knowledge for both ethics and science. These themes are developed only in their barest outlines in order to provide some theoretical support to the fundamental philosophical thesis of the dissertation concerning the distinction between Is and Ought, and its relevance for the question of the unity of science. We will briefly touch upon the question about the relationship of a priori and empirical knowledge in ethics, and provide a brief synopsis of the relevance of the distinction analytic/synthetic in this domain. Finally we address cursorily the ontologically crucial problem about the moral element in man and present [...] with a view to the Enlightenment virtues [...] a synopsis of the process of the dissociation of the concept of the moral from the concept of the scientific. We describe the characteristics of ethical impulse in modern times and the quite idiosyncratic view on morals and especially on moral justification advocated by the members of Vienna Circle. We will see how the dissociation of the moral from the domain of the rational discourse inevitably results in the philosophically poverished stance of moral non-cognitivism which Carnap maintained throughout his career. In the second part of the dissertation we can finally address the adduced problem in its particular ramifications in the philosophy of Rudolf Carnap. Given this general problematic, we attempt to vindicate the underlying overall motivation of Carnap's philosophy and to reconstruct the architectonic of Carnap's systematic thought in the light of recent research. One of the main tasks is to evaluate the coherence of interpretations provided in the research literature which place Carnap in the continuum of thinkers that are, in some sense, committed to the ideals and values of Enlightenment. The most explicit rendering of this line of thought is the recent monograph, Carnap and Twentieth-Century Thought, by A. W. Carus which puts Carnap's method of explication on center stage. I critically examine this line of interpretation indicated by Carus and explore more deeply its historical dimensions. Over and above the interpretation of Carus, we assess to what extent Carnap's philosophical program fulfills the criteria that are imposed upon it by the requirement of an Enlightenment conception of unified science. The central significance of logic and mathematics in Carnap's philosophical program is seen to derive from the fundamental conception of Carnap that within the total system of knowledge logic and mathematics are performing the essential role of supplying the forms of concepts, statements, and inferences, forms which are then applicable everywhere, hence also to non-logical knowledge. Therefore, the demarcation between logical and non-logical expressions, along with the Principle of Tolerance and logical pluralism, constitutes one of the central strands of Carnap's thought. Indeed, the Principle of Tolerance and the logicality criterion are seen to be two inextricably entwined aspects of a solution to a fundamental problem that Carnap searches a solution to and which characterizes his aspirations throughout the period under consideration here, i. e. the problem of the rationality of scientific discourse under the variability of linguistic systems of knowledge representation. I depict the overall development of Carnap's philosophy with this central idea continually in focus. As a supplement to the interpretation of Carnap's program as a concerted attempt to look for the fundamental invariants of thought and experience, I provide the view that a necessary condition for implementing his ideal of explication is a coherent formulation of what might be called the task of providing genealogies of important scientific concepts and ideas. This complies with the attractive account represented by Howard Stein about the two basic functions of philosophy, i. e., a distinction between ``the enterprise of knowledge'' and the ``enterprise of understanding''. It is argued here that an essential ingredient of Carnap's method of explication is a variety of philosophical history of science which provides the necessary insight into the problem complex one is tackling with under the purview of explication. Therefore, a significant <b>role</b> is <b>bestowed</b> upon historical knowledge and historiography. I attempt to accommodate this aspect of the ``enterprise of understanding'' within the more explicitly confined ``enterprise of knowledge'' that Carnap was overtly concerned with. However, it is argued that the ``enterprise of understanding'' constituted an equally important aspect of Carnap's philosophical program, although it remained covert in his publications.
