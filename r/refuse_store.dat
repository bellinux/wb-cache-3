50|$|According to one tradition, <b>refuse</b> was <b>stored</b> on {{the lowest}} of the ark's three decks, humans and clean beasts on the second, and the unclean animals and birds on the top; a differing {{interpretation}} described the <b>refuse</b> as being <b>stored</b> on the utmost deck, from where it was shoveled into the sea through a trapdoor. Precious stones, said to be as bright as the noon sun, provided light, and God ensured that food remained fresh. Some more unorthodox interpretations of the ark narrative also surfaced: the 12th-century Jewish commentator Abraham ibn Ezra interpreted the ark as being a vessel that remained underwater for 40 days, after which it floated to the surface.|$|R
5000|$|Making matters worse, Hudson's {{department}} <b>stores</b> <b>refused</b> {{to carry}} the album. Tensions between the band and the Hudson's chain escalated {{to the point that}} the department <b>stores</b> <b>refused</b> to carry any album from the Elektra label after MC5 took out a full-page ad that, according to Danny Fields, [...] "was just a picture of Rob Tyner, and the only copy was 'Fuck Hudson's.' And it had the Elektra logo". To end the conflict and to avoid further financial loss, Elektra dropped MC5 from their record label.|$|R
50|$|Charlevoix has {{one movie}} tri-plex theater {{embedded}} within its downtown and no big box shopping outlets except for Kmart, having outlawed them after <b>refusing</b> Wal-Mart's proposed <b>store</b> {{on the edge}} of the city.|$|R
50|$|Because the States of Holland and West Friesland {{knew that}} the Spanish army might attempt to conquer Breda, they left the city with enough food, supplies, and weapons for an eight-month siege. The city council <b>refused</b> to <b>store</b> more food than was {{necessary}} for a nine-month siege. Nobody knew what tactics the Spanish army would apply. Therefore, {{the possibility of a}} direct assault was also considered. To prevent this, a State army was stationed near Breda with the aim of disrupting any direct assault on the city.|$|R
5000|$|Arnold {{then began}} {{preparing}} {{to evacuate the}} American garrison from Montreal. Pursuant to instructions from the Congressmen he began seizing supplies from local merchants, issuing receipts for the goods that the merchants could use in compensation claims later. These goods, which were marked to identify they supplying merchant, were shipped to Fort Chambly in early June. [...] Hazen, who owned property {{in the area and}} was in command at Chambly, <b>refused</b> to <b>store</b> the goods, believing them to be goods seized improperly from merchants he knew.|$|R
50|$|Although {{released}} as a single, {{the lyrics of}} the track Nazis 1994 were deemed so controversial that it was banned by UK commercial radio stations. Additionally, it was banned from being advertised and many record <b>stores</b> <b>refused</b> to stock the single. Ironically, the publicity aided in the album's success.|$|R

50|$|Before its release, <b>stores</b> <b>refused</b> to {{sell the}} band's debut self-titled album because of {{trademark}} issues. As a result, only 1,000 copies were made with the controversial cover, and later copies were made with an alternative cover. The one thousand original copies were sold exclusively through the band and Eyeball Records.|$|R
50|$|Kult is a horror-themed {{game and}} was first {{released}} in 1991. The setting {{was inspired by}} Gnostic philosophy and horror films such as Hellraiser. The violent horror themes of the game made it subject of controversy in Sweden on multiple occasions. This resulted in Swedish toy <b>stores</b> <b>refusing</b> to sell the game.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the application of delaytolerant networks to personal wireless communications. In these networks, selfish nodes can exploit the services provided by other nodes by downloading messages that interest them, but <b>refusing</b> to <b>store</b> and distribute messages {{for the benefit of}} other nodes. We propose a mechanism to discourage selfish behavior based on the principles of barter. We develop a game-theoretic model in which we show that the proposed approach indeed stimulates cooperation of the nodes. In addition, the results show that the individually most beneficial behavior leads to the social optimum of the system. ...|$|R

We propose a mechanism to discourage selfish behavior based on the principles of barter. We develop a game-theoretic model in which we show that the proposed approach indeed stimulates cooperation of the nodes. The results show that, in practical scenarios, the message delivery rate considerably increases, if the mobile nodes follow the Nash Equilibrium strategy in the proposed mechanism compared to the data dissemination protocol when no encouraging mechanism is present...|$|R
50|$|The cover (based on a photo by Jean Baptiste Mondino) {{caused some}} {{controversy}} upon release as it depicts Prince in the nude. Some record <b>stores</b> <b>refused</b> to stock it or wrapped the album in black; ironically, Lovesexy was issued {{as a replacement}} for the hastily withdrawn The Black Album, which had an achromatic black cover.|$|R
5000|$|The book reached {{number four}} on The New York Times {{paperback}} fiction best seller list in October 1990, though some US book <b>stores</b> <b>refused</b> to stock it {{due to the}} graphic content. It {{was published in the}} UK by Penguin Books in November 1990. Entertainment Weekly said it was [...] "gratifyingly faithful to the spirit of Peaks." ...|$|R
25|$|An angry mob of {{soldiers}} burned down the store-courthouse in 1850, destroying all county records. The melee apparently started when County Clerk John M. Hunter, who also owned the <b>store,</b> <b>refused</b> to sell whiskey to a soldier. Words were exchanged, and Hunter stabbed the soldier; about 50 soldiers stormed and burned the store, destroying all contents. Soldiers prevented townspeople from saving the county records.|$|R
50|$|The single {{was pulled}} {{during the second}} week of release, as some record <b>stores</b> <b>refused</b> to stock it. The song also made a one-week {{appearance}} on the Billboard Hot 100 upon No Line on the Horizons release, peaking at #79. It was added to A-Lists of BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 2, along with being added to XFMs playlist and the B-List of BBC 6 Music.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] {{shouted the}} {{messenger}} insolently, [...] "then Jana declares war upon you, {{the last war}} of all, war till every one of your men be dead and the Child you worship is burnt to grey ashes with fire. War till your women are taken as slaves and the corn which you <b>refuse</b> is <b>stored</b> in our grain pits and your land is a waste and your name forgotten. Already the hosts of Jana are gathered and the trumpet of Jana calls them to the fight. To-morrow {{or the next day}} they advance upon you, and ere the moon is full not one of you will be left to look upon her." ...|$|R
50|$|On May 9, 2014, {{the company}} {{reported}} that creditors had prevented it from carrying out those closures, despite many markets being so saturated with stores that the chain was effectively competing against itself. All secured lenders needed to approve the plan and Salus (a division of Harbinger Group) had <b>refused,</b> presuming fewer <b>stores</b> would mean fewer assets to secure the loan, reducing any recovery it would get in a bankruptcy reorganization.|$|R
5000|$|The {{pants were}} sold through Noko Jeans' online store, {{as well as}} the Noko Jeans Museum in Stockholm. The Noko Jeans Museum was opened in Stockholm, Sweden December 5, 2009, when the PUB {{department}} <b>store</b> <b>refused</b> to continue selling the Oke and Kara jeans, worried that they would become involved in the current public debate regarding the ethics of selling clothes produced in the country of North Korea ...|$|R
50|$|Like {{many other}} Illinois {{communities}} {{in the aftermath of}} World War II, Alton openly flouted state law by maintaining segregated public schools below the high school level. African-Americans who wanted to watch a movie at the old Grand Theater were relegated to seats in the balcony. Downtown <b>stores</b> <b>refused</b> to allow blacks to try on clothes before purchasing them. Black families could not dine at the lunch counter of Kresge's Variety Store.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of its release, the band was already {{extremely}} controversial, having sworn on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from playing live in most parts of England. The album's title added to that controversy, with some people finding the word [...] "bollocks" [...] offensive. Many record <b>stores</b> <b>refused</b> to carry the album and some record charts refused to list the album, showing just a blank space instead.|$|R
50|$|Fort Martin Scott was {{established}} in 1848 at Barons Creek, a Pedernales tributary.An angry mob of soldiers burned down the store-courthouse in 1850, destroying all county records.

50|$|In November 2009, {{a lawsuit}} against B&H Photo alleged that the <b>store</b> <b>refused</b> to hire women, in {{violation}} of New York City and New York State Human Rights Laws. The lawsuit, brought by four women, sought class action status {{on behalf of all}} women discriminated against by B&H over the course of many years. Given B&H's prior alleged discriminatory practices, the lawsuit sought US$19 million in compensatory and punitive damages in order to deter future discriminatory practices.|$|R
5000|$|Many record <b>stores</b> <b>refused</b> to sell albums {{containing}} the label (most notably Wal-Mart), and others limited sales of those albums to adults. One of the albums {{to receive the}} [...] "Parental Advisory" [...] sticker was Frank Zappa's Grammy-winning album Jazz from Hell, presumably {{for the use of}} the word [...] "Hell" [...] in its title but also for the song [...] "G-Spot Tornado", even though it is a collection of instrumental pieces and contains no lyrics at all.|$|R
50|$|The album's {{controversial}} cover features 3 {{pieces of}} ripped paper featuring Al Capone {{on the first}} piece with a tommy gun trying to break a door with his right foot. The second piece features an empty liquor bottle held in a drunk woman's hand. The final piece features Marilyn Monroe putting on thigh high stockings. The pictures are drawn all in blue on a gray background. Many chain <b>stores</b> <b>refused</b> to sell the album in their stores because of the cover.|$|R
40|$|Solid-waste {{treatment}} in space for Advanced Life Support, ALS, applications {{requires that the}} material can be safely processed and stored in a confined environment. Many solid-wastes are not stable because they are wet (40 - 90 % moisture) and contain levels of soluble organic compounds that {{can contribute to the}} growth of undesirable microorganisms with concomitant production of noxious odors. In the absence of integrated Advanced Life Support systems on orbit, permanent gas, trace volatile organic and microbiological analyses were performed on crew refuse returned from the volume F "wet" trash of three consecutive Shuttle missions (STS- 105, 109, and 110). These analyses were designed to characterize the short-term biological stability of the material and assess potential crew risks resulting from microbial decay processes during storage. Waste samples were collected post-orbiter landing and sorted into packaging material, food waste, toilet waste, and bulk liquid fractions deposited during flight in the volume F container. Aerobic and anaerobic microbial loads were determined in each fraction by cultivation on R 2 A and by acridine orange direct count (AODC). Dry and ash weights were performed to determine both water and organic content of the materials. Experiments to determine the aerobic and anaerobic biostability of <b>refuse</b> <b>stored</b> for varying periods of time were performed by on-line monitoring of CO 2 and laboratory analysis for production of hydrogen sulfide and methane. Volatile organic compounds and permanent gases were analyzed using EPA Method TO 15 by USEPA et al. [EPA Method TO 15, The Determination of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in Ambient Air using SUMMA, Passivated Canister Sampling and Gas Chromatographic Analysis, 1999] with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and by gas chromatography with selective detectors. These baseline measures of waste stream content, labile organics, and microbial load in the volume F Shuttle trash provide data for waste subsystem analysis and atmospheric management within the ALS Project.

50|$|Unlike a {{disaster}} relief scenario, {{the needs of}} a charity shop are long-term and more flexible; any item that can be sold at a price higher than the cost of warehousing it could be worthwhile. Large non-profits, such as Goodwill Industries, are also able to make use of items that cannot be sold in their thrift stores, for example by bundling them and selling them as bulk material or scrap. These <b>stores</b> <b>refuse</b> donations that cost money to dispose of safely if unwanted, such as e-waste.|$|R
5|$|In 1982, {{shortly after}} The Texas Chain Saw Massacre {{established}} {{itself as a}} success on US home video, Wizard Video released a mass-market video game adaptation for the Atari 2600. In the game, the player assumes the role of Leatherface and attempts to murder trespassers while avoiding obstacles such as fences and cow skulls. As {{one of the first}} horror-themed video games, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre caused controversy when it was first released due to its violent nature; it sold poorly as a result, because many game <b>stores</b> <b>refused</b> to stock it.|$|R
50|$|Amidst {{the end of}} the ska boom of the mid-1990s, sales {{began to}} drop and many records were {{returned}} to the small label. Several distribution companies were filing bankruptcy while owing Moon Ska thousands of dollars in unpaid invoices, for albums that were already sent to stores. Those same record <b>stores</b> <b>refused</b> to keep the album prices in the suggested $10 range, and instead marked them up to between $17 and $19. All of these factors led to {{the end of the}} Moon Ska store, and eventually, the label itself.|$|R
50|$|In 2001, the Wenham Lake Watershed Association {{discovered}} significant {{contamination of}} the lake with large deposits of fly ash dating from the 1950s and 1960s. These deposits totalled about 7,800 cubic yards and were more than 3 feet deep in some places. The origin of the fly ash was the nearby Vitale dump. The dump was an abandoned gravel and sand quarry that had illegally <b>stored</b> <b>refuse</b> from coal burned at the Salem Harbor Power Generating Station. In subsequent years the lake has been dredged and is monitored for its long-term health.|$|R

50|$|On 17 July 2007, {{she made}} a first in the Malaysian music scene by being the first artiste to hold a web concert. In September, she {{announced}} her plan to produce a Mandarin album (and her Chinese stage name, as stated above). The album, titled Showtime, which has since been finished and scheduled for release on 27 October, however, hit a snag when {{it was found that}} retail <b>stores</b> <b>refuse</b> to distribute or sell the album. This lead her company to only sell her album in a 50-leg promotional tour around the country.|$|R
50|$|Dead Kennedys' lyrics {{were usually}} {{political}} in nature, satirizing establishment political figures (both liberal and conservative) and authority in general, {{as well as}} popular culture and even the punk movement itself. During their initial incarnation between 1978 and 1986, they attracted considerable controversy for their provocative lyrics and artwork. Several <b>stores</b> <b>refused</b> to stock their recordings, provoking debate about censorship in rock music; in the mid 1980s, vocalist and primary lyricist Jello Biafra became an active campaigner against the Parents Music Resource Center. This culminated in an obscenity trial between 1985 and 1986, {{which resulted in a}} hung jury.|$|R
50|$|The Naples Archeological District is {{an archaeological}} {{district}} {{located on the}} east bank of the Illinois River at Naples, Illinois. The district includes sixteen archaeological sites which were primarily occupied during the Woodland period. The area was most active during the Middle Woodland period, when it served as an important trade site in the Hopewell exchange system. Over a dozen mounds {{are included in the}} district; these mounds mainly served as burial sites, though a number were used to <b>store</b> <b>refuse.</b> The area also includes several large village sites, as Naples was a habitation site in addition to a trade center.|$|R
50|$|The protest was {{organized}} after {{an incident in}} which the Korean owner of the convenience <b>store</b> <b>refused</b> to waive a $5 minimum charge for debit card transactions for the African-American leader of the local Nation of Islam chapter, Jeffrey Muhammad, which was allegedly followed by an exchange of racial epithets between the two men. The South Korean consul general from Houston was dispatched {{in an attempt to}} resolve the issue. In 2010, a Korean employee of the store shot and killed Marcus Phillips, a 26-year-old African-American who appeared to be attempting to steal the cash register.|$|R
5000|$|In July 1997, they {{released}} their debut album ¿Dónde Jugarán las Niñas?, which took its name partly from Maná's album ¿Dónde Jugarán los Niños? generating controversy with <b>stores</b> <b>refusing</b> {{to sell it}} because of its lyrics and cover. Molotov {{went out to the}} street to sell their discs as a form of protest. The lyrics include a mixture of politics, sex and expletives, which made it hard for Molotov to enter mainstream media. In 1998, they participated with the song [...] "Payaso" [...] in the album Volcán: Tributo a José José a tribute to legendary singer José José.|$|R
