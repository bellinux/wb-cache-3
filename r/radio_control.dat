5|$|On 7 April, Utah left Norfolk for {{sea trials}} to train her engine room crew and {{to test the}} {{radio-control}} equipment. The ship could be controlled at varying rates of speed and changes of course: maneuvers that a ship would conduct in battle. Her electric motors, operated by signals from the controlling ship, opened and closed throttle valves, moved her steering gear, and regulated the supply of oil to her boilers. In addition, a Sperry gyro pilot kept the ship on course. She passed her <b>radio</b> <b>control</b> trials on 6 May, and on 1 June, the ship was operated for 3 hours under <b>radio</b> <b>control.</b> On 9 June, she again left Norfolk, bound for San Pedro, California, where she joined Training Squadron 1, Base Force, United States Fleet. Starting in late July, the ship began her first round of target duty, first for the cruisers of the Pacific Fleet, and then for the battleship Nevada. She continued in this role for the next nine years; she participated in Fleet Problem XVI in May 1935, during which she served as a transport for a contingent of Marines. In June, the ship was modified to train anti-aircraft gunners {{in addition to her}} target ship duties. To perform this task, she was equipped with a new /75 caliber anti-aircraft gun in a quadruple mount for experimental testing and development of the new type of weapon.|$|E
5|$|In Return of the Jedi, Jabba {{is portrayed}} by a one-ton puppet that took {{three months and}} {{half a million dollars}} to construct. While filming the movie, the puppet had its own makeup artist. The puppet {{required}} three puppeteers to operate, {{making it one of the}} largest ever used in a motion picture. Stuart Freeborn designed the puppet, while John Coppinger sculpted its latex, clay, and foam pieces. Puppeteers included David Alan Barclay, Toby Philpott, and Mike Edmonds, who were members of Jim Henson's Muppet group. Barclay operated the right arm and mouth and read the character's English dialogue, while Philpott controlled the left arm, head, and tongue. Edmonds, the shortest of the three men (he also played the Ewok Logray in later scenes) was responsible for the movement of Jabba's tail. Tony Cox, who also played an Ewok, would assist as well. The eyes and facial expressions were operated by <b>radio</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
5|$|She was {{modified}} at Chatham Dockyard {{for use as}} a target ship between 6 December 1920 and 8 April 1921. The ship was rewired for <b>radio</b> <b>control</b> and stripped; the 12-inch turrets remained aboard, but all of her guns and their equipment were removed, as were her torpedo equipment, flying deck, sea cabins, main derrick and boat equipment, lower conning tower, masts and yards, most of her crew amenities, and other unnecessary equipment. Unnecessary hatches, coamings, scuttles, and lifts were removed and plated over, and she was ballasted differently than she had been as a battleship. It was not intended to sink her, so she was assigned a crew of 153 to maintain and operate her when she was not under fire.|$|E

The first look at a Hasbro action figure of the film's version of Spider-Man was revealed at the July 2011 Comic-Con. Hasbro made a <b>radio</b> <b>control</b> speed-climbing figure. Minimates made action figures from the film. Other companies releasing action figures for the film include Hot Toys, MediCom and Kaiyodo. OPI Products released a collection of The Amazing Spider-Man nail polish. Trading cards were also available.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the RP-77D made {{extensive}} use of glass-polyester plastic materials. The drone was launched using a rocket-assisted take-off system consisting of four Loki rockets, and was fitted with a <b>radio</b> <b>control</b> apparatus that, {{with the assistance of}} radar tracking, allowed the drone to be operated at a considerable distance from its launching point. In addition to equipment typically carried by target drones, the RP-77D could be equipped with reconnaissance or meteorological sensors, or with air sampling equipment. The RP-77D utilised the RPTA tracking system, developed by Radioplane, using audio frequency tones for control. Tip tanks allowed for carriage of additional fuel to extend the aircraft's range, and recovery {{at the end of the}} flight was by parachute.|$|E
5|$|MacLachlan did {{not take}} to his new posting and was eager {{to get back to}} the action. MacLachlan volunteered for service with RAF Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain which had begun in July 1940. He learned on the 18 August that he had been one of five pilots chosen from 88 Squadron to retrain as fighter pilots. He was posted to RAF Drem for {{training}} with No. 145 Squadron. He flew a Hawker Hurricane fighter for the first time days later on 22 August. Within nine days he had logged 18 hours in the type. On 3 September he was given official leave to travel to London. There he received his DFC at Buckingham Palace. He returned to No. 145 shortly afterwards and was based at RAF Tangmere, Croydon and Westhampnett. No. 11 Group RAF was in the thick of the fighting and suffered many casualties. MacLachlan and his group were to replace the many pilots killed or wounded. MacLachlan practiced operational take-offs, fighter tactics, <b>radio</b> <b>control,</b> break-aways and dogfights—the essence of air-to-air combat. He was sent on patrols on 30 August, but only over Scotland, to guard against attacks from Luftflotte 5 (Air Fleet 5) based in Norway. No interceptions were made as air combat was rare in the north. On 21 September MacLachlan survived a force-landing at Dyce, caused by an oil leak. On 27 September 1940 MacLachlan was posted to the south at Debden, arriving two days later. He was then assigned to No. 73 Squadron RAF at RAF Castle Camps.|$|E

50|$|One common {{style of}} {{radio-controlled}} clock uses time signals transmitted by dedicated terrestrial longwave radio transmitters, which emit a time code {{that can be}} demodulated and displayed by the <b>radio</b> <b>controlled</b> clock. The <b>radio</b> <b>controlled</b> clock will contain an accurate time base oscillator to maintain timekeeping if the radio signal is momentarily unavailable. Other <b>radio</b> <b>controlled</b> clocks use the time signals transmitted by dedicated transmitters in the shortwave bands. Systems using dedicated time signal stations can achieve accuracy of a few tens of milliseconds.|$|R

25|$|A {{remote control}} is an {{electronic}} device used to operate any machine, {{such as a}} television, remotely. Many of these remotes communicate to their respective devices through infrared signals and <b>radio</b> <b>control.</b> In Madison Square Garden, at the Electrical Exhibition, Nikola Tesla gave the first demonstration of a boat propelling in water, controlled by his remote control which he designed using radio signals.

25|$|In September 1918, the Commander-in-Chief, Grand Fleet, Admiral David Beatty, {{called for}} a large target to be {{provided}} which would allow the battleships of the Grand Fleet, which had seen little action since the Battle of Jutland in 1916, realistic gunnery practice. To meet this requirement, {{it was suggested that}} Hibernia be converted to <b>radio</b> <b>control</b> and undergo other modifications so that she could assume duty as a target ship, but ultimately the predreadnought battleship HMS Agamemnon became available and was selected instead.|$|E

25|$|The {{hands and}} facial {{features}} of the groundbreaking animatronic puppets in the film were controlled with relatively primitive rods and cables, although <b>radio</b> <b>control</b> later took over many of the subtler movements. Human performers inside the puppets supplied basic movement for the larger creatures, which in some cases was dangerous or exhausting; for example, the Garthim costumes were so heavy that the performers had to be hung up on a rack every few minutes to rest while still inside the costumes. A mime from Switzerland was hired to help choreograph {{the movements of the}} puppeteers.|$|E
25|$|Between films, Denny overheard {{a racket}} {{next door and}} went to investigate.

While attempting to get it fixed, Denny became acquainted with the newly forming model industry, one of whom convinced him to take it up as a hobby. In 1934 he started a small hobby shop with a partner on Hollywood Boulevard, but after two years it went out of business.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of German jet-powered bombers late in 1944 {{led to a}} re-evaluation of this policy, and on 26 January 1945 the Army Chief of Ordnance issued a requirement for a new guided missile weapon system. Like the German efforts, the Army designs quickly fell into two groups, high-speed line-of-sight weapons for short ranges, and airplane-like systems that flew at lower speeds but offered longer range. Eventually two such programs were selected; Bell Labs, a world leader in radar, <b>radio</b> <b>control</b> and automated aiming systems (see Hendrik Wade Bode) won the contract for a short-range weapon known as Project Nike. Boeing led development of an aircraft-like longer range system, GAPA, designated project MX-606.|$|E

25|$|Since 2001, {{expanded}} polypropylene (EPP) foams {{have been}} gaining in popularity and in application as a structural material in hobbyist <b>radio</b> <b>control</b> model aircraft. Unlike expanded polystyrene foam (EPS) which is friable and breaks easily on impact, EPP foam {{is able to}} absorb kinetic impacts very well without breaking, retains its original shape, and exhibits memory form characteristics which allow it to return to its original shape in {{a short amount of}} time. In consequence, a radio-control model whose wings and fuselage are constructed from EPP foam is extremely resilient, and able to absorb impacts that would result in complete destruction of models made from lighter traditional materials, such as balsa or even EPS foams.|$|E
25|$|The Radioplane Company was an American {{aviation}} company which produced drone aircraft primarily {{for use as}} gunnery targets. During World War II they produced over 9,400 of their Radioplane OQ-3 model, a propeller-powered monoplane, making it the most-used target aircraft in the US. In the post-World War II era they introduced their Radioplane BTT series, which was produced for years and eventually reached almost 60,000 examples. They also produced several <b>radio</b> <b>control</b> and self-guided missiles, the largest being the GAM-67 Crossbow, which didn't enter service. The company was purchased by Northrop Corporation in 1952, and moved to one of Northrop's factories in 1962. One of the last projects carried out at the original Radioplane factory in Van Nuys, California, was {{the construction of the}} Gemini Paraglider.|$|E
25|$|The Technician license, {{newly created}} in the 1951 {{structure}} decision, was awarded to applicants who passed the General Class theory test, known as Element 3, but only required a 5 WPM code proficiency. It was initially intended for <b>radio</b> <b>control</b> of model aircraft, etc. but at that time, usage of the band for such a purpose was rare. Technicians were granted all General Class privileges in the 50MHz band and all bands above 220MHz; on 2 meters they were limited to 145–147MHz. An applicant was permitted to apply for and hold both Technician and Novice licenses simultaneously (for the first year). In the 1950s and until the late 1960s, a US ham could hold both Technician and Novice licenses at the same time, thus having two callsigns (WN 2x3 for the Novice and a WA or WB 2x3 for Technician).|$|E
