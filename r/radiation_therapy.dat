5000|$|Administration of S1P {{has been}} shown to protect oocytes from {{chemotherapeutic}} agents in vitro, as well as in vivo from chemotherapeutic and <b>radiation</b> <b>therapies.</b> which otherwise induce apoptosis of the cells. S1P has protected ovarian tissue xenografts in SCID mouse models from radiation induced atresia. [...] In animal models these protected oocytes have been used to produce healthy live young. [...] Radiotherapies and chemotherapies can cause apoptosis of ovarian follicles, causing premature ovarian failure, and so S1P is of great interest in fertility preservation. However, its mechanism of inhibiting the sphingomyelin apoptotic pathway may also interfere with the apoptosis action of chemotherapy drugs.|$|R
5|$|When {{the lesion}} is localized, it is {{generally}} curable. However, long-term survival for children with advanced disease older than 18 months of age is poor despite aggressive multimodal therapy (intensive chemotherapy, surgery, <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy,</b> stem cell transplant, differentiation agent isotretinoin also called 13-cis-retinoic acid, and frequently immunotherapy with anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody therapy).|$|E
5|$|Carson and {{the others}} {{involved}} with publication of Silent Spring expected fierce criticism. They were particularly concerned {{about the possibility of}} being sued for libel. Carson was also undergoing <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> to combat her spreading cancer, and expected to have little energy to devote to defending her work and responding to critics. In preparation for the anticipated attacks, Carson and her agent attempted to amass as many prominent supporters as possible before the book's release.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{considered}} to be an incurable and rapidly lethal cancer unless both the primary tumor and any metastases can be fully removed by surgery. No potentially curative treatment exists except surgery, but most people have advanced stage disease at presentation and are inoperable at the time of diagnosis. People with cholangiocarcinoma are generally managed - though not cured - with chemotherapy, <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy,</b> and other palliative care measures. These are also used as additional therapies after surgery in cases where resection has apparently been successful (or nearly so).|$|E
50|$|Further {{prophylactic}} and therapeutic strategies include pressure therapy, silicone gel sheeting, intra-lesional triamcinolone acetonide (TAC), cryosurgery, <b>radiation,</b> laser <b>therapy,</b> IFN, 5-FU and surgical excision {{as well as}} a multitude of extracts and topical agents.|$|R
40|$|Basal cell {{carcinoma}} (BCC), when untreated, causes signifi-cant morbidity and mortality. Challenging tumors are regu-larly reviewed in multimodality tumor boards and are classi-fied not by metastatic risk (inherently very low) but by histologic type and other tu-mor characteristics. Tumors are thus triaged appropriately to destruction, excision, topi-cal therapy,Mohs surgery, or ionizing <b>radiation</b> <b>therapies.</b> The cure rate for BCCwithmonotherapyhas largely exceeded that for other human cancers, prompting some {{to lose sight}} of the tremendous challenge it still creates. 1 The increasing number of these cancers and the increasing longevityofpatients leaves us with more complex BCC tumors to manage.

5|$|Hemorrhagic cystitis, {{characterized}} by {{blood in the}} urine, can occur secondary {{to a number of}} causes including: infections, <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy,</b> underlying cancer, medications and toxins. Medications that commonly cause this problem include the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide with rates of 2 to 40%. Eosinophilic cystitis is a rare condition where eosinophiles are present in the bladder wall. Signs and symptoms are similar to a bladder infection. Its cause is not entirely clear; however, it may be linked to food allergies, infections, and medications among others.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Reines took {{most of his}} {{neutrino}} {{research team}} {{with him when he}} left for the new University of California, Irvine (UCI), becoming its first dean of physical sciences.

5|$|Linear {{particle}} accelerators generate electron beams {{for treatment of}} superficial tumors in <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy.</b> Electron therapy can treat such skin lesions as basal-cell carcinomas because an electron beam only penetrates to a limited depth before being absorbed, typically up to 5cm for electron energies in the range 5–20MeV. An electron beam {{can be used to}} supplement the treatment of areas that have been irradiated by X-rays.|$|E
30|$|The “dandelion” {{hypothesis}} was tested by Li et al. in {{a breast cancer}} model. Cells were taken from patients with HER 2 + breast cancer before and after treatment with lapatinib. Following chemotherapy, the percentage of CD 44 High/CD 24 Low cells increased. These cells, with a molecular signature consistent with breast CSCs, were able to self-renew and had a propensity for tumor formation [70]. CD 44 High/CD 24 Low breast CSCs appear to also show resistance to conventional <b>radiation</b> <b>therapies</b> [71]. The implication of these data are two-fold. First, chemotherapy and radiotherapy appear to select for the survival CSCs. Second, chemotherapy and radiotherapy do not impair the ability of CSCs to grow and replicate.|$|R
40|$|Pancreatic {{adenocarcinoma}} {{is characterized}} by poor prognosis, because of late diagnosis and lack of response to chemo- and/or <b>radiation</b> <b>therapies.</b> Resistance to apoptosis mainly causes this insensitivity to conventional therapies. Apoptosis or programmed cell death is a central regulator of tissue homeostasis. Certain genetic disturbances of apoptotic signaling pathways {{have been found in}} carcinomas leading to tumor development and progression. In the past few years, the knowledge about the complex pathways of apoptosis has strongly increased and new therapeutic approaches based on this knowledge are being developed. This review will focus on the role of apoptotic proteins contributing to pancreatic cancer development and progression and will demonstrate possible targets to influence this deadly disease...|$|R
40|$|Lung cancers remain one of {{the most}} common and deadly cancers in the world today (12. 5 % of newly {{diagnosed}} cancers) despite current advances in chemo- and <b>radiation</b> <b>therapies.</b> Often, by the time these tumors are diagnosed, they have already metastasized. These tumors demonstrate the classic hallmarks of cancer in that they have advanced defensive strategies allowing them to escape various standard oncological treatments. Immunotherapy is making inroads towards effectively treating other fatal cancers, such as melanoma, glioblastoma multiforme, and castrate-resistant prostate cancers. This paper will cover the escape mechanisms of bronchogenic lung cancer that must be overcome before they can be successfully treated. We also review the history of immunotherapy directed towards lung cancers...|$|R
