5|$|If the {{concentration}} of the inert gas in the breathing gas is reduced below that {{of any of the}} tissues, there is a tendency for gas to <b>return</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tissues to the breathing gas. This is known as out-gassing, and occurs during decompression, when the reduction in ambient pressure reduces the partial pressure of the inert gas in the lungs. This process may be complicated by the formation of gas bubbles, and the modeling is more complex and varied.|$|E
5|$|The {{competition}} {{follows a}} point scoring system {{much like the}} Amsterdam Tournament, whereby each team plays two matches, with three points awarded for a win, one point for a draw and none for a loss. An additional point is awarded for every goal scored; this was scrapped in 2011, but made a <b>return</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 2013 edition. From 2009, total shots on target throughout the tournament {{has been used as}} a tiebreaker if teams are tied on points, goal difference and goals scored.|$|E

5|$|A {{second season}} of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. was ordered in May 2014, and {{production}} began that July.

Several other characters from MCU films and Marvel One-Shots also appear throughout the season. Some episodes directly crossover with the television series Agent Carter and the film , while {{the introduction of the}} Inhumans sets up the planned film of the same name and creates connections to the film Guardians of the Galaxy.|$|E

5|$|After Vali's death, Sugriva acquires Vali's kingdom {{as well as}} Tara. The Ramayana {{does not}} record any formal {{marriage}} or any ritual purification—like the trial by fire Sita had to undergo when she is reacquired by Rama from Ravana—that Tara must undertake to marry Sugriva or return to Vali following his <b>return</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dead. The lack of the description of formal marriage suggests, according to some critics, that Tara's relationship to Sugriva is neither widow re-marriage nor polyandry, but simply appropriation by Sugriva. In the references of the coronation of Sugriva as king, Angada is also described as the heir-apparent crown prince, while Tara is mentioned as Sugriva's wife. The Adhyatma Ramayana declares that Sugriva acquires Tara.|$|E
5|$|After the war Wiśniowiecki {{engaged in}} a number of {{conflicts}} with neighbouring magnates and nobles. Jeremi was able to afford a sizable private army of several thousands, and through the threat of it he was often able to force his neighbours to a favourable settlement of disputes. Soon after his <b>return</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Russian front, he participated {{on the side of the}} Dowmont family in the quarrel over the estate of Dowmontów against another magnate, Samuel Łaszcz, located on his lands; soon after the victorious battle against Łaszcz he bought the lands from the Dowmonts and incorporated them into his estates.|$|E
5|$|Among the Romani people, mullo (literally {{one who is}} dead) are {{believed}} to <b>return</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dead and cause malicious acts as well as drink human blood, most often that of a relative or {{the person who had}} caused their death. Other potential victims were those who did not properly observe the burial ceremonies or kept the deceased's possessions instead of properly destroying them. Female vampires could return, lead a normal life and even marry but would eventually exhaust the husband with their sexual appetite. Similar to other European beliefs, male vampires could father children, known as dhampirs, who could be hired to detect and get rid of vampires.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the works}} created {{during the war}} was Yakov Knyazhnin's tragedy Olga (1772). The Russian playwright chose to {{introduce}} Sviatoslav as his protagonist, although his active participation in the events following Igor's death is {{out of sync with}} the traditional chronology. Knyazhnin's rival Nikolai Nikolev (1758–1815) also wrote a play on the subject of Sviatoslav's life. Ivan Akimov's painting Sviatoslav's <b>Return</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Danube to Kiev (1773) explores the conflict between military honour and family attachment. It is a vivid example of Poussinesque rendering of early medieval subject matter.|$|E
5|$|An {{extensive}} {{project of}} castle-building was also initiated, {{under the direction}} of Master James of Saint George, a prestigious architect whom Edward had met in Savoy on his <b>return</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> crusade. These included the castles of Beaumaris, Caernarfon, Conwy and Harlech, intended to act both as fortresses and royal palaces for the King. His programme of castle building in Wales heralded the introduction of the widespread use of arrowslits in castle walls across Europe, drawing on Eastern influences. Also a product of the Crusades was the introduction of the concentric castle, and four of the eight castles Edward founded in Wales followed this design. The castles made a clear, imperial statement about Edward's intentions to rule North Wales permanently, and drew on imagery associated with the Byzantine Roman Empire and King Arthur in an attempt to build legitimacy for his new regime.|$|E
5|$|Balmer was {{promoted}} to temporary group captain on 4May 1944. On 10/11May, his Lancasters {{took part in a}} raid on Lille, losing three of their number. In an effort to shore up the morale of his younger crews, Balmer decided to personally lead their next mission the following night, against a military camp at Bourg-Léopold (Leopoldsburg), Belgium. It was planned to be his last operation before going on to a more senior position. His aircraft failed to <b>return</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> raid, causing considerable shock to his unit. The next day, Balmer's place as commanding officer of No.467 Squadron was taken by Wing Commander William Brill, previously a member of No.463 Squadron RAAF, which was also based at Waddington.|$|E
