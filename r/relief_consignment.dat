50|$|Many low-valued {{exports of}} goods from the Channel Islands to the United Kingdom were exempt from value added tax (VAT) until April 2012, due to the {{operation}} of an EU tax <b>relief</b> called low-value <b>consignment</b> <b>relief</b> (LVCR). LVCR {{was not limited to}} the Channel Islands, and continues to apply to all low-valued imports into the EU from other countries outside of the EU.|$|R
40|$|The {{changing}} nature of armed conflict has had a dramatic impact on the security risks facing humanitarian personnel. Historically, the safety of humanitarian aid delivery was secured through {{the consent of the}} relevant Parties to the conflict. However, non-international ethnically-motivated armed conflicts, failed and failing states, and insurgency-based warfare have fundamentally challenged the viability of this traditional security paradigm. In confronting today 2 ̆ 7 s complex security climate, humanitarian organizations are faced with a diverse menu of alternatives to enhance their security. The debate over armed protection that has sharply divided the humanitarian community is explored in this paper, including a critique of specific armed protection options. Tensions between the safe and efficient delivery of aid, and principles of impartiality, neutrality and independence are discussed. The implications of humanitarian organizations using private security companies for defensive armed protection have been relatively unexplored, particularly with respect to international humanitarian law. This paper aims to address this shortcoming by considering two threshold questions: is the protected status of humanitarian personnel under international humanitarian law suspended or lost if they use armed private security contractors; and, is humanitarian access to provide relief legally affected by the decision to hire a private security company for armed protection of <b>relief</b> <b>consignments...</b>|$|R
50|$|It was {{announced}} on 4 October 2012 that Condor Logistics would close its operations {{with the loss}} of about 180 jobs (110 in the UK, 50 in Jersey and 20 in Guernsey). The move was blamed on changes to low-value <b>consignment</b> <b>relief</b> affecting the Channel Islands.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} online retailers, and {{fulfillment}} houses operate from the Channel Islands, including Jersey, supplying {{a variety of}} low-value goods such as CDs, DVDs, video games, and gadgets. Residents of the EU were choosing to order goods from Jersey, so as to benefit from a tax relief known as Low-value <b>consignment</b> <b>relief</b> (LVCR). UK residents, in particular, were taking advantage of this situation.|$|R
50|$|Value-added tax is an EU tax {{adopted by}} the member states of the European Union. However {{as a result of}} the action of an EU {{administrative}} VAT relief an exception is an option allowed on shipments to the member state of a low value. This administrative relief is known as Low Value <b>Consignment</b> <b>Relief</b> or LVCR and it is governed by the EU Council Directive 2009/132/EC.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decades natural and {{man-made}} disasters have been increasing in terms of frequency, size, number of people affected and material damage caused. There is growing awareness {{of the importance of}} adequate national and international legal frameworks for disaster prevention, mitigation and response. The implementation of these frameworks, however, poses serious challenges. This book analyses International Disaster Response Law as developed in recent times and identifies the main existing normative gaps. The authors address the rights and duties of States in preventing and mitigating disasters, in facilitating access to their territory for humanitarian relief actors, as well as issues related to liability and compensation. Due attention is paid to European Union law governing disaster response (and to its reform {{in the light of the}} Lisbon Treaty) and to the main trends in domestic legislation. Human rights obligations are thoroughly examined and the potential relevance of international criminal law is assessed. Additional topics such as the status of relief personnel, the hindrances to the delivery of <b>relief</b> <b>consignments</b> by customs and excise administration, the use of civilian and military defence assets in emergency situations, the mechanisms and procedures available to offer financial support for recovery and rehabilitation, risk insurance, and the issue of corruption during disaster-related activities are specifically addressed. By drawing on the expertise of lawyers, political scientists, economists and humanitarian practitioners, the book promotes much-needed interdisciplinary dialog and sheds light on a largely uncharted field of research. It is therefore a essential reading for academics and practitioners in international and EU law, policy makers, civil protection and humanitarian operators and for anyone interested in exploring the legal facets of the international community’s response to large-scale calamitous events...|$|R
50|$|While the {{standard}} UK rate of Value Added Tax (VAT) of 20% is generally triple or more that of US sales taxes, differences in prices can be {{far greater than}} this could account for.. The Crown Dependencies of Jersey and Guernsey {{are not part of}} the EU and Low Value <b>Consignment</b> <b>Relief</b> applied to imports. Retailers such as Play.com and Specsavers operated from Jersey or Guernsey specifically as a means of avoiding VAT.|$|R
50|$|Goods {{imported}} from non-member states {{are subject to}} VAT at the rate applicable in the member state into which the goods are imported, {{regardless of whether the}} goods are received for consideration and regardless of who imports the goods. VAT is generally charged at the border, {{at the same time as}} customs duty and using the price determined by customs. However, as a result of the action of EU administrative VAT relief, an exception called Low Value <b>Consignment</b> <b>Relief</b> is allowed on shipments of a low value.|$|R
50|$|The Channel Islands have no {{say over}} the {{operation}} of Low Value <b>Consignment</b> <b>Relief</b> as they are not members of the EU and the relief is granted to the importer of the goods and not the exporter. However, the Channel Islands, whilst having no direct influence on the tax policies of the UK government, do regularly discuss taxation issues with the UK Treasury and HM Revenue and Customs as proven by the discussions {{that took place in}} 2006 regarding Jersey's new Fulfilment Industry Policy. Like all EU tax regimes, LVCR is ultimately policed by the EU.|$|R
50|$|When {{goods are}} {{imported}} into the EU from a non-EU territory, {{they are generally}} subject to a VAT (currently 20% in the UK for most goods). However, {{as a result of}} EU Council Directive 2009/132/EC, an optional exception is allowed on shipments of a low value to speed up the transit of low value goods which might otherwise be delayed by customs and also reduce the cost of tax collection where it might not be practicable. This administrative relief is known as low-value <b>consignment</b> <b>relief</b> (LVCR). Member states which allow the relief must ensure that it does not cause competitive distortion or allow VAT abuse.|$|R
5|$|Because {{value added}} tax (VAT) {{has not been}} levied in the island, luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France, {{providing}} an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries. The absence of VAT has also led {{to the growth of}} the fulfilment industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, lingerie and contact lenses are exported, avoiding VAT on arrival and thus undercutting local prices on the same products. In 2005, the States of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way. Low-value <b>consignment</b> <b>relief</b> provided the mechanism for VAT-free imports from the Channel Islands to the UK until 1 April 2012, at which time this policy of the UK government was binned.|$|R
50|$|Until 2012, the Low Value <b>Consignment</b> <b>Relief</b> (LVCR) {{meant that}} goods {{imported}} {{from outside the}} EU through Jersey and costing less than a set amount were not subject to VAT. When the LVCR was introduced in 1983 it was set at about £5 but gradually rose to £18. From 1 November 2011 the LVCR was reduced from £18 to £15. The LVCR allowed online retailers of DVDs and CDs to avoid VAT by importing the goods from the Channel Islands, which {{are not part of}} the EU. Major retailers involved in this tax avoidance included Amazon, Asda, HMV, Play.com, Tesco, W H Smith and Woolworths. The tax avoided each year due to LVCR was estimated to be £85m in 2005, £110m in 2008, £130m in 2010 and £140m in 2011. From 1 April 2012 the relief was withdrawn in respect of goods imported to the UK from the Channel Islands.|$|R
50|$|In January 2011, it was {{reported}} Coates was exploring the possibility of selling Healthspan for a price of around £150 million, with between 10 and 12 potential buyers submitting bids. Coates cited personal reasons related to a desire to reduce his workload, but stated that the existing management and workforce would not be affected. When four jobs were eliminated a week later, Healthspan denied that they were related to an impending sale, and were instead {{a result of the}} completed integration of Healthspan and Healthy Direct products. In 2011, the UK also announced it was ending the Low Value <b>Consignment</b> <b>Relief</b> (LVCR) loophole, which allowed retailers to avoid paying tax on goods exported from the Channel Islands to the UK that were under the value of £18. Healthspan challenged the decision, citing that countries located outside the EU, including Switzerland, Cyprus, Hong Kong, the USA and China, were not affected by the ruling. The company also announced that, following its legal challenge, it would begin exploring relocating its distribution operations, although its headquarters would remain in Guernsey.|$|R
