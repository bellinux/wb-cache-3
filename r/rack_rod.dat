40|$|Abstract: The uses of Acoustic Emission (AE) {{in process}} monitoring, {{particularly}} in the automotive sector, are little known but very varied (welding, straightening, drawing, machining, etc.) The most common use {{is no doubt in}} the straightening of gear box and steering <b>rack</b> <b>rods.</b> Tears or cracks may occur when tubes are formed or deep drawn. AE can be used to detect the point in the process where the crack occurs (in the case of multiple step processes or multi-station presses). Once this crucial point has been identified, it is then possible to adapt the production process or the metallurgy in order to prevent this damage from occurring. A press has been instrumented {{in order to be able}} to continuously control the production process. The first step when defining the feasibility of a process is performed using a multi-purpose AE system such as those used in research laboratories. Once the process has been clearly identified and the process noise has been characterized, a simplified control system is then defined and put in place on the production lines. Today, the mill decided to first study the localization of the weld seam before implemented the AE process monitoring. Introduction: During fabrication in the automotive industry, deep drawing operation of welded tubes is susceptible to produce cracks formation in the most strained area. The most common used one hundred percent non destructive testing method in visual inspection after swaging. This operation takes time. The customer risk is guarantee but no...|$|R
50|$|The Penobscot Salmon Club {{occupies}} a largely wooded 4 acre property {{north of downtown}} Brewer, roughly opposite the Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor. The site is located next to a shoals on the Penobscot River {{that has long been}} known for its productive fishing. The present clubhouse, built in 1923, is a rectangular single-story wood frame structure with a gable roof and wooden shingle siding. The entrance is at one of the gable ends, and a long covered porch extends along its water side. The interior of the building is open, with lockers and <b>racks</b> for fishing <b>rods.</b>|$|R
50|$|A rack is a toothed bar or rod {{that can}} be thought of as a sector gear with an {{infinitely}} large radius of curvature. Torque can be converted to linear force by meshing a rack with a pinion: the pinion turns; the rack moves in a straight line. Such a mechanism is used in automobiles to convert the rotation of the steering wheel into the left-to-right motion of the tie <b>rod(s).</b> <b>Racks</b> also feature in the theory of gear geometry, where, for instance, the tooth shape of an interchangeable set of gears may be specified for the rack, (infinite radius), and the tooth shapes for gears of particular actual radii are then derived from that. The rack and pinion gear type is employed in a rack railway.|$|R
40|$|According to specifications, {{lifetime}} of a linear stepping electromagnetic drive in WWER- 1000 nuclear reactors {{is limited by}} the pre-assigned lifetimes of the drive components such as electromagnets, a latch assembly, drive <b>rack,</b> and control <b>rod</b> position sensor. The {{lifetime of}} the drive components is from 7 to 20 years. On the basis of diagnostics of these components under real conditions, actual lifetimes of the components at nuclear power plant (NPP) were forecasted. It is shown that in order to extend the lifetime of the drive components up to the reactor lifetime (60 years), it is necessary to replace the sensor of the DPL-type by the new one (of the DPL-KV type) and to decrease the electromagnet temperature. The Measuring and Diagnostic System with the DPL-KV sensor enables diagnosing the sensor, electronic processing unit and drive. Economic effect due to the cumulative technical decisions is estimated to be 7 mln. euro per NPP unit...|$|R
40|$|Proposed as a {{baseline}} configuration, this rotary drill apparatus {{is designed to}} produce 100 -mm diameter holes in the lunar surface at depths up to 50 meters. The drill is intended to acquire samples for scientific analysis, mineral resource location, calibration of electronic exploration devices, and foundation analysis at construction sites. It is also intended to prepare holes for emplacement of scientific instruments, the setting of structural anchors, and explosive methods in excavation and mining activities. Defined as a deep drill because of the modular drill string, it incorporates an automatic rod changer. The apparatus is teleoperated from a remote location, such as earth, utilizing supervisory control techniques. It is thus suitable for unmanned and man-tended operation. Proven terrestrial drilling technology is used to the extent it {{is compatible with the}} lunar environment. Augers and drive tubes form holes in the regolith and may be used to acquire loose samples. An inertial cutting removal system operates intermittently while rock core drilling is in progress. The apparatus is carried to the work site by a three-legged mobile platform which also provides a 2 -meter feed along the hole centerline, an off-hole movement of approximately. 5 meters, an angular alignment of up to 20 deg. from gravity vertical, and other dexterity required in handling rods and samples. The technology can also be applied using other carriers which incorporate similar motion capabilities. The apparatus also includes storage <b>racks</b> for augers, <b>rods,</b> and ancillary devices such as the foot-plate that holds the down-hole tooling during rod changing operations...|$|R
5000|$|... "Fresh {{whole fish}} are usually sourced from Iceland, Faroe and Norway {{but can be}} sourced from other areas. Skilled filleters fillet the whole fish by hand. The {{filleted}} fish are then immersed in brine, for 10 to 15 minutes and then drained on metal <b>rod</b> <b>racks</b> known as speats {{at the end of}} the working day. The fish on the speats are put into the smokehouse chimneys at heights that suit the cold smoking process.The base of the smokehouse is laid with a covering of sawdust where 'fire' is introduced to start the sawdust smoldering. The rate at which the fish is smoked is dependent on the size of the fish, but also to a great degree by the ambient temperature and humidity. This means that in summer the sawdust needs the oxygen removed and only a small amount of 'fire' is needed to start the sawdust smoldering. In winter the sawdust needs less or no oxygen removed and more 'fire' is needed to start the sawdust smoldering. The fillets are left overnight for a minimum of 8 hours. Regular monitoring of the smoking process by skilled smokers is carried out to ensure the fish is smoked evenly, moving and removing fish when necessary. There is no heat involved, this is because the fish would start to cook during the smoking process and would start to flake and fall from the speats.The fish are then removed from the smokehouses and allowed to cool. Once cooled, they are packed into interleaved shallow purpose built cartons or in individual vacuum packs for transportation to a range of outlets both within the UK and abroad".|$|R
6000|$|In ancient times, as bards indite, (If clerks have conn'd {{the records}} right.) A peacock reign'd, whose glorious sway His {{subjects}} with delight obey: His tail was beauteous to behold, Replete with goodly eyes and gold; Fair emblem of that monarch's guise, Whose train at once is rich and wise; And princely ruled he many regions, And statesmen wise, and valiant legions. [...] A pheasant lord,[1] above the rest, With every grace and talent blest, Was sent to sway, {{with all his}} skill, The sceptre of a neighbouring hill.[2] No science was to him unknown, For all the arts were all his own: In all the living learned read, Though more delighted with the dead: For birds, if ancient tales say true, Had then their Popes and Homers too; Could read and write in prose and verse, And speak like ***, and build like Pearce.[3] He knew their voices, and their wings, Who smoothest soars, who sweetest sings; Who toils with ill-fledged pens to climb, And who attain'd the true sublime. Their merits he could well descry, He had so exquisite an eye; And when that fail'd to show them clear, He had as exquisite an ear; It chanced as on a day he stray'd Beneath an academic shade, He liked, amidst a thousand throats, The wildness of a Woodlark's[4] notes, And search'd, and spied, and seized his game, And took him home, and made him tame; Found him on trial true and able, So cheer'd and fed him at his table. [...] Here some shrewd critic finds I'm caught, And cries out, [...] "Better fed than taught"--Then jests on game and tame, and reads, And jests, and so my tale proceeds. [...] Long had he studied in the wood, Conversing with the wise and good: His soul with harmony inspired, With love of truth and virtue fired: His brethren's good and Maker's praise Were all the study of his lays; Were all his study in retreat, And now employ'd him with the great. His friendship was the sure resort Of all the wretched at the court; But chiefly merit in distress His greatest blessing was to bless.-- [...] This fix'd him in his patron's breast, But fired with envy all the rest: I mean that noisy, craving crew, Who round the court incessant flew, And prey'd like rooks, by pairs and dozens, To fill the maws of sons and cousins: [...] "Unmoved their heart, and chill'd their blood To every thought of common good, Confining every hope and care, To their own low, contracted sphere." [...] These ran him down with ceaseless cry, But {{found it hard to}} tell you why, Till his own worth and wit supplied Sufficient matter to deride: [...] "'Tis envy's safest, surest rule, To hide her rage in ridicule: The vulgar eye she best beguiles, When all her snakes are deck'd with smiles: Sardonic smiles, by rancour raised! Tormented most when seeming pleased!" [...] Their spite had more than half expired, Had he not wrote what all admired; What morsels had their malice wanted, But that he built, and plann'd, and planted! How had his sense and learning grieved them, But that his charity relieved them! [...] "At highest worth dull malice reaches, As slugs pollute the fairest peaches: Envy defames, as harpies vile Devour the food they first defile." [...] Now ask the fruit of all his favour-- [...] "He was not hitherto a saver."-- What then could make their rage run mad? [...] "Why, what he hoped, not what he had." [...] "What tyrant e'er invented ropes, Or <b>racks,</b> or <b>rods,</b> to punish hopes? Th' inheritance of hope and fame Is seldom Earthly Wisdom's aim; Or, if it were, is not so small, But there is room enough for all." [...] If he but chance to breathe a song, (He seldom sang, and never long,) The noisy, rude, malignant crowd, Where it was high, pronounced it loud: Plain Truth was Pride; and, what was sillier, Easy and Friendly was Familiar. [...] Or, if he tuned his lofty lays, With solemn air to Virtue's praise, Alike abusive and erroneous, They call'd it hoarse and inharmonious. Yet so it was to souls like theirs, Tuneless as Abel to the bears! [...] A Rook[5] with harsh malignant caw Began, was follow'd by a Daw;[6] (Though some, who would be thought to know, Are positive it was a crow:) Jack Daw was seconded by Tit, Tom Tit[7] could write, and so he writ; A tribe of tuneless praters follow, The Jay, the Magpie, and the Swallow; And twenty more their throats let loose, Down to the witless, waddling Goose. [...] Some peck'd at him, some flew, some flutter'd, Some hiss'd, some scream'd, and others mutter'd: The Crow, on carrion wont to feast, The Carrion Crow, condemn'd his taste: The Rook, in earnest too, not joking, Swore all his singing was but croaking. Some thought they meant to show their wit, Might think so still--"but that they writ"-- Could it be spite or envy?--"No-- Who did no ill could have no foe."-- So wise Simplicity esteem'd; Quite otherwise True Wisdom deem'd; This question rightly understood, [...] "What more provokes than doing good? A soul ennobled and refined Reproaches every baser mind: As strains exalted and melodious Make every meaner music odious."-- At length the Nightingale[8] was heard, For voice and wisdom long revered, Esteem'd of all the wise and good, The Guardian Genius of the wood: He long in discontent retired, Yet not obscured, but more admired: His brethren's servile souls disdaining, He lived indignant and complaining: They now afresh provoke his choler, (It seems the Lark had been his scholar, A favourite scholar always near him, And oft had waked whole nights to hear him.) Enraged he canvasses the matter, Exposes all their senseless chatter, Shows him and them in such a light, As more inflames, yet quells their spite. They hear his voice, and frighted fly, For rage had raised it very high: Shamed by the wisdom of his notes, They hide their heads, and hush their throats.|$|R
