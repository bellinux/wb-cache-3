Some {{of the effects}} created by Lazur would rely on software programming rather than the Nintendo 64 hardware, as the latter would not be capable of rendering them directly. The second mode would be a full 3D mode played in either <b>regular</b> <b>or</b> high display resolution, and would feature different level of detail textures depending on camera distances, to maximize clarity and performance. Both modes {{would be in a}} top-down perspective, although more cinematic camera angles, similar to those from , were also considered for the 3D mode.|$|E

These include slimes in different colors, bubble slimes, which look like pools of slime, nautical slimes that wear conch shells, the rare metal slimes, which have high defense, give out large amounts of experience points, and tend to flee from battle, healslimes, which have tentacles, and king slimes, which are very large slimes wearing crowns and come in various versions, such as <b>regular</b> <b>or</b> metal.|$|E
5|$|By solving Apollonius' problem {{repeatedly}} {{to find the}} inscribed circle, the interstices between mutually tangential circles can be filled arbitrarily finely, forming an Apollonian gasket, {{also known as a}} Leibniz packing or an Apollonian packing. This gasket is a fractal, being self-similar and having a dimension d that is not known exactly but is roughly 1.3, which is higher than that of a <b>regular</b> (<b>or</b> rectifiable) curve (d = 1) but less than that of a plane (d = 2). The Apollonian gasket was first described by Gottfried Leibniz in the 17th century, and is a curved precursor of the 20th-century Sierpiński triangle. The Apollonian gasket also has deep connections to other fields of mathematics; for example, it is the limit set of Kleinian groups.|$|E
5|$|The Commonwealth was {{not ready}} for war. In 1631, the royal army {{numbered}} barely 3,000 men; the Smolensk garrison was about 500 strong, and most garrisons in the border area were composed not of <b>regular</b> <b>or</b> mercenary soldiers but of 100 to 200 local volunteers. Aware that Russia was preparing for war, {{in the spring of}} 1632 the Sejm (Polish-Lithuanian parliament) increased the army by recruiting an additional 4,500 men; by mid-1632 the deputy voivode (podwojewoda) of Smolensk, Samuel Drucki-Sokoliński, had about 500 volunteers from pospolite ruszenie and 2,500 regular army soldiers and Cossacks. In May the Senate of Poland agreed to increase the size of the army, but Grand Lithuanian Hetman Lew Sapieha objected, arguing that the current forces were enough and that war was not likely. Nonetheless the Field Lithuanian Hetman Krzysztof Radziwiłł recruited an additional 2,000 soldiers.|$|E

5|$|The USAD {{requires}} {{a diversity of}} achievement within each team; teams must have students who fall into three categories determined by GPA. The Honors category is composed of students with GPAs between 3.75 and 4.0. The Scholastic category consists of students with GPAs between 3.0 and 3.74. The final group, the Varsity category, contains students whose GPA ranges from 0.00 to 2.99. USAD uses a modified GPA scale in which performance-based classes such as music, art or physical education are omitted from the GPA calculation. A grade counts for face value {{regardless of whether it}} is from an advanced placement, honors, <b>regular</b> <b>or</b> remedial class. An A is counted as a 4.0, a B as a 3.0, a C as a 2.0, a D as a 1.0, and a F as a 0. Only final grades taken from the previous two complete school years are used to calculate GPA.|$|E
