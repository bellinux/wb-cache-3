5|$|Holkham's north-facing coastal {{location}} {{can attract}} {{large numbers of}} migrating birds in autumn if the weather conditions are right, especially with a north to north-east wind. The common species may {{be accompanied by a}} wryneck, <b>red-backed</b> <b>shrike</b> or greenish warbler in August, with goldcrests, thrushes and finches later in the season, and perhaps red-breasted flycatchers and yellow-browed warblers. Vagrant rarities such as Pallas's, Radde's or dusky warblers may occur; a red-breasted nuthatch in 1989 was the first, and, as of 2012, the only individual of its species to be recorded in the UK.|$|E
25|$|There are 147 avian {{species that}} are {{associated}} with the Peneda-Gerês park, especially along the Mourela region {{in the southern part of}} its frontier. In this region, although it might vary throughout the year (given climate and season), approximately 36 species make their nests in the area. Of particular note in this park are the: hen harrier (Circus cyaneus), European honey buzzard (Pernis apivorus), common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), <b>red-backed</b> <b>shrike</b> (Lanius collurio), yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella), garden warbler(Sylvia borin) and whinchat (Saxicola rubetra). For the winchat (Saxicola rubetra), the area of Mourela is the unique nesting ground in Portugal, while the <b>red-backed</b> <b>shrike</b> and yellowhammer are limited to Castro Lombeiro plateau and northern corners of the park.|$|E
25|$|Many {{species of}} animal live on Lüneburg Heath, {{particularly}} birds that are {{at home in the}} wide, open landscape, some of which are seriously threatened by the intensive-farming techniques in other areas. These include the: black grouse (Tetrao tetrix), the nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus), the woodlark (Lullula arborea), the great grey shrike (Lanius excubitor), the <b>red-backed</b> <b>shrike</b> (Lanius collurio), the northern wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe), the wryneck (Jynx torquilla), the European green woodpecker (Picus viridis), the stonechat (Saxicola torquata), the Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), the common quail (Coturnix coturnix) and the black stork (Ciconia nigra). In the Lüneburg Heath the population of the very rare black grouse is rising continually. In 2007 78 were counted, 13 more than in the previous year. Since 2003 the number of grouse has doubled.|$|E
40|$|Animals often settle near competitors, a {{behavior}} known as social attraction, which belies standard habitat selection theory. Two hypotheses account for these observations: individuals obtain Allee benefits {{mediated by the}} physical presence of a competitor, or they use successfully settled individual {{as a source of}} information indicating the location of high quality habitat. We evaluated these hypotheses experimentally in two species of shrikes. These passerine birds with a raptor-like mode of life impale prey to create larders that serve as an indicator of male/habitat quality. Thus, two forms of indirect information are available in our system: a successfully settled shrike and its larder. Typically these two cues are associated with each other, however, our experimental treatment created an unnatural situation by disassociating them. We manipulated the presence of larders of great grey shrikes and examined the settling decisions of <b>red-backed</b> <b>shrikes</b> within and outside the great grey <b>shrike</b> territories. Male <b>red-backed</b> <b>shrikes</b> did not settle sooner on plots with great grey shrikes compared to plots that only contained artificial larders indicating that <b>red-backed</b> <b>shrikes</b> do not use the physical presence of a great grey shrike when making settling decisions which is inconsistent with the Allee effect hypothesis. In contrast, for all plots without great grey <b>shrikes,</b> <b>red-backed</b> <b>shrikes</b> settled, paired and laid clutches sooner on plots with larders compared to plots without larders. We conclude that <b>red-backed</b> <b>shrikes</b> use larders of great grey shrikes as a cue to rapidl...|$|R

500|$|A {{review of}} American and Pacific golden plover records was begun in 1991, {{with the purpose}} of {{evaluating}} whether any individuals previously accepted as [...] "either American or Pacific" [...] could now be definitely assigned to one species or the other (and vice versa). The results (a small {{decrease in the number of}} accepted American golden plovers, and a small increase in the number of accepted Pacifics) were published in the committee's report for 1996, with a comment that a detailed paper on the subject was being prepared, although as of 2009, this has not been published. A review of isabelline shrike records commenced in 1986. This review, the results of which were published in 1989, established a racial identification for a number of adult isabelline shrikes previously accepted to species level. A further review, with the same aim, was begun in the late 1990s. A preliminary set of results of this review was published in 2003; four previously accepted individuals were rejected, including one, in Cambridgeshire in 1978, which is now thought have been a hybrid with <b>red-backed</b> <b>shrike.</b> The full results of this second review were published in 2007; some of the previous racial attributions were withdrawn, but the committee felt able to confidently assign a race for a number of more recent individuals, although it stressed that this could only be done with adult birds (the committee's 2005 report mentions that a further article is in preparation). A review of black-eared wheatears was conducted in 2002–04, with the aim of assigning individuals to the eastern and western races where possible; this was possible with nine records; both western hispanica and eastern melanoleuca were shown to have occurred.|$|E
2500|$|Ulisse Aldrovandi, Conrad Gessner, John Ray and Francis Willughby also {{reported}} old folk names, mainly from Germanic languages: Wereangel or Wierangel from the Pennines of England (where {{the bird was}} noted as a vagrant) as well as Warkangel, Werkengel or Wurchangel in various German dialects (e.g. around Frankfurt/Main and Strasbourg) probably mean [...] "choking angel" [...] (cf. Standard German Würgeengel). These names are unlikely to significantly pre-date the times of Saint Boniface (c. 700 AD) because of their Christian connotation; the related Werkenvogel ("choking bird") might, however, do so. The English version, having become wariangle or weirangle, was eventually transferred to the native <b>red-backed</b> <b>shrike</b> (L. collurio) and lingered on into modern times in Yorkshire. Along the Upper Rhine, between Strasbourg and Heidelberg for example, Linkenom is attested; its origin is unclear. Low German Neghen-doer and Middle German Nünmörder were also used; this has today evolved into Neuntöter and specifically means the <b>red-backed</b> <b>shrike,</b> but could in earlier times refer to any native Lanius.

40|$|Migratory birds track {{seasonal}} resources {{across and}} between continents. We propose a general strategy of tracking the broad seasonal abundance of resources throughout the annual cycle in the longest-distance migrating land birds {{as an alternative}} to tracking a certain climatic niche or shorter-term resource surplus occurring, for example, during spring foliation. Whether and how this is possible for complex annual spatiotemporal schedules is not known. New tracking technology enables unprecedented spatial and temporal mapping of long-distance movement of birds. We show that three Palearctic-African species track vegetation greenness throughout their annual cycle, adjusting the timing and direction of migratory movements with seasonal changes in resource availability over Europe and Africa. Common cuckoos maximize the vegetation greenness, whereas <b>red-backed</b> <b>shrikes</b> and thrush nightingales track seasonal surplus in greenness. Our results demonstrate that the longest-distance migrants move between consecutive staging areas even within the wintering region in Africa to match seasonal variation in regional climate. End-of-century climate projections indicate that optimizing greenness would be possible but that vegetation surplus might be more difficult to track in the future...|$|R
6000|$|On June 24, when {{walking towards}} the pool, I spied two {{recumbent}} human figures on {{a stretch of}} level turf near its banks, and near them a something dark on the grass--a pair of clap-nets! [...] "Still another serpent in my birds' paradise!" [...] said I to myself, and, walking on, I skirted the nets {{and sat down on}} the grass beside the men. One was a rough brown-faced country lad; the other, who held the strings and wore the usual cap and comforter, was a man of about five-and-twenty, with pale blue eyes and yellowish hair, close-cropped, and the unmistakable London mark in his chalky complexion. He regarded me with cold, suspicious looks, and, when I talked and questioned, answered briefly and somewhat surlily. I treated him to tobacco, and he smoked; but it wasn't shag, and didn't soften him. On mentioning casually that I had seen a stoat an hour before, he exhibited a sudden interest. It was as if one had said [...] "rats!" [...] to a terrier. I succeeded after a while in getting him to tell me the name of the man to whom he sent his captives, and when I told him that I knew the man well--a bird-seller in a low part of London--he thawed visibly. Finally I asked him to look at a <b>red-backed</b> <b>shrike,</b> perched on a bush about fifteen yards from his nets, through my field-glasses, and from that moment he became as friendly as possible, and conversed freely about his mystery. [...] "How near it brings him!" [...] he exclaimed, with a grin of delight, after looking at the bird. The shrike had greatly annoyed him; it had been hanging about for some time, he told me, dashing at the linnets and driving them off when they flew down to the nets. Two or three times he might have caught it, but would not draw the nets and have the trouble of resetting them for so worthless a bird. [...] "But I'll take him the next time," [...] he said vindictively. [...] "I didn't know he was such a handsome bird." [...] Unfortunately, the shrike soon flew away, and passing linnets dropped down, drawn to the spot by the twitterings of their caged fellows, and were caught; and so it went on for a couple of hours, we conversing amicably during the waiting intervals. For now he regarded me as a friend of the bird-catcher. Linnets only were caught, most of them young birds, which pleased him; for the young linnet after a month or two of cage life will sing; but the adult males would be silent until the next spring, consequently they were not worth so much, although the carmine stain in their breast made them for the time so much more beautiful.|$|E

40|$|<b>Red-backed</b> <b>shrikes</b> (Lanius collurio) behave quite {{differently}} towards two common nest predators. While the European jay (Garrulus glandarius) is commonly attacked, {{in the presence}} of the Eurasian magpie (Pica pica), shrikes stay fully passive. We tested the hypotheses that this passive response to the magpie is an alternative defense strategy. Nesting shrikes were exposed to the commonly attacked European kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) in a situation in which i) a harmless domestic pigeon, ii) a commonly attacked European jay, and iii) a non-attacked black-billed magpie are (separately) presented nearby. The kestrel dummy presented together with the magpie dummy was attacked with a significantly lower intensity than when it was presented with the other intruders (pigeon, jay) or alone. This means that the presence of the magpie inhibited the shrike's defense response towards the other intruder. These results support our previous hypotheses that shrikes use an alternative defense strategy in the magpie's presence. We hypothesize that the magpie is able to associate the active defense of the shrikes with the close proximity of a nest and that shrikes try not to draw the magpie's attention to the nest. The reason why this strategy is not used against the jay remains unanswered as jays as well as magpies show very similar cognitive and foraging skills enabling them to individuate the nest presence according to active parental defense...|$|R
40|$|Preference {{measures}} {{are widely used}} in habitat selection studies to test an animal’s choice relative to particular habitat features, but most {{measures are}} subject to criticism as they fail to indicate the underlying behavioral motivation. Order of settlement on breeding sites has been proposed as an effective measure in migratory organisms, as it conceptually approaches a choice experiment. We tested the assumption that early <b>red-backed</b> <b>shrikes</b> (Lanius collurio) {{are more willing to}} defend their territorial resource than individuals arriving later. We earlier showed that shrikes arriving first settled in forest plantations that resulted in lower reproductive success compared to territories on farmland, suggesting an ecological trap. Therefore, individuals are expected to place higher value on the lower quality sites in forests. Within the context of resource valuation theory in animal contests, we used a simulated territorial intrusion experiment to measure territorial defense and to evaluate the perceived value of the territory during the settlement phase in both habitat types. Males arriving early were much more motivated to defend their territory than late birds. After correction for the disparity in the timing of arrival between habitat types, shrikes also more vigorously defended their territories in the forest habitat associated with the lowest reproductive returns. Although some resource valuation mechanisms remain unclear, our results show that early and late-arriving individuals strongly differ in behavioral motivation to hold their territorial resources. This study also demonstrates {{for the first time that}} organisms may exhibit a higher degree of territorial aggressiveness in a lower quality habitat...|$|R
