5|$|In {{the case}} of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the Court of Appeal {{expanded}} the scope of judicial review by adopting an objective test when reviewing the exercise of executive discretion. In contrast to the subjective test, the objective test permits the court to examine whether the decision-maker's satisfaction was based on objective facts which fell {{within the scope of}} the purposes specified by the ISA. The subjective satisfaction or mere ipse dixit of the executive body is insufficient. However, the adoption of this objective test was only part of the obiter dicta of the case. The <b>ratio</b> <b>decidendi</b> of the case was based on narrower technical grounds.|$|E
500|$|With {{regard to}} the marital rape {{exemption}}, Lord Keith agreed with the Court of Appeal that the marital rape exemption was a [...] "common law fiction" [...] and ruled that [...] "in modern times the supposed marital exemption in rape forms {{no part of the}} law of England." [...] Lord Brandon of Oakbrook, Lord Griffiths, Lord Ackner and Lord Lowry all unanimously agreed with Lord Keith's <b>ratio</b> <b>decidendi.</b> As such R's appeal was dismissed and his conviction upheld. R’s appeal was accordingly dismissed, and he was convicted of the rape of his wife.|$|E
500|$|The {{main problem}} with the Act was {{whether or not the}} {{claimant}} had to know he had a method of action or not for the standard limitation period to apply. The House of Lords had an opportunity to resolve this in Central Asbestos Co Ltd v Dodd but [...] "failed spectacularly", making a decision so confused that the Court of Appeal in Harper and others v National Coal Board said they could not actually find a <b>ratio</b> <b>decidendi</b> anywhere in the House of Lords' opinion. The Act also suffered from drafting problems - in Central Asbestos Lord Reid described it as having [...] "a strong claim to the distinction of being the worst drafted Act on the statute book". The Act was repealed piecemeal by a series of Acts during the 1970s, and the Limitation Act 1980 finally repealed the last remaining sections.|$|E

500|$|The <b>ratio</b> <b>decidendi,</b> {{or legal}} {{point in the}} case which {{determined}} the judgment, was a narrow one. The appeals were allowed {{on the ground that}} the Minister had not discharged the burden of proving the validity of the detention orders. Under section 8(1) of the ISA, the President's satisfaction that a person poses a national security risk is a condition precedent to the Minister's power to make a detention order. The Minister attempted to demonstrate that the President had been so satisfied before the detention order was made by pointing {{to the fact that the}} recitals in the detention orders stated that the President [...] "is satisfied", and by filing an affidavit by the Permanent Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs which asserted that the [...] "government" [...] was satisfied that the appellants were a danger to national security. However, the Court of Appeal found that this was inadmissible evidence as it amounted to hearsay. Furthermore, as regards the affidavit, the satisfaction of the Government was not the same as the President's satisfaction.|$|E
500|$|The courts' {{cautiously}} optimistic acceptance of Pepper, which included {{an attempt to}} include it in the House of Lords' Practice Directions, soon began to wane. Although the lower courts applied the decision and allowed the use of Hansard, and the Lords itself initially followed it in R v Warwickshire County Council, ex parte Johnson, several objections and limits were expressed in later obiter dicta and <b>ratio</b> <b>decidendi.</b> The first judicial complaints were voiced in 1997 by Lord Hoffmann in The Intolerable Wrestle with Words and Meanings, where he criticised the increased expense and drop in efficiency which it created. In {{a speech to the}} Chancery Bar Lord Millett calling the judgment [...] "a regrettable decision" [...] that [...] "was not only misguided in practical terms, it was in my view contrary to principle", saying that: [...] The courts immediately began to [...] "whittle down" [...] the precedent set by Pepper. The first direct attack came through Massey v Boulden, where the Court of Appeal held that Hansard could not be used in criminal law cases, because of [...] "the principle that penal statutes are to be narrowly construed intervenes to resolve any ambiguity without resort to Hansard".|$|E
500|$|Thomas Bonham v College of Physicians, {{commonly}} known as Dr. Bonham's Case or simply Bonham's Case, was a case decided in 1610 by the Court of Common Pleas in England, under Sir Edward Coke, the court's Chief Justice, who explained why he thought that [...] "in many cases, the common law will control Acts of Parliament". Coke's meaning has been disputed over the years. According to one interpretation, Coke intended the kind of judicial review that would later develop in the United States, but other scholars believe that Coke meant only to construe a statute, not to challenge parliamentary sovereignty. If Coke intended the former, he may have later changed his view. The statement by Coke is sometimes considered to be obiter dicta, rather than part of the <b>ratio</b> <b>decidendi</b> of the case. Dr Bonham's case was a statement that engaging in peaceful and honest trade without a piece of parchment called a [...] "license" [...] was not a [...] "crime", and that no command of the monarch or Act of the Monarch in Parliament could make engaging in peaceful and honest trade without a piece of parchment called a [...] "license" [...] a [...] "crime".|$|E
500|$|Legal {{certainty}} and {{the orderly}} development of legal principles are {{promoted by the}} application of the doctrine of stare decisis, also known as the doctrine of binding precedent. According to this doctrine, the decisions of higher courts are binding on lower courts. Thus, judgments of the Court of Appeal are binding on the High Court, and judgments of both of these superior courts are binding on subordinate courts. A judge is generally not bound by previous decisions made by other judges in courts of the same level. Thus, a judge hearing a High Court case need not follow previous High Court decisions. Nonetheless, courts generally do so as a matter of comity, unless there are good reasons for doing otherwise. As the final appellate court in Singapore, the Court of Appeal is not bound by its previous decisions or those of predecessor courts such as the Privy Council. However, the Court continues to treat such decisions as [...] "normally binding" [...] and only departs from them [...] "where adherence to such prior decisions would cause injustice in a particular case or constrain the development of the law in conformity with the circumstances of Singapore". Only the <b>ratio</b> <b>decidendi</b> (that is, the legal principle that determines the outcome) of a case is binding according to the doctrine of stare decisis; other legal principles expressed that are not crucial to the final decision (obiter dicta) are only persuasive.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the accusations}} of {{nepotism}} that greeted his appointment on January 3, 1903, Sifton fast became a well-respected judge. [...] He served as {{chief justice of}} the Northwest Territories until September 16, 1907, when the Supreme Court of Alberta was established, whereupon he headed this new court, sitting in Calgary as the first Chief Justice of Alberta. [...] He was notoriously difficult for barristers to read: he generally heard arguments expressionlessly smoking a cigar, and it was as a judge that he first acquired his long-time nickname of the Sphinx for his inscrutability. [...] In one trial, he sat apparently vigorously taking notes during both sides' lengthy closing arguments and, once they concluded, immediately delivered his judgment. [...] The bewildered lawyers wondered what he had been writing down, since he had obviously made up his mind before closing arguments; once Sifton had left the courtroom, they found their answer in the form of page after page covered with the judge's signature. [...] He rarely recorded his <b>ratio</b> <b>decidendi</b> but, despite this, few of his decisions were overturned on appeal. It has also been argued that his fellow judges had difficulty ruling on appeals from his decisions specifically because he rarely provided reasons. Much of his work was in criminal law, dealing especially with theft of livestock (in which cases he generally delivered a sentence of three years hard labour, severe {{by the standards of the}} day). By the end of his judicial career, he had convicted as many Americans as Canadians. His rulings were generally concerned with practicalities rather than legal theory, based more on social morality than legal precedent, and he did not establish any important precedents.|$|E

2500|$|In {{common law}} jurisdictions, nearly every case that {{presents}} {{a bona fide}} disagreement on the law is resolved in a written opinion. [...] The legal reasoning for the decision, known as <b>ratio</b> <b>decidendi,</b> not only determines the court's judgment between the parties, but also stands as precedent for resolving future disputes. In contrast, civil law decisions typically do not include explanatory opinions, and thus no precedent flows from one decision to the next.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, most actions alleging vicarious {{liability}} for intentional torts failed, {{primarily on the}} grounds that no employer employs an individual to be dishonest, or to commit crimes. This was the view taken with regard to most intentional torts, with several exceptions. Morris v CW Martin & Sons Ltd, for example establishes {{vicarious liability}} of thefts by an employee, where there is a non-delegable duty to keep the claimant's possessions safe. However, the scope of such liability was limited to torts committed in the course of employment, under the second limb of Salmond's course of employment test. This precluded recovery for torts committed while an employee was not involved in the furtherance of his employer's business. The importance vested in Salmond's test was not reconsidered until Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd, a case involving vicarious liability for sexual abuse. In following the <b>ratio</b> <b>decidendi</b> of the Supreme Court of Canada in the case of Bazley v Curry, the House of Lords established a newer test for finding liability in cases of intentional torts; where a tort committed by an employee is closely connected to their duties, their employer may be found liable. Although of undoubted greater use to claimants, the judicial latitude given to this test has been occasionally regarded as questionable. Lord Nicholls has stated that a [...] "lack of precision is inevitable given the infinite range of circumstances where the issue arises." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ratio</b> <b>decidendi</b> (Latin plural rationes decidendi) is a Latin phrase meaning [...] "the reason" [...] or [...] "the {{rationale}} for the decision". The <b>ratio</b> <b>decidendi</b> is [...] "the point {{in a case that}} determines the judgment" [...] or [...] "the principle that the case establishes".|$|E
5000|$|Obiter dictum (usually {{used in the}} plural, obiter dicta) is Latin phrase meaning [...] "by the way", that is, {{a remark}} in a {{judgment}} that is [...] "said in passing". It is a concept derived from English common law, whereby a judgment comprises only two elements: <b>ratio</b> <b>decidendi</b> and obiter dicta. For the purposes of judicial precedent, <b>ratio</b> <b>decidendi</b> is binding, whereas obiter dicta are persuasive only.|$|E

50|$|The {{doctrine}} of jurisprudence constante also influences how court decisions are structured. In general, court decisions of common law jurisdictions give a sufficient <b>ratio</b> <b>decidendi</b> as to guide future courts. The ratio {{is used to}} justify a court decision {{on the basis of}} previous case law as well as {{to make it easier to}} use the decision as a precedent for future cases. By contrast, court decisions in some civil law jurisdictions (most prominently France) tend to be extremely brief, mentioning only the relevant legislation and codal provisions and not going into the <b>ratio</b> <b>decidendi</b> in any great detail. This is the result of the legal positivist view that the court is only interpreting the legislature's intent and therefore detailed exposition is unnecessary. Because of this, <b>ratio</b> <b>decidendi</b> is carried out by legal academics (doctrinal writers) who provide the explanations that in common law jurisdictions would be provided by the judges themselves.|$|E
50|$|In other words, <b>ratio</b> <b>decidendi</b> is a {{legal rule}} derived from, and {{consistent}} with, those parts of legal reasoning within a judgment on which {{the outcome of the}} case depends.|$|E

50|$|The major {{premise is}} {{constituted}} by a legal norm (or rule).

50|$|The High Court {{was divided}} with the {{majority}} of judges agreeing as to the conclusions but for different reasons such that there was no majority opinion and the <b>ratio</b> <b>decidendi</b> is, in part, uncertain.

50|$|The <b>ratio</b> <b>decidendi</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} tools available to a lawyer.

50|$|In total, four judges {{held the}} {{legislation}} was valid under the external affairs power, {{but there was}} not a majority of judges agreeing on the test for determining validity.

5000|$|The appeal on count 1 was dismissed, {{while the}} appeal on count 2 was allowed {{because in the}} present case there had been a {{misdirection}} in relation to the meaning of [...] "decency" [...] and the offence of [...] "outrage".

5000|$|The {{suggested}} <b>ratio</b> <b>decidendi</b> (Latin: {{the reason}} for the decision) of the case has varied from the narrowest, jokingly suggested by Julius Stone, that there was merely a duty [...] "not to sell opaque bottles of beverage containing dead snails to Scots widows", to the widest, suggested by Lord Normand, who had been one of Stevenson's counsel, that Lord Atkin's neighbour principle was the ratio.|$|E
50|$|In English law, a dictum is any {{statement}} made {{as part of}} {{a judgment}} of a court. Thus the term includes dicta stated incidentally, in passing (obiter dicta), that are not a necessary part of the rationale for the court's decision (referred to as the <b>ratio</b> <b>decidendi).</b> English lawyers do not, as a rule, categorise dicta more finely than into those that are obiter and those that are not.|$|E
50|$|Where {{there are}} several members of a court, there may be one or more {{judgments}} given; only the <b>ratio</b> <b>decidendi</b> of the majority can constitute a binding precedent, but all may be cited as persuasive, or their reasoning may be adopted in argument. Quite apart from the rules of precedent, the weight actually given to any reported judgment may depend on the reputation of both the court and the judges.|$|E
5000|$|A {{judicial}} statement can be <b>ratio</b> <b>decidendi</b> only if {{it refers}} to the crucial facts and law of the case. Statements that are not crucial, or which refer to hypothetical facts or to unrelated law issues, are obiter dicta. Obiter dicta (often simply dicta, or obiter) are remarks or observations made by a judge that, although included {{in the body of the}} court's opinion, do not form a necessary part of the court's decision. In a court opinion, obiter dicta include, but are not limited to, words [...] "introduced by way of illustration, or analogy or argument". Unlike <b>ratio</b> <b>decidendi,</b> obiter dicta are not the subject of the judicial decision, even if they happen to be correct statements of law. The so-called Wambaugh's Inversion Test provides that to determine whether a judicial statement is ratio or obiter, you should invert the argument, that is to say, ask whether the decision would have been different, had the statement been omitted. If so, the statement is crucial and is ratio; whereas if it is not crucial, it is obiter.|$|E
