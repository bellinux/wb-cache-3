5|$|An equally {{important}} reform was {{the abolition of}} private tax farming, which was replaced by salaried civil service tax collectors. Private contractors who collected taxes for the State were the norm in the Republican era. Some of them were powerful enough to influence the number of votes for men running for offices in Rome. These tax farmers called publicans were infamous for their depredations, great private wealth, and the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> local areas.|$|E

A cease-fire contracted at Stary Targ (the Truce of Altmark) on 26 October 1629 favored the Swedes, who received the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> Polish trade moving over the Baltic (3.5% {{of the value of}} goods), retained control of many cities in Royal Prussia, and were recognized as the dominant power on the southern Baltic coast. Koniecpolski exerted little influence on the negotiations, as he had been called back to Ukraine to crush a Tartar incursion.|$|E
5|$|Mason slowly {{moved from}} being a {{peripheral}} figure towards the center of Virginia politics, but his published response to the Stamp Act, which he opposed, is most notable {{for the inclusion of}} his anti-slavery views. George Washington or George William Fairfax, the burgesses for Fairfax County, may have asked Mason's advice as to what steps to take in the crisis. Mason drafted an act to allow {{for one of the most}} common court actions, replevin, to take place without the use of stamped paper, and sent it to George Washington, by then one of Fairfax County's burgesses, to gain passage. This action contributed to a boycott of the stamps. With the courts and trade paralyzed, the British Parliament repealed the Stamp Act in 1766, but continued to assert the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> the colonies.|$|E

The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> half the <b>taxes</b> was then sold to the Archbishop of Mainz, who then sold the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> Frankfurt. An Imperial representative was sent to Frankfurt <b>to</b> collect the <b>taxes</b> and safeguard {{the rights of the}} Jews. In 1372 the city purchased the office from the Emperor for 6,000 Marks.

5|$|Villani and the Buonaccorsi {{had gained}} an unsavory {{reputation}} {{as early as}} 1331, when Villani was tried (and cleared) for barratry {{for his part in}} building the new third circuit of walls around Florence. Charles, Duke of Calabria had granted the Buonaccorsi the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> three of the six districts of Florence, which did not help Villani's reputation amongst his fellow citizens. In early June 1342, partners and agents of the Buonaccorsi suddenly fled Florence, Avignon, and Naples, following bankruptcy proceedings by creditors, nearly all of whom had deposits in the Buonaccorsi bank. Like other Florentine bankers and companies having difficulty with bankruptcy at the time, in September 1342 they supported the move to invite WalterVI of Brienne to become the next signor of Florence. Walter later suspended all legal actions taken against the Buonaccorsi and other company partners for nearly a year.|$|E
5|$|Haakon {{pursued a}} foreign policy that was active in all {{directions}} (although foremost {{to the west and}} south-east). In the north-east, the relationship with Novgorod had been tense due to a dispute over the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> the Sami people, as well as raiding from both Norwegian and Karelian sides. Eventually, the Mongol threat drove Prince Alexander Nevsky to negotiations with Haakon that likely strengthened Norwegian control of Troms and Finnmark. An embassy from Novgorod one time asked for Haakon's daughter Christina for a marriage, but Haakon refused due to the Mongol threat. Due to the Elven-based Norwegian presence in the seas around the south of Sweden and into the Baltic Sea, Norway increasingly relied on Baltic grain from Lübeck. The import was however halted in the late 1240s due to the plundering of Norwegian ships in Danish seas by ships from Lübeck. In 1250, Haakon made a peace and trade agreement with Lübeck, which eventually also opened the city of Bergen to the Hanseatic League. During the conflict, Haakon had reportedly been offered control over the city by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. In any case, Haakon's policy regarding Northern German ports largely derived from his strategy of attempting to exploit the internal turmoil that had erupted in Denmark following the death of King Valdemar II in 1241.|$|E
25|$|A new {{ministry}} under Lord North came {{to power}} in 1770, and Parliament withdrew all taxes except the tax on tea, giving up its efforts to raise revenue while maintaining the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax.</b> This temporarily resolved the crisis, and the boycott of British goods largely ceased, with only the more radical patriots such as Samuel Adams continuing to agitate.|$|E

In compensation, he received two lordships in the Argolid: Argos and Nauplia and Damala. According to Marino Sanudo Torsello, he acquired the kommerkion (a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> commerce) of Corinth as well. The city of Thebes itself became Othon's capital and the economic centre of his domains, due to its silk industry. Athens itself remained Othon's residence. There he lived in his castle atop the Acropolis.|$|E

All claimed the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> the Sami people, and Finnish-speaking tax collectors from the northern coast of the Gulf of Bothnia reached the northern coasts, their Russian colleagues collected taxes as far west as the Harstad area of Norway and the Norwegian tax collectors collected riches from the inland of the Kola peninsula.|$|E
25|$|Norway's {{regional}} administration is organised in 19 counties (fylke), with 18 of them subdivided into 431 municipalities (kommune) per 1 January 2006. The municipal sector is {{a provider of}} vital services to the Norwegian public, accounting for about 20% of Norwegian GNP and 24% of total employment. Norway had 435 municipalities of varying size in 2003, each administered by an elected municipal council. They are grouped into 19 counties (fylker), each governed by an elected county council. Each county is headed by a governor appointed by the king in council. Oslo is the only urban center that alone constitutes a county; the remaining 18 counties consist of both urban and rural areas. County and municipal councils are popularly elected every four years. The municipalities have wide powers over the local economy, with the state exercising strict supervision. They have the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> and to use their resources to support education, libraries, social security, and public works such as streetcar lines, gas and electricity works, roads, and town planning, but they are usually aided in these activities by state funds.|$|E

In 1730, he sent a Maratha force under Chimaji Appa to Gujarat. Sarbuland Khan, the Mughal Governor of the province, ceded <b>to</b> Marathas, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> collect chauth and sardeshmukhi from Gujarat. He was soon replaced by Abhay Singh, who also recognized the Maratha <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> collect <b>taxes.</b> However, this success irked Chhatrapati Shahu's senapati(commander-in-chief) Trimbak Rao Dabhade. His ancestors from Dabhade clan had raided Gujarat several times, asserting their <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> collect <b>taxes</b> from that province. Annoyed at Bajirao's control over what he considered his family's sphere of influence, he rebelled against the Peshwa.

[...] In early 1765, the Stamp Act was passed by both houses of Parliament in England. [...] This act was a scheme for taxing the colonies, directing that all commercial and legal documents, to be valid in a court of law, must be written on stamped paper sold at fixed prices by governmental officers, and also directing that a duty be applied to newspapers.

500|$|The medieval chronicler Matthew Paris {{said that}} Boniface was [...] "noted more for his birth than for his brains." [...] He showed little {{concern for the}} spiritual duties of his office. His exactions and his {{overbearing}} behaviour, combined {{with the fact that}} he was a foreigner, offended the English. He was heavily involved in advancing the fortunes of his family on the continent, and spent fourteen of the twenty-nine years he was archbishop outside England. He made strenuous efforts to free his office from debt, as he had inherited a see that was in debt over 22,000 marks, but managed to clear the debt before his death. He did this by securing the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> his clergy, for seven years, from the papacy. When a number of bishops refused to pay, they were suspended from office. He also worked for the canonisation of Edmund of Abingdon while he was at the papal court-in-exile at Lyon from 1244 to 1249.|$|E
500|$|State governments {{retain the}} <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> newspapers, {{just as they}} may tax other {{commercial}} products. Generally, however, taxes that focus exclusively on newspapers have been found unconstitutional. In Grosjean v. American Press Co. (1936), the Court invalidated a state tax on newspaper advertising revenues, holding {{that the role of}} the press in creating [...] "informed public opinion" [...] was vital. Similarly, some taxes that give preferential treatment to the press have been struck down. In Arkansas Writers' Project v. Ragland (1987), for instance, the Court invalidated an Arkansas law exempting [...] "religious, professional, trade and sports journals" [...] from taxation since the law amounted to the regulation of newspaper content. In Leathers v. Medlock (1991), the Supreme Court found that states may treat different types of the media differently, such as by taxing cable television, but not newspapers. The Court found that [...] "differential taxation of speakers, even members of the press, does not implicate the First Amendment unless the tax is directed at, or presents the danger of suppressing, particular ideas." ...|$|E
500|$|News of the Tea Act {{set off a}} {{firestorm}} of protest in the colonies. This was not a dispute about high taxes; the price of legally imported tea was actually reduced by the Tea Act. Protesters were instead concerned {{with a variety of}} other issues. The familiar [...] "no taxation without representation" [...] argument remained prominent, along with the question of the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies. Some colonists worried that, by buying the cheaper tea, they would be conceding that Parliament had the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> them. The [...] "power of the purse" [...] conflict was still at issue. The tea tax revenues were to be used to pay the salaries of certain royal officials, making them independent of the people. Colonial smugglers {{played a significant role in}} the protests, since the Tea Act made legally imported tea cheaper, which threatened to put smugglers of Dutch tea out of business. Legitimate tea importers who had not been named as consignees by the East India Company were also threatened with financial ruin by the Tea Act, and other merchants worried about the precedent of a government-created monopoly.|$|E
