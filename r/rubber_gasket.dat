25|$|The iron lung, {{also known}} as the Drinker and Shaw tank, was {{developed}} in 1929 {{and was one of the}} first negative-pressure machines used for long-term ventilation. It was refined and used in the 20th century largely as a result of the polio epidemic that struck the world in the 1940s. The machine is, in effect, a large elongated tank, which encases the patient up to the neck. The neck is sealed with a <b>rubber</b> <b>gasket</b> so that the patient's face (and airway) are exposed to the room air.|$|E
2500|$|Some caskets include {{features}} such as “gasketed”, “protective” or includes a “sealer”. [...] These terms generally mean the casket has a <b>rubber</b> <b>gasket</b> or other feature designed to delay water seepage and prevent rust. [...] According to The Funeral Rule, these features may delay the decomposition of the remains, {{but they will not}} prevent it forever. [...] Some caskets come with warranties, but the warranty is for the durability of the casket, not for protection from eventual decomposition of the remains. [...] Under The Funeral Rule, no person selling any casket may claim that caskets with these features will prevent decomposition of the remains forever, because that is not possible.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pressurisation}} {{system was}} driven by a Rotol supercharger attached to the left-hand engine (this was {{the difference between the}} Merlin 76 and 77), providing a constant pressure of [...] over the exterior pressure. This resulted in an apparent cabin altitude of [...] when the aircraft was operating at its design altitude of [...] This cabin altitude was still too high for normal breathing, so the pilot had to wear an oxygen mask during flight. A <b>rubber</b> <b>gasket</b> filled with the pressurized air sealed the canopy when the system was turned on, and a valve ensured the pressure was controlled automatically. Moreover, the pilot also had to wear a high altitude suit as he might have been required to bail out at altitude.|$|E

50|$|Dielectric grease is {{electrically}} insulating {{and does not}} break down when high voltage is applied. It is often applied to electrical connectors, particularly those containing <b>rubber</b> <b>gaskets,</b> {{as a means of}} lubricating and sealing rubber portions of the connector without arcing.|$|R
30|$|The {{entrance}} is closed by a sliding and tight door, with <b>rubber</b> <b>gaskets</b> in good condition, but no additional thermal protection devices were present every time door was opened (e.g. PVC curtains or air curtain devices).

2500|$|The SD60I {{model has}} a full-width short hood and {{features}} the so-called [...] "WhisperCab" [...] that was insulated from sound and vibration using {{a system of}} <b>rubber</b> <b>gaskets.</b> The same cab was later used on EMD's SD70I, SD75I, SD80MAC and SD90MAC locomotives. Only Conrail ordered this model, and all now belong to the Norfolk Southern Railway and CSX Transportation.|$|R
25|$|ESCs {{provide all}} of the {{features}} and functions expected of a typical splice closure in an enclosure that prevents the intrusion of liquid and vapor into the closure interior. This is accomplished {{through the use of}} an environmental sealing system such as <b>rubber</b> <b>gaskets</b> or hot-melt adhesives. Some ESCs use pressurized air to help keep moisture out of the closure.|$|R
50|$|Redline - Reference kits {{available}} in either solid black or solid white with matching lugs and hoops. True to its name, the <b>rubber</b> <b>gaskets</b> on the lugs and bass drum claws were dyed red. The kits came in different size shellpacks in rock-styled configurations. The Redline series were {{released in the}} US in 2008 and in Europe (as a Masters Premium kit) at the Musikmesse later that year.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{things go}} badly due to Jaime's and Sheilla's {{different}} leadership styles: while Jaime {{tries to be}} an inspirational leader, Sheilla {{is more of a}} demanding workhorse, trying to get Michelle to help out on the roof. When Michelle refuses, Sheilla does not take it well at all. Terry and Fred, on Candace's roof, would make the mistake of not shingling around the <b>rubber</b> <b>gasket</b> (in fact, the <b>rubber</b> <b>gasket</b> was stapled down to the sheeting with no tar paper underneath). Meanwhile, Angie and Sheilla would begin to work on Terry's roof, while Jaime tackles Ruth's shed with Michelle, leaving Ruth to do nothing. In the end, with only 15 minutes to go in the challenge, and two sheds (Terry's and Candace's) fully done, Jaime and Sheilla decide to abort and cleanup.|$|E
50|$|An {{ammunition}} box or cartridge box is a container designed for safe {{transport and storage}} of ammunition. It is typically made of metal and labelled with caliber, quantity, and manufacturing date or lot number. A <b>rubber</b> <b>gasket</b> is commonly found in the hinged lid to protect the ammunition from moisture damage.|$|E

40|$|This book chapter {{describes}} application {{examples of}} gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and pyrolysis – gas chromatography/mass spectrometry in failure {{analysis for the}} identification of chemical materials like mineral oils and nitrile <b>rubber</b> <b>gaskets.</b> Furthermore, failure cases demanding identification of polymers/copolymers in fouling on the compressor wall of a car air conditioner and identification of fouling {{on the surface of}} a bearing race from the automotive industry are demonstrated. The obtained analytical results were then used for troubleshooting and remedial action of the technological process...|$|R
50|$|Some {{bearings}} use a thick grease for lubrication, {{which is}} {{pushed into the}} gaps between the bearing surfaces, also known as packing. The grease is {{held in place by}} a plastic, leather, or <b>rubber</b> <b>gasket</b> (also called a gland) that covers the inside and outside edges of the bearing race to keep the grease from escaping.|$|E
5000|$|Briccialdi Flutes {{produces}} titanium flute parts (headjoint, stopper, and crown). The titanium stopper is {{a device}} that replaces the standard cork stopper. It allows the headjoint to vibrate more freely thanks to the very small contact surface (only one small <b>rubber</b> <b>gasket,</b> installed and centered by hand) and extraordinary titanium lightness. The titanium crown further reduces the stopper's overall weight ...|$|E
5000|$|The 968 also {{featured}} numerous small equipment and detail upgrades from the 944, including a Fuba roof-mounted antenna, updated single lens tail lamps, [...] "Cup" [...] style 16" [...] alloy wheels, a wider selection of {{interior and exterior}} colors, and a slightly updated [...] "B" [...] pillar and rear quarter window to accommodate adhesive installation to replace the older <b>rubber</b> <b>gasket</b> installation.|$|E
50|$|The {{printing}} {{depends on}} the smooth flow of ink, which can be hindered if the ink begins to dry at the print head, as can happen when an ink level becomes low. Dried ink can be cleaned from a cartridge print head using isopropyl alcohol or water. Isopropyl alcohol will damage the printing head, melting the plastic at the connections and <b>rubber</b> <b>gaskets.</b> Tap water contains contaminants that may clog the print head, so distilled water and a lint-free cloth is recommended.|$|R
50|$|Red Hill's {{second trip}} through the Niagara rapids came on May 30, 1931, this time {{choosing}} a steel barrel 6 ft long and 3 ft in diameter. The opening was a 14 x 18 in manhole, covered by sliding steel and sealed with <b>rubber</b> <b>gaskets.</b> There were air holes on each side, which were plugged with cork and could be removed. The contraption weighed over 600 lb and was painted red with gold lettering that read “William Red Hill, Master Hero of Niagara” inscribed on both sides.|$|R
5000|$|The SD70I is {{a version}} of the SD70M which has been fitted with a cab that is {{isolated}} from the frame of the locomotive with <b>rubber</b> <b>gaskets</b> (officially known as a [...] "WhisperCab"). The isolation reduces noise and vibration from the prime mover. A seam is visible across the nose and on the long hood where the cab connects with the body. 26 examples of this model locomotive were produced, all for Canadian National Railway. The WhisperCab feature was incorporated into some SD70MAC and later models.|$|R
5000|$|Zond 6 used a {{relatively}} uncommon technique called [...] "skip reentry" [...] to shed velocity upon returning to Earth. A {{few hours before}} reentry, on 17 November 1968, a faulty O-ring <b>rubber</b> <b>gasket</b> caused the cabin to depressurise, killing all the animal test subjects aboard. Zond 6's parachutes also deployed too early and it crashed in Kazakhstan, near the designated landing area.|$|E
5000|$|... 2500 3rd Generation Dodge trucks use a 10.5 AAM {{in all the}} V8 {{equipped}} trucks. Some early model Diesel and V10 trucks {{also used}} this axle. Like the 11.5, this axle also uses a re-usable <b>rubber</b> <b>gasket</b> and looks similar to the 11.5 axle. The Ram Power Wagon also uses this axle with a locking differential. 2013 was the last model year that RAM 2500 and 3500 trucks were equipped with this axle.|$|E
50|$|Momsen {{began to}} look for ways to rescue submariners. He {{conceived}} a diving bell, which could be lowered to a submarine in distress, mated to an escape hatch, and opened to allow trapped submariners to climb in. A watertight seal to the submarine could be achieved by placing a <b>rubber</b> <b>gasket</b> around the diving bell's bottom and reducing the air pressure once the bell was over the escape hatch. Then, the hatch could be opened, and the trapped submariners could climb aboard.|$|E
50|$|The EF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM lens {{is often}} {{compared}} to the other L series zoom of comparable range, the 24-70mm f/2.8L USM, losing one full stop but gaining image stabilization (IS) in return, stabilizing camera shake up to three stops. It also has <b>rubber</b> <b>gaskets</b> for moisture and dust protection, although weather sealing is only effective if the photographer uses a weather-resistant camera body. Some early production models of the EF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM lens had a flare problem (reportedly the first 10,000 batch) and Canon offered to repair them for free.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn {{an effort to}} explore the possibility of building compact naval steam condensers, an experimental apparatus was designed and constructed to study enhanced condensation heat transfer of steam on horizontal tubes. Special care was taken to ensure a leak-tight apparatus so that the non-condensable gas content of the steam can be kept to a few parts-per-million. The boiler and steam piping is made of glass and stainless steel with <b>rubber</b> <b>gaskets.</b> Copper {{is used for the}} condensing tubes.

50|$|Hermetic vs. Water-Proof vs. Water-Resistant {{refers to}} the {{coupling}} seal between the contacts, connector insert and body. A true hermetic connector provides an airtight seal and can support and maintain positive pressure or a vacuum. Waterproof connectors prevent liquid ingress when immersed {{using a variety of}} methods (e.g., molding, potting and encapsulating) to prevent water intrusion at high hydrostatic pressures. Water resistant implies that a coupled connector will prevent water ingress that can lead to shorting in shallow standing water or rain. Typically this is achieved by inserting <b>rubber</b> <b>gaskets</b> and compression seals at the contract region {{as well as at the}} cable entry.|$|R
50|$|Seals in {{high-pressure}} {{vessels are}} also susceptible to explosive decompression; the O-rings or rubber gaskets used to seal pressurised pipelines {{tend to become}} saturated with high-pressure gases. If the pressure inside the vessel is suddenly released, then the gases within the <b>rubber</b> <b>gasket</b> may expand violently, causing blistering or explosion of the material. For this reason, {{it is common for}} military and industrial equipment to be subjected to an explosive decompression test before it is certified as safe for use.|$|E
50|$|Cell casting is {{a method}} used for {{creating}} poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) sheets. Liquid monomer is poured between two flat sheets of toughened glass sealed with a <b>rubber</b> <b>gasket</b> and heated for polymerization. Because the glass sheets may contain surface scratches or sag during the process, this traditional method has some disadvantages: among other problems, the PMMA sheets may contain variations in thickness and surface defects. It has since {{been replaced by the}} more modern method for making PMMA, extrusion, which gives uniform quality.|$|E

50|$|Subsequently, Washington Gas Light {{experienced}} a 16-fold increase in gas leaks on residential service connections in Prince George's County, Maryland, which is served directly by pipeline from the plant. These leaks come from mechanical couplings which contain <b>rubber</b> <b>gaskets.</b> Washington Gas Light claims {{that because the}} Cove Point gas has less hexane and other heavy hydrocarbons than does domestic natural gas, the Cove Point gas causes the gaskets to dry out and leak. Cove Point disputes these claims and argues that Washington Gas's arguments are flawed and the expansion will not cause additional leaks in the District of Columbia and Northern Virginia suburbs as the area served by unblended LNG increases.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-1990s, {{just prior}} to their buyout by Seagate, Conner Peripherals started using a {{cost-saving}} measure on its low-end drives. Instead of bolted-down, cast aluminum lids with <b>rubber</b> <b>gaskets,</b> Conner Peripherals {{came up with a}} design that used a thinner stamped aluminum lid, and a thick adhesive tape seal along the perimeter of the lid, where the lip of the lid meets the base casting. This design used no screws to hold on the lid [...] - [...] just cutting the tape could permanently damage the drive by making the lid come off. This design was kept well after the Seagate buyout, and was discontinued in 1999.|$|R
