40|$|The Internet {{has become}} an {{integral}} part of our nation 2 ̆ 7 s critical socio-economic infrastructure. With its heightened use and growing complexity however, organizations are at greater risk of cyber crimes. To aid in the investigation of crimes committed on or via the Internet, a network forensics analysis tool pulls together needed digital evidence. It provides a platform for performing deep network analysis by capturing, recording and analyzing network events to find out the source of a security attack or other information security incidents. Existing network forensics work has been mostly focused on the Internet and fixed networks. But the exponential growth and use of wireless technologies, coupled with their unprecedented characteristics, necessitates the development of new network forensic analysis tools. This dissertation fostered the emergence of a new research field in cellular and ad-hoc network forensics. It was one of the first works to identify this problem and offer fundamental techniques and tools that laid the groundwork for future research. In particular, it introduced novel methods to record network incidents and <b>report</b> <b>logged</b> incidents. For recording incidents, location is considered essential to documenting network incidents. However, in network topology spaces, location cannot be measured due to absence of a 2 ̆ 7 distance metric 2 ̆ 7. Therefore, a novel solution was proposed to label locations of nodes within network topology spaces, and then to authenticate the identity of nodes in ad hoc environments. For <b>reporting</b> <b>logged</b> incidents, a novel technique based on Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) was adopted. Although the direct use of DHTs for <b>reporting</b> <b>logged</b> incidents would result in an uncontrollably recursive traffic, a new mechanism was introduced that overcome this recursive process. These <b>logging</b> and <b>reporting</b> techniques aided forensics over cellular and ad-hoc networks, which in turn increased their ability to track and trace attacks to their source. These techniques were a starting point for further research and development that would result in equipping future ad hoc networks with forensic components to complement existing security mechanisms...|$|R

Wells in the Nagaoka site have been used for monitoring logging of CO 2 behavior for more than ten years, and have experience of large earthquakes near the site. Time-lapse ultrasonic and cement bond logging have been employed to investigate the well integrity of the observation wells. Results of the ultrasonic logging showed that there was no sever damage or deformation in the casing at the reservoir depth. No clear change in cement can be seen in either logging results, even at the depth where the cement was exposed to the CO 2. These results showed that there was no clear evidence of CO 2 leakage at Nagaoka...|$|R

40|$|Multimedia {{streaming}} applications have substantially {{changed the}} market policy of {{an increasing number}} of content providers that offer streaming services to the users. The need for effective video content delivery re-fueled interest for caching: since the Web-like workload of the 90 s are not longer fit to describe the new Web of videos, in this work we investigate the suitability of the publicly available Netflix dataset for caching studies. Our analysis shows that, as the dataset continuously evolves (i) a steady state description is not statistically meaningful and (ii) despite the cache hit ratio decreases due to the growth of active movies in the catalog, simple caching replacement approaches are close to the optimum given the growing skew in the popularity distribution over the time. Additionally, we point out that, since the dataset <b>reports</b> <b>logs</b> of movie ratings, anomalies arise when ratings are considered to be movie views. At the same time, we show anomalies yield conservative caching results, that reinforces the soundness of our study. </p...|$|R
