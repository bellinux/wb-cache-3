A pair of digitalized surfaces of a 250 x 250 mm concrete rough fracture replica were numerically manipulated to simulate the translational and rotary shearing processes of the sample, using Finite Element Method (FEM). Different fluid flow situations were cosidered. For the translational shear three different flow patterns-unidirectional, bi-directional and radial-have been taken into account. For <b>rotary</b> <b>shear,</b> only the radial flow patterns have been considered. Furthermore, {{the effect of the}} fracture surface roughness on the aperture and transmissivity fields was evaluated using semi-variograms. The results of flow and particle transport simulations show that translational shear yields a channelling effect in the direction perpendicular to shear direction, creating high transmissivity channels through which the particles travelling in this direction can travel fast and without being delayed by bypassing low transmissivity areas. Bi-directional flow patterns show clearly the shortcomings of the conventional shear-flow tests in the laboratory with a unidirectional flow. In radial flow patterns, while translational shear generates an anisotropic particle transport behaviour with faster transport perpendicular to shear direction, <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> presents isotropic flow field and particle paths in all directions...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{effect of}} <b>rotary</b> inertia and <b>shear</b> effect becomes an {{important}} aspect for heavy rotors. The Euler–Bernoulli beam element is used for approximation in case of slender rotors and {{it is necessary for}} heavy rotors to consider <b>rotary</b> inertia and <b>shear</b> effect. These effects tend to change the mass and stiffness matrix of shaft element. This paper presents the comparison of modal behaviour using Rayleigh beam element which includes rotary inertia effect, Timoshenko beam element which includes both <b>rotary</b> inertia and <b>shear</b> effect with Euler–Bernoulli beam element which excludes both <b>rotary</b> inertia and <b>shear</b> effect. The convergence of first three natural frequencies is shown and the results are compared with the experimental modal analysis data. Upon comparison of the results it is confirmed that <b>rotary</b> inertia and <b>shear</b> effect gives more accurate results and should be included for the analytical calculation of dynamic parameters of rotor system...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSpherical {{aggregates}} named clay-clast aggregates (CCAs) {{have been}} reported from recent investigations on retrieved clay-bearing fault gouges from shallow depth seismogenic faults and <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> experiments conducted on clay-bearing gouge at seismic slip rates. The formation of CCAs appears {{to be related to}} the shearing of a smectite-rich granular material that expands and becomes fluidized. We have conducted additional high-velocity <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> experiments and low-velocity double-shear experiments. We demonstrate that a critical temperature depending on dynamic pressure-temperature conditions is needed for the formation of CCAs. This temperature corresponds to the phase transition of pore water from liquid to vapor or to critical, which induced gouge pore fluid expansion and therefore a thermal pressurization of the fault. A detailed examination by energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX-SEM) element mapping, SEM, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows strong similar characteristics of experimental and natural CCAs with a concentric well-organized fabric of the cortex and reveals that their development may result from the combination of electrostatic and capillary forces in a critical reactive medium during the dynamic slip weakening. Accordingly, the occurrence of CCAs in natural clay-rich fault gouges constitutes new unequivocal textural evidence for shallow depth thermal pressurization and consequently for past seismic faulting...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of 11 <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> tests conducted on replicas of three hollow cylinders of natural fractures with JRC values of 7. 7, 9. 4 and 12. 0. The JRC values were determined from the results of laser profilometer measurements. The replicas were created from gypsum cement. By varying the water-to-gypsum cement ratio from 30 to 45 %, fracture replicas with different values of compressive strength (JCS) were created. The <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> experiments were performed under constant normal (nominal) stresses ranging between 0. 2 and 1. 6 MPa. In this report, the shear test results are compared with predictions using Barton`s empirical peak shear strength equation. observations during the experiments indicate that only certain parts of the fracture profiles influence fracture shear strength and dilatancy. Under relatively low applied normal stresses, the JCS {{does not seem to have}} a significant effect on shear behavior. As an alternative, a new procedure for predicting the shear behavior of fractures was developed. The approach is based on basic fracture properties such as fracture surface profile data and the compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, and Poisson`s ratio of the fracture walls. Comparison between predictions and actual shear test results shows that the alternative procedure is a reliable method...|$|E
40|$|A <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> {{apparatus}} {{has been}} newly {{set up in}} Chiba University which can control the temperature near a sliding surface, T_meas, up to 1000 °C independently from slip rate, V. Frictional experiments at 0. 010 m/s, 1 MPa normal stress, and variable T_meas for dolerite have revealed a remarkable effect of temperature on the friction coefficient, f. With increasing T_meas, f starts from 0. 7 to 0. 8 at room temperature (RT), decreases down to 0. 5 – 0. 6 at 400 °C, increases until 800 °C, and then decreases again. We have also conducted XRD analyses of the wear materials (mainly submicron particles) and investigated microstructures of the sliding surfaces developed at different temperatures T_meas, {{and we found that}} there is a negative correlation between f and the amount of amorphous material except at RT and 1000 °C. The generation of the amorphous phase probably causes the weakening. There is no amorphous phase recognized for a sample at 1000 °C which is an aggregate of rounded crystals. EBSD analyses show that the material on the sliding surface at 1000 °C contains randomly oriented hematite grains, which together with the observed microstructural features suggests that granular flow was taking place. We have also demonstrated that f depends not only on the instantaneous value of temperature, but also on its history. By comparing with conventional <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> friction experiment for the same dolerite without temperature control, we conclude that strong “rate weakening” as recently observed in high-velocity frictional experiments without an active control of the temperature has a significant amount of contribution from the temperature effect...|$|E
40|$|This {{work has}} studied the effect of shear on the melt {{crystallization}} behavior of three poly(1 -butene) materials at several shear rates and degrees of undercooling. The poly(1 -butene) samples investigated varied in {{number average molecular weight}} from 35, 000 to 105, 000. Crystallization was carried out using a parallel plate <b>rotary</b> <b>shearing</b> apparatus mounted on the stage of an optical microscope. Photographic techniques were used to record nuclei formation and size during crystallization over a shear rate range of 0 sec(2 ̆ 7 - 1) to 12 sec(2 ̆ 7 - 1). The data was analyzed in light of classical nucleation theory and Avrami kinetics. The imposition of shear during crystallization generally accelerated the transformation process through increased nucleation rates. The process was also characterized by a reduction in induction times which generally showed a saturation effect with shear. The negative temperature coefficient of the nucleation rate becomes less negative for shear crystallization over the range studied. ^ Shear stresses of the crystallizing melt were measured on a separate instrument and were found to increase rapidly with the onset of crystallization. The rise in shear stress paralleled the rise in nuclei formation. The corresponding increase in viscosity could be accounted for by using an effective nuclei volume concept during the early stages of crystallization. ^ Morphological studies of sheared samples show deformed spherulites and row-nucleated structures. ^ The observations here lead {{to the conclusion that the}} shear stress in the system induce a certain amount of molecular orientation which greatly accelerates the overall crystalline transformation process. The large increase in the nucleation process which is believed to be directly related to the orientation in the system, is the main contributing factor to the rapid crystallization as well as the decrease in induction period. ...|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{pressurization}} of {{pore fluid}} {{is one of}} the possible mechanisms responsible for dynamic weakening in landslides and earthquakes, but, to date, has not been reproduced in the laboratory. Here, we report high-velocity experiments performed in a <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> friction apparatus on smectite-rich gouges from the 1963 Vaiont landslide (Italy). The gouges were slid under 1 MPa normal stress, for displacements up to 30 m and a slip rate of 1. 31 m s- 1 under room-humidity and water-saturated conditions. Sample dilatancy was observed in room-humidity runs after similar to 3 - 4 m of slip, concomitant with an increase in normal stress and a decrease in shear stress. Mineralogical and microstructural investigations suggest that dilatancy resulted from expansion of the H(2) O released by the collapse of the smectite structure due to frictional heating of the slipping zone at T > 200 degrees C.

40|$|This thesis aims to {{elucidate}} {{the effects of}} pressure solution and phyllosilicates on the compaction and shear behaviour of granular materials chosen to simulate fault gouge deforming under hydrothermal conditions. I implemented three different experimental programs. The first program consists of compaction experiments on quartz sand and phyllosilicate-bearing quartz sand. Clear evidence was found for compaction by IPS. The main conclusion is that IPS compaction under the conditions studied, {{is controlled by the}} rate of dissolution of quartz within the grain contacts. The presence of muscovite hinders compaction, through a chemical retardation effect, on the dissolution rate, of aluminium ions dissolved in the fluid from the muscovite. The second program consists of high strain <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> experiments performed on simulated fault gouges consisting of halite-muscovite mixtures. I observed velocity-strengthening behaviour up to a sliding velocity of 0. 3 - 1 μm/s, along with the development of a mylonitic microstructure consisting of an anastomosing foliation enveloping elongate halite clasts. The deformation mechanism was slip on the phyllosilicate foliation with accommodation by pressure solution of the intervening halite. At higher velocities, I observed a velocity weakening effect in the mixtures of halite and muscovite. This was accompanied by a cataclastic microstructure with no foliation but with significant porosity development. I explain this behaviour in terms of a granular flow mechanism involving competition between dilatation and pressure solution controlled compaction. The time-dependence of compaction leads to higher porosities at higher sliding velocities. Higher porosity implies a lower dilatancy angle for granular flow and thus faster shear produces a lower macroscopic shear strength. Slide-hold-slide experiments show that samples deformed in the low-velocity regime do not restrengthen on re-shear, while those deformed in the high velocity regime regain high strength. Healing rates, recorded for the latter samples, increase with sliding velocity. This is explained by a higher steady state porosity being maintained during steady state sliding, so that compaction is increased during hold periods. The increased compaction leads to an increased granular dilatancy angle, hence higher healing rates following rapid slip. The third program consists of <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> experiments on simulated quartz gouges under hydrothermal conditions. They show strain hardening up to a shear strain γ of 0. 6 - 1. 8, followed by weakening of up to 30...|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{materials}} {{reinforced with}} nanoparticles {{have an enormous}} range of applications owing to their superb mechanical and physical properties. More specifically, recent progress has shown that using inorganic nanomaterials as fillers in polymer/inorganic composites has tremendous application potential in automotive, aerospace, construction and electronics industries. If properly incorporated into a polymeric matrix, conductive nanofillers such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene can be assembled into a three-dimensional electrical network. ^ A series of dynamic compressive experiments were performed to experimentally investigate the electrical response of multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) reinforced epoxy nanocomposites subjected to split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) loading. Low-resistance CNT/epoxy specimens were fabricated {{using a combination of}} shear mixing and ultrasonication. Utilizing the carbon nanotube network within, the electrical resistance of the nanocomposites was monitored using a high-resolution four-point probe method during each compressive loading event. In addition, real-time deformation images were captured using high-speed photography. The percent change in resistance was correlated to both strain and real-time damage. The results were then compared to previous work conducted by the authors (quasi-static and drop-weight impact) in order to elucidate the strain rate sensitivity on the electrical behavior of the material. In addition, the percent change in conductivity was determined using a Taylor expansion model to investigate the electrical response based upon both dimensional change as well as resistivity change during mechanical loading within the elastic regime. Experimental findings indicate that the electrical resistance is a function of both the strain and deformation mechanisms induced by the loading. The bulk electrical resistance of the nanocomposites exhibited an overall decrease of 40 – 65 % for quasi-static and drop-weight experiments and 65 – 85 % for SHPB experiments. ^ An experimental investigation was conducted to understand the electro-mechanical response of graphene reinforced polystyrene composites under static and dynamic loading. Graphene-polystyrene composites were fabricated using a solution mixing approach followed by hot-pressing. Absolute resistance values were measured with a high-resolution four-point probe method for both quasi-static and dynamic loading. A modified split Hopkinson (Kolsky) pressure bar apparatus, capable of simultaneous mechanical and electrical characterization, was developed and implemented to investigate the dynamic electro-mechanical response of the composites. In addition to measuring the change in electrical resistance as well as the dynamic constitutive behavior, real-time surface damage and global deformation was captured using high-speed photography. The real-time damage was correlated to both stress-strain and percent change in resistance profiles. The experimental findings indicate that the bulk electrical resistance of the composite increased significantly due to the brittle nature of the polystyrene matrix and the presence of relative agglomerations of graphene platelets which resulted in micro-crack formations. ^ The novel capillary-driven particle-level templating technique was then extended to allow for distribution of conductive sheet-like particles, such as graphite nanoplatelets (GNPs) into specially constructed architectures throughout a polystyrene matrix to form multi-functional composites with tailored electro-mechanical properties. By precisely controlling the temperature and pressure during a melt compression process, highly conductive segregated composites were formed using very low loadings of graphene particles. Since the graphene flakes form a honeycomb percolating network along the boundaries between the polymer matrix particles, the composites show very high electrical conductivity but poor mechanical strength. To improve the mechanical properties, a new processing technique was developed that uses <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> through fixed angles to gradually evolve the honeycomb graphene network into a concentric band structure over the dimensions of the sample. An experimental investigation was conducted to understand the effect of GNP loading as well as the <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> angle on the mechanical strength and electrical conductivity of the composites. The experimental results show that both the electrical and mechanical properties of the composites are significantly altered using this very simple technique, which allows rational co-optimization of competing mechanical and electrical performance as appropriate for a given target application. ^ Flexible multi-functional composites with tailored electro-mechanical properties were produced using a modified capillary-driven particle-level templating technique. A fixed-angle <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> technique was utilized during the melt compression process to distribute GNPs into specially constructed architectures throughout a styrene-butadiene matrix. An experimental investigation was conducted to understand the effect of GNP loading as well as <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> angle on the mechanical strength and electrical conductivity of the composites. The experimental results show that this technique can be used to produce flexible composites that possess exceptional conductivity while still maintaining the salient mechanical characteristics the copolymer has to offer.

In Section 5, a nonlinear bearing model is proposed, taking into account the rolling elements speed of rotation, nonlinear stiffness, clearance(s) (with allowance for coupling between the radial clearance and deadband), and elastic interaction with the rotating shaft. The bearing nonlinear reaction forces and the gyroscopic loading vector are treated as external loads. With rigid disks included, Lagrange’s equations are used to derive equations of motion that, in turn, are decoupled using modal analysis, expressed in the normal coordinates representation.

Seismic slip propagation is {{facilitated by}} along-fault low dynamic frictional resistance, which is controlled {{by a number of}} physico-chemical lubrication mechanisms. In particular, <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> experiments conducted at seismic slip rates (1 [*]ms(- 1)) show that phyllosilicates can facilitate co-seismic slip along faults during earthquakes. This evidence is crucial for hazard assessment along oceanic subduction zones, where pelagic clays participate in seismic slip propagation.

We document the occurrence of micrometer-thick phyllosilicate-bearing layers along a carbonate-hosted seismogenic extensional fault in the central Apennines, Italy.

An artificial fault was sheared at small incremental rotational steps under the normal stress of 2. 5 MPa. During shearing, mechanical data including normal force and torque were measured and {{used to calculate the}} friction coefficient. After each rotation increment, a μCT scan was conducted to observe the sample structure. The careful and quantitative μCT image analysis allowed for direct and continuous observation of the fault evolution. We observed that fracturing due to asperity interlocking and breakage dominated the initial phase of slipping. The frictional behavior stabilized after 1 mm slip distance, which inferred the critical slip distance. We developed a novel approach to estimate the real contact area on the fault surface by means of μCT image analysis. Real contact area varied with increased shear distances as the contacts between asperities changed, and it eventually stabilized at approximately 12...|$|E
30|$|Friction {{coefficients}} were measured {{by using a}} <b>rotary</b> <b>shear</b> apparatus (described in Mizoguchi et al. 2009). Approximately 500  mg of water-saturated powdered host rock was placed between the ends of two cylinders of sandstone (25  mm diameter) and sealed in a polytetrafluoroethylene sleeve to prevent leaks. The experiments were performed at ambient humidity under normal stresses that were increased in 0.5  MPa increments from 0.5 to 2.5  MPa. The friction coefficient {{has been shown to}} be generally velocity dependent and to have its peak value at velocities around 0.01  m s− 1, independent of rock type (e.g., Di Toro et al. 2011; Niemeijer et al. 2012). In addition, values at high slip velocities of 0.1 – 1.0  m s− 1 reflect the effects of weakening mechanisms such as powder lubrication (Reches and Lockner 2010) and thermal decomposition (Han et al. 2007). We thus adopted a velocity of 0.01  m s− 1 to represent peak friction during earthquakes. The shear stress was measured with a slip displacement after a correction for friction between the rock cylinders and the sleeve (approximately 0.01), which was determined from the shear stress at zero normal stress.|$|E
40|$|Violin strings are {{relatively}} short and stiff and are well modeled by Timoshenko beam theory. We use the static {{part of the}} homogeneous differential equation of violin strings to obtain new shape functions for the finite element analysis of rotating Timoshenko beams. For deriving the shape functions, the rotating beam is considered as a sequence of violin strings. The violin string shape functions depend on rotation speed and element position along the beam length and account for centrifugal stiffening effects as well as <b>rotary</b> inertia and <b>shear</b> deformation on dynamic characteristics of rotating Timoshenko beams. Numerical {{results show that the}} violin string basis functions perform much better than the conventional polynomials at high rotation speeds and are thus useful for turbo machine applications.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{influence}} of the two-parameter elastic soil on the dynamic behaviour of a beam with variable cross-section is examined, in the presence of conservative axial loads. The beams are assumed to follow the well-known Timoshenko hypotheses, in order to take into account both the <b>rotary</b> inertia and <b>shear</b> deformation effect. The Rayleigh–Ritz approach is used and Boundary Characteristic Orthogonal Polynomials are chosen as trial functions; (BCOPs method [2]). The theory is concisely presented in a matrix form, so that the contribution of the rotary inertia and of the soil can be easily recognized. Various examples and comparisons are illustrated, in order to emphasize {{the influence of}} the soil properties and of the beam taper ratio. Finally, the results are also compared with the results given by other authors, using exact and approximate approaches...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Mathematical {{modeling}} {{of the impact}} of a solid body upon a buffer positioned on a thin isotropic plate, whose dynamic behaviour is described by the Uflyand-Mindlin wave equations taking the <b>rotary</b> inertia and <b>shear</b> deformations into account, is investigated. Two types of the isotropic plate are considered in the present paper: elastic and viscoelastic. The buffer represents a steel screw cylindrical spring and a liquid damper connected with the spring consecutively. Wave equations allow to assume that in a plate the transient wave of transverse shear, because of which there is a deformation of a plate material outside of contact area, is generated with final velocity. As a method of the decision the ray method and method of splicing asymptotic expansion received for small times in a contact area and outside of it are used. ...|$|R
