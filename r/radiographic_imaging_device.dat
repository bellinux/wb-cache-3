Silver and gold nanoparticles (NPs) have been successfully employed as antibacterial motifs; however, NPs leaching in addition to poor dispersion and overall reproducibility are major hurdles to further product development. In this study, the authors design and fabricate a smart antibacterial mixed-matrix membrane coating comprising colloidal lysozyme-templated gold nanoclusters as nanofillers in poly(ethylene oxide) /poly(butylene terephthalate) amphiphilic polymer matrix. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles-lysozyme functionalized gold nanoclusters disperse homogenously within the polymer matrix with no phase separation and zero NPs leaching. This mixed-matrix coating can successfully sense and inhibit bacterial contamination via a controlled release mechanism that is only triggered by bacteria. The system is coated on a common <b>radiographic</b> dental <b>imaging</b> <b>device</b> (photostimulable phosphor plate) that is prone to oral bacteria contamination.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{optimize}} the assessment and implementation of <b>radiographic</b> <b>imaging</b> strategies in children following musculoskeletal trauma, with a special focus on wrist trauma, bicycle spoke injury and children with suspected cervical spine injury. Until now, {{it was not clear}} when <b>radiographic</b> <b>imaging</b> was indicated in children with acute wrist trauma and what type of <b>radiographic</b> <b>imaging</b> was needed in children with bicycle spoke injury. It was unclear if the international guidelines for <b>radiographic</b> <b>imaging</b> of the cervical spine in children were applied correctly and whether the clinical decision tools, which are described in these international guidelines, were suitable for children. Taken all results of our studies into consideration we can conclude that dedicated imaging protocols for the pediatric trauma population are necessary and that protocols used in adults cannot simply be applied in a pediatric population. We believe that with this thesis we are one step closer to optimization of imaging strategies in children with musculoskeletal trauma...|$|R

However, adherence to these guidelines has never been evaluated in a paediatric population. Therefore, we wanted to assess the adherence to the guidelines for C-spine clearance in a level-one trauma centre. We retrospectively included all children, presented at the ED between January 2006 and December 2013, in whom <b>radiographic</b> <b>imaging</b> of the C-spine was obtained following blunt trauma. Primary outcome was the adherence to the international guidelines with regard to (1) if the indication for <b>radiographic</b> <b>imaging</b> was correct and (2) if the type of <b>radiographic</b> <b>imaging</b> was correct. Included were 573 patients; 336 boys (58. 7 %). Median age was 11 years (IQR 5. 25 - 15). The indication for <b>radiographic</b> <b>imaging</b> was correct in all cases.

40|$|Background: Despite a small {{percentage}} of true cervical spine injuries, a high number of the five million patients presenting to emergency departments with suspected cervical spine injuries undergo x-ray or computed tomography to rule out injury. High volume <b>radiographic</b> <b>imaging</b> can lead to higher medical costs as well as the potential for increased risk of cancer in overly exposed patients. The Canadian C-Spine Rule (CCR) is a clinical decision or prediction rule developed in Canada that is used to detect acute cervical spine injury. The objective of this systematic review is to determine if the use of the CCR, results in decreased <b>radiographic</b> <b>imaging</b> of the cervical spine versus unstructured physician judgment. Methods: An extensive search of the literature was conducted using MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Pubmed. Four studies were selected that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: All of the studies reviewed concluded that the CCR was better than unstructured physician judgment at reducing unnecessary <b>radiographic</b> <b>imaging,</b> and the CCR was more sensitive and specific than unstructured physician judgment at detecting cervical spine injury. Conclusion: The CCR is superior to unstructured physician judgment in the reduction of unnecessary <b>radiographic</b> <b>imaging</b> in stable, alert adults with cervical-spine injury. It is also considered a more sensitive and specific tool than relying on individual physician judgment alone...|$|R

40|$|Mixed Matrix Membranes (MMMs) have {{received}} worldwide attention {{during the last}} decades. This {{is due to the}} fact that the resulting materials can combine the good processability and low cost of polymer membranes with the diverse functionality, high performance and thermal properties of the fillers. This work explores the fabrication and application of MMMs. We focused on the design and fabrication of nanofillers to impart target functionality to the membrane for water treatment, protective coating and gas separation. This thesis is divided into three sections according to the application including: I- Water Treatment: This part is divided into three chapters, two related to the membrane distillation (MD) and one related to the oil spill. Three different nanofillers have been used: Periodic mesoporous organosilica (PMO), graphene and carbon nanotube (CNT). Those nanofillers were homogeneously incorporated into polyetherimide (PEI) electrospun nanofiber membranes. The doped nanoparticle not only improved the mechanical properties and thermal stability of the pristine fiber but also enhanced the MD and oil spill performance due to the functionality of those nanofillers. II- Protective coating: This part includes two chapters describing the design and the fabrication of a smart antibacterial and anti-corrosion coating. In the first project, we fabricated colloidal lysozyme-templated gold nanoclusters gating antimicrobial-loaded silica nanoparticles (MSN-AuNCs@lys) as nano-fillers in poly(ethylene oxide) /poly(butylene terephthalate) polymer matrix. MSN-AuNCs@lys dispersed homogeneously within the polymer matrix with zero NPs leaching. The system was coated on a common <b>radiographic</b> dental <b>imaging</b> <b>device</b> that is prone to oral bacteria contamination. This coating can successfully sense and inhibit bacterial contamination via a controlled release mechanism that is only triggered by bacteria. In the second project, the coaxial electrospinning approach has been applied to fabricate smart core-shell nanofiber for controlled release of anti-corrosion material. Acetal-dextran was used as a pH controlled shell of the fibers and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a hydrophilic core. Caffeine, as an anti-corrosion inhibitor was encapsulated in the fiber core to test its potential application as an anticorrosion coating. The almost negligible release was noticed at neutral pH. In acidic pH due to corrosion, the fibers quickly respond by releasing caffeine cargo. III- Gas separation: We describe the synthesis and application of novel ethylene-diamine-based PMO. The novel nanoparticles were homogeneously incorporated into polydimethylsiloxane to fabricate a MMMs thin layer on a porous polyacrylonitrile support. Our results prove that our PMOs can be used as nanofillers to enhance the CO 2 selectivity of the PDMS polymer...|$|R

This study characterized the day- and nighttime use of <b>radiographic</b> <b>imaging</b> for evaluation of intussusception. Methods: The charts of pediatric patients evaluated for intussusception between January 2010 and December 2010 were reviewed retrospectively to evaluate the day- and nighttime use of <b>radiographic</b> <b>imaging.</b> Patients were stratified into day and night groups according to when the imaging studies were performed, and differences in the clinical characteristics, imaging studies, cost, and final diagnosis were compared. Results: Pediatric consultations were performed for 86 suspected intussusceptions: 40 (46. 5 %) during the day [38 (95 %) ultrasounds and 33 (82. 5 %) plain abdominal X-rays] and 46 at night [3 (6. 5 %) computed tomography and 39 (84. 7 %) plain abdominal X-rays]. The rate of positive enemas was significantly higher during the day than at night (97. 5 % vs. 52. 2 %, p <  0. 001). The radiation dose during the initial survey was significantly lower during the day than at night (0. 63  ±  0. 48 vs. 2. 06  ±  1. 48  mSv, p <  0. 001). Conclusion: <b>Radiographic</b> <b>imaging</b> at night results in higher radiation exposure and negative enema findings.
