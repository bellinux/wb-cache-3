30|$|Along with {{abdominal}} imaging, {{the diagnostic}} workup should include blood and stool cultures {{along with a}} search for C. difficile toxin. Although colonoscopy or <b>recto-sigmoidoscopy</b> may be required as second-line diagnostic test, these examinations {{are associated with a}} high risk of perforation in patients with suspected typhlitis [102].|$|E
30|$|In {{both our}} patients, the {{diagnosis}} was established using rectoscopy or <b>recto-sigmoidoscopy</b> and we believe the rectal origin of such masses {{should be the first}} working hypothesis in patients with a surgical history of a rectal pull-through for anorectal malformations. Nevertheless, another rare condition that may have a similar presentation is a posterior urethral diverticulum imprinting the rectum. In adults, posterior urethral diverticula are usually acquired and occur in patients with a history of urethral strictures and multiple urethrotomies (Guneri et al. 2016). However, posterior urethral diverticula can also be a specific complication of the repair of anorectal malformations with recto-urethral fistulas (Pandey et al. 2014; Takazawa et al. 2014). Therefore, if the recto-sigmoid endoscopy is not conclusive, a retrograde and voiding cystourethrography plus a urethroscopy should be considered to complete the work-up.|$|E
30|$|At presentation, pelvic US and {{abdominal}} CT {{showed the}} presence of a pelvic mass, that was considered as a relapse of endometriosis. <b>Recto-sigmoidoscopy</b> demonstrated, at 8  cm from anal verge, an ulcerated rectal mass of 4  cm in diameter, whose biopsies, however, were negative for malignancy. Via a laparotomy, 6  cm mass between rectum and uterus, corresponding to the ulcerated mass, adherent also to the presacral plain and vagina, was biopsied, and a diverting left colostomy created. At histology, a well-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma was diagnosed without evidence of tumor in the surrounding tissues. No metastases were detected at staging imaging. Therefore, the patient was staged as pT 4 pN 0 pM 0 and started on neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with Folfox [oxaliplatin, fluorouracil (5 FU) and folic acid] for 9  months. In retrospect, the paraffin embedded specimens of the tumor, reviewed years later for this study, were not adequate for proper DNA extraction and microsatellite instability test was not possible.|$|E
40|$|The {{long-established}} approaches {{utilized to}} treat fecal incontinence always require instrumentation with {{some type of}} electronic equipment. This equipment is not always available in every institutions. In addition, no studied protocol principally used as coordination, sensory, or strength training has reached the level of gold standard. The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe a simple biofeedback technique that incorporating a mental variable and not requiring electronic equipment with prior adequate training could be used at any medical institution. Methods: A particular modality of an operant conditioning technique was given once and a home trainer program was established. Forty-eight patients (mean age 37. 1 ± 3. 7 years) were recruited. Patients had suffered from total incontinence for a period of 55 ± 7. 5 months, all used two to three pads per day and suffered 2. 4 ± 0. 2 episodes of incontinence per day. Patients underwent clinical history recording, laboratory tests, <b>recto-sigmoidoscopy,</b> and double-contrast barium enema. Manometry and rectal sensitivity were performed in 7 and 27 patients, respectively. For physiologic comparisons, 21 healthy volunteers were used. Results: A total of 79. 1 % of patients became continent in a median period of 3. 9 ± 0. 5 months. An average of 3. 85 ± 0. 55 sessions was required. Follow-up continued for 3 - 11 years. Patients with incontinence showed lower basal mean resting pressure, maximum squeeze pressure and rectal sensitivity (p < 0. 01) and spontaneous rectoanal inhibitory reflex was absent in 57 %. Conclusions: This biofeedback approach does not employ any type of electronic equipment and can be easily reproduced in any type of medical center. Additionally, this is the first report in which a methodology for biofeedback therapy successfully incorporates a mental variable in addition to sensory and strength training...|$|E
