40|$|Heart failure (HF) is a serious, life {{limiting}} {{chronic illness}} {{and is the}} most common cause of < 30 -day hospital readmission, which is costly both in its profound negative impact on patient mortality and quality of life, and in economics. Limited access to care in rural communities increases the prevalence of hospitalizations for heart disease in rural areas. The aims of this project using data mined from Arizona Health Sciences Center Clinical Research Data Warehouse, are to define clinical events (fever, pain, changes in respiratory status, change in level of consciousness, changes in output, bleeding, and suicide ideation) for patients with heart failure, and determine what assessment values are for chronically ill patients and compare to "normal" assessment values for non-chronically ill patients. A literature review was completed to determine how to define clinical events for chronically ill patients with HF, and how decision making is used at home to manage chronic illness. Assessment value data was mined from the clinical research data warehouse and compared to “normal” assessment values, with identification of associations between clinical events and action taken in the hospital. The project results support that there are differences in "normal" assessment values for fever, pain, and change in respiratory status between chronically ill patients with HF, and non-chronically ill patients; there was insufficient data to define bleeding, change in output, or suicide ideation. Impacts to care include earlier recognition of worsening HF symptoms that could result in an earlier call or visit to primary care provider forestalling the need for emergent care and hospital <b>readmission.</b> <b>Application</b> of the mined clinical may inform development of evidenced-based algorithm to guide decision-making at home, and it may also provide the foundation for the development of a tool for patient use to prevent < 30 -day hospital readmission...|$|E

25|$|In October 1911, Knox {{attempted}} {{to rejoin the}} army and applied {{to the office of}} the surgeon general for <b>readmission.</b> His <b>application</b> was received in 1912, and unfortunately his application was not well received. Although it is not clear precisely why Knox fell out of favor of the army, there are several possibilities. It is possible that his discovery and reported treatment of rampant venereal disease while at Fort Hancock was frowned upon, as at the time venereal disease was quite stigmatizing and his treatment of it might have been considered immoral. It is also possible that the rapid dissolution of his marriage to Marion, and quick remarriage to Gladys, painted him as an unreliable man. In any case, he was not permitted readmission to the army.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Poor {{adherence}} to pharmacotherapy negatively affects {{the course and}} the outcome of schizophreniaspectrum psychoses, enhancing the risk of relapse. Falloon and coworkers developed a Psychoeducation Program aimed at improving communication and problem-solving abilities in patients and their families. This study set out to evaluate changes in {{adherence to}} pharmacotherapy in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum psychoses, by comparing one group exposed to the Falloon Psychoeducation Program (FPP) with another group exposed to family supportive therapy with generic information on the disorders. METHODS: 340 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and related disorders according to standardized criteria from 10 participating units distributed throughout the Italian National Health System (NHS), will be enrolled with 1 : 1 allocation by the method of blocks of randomized permutations. Patients will be reassessed at 6, 12 and 18 months after start of treatment (duration: 6 months). The primary objective is to evaluate changes in adherence to pharmacotherapy after psychoeducation. Adherence will be assessed at three-month intervals by measuring blood levels of the primary prescribed drug using high pressure liquid chromatography, and via the Medication Adherence Questionnaire and {{a modified version of}} the Adherence Interview. Secondary objectives are changes in the frequency of relapse and readmission, as the main indicator of the course of the disorder. Enrolled patients will be allocated to the FPP (yes/no) randomly, 1 : 1, in a procedure controlled by the coordinating unit; codes will be masked until the conclusion of the protocol (or the occurrence of a severe negative event). The raters will be blind to treatment allocation and will be tested for blinding after treatment completion. Intention-to-treat will be applied in considering the primary and secondary outcomes. Multiple imputations will be applied to integrate the missing data. The study started recruitment in February 2013; the total duration of the study is 27 months. DISCUSSION: If the psychoeducation program proves effective in improving adherence to pharmacotherapy and in reducing relapse and <b>readmissions,</b> its <b>application</b> could be proposed as a standard adjunctive psychosocial treatment within the Italian NHS.
