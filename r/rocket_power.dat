The ride {{opened with}} the {{adjacent}} Game Site as Bumper Bowl before being renamed and rethemed to <b>Rocket</b> <b>Power</b> Bumper Beach from 2002 through to 2011. It was renamed a third time in 2011 to Bumper Beach. It remained under this name until late 2012 when it was closed to become part of Kung Fu Panda: Land of Awesomeness. Throughout its lifetime, the ride's entrance and exit gates have been modified several times although the actual ride has not been moved.|$|E
25|$|Omega Factor is a beat 'em up game {{starring}} Astro Boy, {{the main}} character of the Astro Boy media franchise. Astro attacks enemies using high-powered punches and kicks, which can also knock enemies into other ones and destroy them as well. Using attack moves slowly fills a gauge {{at the top of}} the screen. Once the gauge is filled, Astro is able to perform a special attack; rather than simply helping the player, these are required in some situations. Astro is also able to fly using <b>rocket</b> <b>power,</b> which is also sometimes necessary.|$|E
25|$|During the 1920s, {{a number}} of rocket {{research}} organizations appeared worldwide. In 1927 the German car manufacturer Opel began to research rocket vehicles together with Mark Valier and the solid-fuel rocket builder Friedrich Wilhelm Sander. In 1928, Fritz von Opel drove a rocket car, the Opel-RAK.1 on the Opel raceway in Rüsselsheim, Germany. In 1928 the Lippisch Ente flew: <b>rocket</b> <b>power</b> launched the manned glider, although it was destroyed on its second flight. In 1929 von Opel started at the Frankfurt-Rebstock airport with the Opel-Sander RAK 1-airplane, which was damaged beyond repair during a hard landing after its first flight.|$|E

25|$|XCOR Aerospace was {{developing}} a suborbital vehicle called Lynx until development was halted in May 2016. The Lynx will {{take off from}} a runway under <b>rocket</b> <b>power.</b> Unlike SpaceShipOne and SpaceShipTwo, Lynx will not require a mothership. Lynx is designed for rapid turnaround, which will enable it to fly up to four times per day. Because of this rapid flight rate, Lynx has fewer seats than SpaceShipTwo, carrying only one pilot and one spaceflight participant on each flight. XCOR expect to roll out the first Lynx prototype and begin flight tests in 2015. It was hoped that Lynx would carry paying customers {{before the end of}} 2016.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} half of 2002, the {{entrance}} to the Tower of Terror was relocated to {{the opposite side of the}} track. This was followed by the closure of the Central Cafe, Kennyland and part of Village Oval. Shortly after, a temporary children's area opened in Gum Tree Gully. Known as the Kid's Carnival, the area featured several of the rides from Kennyland including the Dream Copters, Kenny Karts and Adventure Trails. A children's ferris wheel was also included in the lineup. In August 2002, it was announced that Dreamworld would be adding Nickelodeon Central, however, specific details at the time were sparse. After investing $7 million Dreamworld officially opened Nickelodeon Central on 26 December 2002. New attractions included Rugrats Runaway Reptar roller coaster, Wild Thornberry's Rainforest Rampage and the Slime Bowl. The Zumer from the Country Fair themed area was relocated to Nickelodeon Central and rethemed to Swinger Zinger. Kennyland's Dream Copters ride was relocated and resumed operation under the same name and theme. The existing Carousel, Bumper Bowl and Avalanche were renamed to Nick-O-Round, <b>Rocket</b> <b>Power</b> Bumper Beach and Angry Beavers Spooty Spin, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|In June 1937, at Neuhardenberg (a large field about [...] east of Berlin, {{listed as}} a reserve {{airfield}} {{in the event of}} war), one of these latter aircraft was flown with its piston engine shut down during flight by test pilot Erich Warsitz, at which time it was propelled by von Braun’s <b>rocket</b> <b>power</b> alone. Despite the wheels-up landing and having the fuselage on fire, it proved to official circles that an aircraft could be flown satisfactorily with a back-thrust system through the rear.|$|E
2500|$|A {{major reason}} {{for the growth of}} Edwards AFB was the {{nearness}} of West Coast aircraft manufacturers. [...] However, another major reason was the decision in 1947 to build a missile test facility on the base. [...] The need for a static missile faculty to test high-thrust missile rocket engines was first envisioned in 1946 by the Power Plant Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. [...] It was that decision that such a facility should be government-owned to prevent a single contractor exclusive advantages on Air Force contracts for high-thrust missile <b>rocket</b> <b>power</b> plants, and it would eliminate duplication of like facilities by different manufacturers. [...] The choice of location in 1947 was the Leuhman Ridge east of Rogers Dry Lake on Edwards AFB. [...] Construction began in November 1949 on what was to become the Experimental Rocket Engine Test Station.|$|E
2500|$|The report’s {{details of}} the final moments of the flight reveal that the feather system was {{unlocked}} as SS2 accelerated under <b>rocket</b> <b>power</b> through Mach 0.92 at 10.07:28, some 9 seconds after release from the WhiteKnightTwo (WK2) carrier aircraft and an estimated 14 seconds before the vehicle would have reached Mach 1.4, the minimum speed at which the tail {{was designed to be}} unlocked. Telemetry, in-cockpit video and audio data confirmed that co-pilot Michael Alsbury announced [...] "unlocking" [...] as Mach 0.92 was passed and vehicle breakup occurred within the next 4 seconds. The feathering device, conceived by Scaled Composites designer Burt Rutan as a carefree and stable reentry method for recovery of SpaceShipOne, is designed to be activated outside of the thicker layers of the atmosphere before the vehicle begins its descent. The system operates by rotating the vehicle’s twin tail booms upward about the trailing edge of the wing by around 65 degrees; following reentry, the actuators rotate the booms down into the flush position for approach and landing.|$|E
