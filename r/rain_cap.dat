5000|$|For 1956, the La Femme returned, with no less fanfare; {{letters to}} dealers from Dodge’s {{marketing}} department called the La Femme a [...] "stunning success". For 1956, Dodge replaced the Heather Rose and Sapphire White scheme with a Misty Orchid and Regal Orchid color scheme. The {{interior of the}} car in 1956 did not take its cue from the 1955 model, and instead featured [...] "La Femme"-only seat patterns, headliner, interior paint and carpet. The fabrics used have proven difficult to reproduce. The seat coverings were made of a heavy white cloth with random, organic-seeming patterns of short lavender and purple loops, {{in a manner similar}} to loop-pile carpeting. The headliner cloth was heavy white fabric, with many tiny random splashes of gold paint. The carpeting was loop pile with several shades of lavender and purple. The boxes behind the seats were changed for 1956 to accommodate the rain coat, <b>rain</b> <b>cap</b> and umbrella provided with the model. Both boxes were identical this year, because there was no need to accommodate a purse, which was only offered with the 1955 La Femme.|$|E
40|$|International audienceBoth {{laboratory}} and field experiments {{were carried out}} in order to define suitable configuration ranges for the gas sampling systems (GSSs) of infrared gas analyzers (IRGAs) used in eddy covariance measurements. In the laboratory, an original dynamic calibration bench was developed {{in order to test}} the frequency attenuation and pressure drop generated by filters. In the field, three IRGAs of the same type equipped with different filters or different rain caps were installed and run and the real frequency response of the complete setup was tested. The main results are as follows. – Filters may have a strong impact on the pressure drop in the GSS and this impact increases with flow rate. – Conversely, no impact of the tested filters on cutoff frequency was found, GSSs with and without filters presenting similar cutoff frequencies. – The main limiting factor of cutoff frequency in the field was found to be the <b>rain</b> <b>cap</b> design. In addition, the impact of this design on pressure drop was also found to be noteworthy...|$|E
40|$|Several {{initiatives}} are currently emerging {{to observe the}} exchange of energy and matter between the earth's surface and atmosphere standardized over larger space and time domains. For example, the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and the Integrated Carbon Observing System (ICOS) are set to provide the ability of unbiased ecological inference across ecoclimatic zones and decades by deploying highly scalable and robust instruments and data processing. In the construction of these observatories, enclosed infrared gas analyzers are widely employed for eddy covariance applications. While these sensors represent a substantial improvement compared to their open- and closed-path predecessors, remaining high-frequency attenuation varies with site properties and gas sampling systems, and requires correction. Here, we show that components of the gas sampling system can substantially contribute to such high-frequency attenuation, but their effects can be significantly reduced by careful system design. From laboratory tests we determine the frequency at which signal attenuation reaches 50  % for individual parts of the gas sampling system. For different models of rain caps and particulate filters, this frequency falls into ranges of 2. 5 – 16. 5  Hz for CO 2, 2. 4 – 14. 3  Hz for H 2 O, and 8. 3 – 21. 8  Hz for CO 2, 1. 4 – 19. 9  Hz for H 2 O, respectively. A short and thin stainless steel intake tube was found to not limit frequency response, with 50  % attenuation occurring at frequencies well above 10  Hz for both H 2 O and CO 2. From field tests we found that heating the intake tube and particulate filter continuously with 4  W was effective, and reduced the occurrence of problematic relative humidity levels (RH [*]>[*] 60  %) by 50  % in the infrared gas analyzer cell. No further improvement of H 2 O frequency response was found for heating in excess of 4  W. These laboratory and field tests were reconciled using resistor–capacitor theory, and NEON's final gas sampling system was developed on this basis. The design consists of the stainless steel intake tube, a pleated mesh particulate filter and a low-volume <b>rain</b> <b>cap</b> in combination with 4  W of heating and insulation. In comparison to the original design, this reduced the high-frequency attenuation for H 2 O by [*]≈[*] 3 ∕ 4, and the remaining cospectral correction did not exceed 3  %, even at high relative humidity (95  %). The standardized design can be used across a wide range of ecoclimates and site layouts, and maximizes practicability due to minimal flow resistance and maintenance needs. Furthermore, due to minimal high-frequency spectral loss, it supports the routine application of adaptive correction procedures, and enables largely automated data processing across sites...|$|E

40|$|Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) fluxes {{measured}} using the eddy-covariance method capture the {{spatial and temporal}} heterogeneity of N 2 O emissions. Most closed-path trace-gas analyzers for eddy-covariance measurements have large-volume, multi-pass absorption cells that necessitate high flow rates for ample frequency response, thus requiring high-power sample pumps. Other sampling system components, including <b>rain</b> <b>caps,</b> filters, dryers, and tubing can also degrade system frequency response. This field trial tested {{the performance of a}} closed-path eddy-covariance system for N 2 O flux measurements with improvements to use less power while maintaining the frequency response. The new system consists of a thermoelectrically cooled tunable diode laser absorption spectrometer configured to measure both N 2 O and carbon dioxide (CO 2). The system features a relatively small, single- pass sample cell (200  ml) that provides good frequency response with a lower-powered pump (~  250  W). A new filterless intake removes particulates from the sample air stream with no additional mixing volume that could degrade frequency response. A single-tube dryer removes water vapor from the sample to avoid the need for density or spectroscopic corrections, while maintaining frequency response. This eddy-covariance system was collocated with a previous tunable diode laser absorption spectrometer model to compare N 2 O and CO 2 flux measurements for two full growing seasons (May 2015 to October 2016) in a fertilized cornfield in Southern Ontario, Canada. Both spectrometers were placed outdoors {{at the base of the}} sampling tower demonstrating ruggedness for a range of environmental conditions (minimum to maximum daily temperature range: − 26. 1 to 31. 6  °C). The new system rarely required maintenance. An in situ frequency response test demonstrated that the cutoff frequency of the new system was better than the old system (3. 5  Hz compared to 2. 30  Hz), and similar to that of a closed-path CO 2 eddy- covariance system (4. 05  Hz) using shorter tubing and no dryer that was also collocated at the site. Values of the N 2 O fluxes were similar between the two spectrometer systems (slope = 1. 01, r 2  =  0. 96); CO 2 fluxes as measured by the short-tubed eddy-covariance system and the two spectrometer systems correlated well (slope =  1. 03, r 2  =  0. 998). The new lower-powered tunable diode laser absorption spectrometer configuration with the filterless intake and single-tube dryer showed promise for deployment in remote areas...|$|R
40|$|Capping is a {{mandatory}} landfill closure procedure {{to isolate the}} waste from outside environment, mainly <b>rain</b> water. Clay <b>caps</b> are mostly expensive and often fail to limit entry of water into the waste by developing cracks due to desiccation. To reduce capping costs and to increase environmental benefits, an alternate capping system called ‘Phytocapping’ was trialled at Lakes Creek Road Landfill, Rockhampton, Australia. This system consists of a soil cover and vegetation. Soil cover stores water during rainfall events and the vegetation removes the stored water via transpiration. Trees also act as ‘rain interceptors’ by trapping certain proportion of the rainfall in their canopy. Soil and plants also contribute to reduced methane emission by supporting methanotrophs in their root zone. ...|$|R

One power plant in New England (Merrimack) was in Phase I. Four other plants (Newington, Mount Tom, Brayton Point, and Salem Harbor) were added under other provisions of the program.

40|$|Experimental {{landfill}} caps for semi-arid and arid climates The United States EPA Subtitle D {{municipal solid}} waste land-fill requirements specify that the permeability of a cap to a land-fill be no greater than the permeability of the underliner. In recent years {{the concept of the}} evapotranspirative (ET) cap has been developed in which the cap is designed to store all rain infiltration and re-evapotranspire it during dry weather. Con-cern at the long period required for landfilled {{municipal solid waste}} to decompose and stabilize in arid and semi-arid climates has led to an extension of the concept of the ET cap. With the infiltrate–stabilize–evapotranspire (ISE) <b>cap,</b> <b>rain</b> infiltration during wet weather is permitted to enter the underlying waste, thus accelerating the decomposition and stabilization proc-ess. Excess infiltration is then removed from both waste and cap by evaporation during dry weather. The paper describes the construction and operation of two sets of experimental ISE caps, one in a winter rainfall semi-arid climate, and the other in a summer rainfall semi-arid climate. Observation of the rainfall, soil evaporation and amount of water stored in the caps has allowed water balances to be constructed for caps of various thicknesses. These observations show that the ISE concept is viable. In the limit, when there is insufficient rain-fall to infiltrate the waste, an ISE cap operates as an ET cap...|$|R
