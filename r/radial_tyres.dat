5|$|The 1978 season saw a {{succession}} of retirements for Villeneuve, often after problems with the new Michelin <b>radial</b> <b>tyres.</b> Early in the season, he started on the front row at the United States Grand Prix West, but crashed out of the lead on lap39. Despite calls in the Italian press {{for him to be}} replaced, Ferrari persisted with him. Towards the end of the season, Villeneuve's results improved. He finished second on the road at the Italian Grand Prix, although he was penalised a minute for jumping the start, and ran second at the United States Grand Prix before his engine failed. Finally at the season-ending Canadian Grand Prix, this time at the Circuit Notre Dame Island in Montreal (a circuit that was eventually named after him) Villeneuve scored his first Grand Prix win after Jean-Pierre Jarier's Lotus stopped with engine trouble. To date, he remains the only Canadian to win his home race.|$|E
25|$|A further {{factor in}} Dunlop's decline was the {{decision}} {{during the early}} 1960s to develop cheaper textile <b>radial</b> <b>tyres</b> rather than the more durable steel-belted <b>radial</b> <b>tyres.</b> Dunlop lost market share to the Michelin company and other manufacturers marketing steel-belted tyres.|$|E

25|$|May 1975 - Introduction of the Chevette three-door Hatchback in {{base and}} L model variations. Both had an {{improved}} {{version of the}} 1,256 cc OHV engine from the Viva, with a similar four-speed gearbox, rear wheel drive, independent front suspension, rack-and-pinion steering and servo-assisted dual circuit brakes. Initial standard equipment included two-speed heater fan, <b>radial</b> <b>tyres,</b> reversing lights, heated rear window and reclining front seats.|$|E
25|$|The 2CV was {{originally}} sold in France and some European markets, {{and went on}} to enjoy strong sales in Asia, South America, and Africa. During the post-war years Citroën was very focused on the home market, which had some unusual quirks, like puissance fiscale. The management of Michelin was supportive of Citroën up to a point, and with a suspension designed to use Michelin's new <b>radial</b> <b>tyres</b> the Citroën cars clearly demonstrated their superiority over their competitors' tyres. But they were not prepared to initiate the investment needed for the 2CV (or the Citroën DS for that matter) to truly compete on the global stage. Citroën was always under-capitalised until the 1970s Peugeot takeover. The 2CV sold 8,830,679 vehicles; the Volkswagen Beetle, which was available worldwide, sold 21million units.|$|E
500|$|The LC2s {{made their}} debut at the {{beginning}} of the 1983 season, being run under the Martini Racing name and painted in the Martini & Rossi colours, as well as initially using Italian Pirelli <b>radial</b> <b>tyres.</b> [...] The first race of the season was also Lancia's home event, the 1000km of Monza. [...] The LC2 proved more powerful than the 956s, taking the pole position by nearly a second over Joest Racing's 956.

50|$|In 1966 the {{construction}} of a brand new manufacturing facility commenced in Otrokovice and the following year the first <b>radial</b> <b>tyre</b> was produced at the factory in Zlin. The factory was named Rudy Rijen (Red October) in 1953, after the October 1917 revolution in Russia.|$|R
50|$|It was Dunlop, the {{original}} company, {{who designed the}} brakes for Concorde and had also invented Maxaret, the world's first anti-lock braking system (ABS), in the early 1950s which improved stopping distances for aircraft. Michelin introduced the first aircraft <b>radial</b> <b>tyre,</b> the Air X, in 1981.|$|R
5000|$|The Pirelli Cinturato is a Pirelli-developed {{car tyre}} {{that was the}} first example of a {{wrap-around}} <b>radial</b> <b>tyre</b> structure. It was used to good effect in motorsport, and most modern tyres are based upon the design. The five-times Formula One World Champion Juan Manuel Fangio called the Pirelli Cinturato [...] "Extraordinary" [...] and raced on it many times in the remainder of his career.|$|R
500|$|The suspension, which {{controls}} the relative {{motion of the}} chassis and the wheels, {{is similar to that}} of the BT48: it features double wishbones front and rear, with the springs and dampers mounted on the chassis out of the airflow and activated by pullrods. Anti-roll bars are fitted front and rear. The BT49's disc brakes are mounted outboard, within the wheel hubs, and are activated by a single four piston brake caliper for each wheel. For most of the BT49's career, it used conventional steel brakes. Lighter reinforced carbon-carbon discs and pads, a technology that Brabham had introduced to Formula One in 1976, were used in 1981 and 1982; The wheels are of [...] diameter, although occasionally [...] wheels were used at the front. The car initially raced on Goodyear tyres, but the team had to adapt the BT49 to Michelin's new <b>radial</b> <b>tyres</b> for part of the 1981 season when Goodyear temporarily withdrew from Formula One. Slick tyres were used in dry conditions and treaded tyres in the wet.|$|E
500|$|... 1985 {{was a year}} {{in which}} Martini Racing needed to show the {{potential}} winning capabilities of the LC2 in order for Lancia to continue to fund a project that had seen limited success thus far. [...] The cars were further revised and were running on Michelin <b>radial</b> <b>tyres.</b> The season opened with an LC2 taking pole position at Mugello by 1.7 seconds ahead of the factory Porsche. [...] Although the pole position car's engine did not last, the other team car finished fourth. [...] For the 1000km of Monza, the LC2s were nearly four seconds ahead of the closest Porsche in qualifying, and led the race early on. [...] However, while Patrese and Nannini were in third place and on the same lap as the leaders, a tree fell across the track and caused the race to be stopped early. [...] On pole once again at Silverstone, one of the LC2s was in the lead of the race until a wheel bearing failure in the closing laps forced Nannini to pit, forfeiting the lead. [...] Although the LC2s did not take pole at Le Mans, they lead the race early. [...] Reliability issues again forced the team {{to drop out of the}} lead. [...] They eventually finished the race in sixth and seventh places. [...] A fuel pump failure also dropped the team out of contention at the Hockenheimring.|$|E

25|$|The city's {{industry}} {{was for a}} long time linked to the French tyre manufacturer Michelin, which created the <b>radial</b> <b>tyre</b> and grew up from Clermont-Ferrand to become a worldwide leader in its industry. For most of the 20th century, it had extensive factories throughout the city, employing up to 30,000 workers. While the company has maintained its headquarters in the city, most of the manufacturing is now done in foreign countries. This downsizing took place gradually, allowing the city to court new investment in other industries, avoiding the fate of many post-industrial cities and keeping it a very wealthy and prosperous area home of many high-income executives.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the finite element modelling of a steel belted <b>radial</b> <b>tyre</b> under static contact load using ABAQUS code. The model combines the 3 D {{parts of the}} complex tread patterns and the quasi axisymmetric part of the tyre in which the tread blocks are not included. These two sections were meshed separately and linked together using a tying algorithm implemented in the code. The fibber reinforced parts of the tyre including ply, belts, and cap ply were modelled using rebar layer embedded in the surface elements. A hyperelastic material model was {{used in conjunction with}} a linear elastic one to describe the stress-strain behaviour of rubber and reinforcing fibres, respectively. The developed model was used to simulate the 175 / 70 R 14 steel-belted <b>radial</b> <b>tyre</b> subjected to inflation and contact loads. Three belts angles were selected to examine the effect of belt angle variations on the mechanical behaviour of the tyre. In addition, the results were also compared with a similar tyre model in which a simply ribbed tread was used instead of complex tread pattern. The friction between tread surface and contact road surface was simulated using the Coulomb’s friction law. The numerical results and also the comparison of experimentally measured tyre deflection under concentrated vertical load revealed that neglecting the details of the tread blocks has very minor effect on the predicted tyre deformation. However, differences can be large enough when considering secondary or higher variables such as contact pressure, stress, and strain energies. It is also shown that a belt angle of 20 o is the best comprised value among the selected design parameters...|$|R

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} of the in-plane behaviour of a <b>radial</b> <b>tyre,</b> suitable {{to be employed}} within the simulation of aircraft braking. The model is developed {{on the basis of}} an energy-balance approach that allows the determination of the effects of braking on rolling friction and on the lever-arm of vertical load. The model is tuned and validated through the correlation between simulated and experimental results relevant to a large aircraft tyre. The method proposed is tuneable on a specific tyre using a limited number of parameters, that are those usually recorded during standard braking tests and it is extendible to the braking tests of an aircraft. This would overcome the limitations intrinsic of current tyre dynamometer facilities that are able to test large aircraft tyres over a modest range of vertical loads compared with those experienced under service conditions...|$|R
