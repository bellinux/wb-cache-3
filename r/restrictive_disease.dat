40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine the elastic equilibrium volume (Vr) of the respiratory system in patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). METHODS: Voluntary relaxed expiration from total lung capacity (TLC) was studied in three groups of subjects: seven patients with severe chronic airways obstruction (COPD), 10 normal subjects, and 15 subjects with <b>restrictive</b> <b>disease.</b> RESULTS: In the normal subjects and the patients with <b>restrictive</b> <b>disease</b> voluntary relaxed expiration from TLC stopped close to end tidal volume (FRC) and the volume expired in this manoeuvre was less than that expired in a slow vital capacity manoeuvre (SVC). In the patients with COPD the voluntary relaxed expiration continued beyond the end tidal volume (FRC) and the volume expired was not different from the SVC. Oesophageal (pleural) pressures and surface diaphragmatic EMG recordings in the patients with COPD supported the premise that relaxation was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COPD, end tidal volume (FRC) is higher than the elastic equilibrium volume, Vr, of the respiratory system. This is in contrast to patients with <b>restrictive</b> <b>disease</b> and normal subjects in whom end tidal volume (FRC) is close to Vr. This study shows that, in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Vr is at least as small as residual volume (RV) ...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{interpretation}} of lung function tests {{must be based}} on reference normal values obtained in the same population. In Chile an expert panel recommended the use of values obtained by Gutierrez et al locally, that are higher than those obtained by Knudson, for forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV 1). Aim: To analyze the clinical application of both reference values in a selected population. Material and methods: Retrospective review of 499 spirometries done in our laboratory to 285 males and 214 females, aged 4. 5 to 18 years. The reports using either Gutierrez (G) or Knudson (K) reference values were compared. The 5 th percentile was considered the inferior limit for normality. Results: The height range of patients was 110 - 178 cm (median 130, 3 rd quartile 143). Referral diagnoses were probable asthma in 349 (70 %), asthma in 119 (24 %), to rule out <b>restrictive</b> <b>disease</b> in 12 (2 %) and others 19 (4 %). FEV 1 /FVC ratio was > or = 84 % in 290 patients. Using K values, lung function was interpreted as within normal limits in 321 patients (64. 3 %), as mild obstructive disease (MOD) in 171 (34. 3 %), as combined limitation (CL) in 2, mild <b>restrictive</b> <b>disease</b> (MRD), moderate <b>restrictive</b> <b>disease</b> (MR) and severe <b>restrictive</b> <b>disease</b> (SRD) in 1 patient each. Using G values, lung function was interpreted as within normal limits in 133 patients (26. 7 %), MOD in 343 (68. 7 %), MRD in 6, CL in 4 and MR in 2. In 193 spirometries (39 %) there was lack of concordance between the interpretations using K or G values. Conclusions: There is a wide rante of variability when G or K values are used to interpret lung function in children in Chile.

Because of ever-increasing use of different materials in industries and occupational places, hypersensitivity reactions and asthma have increased significantly. Based on the increasing rate of {{symptoms such as}} cough, wheezing and other manifestations of asthma among women hairdressers, we decided to determine possible correlation between hairdressing job and asthmatic symptoms. Methods: This descriptive and analytical study was preformed on two groups: the case group consisted of 106 female hairdressers and the control group consisted of 100 housekeeper women. A questionnaire was filled and chest examination and spirometry were performed for each person. Results: The prevalence’s of obstructive and <b>restrictive</b> pulmonary <b>diseases</b> among hairdresser group were 8. 3 % and 74. 5 % respectively.

40|$|Ten {{patients}} with respiratory failure and nocturnal hypoventilation were treated {{for three to}} nine months by nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation. Four patients had chronic obstructive lung disease (median FEV 1 19 % predicted) and six restrictive chest wall disorders (median FVC 25 % predicted); eight of the patients also had cardiac failure. The median daytime arterial oxygen tension, measured before and after at least three months' treatment, increased from 6. 2 (range 5. 4 - 9. 6) to 9. 1 (7. 1 - 9. 8) kPa in those with <b>restrictive</b> <b>disease</b> (p less than 0. 05), and from 6. 0 (5. 7 - 6. 5) to 7. 1 (6. 3 - 7. 7) kPa in the four with airflow limitation (NS). Median values for arterial carbon dioxide tension over the same time fell from 8. 2 (range 6. 7 - 9. 8) to 6. 5 (6. 0 - 6. 9) kPa in the group with <b>restrictive</b> <b>disease</b> (p less than 0. 05) and from 8. 2 (7. 0 - 9. 2) to 7. 1 (4. 9 - 7. 7) kPa in those with airflow limitation (p less than 0. 02). Total sleep time while patients were using nasal positive pressure ventilation varied from 155 to 379 (median 341) minutes, and included 4 - 26 % {{rapid eye movement sleep}} (median 14 %). The percentage of monitored time during the night in which the arterial oxygen saturation was less than 80 % fell from a median (range) of 96 (3 - 100) to 4 (0 - 9) in the six {{patients with}} <b>restrictive</b> <b>disease</b> and from 100 (98 - 100) to 40 (2 - 51) in those with airflow limitation.

THE PATIENTS WERE DIVIDED INTO CATEGORIES OF OBSTRUCTIVE OR <b>RESTRICTIVE</b> <b>DISEASE</b> AND IN SUBGROUPS ON THE SEVERITY OF THE DISEASE (MILD, MODERATE AND SEVERE). THEY UNDERWENT CT SCAN OF THE THORAX (DENSITY MASK PROGRAMME FOR OBSTRUCTIVE - HRCT FOR <b>RESTRICTIVE</b> <b>DISEASE)</b> AND WERE DIVIDED ACCORDING TO THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF THE CT-FINDINGS. A COMPARISON OF THE TWO METHODS WAS DONE. IN CASES OF OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION OF THE TWO METHODS. IN CASES OF RESTRICTIVELUNG DISEASE THERE WAS NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION BETWEEN THE TWO METHODS, DUE TO THE FACT THAT HRCT WAS ABLE TO DETECT ALTERATIONS IN THE LUNG PARENCHYMA WHICH WERE IN MORE EXTENT ACCORDING TO ROENTGENOLOGICAL CTITERIA.

40|$|Abstract Restrictive {{lung disease}} is a broad term {{encompassing}} a number of conditions in which lung volumes are reduced. Dyspnea is a common clinical manifestation of restrictive lung disease and frequently becomes a prominent and disabling symptom that undermines patients' ability to function and engage in {{activities of daily living}} (especially in those with more advanced restriction). Effective management of this disabling symptom awaits a better understanding of its underlying physiology. In recent decades, our understanding of the mechanisms of dyspnea in restrictive lung disease has been improved by a small, but significant, body of research. One approach to the study of dyspnea is to identify the major qualitative dimensions of the symptom in an attempt to uncover different underlying neurophysiologic mechanisms. This article will review the existing literature on the intensity and qualitative dimensions of dyspnea during exercise in patients with restrictive lung disease. The main focus will be on interstitial lung disease (ILD), since it is the prototypical <b>restrictive</b> <b>disease.</b> </p...|$|E

During assessment, the rats were challenged with 4 and 8 % carbon dioxide (C 02) to stimulate ventilatory drive. Minute ventilation (VE) during C 02 challenge was increased in MIC-treated rats compared to controls when examined 4 months after exposure to 10 ppm MIC, suggesting a ventilation/perfusion inequality. An increase in maximum expiratory flow {{and a decrease in}} expiratory time indicated increased lung recoil in these rats. Evidence of pulmonary hypertension was observed in electrocardiograms (ECGs) and supported by postmortem analysis that showed a positive association between increased ECG abnormalities and increased right ventricular weights in the rats treated with 10 ppm MIC. At 6 months, forced expiratory flow-volume curves indicated persistent airway obstruction; however, no changes in inspiratory or expiratory resistance were evident. Decreased dynamic compliance and changes in two new measures of lung function (volume and time at zero expiratory intrapleural pressure) suggest that MICinduced lung dysfunction also exhibited elements of a <b>restrictive</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is {{significant}} research supporting {{the role of}} pulmonary rehabilitation in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). However, less is known about real-life clinical rehabilitation services. Data were analysed from a clinical pulmonary rehabilitation service provided in the UK, consisting of seven weeks' twice-weekly training and education. METHOD: A retrospective study. Baseline measures consisted of activity of daily living, mood state, spirometry, exercise tolerance using the Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (ISWT) and health status using the St George's Hospital Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Responders to pulmonary rehabilitation were defined as those with a mean reduction of four points on the SGRQ and a mean increase of 48 metres on the ISWT. RESULTS: One hundred and eight patients entered the programme and 91 completed it. All outcomes showed statistically and clinically significant change after the rehabilitation programme. Responder analysis showed that 37 % of patients achieved benefits for both the SGRQ and the ISWT. Twenty-eight per cent of patients were non-responders for both; 17 % benefited for the SGRO only and 14 % improved their exercise tolerance. Patients with <b>restrictive</b> <b>disease</b> (n = 11) showed large mean ISWT score of 98. 2 m (Standard deviation (SD) 69. 4 m) (p < 0. 01), as did patients with moderate COPD (n = 30), who scored a mean ISWT change of 77. 3 m (SD 92. 0 m) (p < 0. 01) and a SGRQ score of - 7. 6 (SD 13. 7) (p < 0. 01), and those with mild COPD (n = 12), who scored a mean ISWT change of 62. 5 m (SD 87. 4 m) (p < 0. 01) and a mean SGRQ change of - 3. 7 (SD 8. 1) (p < 0. 01). Patients with severe COPD (n = 23) showed a smaller mean change in ISWT of 32. 6 m (SD 79. 4 m) and in SGRQ of - 2. 8 (SD 7. 1). However, analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed no statistical differences between the groups (p = 0. 13). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical pulmonary rehabilitation programmes are effective for most patients.
