5|$|In the United Kingdom, the Common Cold Unit {{was set up}} by the Medical Research Council in 1946 and it {{was where}} the <b>rhinovirus</b> was {{discovered}} in 1956. In the 1970s, the CCU demonstrated that treatment with interferon during the incubation phase of <b>rhinovirus</b> infection protects somewhat against the disease, but no practical treatment could be developed. The unit was closed in 1989, two years after it completed research of zinc gluconate lozenges in the prophylaxis and treatment of <b>rhinovirus</b> colds, the only successful treatment {{in the history of the}} unit.|$|E
5|$|The genomes for {{all known}} human <b>rhinovirus</b> strains have been sequenced.|$|E
5|$|The {{common cold}} is a viral {{infection}} of the upper respiratory tract. The most commonly implicated virus is a <b>rhinovirus</b> (30–80%), a type of picornavirus with 99 known serotypes. Other commonly implicated viruses include human coronavirus (≈15%), influenza viruses (10–15%), adenoviruses (5%), human respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, and metapneumovirus. Frequently more than one virus is present. In total over 200 viral types are associated with colds.|$|E
25|$|Pleconaril {{works against}} <b>rhinoviruses,</b> which cause the common cold, by {{blocking}} a pocket {{on the surface}} of the virus that controls the uncoating process. This pocket is similar in most strains of <b>rhinoviruses</b> and enteroviruses, which can cause diarrhea, meningitis, conjunctivitis, and encephalitis.|$|R
40|$|Human enteroviruses and <b>rhinoviruses</b> are {{respiratory}} pathogens whose role {{in acute}} respiratory infection is underestimated due {{to the use of}} diagnostic procedures with poor sensitivity. To determine the prevalence of these two pathogens in the upper respiratory tract infections, a multiplex procedure was developed that both detect and differentiate <b>rhinoviruses</b> and enteroviruses. This sensitive procedure allowed the detection of both pathogens from archival material (nasal swabs) collected during the previous winters and differentiated <b>rhinoviruses</b> from enteroviruses. This procedure can be used to determine the role of these pathogens in mild or severe upper respiratory tract infections...|$|R
40|$|A method {{utilizing}} immobilized {{major group}} <b>rhinoviruses</b> and biotinylated soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 {{has been developed}} {{for the detection of}} capsid binders. Binding measurements indicate a loss in relative affinity of biotinylated soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 for <b>rhinoviruses</b> by capsid binders. This method and a new class of capsid binders are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Herd immunity, {{generated}} from previous exposure to cold viruses, {{plays an important}} role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following <b>rhinovirus</b> exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold in and of itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of the common cold {{are believed to be}} primarily related to the immune response to the virus. The mechanism of this immune response is virus specific. For example, the <b>rhinovirus</b> is typically acquired by direct contact; it binds to human ICAM-1 receptors through unknown mechanisms to trigger the release of inflammatory mediators. These inflammatory mediators then produce the symptoms. It does not generally cause damage to the nasal epithelium. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), on the other hand, is contracted by direct contact and airborne droplets. It then replicates in the nose and throat before frequently spreading to the lower respiratory tract. RSV does cause epithelium damage. Human parainfluenza virus typically results in inflammation of the nose, throat, and bronchi. In young children when it affects the trachea it may produce the {{symptoms of}} croup due to the small size of their airways.|$|E
25|$|Common cold: <b>rhinovirus,</b> coronavirus, {{respiratory}} syncytial virus, {{parainfluenza virus}} can cause {{infection of the}} throat, ear, and lungs causing standard cold-like symptoms and often pain.|$|E
50|$|Those most {{affected}} by <b>rhinoviruses</b> are infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised people.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Rhinoviruses</b> {{are known}} to be the most {{important}} common cold viruses. [...] They are ssRNA positive-strand viruses with no DNA stage, and are classified within the family Picornaviridae. [...] <b>Rhinoviruses</b> are small, with the length of approximately 30 nm, and do not contain an envelope. [...] Their icosahedral capsids contain 4 proteins: VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4. VP1, VP2, and VP3 are located on the surface of the capsid and are responsible for the antigenic diversity of <b>Rhinoviruses.</b> [...] In contrast, VP4 is located inside the virus and its function is to anchor the RNA core to the viral capsid. [...] While sharing basic properties with enteroviruses, such as size, shape, nucleic acid composition, and ether-resistance, <b>rhinoviruses</b> are distinguished from enteroviruses by having a greater buoyant density and a susceptibility to inactivation if they are exposed to an acidic environment. [...] Nevertheless, they share a common ancestor with enteroviruses.|$|R
40|$|One {{hundred and}} seventy-five <b>rhinoviruses</b> were {{isolated}} from 4 · 4 % {{of patients in}} the general practice survey and 44 from 1 · 8 % {{of children in the}} hospital survey.

25|$|The Rossmann {{cluster is}} named for Michael Rossmann, Purdue's Hanley Distinguished Professor of Biological Sciences, who is a pioneer in {{employing}} high-performance computing in research to reveal the structure of viruses and their component protein molecules. Rossmann gained worldwide attention in 1985 by determining the structure of human <b>rhinovirus</b> serotype14, HRV-14, one of about 100 known cold virus strains.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scientists}} {{are making the}} case that a vaccine against <b>rhinoviruses,</b> the predominant cause of the common cold, is achievable.|$|R
50|$|Rhinitis is {{commonly}} {{caused by a}} viral or bacterial infection, including the common cold, which is caused by <b>Rhinoviruses,</b> Coronaviruses, and influenza viruses, others caused by adenoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses other than <b>rhinoviruses,</b> metapneumovirus, and measles virus, or bacterial sinusitis, which {{is commonly}} caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Symptoms of the common cold include rhinorrhea, sneezing, sore throat (pharyngitis), cough, congestion, and slight headache.|$|R
50|$|Several {{groups of}} {{scientists}} have since then found that HBoV {{is the fourth}} most common virus in respiratory samples, behind <b>rhinoviruses,</b> respiratory syncytial virus and adenoviruses.|$|R
25|$|CAP {{in older}} infants {{reflects}} increased exposure to microorganisms, with common bacterial causes including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus. Maternally-derived syphilis {{is also a}} cause of CAP in this age group. Viruses include human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, human parainfluenza viruses, influenza and <b>rhinovirus,</b> and RSV is a common source of illness and hospitalization in infants. CAP caused by fungi or parasites is not usually seen in otherwise-healthy infants.|$|E
25|$|Hand sanitizers {{containing}} {{a minimum of}} 60 to 95% alcohol are efficient germ killers. Alcohol rub sanitizers kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, <b>rhinovirus,</b> vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi. Alcohol rub sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (3.5 Log reduction, similar to 35 Decibel reduction) of the bacteria on hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4-5 log reduction) of the bacteria on hands 1 minute after application.|$|E
25|$|Enteroviruses infect the enteric tract, {{which is}} {{reflected}} in their name. On the other hand, rhinoviruses infect primarily the nose and the throat. Enteroviruses replicate at 37°C, whereas rhinoviruses grow better at 33°C, as this is the lower temperature of the nose. Enteroviruses are stable under acid conditions and thus {{they are able to}} survive exposure to gastric acid. In contrast, rhinoviruses are acid-labile (inactivated or destroyed by low pH conditions) and that is the reason why <b>rhinovirus</b> infections are restricted to the nose and throat.|$|E
40|$|Acute {{respiratory}} viral {{infections are}} {{a major cause of}} morbidity during early childhood in developing countries. Human <b>rhinoviruses</b> are the most frequent cause of upper respiratory tract infections in humans, which can range in severity from asymptomatic to clinically severe disease. In this study we collected 4170 nasopharyngeal swabs from patients hospitalised with influenza-like illness in two Cambodian provincial hospitals between 2007 and 2010. Samples were screened for 18 respiratory viruses using 5 multiplex PCRs. A total of 11. 2 % of samples tested positive for human <b>rhinoviruses</b> (HRV). VP 4 / 2 and VP 1 regions were amplified and sequenced to study the distribution of <b>rhinoviruses</b> genotypes and species in Cambodia during this three-year period. Five novel genotypes, 2 species A, 2 species B and 1 species C were identified based on VP 1 sequences. Co-infections with other viruses were demonstrated. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

25|$|In 1897, {{foot-and-mouth disease}} virus (FMDV), the first animal virus, was discovered. FMDV is the prototypic member of the Aphthovirus genus in the Picornaviridae family. The plaque assay was {{developed}} using poliovirus; the discovery of viral replication in culture was also with poliovirus in 1949. This {{was the first time}} that infection virus had been produced from molecular building blocks in the cells. Polyprotein synthesis, internal ribosome entry sites, and uncapped mRNA were all discovered by studying poliovirus infected cells, and a poliovirus clone was the first infectious DNA clone made of an RNA virus in animals. Along with <b>rhinovirus,</b> poliovirus was the first animal virus to have its structure determined by x-ray crystallography. RNA dependent RNA polymerase was discovered in Mengovirus, a genus of picornaviruses.|$|E
25|$|Christiansen was re{{selected}} {{ahead of}} the 2014–15 season, the whole team being reselected. In September, Christiansen competed at the Norwegian Summer Championships in Steinkjer. There, he came sixth in both the sprint and the pursuit. At the season start races at Sjusjøen, Vetle came third in the sprint, but came 17th in the mass start. He was selected for the mixed relay and individual in Östersund, with a chance of getting the last place in the sprint. In the mixed relay, Christiansen again helped the Norwegians to a second-place finish. In the individual, he finished a disappointing 53rd, but was still given the last spot in the sprint due to Lars Helge Birkeland finishing 84th. In the sprint, Christiansen finished 45th despite missing only once, but he climbed thirty places in the pursuit by being {{the only one to}} hit all twenty targets, and finished 15th. Christiansen's results in Östersund were below expectations and he was not selected for {{the second round of the}} World Cup. He returned in the last round before the Christmas break, and delivered better results by finishing 30th in the sprint and 39th in the pursuit. However, he was not selected for the World Cups in Oberhof and Ruhpolding, but after both Tarjei Bø and Emil Hegle Svendsen fell ill, he was needed for the relay and sprint in Oberhof. He took the first leg in the relay, changing in fourth place. The rest of the team, Alexander Os, Johannes Thingnes Bø and Ole Einar Bjørndalen, gained the lead, but victory was snatched in a sprint finish with Anton Shipulin, and so the Norwegians finished second. Christiansen finished 67th in the sprint and decided to return to Norway for a medical examination, having been feeling tired for some time. It was revealed that he had been affected in some way by the <b>Rhinovirus,</b> but he remained unable to compete and train properly for the next six months.|$|E
500|$|Antivirals {{have been}} tested for {{effectiveness}} in the common cold; as of 2009, none had been both found effective and licensed for use. There are ongoing trials of the anti-viral drug pleconaril which shows promise against picornaviruses as well as trials of BTA-798. The oral form of pleconaril had [...] safety issues and an aerosol form is being studied. DRACO, a broad-spectrum antiviral therapy, has shown preliminary effectiveness in treating <b>rhinovirus,</b> {{as well as other}} infectious viruses.|$|E
50|$|In enteroviruses, Pleconaril {{prevents}} the virus from exposing its RNA, and in <b>rhinoviruses</b> Pleconaril {{prevents the}} virus from attaching {{itself to the}} host cell.Human <b>rhinoviruses</b> (HRVs) contain four structural proteins labeled VP1-VP4. Proteins VP1, VP2 and VP3 are eight stranded anti-parallel β-barrels. VP4 is an extended polypeptide chain on the viral capsid inner surface. Pleconaril binds to a hydrophobic pocket in the VP1 protein. Pleconaril {{has been shown in}} viral assembly to associate with viral particles.

40|$|A compound, 1 ′-methyl spiro (adamantane- 2, 3 ′-pyrrolidine) maleate, {{chemically}} {{related to}} the antiviral drug amantadine, was tested for activity in vitro against a number of human respiratory viruses. By a variety of techniques, it was shown to be active against {{a wide range of}} human and animal influenza A viruses. The effect was, however, variable and ranged from high activity against two 1957 Asian strains to no observable activity against a 1971 strain. Like amantadine, the drug did not inhibit the growth of influenza B viruses. It was also inactive against a number of paramyxoviruses. Unlike amantadine, the drug did inhibit <b>rhinoviruses,</b> but to a lesser extent than myxoviruses. The coronavirus 229 E was also sensitive to the action of the drug in vitro. Although an earlier trial in volunteers showed that, when given orally from 2 days before until 5 days after virus challenge, the drug was protective against infection with influenza A/Hong Kong/ 68 virus, a similar trial in volunteers challenged with <b>rhinoviruses</b> 2 and 9 revealed no useful activity against <b>rhinoviruses</b> in man...|$|R

2500|$|Rhinoviruses are {{the most}} common cause of the common cold; other viruses such as {{respiratory}} syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus and adenoviruses can cause them too.

2500|$|A {{picornavirus}} is a virus {{belonging to}} the family Picornaviridae, [...] a family of viruses in the order Picornavirales. Vertebrates, including humans, serve as natural hosts. Picornaviruses are nonenveloped viruses that represent a large family of small, cytoplasmic, plus-strand RNA(~7.5kb) viruses with a 30nm icosahedral capsid. Its genome {{does not have a}} lipid membrane. Picornaviruses are found in mammals and birds. There are currently 80 species in this family, divided among 35 genera. These include the Enterovirus, Aphthovirus, Cardiovirus, <b>Rhinovirus</b> and Hepatovirus genera. The viruses in this family can cause a range of diseases including paralysis, meningitis, hepatitis and poliomyelitis. Picornaviruses are in Baltimore IV class. Their genome single-stranded (+) sense RNA is that functions as mRNA after entry into the cell and all viral mRNA synthesized is of genome polarity. The mRNA encodes RNA dependent RNA polymerase. This polymerase makes complementary minus strands of RNA, then uses them as templates to make more plus strands. So, an overview of the steps in picornavirus replication are in order: attachment, entry, translation, transcription/genome replication (one and the same process), assembly and exit.|$|E
2500|$|Jeannie {{was a large}} female {{chimpanzee}} who was {{a meticulous}} groomer with a slow, intentional gait. [...] She was born in 1975, and although few details are known about her early infancy, it is established that she experienced premature separation and weaning from her mother based on her species norms (prior to age 5) and was a research subject in four biomedical research laboratories {{for the majority of}} her life. [...] She arrived into a sanctuary environment at age 22, where she lived until her death in 2007, at age 31. [...] While being used as a biomedical research subject, she was housed in a 5' x 5' x 7' cage that was suspended from the ceiling. [...] Although her species requires social bonds and interaction for health and well-being, she was housed alone. [...] She received repeated invasive tests, which included over 200 [...] "knock down" [...] anesthetizations with a dart gun, repeated vaginal washes, infection with HIV, hepatitis B and C, <b>rhinovirus,</b> and multiple internal biopsies, including of the liver, cervix, and lymph nodes. [...] Her records indicate that she experienced recurrent bouts of anorexia, resulting in severe weight loss. [...] After seven years of biomedical experimentation at the fourth laboratory, the staff reported that Jeannie had a [...] "nervous breakdown". [...] She would alternate between dissociative [...] "trance-like" [...] states to severe anxiety and aggression. [...] Upon seeing laboratory personnel or visitors dressed in white laboratory suits and masks, she would become so distressed that she would salivate excessively, urinate and defecate, and repeatedly bang her body against her cage.
