30|$|As {{in other}} {{countries}} of the West African sub-region, the cotton culture in Benin is associated {{to the use of}} huge quantities of pesticides. Recommended pesticides are not necessarily those used. Agbohessi et al. (2011) reported that endosulfan is the pesticide used the most extensively (75  %) in the Benin cotton basin through Thionex 350 EC (51  %) and Cotofan 350 EC (24  %). The use of endosulfan has been banned in Benin since 2007 due to various nuisances on the environment and several cases of human poisoning detection by the Ministry of Health (Mbaye 2008). Endosulfan was replaced by Tihan 175 O-TEQ, a mixture <b>of</b> <b>flubendiamide</b> (100  g/L) and spirotetramat (75  g/L) which represents only 1.70  % of the pesticides applied in cotton culture (Agbohessi et al. 2011). During the cotton season 2011 – 2012, Beninese authorities decided to subsidize Tihan to accelerate its adoption by the cotton producers, resulting in the coexistence of endosulfan and active ingredients of Tihan in aquatic ecosystems.|$|R
30|$|As {{mentioned}} previously (Agbohessi et al. 2013), nominal {{concentrations were}} not confirmed by chemical analyses. Precise {{measurement of the}} actual concentrations {{was considered to be}} of minor importance in these series of increasing concentrations. In addition, the half-lives <b>of</b> <b>flubendiamide</b> (20.2  days; Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority 2009) and spirotetramat (8.6 – 47.6  days; PRD 2008; U.S. EPA 2008) in neutral and acidic environments are greater than the water-renewal times applied in the present experiment. Furthermore, the active components are not highly volatile (vapor pressures: flubendiamide < 10 − 4 Pa; spirotetramat 5.6  ×  10 − 9 Pa). Endosulfan is stable at ambient temperature (CCME 2010). Although its vapor pressure (0.83  mPa at 20  °C) indicates that it is semi-volatile (Tomlin 2000), its half-life of 4 – 7  days in natural water is greater than the water-renewal time used here. We therefore did not expect a significant quantity of these compounds to be lost by volatilization during the study.|$|R

To know the molecular mechanism of fluben-diamide resistance in DBM, It was selected against flubendiamide. The LC 50 <b>of</b> <b>flubendiamide</b> was 0. 38 ppm at F 5 generation which increased to 6. 35 ppm in F 10 selected generation resulting 16. 62 fold resistance increased {{as compared to}} F 5 generation.

40|$|Objective To {{measure the}} <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> {{spinosad}} and chlorhexidine in the tissues of sheep after treatment of blowfly strike. Procedure Fourteen sheep with natural myiasis and 12 with artificial infestations of Lucilia cuprina larvae had the wool removed over their infestations and {{were treated with}} an aerosol wound dressing containing spinosad and chlorhexidine. Sheep were killed up to 14 days after treatment and <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> the chemicals measured in tissues.
