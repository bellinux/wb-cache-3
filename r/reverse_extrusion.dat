Designing its tools is usually associated with trial and error and needs great expertise and adequate experience. <b>Reverse</b> <b>extrusion</b> process is {{known as one of the}} common processes for production of hollow parts with closed ends. The significant load required in formation of a workpiece {{is one of the}} existing constraints for the <b>reverse</b> <b>extrusion</b> process. This issue becomes rather difficult especially for the parts having thin walls since its analysis using finite element softwares is exposed to some limitations. In this regard, application of artificial intelligence for prediction of load in the <b>reverse</b> <b>extrusion</b> process will not only save time and money, but also improve quality features of the product. Based on the existing data and methods suggested for variations of punching force through the <b>reverse</b> <b>extrusion</b> process, the system is trained and then performance of the system is evaluated using the test data in this paper. Efficiency of the proposed method is also assessed via comparison with the results of others...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{undrained}} {{shear strength}} (su) of fine-grained soils that {{can be measured in}} situ and in laboratory {{is one of the key}} geotechnical parameters. The unconfined compression test (UCT) is widely used in laboratory to measure this parameter due to its simplicity; however, it is severely affected by sample disturbance. The vane shear test (VST) technique that is less sensitive to sample disturbance involves a correction factor against the soil plasticity, commonly known as the Bjerrum's correction factor, Î¼. This study aims to reevaluate the Bjerrum's correction factor in consideration of a different approach and a relatively new method of testing. Atterberg limits test, miniature VST, and <b>reverse</b> <b>extrusion</b> test (RET) were conducted on 120 remolded samples. The effect of soil plasticity on {{undrained shear strength}} was examined using the liquidity index instead of Bjerrum's correction factor. In comparison with the result obatined using the Bjerrum's correction factor, the undrained shear strength was better represented when su values were correlated with the liquidity index. The results were validated by the RET, which was proven to take into account soil plasticity with a reliable degree of accuracy. This study also shows that the RET has strong promise as a new tool for testing undrained shear strength of fine-grained soils...|$|E

The {{field of}} {{high-pressure}} steel cylinders (HPSC) and vessels {{used for the}} variety of applications especially for the CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) in automotive industry is still expanding. With increasing safety requirements, a need of new techniques applied in field of HPSC structural innovations comes into place. Conventional treatment provides generally sufficient parameters of HPSC, but the long-term goal is to achieve as high as possible strength properties vs. as high as possible notch impact strength, which is currently difficult fully accessible, because of the banded structures (segregation banding) created {{during the process of}} <b>reversed</b> <b>extrusion</b> and <b>reversed</b> hot rolling...|$|R

40|$|A {{new series}} of Pgp-dependent MDR inhibitors having a N,N-bis(cyclohexanol) amine {{scaffold}} was designed {{on the basis of}} the frozen analogue approach. The scaffold chosen gives origin to different geometrical isomers. The new compounds showed a wide range of potencies and efficacies on doxorubicin-resistant erythroleukemia K 562 cells in the pirarubicin uptake assay. The most interesting compounds (isomers of 3) were studied further evaluating their action on the ATPase activity present in rat small intestine membrane vesicles and doxorubicin cytotoxicity potentiation on K 562 cells. The latter assay was performed also on the isomers of 4. The four isomers of each set present different behavior in each of these tests. Compound 3 d shows the most promising properties as it was able to completely <b>reverse</b> Pgp-dependent pirarubicin <b>extrusion</b> at low nanomolar concentration, inhibited ATPase activity at 5 x 10 (- 9) and increased the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin with a reversal fold (RF) of 36. 4 at 3 microM concentration...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{purpose is}} to design and {{evaluate}} the liposomal formulations to overcome disadvantages such as short half-life, prone to oxidation and hydrolysis, leakage and fusion in vitro. Liposomes are prepared using different techniques like lipid hydration and <b>extrusion,</b> <b>reverse</b> phase evaporation, ethanol injection, sonication, ethanol destabilization and mannitol freeze thaw methods. The formulations made using each of these methods were evaluated based on particle size and encapsulation efficiency. The particle size was measured using Dynamic light scattering and the encapsulation efficiency was measured using fluorescence spectroscopy. Finally, the suitable formulations were tested for dye release studies using SOT AX dissolution apparatus. We have determined {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each method using for preparation of liposomes. The formulations were selected which had an optimum particle size between 100 - 200 nm and the best encapsulation efficiency was around 50 - 70 %. The dye release studies showed a release between 25 - 38 days. We have developed a hybrid method for preparation of liposomes by combining lipid hydration and extrusion, sonication and mannitol freeze thaw method. The advantages from each method helped us to overcome the disadvantages of short shelf life, fusion and leakage. B. S. (Bachelor of Science...|$|R
40|$|Drug {{development}} technologies constituting innovations at {{the formulation}} {{end in the}} Pharmaceutical industry has {{received a lot of}} attention in past two decades. Drug delivery as an opportunity to extend product life cycles has indeed proved its place in the market with significant advantages of therapeutic gains as well as commercial success. Carrier technology offers an intelligent approach for drug delivery by coupling the drug to a carrier particle such as liposomes, microspheres, nanoparticles, etc. which modulates the release and absorption characteristics of the drug. Liposomes are well known to alter the bio distribution of entrapped substances by protecting the enclosed material. They are widely used as vehicles to target the specific molecule to specific organ. During the last few decades liposomes have attracted great interest as ideal models for biological membranes as well as efficient carriers for drugs, diagnostics, vaccines, nutrients and other bioactive agents. Many techniques and methodologies have involved for the manufacture of liposomes, on small and large scales, since their introduction to the scientific community around 40 years ago. This article intends to provide an overview of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} liposome preparation methods,their stability, bio distribution and their uses as drug delivery systems. The conventional method of preparing liposomes is basically for the multilamellar vesicles (MLVs). However, other methods are used to reduce the size of these MLVs to small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) so as to increase their plasma lifetime and consequently increase the possibility of achieving greater tissue localisation. Some of these methods of size reduction are sonication and high pressure extrusion. Each of these methods has its own advantages and disadvantages. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), on the other hand, are prepared mainly by detergent removal method and <b>reverse</b> phase <b>extrusion</b> technique. There are also improved pharmacokinetic properties with liposomal drugs compared to free drugs, though some formulation factors affect the release kinetics of the liposomal drugs. The review also shows that liposomes have a lot of biomedical applications and uses. They have been used in drug targeting, oral delivery of vaccines, insulin, peptides and some compounds, which are usually degraded in the gastrointestinal tract. It has also found application in topical therapy especially in the eye and lungs. Other areas of application are in cancer chemotherapy and treatment of human immunovirus (HIV) infection...|$|R
