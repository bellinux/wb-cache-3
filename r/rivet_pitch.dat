40|$|Self-piercing {{riveting}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} joining methods for construction of aluminium body structures in the automotive industry. In order to optimise vehicle mass it is desirable to use minimum flange widths, which has implications with respect to the rivet to sheet edge distance and consequently joint quality and strength. The influence of the rivet to sheet edge distance, referred as edge distance, on the quality and strength of self-piercing riveted joints was evaluated using standard aluminium alloy AA 5754 through two groups of samples. For Group 1; the edge distance changed by varying <b>rivet</b> <b>pitch,</b> whilst the samplesâ€™ width was kept constant. For Group 2; the different edge distances were obtained by changing sample width, whilst the <b>rivet</b> <b>pitch</b> remained the same. The results showed that the edge distance affects joint quality by altering distortion levels and tearing resistance. The increase in edge distance led to an increase in both lap-shear and coach-peel strength; whilst <b>rivet</b> <b>pitch</b> and specimen width play a minor role in the strength trend. An optimum edge distance and a minimum edge distance with considerations on joint quality and strength are recommended...|$|E

40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). Sheet metal parts are widely used in the {{assembly}} of aircraft. The most common method of joining sheet metal parts is through riveting. There are many parameters associated with a riveting process that {{affect the quality of}} rivets and the integrity of the final assembled product. This paper presents a study on the effect of some controllable process parameters in riveting (i. e., the sequence of riveting, distance between <b>rivets</b> (<b>pitch),</b> and gap between sheets) on the quality of riveted lap joints and the formed rivets. The study is performed on a one eight-inch nominal diameter flat head Tinner rivet and 0. 064 -in. -thick aluminum sheet. Finite element simulation is used as a means of modeling and analysis of the riveting process. Statistical design of experiment is employed to analyze the simulation data. A good combination of riveting process parameters is found which minimizes the residual stress in sheets and rivets, bulging and material growth in sheets, and which reduces the chances of postriveting clearance in a riveted lap joint...|$|R

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing EngineeringThis thesis {{presents}} {{a study on}} the effect of controllable process parameters in riveting (i. e., such as the sequence of riveting, distance between <b>rivets</b> (<b>pitch)</b> and gap between sheets) on the quality of riveted lap joint and formed rivet. The quality of a riveted lap joint is characterized by sheet metal bulging, sheet material growth, residual stress level on sheets and rivets, and post riveting clearance in the joint. The quality of a formed rivet is often determined by the geometry of its head formation. This study is to determine the best riveting sequence for riveted lap joint in sheet metal assembly with 1 / 8 " nominal diameter of flat head tinner rivet on 0. 064 " thick aluminum sheet. The study is performed using finite element simulation of riveting process. Statistical design of experiment is employed to analyze the simulation data of riveting process along with the effect of individual factors, their interactions and relationship with the quality parameters of riveted lap joint in sheet metal assembly. A good combination of riveting process parameters is found that minimizes the residual stress in sheets and rivets, bulging and material growth in sheets and reduces the chance of post riveting clearance in riveted lap joint...|$|R

Data were obtained for webs which approached a condition of pure shear stress as well as for webs with well-developed diagonal tension. The <b>rivet</b> factor (<b>pitch</b> minus diameter), divided by pitch, was varied from approximately 0. 81 to 0. 62.

Each panel congisted {{of a flat}} skin reinforced with continuous corrugations, and {{the object of the}} test was to investigate the effect of <b>rivet</b> <b>pitch</b> and arrangement, corrugation width, and skin and corrugation thickness, on the buckling and failing loads of the panels. The results indicate that for the thicknesses of skin and corrugations considered in this report, the inter-rivet buckling stress is considerably less than the stress at which the skin between rivets would buckle, when considered as an Euler strut with encastr ~ ends. 1. Introduction.

40|$|Analysis of a riveted lap joint, {{the part}} of M- 28 Skytruck fuselage, is presented. The aim of the paper is a proper choice of finite element mesh {{parameters}} (shape and density) around the rivet hole {{as well as a}} study of the influence of different sheets thickness on secondary bending. Riveting still remains the most popular method of joining metal and composite parts of the aircraft structure. During the operation (service) the severe stress concentrations and the effects such as fretting and secondary bending occur, thus reducing fatigue life. The specimen consists of two thin sheets (0. 6 and 1. 2 mm thick) stiffened with a 3 mm thick frame. The parts are connected by 14 rivets (3. 5 mm diameter) and 8 rivets (3 mm diameter). Overall specimen dimensions are following: length 682 mm, width 136 mm, <b>rivets</b> <b>pitch</b> 17 mm. The riveted joint is subjected to a tensile load. The analysis of large parts of structures like fuselages, wings or multi-row riveted specimens can be performed using global shell models. The correct stress state in global modelling can be obtained by taking into consideration the hole in the sheet, the rivet axis (as a rigid or beam element) and contact elements between the rivet and the hole as well as between the sheets. Deformation of the joint and stress state are calculated. Large difference between sheets thickness causes non-physical deformation of the rivet cross sections. Proper deformations of the joint are obtained by increasing stiffness of those sections in a thinner sheet. Results are compared with an experimental investigation and applied to estimations of specimen fatigue life...|$|R
