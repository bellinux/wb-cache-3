We {{show that the}} appropriate conductivity of the intermediate hole-injection layer PED-OT: PSS between the anode and the semiconducting polymer is critical to simultaneously achieve enhanced forward currents and rectification ratios. Among the semiconducting polymers studied (P 3 HT and PQT- 12), the diodes based on carefully purified PQT- 12 exhibited higher forward currents, higher rectification ratios, much better environmental stability, and much higher operation frequencies. A forward current density up to similar to 6 A/cm(2) at 5 V, a rectification ratio up to 2 x 10 (4) at +/- 5 V, and an operation frequency of the diode rectifier over 14 MHz were achieved with the PQT- 12 <b>rectifying</b> <b>diodes.</b> To demonstrate {{the use of the}} high-speed polymer <b>rectifying</b> <b>diodes</b> in wireless power transmission, we integrate the polymer-based vertical Schottky diode rectifier, printed antenna and capacitors on plastic substrates to demonstrate a flexible wireless power-transmission sheet that can convert a 13. 56 MHz electromagnetic wave into the dc power to drive load devices.
