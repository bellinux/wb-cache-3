5000|$|Reference part of Demonstrator K1: Part of the <b>radio</b> <b>rack</b> section. It {{is made of}} ALUMINIUM 2024-T42.|$|E
50|$|Radio CommunicationsThe CM-300/350 Series Version 2 radios are {{the latest}} {{additions}} to the Air Traffic Control (ATC) radios. Based on the FAA NEXCOM Segment 2 <b>radio</b> requirements, these <b>rack</b> mounted transmitter and receiver systems are specifically {{designed to meet the}} dynamic mission requirements of air traffic control centers, commercial airports, military air stations and range installations.|$|R
5000|$|Mechanically {{the car was}} {{identical}} to its Austin-Healey counterpart, retaining the rear suspension using quarter-elliptic leaf springs and trailing arms from the 'Frogeye'. The engine was a 948 cc A-Series with twin SU carburettors producing [...] at 5500 rpm and 53 lb.ft Nm at 3000 rpm. Brakes were 7 in drums all round. A hard top, heater, <b>radio</b> and luggage <b>rack</b> were available as factory-fitted extras.|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} the LHC {{accelerator}} being a cryogenic machine, it remains nevertheless a not negligible heat load to be removed by conventional water-cooling. About 24 MW will be taken away by demineralised water cooled directly by primary water from the LHC cooling towers placed at the even points. This paper describes the demineralised water network in the LHC tunnel including pipe diameters, lengths, water speed, estimated friction factor, head losses and available supply and return pressures for each point. It lists all water cooled equipment, highlights the water cooled cables as the most demanding equipment followed by the <b>radio</b> frequency <b>racks</b> and cavities, and by the power converters. Their main cooling requirements and their positions in the tunnel are also presented...|$|R
50|$|Fitted For Radio {{versions}} of the Champ and Humber were soon developed. This new term also represented a re-definition of the old FFW. FFR vehicles were those intended for immediate service with radios, and had the sets installed already. FFW now meant vehicles that were only partially equipped for radio use: the standard engine was suppressed against radio interference, the <b>radio</b> mounting <b>racks</b> were either installed, or their mounting brackets were attached to the vehicle body, and aerial mounts had been installed. The intention was that FFW was a low-cost addition at manufacture, but any FFW vehicle could now be rapidly upgraded to full FFR status in the field. Some FFR vehicles were supplied for specialised use (for example to the Royal Artillery) where non-standard radio equipment was to be fitted immediately, by unit workshops.|$|R
40|$|Todayâ€™s network {{control and}} {{management}} traffic {{are limited by}} their reliance on existing data networks. Fate sharing {{in this context is}} highly undesirable, since control traffic has very different availability and traffic delivery requirements. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of building a dedicated wireless facilities network for data centers. We propose Angora, a low-latency facilities network using low-cost, 60 GHz beamforming radios that provides robust paths decoupled from the wired network, and flexibility to adapt to workloads and network dynamics. We describe our solutions to address challenges in link coordination, link interference and network failures. Our testbed measurements and simulation results show that Angora enables large number of low-latency control paths to run concurrently, while providing low latency end-to-end message delivery with high tolerance for <b>radio</b> and <b>rack</b> failures...|$|R
5|$|Another {{variant of}} the Panzer IV was the Panzerbefehlswagen IV (Pz.Bef.Wg.IV) command tank. This {{conversion}} entailed the installation of additional <b>radio</b> sets, mounting <b>racks,</b> transformers, junction boxes, wiring, antennas and an auxiliary electrical generator. To {{make room for the}} new equipment, ammunition stowage was reduced from 87 to 72 rounds. The vehicle could coordinate with nearby armor, infantry or even aircraft. Seventeen Panzerbefehlswagen were built on Ausf. J chassis in August and September 1944, while another 88 were based on refurbished chassis.|$|R
500|$|The P-2, {{like the}} later P-4, was given {{stronger}} armour and two MG 15 machine guns in [...] "waist" [...] mounts {{on either side}} of the fuselage and two external bomb <b>racks.</b> <b>Radio</b> communications consisted of FuG IIIaU radios and the DB601 A-1 replaced the 601Aa powerplants. The Lotfernrohr 7 bombsights, which became the standard bombsight for German bombers, were also fitted to the P-2. The P-2 was also given [...] "field equipment sets" [...] to upgrade the weak defensive armament to four or five MG 15 machine guns. The P-2 had its bomb capacity raised to 4 ESA-250/IX vertical magazines. The P-2 thus had an empty weight of 6,202kg (13,272lb), a loaded weight increased to 12,570kg (27,712lb) and a maximum range of 2,100km (1,305mi).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{consists}} of two parts, {{the first of which}} is more general and presents the reason of particle collision research, the LHC accelerator and its main detectors (Chapter 1). It also provides information about the test stations in SM 18, the cryogenic architecture of the hall and the significant properties of the liquid helium, which make him perfect coolant for the superconducting devices (Chapter 2). The second part of this thesis presents the revamping of the SM 18 test facility. It describes the previous functional view and changes that were done. The new layout of the <b>Radio</b> Frequency Cavities <b>rack</b> and communication is also presented (Chapter 3). Chapter 4 gives the information about the software frameworks, code generation for the PLC and the synoptic production...|$|R

5000|$|Cork School of Music {{currently}} operates from {{a building}} on Union Quay in Cork, hosting {{a large number}} of Steinway pianos. The acoustics were provided by Applied Acoustic Design. It incorporates three performance spaces, the Curtis Auditorium, Stack [...] "Black Box" [...] Theatre and the main Atrium which also functions as an Art Gallery for local Artists. The building hosts a full recording suite, it also contains six lecture theatres, the full Fleischmann Library, 2 audio labs, an I.T. lab, over 50 tutoring suites, 5 medium-sized classrooms, 5 full sized classrooms each acoustically isolated to also act as practice rooms. Each classroom in the building is equipped with at least one Apple iMac, projector and a speaker system, Sennheiser Evolution <b>radio</b> microphone, Rane <b>rack</b> mixer and dual 15 band graphic EQ, and a Lab Gruppen stereo power amplifer. Under the same roof is the Off-Quay restaurant, and a common room for full-time students with large open plan areas on all floors.|$|R
