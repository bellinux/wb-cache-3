40|$|This work {{deals with}} the leaf blade {{anatomical}} structures of the broad-leaved fescue taxa, natural populations of temperate forage grasses, collected from various habitats in Central Europe. The following anatomical features were examined and quantitatively characterised: the ribs of leaves, type of the mesophyll, number of the sclerenchyma ribs, quantity of sclerenchyma tissue, presence of the colourless cells, number of bulliform cells, stomatal complexes and presence of papilla number. It was concluded that the anatomical structures and the main leaf blade characteristics of broad-leaved fescues show several differences between the taxa of Schenodorus and Drymanthele subgenus. The populations of the Schenodorus subgenus present heterogeneous mesophyll, with <b>radial</b> <b>parenchyma,</b> and colourless cells. Strong correlations exist between the bulliform cells and the quantity of sclerenchyma and papillae. The populations of Drymanthele subgenus also present heterogeneous mesophyll, {{but this is not}} evident for every taxa and populations. The <b>radial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> and the colourless cells are not specific. There is a positive correlation between the bulliform cells and the quantity of sclerenchyma. The comparative leaf anatomical analysis, could contribute to the better understanding of taxonomic and anatomical diversity in this group...|$|E
40|$|This work describes, {{analyzes}} {{and compares}} the wood anatomy of Alseis pickelii from two distinct sites in Tropical Dry Forest. One site is an exploited forest that was disturbed by deforestation {{whereas the other}} site is preserved {{and has not been}} logged since selective logging in the 1960 's. For the evaluation of wood anatomy, plant material was processed following standard techniques for light microscopy and histochemical tests. The results indicated that A. pickelii did not vary qualitatively between the two sites. The histochemical tests indicated the presence of prismatic crystals and starch in <b>radial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> of samples from both sites. Some quantitative parameters differed significantly between the two sites including: vessel frequency; vessel length and lumina area; intervessel pits; diameter, lumina, length and wall thickness of fibres; and <b>radial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> width. In general, these quantitative parameters had higher values in the samples from the exploited site, suggesting an adjustment to the more severe drought conditions there. Quantitative anatomical differences in the samples from the two sites show the influence that environmental conditions can have on wood anatomy. The observed anatomical characteristics may also be useful for taxonomic and ecological studies of this species and genus...|$|E

40|$|Heat-treated and matched boards dried at 60 °C of Scots pine (Pinus silvestris), Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Birch (Betula pubescens) were {{submerged}} into water, {{allowing for}} water absorption in the longitudinal direction during {{two weeks in}} room climate. Heat treatment was performed according to the Thermo-wood process at 170 °C and 200 °C. Boards from pine and spruce boards contained both sap- and heartwood. During water absorption computer tomography scanning, CT-scanning, was performed intermittently {{in order to measure}} the ascent of capillary water. Longitudinal water absorption in heat-treated pine sapwood was substantial larger compared to untreated sapwood. In pine heartwood the ascent of water was low in heat-treated as well as in untreated boards. Spruce showed low water absorption in sap- and heartwood in heat-treated as well as in untreated boards. In birch the water absorption was lower in heat-treated wood compared to wood dried at 60 °. SEM-studies of the anatomical microstructure, pits and pit membranes were performed on heat-treated as well as on untreated material. SEM-studies revealed damages in heat-treated and dried pine sapwood mainly in pit membranes in the fenestriform cross-field pits connecting longitudinal tracheids with <b>radial</b> ray <b>parenchyma</b> cells. These damages are believed {{to play an important role}} in explaining the differences in water absorption between pine and spruce since the piceoid cross field pits in spruce seemed to be unaffected by heat treatment. In birch no striking, visible observations were found when comparing the three different treatment temperatures that could shed light to the observed big difference in capillary water absorption.

30|$|Development of renal {{parenchyma}} proceeds by a process, {{which is}} defined as branching morphogenesis [21 – 23]. In a human kidney, the invading ureteric bud produces first the pelvis and calyceal sytems in the presumptive medulla. After formation of the ducts of Bellini, successive elongation of CD tubules in the cortex takes place. Surprisingly, during <b>radial</b> extension of <b>parenchyma,</b> a change of the branching pattern in the inner {{and then in the}} outer cortex takes place [24]. Before birth, in the nephrogenic zone of a human and rabbit kidney, this spatiotemporal program raises in elongating CD tubules bifid branches. Their endings are orientated towards the covering mesenchyme. Since a branch exhibits a dilated form, it was specified as a CD ampulla. Actual investigations show that the process of CD tubule branching depends as well on the transcription factor Foxd 1 as on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) [25]. Related survival, proliferation, and primary differentiation of branching CD cells are influenced by fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and retinoic acid (RA) [26].|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluations}} {{of the effect of}} the climatic conditions and of the intensity of forest management in the trunk of the Gmelina arborea Linn. Roxb. trees are restricted to its physical-mechanical properties and use. The present work has as objective to study the radial variations of the wood anatomy of the gmelina trees sampled in plantations of 30 sites in Costa Rica, characterized by two climatic conditions (tropical dry and humid) and three intensities of forest management (intensive, moderate and without management). The results of the analyses demonstrated the existence of radial variation of the different anatomical parameters, except for the fiber lumen diameter and multiple vessels in the wood of the gmelina trees. For the wood anatomical elements, fibers (width, lumen diameter, and length), vessels (multiple vessels, diameter and frequency) and <b>radial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> (height) relationships were observed with the climate (tropical humid and dry). The radial variations of the wood anatomical elements were, also, influenced by the management regimes of the gmelina trees...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{there is}} a great amount of genomic and transcriptomic data {{available}} about forest species, including ambitious projects looking for complete sequencing and annotation of different gymnosperm genomes [1, 2]. Pinus canariensis is an endemic conifer of the Canary Islands with re-sprouting capability and resilience against fire and mechanical damage, as result of an adaptation to volcanic environments. Additionally, this species has a high proportion of axial parenchyma compared with other conifers, and this tissue connects with <b>radial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> allowing transport of reserves. The most internal tracheids stop accumulating water [3], and get filled of resins and polyphenols synthesized by the axial parenchyma; this is the so-called ?torch-heartwood? [4], which avoids decay. This wood achieves very high prices due to its particular resistance to rot. These features make P. canariensis an interesting model species for the analysis of these developmental processes in conifers. In this study we aim to perform a complete transcriptome annotation during xylogenesis in Pinus canariensis, using next-generation sequencing (NGS) -Roche 454 pyrosequencing-, in order to provide a genomic resource for further analysis, including expression profiling and the identification of candidate genes for important adaptive features...|$|E
40|$|The tree Gmelina arborea {{has been}} widely {{introduced}} in Costa Rica for commercial purposes. This new conditions for melina cause variations on anatomy in secondary xylem of the trees growing in plantations. The objective of the present research {{was to determine the}} variation in the anatomy of xylem caused by the ecological conduction variation. Dimensions of fiber, axial parenchyma percentage of cross sections, parameters of vessels and the ray were measured. The results showed that some anatomical characteristics remained stable despite variations of ecological conditions, especially <b>radial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> and anatomical features which were less affected by the altitude. On the other hand, the vessels, axial parenchyma and fiber were less stable because they were affected significantly by the longitude, latitude, altitude and precipitation. Latitude significantly affected vessel percentage, length and diameter of the fiber and lumen. Longitude affected vessel percentage and fiber diameter. Altitude had a significant correlation with the amount of cells at my height. Annual average precipitation affected vessel percentage and diameter, not only of the fiber, but also of the lumen. These results suggest that the new growth conditions of G. arborea trees in Costa Rica have produced an anatomic adaptation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{the ability of a}} {{scientific}} strategy to compute the shrinkage behaviour of any oak sample, regardless of its origin, density, growth ring, etc. This approach uses the description of the actual oak structure at the annual ring level (i. e. the spatial organisation of the <b>radial</b> ray-cells, fibre, <b>parenchyma</b> areas and large vessels), to evaluate its shrinkage/swelling and elastic properties in the transverse directions. For the shrinkage properties, computed results were compared with experimental values measured on a set of samples depicting a very large diversity of anatomical patterns. The accuracy of our prediction is about 5 % in the tangential direction and 20 % in the radial direction, which is much better than statistical models over a wide range of variables. These results are discussed and a few microscopic observations with ESEM allow explanation of anomaly points of behaviour to be formulated. Such good results could allow this approach to be used to study the influence of growing conditions or of global changes upon physical wood properties...|$|R
40|$|Stem {{and leaf}} anatomy of Dirachma socotrana, an endemic species from Socotra, is {{described}} in detail. The diffuse porous to semi-ring-porous wood is characterized by solitary vessels and vessels in short radial multiples with a tendency for oblique/radial vessel arrangement, simple vessel perforations, vascular tracheids, nonseptate fibers with simple to minutely bordered pits mainly confined to <b>radial</b> walls, axial <b>parenchyma</b> which is scanty paratracheal and in 1 - 2 -seriate marginal bands, and mainly 1 - 2 -seriate heterocellular rays. The inner bark shows stratified fiber groups; the outer bark has flaring rays. The dorsi-ventral leaves typically have an indumentum of small, unicellular hairs, anomocytic slomata, an adaxial epidermis largely composed of periclinally divided mucilage cells. The petiole and midrib vascular bundle is typically composed of a simple are-shaped strand. Prismatic crystals are common in the wood, bark, pith, and leaf. The systematic position of the monotypic family Dirachmaceae in a newly defined Resales sensu Angiosperm Phylogeny Group was established recently {{on the basis of}} molecular data and confirmed by ovule and seed characters.

40|$|Comprehensive and {{systematic}} transcriptome profiling provides valuable insight into biological and developmental processes that occur throughout {{the life cycle}} of a plant. We have enhanced our previously published microarray-based gene atlas of maize (L.) inbred B 73 to now include 79 distinct replicated samples that have been interrogated using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The current version of the atlas includes 50 original array-based gene atlas samples, a time-course of 12 stalk and leaf samples postflowering, and an additional set of 17 samples from the maize seedling and adult root system. The entire dataset contains 4. 6 billion mapped reads, with an average of 20. 5 million mapped reads per biological replicate, allowing for detection of genes with lower transcript abundance. As the new root samples represent key additions to the previously examined tissues, we highlight insights into the root transcriptome, which is represented by 28, 894 (73. 2 %) annotated genes in maize. Additionally, we observed remarkable expression differences across both the longitudinal (four zones) and <b>radial</b> gradients (cortical <b>parenchyma</b> and stele) of the primary root supported by fourfold differential expression of 9353 and 4728 genes, respectively. Among the latter were 1110 genes that encode transcription factors, some of which are orthologs of previously characterized transcription factors known to regulate root development in (L.)

40|$|When the four-week-old woody stem of Prunus jamasakura {{was grown}} under {{simulated}} microgravity condition on a three-dimensional clinostat, it bent at growth, and width of its secondary xylem decreased {{due to the}} reduction of fiber cell numbers and a smaller microfibril angle in the secondary cell wall, as reported in our previous paper.

In this study, morphological changes of the tissues and cells were microscopically observed. Disorder was found in the concentric structure of tissues that organize the stem. The radial arrangement of the cells was also disturbed in the secondary xylem, and in the secondary phloem secondary cell walls of the bast fiber cells were undeveloped. These findings suggest that differentiation and development of the secondary xylem and the bast fiber cells are strongly controlled by terrestrial gravity. These tissue and cells functions to support the stem under the action of gravity. Furthermore, clinorotation induced disorder in the straight joint of vessel elements and the lattice-like structure of <b>radial</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells, which is responsible for water transportation and storage, respectively.

40|$|This review {{examines}} {{the roles that}} <b>radial</b> and axial <b>parenchyma</b> (RAP) plays against fungal pathogens in the secondary xylem of wood {{within the context of}} the CODIT model (Compartmentalization of Decay in Trees), a defense concept first conceived in the early 1970 s by Alex Shigo. This model, simplistic in its design, shows how a large woody perennial is highly compartmented. Anatomical divisions in place at the time of infection or damage, (physical defense) alongside the ‘active’ response by the RAP during and after wounding work together in forming boundaries that function to restrict air or decay spread. The living parenchyma cells play a critical role in all of the four walls (differing anatomical constructs) that the model comprises. To understand how living cells in each of the walls of CODIT cooperate, we must have a clear vision of their complex interconnectivity from a three-dimensional perspective, along with knowledge of the huge variation in ray parenchyma (RP) and axial parenchyma (AP) abundance and patterns. Crucial patterns for defense encompass the symplastic continuum between both RP and AP and the dead tissues, with the latter including the vessel elements, libriform fibers, and imperforate tracheary elements (i. e., vasicentric and vascular tracheids). Also, the heartwood, a chemically altered antimicrobial non-living substance that forms the core of many trees, provides an integral part of the defense system. In the heartwood, dead RAP can play an important role in defense, depending on the genetic constitution of the species. Considering the array of functions that RAP are associated with, from capacitance, through to storage, and long-distance water transport, deciding how their role in defense fits into this suite of functions is a challenge for plant scientists, and likely depends on a range of factors. Here, we explore the important role of RAP in defense against fungal pathogens and the trade-offs involved from a viewpoint for structure-function relations, while also examining how fungi can breach the defense system using an array of enzymes in conjunction with the physically intrusive hyphae...|$|R
