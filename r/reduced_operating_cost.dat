40|$|The {{monopropellant}} {{community has}} been pursuing low-toxicity alternatives to hydrazine {{for the past two}} decades. One of such “green” monopropellants, known as AF-M 315 E, has caught attention of many by offering both improved performance and handling safety. A 0. 5 N-class, AF-M 315 E micro thruster was recently developed by Busek that can deliver 3 ̆e 220 sec vacuum Isp. Both steady-state and pulsed firings were demonstrated. The thruster, when cold, requires a small amount of pre-heating power to start which is no more than 12 W or an equivalent of 1. 6 W-Hr energy input. The thruster is complemented by a novel piezoelectric microvalve that needs less than 200 mW to operate and weighs a mere 67 g. The valve features an all-welded, all-titanium wetted design for long-term propellant compatibility. It is rated for 1200 sccm GN 2 max flow and 1. 5 × 10 - 4 sccm GN 2 leak rate. The valve passed environmental testing before being integrated into the thruster, and together they demonstrated a minimum impulse bit of 0. 036 N-sec. Busek is currently developing a 1 U CubeSat propulsion system centered on the integrated 0. 5 N thruster and microvalve. The system is designed to be self-contained and fully loaded with propellant, which allows for simple spacecraft integration and <b>reduced</b> <b>operating</b> <b>cost...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This project {{concentrates}} on the implementation and operation of a multi source hybrid Wind/Photovoltaic stand alone system with energy management strategy using neural networks. Hybrid energy system is an excellent solution for electrification of remote rural areas where the grid extension is difficult and not economical. Hybrid Wind/PV systems are highly efficient and require very low maintenance. An average model of a hybrid wind-photovoltaic generating system has been presented. The main objective is to provide 24 hrs demand quality power in remote communities. The method of investigation concerns with {{the definition of the}} system topology, interconnection of the various sources with maximum transfer of energy, optimum control and energy management. The proposed energy management strategy was simulated in MATLAB/Simulink with the Neural Network controller. The optimal transfers of power from the sources are based on power, voltage and current control was done in order to regulate the DC bus voltage to a fixed value. The various models with the output waveforms are represented and discussed. The role of Neural Network controller is to interconnect the system for optimal performance based on expected wind, solar irradiations and battery voltage. The Neural Network controller takes the input from Solar (irradiation), Wind (speed) and the battery status of charge and controls the respective subsystem which formulates into different operational modes of energy management and the proposed system have very high accuracy and efficient operation which leads to a <b>reduced</b> <b>operating</b> <b>cost...</b>|$|E
40|$|Purpose - This {{research}} in this paper aims to investigate and extend the trust-relationship commitment model to an internet banking setting by adding attraction as a new factor. Design/methodology/approach - The paper shows that in testing whether attraction {{might be related to}} belief in and use of the internet banking, this research sampled 276 bank customers' responses via a cross-sectional survey in Doha, Qatar. Findings - The findings in the paper indicate that both trust and attraction have significant positive impact on relationship commitment with attraction having a strong positive effect, with communication representing the most important determinant of attraction and having a significant positive relationship with both trust and attraction. Practical implications - The paper shows that, from the managerial perspective, it is necessary for bankers and policy makers to know the relationship between trust and attraction because their influence on the actual commitment is different The findings of this study suggest that, in order to develop trust and to attract more users to internet banking, {{it is not going to}} be enough to make the system easy to interact with. It is of paramount importance for banks to develop secured and private internet banking systems that are trustworthy, for their users. Thus, management attention might be fruitfully focused on the development of such beliefs on the part of the users. Thus, the internet banking authorities should employ training and promotion approaches to develop customers' beliefs of shared value, communication, and opportunistic behavior, which in turn will influence or attract the customers' behavioural intention to utilize internet banking services. Similarly, banks may consider offering a low-cost service by passing on some of their gains from <b>reduced</b> <b>operating</b> <b>cost</b> to customers. This may lead to better customer loyalty towards the service. Originality/value - The paper finds that attraction as an additional factor in a trust-relationship commitment model has not been examined before. Thus, researchers should include attraction in online relationship banking models along with other relationship effects. Also, bankers and policy makers need to develop trust among the customers and to realize that more favorable communication environments must be created to attract customers and to make them more committed to using online banking transactions over the internet...|$|E
