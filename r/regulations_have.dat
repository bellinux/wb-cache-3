5|$|Bulk cargo {{can be very}} dense, corrosive, or abrasive. This {{can present}} safety problems: cargo shifting, {{spontaneous}} combustion, and cargo saturation can threaten a ship. The use of ships that are old and have corrosion problems {{has been linked to}} a spate of bulker sinkings in the 1990s, as have the bulker's large hatchways, important for efficient cargo handling. New international <b>regulations</b> <b>have</b> since been introduced to improve ship design and inspection, and to streamline the process of abandoning ship.|$|E

5|$|In the United States and the European Union, {{since the}} early 1990s <b>regulations</b> <b>have</b> been in place that are {{designed}} to prevent shellfish from contaminated waters entering the food chain. This has meant that there is sometimes a shortage of regulated shellfish, with consequent higher prices. This has led to illegal harvesting and sale of shellfish on the black market, which can be a health hazard.|$|E
5|$|Often {{compared}} to San Francisco {{due to the}} hilly terrain and steep maze of residential streets, housing in St. John's is typically painted in bright colours. The city council has implemented strict heritage regulations in the downtown area, including restrictions on the height of buildings. These <b>regulations</b> <b>have</b> caused much controversy over the years. With the city experiencing an economic boom a lack of hotel rooms and office space has seen proposals put forward that {{do not meet the}} current height regulations. Heritage advocates argue the current regulations should be enforced while others believe the regulations should be relaxed to encourage economic development.|$|E
5|$|Recent Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) <b>regulations</b> <b>have</b> {{given rise}} to a new variety of steel known as Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS). This {{material}} is both strong and ductile so that vehicle structures can maintain their current safety levels while using less material. There are several commercially available grades of AHSS, such as dual-phase steel, which is heat treated to contain both a ferritic and martensitic microstructure to produce a formable, high strength steel. Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steel involves special alloying and heat treatments to stabilize amounts of austenite at room temperature in normally austenite-free low-alloy ferritic steels. By applying strain, the austenite undergoes a phase transition to martensite without the addition of heat. Twinning Induced Plasticity (TWIP) steel uses a specific type of strain to increase the effectiveness of work hardening on the alloy.|$|E

5|$|Andalusians only {{began to}} be {{exported}} from Spain in 1962. The first Andalusians were imported into Australia in 1971, and in 1973 the Andalusian Horse Association of Australasia was formed for the registration of these Andalusians and their offspring. Strict quarantine guidelines prohibited the importation of new Andalusian blood to Australia for many years, but since 1999, <b>regulations</b> <b>have</b> been relaxed {{and more than half}} a dozen new horses have been imported. Bloodines in the United States also rely on imported stock, and all American Andalusians can be traced directly to the stud books in Portugal and Spain. There are around 8,500 animals in the United States, where the International Andalusian and Lusitano Horse Association (IALHA) registers around 700 new purebred foals every year. These numbers indicate that the Andalusian is a relatively rare breed in the United States. In 2003, there were 75,389 horses registered in the stud book, and they constituted almost 66 percent of the horses in Spain. Breed numbers have been increasing during the 21st century. At the end of 2010, a total of 185,926 Pura Raza Espa√±ola horses were recorded in the database of the Spanish Ministerio de Medio Ambiente, y Medio Rural y Marino. Of these, 28,801 or about 15% were in other countries of the world; of those in Spain, 65,371 or about 42% were in Andalusia.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{the theory}} of banking <b>regulation</b> <b>has</b> {{undergone}} important changes.

As a result, the markets and institutions that must be regulated have changed substantially over time. At the same time, <b>regulation</b> <b>has</b> evolved, as the regulators have learned the lessons from the recent spat of banking crises. As a consequence of these experiences, <b>regulation</b> <b>has</b> become more sophisticated, with the introduction of capital requirements and more complex restrictions on operating procedures.
