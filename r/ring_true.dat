25|$|The {{most famous}} {{aspect of the}} {{production}} is Craig's use of a single, plain set that varied from scene to scene by means of large, abstract screens that altered {{the size and shape}} of the acting area. There is a persistent theatrical myth that these screens were impractical and fell over during the first performance. This myth may be traced to a passage in Stanislavski's My Life in Art (1924); Craig demanded that Stanislavski delete the story and Stanislavski admitted that the incident occurred only during a rehearsal. He eventually provided Craig with a sworn statement that the mishap was due to an error by the stage-hands and not the design of Craig's screens. The screens had been built ten feet taller than Craig's designs specified, which may have also contributed to the mishap. Craig had envisaged specially costumed, visible stage-hands to move the screens, but Stanislavski had rejected the idea. This forced a curtain close and delay between scenes, which disrupted the sense of fluidity and movement inherent to Craig's conception. The different arrangements of the screens for each scene were used to provide a spatial representation of Hamlet's state of mind or to underline a dramaturgical progression across a sequence of scenes, as visual elements were retained or transformed. In terms of costume design there were also differences between the two artists. For example, in the scene containing the dumb show Craig wished for the Actors to wear oversized masks, but Stanislavski despised this idea as it did not <b>ring</b> <b>true</b> to a realistic style of acting. Eventually there was a compromise which allowed the actors to wear makeup along with extravagant beards and wigs (Innes 158).|$|E

The band turned down the advances of major label RCA Records in favor of I.R.S., with whom it signed a contract in May 1982. I.R.S. released Chronic Town that August as its first American release.

[...] David Hiltbrand from Star Tribune gave a negative review of the EP saying that [...] "things go downhill as soon as Jane Lynch starts camping up the spoken portion of 'Vogue'.

[...] Lewis described the album's style as [...] "classic songs with a contemporary edge", containing R and [...] "fresh pop" [...] styles, ballads and [...] "soulful up-tempo numbers". It has an American style, with some electronic 1980s sounds; however, the songs are not beat-driven or following the latest trends, but are songs that can be performed acoustically.|$|E

2500|$|Despite this, {{some people}} wrote in commenting on and {{requesting}} stories dealing with current {{issues in the}} Catholic Church such as the abuse cases.

[...] Or, when one of Sister Shannon's fellow nuns asked why they could not receive the Magic Priests' training in the supernatural, she replied that it was for the same reason the Church forbids the ordination of women, something that causes controversy within the fictional Church of Warrior Nun Areala as it does in the real Church.|$|E
2500|$|Next Binoche {{traveled}} to the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival for the premiere of Breaking and Entering, her second film with Anthony Minghella in the director's chair, based on his first original screenplay since his break-through film Truly, Madly, Deeply (1991). In Breaking and Entering, Binoche played a Bosnian refugee living in London, while Jude Law co-starred as a well-to-do businessman drawn into her life via an act of deception. In preparation for her role, Binoche travelled to Sarajevo where she met women who had survived the war of the 1990s. Lushly photographed by Benoît Delhomme, Breaking and Entering portrays intersecting lives amongst the flux of urban renewal in inner-city London. Despite the fact that Binoche was praised for her performance, the film did not <b>ring</b> <b>true</b> for critics and failed to find an audience. In a review in Variety, Todd McCarthy writes that, [...] "Binoche, physically unchanged as ever, plays Amira's controlled anguish with skill". Breaking and Entering also featured Robin Wright, Vera Farmiga, Juliet Stevenson, Rafi Gavron and Martin Freeman.|$|E

2500|$|In 1802, {{while serving}} as President of the United States, Thomas Jefferson wrote to artist Charles Willson Peale that his concept of the new {{university}} would be [...] "on the most extensive and liberal scale that our circumstances would call for and our faculties meet," [...] and that it might even attract talented students from [...] "other states to come, and drink of the cup of knowledge". Virginia was already home to the College of William and Mary, but Jefferson lost all confidence in his alma mater, partly because of its religious nature – it required all its students to recite a catechism – and its stifling of the sciences. Jefferson had flourished under William and Mary professors William Small and George Wythe decades earlier, but the college was {{in a period of}} great decline and his concern became so dire by 1800 that he expressed to British chemist Joseph Priestley, [...] "we have in that State, a college just well enough endowed to draw out the miserable existence to which a miserable constitution has doomed it." [...] These words would <b>ring</b> <b>true</b> some seventy years later when William and Mary fell bankrupt after the Civil War and the Williamsburg college was shuttered completely in 1881, later being revived only in a limited capacity as a small college for teachers until the twentieth century.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked whether}} the series would feel as [...] "adult" [...] as Jessica Jones, Colter replied, [...] "if you think Jessica is adult then we’re still keeping up with that pace ... we’ll {{continue}} along those lines of PG-16+". On whether Luke Cage would address current race issues, including Black Lives Matter, given the character's past (a wrongfully imprisoned black man), Colter said, [...] "this {{is not necessarily the}} platform to hit it head on" [...] but [...] "the things that he's going through will <b>ring</b> <b>true</b> {{for a lot of people}} in law enforcement" [...] and on the street. Loeb said on the issue, [...] "Luke Cage, when he came on the scene in the early 70s was for all intents and purposes the first black superhero. Given what’s going on present day, it just resonates." [...] Coker stated that Cage is [...] "someone that the community can touch and go to", adding, [...] "There’s never been a time in history where having a bulletproof black man" [...] has been so important. Luke Cage was also the first MCU property to use the word [...] "nigger" [...] or [...] "nigga", with Marvel having complete trust in Coker's use of it: the word is used casually in the series, though some characters, including Cage, prefer not to use it. Coker said the intent was never to use it [...] "in a way where it's flippant. I used it from the standpoint of, if we were going to eavesdrop on a conversation with African American people, with nobody else around, when would this word be used and how would it get used." [...] Coker also likened the use in the series to [...] "the way music used to treat it," [...] not having it be [...] "every other word of every other chorus, because at that point, it just gets silly." ...|$|E
2500|$|O'Donnell {{condemned}} {{many of the}} Bush administration's policies, {{especially the}} war in Iraq and the resulting occupation. She also questioned the official explanation {{for the destruction of}} the World Trade Center, and stating in one episode, [...] "I do believe that it's {{the first time in history}} that fire has ever melted steel". She consistently mentioned recent military deaths and news about the war, and criticized the U.S. media for its lack of attention to these issues compared to media coverage throughout the world. This led to a series of heated exchanges with co-host Hasselbeck, as well as [...] "the most-discussed moment of her professional life." [...] On May 17, 2007, O'Donnell rhetorically asked, [...] "655,000 Iraqi civilians dead. Who are the terrorists? ... if you were in Iraq and another country, the United States, the richest in the world, invaded your country and killed 655,000 of your citizens, what would you call us?" [...] Conservative commentators criticized O'Donnell's statements, saying that she was comparing American soldiers to terrorists. On May 23, 2007, a heated discussion ensued, in part, because of what O'Donnell perceived as Elisabeth Hasselbeck's unwillingness to defend O'Donnell from the criticisms; O'Donnell asked Hasselbeck, [...] "Do you believe I think our troops are terrorists?" [...] Hasselbeck answered in the negative but also stated [...] "Defend your own insinuations." [...] O'Donnell was hurt and felt Hasselbeck had betrayed her friendship: [...] "there's something about somebody being different on TV toward you than they are in the dressing room. It didn't really <b>ring</b> <b>true</b> for me." [...] O'Donnell stated that Republican pundits were mischaracterising her statements and the right-wing media would portray her as a bully, attacking [...] "innocent pure Christian Elisabeth" [...] whenever they disagreed. O'Donnell decided to leave the show that day, but afterwards stated that the reason was not the argument itself, but rather the fact that she saw on the studio monitor that the camera had shown a split screen, with her and Hasselbeck on either side. O'Donnell felt that the show's director and producer [...] "had to prepare that in advance [...] I felt there was setup egging me into that position. The executive producer and I did not gel." [...] O'Donnell and ABC agreed to cut short her contract agreement on May 25, 2007. ABC News reported that her arguments with Hasselbeck brought the show its best ratings ever.|$|E
