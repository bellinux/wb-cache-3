The full-scale manned OV spaceship was said to be derived from this, although ISRO's published concept showed a more elongated conical shape than the SRE.|$|E
50|$|After Samos 3, it {{was decided}} to abandon the Program 101/101A {{satellites}} entirely and switch to a more conventional film <b>recovery</b> <b>capsule,</b> since the one successful mission had not proven the viability of the electro-optical camera system. While the 101/101A satellites separated from the Agena in orbit, the 101B would remain attached and would use it for orbital maneuvers and also deorbiting the film capsule {{at the end of the}} mission.|$|E

However, g-loads of up to 8-gs make this vehicle unsuitable for critical medical situations.|$|E

50|$|Discoverer 2 (April 14) {{carried a}} <b>recovery</b> <b>capsule</b> {{for the first}} time and was also the first {{satellite}} to be placed into polar orbit. The main bus performed well, but the capsule recovery failed. It apparently came down near Svalbard, Norway, but was never found. Rumors persist that the Soviets recovered the capsule themselves, but there is no evidence of this and in any case, there would have been little information they could have gained from the small test payload. At this early phase, program planners were not even sure if the Thor/Agena had enough lift capacity to orbit a camera package. It is more likely that Discoverer 2's capsule sank into the ocean.|$|E

40|$|Biosatellite B was {{launched}} from Cape Kennedy, Florida, on a two-stage DELTA launch vehicle at 6 : 04 p. m. on 7 September, 1967. Approximately nine {{minutes later the}} 435 kg spacecraft biological laboratory was placed into a satisfactory 315 km near-circular earth orbit, successfully separated from the launch vehicle's second stage and was designated Biosatellite II. The scientific payload consisting of thirteen selected general biology and radiation experiments were subjected to planned, carefully controlled environmental conditions during 45 hours of earth-orbital flight. The {{decision was made to}} abbreviate the scheduled 3 -day mission by approximately one day because of a threatening tropical storm in the recovery area, and a problem of communication with the spacecraft from the tracking stations. Highest priority was placed on recovery which was essential to obtain the scientific results on all the experiments. The operational phase of the mission came to a successful conclusion with the deorbit of the <b>recovery</b> <b>capsule,</b> deployment of the parachute system and air recovery by the United States Air Force. The 127 kg <b>recovery</b> <b>capsule</b> was returned to biology laboratories at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, for disassembly and immediate inspection and analysis of the biological materials by the experimenters. It was evident immediately that the quality of the biology was excellent and this fact gave promise of a high return of scientific data. The environmental conditions provided to the experimental material in the spacecraft, provisions for experimental controls, and operational considerations are presented as they relate to interpretation of the experimental results...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a {{microsatellite}} and the related deployable <b>recovery</b> <b>capsule.</b> The aero-brake is folded at launch and deployed in space {{and is able to}} perform a de-orbiting controlled re-entry. This kind of capsule, with a flexible, high temperature resistant fabric, thanks to its lightness and modulating capability, can be an alternative to the current “conventional” recovery capsules. The present authors already analyzed the trajectory and the aerodynamic behavior of low ballistic coefficient capsules during Earth re-entry and Mars entry. In previous studies, aerodynamic longitudinal stability analysis and evaluation of thermal and aerodynamic loads for a possible suborbital re-entry demonstrator were carried out in both continuum and rarefied regimes. The present study is aimed at providing preliminary information about thermal and aerodynamic loads and longitudinal stability for a similar deployable capsule, as well as information about the electronic composition of the plasma sheet and its possible influence on radio communications at the altitudes where GPS black-out could occur. Since the computer tests were carried out at high altitudes, therefore in rarefied flow fields, use of Direct Simulation Monte Carlo codes was mandatory. The computations involved both global aerodynamic quantities (drag and longitudinal moment coefficients) and local aerodynamic quantities (heat flux and pressure distributions along the capsule surface). The results verified that the capsule at high altitude (150 km) is self-stabilizing; it is stable around the nominal attitude or at zero angle of attack and unstable around the reverse attitude or at 180 deg angle of attack. The analysis also pointed out the presence of extra statically stable equilibrium trim points...|$|E
40|$|NASA and Japan's Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) {{have agreed}} to {{cooperate}} on the first mission to collect samples {{from the surface of}} an asteroid and return them to Earth for in-depth study. The MUSES-C mission will be launched on a Japanese MV launch vehicle in January 2002 from Kagoshima Space Center, Japan, toward a touchdown on the asteroid Nereus in September 2003. A NASA-provided miniature rover will conduct in-situ measurements on the surface. The asteroid samples will be returned to Earth by MUSES-C via a parachute-borne <b>recovery</b> <b>capsule</b> in January 2006. NASA and ISAS will cooperate on several aspects of the mission, including mission support and scientific analysis. In addition to providing the rover, NASA will arrange for the testing of the MUSES-C re-entry heat shield at NASA/Ames Research Center, provide supplemental Deep Space Network tracking of the spacecraft, assist in navigating the spacecraft and provide arrangements for the recovery of the sample capsule at a landing site in the U. S. Scientific coinvestigators from the U. S. and Japan will share data from the instruments on the rover and the spacecraft. They will also collaborate on the investigations of the returned samples. With a mass of about I kg, the rover experiment will be a direct descendant of the technology used to build the Sojourner rover. The rover will carry three science instruments: a visible imaging camera, a near-infrared point spectrometer and an alpha X ray spectrometer. The solarpowered rover will move around the surface of Nereus collecting imagery data which are complimentary to the spacecraft investigation. The imaging system will be capable of making surface texture, composition, and morphology measurements at resolutions better than 1 cm. The rover will transmit this data to the spacecraft for relay back to Earth. Due to the microgravity environment on Nereus, the rover has been designed to right itself in case it flips over. Solar panels on all sides of the rover will ensure that enough power will always be available to the rover to activate the motors needed to turn over. Posable struts will allow the rover to position its chassis such that the camera can be pointed straight down at the surface or straight up at the sky. The presentation will describe the mission, scientific objectives and current state of the rover in detail...|$|E

40|$|Powder {{compacts}} of HgO {{were subjected}} to explosively-generated shock-wave loading in Sandia Bear fixtures and recovered for analysis. Although XRD powder spectra show only the orthorhombic form of HgO in both the as-received and recovered samples, XRD line profiles and TEM indicate up to {{an order of magnitude}} increase in crystallite size. Magnetic data reveal a superconducting transition below 4. 2 K that is attributed to metallic {alpha}-Hg formed by a partial, shock-induced decomposition of the HgO, consistent with TEM identification of {alpha}-Hg particles using a cold stage. In addition, paramagnetic impurities present in the as-received HgO powder appear to be partially converted to a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic phase that dominates the magnetic properties of the recovered powder. The amounts of both the superconducting and ferromagnetic phases vary strongly with position within the shock <b>recovery</b> <b>capsules...</b>|$|R
