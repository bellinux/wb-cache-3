2500|$|This area {{is related}} to {{corporate}} finance in two ways. Firstly, firm exposure to business and market risk {{is a direct result}} of previous capital financial investments. Secondly, both disciplines share the goal of enhancing, or preserving, firm value. [...] There is a fundamental debate [...] relating to [...] "Risk Management" [...] and shareholder value. Per the Modigliani and Miller framework, hedging is irrelevant since diversified shareholders are assumed to not care about firm-specific risks, whereas, on the other hand hedging is seen to create value in that it reduces the probability of financial distress. A further question, is the shareholder's desire to optimize risk versus taking exposure to pure risk (a <b>risk</b> <b>event</b> that only has a negative side, such as loss of life or limb). The debate links the value of risk management in a market to the cost of bankruptcy in that market.|$|E

40|$|Cost overrun in any sector brings bad {{image to}} the {{organization}} and unrest to the professionals. The cost overrun can be resulted either due to <b>risk</b> <b>events</b> or non <b>risk</b> <b>events.</b> Possible non <b>risk</b> <b>events</b> in bridge projects are the scope changes, design changes, quantity increase and variations. However those non <b>risk</b> <b>events</b> produce a justification to the additional cost incurred and it enhance {{the value of the}} project adding more properties. On the other hand <b>risk</b> <b>events</b> take place unexpectedly and it wastes the project money and degrades the value of the project. Therefore in order to absorb this risk cost, without making any burden to the project, conventionally it is practicing to allocate contingency budget. However still the most road and bridge contracts do not meet set cost targets as a result of improper assessment of risk factors inherent in construction. The majority of time and cost overruns are attributable to either unforeseen or foreseen events for which uncertainties were not properly accommodated. The Sri Lankan practice is to add a 10 % contingency sum in bill quantities to cover the risks or uncertainties. However, even with the presence of this contingency allocation, cost overruns still prevail in the industry. Identification of the root causes for the contingency budget overrun and presenting preventive strategies for the small bridge contracts cover the research topic...|$|R

50|$|Traditional {{portfolio}} diversification {{relies on the}} correlations among assets and among asset classes, but these correlations are not constant. Because correlations among assets and asset classes increase during tail <b>risk</b> <b>events</b> and can go to 100%, TRP divides asset classes into buckets that behave differently under market stress conditions, while assets in each bucket behave similarly. During tail <b>risk</b> <b>events</b> asset prices can fall significantly creating deep portfolio drawdowns. Asset classes in each tail risk bucket fall simultaneously during tail <b>risk</b> <b>events</b> and diversification of capital within buckets does not work because periods of negative performance of portfolio components are overlapped. Diversification across tail risk buckets can provide benefits {{in the form of}} smaller portfolio drawdowns and reduce the need for tail risk protection.|$|R

The objective of this research is to develop a model of risk management by integrating several tools. This integration is intended to improve decision making by providing quantitative analysis at each step of risk management. Delphi Method is utilized to identify potential risks, while House of Risk is used to categorize <b>risks</b> into <b>risk</b> <b>events</b> and <b>risk</b> agents and also to rank risk agent. To map relationships between <b>risk</b> <b>events,</b> Interpretive Structural Modeling is used.

This proposed model is applied to assist risk management departement in an Indonesian manufacturing company that has just started to implement Lean Manufacturing {{in the last couple of}} years. Nineteen potential risks have been identified and categorized into ten <b>risk</b> <b>events</b> and nine <b>risk</b> agents. After mapping interrelationships among these risks and calculating adjusted Risk Priority Number, there are top three <b>risk</b> <b>events</b> that should be prioritized to be mitigated, namely: (1) Unable to achieve Key Performance Index target based on SQCDP parameter, (2) Unable to finalize action plan on schedule, (3) Unable to deliver lean manufacturing training material/knowledge to employees.

50|$|Health, safety, and {{environment}} (HSE) are separate practice areas; however, {{they are often}} linked. The {{reason for this is}} typically to do with organizational management structures; however, there are strong links among these disciplines. One of the strongest links between these is that a single <b>risk</b> <b>event</b> may have impacts in all three areas, albeit over differing timescales. For example, the uncontrolled release of radiation or a toxic chemical may have immediate short-term safety consequences, more protracted health impacts, and much longer-term environmental impacts. Events such as Chernobyl, for example, caused immediate deaths, and in the longer term, deaths from cancers, and left a lasting environmental impact leading to birth defects, impacts on wildlife, etc.|$|E
50|$|Conclusion: Mitigating Political Risks in an Uncertain WorldThere {{are four}} main {{strategies}} {{to reduce the}} probability that a <b>risk</b> <b>event</b> will occur: eliminate the threat, minimize its likelihood, isolate the event, or completely avoid the risk. None of these strategies are perfect, so planning to mitigate the impact after a risk occurs is also necessary. A holistic approach to risk management—such as Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)—breaks down categories of risks and standardizes their analysis. However, many corporations fail to incorporate political risks into their risk management frameworks, either because they do not recognize the importance of political risks or they mistakenly think political risks are unpredictable. But political risks are knowable—in some cases, even quantifiable—and understanding these risks {{is the first step in}} successful political risk mitigation.|$|E
30|$|Project {{management}} of product/service orders {{has become a}} mode of operation in many companies. Although these are mostly cyclically recurring projects, risk management {{is very important for}} them. An extended risk-analysis model for new product/service projects is presented in this paper. Emphasis is on a solution developed in the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The usual project activities risk analysis is based on evaluation of the probability that <b>risk</b> <b>events</b> occur and on evaluation of their consequences. A third parameter has been added in our model: an estimate of the incidence of <b>risk</b> <b>events.</b> On the basis of the calculated activity risk level, a project team prepares preventive and corrective measures that should be taken according to the status indicators. An important advantage of the proposed solution is that the project manager and his team members are timely warned of <b>risk</b> <b>events</b> and they can thus activate the envisaged preventive and corrective measures as necessary.|$|R
