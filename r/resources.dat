5|$|Caulfield was {{chairman}} of the committee that drafted the policies, standards and procedures for water <b>resources</b> planning that became known as Senate Document 97, subjecting new federal water projects to benefit/cost analysis for the first time. He was the staff leader in drafting the Water <b>Resources</b> Planning Act of 1965 and was instrumental in its passage through the U.S. Congress; becoming the first Director of the Water <b>Resources</b> Council, a cabinet-level interagency advisory committee created by that Act. From October 1961 to August 1969 he was the leading professional official within the United States government developing and implementing policies for comprehensive river basin planning. In 1968 he drafted and gained political acceptance of a Water <b>Resources</b> Councils' regulation changing the discount rate used in planning water projects from a formula based on the coupon rate of government bonds to one based on the yield rate—a substantial and important policy change. He also had a leading role in early development of the Water <b>Resources</b> Council's Principles and Standards for water project planning promulgated in September 1973.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Runtime <b>resource</b> {{management}} {{is a method}} to enforce a predictable execution to applications with highly and transiently fluctuating <b>resource</b> usage. Having correct runtime predictions regarding <b>resource</b> usage of individual components allows making proper <b>resource</b> reservations, resulting in a better <b>resource</b> management of the component-based applications. In this work, we present a state-based <b>resource</b> usage model for a component, in which states represent CPU utilization intervals. This <b>resource</b> model {{is intended to be}} used in a resource-aware component-based framework, applicable for expressing <b>resource</b> usage estimation of video components. Moreover, we introduce a simple <b>resource</b> prediction strategy that is using this <b>resource</b> model. The quality of this strategy depends on both state size and time slot length, and is given by two quality metrics introduced: the failure rate, which measures the fraction of the time slots in which the reserved budget was insuff icient, and the <b>resource</b> waste, which measures unused budget. 1 Index Terms — runtime <b>resource</b> management, component-based applications, <b>resource</b> model, <b>resource</b> usage, <b>resource</b> prediction I...|$|R
