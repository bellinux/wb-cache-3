40|$|Incomplete {{mixing of}} a {{pharmaceutical}} blend {{could result in}} tablets of non-uniform content. While various blenders {{are used in the}} pharmaceutical industry, this particular project focuses on the performance of ribbon blenders. Ribbon blenders consist of a rotating impeller installed within a U-shaped tank. The overall {{purpose of the study was}} that of evaluating the effect of <b>ribbon</b> <b>blender</b> operational parameters on the product mixture quality. Mix quality or blend uniformity limits are determined by regulatory bodies. These limits served as targets for blending end-points. In a laboratory-scaled ribbon-blender, powder mixtures composed of white and blue microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) were blended. Blend uniformity was evaluated using a statistical approach under various operating conditions such as loading patterns, blender fill heights, impeller rotational speeds and mixing times.

40|$|Blending {{experiments}} and storage trials {{were carried out}} to assess the feasibility of manufacturing infant formula through dry blending of high fat whey powder (HFWP) with whole milk powder (WMP) or a base powder (BP) made from skim milk, sucrose and corn oil. An indication of cohesiveness {{of the components of}} the blends was obtained by measuring compressibility using an Instron testing machine. Compressibility decreased in the following order: BP, wmp, HFWP, lactose and ascorbic acid. Particle size determination using a laser sizer indicated that the particle size increased in the above sequence. Scanning electron microscopy revealed no evidence of an ordered mixture for either whey powder with milk powder or the powders mixed with ascorbic acid. The mixtures did not exhibit complete randomness and segregation. They are thus termed 'pseudorandom mixtures'. HFWP was blended with WMP or BP to achieve a target ratio 50 : 50 in both an experimental <b>ribbon</b> <b>blender</b> and a pilot <b>ribbon</b> <b>blender.</b> Using Response Surface Methodology, load ratio and mixing time but not rotation speed were found to have significant effects on the homogeneity with the experimental <b>ribbon</b> <b>blender.</b> At load ratio 0. 4, the time for reaching a certain homogeneity was shorter than that at load ratio 0. 8. The cohesiveness of BP impaired its mixing. A mixing index based on a satisfactory sample standard deviation has an acceptable value of 1. Both powder ratio scores and ascorbic acid level could be mixed below a MI of 1. 5 but above 1. As to protein, fat, carbohydrate, the mixtures reached the acceptable MI. The secondary nutritional requirements such as the ratio of whey protein to casein and the ratio of unsaturated fatty acid to saturated fatty acid were above 1 when the powder ratio MIs were higher than 1. After mixing WMP and HFWP for 10 minutes differences of sensory quality could not be detected by the taste panelists even though the MI was still above 1. Unblended and blended samples of WMP and HFWP were tested through a 180 day storage trial at 20 °C, 30 °C and 40 °C. There {{was no significant difference between}} unblended and blended samples on the criteria of TBA, PV, HMF, oxidised flavour and caramel flavour at the 5 % probability level. Using the Arrhenius approach, at 20 °C, the shelf lives of unblended and blended samples were estimated as 1628 days and 1090 days respectively, with an oxidised flavour limit of 3. 5 out of 7 points. The shelf lives were 480 days and 466 days based on a PV limit of 2 milliequivalents O 2 per kg fat. Dry blending is a feasible technique for manufacturing infant formula, with acceptable homogeneity of the main components of the blended samples and with normal storage stability. The cohesiveness of the components and the design of blender are important factors in improving homogeneity. Further trials are recommended in both experimental and commercial plants...|$|E

This research examines the critical blending step for continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing and the characteristics of continuous downstream pharmaceutical manufacturing systems.

40|$|Experiments of bulk solid mixing in a twin <b>ribbon</b> blade <b>blender</b> {{have been}} {{performed}} in this work in order to characterize mixing behavior in such a mixer for binary mixtures with different cohesionless materials. The effects of fill height and blade rotation speed on mixing homogeneity have been studied. Mixing homogeneity was determined by sampling. It has been observed that mixing is relatively fast towards a final mixing state within approximately 100 blade rotations for different combinations of material, fill height and blade rotational speed. Moreover, these final mixing states seemed stable within a range of fluctuations, which may prove useful in determining an optimal mixing time for binary, cohesionless particle mixtures and potentially lead {{to a reduction in}} the required number of blade rotations in mixers of this type in industry. Mixing homogeneity results indicated an increased final mixing homogeneity for increasing fill height, most clearly in the range of 30 – 70 vol. % in the studied twin ribbon blade mixer. The torque on one of the shafts was determined. The latter results showed that no significant influence of rotational speed on the required torque for the tested mixtures at rotational velocities in the range of Fr 0. 17 – 1. 1 could be determined for most combinations of the tested materials and fill heights in this work. The quantitative characterization of mixing behavior with the two key parameters mixing homogeneity and torque on the shaft may be used for mixer validation of DEM simulations...|$|R
40|$|Conventional batch {{blending}} of pharmaceutical powders coupled with long quality analysis times increases the production cycle time leading to strained cash flows. Also, scale-up issues faced in process development causes delays in transforming a drug in research to a drug under commercial production. Continuous blending is as an attractive alternative design choice to batch process and is {{examined in this}} work. This work proposes to examine the feasibility of applying continuous blending in pharmaceutical manufacturing. Two kinds of blenders, a double helical <b>ribbon</b> <b>blender</b> and a Zigzag R blender were chosen as experimental systems representing high shear and moderate shear equipment. This work first focuses on developing a process understanding of continuous blending by examining the ow behavior of powders in experimental blenders using impulse stimulus response experiments and subsequent residence time distribution analysis. Powder ow behavior was modeled using an residence time distribution models like axial dispersion models. These ow behavior studies were followed by blender performance studies. The dependence of the mixing performance of the continuous blending system on different operational variables like rotation rates of mixing elements and raw material properties like particle size, shape and cohesion were studied. Mean residence time and time period of fluctuation in the concentration of active ingredient coming at the inlet were {{the two most important}} operational variables that affected blender performance. Larger particles and particles with less cohesion were seen to mix well with higher dispersion coefficients in a <b>ribbon</b> <b>blender.</b> A residence time distribution based process model for continuous blending was investigated and shown to depict the process well within experimental errors in determining the parameters of the residence time distribution model. (cont.) The predictive capability of the process model was found to dependent on the scale of scrutiny of the powder mixture in the blender. Choosing the correct scale of scrutiny was demonstrated to be of critical importance in determination of blend quality. Growing pressures on pharmaceutical industry due to patent expirations has forced manufacturers to look beyond the US and EU for potential manufacturing locations in addition to invest in novel manufacturing methods and technologies. The capstone work in this thesis proposes a framework that managers of pharmaceutical and biologics manufacturing can utilize to identify critical issues in globalization of manufacturing and in making strategic manufacturing location decisions. by Lakshman Pernenkil.

This research examines the critical blending step for continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing and the characteristics of continuous downstream pharmaceutical manufacturing systems. Discrete element method (DEM) simulations were used to develop novel insights into the mechanism of mixing for continuous blending of cohesive pharmaceutical powders and {{to examine the effects}} of particle properties, blender design and operating conditions on blend homogeneity. To place continuous blending into the context of pharmaceutical manufacturing, the scope of the analysis was expanded to process system models of continuous downstream pharmaceutical manufacturing. DEM simulations were used to study the mechanisms of mixing in the continuous blending of pharmaceutical powders. Diffusive mixing from the avalanching particles appears to be the dominant mechanism of mixing in both the axial and radial direction for the double helical <b>ribbon</b> <b>blender.</b> This result can guide the development of future continuous pharmaceutical powder blenders by optimizing the mixing elements to increase the amount of particles transported to a position where they can avalanche/flow and diffusively mix. A range of particle properties, blender designs and operating conditions were examined for their effects on flow behavior and blend homogeneity. Three particle properties were examined: particle size, polydispersity and cohesive force. (cont.) Particle size was observed to be positively correlated to both flow rates and blend homogeneity. Polydispersity had no effect on flow rate and was negatively correlated to homogeneity. Cohesive force was negatively correlated to flow rate and had little to no effect on homogeneity. Two modifications of blender design were analyzed: changes in blender size and changes in shaft design. Blender size was observed to be positively correlated to flow rate and negatively correlated to homogeneity. The paddle shaft designs created a more homogeneous powder blend than the double helical ribbon shaft. Two operating parameters were also studied: rotation rate and fill fraction. Rotation rate was positively correlated to both flow rate and homogeneity. Fill fraction had the interesting result of being positively correlated to the absolute flow rate, but negatively correlated to the fill mass normalized flow rate. In addition, fill fraction has a clear negative correlation to homogeneity above fill fractions of 0. 55, but is inconsistent for fill fractions lower than this. This research on particle properties, blender designs and operating conditions will help to guide the operation of continuous pharmaceutical blenders and the design of continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing systems. Process simulations comparing model batch and continuous downstream pharmaceutical manufacturing systems have quantified some of the potential size, cost and performance benefits of continuous processes. The models showed significant reductions in process equipment sizes for continuous manufacturing particularly in the blending step. (cont.) This reduction in equipment size translates to capital cost (CAPEX) savings for both the continuous process equipment and manufacturing facilities. The steady state operation of continuous processing also reduces the labor requirements and gives the continuous processes an operating cost (OPEX) advantage over batch processes. This research has contributed to the understanding of continuous pharmaceutical powder blending and quantified some of the benefits of continuous downstream pharmaceutical manufacturing. This work is being continued by the Novartis-MIT Center for Continuous Manufacturing whose work is providing the foundation for future industrial scale pharmaceutical continuous manufacturing systems. by Matthew J.
