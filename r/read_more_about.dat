500|$|Some {{critics were}} {{dissatisfied}} with {{the scope of the}} novel. Daniel Mendelsohn of The New York Times Book Review wrote that thematically, there was no reason that a Greek should be an intersex or vice versa and that Eugenides had two disconnected stories to tell. Caly Risen of Flak Magazine believed that the immigrant experience was the [...] "heart of the novel", lamenting that it minimized the story of Callie/Cal who is such a [...] "fascinating character that the reader feels short-changed by his failure to take her/him further." [...] Risen wished to <b>read</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the events between Cal's adolescence and adulthood, such as Cal's experience in college as an intersex person as well as the relationships he had. The Washington Posts Lisa Zeidner opined that Eugenides purposefully devised this asymmetry. Stewart O'Nan of The Atlantic also felt that the brief description of Callie's childhood was lacking; the book [...] "gloss over" [...] how her mother did not recognize that Callie had male genitalia when she was washing or clothing Callie. Further, O'Nan characterized Cal's relationship with the Japanese-American photographer Julie as [...] "underdeveloped", causing the reader not to experience its entirety. Michelle Vellucci of People had the same view about the novel's end, writing that the conclusion felt [...] "rushed".|$|E

2500|$|Tenkara rods are {{a type of}} fly rod {{used for}} tenkara fishing in Japan. A mixture of the rods in the other categories, they are carbon rods, fly rods and {{telescopic}} rods all in one. These are ultra-light and very portable telescopic rods (<b>read</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> telescopic below). Their extended length normally ranges from 11 to 13 feet, {{and they have a}} very soft action. The action of tenkara rods has been standardized as a ratio of [...] "how many parts are stiffer : how many tip parts bend more easily". The standard actions are 5:5, 6:4, 7:3, and 8:2, with 5:5 being a softer/slower rod, and 8:2 being a stiffer rod. Similar to western fly-rods tenkara rods also have cork, and sometimes even wooden handles, with wooden handles (such as red-pine, and phoenix-tree wood) being the more prized rods due to their increased sensitivity to fish bites and the heavier feel that helps balance the rods. Tenkara rods have no guides. Tenkara is a fixed-line fishing method, where no reel is used, but rather the line is tied directly to the tip of the rod. Like the carbon rods mentioned above this allows for [...] "very precise positioning of the fly of which the which in turn enables huge catches of fish with accurate feeding". One of the most common flies used in tenkara fishing is the Sakasa Kebari. Tenkara fishing is very popular in Japan, where these rods can be found in every major tackle shop. In the US, tenkara is beginning to grow in popularity.|$|E

40|$|The latest {{effort to}} improve {{computer}} and network security {{has been for the}} US Congress to pass new laws.
