40|$|The review essay {{discusses}} Wayne Martin’s Theories <b>of</b> <b>Judgment,</b> {{which claims}} that theories <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> confront the difficulty that its object belongs to three distinct sciences: logic, psychology, and phenomenology. The essay denies {{that there is}} such a thing as a phenomenology <b>of</b> <b>judgment,</b> as judgment is not an object of experience, but an act of spontaneity. Moreover, it suggests a more radical reading of Kant than the one proposed by Martin: Kant was right to identify the unity of the content <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> with the force <b>of</b> <b>judgment,</b> which entails that the subject matter of logic, insofar as it treats of relations <b>of</b> contents <b>of</b> <b>judgment,</b> and psychology, insofar as it treats <b>of</b> acts <b>of</b> <b>judgment,</b> is the same...|$|R
