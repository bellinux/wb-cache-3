Levying of good <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> can be done with existence of purchasing system of <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> which in it covers related function, document and note of accountancy applied, procedure network forming system and adequate internal control system. Based on result of the evaluation can be concluded that purchasing system of <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> applied by PT. Djitoe Indonesian Tobacco Coy Surakarta have been good enough and has been supported with adequate internal control system. But still be found some weakness like existence of geminating function of receiving with function of warehouse and has not existence of <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> purchasing system flowchart.

This resulted in costs because inefficient production processes are inhibited or had to perform an emergency procurement of <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> to meet customer orders. The company seeks to use the method in determining the order quantity of <b>raw</b> <b>material,</b> comprising the steps of (1) collecting historical data of <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> use, step (2) forecasting needs <b>raw</b> <b>materials,</b> step (3) calculating the order quantity forecasting based on the data by comparing the deterministic method and probabilistic methods. Calculating safety stock for each <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> is done so as to cope with the situation outside of normal conditions, such a surge in orders. In its design, the system will be developed using the Unified Modeling Language modeling language (UML) {{on the basis of the}} concept of object-oriented analysis and design (Object Oriented Analysis and Design). With the proposed implementation of the information system, the company can estimate the need for <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> more quickly and accurately, and can determine the order quantity that is tailored to the needs.
