5|$|Spiders often attach {{highly visible}} silk bands, called decorations or stabilimenta, to their webs.

5|$|The ruff is a wader in {{the large}} family Scolopacidae, the typical shorebirds. Recent <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> its closest {{relatives}} are the broad-billed sandpiper, Calidris falcinellus, and the sharp-tailed sandpiper, Calidris acuminata. It has no recognised subspecies or geographical variants.|$|E
5|$|A {{pandemic}} is {{a worldwide}} epidemic. The 1918 flu pandemic, which lasted until 1919, was a category 5 influenza pandemic {{caused by an}} unusually severe and deadly influenza A virus. The victims were often healthy young adults, in contrast to most influenza outbreaks, which predominantly affect juvenile, elderly, or otherwise-weakened patients. Older estimates say it killed 40–50million people, while more recent <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> it may have killed as many as 100million people, or 5% of the world's population in 1918.|$|E
5|$|Current <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> {{the primary}} method of {{infection}} in animals is through ingestion. It {{is thought that}} prions may be deposited in the environment through the remains of dead animals and via urine, saliva, and other body fluids. They may then linger in the soil by binding to clay and other minerals.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{researchers}} in the field focus on development of cognitive flexibility {{between the ages of}} three and five. However, cognitive flexibility {{has been shown to be}} a broad concept that can be studied with all different ages and situations. Thus, with tasks ranging from simple to more complex, <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> there is a developmental continuum that spans from infancy to adulthood.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> {{cranberry}} (juice or capsules) may {{decrease the}} number of UTIs in those with frequent infections. A Cochrane review concluded that the benefit, if it exists, is small. Long-term tolerance is also an issue with gastrointestinal upset occurring in more than 30%. Cranberry juice is thus not currently recommended for this indication. As of 2015, probiotics require further study {{to determine if they}} are beneficial.|$|E
5|$|The foregut of the tammar wallaby {{contains}} {{species of}} bacteria {{belonging to the}} phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. Within the phylum Proteobacteria, species of the family Succinivibrionaceae are the most abundant and a new species named WG–1 was discovered. WG–1 is a capnophilic bacterium. This has important environmental implications as the bacteria produces less methane than others and does not require CO2 to survive. <b>Research</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> this information {{could be used to}} reduce carbon production in livestock.|$|E

5|$|The new <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> {{the rocky}} centres of super-Earths are {{unlikely}} to evolve into terrestrial rocky planets like the inner planets of our Solar System because they appear {{to hold on to}} their large atmospheres. Rather than evolving to a planet composed mainly of rock with a thin atmosphere, the small rocky core remains engulfed by its large hydrogen-rich envelope.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} North Korean forces {{committed}} to the region is not known, however later <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the North Korean 6th Division committed at least a battalion to the fight, {{and it is likely}} that an entire regiment was ordered to advance on the Notch and Masan. This would put the range of North Korean forces involved in the battle between 500 and 2,000.|$|E
5|$|Gediminas' origins are unclear, {{but recent}} <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> Skalmantas, an {{otherwise}} unknown historical figure, was Gediminas' grandfather or father {{and could be}} considered the dynasty's founder. Because none of his brothers or sisters had known heirs, Gediminas, who sired at least twelve children, had the advantage in establishing sovereignty over his siblings. Known for his diplomatic skills, Gediminas arranged his children's marriages to suit the goals of his foreign policy: his sons consolidated Lithuanian power within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, while his daughters established or strengthened alliances with the rulers of areas in modern-day Russia, Ukraine and Poland.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Oram began a second book, which survives in {{manuscript}}, titled The Sound of the Past - A Resonating Speculation. In this manuscript she speculates on archeological acoustics and presents a theory backed by <b>research</b> <b>that</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> Neolithic chambered mounds and ancient sites like Stonehenge and The Great Pyramid in Egypt {{were used as}} resonators. She said <b>that</b> her <b>research</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the ancients may have possessed acute knowledge about properties of sound in long distance communication.|$|R

5|$|However, later <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> {{the initial}} {{stability}} of the implant in bone is a more important determinant of success of implant integration, rather than {{a certain period of}} healing time. As a result, the time allowed to heal is typically based on the density of bone the implant is placed in and the number of implants splinted together, rather than a uniform amount of time. When implants can withstand high torque (35 Ncm) and are splinted to other implants, there are no meaningful differences in long-term implant survival or bone loss between implants loaded immediately, at three months, or at six months. The corollary is that single implants, even in solid bone, require a period of no-load to minimize the risk of initial failure.|$|E
5|$|More recent <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> that {{fortification}} actually {{commanded the}} harbour adequately. No single site {{would have been}} completely effective due to the rugged coastline, and that Harry's Walls may {{have been designed to}} work in concert with another fort. Furthermore, the fort would have fitted easily into its proposed location and have been easy to defend, due to the surrounding water and marshland. Instead, the high costs of England's wider fortification programme - Edward's government spent an unsustainable £35,228 on construction work during the five years of his reign - are blamed for making its completion unviable, particularly once the French invasion threat had passed.|$|E
5|$|Scotland's {{populations of}} Alpine Woodsia and Oblong Woodsia {{are on the}} edge of their natural ranges. The UK {{distribution}} of the former is confined to Angus, Perthshire, Argyll and north Wales, and of the latter to Angus, the Moffat Hills, north Wales and two locations in England. The plants were first identified as separate species by John Bolton in 1785 and came under severe threat from Victorian fern collectors in the mid 19th century. Cystopteris dickieana, first discovered in a sea cave in Kincardineshire, is a rare fern in a UK context whose distribution is confined to Scotland, although recent <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> it may be a variant of C. fragilis rather than a species in its own right.|$|E
50|$|While the {{evidence}} supporting late selection hypotheses is significant {{and has been}} consistently reproduced, there also exists a body of <b>research</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> unattended stimuli in fact may not receive significant processing.|$|R

5|$|Some <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> G-spot and {{clitoral}} orgasms are of {{the same}} origin. Masters and Johnson {{were the first to}} determine that the clitoral structures surround and extend along and within the labia. Upon studying women's sexual response cycle to different stimulation, they observed that both clitoral and vaginal orgasms had the same stages of physical response, and found that the majority of their subjects could only achieve clitoral orgasms, while a minority achieved vaginal orgasms. On this basis, Masters and Johnson argued that clitoral stimulation is the source of both kinds of orgasms, reasoning that the clitoris is stimulated during penetration by friction against its hood.|$|E
5|$|The Gaelic Revival of {{the early}} twentieth century has had a {{long-term}} influence. There is now an extensive network of urban Irish speakers (Gaeilgeoirí) in both the Republic and Northern Ireland, especially in Dublin and Belfast. They represent an expanding demographic, with their own schools (called Gaelscoileanna) and their own social media. It has been argued that they tend to be more highly educated than monolingual English speakers, with better employment prospects and higher social status. Recent <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> urban Irish is developing in a direction of its own, both in pronunciation and grammar. Irish is also taught in mainstream English-speaking schools as a compulsory subject, but has been criticised for its ineffectiveness.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} explanations for the high mortality rate of the 1918 influenza pandemic. Some <b>research</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the specific {{variant of the virus}} had an unusually aggressive nature. One group of researchers recovered the original virus from the bodies of frozen victims, and found that transfection in animals caused a rapid progressive respiratory failure and death through a cytokine storm (overreaction of the body's immune system). It was then postulated that the strong immune reactions of young adults ravaged the body, whereas the weaker immune systems of children and middle-aged adults resulted in fewer deaths among those groups.|$|E
40|$|Associations are {{a widely}} used {{construct}} of object-oriented languages. However, {{the meaning of}} associations for conceptual modelling of application domains remains unclear. Ontological considerations in past <b>research</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> associations {{are related to the}} concept of mutual properties. Specifically, previous <b>research</b> has <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> mutual properties, not associations, should be modelled, and guidelines for doing this in UML have been offered. This paper presents the results of an experimental study, which <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> this guidance does in fact lead to improved models...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{practices and}} attitudes of special educators from various states around the country regarding what {{they consider to be}} the most important elements for effective co-teaching.
