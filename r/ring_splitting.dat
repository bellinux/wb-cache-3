50|$|The septin cortex {{undergoes}} several changes {{throughout the}} cell cycle: The first visible septin structure {{is a distinct}} ring which appears ~15 min before bud emergence. After bud emergence, the ring broadens to assume {{the shape of an}} hourglass around the mother-bud neck. During cytokinesis, the septin cortex splits into a double ring which eventually disappears. How can the septin cortex undergo such dramatic changes, although some of its functions may require it to be a stable structure? FRAP analysis has revealed that the turnover of septins at the neck undergoes multiple changes during the cell cycle. The predominant, functional conformation is characterized by a low turnover rate (frozen state), during which the septins are phosphorylated. Structural changes require a destabilization of the septin cortex (fluid state) induced by dephosphorylation prior to bud emergence, <b>ring</b> <b>splitting</b> and cell separation.|$|E

40|$|One {{important}} {{application of}} fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites is as a confining material for concrete in the retrofit of existing concrete columns by {{the provision of}} FRP jackets. Such jackets are commonly formed in a wet layup process, with the fibers being only or predominantly in the hoop direction. It has been well established in recent studies that the rupture strains/strengths of FRP measured in tests on such FRP-confined concrete cylinders fall substantially below those from flat coupon tensile tests, but the causes are unclear. This paper {{presents the results of}} a study that is aimed at clarifying these causes. To this end, the paper reports and compares the ultimate tensile strains of two types of FRP (carbon FRP and glass FRP) obtained from three types of tests-flat coupon tensile tests, <b>ring</b> <b>splitting</b> tests, and FRP-confined concrete cylinder tests. Based on comparisons of these test results, it can be concluded that the FRP hoop rupture strains in FRP-confined concrete cylinders are reduced below the ultimate tensile strains from flat coupon tests by at least three factors - (1) the curvature of the FRP jacket; (2) the deformation localization of the cracked concrete; and (3) the existence of an overlapping zone. While the first factor that reduces the in situ strain capacity of FRP on confined concrete is material dependent, the last two factors that result in a nonuniform strain distribution in the jacket are independent of the FRP material properties. The third effect reduces the average hoop rupture but does not affect the distribution of the confining pressure, as the FRP jacket is thicker in the overlapping zone.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} catalog of 700 confirmed star clusters {{in the field}} of M 31 compiled from three major existing catalogs. We detect 418 and 257 star clusters in Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) near-ultraviolet (NUV) and far-ultraviolet (FUV) imaging, respectively. Our final catalog includes photometry of star clusters in up to 16 passbands ranging from FUV to NIR as well as ancillary information such as reddening, metallicity, and radial velocities. In particular, this is the most extensive and updated catalog of UV integrated photometry for M 31 star clusters. Ages and masses of star clusters are derived by fitting the multi-band photometry with model spectral energy distribution (SED); UV photometry enables more accurate age estimation of young clusters. Our catalog includes 182 young clusters with ages less than 1 Gyr. Our estimated ages and masses of young clusters are in good agreement with previously determined values in the literature. The mean age and mass of young clusters are about 300 Myr and 10 ^ 4 M_sun, respectively. We found that the compiled [Fe/H] values of young clusters included in our catalog are systematically lower (by more than 1 dex) than those from recent high-quality spectroscopic data and our SED fitting result. We confirm that most of the young clusters kinematics show systematic rotation around the minor axis and association with the thin disk of M 31. The young clusters distribution exhibits a distinct peak in the M 31 disk around 10 - 12 kpc from the center and follow a spatial distributions similar to other tracers of disk structure such as OB stars, UV star-forming regions, and dust. Some young clusters also show concentration around the <b>ring</b> <b>splitting</b> regions found {{in the southern part of}} the M 31 disk and most of them have systematically younger (< 100 Myr) ages.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{photometry}} for young star clusters in M 31, which are selected from Caldwell et al. These star clusters {{have been observed}} {{as part of the}} Beijing [...] Arizona [...] Taiwan [...] Connecticut (BATC) Multicolor Sky Survey from 1995 February to 2008 March. The BATC images including these star clusters are taken with 15 intermediate-band filters covering 3000 [...] 10000 Å. Combined with photometry in the GALEX far- and near-ultraviolet, broad-band UBVRI, SDSS ugriz, and infrared JHK_ s of Two Micron All Sky Survey, we obtain their accurate spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from 1538 - 20000 Å. We derive these star clusters' ages and masses by comparing their SEDs with stellar population synthesis models. Our results are in good agreement with previous determinations. The mean value of age and mass of young clusters (< 2 Gyr) is about 385 Myr and 2 × 10 ^ 4 M_, respectively. There are two distinct peaks in the age distribution, a highest peak at age ∼ 60 Myr and a secondary peak around 250 Myr, while the mass distribution shows a single peak around 10 ^ 4 M_. A few young star clusters have two-body relaxation times greater than their ages, indicating that those clusters have not been well dynamically relaxed and therefore have not established the thermal equilibrium. There are several regions showing aggregations of young star clusters around the 10 kpc ring and the outer ring, indicating that the distribution of the young star clusters is well correlated with M 31 's star-forming regions. The young massive star clusters (age ≤ 100 Myr and mass ≥ 10 ^ 4 M_) show apparent concentration around the <b>ring</b> <b>splitting</b> region, suggesting a recent passage of a satellite galaxy (M 32) through M 31 disk.

40|$|Septins are conserved filament-forming {{proteins}} that act in diverse cellular processes. They closely associate with membranes and, in some systems, {{components of the}} cytoskeleton. It is not well understood how filaments assemble into higher-order structures in vivo or how they are remodeled throughout the cell cycle. In the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, septins are found {{through most of the}} cell cycle in an hourglass organization at the mother-bud neck until cytokinesis when the collar splits into two rings that disassemble prior to the next cell cycle. Experiments using polarized fluorescence microscopy have suggested that septins are arranged in ordered, paired filaments in the hourglass and undergo a coordinated 90 ° reorientation during splitting at cytokinesis. This apparent reorganization could be due to two orthogonal populations of filaments disassembling and reassembling or being preferentially retained at cytokinesis. In support of this idea, we report a decrease in septin concentration at the mother-bud neck during cytokinesis consistent with other reports and the timing of the decrease depends on known septin regulators including the Gin 4 kinase. We took a candidate-based approach to examine what factors control reorientation during splitting and used polarized fluorescence microscopy to screen mutant yeast strains deficient in septin interacting proteins. Using this method, we have linked known septin regulators to different aspects of the assembly, stability, and reorganization of septin assemblies. The data support that <b>ring</b> <b>splitting</b> requires Gin 4 activity and an anillin-like protein Bud 4, and normal accumulation of septins at the ring requires phosphorylation of Shs 1.
