5|$|Malaysia {{established}} the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) {{to investigate the}} incident, working with foreign aviation authorities and experts. Malaysia has stated that a final report on Flight 370 will be released {{by the end of}} 2017. Neither the crew nor the aircraft's communication systems relayed a distress signal, indications of bad weather, or technical problems before the aircraft vanished. Two passengers travelling on stolen passports were investigated, but eliminated as suspects. Malaysian police have identified the captain as the prime suspect if human intervention was the cause of the disappearance, after clearing all others on the flight of suspicious motives. Power was lost to the aircraft's satellite data unit (SDU) at some point between 01:07 and 02:03; the SDU logged onto Inmarsat's satellite communication network at 02:25—three minutes after the aircraft left the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>radar.</b> Based on analysis of the satellite communications, the aircraft turned south after passing north of Sumatra and the flight continued for six hours with little deviation in its track, ending when its fuel was exhausted.|$|E
5|$|During flight, the {{aircraft}} maintains a datalink with a satellite communication network for data and telephone calls. The datalink connects {{the aircraft}} and a ground station via satellite, which translates (changes) the signal's frequency and amplifies the signal; the ground station {{is connected to}} telecommunication networks which allows messages {{to be sent to}} and received from other locations, such as the airline's operations centre. Normal communications from Flight370 were last made at 1:07MYT and the datalink between the aircraft and satellite telecommunication network was lost at some point between 1:07 and 2:03, when the aircraft did not acknowledge a message sent from the ground station. Three minutes after the aircraft left the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>radar</b> coverage—at 2:25—the aircraft's satellite data unit (SDU) transmitted a log-on message, which investigators believe occurred as the SDU started after a power interruption. Between the 2:25 message and 8:19, the SDU acknowledged two ground-to-aircraft telephone calls, which were not answered, and responded to automated, hourly requests from the ground station that were made to determine whether the SDU was still active. None of the communications from 2:25–8:19 contain explicit information about the aircraft's location. The aircraft's final transmission at 8:19 was a log-on message; the aircraft did not respond to a message from the ground station at 9:15. Investigators believe the 8:19 log-on message was made when the SDU was restarting after the aircraft ran out of fuel and the aircraft's auxiliary power unit was started.|$|E

5000|$|According to Budiansky, [...] "In late March 1951, the 1st RSM (1st Radio Squadron, Mobile), still {{operating}} in Japan, picked up Russian ground controllers in voice communication with Soviet MiG fighter aircraft operating over North Korea. This became an [...] "intelligence windfall", because [...] "Soviet doctrine called for tight control of fighters by stations {{on the ground}} tracking the location of friendly and enemy aircraft on radar throughout the battle." [...] These radio intercepts gave additional warning beyond the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>radar.</b> This breakthrough in signals intelligence, centralized at a single USAFSS facility in Seoul, meant real-time listening of Russian controllers and fighters and the subsequent passing of information to U.S. pilots. [...] "An analysis of ground control traffic in June 1952 concluded that more than 90 percent of MiGs engaged in air operations over North Korea were being flown by Russians." ...|$|E
5000|$|The super high {{frequency}} radio waves used by most radars, called microwaves, travel in straight lines. This generally limits the detection <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>radar</b> systems to objects on their horizon (generally referred to as [...] "line of sight" [...] since the aircraft {{must be at least}} theoretically visible to a person at the location and elevation of the radar transmitter) due to the curvature of the Earth. For example, a radar mounted on top of a 10 m mast has a range to the horizon of about 13 km, taking into account atmospheric refraction effects. If the target is above the surface, this range will be increased accordingly, so a target 10 m high can be detected by the same radar at 26 km. Siting the antenna on a high mountain can increase the range somewhat; but, in general, it is impractical to build radar systems with line-of-sight ranges beyond a few hundred kilometres.|$|E
50|$|Metox {{provided}} the U-boat commander with an advantage {{that had not}} been anticipated by the British. The Metox set beeped at the pulse rate of the hunting aircraft's radar, approximately once per second. When the radar operator came within 9 miles of the U-boat, he changed the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> his <b>radar.</b> With the change <b>of</b> <b>range,</b> the <b>radar</b> doubled its pulse repetition frequency and as a result, the Metox beeping frequency also doubled, warning the commander that he had been detected.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} summer of 1991, the {{then head of}} Equipment Department of PLAN, rear admiral He Pengfei (贺鹏飞, son of late Field Marshal He Long) met with the team of 14th Institute at 3rd Directorate of the People's Liberation Army General Staff Department in Beijing. Admiral He {{informed}} the team that the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> Chinese <b>radars</b> onboard PLAN ship was only several dozen kilometers while <b>radar</b> <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> <b>radars</b> onboard Japanese and Taiwanese warships was two hundred to three hundred kilometers. In the event of war, PLAN ships would be sunk before they could detect enemy ships, {{so it would be}} imperative for Chinese radar developers to develop a phased array radar to boost the combat capability of PLAN. [...] To meet this requirement of PLAN that would eventually become PLAN’s SAPARS (Shipborne Active Phased Array Radar System) project/program, the 14th institute presented the development and research results since November 1989, and Mr. Zhang Guang-Yi informed PLAN that based on the size limitation <b>of</b> the <b>radar</b> antenna (4 meter x 4 meter) onboard Type 052B destroyer, a S-band APAR would have a <b>range</b> in excess <b>of</b> 300 km, 50% higher than the original PLAN requirement of 200 km.|$|R

50|$|Land-based {{systems were}} used {{because there were}} severe {{technical}} problems operating on ships, mainly due {{to the effects of}} the superstructure on the wavefront of arriving radio signals. However, these problems were overcome under the technical leadership of the Polish engineer Wacław Struszyński, working at the Admiralty Signal Establishment. As ships were equipped, a complex measurement series was carried out to determine these effects, and cards were supplied to the operators to show the required corrections at various frequencies. By 1942, the availability of cathode ray tubes improved and was no longer a limit on the number of huff-duff sets that could be produced. At the same time, improved sets were introduced that included continuously motor-driven tuning, to scan the likely frequencies and sound an automatic alarm when any transmissions were detected. Operators could then rapidly fine-tune the signal before it disappeared. These sets were installed on convoy escorts, enabling them to get fixes on U-boats transmitting from over the horizon, beyond the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>radar.</b> This allowed hunter-killer ships and aircraft to be dispatched at high speed {{in the direction of the}} U-boat, which could be located by radar if still on the surface or ASDIC if submerged.|$|E

30|$|High-{{resolution}} radar {{can achieve}} a high range resolution by transmitting a wideband signal and using modern pulse compression techniques [1].

With the extensive applications <b>of</b> high-resolution <b>radars,</b> the problem <b>of</b> detecting <b>range</b> distributed targets arises naturally and has received considerable attention [5 – 7]. Nevertheless, it is known that for high-resolution radars, sea clutter character becomes very complex and sea clutter is often highly non-Gaussian, even spiky [8].
