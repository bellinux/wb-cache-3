50|$|The Data Collection Form (Form SF-SAC) is a {{worksheet}} which recipients must complete {{online and}} include with the Single Audit reporting packages {{sent to the}} FAC.

The Data Collection Form is created online and a physical copy is sent with the Single Audit <b>reporting</b> <b>package</b> to the FAC, certified by both the recipient and the auditor. Beginning with the submission of 2008 audit submissions, the entire audit package must be submitted electronically.|$|E

Then, it may receive N request packets from N UEs respectively and then send the corresponding response packets back, where its communication complexity is O(N). Moreover, it must broadcast starting package for receiving mode selection (see line 4 in Algorithm  4) and then receive N receiving mode selection information <b>reporting</b> <b>packages</b> from N receiving UEs (see lines 6 ~ 10 in Algorithm  4), where its communication complexity is O(N).|$|R
30|$|<b>Report</b> <b>package</b> is {{a program}} {{collection}} which is responsible for the output of system information and performance evaluation metrics, whose main capability {{is to make the}} system information output module independent of other packages. The output format of information can be arbitrarily changed under the premise of not affecting the other packages. The design idea of this package comes from the concept of the observation point in queueing theory, and a chain of responsibility patterns is used to design system architecture. The modular functions have two parts, namely system monitor and performance evaluation metrics. The former one includes system scenario and simulation parameters, as well as the important information at the time of system status changed. The latter one includes throughput, packet delay time, packet queue length, packet waiting time, and packet drop ratio. The UML diagram for <b>report</b> <b>package</b> is shown in Appendix  1 : Fig. 15.|$|R
50|$|When {{completed}} {{reports are}} usually passed to those commissioning the investigation, such as law enforcement (for criminal cases) or the employing company (in civil cases), who will then {{decide whether to}} use the evidence in court.

50|$|When the Single Audit is complete, the {{recipient}} must send the auditor's reports and other required documentation to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC). The FAC then enters {{the results of}} the audit into its electronic database and stores the data. The information included in the database is limited to {{the recipient}}’s basic information (including contact information, addresses, etc.), the auditor’s basic information, the types of federal assistance received and audited (also known as federal programs), and the type of auditor's findings, if any, detected in the Single Audit (e.g., situations of noncompliance, illegal acts, etc.). The online database can be accessed by federal agencies and the general public to learn about a specific recipient’s Single Audit results, although it is limited to the information previously mentioned. Additionally, federal agencies may request to see a recipient’s Single Audit <b>reporting</b> <b>package</b> to obtain more specific and detailed information about the audit results and about any findings encountered.|$|E
50|$|Typically a PACS {{consists}} of a multitude of devices. The first step in typical PACS systems is the modality. Modalities are typically computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, nuclear medicine, positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Depending on the facility's workflow most modalities send to a quality assurance (QA) workstation or sometimes called a PACS gateway. The QA workstation is a checkpoint to make sure patient demographics are correct {{as well as other}} important attributes of a study. If the study information is correct the images are passed to the archive for storage. The central storage device (archive) stores images and in some cases reports, measurements and other information that resides with the images. The next step in the PACS workflow is the reading workstations. The reading workstation is where the radiologist reviews the patient's study and formulates their diagnosis. Normally tied to the reading workstation is a <b>reporting</b> <b>package</b> that assists the radiologist with dictating the final report. Reporting software is optional and there are various ways in which doctors prefer to dictate their report. Ancillary to the workflow mentioned, there is normally CD/DVD authoring software used to burn patient studies for distribution to patients or referring physicians. The diagram above shows a typical workflow in most imaging centers and hospitals. Note that this section does not cover integration to a Radiology Information System, Hospital Information System and other such front-end system that relates to the PACS workflow.|$|E

30|$|We find {{evidence}} that an increased level of voluntary strategy disclosure {{in the management}} report is indeed on average associated with lower cost of equity capital, lower bid–ask spreads and higher trading volumes.

30|$|Incremental {{effect of}} SDS: From our perspective, {{a major issue}} is that of {{assessing}} the incremental effect of SDS {{on the cost of}} equity capital, bid–ask spreads and trading volume.

30|$|It is {{therefore}} debatable whether voluntary strategy disclosures {{really have a}} beneficial impact {{on the cost of}} equity capital.
