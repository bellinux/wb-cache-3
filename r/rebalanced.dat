40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Risk Management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. Portfolio {{managers}} {{typically have}} two choices: let the portfolio drift with the markets or give direction to the portfolio by <b>rebalancing</b> {{according to a}} target allocation. Simply allowing the portfolio to drift with the markets without <b>rebalancing</b> is no longer appropriate. This leaves portfolio managers with the second option of giving direction to the portfolio according to a target allocation. 'This {{can be achieved by}} implementing an existing <b>rebalancing</b> strategy. Portfolio managers typically rely on ad hoc <b>rebalancing</b> strategies that are either calendar-based, such as monthly or quarterly <b>rebalancing,</b> or volatility-based, such as <b>rebalancing</b> whenever the asset ratios are more than 5 % from the target. In the volatility-based <b>rebalancing</b> strategies, the percentage from the target indicates when <b>rebalancing</b> should occur, and the percentage relies on rule of thumb or the use of historical data. The problem with using historical data is that it will not necessarily predict appropriate ranges for the future. These ranges give the indication of when <b>rebalancing</b> should occur. This indicates a need to develop a well-defined <b>rebalancing</b> strategy that assists the portfolio manager to manage a portfolio. Such a <b>rebalancing</b> strategy should be easy to implement. The aim of this research was to develop and implement a well-defined <b>rebalancing</b> strategy that is adjustable over time to assist portfolio managers to maintain their portfolios in line with the objectives and risk aversions of the trustees' of a pension fund. The study introduced the concept of a portfolio drift strategy to set the scene for the different <b>rebalancing</b> strategies. This was to emphasise the importance for a portfolio manager to adopt a <b>rebalancing</b> strategy for a pension fund. An overview is provided of the five broad <b>rebalancing</b> strategies followed by some advantages and disadvantages of each. Certain <b>rebalancing</b> strategies were used to explain the benefit of <b>rebalancing</b> and the cost of <b>rebalancing.</b> The study investigated different methodologies used to identify when the portfolio manager should <b>rebalance</b> and how far back the portfolio manager should <b>rebalance.</b> The study focused on Masters' range <b>rebalancing</b> strategy and this strategy was used as the benchmark strategy for the study. The study summarises the benchmark strategy that will be used to evaluate the alternative <b>rebalancing</b> strategies. A selective number of performance measurement tools were used to evaluate the benchmark strategy. This criterion was used to compare the alternative <b>rebalancing</b> strategies. The study introduced a new decision-making method that has the same return as the benchmark strategy but the risk of the portfolio is lower. The decision-making method is called the second difference method (SD-method). The SD-method builds on Masters' range <b>rebalancing</b> strategy by eliminating certain implicit assumptions made by Masters. The elimination of Masters' implicit assumptions led to an increase in the complexity of the SD-method of the procedure to <b>rebalance.</b> The complexity was eliminated using a computer program formulating the rules of the SD-method. The study developed a new method called the Cusum Test method (CT-method) with its own assumptions and risk specifications to identify when <b>rebalancing</b> should occur. The new method discussed in the study was less complex to implement and, in contrast to Masters' range <b>rebalancing,</b> the ranges were adjustable over time. The CT-method outperformed Masters' range <b>rebalancing</b> strategy and the SD-method on a risk-adjusted return basis. Doctora...|$|R
40|$|Portfolio <b>rebalancing</b> {{strategy}} {{is of great}} importance {{to minimize the risk}} taken so as to ensure profitable investments. Regular <b>rebalancing</b> keeps the portfolio developing as it was planned and achieved initial invest goals.

After elaborating the four traditional <b>rebalancing</b> strategies and a set of risk measurements, the thesis proposed the multiplier <b>rebalancing</b> strategy, which combines the traditional periodically <b>rebalancing</b> strategy with the interval <b>rebalancing</b> strategy, and Relative Strength Index (RSI) <b>rebalancing</b> strategy based on technical analysis. In order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the multiplier and RSI <b>rebalancing</b> strategies, the thesis conducts an experiment to compare the performances of two proposed strategies with the other four traditional strategies in terms of the rewards and risk measurements by using nineteen years Canadian stock and bond Indices and Exchange Traded Funds data from 1983 to 2010.

40|$|In {{a dynamic}} {{investment}} situation, the right timing of portfolio revisions and adjustments {{is essential to}} sustain long-term growth. A high <b>rebalancing</b> frequency reduces the portfolio performance {{in the presence of}} transaction costs, whereas a low <b>rebalancing</b> frequency entails a static investment strategy that hardly reacts to changing market conditions. This article studies a family of portfolio problems in a Black-Scholes type economy which depend parametrically on the <b>rebalancing</b> frequency. As an objective criterion we use log-utility, which has strong theoretical appeal and represents a natural choice if the primary goal is long-term performance. We argue that continuous <b>rebalancing</b> only slightly outperforms discrete <b>rebalancing</b> if there are no transaction costs and if the <b>rebalancing</b> intervals are shorter than about one year. Our analysis also reveals that diversification has a dual effect on the mean and variance of the portfolio growth rate as well as on their sensitivities with respect to the <b>rebalancing</b> frequency.

40|$|Relaxed {{balancing}} {{of search}} trees was introduced {{with the aim}} of speeding up the updates and allowing a high degree of concurrency.

In this paper we revisit the <b>rebalancing</b> of chromatic trees, a relaxed version of red-black trees.
