40|$|The small subunit of {{ribonucleotide}} reductase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (RNR 2) was induced 3 - to 20 -fold by {{a variety}} of DNA-damaging agents. Induction of the RNR 2 transcript by {{at least one of these}} agents, methyl methanesulfonate, did not require protein synthesis. To identify sequences involved in the regulation of RNR 2, we introduced deletions upstream of the transcription start site. Sequences required for induction were contained within a 200 -base-pair region that could confer methyl methanesulfonate inducibility on the heterologous CYC 1 promoter. This region contained a <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> and at least two positive activation sites. One of these activation sites bound RAP 1, a protein known to associate with mating-type silencers and the upstream activation sequences of a number of genes. The behavior of deletions of the <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> suggests that induction of RNR 2 may occur, at least in part, through relief of repression...|$|E
40|$|The PHR 1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes the DNA {{repair enzyme}} photolyase. Transcription of PHR 1 {{increases}} {{in response to}} treatment of cells with 254 -nm radiation and chemical agents that damage DNA. We report here the identification of a damage-responsive DNA binding protein, termed photolyase regulatory protein (PRP), and its cognate binding site, termed the PHR 1 upstream <b>repression</b> <b>sequence,</b> that together regulate induction of PHR 1 transcription after DNA damage. PRP activity, monitored by electrophoretic-mobility-shift assay, was detected in cells during normal growth but disappeared within 30 min after irradiation. Copper-phenanthroline footprinting of PRP-DNA complexes revealed that PRP protects a 39 -base-pair region of PHR 1 5 ' flanking sequence beginning 40 base pairs upstream from the coding sequence. A prominent feature of the foot-printed region is a 22 -base-pair palindrome. Deletion of the PHR 1 upstream <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> increased the basal level expression of PHR 1 in vivo and decreased induction after exposure of cells to UV radiation or methyl methanesulfonate, whereas insertion of the PRP binding site between the CYC 1 upstream activation sequence and "TATA" sequence reduced basal level expression and conferred damage responsiveness upon a reporter gene. Thus these observations establish that PRP is a damage-responsive repressor of PHR 1 transcription...|$|E
40|$|The SIN 3 global {{regulatory}} factor affects expression of many yeast genes, including the phospholipid biosynthetic gene, INO 1. Mutations in the SIN 3 gene result in {{elevated levels of}} INO 1 expression under conditions that normally confer full repression of INO 1 transcription, indicating that SIN 3 is a negative regulator of INO 1. In this study, the INO 1 promoter was analyzed for sequences that {{play a role in}} responding to SIN 3 -mediated repression. Two distinct promoter elements, the upstream <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> (URS 1) and the INO 1 upstream activation sequence (UASINO) both were found to be involved in enabling SIN 3 to repress INO 1 expression...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{identified}} a bifunctional regulatory element located between nt 374 and 431 upstream of TATA box of porcine adenovirus (PAV) 3 E 1 A promoter. Deletion of the element dramatically reduced the steady-state level of E 1 A mRNA, but increased that of E 1 B, which lies immediately downstream of E 1 A. The mutant virus displayed defective replication at early times of infection, but replicated nearly {{as efficiently as}} wild-type PAV- 3 at late times of infection. This defect was complemented with coinfecting wild-type virus in a mixed infection.

40|$|The PHR 1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes the {{apoenzyme}} for the DNA {{repair enzyme}} photolyase. PHR 1 transcription is induced {{in response to}} 254 nm radiation {{and a variety of}} chemical damaging agents. We report here the identification of promoter elements required for PHR 1 expression. Transcription is regulated primarily through three sequence elements clustered within a 120 bp region immediately upstream of the translational start site. A 20 bp interrupted palindrome comprises UASPHR 1 and is responsible for 80 - 90 % of basal and induced expression. UASPHR 1 alone can activate transcription of a CYC 1 minimal promoter but does not confer damage responsiveness. In the intact PHR 1 promoter UAS function is dependent upon an upstream essential sequence (UES). URSPHR 1 contains a binding site for the damage-responsive repressor Prp; consistent with this role, deletion or specific mutations of the URS increase basal level expression and decrease the induction ratio. Deletion of URSPHR 1 also eliminates the requirement for UESPHR 1 for promoter activation, indicating that the UES attenuates Prp-mediated <b>repression.</b> <b>Sequences</b> within UASPHR 1 are similar to regulatory sequences found upstream of both damage responsive and nonresponsive genes involved in DNA repair and metabolism...|$|R

Oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis of this sequence identified bases required for catabolite repression. Two mutations increased both the 2 -fold symmetry of the operator and the repression ratio. Although many mutations reduced the repression ratio 3 - to 11 -fold, some also caused a 2 -fold or greater increase in amylase production. Others caused hyperproduction without affecting catabolite <b>repression.</b> Homologous <b>sequences</b> in other catabolite-repressed B. subtilis promoters suggest a common regulatory site {{may be involved in}} catabolite repression...|$|R

We have mapped a short repression motif to residues 150 â€“ 170 within the N-terminal domain of CTCF. This motif is active in HeLa, HEK 293 and COS- 7 cell lines where it is both sufficient and necessary for silencing either an SV 40 -, or a CMV-enhancer. It also represses the basal activity of an SV 40 core promoter.

The objective of this work was to identify the cis-acting elements responsible for CAR 1 transcriptional activation and response to inducer. We identified three upstream activation sequences (UASs) that support transcriptional activation in a heterologous expression vector. Two of these UAS elements function in the absence of inducer, whereas the third functions only when inducer is present. One of the inducer-independent UAS elements exhibits significant homology to the Sp 1 factor-binding sites identified in simian virus 40 and various mammalian genes...|$|E
40|$|Transcription of {{the three}} unlinked, {{homologous}} STA 1 - 3 glucoamylase-encoding genes, involved in starch degradation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was previously shown to be down-regulated {{by the presence of}} STA 10, acting via three upstream <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> regions that were identified in the STA 2 promoter. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a putative transcriptional activator gene, MSS 10 (multicopy suppressor of STA 10), which, when present in multiple copies, overcomes STA 10 repression. Deletion of MSS 10, located on chromosome XV, resulted in media-specific extinction of glucoamylase synthesis. The nucleotide sequence of MSS 10 is identical to three other genes from S. cerevisiae identified as: FUP 1, a gene that enhances iron-limited growth; PHD 2, a gene identified for its ability to induce pseudohyphal growth in diploid cells grown on nitrogen-limited media; and MSN 1, a gene encoding a transcriptional activator involved in invertase regulation.

40|$|Depending on {{promoter}} context, YY 1 can activate or repress transcription, {{or provide}} {{a site for}} transcription initiation. To investigate whether the ability of YY 1 to induce DNA bending influenced its ability to activate and repress transcription, simple synthetic promoters were constructed in which the YY 1 binding site was inserted between the TATA box and either the NF 1 or AP 1 recognition sequences. In transient transfections of COS cells, the NF 1 YY 1 TATA and NF 1 RYY 1 TATA promoters exhibited a dramatic 15 - 20 -fold increase in correctly initiated transcription. These promoters exhibited even larger 60 - 80 -fold increases in transcription in HeLa cells. Neither multiple copies of the YY 1 binding site alone, nor placement of a YY 1 site upstream of the NF 1 site activated transcription. Deletion of 4 bp between the NF 1 and YY 1 sites, which changes the phase of the DNA bends, abolished the 16 -fold activation of transcription by NF 1 YY 1 TATA. Insertion of the YY 1 site between the AP 1 site and the TATA box decreased transcription approximately 3 -fold. Replacing the YY 1 binding site with an intrinsic DNA bending sequence mimicked this transcription <b>repression.</b> <b>Sequences</b> of similar length which do not bend DNA fail to repress AP 1 -mediated transcription. Gel mobility shift assays were used to show that binding of YY 1 to its recognition sequence did not repress binding of AP 1 to its recognition sequences. Our data indicate that YY 1 -induced DNA bending may activate and repress transcription by changing the spatial relationships between transcription activators and components of the basal transcription apparatus...|$|R

Two of the UAS elements, UASC 1 and UASC 2, operate in an inducer-independent manner, while the third, UASI, is inducer dependent. UASC 1 and UASC 2 were previously shown to contain ABF- 1 binding sites that were required for normal transcription. In this work, we demonstrate that UASC 1 and UASC 2 also contain two and three sites, respectively, that are able to bind RAP 1 protein. RAP 1 binding to these sites, however, is significantly weaker than that to sites in TEF 2 and HMRE. The effects of mutating the sites individually or in combination suggest that at least three of them, two in UASC 1 and one in UASC 2, probably participate in CAR 1 expression...|$|E

It encodes a bZIP (basic-leucine zipper) protein of 230 amino acids with close homology to the mammalian ATF/CREB transcription factor and gel-retardation assays showed that it binds specifically to the CRE motif. HAC 1 is not essential for viability. However, the hac 1 disruptant becomes caffeine sensitive, which is suppressed by multicopy expression of the yeast PDE 2 (Phosphodiesterase 2) gene. Although the mRNA level of HAC 1 is almost constitutive throughout the cell cycle, it fluctuates during meiosis. The upstream region of the HAC 1 gene contains a T 4 C site, a URS (upstream <b>repression</b> <b>sequence)</b> and a TR (T-rich) box-like sequence, which reside upstream of many meiotic genes.

Because SAR is a costly process, SAR-associated transcription must be tightly regulated. Arabidopsis thaliana SNI 1 (for Suppressor of NPR 1, Inducible) is a negative regulator of SAR required to dampen the basal {{expression of}} PR genes. Whole genome transcriptional profiling showed that in the sni 1 mutant, Nonexpresser of PR genes (NPR 1) â€“dependent benzothiadiazole S-methylesterâ€“responsive genes were specifically derepressed. Interestingly, SNI 1 also repressed transcription when expressed in yeast, suggesting that it functions as an active transcriptional repressor through a highly conserved mechanism.

One hypothesis to explain this effect is from the activity of helicase, which unwinds the RNA:DNA heteroduplex ahead of RNA pol II when the sgRNA is complementary to exons of the template strand. In prokaryotes, this steric inhibition can repress transcription of the target gene by almost 99.9%. Whereas in human cells, up to 90% repression was observed.|$|R

In the absence of H-NS, the VirB protein had no additive effect {{on the ability of}} the icsB promoter to form an open transcription complex, indicating that VirB is not involved in the recruitment of RNA polymerase to the promoter or in open complex formation. Similarly, VirB did not stimulate promoter function in an in vitro transcription assay but acted as an antagonist of H-NS-mediated <b>repression.</b> A <b>sequence</b> located upstream of the icsB promoter and related to cis-acting elements involved in plasmid partitioning was required for promoter derepression by VirB.

In this study, we found that both pellicle formation and FLO 11 expression by a wild pellicle-forming strain of S. cerevisiae isolated from contaminated wine were repressed in a glucose-containing medium. Substitution of the promoter region of FLO 11 in the cells with a constitutive promoter caused derepression of pellicle formation in the glucose-containing medium and wine. These findings indicate that glucose repression of the expression of the FLO 11 gene, but not the glucose repression of the expression of other glucose-repressed genes, is responsible for the glucose-dependent regulation of pellicle formation by the wild pellicle-forming yeast strain. Furthermore, we found that the wild pellicle-forming strain had the same deletion of the 111 -bp <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> in the FLO 11 promoter as the flor strains commercially used for making sherry-like wines.

One, which was precisely defined to a region of 20 base pairs, contains two TATA-like elements. Two upstream activating sequences (UAS 15 b and UAS 2 (5 b)) and an upstream <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> (URS 5 b) were also found.

One of the HSEs, HSE 2, is important in the basal expression of SSA 1 as well as in heat-inducible expression. A promoter containing a mutant HSE 2 showed a fivefold-lower level of basal expression and altered kinetics of expression after heat shock. A series of deletion and point mutations led to identification of an upstream <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> (URS) which overlapped HSE 2. A promoter containing a mutation in the URS showed an increased level of basal expression. A URS-binding activity was detected in yeast whole-cell extracts by a gel electrophoresis DNA-binding assay.

40|$|DNA {{methylation}} is {{a tightly}} regulated epigenetic mark associated with transcriptional <b>repression.</b> Next-generation <b>sequencing</b> of purified methylated DNA obtained from early Xenopus tropicalis embryos demonstrates that this genome is heavily methylated during blastula and gastrula stages. Although DNA methylation is largely absent from transcriptional start sites marked with histone H 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H 3 K 4 me 3), we find both promoters and gene bodies of active genes robustly methylated. In contrast, DNA methylation is absent in large H 3 K 27 me 3 domains, indicating {{that these two}} repression pathways have different roles. Comparison with chromatin state maps of human ES cells reveals strong conservation of epigenetic makeup and gene regulation between the two systems. Strikingly, genes that are highly expressed in pluripotent cells and in Xenopus embryos but not in differentiated cells exhibit relatively high DNA methylation. Therefore, we tested the repressive potential of DNA methylation using transient and transgenic approaches and show that methylated promoters are robustly transcribed in blastula- and gastrula-stage embryos, but not in oocytes or late embryos. These findings have implications for reprogramming and the epigenetic regulation of pluripotency and differentiation and suggest a relatively open, pliable chromatin state in early embryos followed by reestablished methylation-dependent transcriptional repression during organogenesis and differentiation...|$|R

Here we demonstrate that three homologous DNA sequences originally reported {{to be present in}} the inducer-responsive UASI are in fact three exchangeable elements (UASI-A, UASI-B, and UASI-C). Although two of these elements, either the same or different ones, are required for transcriptional activation to occur, all three are required for maximal levels of induction. The elements operate in all orientations relative to one another and to the TATA sequence. All three UASI elements bind protein(s); protein binding does not require arginine or overproduction of any of the putative arginine pathway regulatory proteins. The UASI-protein complex was also observed even when extracts were derived from arg 80 /argRI or arg 81 /argRII deletion mutants.

Mutations in the A. nidulans xprF and xprG genes have been shown to result in elevated levels of extracellular protease in response to carbon limitation. The xprF gene was isolated and sequence analysis indicates that it encodes a 615 -amino-acid protein, which represents a new type of fungal hexokinase or hexokinase-like protein. In addition to their catalytic role, hexokinases are thought to be involved in triggering carbon catabolite <b>repression.</b> <b>Sequence</b> analysis of the xprF 1 and xprF 2 alleles showed that both alleles contain nonsense mutations. No loss of glucose or fructose phosphorylating activity was detected in xprF 1 or xprF 2 mutants. There are two possible explanations for this observation: (1) the xprF gene may encode a minor hexokinase or (2) the xprF gene may encode a protein with no hexose phosphorylating activity. Genetic evidence suggests that the xprF and xprG genes are involved in the same regulatory pathway. Support for this hypothesis was provided by the identification of a new class of xprG(-) mutation that suppresses the xprF 1 mutation and results in a protease-deficient phenotype...|$|E

A fragment containing this upstream <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> (URS 1) repressed gene expression when placed either 5 ' or 3 ' to the upstream activation sequences of the heterologous gene CYC 1. Action of the URS and its cognate repressor was overcome by CAR 1 induction when the URS was situated cis to the CAR 1 flanking sequences. This was not observed, however, when it was situated downstream of a heterologous CYC 1 upstream activation sequence indicating that URS function is specifically neutralized by cis-acting elements associated with CAR 1 induction. Searches of sequences in various gene banks revealed that URS 1 -like sequences occur ubiquitously in genetic regulatory regions including those of bacteriophage lambda, yeast, mammalian, and viral genes. In a significant number of cases the sequence is contained in a region associated with negative control of yeast gene regulation.

This growth defect is partially restored by supplying aspartate or threonine, and fully with glutamate or proline supplement. Surprisingly, this phenotype is not observed on complete medium lacking either of these amino acids.

We show that two HDACs, RPD 3 and HOS 2, are required for the activation of DNA damage-inducible genes RNR 3 and HUG 1. Using mutants specific for the Rpd 3 L complex, we show that the complex is responsible for regulating RNR 3. Furthermore, unlike what was described for the GAL genes, Rpd 3 L regulates the activation of RNR 3 by deacetylating nucleosomes at the promoter, not at the open reading frame. Rpd 3 is recruited to the upstream <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> of RNR 3, which surprisingly does not require Tup 1 or Crt 1.

The UIS element mediates inhibition of URS-mediated function when inducer is present. We cloned and characterized the DAL 81 gene and identified the element with which it was associated. The gene was found to encode a rare 3. 2 -kilobase-pair mRNA. The amount of DAL 81 -specific RNA responded neither to induction nor to nitrogen catabolite repression. Deletion of the DAL 81 gene resulted in loss of induction but did not significantly affect basal level expression of the DAL 7 and DUR 1, 2 genes or the UAS and URS functions present in plasmid constructions. These data suggest that (i) transcriptional activation of the DAL genes and their responses to inducer are mediated by different factors and cis-acting sequences and (ii) the UIS functions only when a wild-type DAL 81 gene product is available...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of histone methylation {{have emerged as}} an important issue since the identification of histone demethylases. We studied the regulatory function of Rph 1 /KDM 4 (lysine demethylase), a histone H 3 K 36 demethylase, on transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Overexpression of Rph 1 reduced the expression of PHR 1 and increased UV sensitivity. The catalytically deficient mutant (H 235 A) of Rph 1 diminished the repressive transcriptional effect on PHR 1 expression, which indicates that histone demethylase activity contributes to transcriptional repression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that Rph 1 was associated at the upstream <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> of PHR 1 through zinc-finger domains and was dissociated after UV irradiation. Notably, overexpression of Rph 1 and H 3 K 36 A mutant reduced histone acetylation at the URS, which implies a crosstalk between histone demethylation and acetylation at the PHR 1 promoter. In addition, the crucial checkpoint protein Rad 53 acted as an upstream regulator of Rph 1 and dominated the phosphorylation of Rph 1 that was required for efficient PHR 1 expression and the dissociation of Rph 1. The release of Rph 1 from chromatin also required the phosphorylation at S 652. Our study demonstrates that the histone demethylase Rph 1 {{is associated with a}} specific chromatin locus and modulates histone modifications to repress a DNA damage responsive gene under control of damage checkpoint signaling...|$|E
40|$|Gene {{activity}} is positively or negatively regulated by transcription factors that bind to cis-acting regulatory sequences. In addition, gene expression is enforced by epigenetics, DNA interactions, and chromatin domains through mechanisms that span from modifications {{of the underlying}} DNA sequence up to higher order chromatin organization in the nucleus. This thesis discusses two gene silencing mechanisms in maize and Arabidopsis. The RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway is, among others, involved in the in trans <b>repression</b> of <b>sequences</b> by homologous paramutagenic loci. The investigation of DNA methylation and chromatin structure of two RdDM-dependent, paramutagenic loci in maize revealed two distinct, extreme profiles, representing the endpoints of a negative correlation among RdDM loci in maize between the levels of DNA methylation in CHH context (where H = A,T or C) and histone H 3 -dimethylation at lysine 9. The inverse gradient of the two silencing marks emphasizes the variability of RdDM loci. Additionally, it was investigated whether polycomb-dependent chromatin cluster as they exist in vertebrates can be found as well in Arabidopsis. Polycomb silencing at the FLC gene is induced by cold treatment, which allowed a spatial-temporal study of this gene upon repression. During the cold treatment a general, transient increase of interactions with sequences on other chromosomes was noticed, indicating a cold-stress induced chromatin decompaction that results in changes in the higher-order chromatin organization. Furthermore, once the FLC gene is repressed by polycomb, it interacts preferably with other closely located polycomb targets rather than with non-polycomb targets...|$|R
40|$|Transcriptional {{repression}} of the a-specific genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Î± cells involves the concerted action of several proteins. The homeodomain protein Î± 2, together with MCM 1, recruits two general transcriptional repressors, SSN 6 and TUP 1, to the promoters of a-specific genes. SSN 6 and TUP 1 then mediate {{repression of}} the a-specific genes. SIN 4, another general negative regulator, is required for this repression, but unlike tup 1 or ssn 6 deletions, sin 4 deletions cause only partial loss of repression. We have screened for other genes required for a-specific gene repression in Î± cells. In addition to recovering multiple alleles of previously identified genes required for this process (referred to as Î± 2 repression), we have identified four other genes, designated ARE 1, ARE 2, ARE 3, and ARE 4 (for alpha 2 repression). Recessive mutations in the ARE genes cause partial loss of a-specific gene repression and cause pleiotropic phenotypes similar to those resulting from mutations in SSN 6, TUP 1, or SIN 4, suggesting that the ARE genes are general negative regulators. Based on our initial analysis, we propose that two distinct classes of general negative regulators cooperate to bring about full levels of Î± 2 <b>repression.</b> The <b>sequence</b> of ARE 1 revealed that it encodes a CDC 28 -related protein kinase, identical to UME 5, and thus suggests that protein phosphorylation {{plays a role in}} Î± 2 repression...|$|R
40|$|OspZ is an {{effector}} protein of {{the type}} III secretion system in Shigella spp. that downregulates the human inflammatory response during bacterial infection. The ospZ gene {{is located on the}} large virulence plasmid of Shigella. Many genes on this plasmid are transcriptionally repressed by the nucleoid structuring protein H-NS and derepressed by VirB, a DNA-binding protein that dis-plays homology to the plasmid partitioning proteins ParB and SopB. In this study, we characterized the ospZ promoter and in-vestigated its regulation by H-NS and VirB in Shigella flexneri. We show that H-NS represses and VirB partially derepresses the ospZ promoter. H-NS-mediated <b>repression</b> requires <b>sequences</b> located between 731 and 412 relative {{to the beginning of the}} ospZ gene. Notably, the VirB-dependent derepression of ospZ requires the same VirB binding sites as are required for the VirB-dependent derepression of the divergent icsP gene. These sites are centered 425 bp upstream of the ospZ gene but over 1 kb up-stream of the icsP transcription start site. Although these VirB binding sites lie closer to ospZ than icsP, the VirB-dependent in-crease in ospZ promoter activity is lower than that observed at the icsP promoter. This indicates that the proximity of VirB binding sites to Shigella promoters does not necessarily correlate with the level of VirB-dependent derepression. These findings have implications for virulence gene regulation in Shigella and other pathogens that control gene expression using mechanisms of transcriptional repression and derepression. Shigella species are Gram-negative, nonmotile rods that arecausative agents of bacillary dysentery. The pathogenesis of Shigella spp. is primarily attributed to a large virulence plasmi...|$|R
