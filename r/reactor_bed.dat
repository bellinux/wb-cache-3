50|$|The solid {{substrate}} (the {{catalytic material}} upon which chemical species react) {{material in the}} fluidized bed reactor is typically supported by a porous plate, known as a distributor. The fluid is then forced through the distributor up through the solid material. At lower fluid velocities, the solids remain in place as the fluid passes through the voids in the material. This {{is known as a}} packed bed reactor. As the fluid velocity is increased, the reactor will reach a stage where the force of the fluid on the solids is enough to balance the weight of the solid material. This stage is known as incipient fluidization and occurs at this minimum fluidization velocity. Once this minimum velocity is surpassed, the contents of the <b>reactor</b> <b>bed</b> begin to expand and swirl around much like an agitated tank or boiling pot of water. The reactor is now a fluidized bed. Depending on the operating conditions and properties of solid phase various flow regimes can be observed in this reactor.|$|E

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{increase in}} the global demand for a cleaner energy source has instigated much interest in converting natural gas to ultra-clean fuels and value-added chemicals. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) is a key technology for converting syngas, produced from coal, biomass or natural gas, {{into a variety of}} hydrocarbon products. Although this technology has been around for decades, commercial development remains relatively slow and limited to use of few reactor configurations (e. g. fixed-bed reactor and slurry-bubble column reactor). On the lab-scale, supercritical solvents were utilized in FTS as a reaction media since they have the advantages of both the gas-phase reaction (fixed-bed reactor) and the liquid-phase reaction (slurry-bubble column reactor), while simultaneously overcoming their limitations. This work focuses on modeling the behavior in the <b>reactor</b> <b>bed</b> (?macro-scale? assessment) and then zooming into the catalyst pellet itself (?micro-scale? assessment). The aim of this research is to simulate the heat and mass transfer behavior inside the <b>reactor</b> <b>bed,</b> identify typical conditions that look at the existence and absence of both mass and heat transfer limitations, and to quantify the role of the main controlling parameters on the overall behavior of the <b>reactor</b> <b>bed</b> and on the catalyst effectiveness factor. An often used mathematical model of the fixed-bed reactor was applied to simulate the concentration and temperature profile simultaneously based on the appropriate mass and heat balances at both scales. A second-order ordinary differential equation was used for a spherical pellet in the radial coordinate for both mass and heat balances, while a one-dimensional steady state pseudo heterogeneous model was used for the <b>reactor</b> <b>bed</b> modeling in the axial direction. In addition, in both models the mass balance equation was expressed in terms of fugacity to account for the non-ideal behavior of the reaction mixture in the SCF-FTS. The thermodynamic properties of the mixture were estimated using the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state (SRK-EOS). The simulation results of this study showed a high temperature rise in the gas- phase FTS relative to that in the SCF-FTS under a comparable reaction conditions. Carbon monoxide conversion was considerably higher in the SCF compared to the gas- phase reaction.
