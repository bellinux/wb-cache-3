40|$|ABSTRACT Immature human infants develop <b>retrolental</b> <b>fibroplasia</b> in {{the absence}} of oxygen abuse, though {{fortunately}} much less frequently and to a less severe degree than in its presence. The incidence of acute stage <b>retrolental</b> <b>fibroplasia</b> among 173 infants weighing less than 2, 500 g who were cared for at the Pennsylvania Hospital from 1968 to 1972 was 19 % with an incidence of 32 % in the 1, 000 - to 1, 500 -g weight group and of 75 % among the six survivors in the 1, 000 -g weight category. The severity of the disease did not usually exceed grade 2 active <b>retrolental</b> <b>fibroplasia</b> but six instances of grade 3 disease and one of grade 4 were noted. The infants eyes were examined weekly by indirect ophthalmoscopy during the period of hospitalization. A follow-up after age 1 year is in progress with preliminary results indicating an incidence of cicatricial disease of 90 % and of other eye patholgy (myopia, strabismus) of 80 %. Both FIO 2 and PaO 2 are carefully monitored in our nurseries. Human retinal vessels normally develop entirely in the intrauterine environment. They are peculiarly sensitive to changes in 02 tension. Therefore, in the prematurely born, these vessels are exposed to abnormally high 02 tensions even {{in the absence}} of 02 therapy.

40|$|THE {{evidence}} for regarding an abnormal overgrowth {{of the developing}} retinal vessels as the pathological basis of <b>retrolental</b> <b>fibroplasia</b> has been reviewed and discussed in an earlier paper in this issue (Ashton, 1954 a). This fundamental dysplasia considered alone appeared to indicate thatthe disease was probably {{no more than a}} violent " activation of the normal process of retinal vascularization, so that the narrow confines of the nerve fibre layer could no longer contain the exuberant vaso-formative tissue, which conse-quently burst through the limiting membrane to invade the vitreous and so initiated a train of events terminating in total retinal detachment and the formation of a retrolental fibrous membrane. The stimulus which normally attracts the vessels into the retina is itself unknown, but it has been assumed, in general terms, to be a response to the oxygen demands of the inner layers of the retina, which the choroidal circulation is no longer able to satisfy as the eye develops. If <b>retrolental</b> <b>fibroplasia</b> began simply as an overgrowth of normal vaso-formative tissue, it seemed possible that it might occur in response to a stimulus identical in nature with the normal but excessive in degree, a variation which thus appeared to be related to a disparity between oxygen supply and demand.

40|$|SUMMARY Fifteen to 20 % of {{premature}} infants weighing below 1500 g develop variable degrees of acute <b>retrolental</b> <b>fibroplasia</b> (RLF). Approximately 5 % of those infants who develop RLF {{can be expected}} to become blind. A prospective study was carried out to evaluate if early cryopexy can prevent this blindness. The study showed that, among 533 infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit between July 1976 and December 1978, 55 had some degree of active RLF. In 18 eyes of 9 infants in whom the retinopathy progressed beyond active stage II cryopexy treatment was applied to the avascular retina. In all the treated eyes the active retinopathy regressed, and there were no complications due to the procedure. The long-term follow-up showed that in 15 eyes there was good vision and that the remaining 3 eyes had some impairment of vision but were not blind.
