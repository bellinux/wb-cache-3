5|$|According to John of Salisbury, {{who first}} {{reported}} {{this story in}} 1172 {{after the death of}} Thomas Becket, as a young clerk <b>Roger</b> was involved in a scandal involving a homosexual relationship with a boy named Walter. After Walter made the relationship public, <b>Roger</b> reacted by embroiling Walter in judicial case that ended with Walter's eyes being gouged out. When Walter then accused <b>Roger</b> of this crime, <b>Roger</b> persuaded a judge to condemn Walter to death by hanging. Becket supposedly was involved in the cover-up afterwards, by arranging with Hilary of Chichester and John of Coutances for <b>Roger</b> to swear an oath that he was innocent. According to John of Salisbury, <b>Roger</b> then went to Rome in 1152 and was cleared of involvement by Pope Eugene III. John of Salisbury further alleges that it was only after bribery that the pope cleared <b>Roger.</b> Frank Barlow, a medieval historian and Becket's biographer, points out in his biography of Becket that while <b>Roger</b> was accused of these crimes, and may even have been guilty of some sort of criminal homosexuality, John of Salisbury's motives for bringing up this story in 1172 were almost certainly to defame <b>Roger.</b> Such a story would naturally have put <b>Roger</b> in the worst possible light.|$|E

As a result, <b>Roger</b> led the baronial opposition to Edward's request for additional taxes and support for his French wars. Edward responded by seizing Roger's lands and only releasing them on the condition that <b>Roger</b> granted them to the Crown after his death. <b>Roger</b> agreed and Framlingham Castle passed to the Crown on his death in 1306.|$|E

In retaliation Becket excommunicated <b>Roger</b> in late 1170, and some have seen this excommunication as one reason for King Henry's anger at Becket which led to Becket's martyrdom. After being suspended from office by the pope for his supposed role in Becket's death, <b>Roger</b> was eventually restored to office in late 1171, and died in 1181.
