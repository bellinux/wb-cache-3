50|$|The {{filing fee}} for Form I-129 is $460. Forms are {{automatically}} expedited given the seasonal and time-sensitive nature of agricultural work, {{but it is}} also possible to <b>request</b> <b>Premium</b> Processing Service for $1225 to get an initial response within 15 calendar days.|$|R
5000|$|Data skewed by Premium Processing: The USCIS {{does not}} {{separate}} out data for petitions that have <b>requested</b> the <b>Premium</b> Processing Service, i.e., its estimate of processing time includes both petitions that have <b>requested</b> <b>Premium</b> Processing {{and those that}} have not. While this does not affect form categories ineligible for Premium Processing, it does skew the reported processing times for the forms eligible for Premium Processing. For instance, a Form I-129 petition {{that did not have}} a <b>Premium</b> Processing Service <b>request</b> will likely take more time to process than the processing time reported by the USCIS.|$|R

50|$|Starting March 2013, USCIS has {{generally}} announced a delayed start date {{from which to}} start the 15-day counter for premium processing for cap-subject petitions for the H-1B visa. This {{has been done in}} anticipation of a huge load of applications and the need to prioritize data collection about all applications. In other words, applicants who <b>requested</b> the <b>Premium</b> Processing Service should expect a response within 15 days of the delayed start date rather than within 15 days of the USCIS receiving the application.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a website host server with web {{quality of service}} (QoS) capabilities to offer differentiated services. A quantitative modelling framework is set up to analyse the economic benefits of differentiated services and to build optimization models for managing the website host 2 ̆ 7 s connection bandwidth to the Internet (which {{is assumed to be}} the bottleneck factor determining the QoS). Three models are formulated corresponding to three operational scenarios to provide differentiated services. The first is for the marketing manager to classify visit <b>requests</b> as <b>premium</b> or basic when the information technology (IT) manager has already reserved bandwidths for the two classes, and the second is for the IT manager to allocate the total available bandwidth to each class when the marketing manager has already designated which visit <b>requests</b> are <b>premium</b> and which are basic. The third is for the joint optimization of request classification and bandwidth allocation when centralized coordination is possible. Analytic results are obtained for a special case that corresponds to very impatient customers requesting large amounts of data. Qualitative insights gained and numerical results obtained strongly support the implementation of differentiated services. More interestingly, the decentralized models that use simple and rough-cut rules yield solutions almost as good as the joint optimization model...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a multi-item spare parts problem with multiple warehouses and two customer classes, where lateral transshipments {{are used as}} a differentiation tool. Specifically, <b>premium</b> <b>requests</b> that cannot be met from stock at their preferred warehouse may be satisfied from stock at other warehouses (so-called lateral transshipments). We first derive approximations for the mean waiting time per class in a single-item model with selective lateral transshipments. Next, we embed our method in a multi-item model minimizing the holding costs and costs of lateral and emergency shipments from upstream locations in the network. Compared to the option of using only selective emergency shipments for differentiation, the addition of selective lateral transshipments can lead to significant further cost savings (14 % on average) ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose new methods to measure the {{effective}} exposure to country risk of emerging-market companies. Starting from Damodaran (2003), we propose seven new approaches and a revised CAPM for emerging markets companies. The “Prospective Lambda” represents the effective exposure according to analysts’ estimates of growth. The “Relative Lambda” relies on the firm value estimated through a relative valuation. The “Retrospective Lambda” represents the ex-post effective exposure to country risk. The “Company Effective Risk Premium” is a generalization of the Retrospective Lambda, and expresses the <b>premium</b> effectively <b>requested</b> by investors to invest in that specific company in the past year. “The Actual Lambda” and the “Company Actual Risk Premium” represent, respectively, the actual exposure to country risk of a company and the actual <b>premium</b> <b>requested</b> by investors to invest in that specific company. The “Industry Lambda” reflects the median exposure to country risk of the industry in which the company belongs. We tested our new measures of exposure to country risk on the Latin American emerging markets companies according to the classification of the MSCI Emerging Markets Latin America Index. The results confirm that the new approaches can be effectively applied by financial analysts to stable-growth companies that operate in emerging markets and to mature markets companies that operate in emerging markets, providing with a more reliable estimate of both the <b>premium</b> effectively <b>requested</b> by investors in the past and the actual premium. Applying the new approaches, the cost of equity reflects the effective exposure of a company to country risk without being over- or underestimated, as is the case with other existing approaches...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the forward premium anomaly (FPA) {{in a continuous}} time framework. Given the ultra high-frequency nature of the currency market, a con-tinuous time approach is, in many ways, attractive. We derive a no arbitrage condition for a currency exchange market in continuous time and then test whether this condition holds. In particular, the condition implies that the volatility of spot exchange returns, {{as well as the}} risk <b>premium</b> <b>requested</b> by spot traders, are functions of differences in the market prices of risk between the two countries. Moreover, it reveals that, even in the simplest case where there is no market price of risk differential, the conventional FPA tests based on discrete time models will be invalid and subject to data misaggre-gation bias unless the expectation hypothesis holds continuously at all frequencies and maturities. To empirically evaluate our continuous time regression model, we employ a novel econometric methodology based on a time change from calender to volatility time. Specifically, our method requires collection of samples at random intervals having the same level of excess exchange return volatility. This amounts to using a sampling chronometer that runs at a rate inversely proportional to the volatility. By doing so, we may effectively make the distributions of residuals into independent standard normals, nonparametrically correcting for the non-normality and time-varying stochastic volatil-ity typically present in exchange return data. The model is estimated and tested by minimizing the distance between the sampling distributions of residuals and the stan-dard normal distribution. We apply our methodology to exchange rates between the US dollar and six other major currencies. Our results are unambiguous and robust: In every case, the FPA disappears. ∗This document is a draft and in not for distribution or citation. †The {{authors would like to thank}} the Program for Time Series with Applications in Financial Economic...|$|R
