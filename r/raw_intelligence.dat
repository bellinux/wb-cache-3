500|$|The CIA's 1995 damage {{assessment}} report singled out former SE Division reports chief Robert Lubbehusen for sending reports without disclosing {{that they were}} from double agents, despite Agency rules requiring warnings on such reports. He and other mid-level officers allegedly saw the controlled-agent reporting as genuine and feared that revealing the reports' sources would distract officials from the supposedly valuable intelligence. He may have also been swayed by pressure from the Defense Department for more intelligence. According to reporter James Risen, reports officers were sometimes more knowledgeable about CIA sources than case officers, and were [...] "often {{the first to see}} the <b>raw</b> <b>intelligence</b> and thus had the opportunity to describe the sources in the reports." [...] Following approval by the SE Division's chief, CIA intelligence analysts would then view the reports, but had to rely on the reports officers to describe the sources. However, one anonymous source backed Lubbehusen, saying that some of the intelligence may have been genuine material sent by the Soviets to bolster their moles' bona fides. Even after Lubbehusen was removed, his successors continued to leave out disclosures on reports, although Lubbehusen's reprimand was reputedly the strongest of the seven Deutch issued.|$|E

The aim and ambition of the MICA project is to contribute to the emerging raw materials knowledge infrastructure in Europe (section 1). Stakeholder groups with stakes in <b>raw</b> material <b>intelligence</b> are identified, defined and classified according to a tailored methodology (section 2).

Washington forwarded none of the <b>raw</b> <b>intelligence</b> it had, and little of its intelligence estimates (after analysis), to Hawaiian commanders, Admiral Husband E.

50|$|Many {{attempts}} have been made to locate Ibrahim by the Indian intelligence agencies, Research and Analysis Wing (<b>RAW)</b> and <b>Intelligence</b> Bureau (IB), ever since he went into hiding. His location has been frequently traced to Karachi, Pakistan, a claim which the Pakistani authorities have frequently denied. The claims were further established in August 2015, when a phone call made to his home by an Indian television channel, Times Now, was answered by his wife, who confirmed his presence at their home in Karachi. The Indian intelligence agencies immediately prepared a dossier of Ibrahim which included evidences of his location in Karachi, among others. It was to be presented at the National Security Agency-level talks between the two countries in the same month, which was however, called off due to political reasons.|$|R
