25|$|In October 1993, The Straits Times, Singapore's main English-language newspaper, {{reported}} that car vandalism in Singapore {{was on the}} rise. Cars parked at apartment blocks were being damaged with hot tar, paint remover, red spray paint, and hatchets. Taxi drivers complained that their tires were slashed. In the city center, cars were found with deep scratches and dents. One man complained {{that he had to}} <b>refinish</b> his car six times in six months.|$|E
25|$|The National Park Service {{chose to}} <b>refinish</b> the statues using brush electroplating. Workers {{discovered}} {{that because the}} interior of each pedestal was exposed to bare earth, excessive condensation built up inside the hollow statues. Additionally, the statues had not been completely seated on their plinths, and additional moisture worked its way inside through the poorly sealed joint. Extreme temperature changes (due to daytime heating and nighttime cooling of the bronze) and proximity to the river also led to extensive condensation inside the statures. Workers found the interior of each statue damp, even wet, and water pooled in every recess. The moisture build-up created tremendous galvanic corrosion inside the sculptures. The steel joint bolts were so extensively corroded that some had almost completely disintegrated, {{and many of the}} steel angle irons were close to failure. National Bureau of Standards workers believed all four statues {{were on the verge of}} structural collapse. The corrosion problem was worsened by the presence of gypsum. Gypsum was used to make the molds from which the bronze was cast. But the gypsum was never completely cleaned from the interior of the two The Arts of Peace statues, leading to additional corrosion in these pieces. The corrosion problems were solved by removing the steel bolts and angle irons and replacing them with bronze components, and by cleaning as much gypsum as possible from the statue interiors. More than 1,000 brass bolts were used in Music and Harvest and Aspiration and Literature alone.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of <b>refinishing</b> process on dental ceramics roughness and the effect of bleaching treatment with 16 % carbamide peroxide. Materials and methods: Specimens of 5 x 3 x 1 mm were produced in two groups (n= 14 per group) of dental ceramics following manufacturers' instructions: IPS d. Sign (Ivoclar-Vivadent); and VMK- 95 (Vita). A profilometer was used to evaluate the surface roughness (Ra values) of all ceramics acquiring 3 profiles with five 0. 25 mm cut-off (λc) at 0. 1 mm/s, in four times. The first time was baseline as a negative control, followed by bur roughening (91 - 126 µm-grit) to simulate an oclusal adjustment in the second time (positive control). After that, the specimens were submitted to <b>refinishing</b> treatments with diamond burs with fine (2135 F – 37 - 44 µm-grit) and extra fine (2135 FF – 20 - 40 µm-grit) diamond burs (third time); and polishing with abrasive cups and paste (fourth time). After <b>refinishing,</b> the two ceramics were divided into a bleached (BL) and non-bleached (NB), with 4 subgroups (n= 7 per group). Bleaching was performed daily for 6 -hours with 16 % carbamide peroxide for 21 days, while NB groups were stored in artificial saliva. The effect of <b>refinishing</b> treatment on ceramics were evaluated by to 2 -way ANOVA and Tukey’s test; bleaching effect on <b>refinished</b> ceramics were evaluated by T test. Results: There were no statistical significant differences on surface roughness between ceramics on each <b>refinishing</b> treatments times. The adjustment of dental ceramics with diamond burs drastically increases the surface roughness. The solely treatment with fine and extra fine diamond bur reduced but did not reverse the ceramic surface roughness. The sequential <b>refinishing</b> with abrasive cups and paste reverted the surface roughness to values similar to baseline. Bleaching treatment did not affect the surface roughness of <b>refinished</b> ceramics. Conclusion: Acceptable surface roughness was obtained after <b>refinishing</b> with polishing abrasive cups and paste. The 16 % carbamide peroxide treatment was not able to alter the <b>refinished</b> ceramic surface roughness...|$|R

40|$|<b>Refinishing</b> process such as Hot Solder Dip (HSD) {{process can}} be used to prevent tin whisker growth in {{microelectronics}} components by replacing the lead-free finishes with conventional tin–lead coatings. In some applications, it is also used to ensure reliable solder joints by replacing contaminated finishes and lead-free alloys with tin–lead to result in a homogeneous solder joint with tin–lead paste. In this paper, the impact of a HSD <b>refinishing</b> process on leaded components was statistically studied by comparing the electrical test data of <b>refinished</b> samples with those not-refinished. The likely damage from the component <b>refinishing</b> was thought to be the degradation of package integrity through thermo-mechanical stressing. This might be detectable as a microscopic leakage current if moisture could be encouraged into any open areas. Ten types of leaded components were selected and samples for each type of the component were allocated into 2 lots, one for <b>refinishing</b> and one used as a control. 150 cycles − 65 / 150 °C thermal cycling followed by 500 h 85 %RH/ 85 °C humidity test was applied to all the samples (both <b>refinished</b> and not-refinished) to amplify any incipient failure points and accelerate moisture ingress into the package. Electrical test was then carried out to measure any small changes in current under zero and reverse bias conditions. In the end, a data reduction process in conjunction with a statistical hypothesis test was used to analyze the electrical test data. The results showed that {{there was no significant difference}} between the measured currents of <b>refinished</b> and not-refinished post-aged samples. Therefore it was concluded that the <b>refinishing</b> process did not have a significant impact on the tested components. This conclusion was further strengthened by other experimental test results such as CSAM images...|$|R
