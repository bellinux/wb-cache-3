40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the concentration of mercury in fish consumed in Marabá, Brazil which is located close to the Serra Pelada gold mines. Methods: Fish species which have great economic impact on the city of Marabá were selected for study in a pilot research programme. The species sampled were collected from fish sold at the Feira da 28, were from the species Cichla spp, Mylossoma spp and Pimelodus spp. The samples were processed through the Allegra method. Results: The measured mercury concentrations were Cichla <b>spp.</b> <b>I</b> (0. 750 kg) 600 μg/kg, Cichla spp. II (1. 254 kg) 1000 μg/kg, Cichla spp III (2. 750 kg) < 2000 μg/kg; Mylossoma <b>spp</b> <b>I</b> (1. 300 kg) 100 μg/kg, Mylossoma spp II (2. 100 kg) < 300 μg/kg; Pimelodus <b>spp</b> <b>I</b> (0. 850 kg) 100 μg/kg, Pimelodus spp II (1. 050 kg) < 300 μg/kg. Conclusions: The concentrations of mercury in the fish samples analysed exceed the limits for consumption established by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Brazilian government. The semi quantitative Allegra method for determination of mercury in environmental samples is confirmed as a suitable alternative for environmental monitoring programs which are relevant to public health.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} land use and crop management on soybean rhizobial communities, 280 nodule isolates were trapped from 7 fields with different land use and culture histories. Besides the known Bradyrhizobium japonicum, three novel genospecies were isolated from these fields. Grassland (GL) maintained a higher diversity of soybean bradyrhizobia than the other cultivation systems. Two genospecies (Bradyrhizobium <b>spp.</b> <b>I</b> and III) were distributed widely in all treatments, while Bradyrhizobium sp. II was found only in GL treatment. Cultivation with soybeans increased the rhizobial abundance and diversity, except for the soybean monoculture (S-S) treatment. In monoculture systems, soybeans favored Bradyrhizobium sp. I, while maize and wheat favored Bradyrhizobium sp. III. Fertilization decreased the rhizobial diversity indexes but did not change the species composition. The organic carbon (OC) and available phosphorus (AP) contents and pH were the main soil parameters positively correlated with the distribution of Bradyrhizobium <b>spp.</b> <b>I</b> and II and Bradyrhizobium japonicum and negatively correlated with Bradyrhizobium sp.

These results revealed that different land uses and crop management could not only alter the diversity and abundance of soybean rhizobia, but also change interactions between rhizobia and legume or nonlegume plants, which offered novel information about the biogeography of rhizobia.

Bryozoans, modular colonial filter feeders, are important competitors in a range of habitats and represent a potentially significant source of diversity. Little work has been done to catalog the Bryozoa of Mo’orea, French Polynesia. By examining coral rubble, artificial substrates and Turbinaria <b>spp.</b> algal fronds, <b>I</b> quantified the distribution of bryozoans in a shallow lagoon and simultaneously recorded their competitive interactions. I also quantified patterns of bryozoan richness and abundance with respect to depth and location. Finally, I conducted an experiment to determine the degree to which predation effects an abundant genus, Rhynchozoon <b>spp.</b> <b>I</b> found more bryozoans further from the barrier reef and in deeper water. There were vastly more cheilostomates than either cyclostomates or ctenostomates, though it remains unclear whether they are competitively dominant. A few genera dominated the epibiotic algal habitat, showing abundance patterns opposite those seen on coral rubble. I did not find any successional patterns on algae. I did not find a significant effect of predation on uncaged Rhynchozoon spp. colonies in the field. This study suggests that abiotic factors may be more important than trophic and competitive interactions in determining bryozoan abundance, but their relative influences remain unclear. This work lays the foundation for future ecological work on factors limiting bryozoans in French Polynesia and provides a guide to the genera found in this study...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{proposes a}} radial basis {{function}} (RBF) neural network-based model for short-term solar power prediction (SPP). Instead of predicting solar power directly, the model predicts transmissivity, {{which is then}} used to obtain solar power according to the extraterrestrial radiation. The proposed model uses a novel two-dimensional (2 D) representation for hourly solar radiation and uses historical transmissivity, sky cover, relative humidity and wind speed as the input. Simulation studies are carried out to validate the proposed model for short-term SPP by using the data obtained from the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB). The performance of the RBF neural network is {{compared with that of}} two linear regression models, i. e., an autoregressive (AR) model and a local linear regression (LLR) model. Results show that the RBF neural network significantly outperforms the AR model and is better than the LLR model. Furthermore, the use of transmissivity and other meteorological variables, especially the sky cover, can significantly improve the SPP performance.

Females of these species are also structurally similar but males differ in major critical characters. Nymphs and larvae of both species parasitize the spiny mouse (Acomys <b>spp.</b> <b>i,</b> but imrnatures of the third African- Arabian species of this subgenus.

40|$|Endosymbiosis in cnidaria-dinoflagellate {{association}} plays {{a critical}} role in regulating growth and productivity of corals and relates marine ecosystems. Cellular endosymbiosis with dinoflagellate Symbiodinium <b>spp.</b> (<b>i.</b> e. the symbiont or “zooxanthellae ” in generic name) within corals (i. e. the host) is initiated by the internalization of symbionts via phagocytic process into host endoderm cells. However, the mechanism by which the symbiont is able to reside at inside of the host cell and establishes an obligatory and mutualistic association still remains ambiguous after four decades of investigation 〔 1 〕. Thus, we tried to use varied molecular and cellular technologies for exploring the molecular mechanism of the endosymbiosis within cnidaria-dinoflagellate〔 2, 3 〕. Fortunately, non-destructive synchrotron-radiation-based infrared microspectroscopy (SR-IMS) and nano-transmission X-ray microscopy (SR-nTXM) also provides a solution for investigating 2 D chemical images and 3 D tomography images within coral tissue, respectively. We have established the suitable protocols for employing these synchrotron-radiation-based technologies to study marine cnidarian sample. The preliminary results of SR-IMS revealed that the chemical composition within symbiotic algae (dinoflatellate) were different at symbiotic or aposymbiotic (free living) state, especially the level of glycogen, ester, phospholipids, nitride related molecules. The SR-nTXM wa...|$|R
40|$|Factors {{controlling}} phytoplankton {{distribution and}} {{activity in the}} marine environment are often poorly understood. Knowledge of genomic content and organization may aid in understanding these processes. To this end, bulk environmental DNA was extracted from Gulf of Mexico seawater and cloned into a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vector to generate a library of 3000 large-insert clones. This library was probed for various types of RubisCO gene (rbcL); 8 rbcL-containing clones (20 to 73 kb in size) were detected and sequenced. rbcL sequences indicated that they originated from marine alpha-Synechococcus spp. Genomic organization was highly {{similar to that of}} the sequenced genome of Synechococcus sp. strain WH 8102 in the region surrounding rbcL. Several differences from known alpha-Synechococcus were also observed, including putative monoamine oxidase and amino acid transport genes, and electron transport, photosynthesis and hypothetical protein genes similar to those of Prochlorococcus <b>spp.</b> (<b>i.</b> e. flavodoxin, thioredoxin reductase and iron-stress-induced chlorophyll-binding proteins). These findings indicate that the order and composition of the carbon fixation operon (cbbX to ccmK) is highly conserved in (x-Synechococcus, while adjacent genomic composition indicates expanded metabolic capabilities obtained from gene-transfer events with Prochlorococcus spp. and other cyanobacteria...|$|R
