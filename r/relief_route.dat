5|$|In the 1980s, {{plans were}} made for a limited-access <b>Relief</b> <b>Route</b> of US 13 between Dover and the Wilmington area that would {{alleviate}} it of traffic heading to the Delaware Beaches in the summer. This <b>Relief</b> <b>Route</b> would become designated as part of DE 1, a route that ran along the Atlantic Ocean in Sussex County and north to Milford. The DE 1 toll road between Dover Air Force Base and Christiana opened in stages between 1991 and 2003. The total cost to build the DE 1 toll road was $900 million {{and it was the}} largest public works project in Delaware history.|$|E
5|$|The final {{piece of}} the <b>Relief</b> <b>Route</b> {{associated}} with US 113 was the Puncheon Run Connector, which would provide a direct connection between US 13 and DE 1 and US 113. The connector and its partial interchange with US 113 were built between 1998 and 2000. In 2003, the same year the last portion of the <b>Relief</b> <b>Route</b> was completed, DelDOT requested US 113 be eliminated from Milford to Dover {{in favor of the}} sole designation of DE 1 from Milford to Dover. AASHTO denied DelDOT's application at their spring 2003 meeting because the state did not address the status of US 113 Alternate. The organization approved DelDOT's application to also eliminate US 113 Alternate in addition to the MilfordDover portion of US 113 at their annual meeting later in 2003. Bay Road became an unnumbered highway between Exit 95 at Dover Air Force Base and the old northern terminus of US113 at US13 in Dover.|$|E
5|$|The major {{intercity}} surface routes from Alamogordo are U.S. Highways 54, 70, and 82, all {{of which}} are four-lane roads. The major north-south street within the city is White Sands Boulevard. The Charlie T.

5|$|U.S. Route 70 and U.S. Route 54 {{traverses}} {{through the}} north and south ends of the city. At {{the south end of the}} city, White Sands Boulevard is a major named street that merges into U.S. Route 54/Charles T. Lee Memorial <b>Relief</b> <b>Route,</b> running south to El Paso, Texas. In the south part of the city, U.S. Route 70 splits from U.S. Route 54 in a southwestern direction towards Holloman Air Force Base, White Sands National Monument, White Sands Missile Range, and Las Cruces. At the north end of the city, White Sands Boulevard and the Charles T. Lee Memorial <b>Relief</b> <b>Route</b> become a merged U.S. Route 54 and U.S. Route 70 running north to Tularosa. U.S. Route 82 starts at the same point and runs east to Cloudcroft and the mountain communities of Otero County, and then to Artesia. Meanwhile, in Tularosa, U.S. 70 and U.S. 54 both split in which U.S. 70 heads east through the mountains, and towards Ruidoso and Roswell, while U.S. 54 heads north towards Carrizozo and keeps going north until it heads east again starting in Vaughn.|$|E
5|$|US 113's role between Milford and Dover became {{secondary}} {{with the}} designation and extension of DE 1 {{throughout the state}} {{in conjunction with the}} proposed US 13 <b>Relief</b> <b>Route,</b> which is now the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway from Dover Air Force Base to Christiana. DE1 was assigned to the Milford Bypass and concurrently with DE 14 along the coastal highway south from Milford to the Maryland state line at Fenwick Island in 1973. DE1 was co-signed with DE14 through the Delaware beach communities until 1976, when DE14 was truncated at Milford. The DE1 designation was extended north by 1988 along US113 from Milford to Dover and continuing north along US13 toward Christiana to connect sections of the <b>Relief</b> <b>Route</b> as they were completed. In 1991, DelDOT enacted corridor preservation measures on DE 1, including its concurrency with US 113, from Dover Air Force Base to Nassau to prevent excessive development along the corridor so it can gradually be transformed into a freeway.|$|E
5|$|With Britain's {{declaration}} of war on the German Empire on 4 August 1914, the government {{took control of the}} railways under the Regulation of the Forces Act 1871. Day-to-day operations were left in the control of local management, but movements necessary for the war were coordinated by a committee of general managers. The Great North of Scotland's main role was providing a <b>relief</b> <b>route</b> when the Highland Railway route south to Perth was congested, on one Sunday conveying twenty-one troop specials from Keith to Aberdeen. Timber from the forests of the north of Scotland were carried from sidings at Kemnay, Knockando and Nethy Bridge. A total of 609 staff left to serve in the war, and a memorial to the 93 who died in action was erected at the offices in Aberdeen. Services were maintained until 1916, when staff shortages reduced services, although no lines were closed.|$|E

40|$|This article {{argues that}} {{multinational}} corporations may provide critical <b>relief</b> <b>routes</b> for women workers' progress in managerial careers in national contexts where their career paths with domestic employers remain blocked by traditional and institutional practices. It illustrates this possibility through {{a study of}} two women managers at the local head office of a foreign-owned multinational retailer in Japan and their career trajectories. The alternative career paths through foreign employers are not without their contingencies and constraints, and the article identifies {{the limitations of the}} transformative potential foreign employers could have in the larger realm of women's managerial employment in a restrictive context such as Japan. Noting that globalization incorporates different groups of workers into the global economy with different costs and rewards, the article concludes by calling for a more nuanced understanding of women's employment with multinationals and for further research that remains cognizant of the multiplicity of experiences in different contexts...|$|R
50|$|At its {{southern}} end, NM-599 {{begins at the}} traffic light controlled intersection of itself, Cerrillos Road (NM-14), and Avenida del Sur about 2 mi south of the municipal boundaries of Santa Fe. The speed limit is 45 mph as the expressway crosses under and connects mostly at-grade with Interstate 25's (I-25) frontage roads and exit ramps (Exit 276), providing intermediate access from the freeway to a horse racetrack, businesses and homes on the frontage road. After a traffic light on the route at I-25's western frontage road, the speed limit increases from 45 to 65 mph for approximately 2 mi, as the expressway travels north up and over two hills, passing {{to the west of}} some of the city's newer neighborhoods and to the east of the Santa Fe Municipal Airport, before slowing again to 45 mph as it approaches the remaining traffic light controlled intersection on the route at Airport Road (former NM-284, now Santa Fe County Road 56). As the highway leaves the industrial and residential area near the intersection with Airport Road, the speed limit increases to 55 mph and it crosses the Santa Fe River. After the river the <b>relief</b> <b>route's</b> western frontage road begins.|$|R
2500|$|Although the {{proposed}} Surrey and Sussex Junction Railway {{had been abandoned}} in 1867, there remained a demand from Croydon to towns such as East Grinstead, Tunbridge Wells and the East Sussex coast. The SER {{was looking for a}} <b>relief</b> <b>route</b> in the same general direction for its Tonbridge and Hastings services, and the two railways collaborated in a joint line between South Croydon, on the main Brighton line, and Oxted. Beyond Oxted, the LB would build its own lines to link with the [...] "Bluebell line" [...] at East Grinstead and its line to Tunbridge Wells. SER trains would join the line between Redhill and Tonbridge. Authority was granted in 1878 and they opened in 1884.|$|E
2500|$|In 1866 the B began {{constructing}} the Metropolitan Branch west out of Washington, and {{was completed in}} 1873 after years of erratic effort. Before this line was laid, rail traffic west of Washington had to travel first to Relay or Baltimore before joining the main line. The line cut {{a more or less}} straight line from Washington to Point of Rocks, Maryland, with many grades and large bridges. Upon the opening of this line, through passenger traffic was rerouted through Washington, and the Old Main Line from Point of Rocks to Relay was reduced to secondary status as far as passenger service was concerned. The Washington to Gaithersburg section of the Met Branch was double-tracked during 1886–1893. Rebuilding in the early 20th century and complete double tracking of the branch by 1928 increased capacity; the [...] "branches" [...] became the de facto mainline, though the Old Main Line was retained as a <b>relief</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Maryland Route 119 (MD 119) is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of Maryland. Also known as Great Seneca Highway, the highway runs [...] from MD 28 in Rockville north to Middlebrook Road in Germantown. MD 119 is a four- to six-lane divided highway that connects several {{residential}} and commercial neighborhoods in Rockville, Gaithersburg, and Germantown. Great Seneca Highway was planned by Montgomery County in the late 1960s as a local <b>relief</b> <b>route</b> for traffic on parallel Interstate 270 (I-270) between the three communities. By the early 1980s, the highway had become controversial because it was proposed to pass through Seneca Creek State Park. A coalition of civic and environmental groups unsuccessfully pursued litigation to stop the highway. The National Park Service refused permission for the county to build the highway in 1985 but reversed itself two years later, by which time the first segment of the highway in Germantown was nearing completion. The RockvilleGaithersburg section was completed in 1989 and the controversial segment through the state park was finished in 1990. Almost all of Great Seneca Highway became MD 119 in 1999.|$|E

5000|$|In 1983, studies began for a [...] "Relief Route" [...] of US 13 between Dover and Wilmington.
