5|$|The Stargazer was to {{originally}} {{be represented}} by the movie-era Enterprise model, but producers were convinced to use a design which had appeared on a model in Picard's <b>ready</b> <b>room</b> in the series pilot. Several camera and compositing techniques were used by Bowman in filming the scenes aboard {{the bridge of the}} Stargazer, which was also a re-dressed movie-era Klingon Bird of Prey bridge set.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Enterprise is {{approaching}} the planet. Picard enters his <b>ready</b> <b>room</b> and finds his belongings {{scattered on the}} floor. He calls in Worf, who cannot explain their displacement. D'Sora arrives at Data's cabin where he is painting. She tells him to continue, but is then annoyed when he does so, causing him some confusion. The ship arrives at the coordinates for the planet but finds nothing there. Then it suddenly appears as the ship's computer warns of a depressurization in the observation lounge. The crew investigate and find all the furniture piled {{in one corner of}} the room.|$|E

5000|$|The report {{touched upon}} {{the issue of}} the {{location}} of ready rooms: It was demonstrated with large loss of life through Kamikaze hits that the gallery deck is not the location for pilots' <b>ready</b> <b>rooms.</b> As many as possible of the <b>ready</b> <b>rooms</b> should be located inboard beneath horizontal armor and protected access to the flight deck should be furnished. BuShips is now preparing final plans for relocation of <b>ready</b> <b>rooms</b> 2, 3, and 4 to the second deck on the CV 9 class carriers, utilizing the wardroom as number 2. Number 1 should remain in the gallery deck for scrambling purposes CinCPAC ...|$|R
50|$|Also to {{be found}} in <b>ready</b> <b>rooms</b> are pilots' flying gear, {{including}} parachute harnesses, flight jackets, and helmets, ready for the pilots to put on when they leave for their aeroplanes; and assorted maps and to-scale models (of targets and of enemy ships and aircraft).|$|R
5000|$|Admission {{includes}} a self-guided audio tour, narrated by former Midway sailors {{to more than}} 60 locations, including sleeping quarters, engine room, galley, bridge, brig, post office, foc's'le, pilots' <b>ready</b> <b>rooms,</b> officers quarters, primary flight control, and [...] "officers country". Other features include climb-aboard aircraft and cockpits, videos, flight simulators, and a narrated audio tour for youngsters.|$|R
25|$|Many of Bunker Hill's pilots died {{either in}} their planes or inside {{the skin of}} the ship during the attack. 30 fighter pilots of Bunker Hill's air group, CVG-84, were killed in the <b>ready</b> <b>room</b> by the {{explosion}} of the bomb which immediately burned all oxygen in the room and asphyxiated the men.|$|E
500|$|The Constellation-class {{starship}} first {{appears in}} [...] "Encounter at Farpoint" [...] as a desktop model in Picard's <b>ready</b> <b>room.</b> Rick Sternbach constructed the model by kitbashing Ertl kits {{of the movie}} Enterprise, using parts from other models such as the VF-1 Valkyrie to add detail. Greg Jein used Sternbach's and Andrew Probert's designs to create the four-foot shooting model of the USS Stargazer for [...] "The Battle". In the original script, the Stargazer {{was to be a}} redress of the movie-era Constitution-class Enterprise model that first appeared in Probert and Sternbach persuaded the producers not to reuse the movie Enterprise model, and the [...] "Constellation"-class label was chosen so that it could match LeVar Burton's lip movement to redub dialogue.|$|E
500|$|Following {{this initial}} usage, the {{approved}} model was only {{used as a}} stand-in for the production version in the previews in the [...] The drawing of the exterior of Enterprise in the captain's <b>ready</b> <b>room</b> was created by John Eaves in less than 24 hours alongside four other drawings of earlier incarnations of the name. The shuttlecraft on the show were directly inspired by the Lockheed Martin X-33, with Zimmerman saying that the re-entry vehicles used now {{will be the same}} technology used in the time of Enterprise because up until then they won't have had the technological push that comes from developing the advanced technology seen being introduced {{for the first time on}} the show. These were referred to as shuttlepods in the show; Enterprise was equipped with two of them.|$|E
50|$|Two 6 inch Mark XII guns in gun emplacements on {{mountings}} {{were constructed}} at the battery. An underground counter bombardment facility, with gun crew <b>ready</b> <b>rooms,</b> ammunition supply and engine room {{together with a}} narrow-gauge tramway which was cut into the sandstone and lined with sandstone and a large battery observation post were also constructed at the battery.|$|R
50|$|Some airbases in Germany {{were also}} {{equipped}} with firemen's poles to expedite travel from the second-floor <b>ready</b> <b>rooms</b> to their {{aircraft in the}} event of a scramble. The military and law enforcement tactical teams also use a similar sliding descent, known as fast-roping, to quickly descend from helicopters on large-diameter ropes. Gloves must be worn to prevent friction burns.|$|R

500|$|The Enterprise {{interior}} {{sets were}} mostly new designs. The bridge {{was designed to}} be comfortable-looking, with warm colors. Among the new additions was a larger holographic viewscreen that would operate only when activated, leaving a plain wall when disabled. New flatscreen computer monitors were used for displays, using less space and giving the bridge a cleaner look. The new monitors also allowed for video playback that could simulate interaction with the actors. The designers created a larger and less spartan <b>ready</b> <b>room,</b> retaining elements from the television series; Zimmerman added a set of golden three-dimensional Enterprise models to a glass case in the corner. The observation lounge was similar to the design in the Enterprise-D; the set itself was re-used from the television show, the only such set not to be struck following the filming of Generations, though it was expanded and underwent a color change. Engineering was simulated with a large, three-story set, corridors, a lobby, and the largest warp core in the franchise to date. For its Borg-corrupted state, the engineering section was outfitted with Borg drone alcoves, conduits and Data's [...] "assimilation table" [...] where he is interrogated by the Queen. Some existing sets were used to save money; sickbay was a redress of the same location from Voyager, while the USS Defiant scenes used Deep Space Nines standing set. Some set designs took inspiration from the Alien film series, Star Wars and 2001: A Space Odyssey.|$|E
500|$|McCain {{was almost}} killed on board Forrestal on July 29, 1967. [...] While the air wing was {{preparing}} to launch attacks, a Zuni rocket from an F-4 Phantom accidentally fired across the carrier's deck. [...] The rocket struck either McCain's A-4E Skyhawk or one near it. The impact ruptured the Skyhawk's fuel tank, which ignited the fuel and knocked two bombs loose. [...] McCain later said, [...] "I thought my aircraft exploded. Flames were everywhere." [...] McCain escaped from his jet by climbing out of the cockpit, working himself to {{the nose of the}} jet, and jumping off its refueling probe onto the burning deck. His flight suit caught on fire as he rolled through the flames, but he was able to put it out. [...] He went to help another pilot trying to escape the fire when the first bomb exploded; McCain was thrown backwards ten feet (three meters) and suffered minor wounds when struck in the legs and chest by fragments. McCain helped crewmen throw unexploded bombs overboard off the hangar deck elevator, then went to Forrestals <b>ready</b> <b>room</b> and with other pilots watched the ensuing fire and the fire-fighting efforts on the room's closed-circuit television. The fire killed 134sailors, injured scores of others, destroyed at least 20aircraft, and took 24hours to control. [...] In Saigon a day after the conflagration, McCain praised the heroism of enlisted men who gave their lives trying to save the pilots on deck, and told New York Times reporter R. W. Apple, Jr., [...] "It's a difficult thing to say. But now that I've seen what the bombs and the napalm did to the people on our ship, I'm not so sure that I want to drop any more of that stuff on North Vietnam." [...] But such a change of course was unlikely; as McCain added, [...] "I always {{wanted to be in the}} Navy. I was born into it and I never really considered another profession. But I always had trouble with the regimentation." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of November 26, 1943, the Enterprise {{introduced}} the experiment in the co-operative control of Avengers and Hellcats for night fighting, when the three-plane team from the ship broke up {{a large group of}} land-based bombers attacking Task Group TG 50.2. O'Hare volunteered to lead this mission to conduct the first-ever Navy nighttime fighter attack from an aircraft carrier to intercept a large force of enemy torpedo bombers. When the call came to man the fighters, Butch O'Hare was eating. He grabbed up part of his supper in his fist and started running for the <b>ready</b> <b>room.</b> He was dressed in loose marine coveralls. The night fighter unit consisting of 1 VT and 2 VF was catapulted between 17:58 and 18:01. The pilots for this flight were Butch O'Hare and Ensign Warren Andrew [...] "Andy" [...] Skon of VF-2 in F6Fs and the Squadron Commander of VT-6, LCDR John C. Phillips in a TBF1-C. The crew of the TBF torpedo plane consisted of LTJG Hazen B. Rand, a radar specialist and Alvin Kernan, A. B., AOM1/c. The 'Black Panthers', as the night fighters were dubbed, took off before dusk and flew out into the incoming mass of Japanese planes.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the next}} several decades, many {{improvements}} would {{be made to the}} airport, making it a standard of excellence in the general aviation field. A new terminal and administration building was constructed in 1950 consisting of both enclosed and open flight decks, a restaurant, flight <b>ready</b> <b>rooms,</b> classrooms, and operations offices with local, state, and federal funds. Also in the 1950s, Medium Intensity Runway Lights were installed, runways were resealed, and an access road to Glenn Avenue was constructed.|$|R
5000|$|Kenneth Whiting was {{launched}} on 15 December 1943 by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation, Seattle, Washington; sponsored by Mrs. Edna Andresen Whiting, widow of Captain Kenneth Whiting. Kenneth Whiting (Naval Aviator No. 16) received flight training from the Wright brothers at Dayton, Ohio; {{and was the}} first executive officer of the first United States aircraft carrier [...] Commander Whiting was credited with many basic tenets of naval carrier aviation, including landing signal officers, pilot <b>ready</b> <b>rooms,</b> a darkroom and photo lab to develop movies of carrier landings, and making pilot qualification a requirement for command of an aircraft carrier.|$|R
500|$|The {{contract}} for Blackford County's first courthouse was let on December 7, 1841, and construction was supervised by Charles and William F. Jones. [...] The proposed {{cost for the}} courthouse was $5,600. [...] Until the courthouse was <b>ready,</b> <b>rooms</b> were rented from {{various members of the}} community for conducting county government. [...] By May 1845, an arrangement was made for the upper floor to be used for court proceedings until the entire building was completed. [...] Finally, in a special session held October 31, 1845, the board of commissioners found that the courthouse had been completed according to contract. The total cost for the courthouse building was $5,750.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>ready</b> <b>room</b> is a room on an {{aircraft}} carrier where on-duty pilots [...] "stand by" [...] their airplanes. Each flight squadron has its own individual <b>ready</b> <b>room.</b> Large squadrons, such as torpedo and dive-bomber squadrons, can {{have more than one}} <b>ready</b> <b>room.</b> Most ready rooms are located between the flight and hangar decks, but some are located on the flight deck.|$|E

5000|$|Squadron {{pilots in}} the Second World War {{considered}} the <b>ready</b> <b>room</b> to be a clubroom. One personal {{view from a}} World War II pilot stated: The funny thing about a <b>ready</b> <b>room</b> {{is that you get}} attached to the hole. As much as you are attached to the ship. It's more than sentiment. It's an urge for protection. The loneliest feeling in the whole of a carrier pilot's world is when he's at sea with the gas running low, and he can't see his carrier. You think of the <b>ready</b> <b>room</b> then, and the noisy guys who make it the most desirable place in the world. It's your office, you live in it, it is the big thing in your life. &hellip;You sweat and worry in it, and grouse and argue, and you get mad at it when you can't hear yourself speak because everyone is yelling at once, but you're deeply attached to the place.
