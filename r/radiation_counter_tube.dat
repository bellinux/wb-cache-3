For the detection of gamma radiation exposureratemeters manufactured by Bitt Technologies are used. The exposureratemeters consist of a proportional <b>counter</b> <b>tube</b> (type RS 02) and a readout unit (type RM 10 E). The calibration factor (Nk) and the energy response of six <b>counter</b> <b>tubes</b> was determined by the National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection. The calibration factors, expressed as the ratio air kerma to reading, were converted to ambient dose equivalent calibration factors using appropriate conversion factors taken from Grosswend et. al., 1988.

40|$|MIng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Cosmic-ray {{fluctuations}} are {{monitored by}} neutron monitors using several {{different kinds of}} proportional <b>counter</b> <b>tubes.</b> An important component of these monitors is the electronic subsystem that registers and counts output pulses from these <b>counter</b> <b>tubes.</b> Part of the electronic subsystem is a specific preamplifier. The pulse-height distribution curve of the existing preamplifier used in the neutron monitor system at the Centre for Space Research at the North-West University {{was found to be}} incorrect, and therefore the pulse-height information cannot be used for further research on the <b>counter</b> <b>tube</b> characteristics. A correct pulse-height distribution implies that the envelope of the pulse, as generated by an amplifier, has a very specific shape {{as a result of the}} physics that governs the generation of pulses in the neutron <b>counter</b> <b>tube.</b> It was therefore proposed that a new charge-sensitive preamplifier be synthesized to provide an output that provides the correct pulse-height distribution graph for a neutron monitor system. The Centre for Space Research at the North-West University is in the process of designing and building a new mini neutron monitor system. The new charge-sensitive preamplifier will be implemented into this updated system. Ultimately, the electronic subsystem must be able to provide a pulse-height distribution graph at the push of a button, thus making the preamplifier a key component in the new design. In this dissertation the theory of charge-sensitive amplifiers is researched following a design science research methodology. The results showed that a charge-sensitive amplifier can be synthesized to address both the real-world requirements and the theoretical requirements of this research. Master...|$|R
40|$|GM {{counters}} {{are often}} used in radiation detection since they generate a strong signal which can be easily detected. The working principal of a GM counter {{is based on the}} interaction of ionizing radiation with the atoms and molecules of the gas present in the <b>counter's</b> <b>tube.</b> Free electrons created {{as a result of this}} interaction become initial electrons, i. e. start an avalanche process which is detected as a pulse of current. This current pulse is independent of the energy imparted on the gas, that being the main difference between a GM counter and the majority of other radiation detectors. In literature, the dependence on the incidence of radiation energy, tube's orientation and characteristics of the reading system are quoted as the main sources of measurement uncertainty of GM counters. The aim of this paper is to determine the dependence of measurement uncertainty of a GM counter on the volume of its <b>counter's</b> <b>tube.</b> The dependence of the pulse current on the size of the <b>counter's</b> <b>tube</b> has, therefore, been considered here, both in radial and parallel geometry. The initiation and expansion of the current pulse have been examined by means of elementary processes of electrical discharge such as the Markov processes, while the changes in the <b>counter's</b> <b>tube</b> volume were put to test by the space - time enlargement law. The random variable known as the 'current pulse in the counter's tube' (i. e. electrical breakdown of the electrode configuration) has also been taken into account and an appropriate theoretical distribution statistically determined. Thus obtained theoretical results were then compared to corresponding experimental results established in controlled laboratory conditions...|$|R
