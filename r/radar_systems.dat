5|$|Molotov was {{the first}} Soviet ship to carry radar, a Redut-K air warning system, which she used for the entire war. Soviet-designed Mars-1 gunnery <b>radar</b> <b>systems</b> were added by 1944.|$|E
5|$|Another British {{scientist}} {{working on}} <b>radar</b> <b>systems</b> and techniques was R. V.

5|$|During their {{modernization}} {{under the}} 600-ship Navy program, the Iowa-class battleships' <b>radar</b> <b>systems</b> were again upgraded. The AN/SPS-6 air-search radar system {{was replaced with}} the AN/SPS-49 radar set (which also augmented the existing navigation capabilities on the battleships), and the AN/SPS-8 surface-search radar set {{was replaced by the}} AN/SPS-67 search radar.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In any <b>radar</b> <b>system,</b> {{the power}} supply should be stable {{to get an}} {{accurate}} reading on the display screen. When the power supply system does not operate properly, the individual sections of the whole <b>radar</b> <b>system</b> will be damaged. The power supply system in the marine <b>radar</b> <b>system</b> is mainly comprised inverter circuit, regulator circuit with reference oscillator and protector circuit. In this paper, the design analyses of reference oscillator in the regulator circuit and protector circuit in the power supply for the marine <b>radar</b> <b>system</b> with test and results have been presented.

5|$|Numerically {{controlled}} oscillators offer {{several advantages}} over {{other types of}} oscillators in terms of agility, accuracy, stability and reliability. NCOs are used in many communications systems including digital up/down converters used in 3G wireless and software radio systems, digital PLLs, <b>radar</b> <b>systems,</b> drivers for optical or acoustic transmissions, and multilevel FSK/PSK modulators/demodulators.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} search radars installed {{were the}} SK air-search radar and SG surface-search radar during World War II. They were {{located on the}} mainmast and forward fire-control tower of the battleships, respectively. As the war drew to a close, the United States introduced the SK-2 air-search radar and SG surface-search radar; the Iowa class was updated {{to make use of}} these systems between 1945 and 1952. At the same time, the ships' <b>radar</b> <b>systems</b> were augmented with the installation of the SP height finder on the main mast. In 1952, AN/SPS-10 surface-search radar and AN/SPS-6 air-search radar replaced the SK and SG <b>radar</b> <b>systems,</b> respectively. Two years later the SP height finder was replaced by the AN/SPS-8 height finder, which was installed on the main mast of the battleships.|$|E

5|$|Construction at the {{two sites}} started between 1962 and 1963 with {{improvements}} in the TsSO-P test model being fed back into the deployed units. They gained an M-4 2-M computer with semiconductors, although {{the rest of the}} radar used Vacuum tubes. The <b>radar</b> <b>systems</b> were completed in late 1966 with the fourth Dnestr at Balkhash being used for testing. In 1968 the Dnepropetrovsk Sputnik target satellite, DS-P1-Yu, was used to test the ability of the system.|$|E
5|$|One final {{consequence}} of the raid was that the Telecommunications Research Establishment, {{where much of the}} Bruneval equipment was analysed, and British <b>radar</b> <b>systems</b> were designed and tested, was moved further inland from Swanage on the southern coast of England to Malvern to ensure that it was not the target of a reprisal raid by German airborne forces.|$|E
5|$|In hindsight, Callaghan {{was criticized}} for not putting his five ships that had the {{superior}} SG <b>radar</b> <b>systems</b> {{at the ends of}} his column, for not using one of them as his flagship, for directing the battle from his flagship's bridge instead of the radar plot, for not issuing his battle plans to his captains, and for issuing confusing orders during the battle. Analysis of the battle led to a rapid improvement in USN techniques for fighting in poor visibility, particularly in the adoption of combat information centers.|$|E

5|$|Like its sibling V-Bombers, the Victor {{made use}} of the Navigational and Bombing System (NBS); a little-used optical sight had also been {{installed}} upon early aircraft. For navigation and bomb-aiming purposes, the Victor employed numerous <b>radar</b> <b>systems.</b> These included the H2S radar, the first airborne ground-scanning radar, and the Green Satin radar. Radar information was inputted into the onboard electromechanical analogue bomb-aiming apparatus. Some of the navigation and targeting equipment was either directly descended from, or shared concepts with, those used on Handley Page's preceding Halifax bomber. Operationally, {{the accuracy of the}} bomb-aiming system proved to be limited to roughly 400 yards, which was deemed sufficient for high-level nuclear strike operations.|$|E
5|$|Nike Zeus was {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} straightforward development of the earlier Hercules system giving it the ability to hit ICBM warheads at about the same range and altitude as the maximum performance of the Hercules. In theory, hitting a warhead is no more difficult than an aircraft; the interceptor does not have to travel any further or faster, the computers that guide it simply have to select an intercept point farther in front of the target to compensate for the target's much higher speed. In practice, the difficulty is detecting the target early enough that the intercept point is still within range of the missile. This demands much larger and more powerful <b>radar</b> <b>systems,</b> and faster computers.|$|E
5|$|Storm {{spotters}} {{are needed}} because <b>radar</b> <b>systems</b> such as NEXRAD do not detect a tornado; merely signatures which {{hint at the}} presence of tornadoes. Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or imminent tornado, but ground truth from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out.|$|E
50|$|The RBE2-AA <b>radar</b> <b>system</b> is {{an active}} {{electronically}} scanned array (AESA) <b>radar</b> <b>system</b> derived from the Rafale's RBE2 radar. It replaces the mechanically steered array antenna by electronically steering exerted by up to several thousand of transmit-receive modules which enable maximum performance and versatility as well as enhanced reliability. The improved RBE2-AA <b>radar</b> <b>system</b> is available since 2012 for the Rafale fighter-aircraft owned by the French Air Force, Navy and export customers.In April 2002, the French weaponry procurement agency (DGA) awarded Thales a contract to develop an {{active electronically scanned array}} (AESA) radar demonstrator based on the RBE2 <b>radar</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R

5|$|The British and Germans {{had been}} {{competing}} in radar technology {{for nearly a}} decade at this point, with the German technology often at the same level as the British or surpassing them due to heavy investment in the fledgling technology. By the beginning of World War II, Britain had devised effective <b>radar</b> <b>systems,</b> primarily through the work of Robert Watson-Watt, although much of the technology was still rudimentary in nature and Watson-Watt and other scientists had failed to devise an effective night-defence system in time for the German nighttime bombing of Britain during 1940.|$|E
5|$|The Mk. IV {{was used}} in the front lines for only a short period. The {{introduction}} of the cavity magnetron in 1940 led to rapid progress in microwave-frequency radars, which offered far greater accuracy and were effective at low altitudes. The prototype Mk. VII began to replace the Mk. IV at the end of 1941, and the AI Mk. VIII largely relegated the Mk. IV to second-line duties by 1943. The Mk. IV's receiver, originally a television receiver, was used as the basis of the ASV Mk. II radar, Chain Home Low, AMES Type 7, and many other <b>radar</b> <b>systems</b> throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|The Pye strip {{was such}} an advance on the EMI unit that the EF50 became a key {{strategic}} component. As a German invasion of the west loomed in 1940, the British contacted Philips and arranged a plan to remove the company's board of directors to the UK, along with 25,000 more EF50s and another 250,000 bases, onto which Mullard, Philip's UK subsidiary, could build complete tubes. A destroyer, , was dispatched {{to pick them up}} in May, and left the Netherlands only days before the German invasion on 15 May 1940. The Pye strip, and its 45MHz intermediate frequency, would be re-used in many other wartime <b>radar</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|E

It has been shown that the value of the CFAR loss for a high-resolution <b>radar</b> <b>system</b> can vary considerably over a radar detection range, dependent on the clutter scenario and the CFAR detection processing used and, therefore, can not be given by a single number for the whole detection area, as it is usually done for a low-resolution <b>radar</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

5|$|The Spitfire {{continued}} to play increasingly diverse roles throughout the Second World War and beyond, often in air forces other than the RAF. For example, the Spitfire became the first high-speed photo-reconnaissance aircraft to be operated by the RAF. Sometimes unarmed, they flew at high, medium and low altitudes, often ranging far into enemy territory to closely observe the Axis powers and provide an almost continual flow of valuable intelligence information throughout the war. In 1941 and 1942, PRU Spitfires provided the first photographs of the Freya and Würzburg <b>radar</b> <b>systems</b> and, in 1943, helped confirm that the Germans were building the V1 and V2 Vergeltungswaffe ("vengeance weapons") by photographing Peenemünde, on the Baltic Sea coast of Germany.|$|E
5|$|The Wild Weasels {{also carried}} {{electronic}} countermeasures (ECM) equipment to protect themselves. They directed flak suppression strikes and carried AGM-45 Shrike anti-radiation missiles (another Navy development), which homed {{in on the}} <b>radar</b> <b>systems</b> of the SAMs. The SA-2 had greater range than the Shrike, but if the Shrike was launched and the radar operator stayed on the air, the American missile would home in on the signal and destroy the radar source. A sophisticated cat and mouse game then ensued between North Vietnamese radar operators and the Wild Weasel pilots.|$|E
5|$|The reentry {{phenomenology}} was {{of interest}} {{both to the}} Army, as it might allow long-range decluttering to be carried out, and to the Air Force, whose own ICBMs might be at risk of long-range interception if the Soviets exploited a similar concept. A program to test these concepts was {{a major part of}} ARPA's Project Defender, especially Project PRESS, which started in 1960. This led to the construction of high-power <b>radar</b> <b>systems</b> on Roi-Namur, the northernmost point of the Kwajalein atoll.
