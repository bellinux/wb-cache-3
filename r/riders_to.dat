5|$|An {{important}} race {{in its own}} right, the 2015 Tour de Suisse {{was used}} by some Tour de France <b>riders</b> <b>to</b> perfect their physical conditions, as the well-known French race started on 4 July. The route for the race was announced on 9 March 2015.|$|E
50|$|With his {{relatively}} late start, Dowd {{has achieved}} {{the best results}} of his career later in life than his typical competitors. He holds many AMA records including oldest <b>rider</b> <b>to</b> win an AMA National (Southwick 125cc, 1998), oldest <b>rider</b> <b>to</b> win a Supercross championship (125cc West, 1998), oldest <b>rider</b> <b>to</b> win a National moto (Mt.

50|$|Centering is {{a process}} also done in T'ai chi ch'uan that helps the <b>rider</b> <b>to</b> find their center of balance. This allows the <b>rider</b> <b>to</b> remain {{centered}} {{no matter how the}} horse moves underneath them.|$|R
50|$|Shivers has twenty-two career BFTS wins. He has {{recorded}} the following history-making firsts: the first PBR bull <b>rider</b> <b>to</b> win more than $300,000 {{in prize money}} in one year (1998); the first PBR bull <b>rider</b> <b>to</b> reach the $1 million mark (2001), the $2 million mark (2003) and the $3 million mark (2006); the first PBR bull <b>rider</b> <b>to</b> register 13 90-point rides in one season (1998); the highest marked ride in PBR history (96.5 points - twice); and the first bull <b>rider</b> <b>to</b> win three consecutive Bud Light Cup events (2000).

5|$|At {{the time}} of Men in Black: Alien Attacks development, Universal Creative were {{installing}} two new dark ride systems at the neighbouring Islands of Adventure theme park. The first system was designed for The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man and was manufactured by Oceaneering International. It featured track-mounted motion bases with {{six degrees of freedom}} that were able to tour physical sets and allow <b>riders</b> <b>to</b> view 3D projections. The second system was developed by MTS Systems Corporation for The Cat in the Hat. This system was simpler, offering track-mounted spinning platforms, with no additional degrees of freedom. The MIB design team initially intended to utilise the Spider-Man ride system; however, when shooting tests were performed on the ride, the vast motion of the vehicles made it impossible for <b>riders</b> <b>to</b> achieve a reasonable score. As a result, The Cat in the Hat system was selected for the MIB attraction.|$|E
5|$|In 1903 Synge left Paris {{and moved}} to London. He had written two one-act plays, <b>Riders</b> <b>to</b> the Sea and The Shadow of the Glen, the {{previous}} year. These met with Lady Gregory's approval and The Shadow of the Glen was performed at the Molesworth Hall in October 1903. <b>Riders</b> <b>to</b> the Sea was performed at the same venue in February the following year. The Shadow of the Glen, under the title In the Shadow of the Glen, formed part of the bill for the opening run of the Abbey Theatre from 27 December 1904 to 3 January 1905. Both plays were based on stories that Synge had collected in the Aran Islands, and Synge relied on props from the Aran Islands to help {{set the stage for}} each of them. He also relied on Hiberno-English, the English dialect of Ireland, to reinforce its usefulness as a literary language, partly because he believed that the Irish language could not survive.|$|E
5|$|The 17 UCI World Tour {{teams were}} {{automatically}} entitled and obliged {{to start the}} race; three UCI Professional Continental teams were invited as wildcards to form a twenty-team peloton. Each team entered eight <b>riders</b> <b>to</b> form a 160-rider peloton; one rider, 's Daniel Oss, withdrew before the race due to a fall in training, so 159 riders started the race.|$|E
50|$|In 2014 Phillips {{became the}} first British male <b>rider</b> <b>to</b> win the UCI BMX Supercross World Cup, {{becoming}} the first <b>rider</b> <b>to</b> win two back-to-back BMX World Cup titles {{when he took a}} second series win in 2015.|$|R

5000|$|Sofuoglu is {{currently}} the most successful <b>rider</b> <b>to</b> have ever competed in the Supersport World Championship. Now a five-time champion, he was previously the only <b>rider</b> <b>to</b> have won three times, and he holds most of the career and track records in the class.|$|R
5|$|The 2013 {{season was}} {{arguably the best}} season of Durant's career. He set career highs in touchdowns, with 31, while {{limiting}} his interceptions to only 12. He began the year having attempted 212 consecutive pass attempts without being intercepted joining Dave Dickenson and later Ricky Ray as the only quarterback in CFL history to start 7 consecutive games without throwing an interception. He also set a career-high for passer rating with 95.7 (excluding his 2006 season in which he only completed one pass). He led the <b>Riders</b> <b>to</b> an 11-7 record and home-field in the Western Semi-Finals against the BC Lions where several of his rushing plays won the game for the Riders. After beating Calgary in the Western Final, Durant led the <b>Riders</b> <b>to</b> their fourth Grey Cup championship on their home turf at Mosaic Stadium.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{there was}} a sprints classification, the leader of which was awarded a white jersey. In the sprints classification, riders {{received}} points for finishing {{in the top three}} at intermediate sprint points during each stage. There was also a mountains classification, the leadership of which was marked by a red jersey. Points for this classification were won by the first <b>riders</b> <b>to</b> the top of each categorised climb, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs.|$|E
5|$|At low forward speeds, the {{precession}} of {{the front}} wheel is too quick, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to oversteer, start to lean {{the other way and}} eventually oscillate and fall over. At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to understeer and eventually fall over without ever having reached the upright position. This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is easy for most <b>riders</b> <b>to</b> counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled.|$|E

On May 9, 2005, Adams left the Peoria Rough <b>Riders</b> <b>to</b> attend training camp with the Saskatchewan Roughriders. He {{acted as a}} backup for the Roughriders throughout the 2005 season. In July, he started in place of Nate Davis, who was unable to play due to back spasms. Adams went on to play in only five regular season games, where he made two sacks and four tackles.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, CART {{became the}} 39th public {{transportation}} {{system in the}} United States to be featured on Google Transit, a website that allows transportation users to electronically plan their travel routes. In 2010, CART buses were modified to include a GPS tracking system that allows <b>riders</b> <b>to</b> see the location of buses and their predicted arrival times via the CART and Google websites. CART buses transport more than 1.3million travelers annually.|$|E
5|$|In the station, {{the trains}} are {{oriented}} in a vertical position {{in order to}} allow <b>riders</b> <b>to</b> board. Once the restraints are locked, the train seats are rotated forward 90 degrees into a horizontal position and the train is then dispatched from the station. When the train returns to the station, the seats rotate back down and the riders disembark for the next guests.|$|E

5|$|Justice League: Alien Invasion 3D (also {{known as}} Justice League 3D – The Ride) is an Interactive Dark Ride {{created by the}} Sally Corporation that is located at Warner Bros. Movie World on the Gold Coast, Australia. It opened on 22 September 2012 and {{requires}} <b>riders</b> <b>to</b> shoot their laser blasters at targets in order to defeat an alien threat. The ride is touted as the world's first Justice League-themed ride and the first ride of its type to feature 3D projections. Justice League: Alien Invasion 3D has been well received with many praising the ride's special effects and immersive theming.|$|E
5|$|Next to {{the older}} and much steeper stairs leading to the Aracoeli, Michelangelo devised a monumental wide-ramped stair (the cordonata), {{gradually}} ascending the hill to reach the high piazza, so that the Campidoglio resolutely turned its back on the Roman Forum that it had once commanded. It was built to be wide enough for horse <b>riders</b> <b>to</b> ascend the hill without dismounting. The railings are topped by the statues of two Egyptian lions in black basalt at their base and the marble renditions of Castor and Pollux at their top.|$|E
5|$|Seattle Transit {{general manager}} Lloyd Garber said that demand for parking {{was higher than}} {{expected}} {{and that it was}} too early to analyze ridership; after the first week of service, Seattle Transit began surveying <b>riders</b> <b>to</b> determine whether motorists had been lured by the new service. The study determined that 75 percent of surveyed patrons had switched from their personal automobiles, and that Blue Streak was responsible for a decrease of 400 vehicles on Interstate 5 at rush hour. By late October, demand at the Northgate park and ride prompted the State Highway Department to offer funding for an auxiliary lot.|$|E

5|$|Since the 1980s, Southeast D.C. {{has been}} synonymous with crime and violence, and {{has one of}} the highest crime rates in the District of Columbia (albeit not the highest rates in all {{categories}} of crimes). Concern about crime at the Anacostia, Congress Heights, and Southern Avenue stations has existed for many years, although statistics only partially support these concerns. Fear of crime was one of the reasons why, in 1991, Prince George's County residents fought bus route changes that would have forced <b>riders</b> <b>to</b> disembark at Anacostia Station.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 Giro d'Italia {{began on}} 9 May, with Stage 11 {{occurring}} on 20 May. The first stage, {{like it had}} been since 2007, was a team time trial, a stage where each member of the team raced together against the clock. Like most cycling Grand Tours do, the beginning of the 2009 Giro included a string of flat stages that were contested by sprinters. These stages were contested by Alessandro Petacchi and Mark Cavendish, among others, with Petacchi in victory becoming one of the only <b>riders</b> <b>to</b> defeat Cavendish in a sprint in the 2009 season.|$|E
5|$|The fourth- and second-to-last <b>riders</b> <b>to</b> {{leave the}} starthouse, Levi Leipheimer and Denis Menchov, {{put up the}} best rides of the day, with Menchov between 30 seconds and a minute better than Leipheimer at the three {{intermediate}} time checks, and 20 seconds better at the line for the stage win. Menchov's ride propelled him into the pink jersey, while Leipheimer narrowly missed taking enough time out of Di Luca to move past him in the general classification. Di Luca finished sixth on the stage.|$|E
