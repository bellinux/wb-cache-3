5|$|Universal {{precautions}} {{within the}} health care environment {{are believed to be}} effective in decreasing the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>HIV.</b> Intravenous drug use is an important risk factor and harm reduction strategies such as needle-exchange programs and opioid substitution therapy appear effective in decreasing this risk.|$|E
5|$|Commercial {{sex workers}} (including those in pornography) have an {{increased}} rate of HIV. Rough sex can be a factor {{associated with an increased}} risk of transmission. Sexual assault is also believed to carry an increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> transmission as condoms are rarely worn, physical trauma to the vagina or rectum is likely, and there may be a greater risk of concurrent sexually transmitted infections.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{condom use}} reduces the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> {{transmission}} by approximately 80% {{over the long}} term. When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year. There is some {{evidence to suggest that}} female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection. Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women. By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.|$|E

5|$|Many {{different}} {{sources of information}} can motivate discussion about HIV/AIDS among married couples.

In addition, women are more likely than men to mention the dangers of HIV/AIDS when they suspect that their spouses are engaging in extramarital sexual relations. According to a 2003 study by Eliya Msiyaphazi Zulu and Gloria Chepngeno, although higher levels of education do correspond to greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS, education levels do not significantly impact the likelihood that couples will discuss HIV-related prevention strategies.|$|E
5|$|Measures {{to prevent}} {{opportunistic}} infections {{are effective in}} many people with HIV/AIDS. In addition to improving current disease, treatment with antiretrovirals {{reduces the risk of}} developing additional opportunistic infections. Adults and adolescents who are living with HIV (even on anti-retroviral therapy) with no evidence of active tuberculosis in settings with high tuberculosis burden should receive isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), the tuberculin skin test can be used to help decide if IPT is needed. Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for all people at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> before they become infected; however it may also be given after infection. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis between four and six weeks of age and ceasing breastfeeding in infants born to HIV positive mothers is recommended in resource limited settings. It is also recommended to prevent PCP when a person's CD4 count is below 200cells/uL and in those who have or have previously had PCP. People with substantial immunosuppression are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and MAC. Appropriate preventive measures have reduced the rate of these infections by 50% between 1992 and 1997. Influenza vaccination and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are often recommended in people with HIV/AIDS with some evidence of benefit.|$|E

40|$|<b>Risk</b> <b>of</b> {{professional}} {{transmission of}} hepatitis B is known since the seventies. Recently the possibility <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> transmission during surgical practice was demonstrated. It {{was interesting to}} assess Belgian surgeons and anesthetists opinion about this risk and about the precautions taken. An opinion survey was performed with {{a representative sample of}} Belgian surgeons and orthopedists (340) as well as anesthetists (100). <b>Risks</b> <b>of</b> transmission <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> and possible elementary precautions are not well known. The rate of vaccination against hepatitis B is low, specially in smaller hospitals. However the frequency of injuries during practice is high in surgeons as well as in anesthetists. This study shows that important information efforts about the <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> infection and the possible precautions to be taken are still necessary. Information about the need for vaccination against hepatitis B should also be done, considering the high incidence of operative injuries.

25|$|There are {{a variety}} of factors that make {{male-to-female}} anal intercourse riskier for a female than for a male. For example, besides the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> transmission being higher for anal intercourse than for vaginal intercourse, the risk of injury to the woman during anal intercourse is significantly higher than the risk of injury to her during vaginal intercourse because of the durability of the vaginal tissues compared to the anal tissues. Additionally, if a man moves from anal intercourse immediately to vaginal intercourse without a condom or without changing it, infections can arise in the vagina (or urinary tract) due to bacteria present within the anus; these infections can also result from switching between vaginal sex and anal sex by the use of fingers or sex toys.|$|E
500|$|With {{regard to}} {{unprotected}} heterosexual contacts, {{estimates of the}} <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> transmission per sexual act appear to be four to ten times higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries. In low-income countries, the risk of female-to-male transmission is estimated as 0.38% per act, and of male-to-female transmission as 0.30% per act; the equivalent estimates for high-income countries are 0.04% per act for female-to-male transmission, and 0.08% per act for male-to-female transmission. The risk of transmission from anal intercourse is especially high, estimated as 1.41.7% per act in both heterosexual and homosexual contacts. While the risk of transmission from oral sex is relatively low, it is still present. The risk from receiving oral sex {{has been described as}} [...] "nearly nil"; however, a few cases have been reported. The per-act risk is estimated at 00.04% for receptive oral intercourse. In settings involving prostitution in low income countries, risk of female-to-male transmission has been estimated as 2.4% per act and male-to-female transmission as 0.05% per act.|$|E
500|$|Evidence {{supports}} that male circumcision reduces the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> infection among heterosexual men in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, the WHO recommends considering circumcision {{as part of}} a comprehensive HIV prevention program in areas with high rates of HIV such as sub-Saharan Africa. Evidence for a health benefit against HIV for {{men who have sex with}} men is less clear. Likewise, the effectiveness of using circumcision to prevent HIV in the developed world is also unclear. Circumcision is associated with reduced rates of cancer causing forms of human papillomavirus (HPV), UTIs, and cancer of the penis. Prevention of those conditions is not a justification for routine circumcision of infants. Studies of its potential protective effects against other sexually transmitted infections have been unclear. A 2010 review found circumcisions performed by medical providers to have a typical complication rate of 1.5% for babies and 6% for older children, with few cases of severe complications. Bleeding, infection, and the removal of either too much or too little foreskin are the most common complications cited. Complication rates are higher when the procedure is performed by an inexperienced operator, in unsterile conditions, or in older children. Circumcision [...] does not appear to have a negative impact on sexual function.|$|E
