500|$|Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict looked unfavorably on the episode, {{writing that}} it [...] "has a premise—Bart builds a soapbox racer—that frankly has very limited modern day appeal. We can't <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the whole Martin/Nelson/Bart race dynamic and today, soapbox derby has been technologized {{all out of}} {{proportion}} to the point where very few, if any, practice it. With such a narrow target, many of the jokes just don't work." [...] Gibron preferred the subplot of Homer's attempts to become a better father.|$|E
500|$|Later, CBS {{approached}} [...] writer Peter M. Lenkov {{to pitch}} a reimagined pilot of the show, as Lenkov {{himself was a}} fan of the original. When executive producers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman known about the remake, the two were originally hesitant to participate, but were impressed by Lenkov's pitch, since the story had [...] "such a great kind of paradigm for the show and how to <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the characters that he really talked us into it." [...] All three developed the story of the pilot, though Lenkov was the one who wrote the script. On February 19, 2010, CBS ordered the production of the pilot, with Len Wiseman chosen to direct. It was the first time Wiseman worked on a television program, and it was also the first time he used digital cinematography rather than film.|$|E
500|$|Lisa Mahapatra from The New Indian Express was {{impressed}} with the story and Tripathi's writing and praised [...] "the interactions between Shiva and Sati, [...] intriguing. Age-old thoughts and philosophies were delivered in a very modern context, which I thought made for an interesting juxtaposition." [...] Mahapatra added that [...] "the only downside throughout the novel, I was unable to <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the main characters—they remained mostly on a two-dimensional level." [...] It received a mixed review from Hindustan Times, where the reviewer was critical of Tripathi's usage of common, everyday language. [...] "There are many other subtle depictions of Lord Ram and other characters and overall its very well written. I wrote to Amish to express one small observation, the script writing is not that sharp. You have words like 'Goddamnit', 'bloody hell', 'In the name of God what is this nonsense?' etc, which I guess would be great for an Indian audience but after you just finish a Steven Erikson novel you find it falling a little flat," [...] the reviewer concluded.|$|E

500|$|Scottish actor Kevin McKidd, who {{had never}} {{appeared}} in a television series that necessitated over twelve months of filming, was cast as Lucius Vorenus, one of the lead characters. McKidd said, [...] "What was different about this show is you get 14 months to <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> {{every nook and cranny}} of the character, in a way you don't get a chance to explore when you do a movie or a theater play. Initially, it was a terrifying prospect. But once you got over that, you realize what a great opportunity it was." [...] Heller described his character as [...] "very much a Roman of the Old School, a stoic man devoted to duty and religion and the legion." [...] Ray Stevenson played Titus Pullo, a soldier who befriends Vorenus. McKidd said that [...] "they're kind of thrown together by fate, by chance, but somewhere along the line they start to stick... keep finding themselves accidentally at the epicenter of tumultuous events and immense change, so they're kind of clinging to each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. Ology (website)'s Josh Harrison gave it an {{eight out of}} ten rating, writing that [...] "You gotta love these Simpsons episodes that <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> {{the heart of a}} subculture. Diving head-first into the world of foodies and food blogging (after a hilarious geeky pit-stop at a video game expo), 'The Food Wife' shish-kabobs gourmet diehards while highlighting a very real problem between Homer and Marge." [...] He concluded that the episode is [...] "a definite swing for the fences, and I think it hits its mark completely." [...] The scenes at the video game convention were praised by Anthony Severino of Game Revolution as well. He commented that the writers [...] "nailed it. Everything from the massive displays, long lines, and even the look of the Los Angeles Convention Center was spot on. The best was how they portrayed people with 'VIP passes', you know those things that we journalists get, as douches who think they're better than the regulars." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{material}} also {{marked a}} certain honing of Plant's vocal approach, and signalled his {{emergence as a}} serious songwriter. Plant's name had previously been absent from the songwriting credits of the band's first album due to the previous contractual commitments that resulted from his earlier association with CBS Records as a solo artist. His influence on tracks such as [...] "What Is and What Should Never Be" [...] and [...] "Ramble On" [...] were pointers to the band's musical future. Plant has commented {{that it was only}} during the sessions for Led Zeppelin II that he started to feel at home as a vocalist in the studio with Led Zeppelin. In a 2008 interview for Uncut, he stated [...] "uring Led Zep I (1969) as far as I was concerned, I thought that I was going to [...] anyway. I didn't feel that comfortable because {{there were a lot of}} demands on me vocally—which there were all the way through the Zeppelin thing.

500|$|The episode {{features}} cultural {{references to}} many American and British films. Woods becoming {{a convenience store}} clerk {{to prepare for a}} film is similar to Nick Lang (Michael J. Fox) becoming a police officer in the 1991 film The Hard Way, which Woods also starred in (interestingly, this is a reversal of roles: Woods played the cop that Lang was saddled with in the film). When Kent asks Homer if he is willing to go undercover to [...] "nail" [...] Apu, Homer replies: [...] "No way, man, get yourself another patsy!" [...] This is a reference to a line in the 1991 film JFK. The scene of Homer and Apu riding on mules to the Springfield Airport, with their luggage strapped to the mules' backs, is similar to a scene from the 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia. In his Kwik-E-Mart job interview, the interviewer asks Woods why he would want to work at the Kwik-E-Mart, to which he replies: [...] "To be honest, in my upcoming movie I'm going to be playing this tightly-wound convenience store clerk and, I kind of like to research my roles and <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> it. For instance, in True Believer I actually worked in a law firm for two months. And then, the film Chaplin I had a little cameo in that. I actually traveled back in time, back to the twenties, where... Well, I've said too much," [...] referencing the 1989 film True Believer and the 1992 film Chaplin.|$|E

[...] And that's the truth: It's {{very hard not to}} look at Alan Rickman [...] and Jason Isaacs [...] and not get erotic thoughts. I have some fan fiction at Fiction Alley.

2500|$|The set for The Colbert Report {{was called}} [...] "The Eagle's Nest" [...] and {{reflects}} and facilitates Colbert's self-aggrandizing style. It {{was designed by}} Jim Fenhagen, and was intended to both capture the character's ego and be [...] "hyper-American." [...] Elements incorporated into the set included architectural lines converged to Colbert's desk, and radial beams coming out from behind his chair. Colbert's main influence for the set was Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper, with the Colbert character as Jesus Christ. In the set, [...] "virtually every inch emblazoned with Colbert's name or the initial C"; his name, initials {{and the name of}} the show appear on the desk's plasma screen, on the rafters above the desk, and the desk itself is shaped like a giant [...] "C". The background includes faux artifacts from the character's backstory, which are seldom seen by viewers. [...] "I kept saying, 'People might not really notice this.' But when you're working with a comedy team, they <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> it. They couldn't help themselves," [...] said Fenhagen. Among these touches are the United States Constitution, a miniature Ten Commandments, and a CliffNotes guide to American government.|$|E

60|$|This, {{as nearly}} as I can set it down, {{is what he}} told us: That the French fellows picked up {{baseball}} {{in a way that}} is absolutely amazing; they were not much good, it seems, at the bat, at any rate not at first, but at running bases they were perfect marvels; some of the French made good pitchers, too; Tom knew a poilu who had lost his right arm who could pitch as good a ball with his left as any man on the American side; at the port where Tom first landed and where they trained for a month they had a dandy ball ground, a regular peach, a former parade ground of the French barracks. On being asked WHICH port it was, Tom said he couldn't remember; he thought it was either Boulogne or Bordeaux or Brest,--at any rate, it was one of those places on the English channel. The ball ground they had behind the trenches was not so good; it was too much cut up by long range shells. But the ball ground at the base hospital (where Tom was sent for his second wound) was an A1 ground. The French doctors, it appears, were perfectly rotten at baseball, not a bit like the soldiers. Tom wonders that they kept them. Tom says that baseball had been tried among the German prisoners, but they are perfect dubs. He doubts whether the Germans will ever be able to play ball. They lack the national spirit. On the other hand, Tom thinks that the English will play a great game when they <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> it. He had two weeks' leave in London and went to see the game that King George was at, and says that the King, if they will let him, will make the greatest rooter of the whole bunch.|$|E
60|$|But, if it {{were all}} true, L'Estrange (and a writer who made the {{assertion}} in 1681) collected {{a good deal of}} evidence* to show that a rumour of Godfrey's disappearance, and probable murder by bloody Papists, was current in London on the afternoon of the day when he disappeared, Saturday, October 12.*** Mr. Pollock says that the evidence is 'not to be relied on,' and part of it, attributing the rumour to Godfrey's brothers, is absurd. THEY were afraid that Godfrey had killed himself, not that he was murdered by Papists. That 'his household could not have known that he would not return,' is not to the point. The people who raised the rumour were not of Godfrey's household. Nor is it to the point, exactly, that, being invited to dine on Saturday by Mr. Welden, who saw him on Friday night, 'he said he could not tell whether he should.'** For Wynell had expected to dine with him at Welden's to talk over some private business about house property.*** Wynell (the authority for Godfrey's being 'master of a dangerous secret') did expect to meet Godfrey at dinner, and, knowing the fears to which Godfrey often confessed, might himself have originated, by his fussy inquiries, the rumour that Sir Edmund was missing. The wild excitement of the town might add 'murdered by Papists,' and the rumour might <b>really</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> a letter from London of Saturday night, reaching Tixall by Monday morning. North says: 'It was in every one's mouth, WHERE IS GODFREY? HE HAS NOT BEEN AT HIS HOUSE ALL THIS DAY, THEY SAY HE IS MURDERED BY THE PAPISTS.'**** That such a pheemee^ might arise is very conceivable. In all probability the report which Bishop Burnet and Dr. Lloyd heard of the discovery of Godfrey's body, before it was discovered, was another rumour, based on a lucky conjecture. It is said that the report of the fall of Khartoum was current in Cairo {{on the day of the}} unhappy event. Rumour is correct once in a myriad times, and, in October 1678, London was humming with rumours. THIS report might get into a letter to Tixall, and, if so, Dugdale's early knowledge is accounted for; if knowledge he had, which I have shown to be disputable.|$|E
