2500|$|Under MS-DOS, Btrieve up to version 5, was a Terminate-and-Stay-Resident {{program which}} functioned as an {{application}} programming interface (API) [...] database engine, supplying applications programs with function calls to implement a multi-user database with <b>record</b> <b>locking.</b> The network version worked in a similar way.|$|E
2500|$|Jet allows {{multiple}} {{users to}} access the database concurrently. To prevent that data from being corrupted or invalidated when multiple users try to edit the same record or page of the database, Jet employs a locking policy. Any single user can modify only those database records (that is, items in the database) to which the user has applied a lock, which gives exclusive access to the record until the lock is released. In Jet versions before version 4, a page locking model is used, and in Jet 4, a <b>record</b> <b>locking</b> model is employed. Microsoft databases are organized into data [...] "pages", which are fixed-length (2kB before Jet 4, 4kB in Jet 4) data structures. Data is stored in [...] "records" [...] of variable length that may take up less or more than one page. The page locking model works by locking the pages, instead of individual records, which though less resource-intensive also means that when a user locks one record, all other records {{on the same page}} are collaterally locked. [...] As a result, no other user can access the collaterally locked records, even though no user is accessing them and {{there is no need for}} them to be locked. [...] In Jet 4, the <b>record</b> <b>locking</b> model eliminates collateral locks, so that every record that is not in use is available.|$|E
50|$|<b>Record</b> <b>locking</b> is the {{technique}} of preventing simultaneous access to data in a database, to prevent inconsistent results.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first known}} hit single {{to have a}} <b>recorded</b> <b>locked</b> groove is [...] "Muskrat Love" [...] by Captain & Tennille. A few years later, in December 1975, a British artist known as Chris Hill did a {{break-in}} record (see Dickie Goodman or Bill Buchanan) called, [...] "Renta Santa" [...] on Philips 6006-491 that included a <b>recorded</b> <b>locked</b> groove {{at the end of}} the side.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{example of}} <b>recorded</b> <b>locked</b> groove <b>record</b> is Godspeed You! Black Emperor's debut album F#A#∞ (pronounced F-sharp, A-sharp, Infinity). At {{the end of}} the song [...] "Bleak, Uncertain, Beautiful ..." [...] there is a string phrase <b>recorded</b> on the <b>locked</b> groove. The title's [...] "infinity" [...] refers to this phrase. The Stereolab album Transient Random Noise Bursts With Announcements ends with the song [...] "Lock Groove Lullaby" [...] which, as the name suggests, extends into the locked groove. Nail by Scraping Foetus Off The Wheel (1985) {{features}} a <b>recorded</b> <b>lock</b> groove on the final song ("Anything") which results in the final note of the album slowly repeating itself. Portugal. The Man's 2008 album Censored Colors contains a locked groove at {{the end of the}} first disc repeating the words [...] "turn me over." [...] The second side of the live King Crimson album, USA has a locked groove that contains the first few seconds of applause after they finish playing [...] "21st Century Schizoid Man." [...] The first Kissing the Pink album, Naked, features a <b>recorded</b> <b>locked</b> groove at the end of side one which continuously plays the last note of [...] "The Last Film." [...] The Otto Von Schirach album Pukology is pressed on two 7-inch colored discs (one yellow, one transparent brown), all four sides end in <b>recorded</b> <b>locked</b> grooves. One side ends with repeated burping, one side ends with repeated toilet flushing, one side ends with what sounds like tape/record scratching, and one side ends with repeated vomiting.|$|R
25|$|File settings: this {{category}} contains settings related to files, file handles, <b>record</b> <b>locks,</b> indexes, and log files. The number of open files and logical file handles {{was set in}} here, {{as well as the}} number of <b>record</b> <b>locks</b> per client; index balancing and an option to create files in pre 6.x format are in {{this category}}. It also controlled whether the Microkernel kept a log of operations executed on selected files. In this section the method of file sharing could be set to either MEFS or SEFS. The system transaction hold limit sets the number of system transactions performed during write operations for shared files.|$|R
50|$|Records that {{absolutely}} must {{be managed by}} a <b>record</b> <b>locking</b> process are those which are processor shared. In TPF, most record accesses are done by using record type and ordinal. So if you had defined a record type in the TPF system of 'FRED' and gave it 100 records or ordinals, then in a processor shared scheme, record type 'FRED' ordinal '5' would resolve to exactly the same file address on DASD — clearly necessitating {{the use of a}} <b>record</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Database servers, {{that provide}} access to a shared {{database}} via a database device driver, are not regarded as file servers as they may require <b>Record</b> <b>locking.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Record</b> <b>locks</b> need to {{be managed}} between the {{entities}} requesting the records such that no entity is given too much service via successive grants, and no other entity is effectively locked out. The entities that request a lock can be either individual applications (programs) or an entire processor.|$|R
5000|$|Mainframe {{computers}} used {{a monolithic}} architecture with considerable success. Monolithic architectures implemented on DOS and earlier Windows based PCs often worked poorly with multiple users [...] This performance degradation is mainly due to poor mechanisms for <b>record</b> <b>locking</b> and file handling across local area networks.|$|E
50|$|Sharing of VSAM data between CICS regions {{can be done}} by VSAM Record-Level Sharing (RLS). This adds record caching and, more importantly, <b>record</b> <b>locking.</b> Logging {{and commit}} {{processing}} remain the responsibility of CICS which means that sharing of VSAM data outside a CICS environment is severely restricted.|$|E
50|$|Starting {{with the}} second {{versions}} of the Professional Write, Professional File and Professional Plan trio, a separately-purchased Professional series networking add-on (available in 5-user, 10-user and larger packs) could be obtained {{so that they could}} all function in a multi-user local area networking (LAN) environment utilizing rudimentary file locking (but not <b>record</b> <b>locking)</b> via NetBIOS on such as Novell's NetWare, or Banyan VINES.|$|E
5000|$|The Gorillaz debut album, {{like the}} CD release, {{features}} the remix of [...] "Clint Eastwood" [...] {{as a bonus}} track but the LP has a <b>recorded</b> <b>locked</b> groove after what {{is meant to be}} the final track of the album so the needle has to be physically lifted and moved to play the bonus track.|$|R
50|$|In a {{database}} management system, for example, a lock could protect, {{in order of}} increasing granularity, part of a field, a field, a record, a data page, or an entire table. Coarse granularity, such as using table locks, tends to give the best performance for a single user, whereas fine granularity, such as <b>record</b> <b>locks,</b> tends to give the best performance for multiple users.|$|R
50|$|Michael's {{playback}} is {{cut short}} by Hal, but having witnessed a digital near-death experience makes Michael curious to see the entire tape. Alex has the <b>recording</b> <b>locked</b> away and tells Michael {{he will not be}} allowed to view it. When he returns to work, Michael walks in on Landon Marks and a team of outsider technicians going through his research records and protests to Alex who responds by firing Michael and Karen.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{serialize}} accesses between data records on a loosely coupled system, a practice known as <b>record</b> <b>locking</b> must be used. This {{means that when}} one mainframe processor obtains a hold on a record, the mechanism must prevent all other processors from obtaining the same hold and communicate to the requesting processors that they are waiting. Within any tightly coupled system, this is easy to manage between I-streams via {{the use of the}} Record Hold Table. However, when the lock is obtained offboard of the TPF processor in the DASD control unit, an external process must be used. Historically, the <b>record</b> <b>locking</b> was accomplished in the DASD control unit via an RPQ known as LLF (Limited Locking Facility) and later ELLF (extended). LLF and ELLF were both replaced by the Multipathing Lock Facility (MPLF). To run, clustered (loosely coupled) z/TPF requires either MPLF in all disk control units or an alternative locking device called a Coupling Facility.|$|E
50|$|Most {{operating}} systems support {{the concept of}} <b>record</b> <b>locking,</b> which means that individual records within any given file may be locked, thereby {{increasing the number of}} concurrent update processes. Database maintenance uses file locking, whereby it can serialize access to the entire physical file underlying a database. Although this does prevent any other process from accessing the file, it can be more efficient than individually locking a large number of regions in the file by removing the overhead of acquiring and releasing each lock.|$|E
50|$|MBASIC in the uncustomized form had no {{functions}} for graphics, color, joysticks, mice, serial communications, networking, sound, {{or even a}} real-time clock function. MBASIC did not fully support {{the features of the}} host CP/M operating system, for example, it did not support CP/M's user areas for organizing files on a diskette. Since CP/M systems were typically single-user and stand alone, there was no provision for file or <b>record</b> <b>locking,</b> or any form of multitasking. Apart from these limitations, MBASIC was considered at the time to be a powerful and useful implementation of BASIC.|$|E

In 2011, the group released Symphony Soldier, their first album with Johnson and new bassist in the band Joey Thunder. The album was also released independently. It wasn't until 2014 that the band released another <b>record,</b> <b>Lock</b> Me Up.|$|R
5000|$|Where to use optimistic locking: this is {{appropriate}} in environments {{where there is}} low contention for data, or where read-only access to data is required. Optimistic concurrency is used extensively in [...]NET {{to address the needs}} of mobile and disconnected applications, where locking data rows for prolonged periods of time would be infeasible. Also, maintaining <b>record</b> <b>locks</b> requires a persistent connection to the database server, which is not possible in disconnected applications.|$|R

50|$|Wang dialects of COBOL-74 and COBOL-85 have {{important}} {{places in the}} evolution of COBOL. Wang was among the first, if not the first, to integrate COBOL into environments built from the ground up to be interactive as well as batch. Wang also had a principal role in the COBOL standards bodies until the early 1990s. Wang extensions to COBOL involving <b>record</b> <b>locking</b> scope, rollback and rollforward recovery implemented at the file system level allowing transaction processing, and full interactive workstation screen I/O have often made it difficult to port Wang COBOL applications to other systems.|$|E

50|$|In 1987, Concurrent DOS {{was rewritten}} to become Concurrent DOS 386. This ran on {{machines}} {{equipped with the}} Intel 80386 and later processors, using the 386's hardware facilities for virtualizing the hardware, allowing most DOS applications to run unmodified under Concurrent DOS 386, even on terminals. The OS supported concurrent multiuser file access, allowing multiuser applications to run {{as if they were}} on individual PCs attached to a network server. Concurrent DOS 386 allowed a single server to support a number of users on dumb terminals or inexpensive low-specification PCs running terminal emulation software, without the need for expensive workstations and then-expensive network cards. It was a true multiuser system; several users could use a single database with <b>record</b> <b>locking</b> to prevent mutual interference.|$|E

5000|$|Data General {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{minicomputer}} firms from the late 1960s. Three of the four founders were former employees of Digital Equipment Corporation. Their first product, the Data General Nova, was a 16-bit minicomputer. This used their own operating system, Data General RDOS (DG/RDOS), and in conjunction with programming languages like [...] "Data General Business Basic" [...] they provided a multi-user operating system with <b>record</b> <b>locking</b> and built-in databases far ahead of many contemporary systems. The Nova was followed by the Supernova and Eclipse product lines, all of which were used in many applications for the next two decades. The company employed an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) sales strategy to sell to third parties who incorporated Data General computers into the OEM's specific product lines. A series of missteps in the 1980s, including missing the advance of microcomputers despite the launch of the microNOVA in 1977, and the Data General-One portable computer in 1984, led to a decline in the company's market share. The company did continue into the 1990s, however, and was eventually acquired by EMC Corporation in 2002.|$|E
5000|$|Originally on the Microdata implementation, and {{subsequently}} implemented on all Pick systems, a BASIC language called Data/BASIC with numerous syntax extensions for smart terminal interface and database operations {{was the primary}} programming language for applications. A PROC procedure language was provided for executing scripts. A SQL-style language called ENGLISH allowed database retrieval and reporting, but not updates (although later, the ENGLISH command [...] "REFORMAT" [...] allowed updates on a batch basis). ENGLISH did not fully allow manipulating the 3-dimensional multivalued structure of data records. Nor did it directly provide common relational capabilities such as joins. This was because powerful data dictionary redefinitions for a field allowed joins via the execution of a calculated lookup in another file. The system included a spooler. A simple text editor for file-system records was provided, but the editor was only suitable for system maintenance, and could not lock records, so most applications were written with the other tools such as Batch, RPL, or the BASIC language so as to ensure data validation and allow <b>record</b> <b>locking.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{present a}} {{cost-effective}} method for improving data availability during restart recovery of a data base management system (DBMS) after a failure. The method achieves its objective by enabling {{the processing of}} new transactions to be-gin even before restart recovery is completed by exploiting the Comnlt-rs~V concept. It supports fine-granularity (e. g., <b>record)</b> <b>locking</b> with semantically-rich lock modes and operation logging, partial roll-backs, write-ahead logging, and the steal and no-force buffer management policies. The over-head imposed by this method during normal trans-action processing is insignificant. We require very few changes to an existing DBMS in order to sup-port our method. Our method can be implemented with different degrees of sophistication depending on the existing features of a DBMS. 1...|$|E
