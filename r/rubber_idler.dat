50|$|Earlier designs used a {{rubberized}} idler-wheel drive system. However, {{wear and}} decomposition of the wheel, {{as well as}} the direct mechanical coupling to a vibrating motor, introduced low-frequency noise ("rumble") and speed variations ("wow and flutter") into the sound. These systems generally used a synchronous motor which ran at a speed synchronized to the frequency of the AC power supply. Portable record players typically used an inexpensive shaded-pole motor. At the end of the motor shaft there was a stepped driving capstan; to obtain different speeds, the <b>rubber</b> <b>idler</b> wheel was moved to contact different steps of this capstan. The idler was pinched against the bottom or inside edge of the platter to drive it.|$|E
