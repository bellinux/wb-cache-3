We present results from two studies: a cross-sectional survey of 155 North American Doctoral Students, and {{a longitudinal study}} of 286 working adults. The findings from both studies extend previous research by demonstrating that high levels of perceived organizational support and leader member exchange significantly reduce facades <b>of</b> <b>conformity.</b> A positive relationship between facades <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> and emotional exhaustion was observed, but results {{for the relationship between}} facades <b>of</b> <b>conformity</b> and work engagement were inconsistent.
