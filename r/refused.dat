The study also showed that <b>Refuse</b> workers suffered from different types of diseases and symptoms, such as sore throat, cough, and high temperature (55. 3 %), diarrhea or bloody stool (27. 9 %), shortness of breath (25 %), and skin disease (20. 2 %). <b>Refuse</b> workers were prone to different injuries, such as hit by any hard or sharp objects (61. 1 %), lift more than their capacity (37. 4 %), and fall while pulling or pushing the <b>Refuse</b> trolley (35. 6 %). The study also showed that <b>Refuse</b> workers whom were stuck with hard object (21. 6 %), pricked by hypodermic needles (20. 2 %), twisted ankle while on duty (34. 1 %), and suffered from a muscle tear (22. 1 %). It showed that (93. 8 %) of <b>Refuse</b> workers were not vaccinated for tetanus and (85. 6 %) were not vaccinated for hepatitis. In conclusion, <b>Refuse</b> workers face a tremendous health challenges. <b>Refuse</b> workers with middle age and with low level of education were at higher risk. <b>Refuse</b> workers should be provided with the necessary protective measures (face mask, protective gloves, overall, and rubber boot). Education and training programs should be provided to all, and routine medical checkup program should be implemented and maintained, to keep them safe and secure...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMessor barbarus (LINNAEUS, 1767) ants are Mediterranean region seed predators. However, transported seeds can {{be found}} {{rejected}} in <b>refuse</b> piles around their nests, making this ant a seed dispersal agent. This raises the following quesdons: Do <b>refuse</b> piles affect seed distribution? Do their small-scale seed composition, richness, and density in autumn and winter {{differ from those of}} areas without <b>refuse</b> piles? Are there differences in the vegetation found the following spring in <b>refuse</b> piles that have survived the winter or on sites where they have been destroyed, compared with control areas without <b>refuse</b> piles? In a Mediterranean steppe, we measured autumn and winter seed banks in a greenhouse, both in <b>refuse</b> piles and in controls. The following spring, in situ seedlings from <b>refuse</b> piles, from <b>refuse</b> piles artificially destroyed (sieved) in winter, and from controls without <b>refuse</b> piles were recorded. Seedling species richness and density were significantly higher in autumn in <b>refuse</b> piles than in controls. Nevertheless, no increased seedling contribution from the transient seed bank was detected in the winter <b>refuse</b> piles. The following spring, natural persistent <b>refuse</b> piles showed no seedlings. However, seedling species richness and density were significantly higher in places where <b>refuse</b> piles had been sieved before in winter. The construction of <b>refuse</b> piles by M. barbarus locally concentrates seed density and seed species richness; for the first time, a positive impact on seedlings is observed in places where <b>refuse</b> piles were sieved before winter and the potential bias of this methodology must be now compared with actions of natural agents (surface runoff) that destroyed <b>refuse</b> piles in winter...|$|R

40|$|Production of non-methane organic {{compounds}} during <b>refuse</b> decomposition in a laboratory-scale landfill The presence of non-methane {{organic compounds}} (NMOCs) in landfill gas is well documented. However, {{there is little}} understanding {{of the degree to}} which the production of NMOCs should be attributed to the volatilization of household hazardous waste as opposed to intermediates of the anaerobic decomposition of the major cellulosic components of municipal solid waste. The objectives of this study were: (1) to compare the NMOC yields for decomposed <b>refuse,</b> fresh residential <b>refuse,</b> and a synthetic refuse; and (2) to evaluate the source of NMOCs emitted during <b>refuse</b> decomposition. Replicate 2 - 1 reactors were filled with shredded residential <b>refuse</b> expected to contain household hazardous waste, synthetic <b>refuse</b> containing no hazardous constituents, and control reactors with decomposed <b>refuse</b> only. Anaerobic decomposition of each <b>refuse</b> was initiated with a seed of decomposed <b>refuse,</b> and the reported methane and NMOC yields were corrected for that attributable to the seed. The NMOC yields from the seed, synthetic <b>refuse,</b> and residential <b>refuse</b> were comparable (0. 62 to 1. 01 X 10 - 4 g NMOC (dry g) - 1, suggesting that the volatilization of hazardous organic compounds is not the sole source of NMOCs in landfill gas and that anaerobic biodegradation intermediates also contribute to NMOCs...|$|R
