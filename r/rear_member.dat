50|$|The 15th {{or early}} 16th-century curule seat that survives at York Minster, {{originally}} entirely covered with textiles, has <b>rear</b> <b>members</b> extended upwards {{to form a}} back, between which a rich textile was stretched. The cross-framed armchair, no longer actually a folding chair, continued to have regal connotations. James I of England was portrayed with such a chair, its framing entirely covered with a richly patterned silk damask textile, with decorative nailing, in Paul van Somer's portrait. Similar early 17th-century cross-framed seats survive at Knole, perquisites from a royal event.|$|R
50|$|The Midget was {{powered by}} an {{air-cooled}} 32 hp (24 kW) Bristol Cherub on a steel tube mounting and cowled with its cylinders protruding. Each mainwheel {{of the conventional}} undercarriage was located on a V-form pair of struts joined to the lower longeron {{at the base of}} the lift struts, the <b>rear</b> <b>member</b> passing through the lower wing. The two wheels and bungee shock absorbers were mounted on a single axle with an inverted V-strut from its ends to the fuselage central girder. All the undercarriage struts, like the wing struts, were of steel with balsa fairings. There was a small tailskid.|$|E
50|$|The same sloping <b>rear</b> <b>member</b> of the N-strut {{was used}} to join the nacelle to the open rear fuselage. Two pairs of V-shaped steel tube struts were {{attached}} to it at the wing trailing edge and at its foot; the first was horizontal, the other upward sloping, and their rear meeting points were used to support the fabric covered empennage. These points were also wire braced from the wing underside. The tailplane, fitted {{between the end of}} the horizontal V, had straight edges and constant chord, with rectangular elevators. There was a central triangular fin and rectangular rudder, both extending above and below the tailplane; the rudder worked in a cut-out between the elevators.|$|E
50|$|The {{extremely}} simple {{wing of the}} BS.7 {{was built}} around two spars, one close to the leading edge and the other near mid-chord. The upper ends of the bracing struts were attached to {{the underside of the}} spars at about 40% span and to the upper fuselage, at a position directly beneath the forward spar. There was only one bracing wire on each side, running {{from the top of the}} forward wing strut to the centre of the upper fuselage just aft of the trailing edge. The fabric covered wing was rectangular in plan apart from the aileron tips, which were obliquely cropped. It was mounted above the fuselage on a trapezoidal frame formed from three struts in a distorted, inverted N shaped arrangement, the <b>rear</b> <b>member</b> sloping shallowly aft.|$|E

40|$|The {{defensive}} {{behaviors of}} four opisthobranchs (Glossodoris cincta, Risbecia imperials, Stylochelius striatus, and Dolabrifera dolabrifera) were observed and categorized. The displays studied were mantle flexation, mucus production, mantle secretion, inking, and <b>rearing.</b> <b>Members</b> of each species {{were placed in}} two laboratory situations containing two different antagonists. The antagonists (Dardanus lagopodes and Lutjanus fulvus) were chosen because they were carnivorous, abundant, and found in the same ecology as the opisthobranchs studied. Additionally, they were chosen because they differed phylogenetically, physiologically, and behaviorally and, therefore, represented two very different predators. In some cases, individuals exhibited different defensive behaviors {{in the presence of}} different antagonists. Differential responses could reflect physiological, biological, or phylogenetic differences between the four observed opisthobranch species. In some instances, defensive displays were observed across lineages...|$|R

5000|$|Like {{all these}} designs, the BS.11 was a simple, high wing aircraft. Its {{rectangular}} plan, two spar, fabric covered wings were supported over the nacelle on a single, central, distorted N form strut, with an upright forward member and a sloping rear component. These met the wing at the spars, the forward one {{almost at the}} leading edge. The <b>rear</b> <b>member</b> of the N extended above the wing to meet a short, near vertical strut, forming a flat, fabric covered, triangular pylon or cabane, from which a pair of landing wires ran to both spars on each side. Flying wires from a point on the lower fuselage directly beneath {{the tip of the}} cabane ran to the same positions on the wing underside. As on all of these low aspect ratio Zögling style wings, the ailerons were short span and broad, with cropped tips forming the wing tips ...|$|E
50|$|A {{modified}} front suspension setup received {{lower control}} arm pivot points. The Series II update featured {{the addition of a}} new <b>rear</b> cross <b>member,</b> revised <b>rear</b> control arm assemblies with new style bushing and toe-control links to the semi-trailing arm rear suspension to better maintain the toe settings during suspension movements, resulting in more predictable car handling, noticeably over uneven surfaces, and improved tyre wear.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s Francis Welham and Arthur Levell {{conceived}} a new single spar duralumin wing structure that promised weight savings without loss of strength. It {{was quite different}} from the already established Monospar design. [...] The wing was built around a cross braced, girder-like box, with the front and <b>rear</b> <b>members</b> attached to it with cantilever ribs. [...] With financial support from S.W. Cole of EKCO radio, they set up a company known by their initials as CLW Aviation, based at Gravesend, Kent and built a wing for testing. [...] This performed to the calculations even under destructive testing, and the company decided to produce a small aeroplane using it. The CLW Curlew was intended both as a demonstrator and as a trainer for those pilots going on to modern, fast monoplanes. It was also seen as a contender in the open two-seater market, particularly for the richer buyer after a machine with [...] "snappier" [...] performance. [...] It made its first flight on 3 September 1936 at Gravesend, flown by the ex-Beardmore pilot A.N. Kingwill.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{investigated}} farm {{information systems}} use among grasscutter farmers in Ga-South and Awutu-Senya District in Ghana. Using frequency, cross tabulations and binary logit model in Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 18, the study made some findings. Grasscutter {{farmers in the}} study area are ageing. They operate on small scale with males dominating the enterprise. The generally literate farmers used production records mostly. Farmers’ use of farm information systems did not show positive association with obtaining credit from formal credit institutions. The use of books and loose sheets to keep records of farm operations is most popular with the farmers. Use of computers is least popular. Too much work, no reasons for non-use, and inadequate time at their disposal to spare some for recording were some of the reasons adduced for not using farm information systems. Age, level of education, farm size, and farmer status, membership of association, sex, experience and income were found to be independent of farm information systems use. Government and non-governmental organisations must encourage young persons especially females to engage in the enterprise. An investigation into the causes of low farm size will unearth the causes and as such provide ways to increase farm size as most of the farmers are into full time grasscutter <b>rearing.</b> <b>Members</b> of grasscutter farmers association need to step up their membership drive to recruit more farmers into the association as associations are better to relate to and reach with extension effort...|$|R
50|$|However the insuperable {{problem was}} the {{proximity}} of the engine to the rear axle, and on 33 ft versions many different designs of drive-shaft were employed but no effective way was found of insulating the engine and gearbox from road shocks. Crosville had all of its 36 ft models converted with a revised engine and gearbox mounting closer to the <b>rear</b> cross <b>member,</b> allowing a longer universal-jointed drive shaft to be put in place, this arrangement was also applied to later long-wheelbase RU as built. To cover for vehicles being modified, Seddon Atkinson lent Crosville the prototype Pennine 7 (UBU72N), which remained with Crosville after the work was done.|$|R
500|$|The Human Centipede {{contains}} {{relatively few}} gory images; {{little of the}} surgical procedure is depicted directly, no excrement is shown on screen, and according to Kim Newman in Empire, it is [...] "never quite as outrageous as it threatens to be." [...] Six stated that he wanted the film to be as authentic as possible and claimed to have consulted a Dutch surgeon during the creation and filming process, resulting in the film being [...] "100% medically accurate." [...] Six said that the surgeon initially {{wanted nothing to do}} with his film, as he felt Six was [...] "crazy" [...] and the idea had [...] "nothing to do with medical science." [...] However, the surgeon changed his mind and decided that he in fact liked the idea, and so came up with a method of creating a human centipede. Six has claimed that the central and <b>rear</b> <b>members</b> of the centipede could survive for years by supplementing their diet with an IV drip. The special effects team was led by a father and son team, Rob Hillenbrink and son Erik. They designed the final composition of the centipede from sketches provided by the consulting surgeon. The actors who made up the centipede wore hardened underwear, compared by Yennie to shorts, which had a rubber grip for the actors to wear for the actor behind on which to bite, creating the illusion of the mouth-to-anus connection. Six kept secret how the centipede would be formed as long as possible, and Yennie claimed that even her make-up artist did not know, asking Yennie what kind of [...] "suit" [...] the actors would be wearing.|$|R
5000|$|The Triavion's {{fuselage}} was rectangular in cross-section, flat sided and bottomed but {{topped with}} a triangular section decking through which the wings passed. The forward wing was braced to the lower fuselage longerons with two pairs of parallel lift struts on each side, one pair to the neutral lift inner section {{and the other to}} the outer panels. These pairs had horizontal and vertical jury struts between them. A pair of N-form struts angled outwards from the upper longerons to form a cabane supporting the centre section of the wing. The shorter rear wing needed only a single parallel pair on each side from the lower fuselage with similar upper longeron N-struts. Its [...] six cylinder, radial Anzani engine was mounted in the nose. The forward cockpit was just under a V-shaped cut-out in the centre section trailing edge and the second was midway between the two wings; both were within the triangular decking, which had large openings in it, and there were also round apertures in the sides to improve downward vision. Both cockpits were accessed via starboard-side doors. The empennage was conventional, with a large, upright fin and a vertical edged unbalanced rudder that went down to the keel; the cantilever tailplane and elevators were rectangular in plan, with rounded corners and a cut-out for rudder movement, and were mounted a little lower than the wings on the upper fuselage longerons. It had conventional landing gear with mainwheels on a single axle rubber sprung to V-struts from the lower fuselage, their <b>rear</b> <b>members</b> part of a transverse inverted W-form strut also joined to the central fuselage.

It might be obvious that flight-related neck pain should be prevented whenever possible. The main objective of this thesis was to study neck pain in military aircrew especially of the Royal Netherlands Air Force and, in doing so, to generate knowledge about the extent of the problem, to identify associated factors concerning the aircrew’s capacity and work situation, and to learn about aircrew’s experiences to find and test feasible preventive measures. A renewed protocol to optimise aircrew’s helmet fit was tested and evaluated on the experienced neck load and neck pain during night flights.

40|$|Abstract. As {{the core}} of {{automotive}} welding production line, the development speed and quality of automotive welding jig impact on the automobile production cycle and manufacturing precision directly. At present, the traditional design method of automotive welding jig is difficult {{to adapt to the}} developing speed of auto body. In order to improve the design efficiency of the welding jig, a rapid automobile welding jig design method based on parametric technology is developed in this paper. Supported by parametric theory, combining with CATIA secondary development approach, the principle and structure of the automobile welding jig rapid design system are presented, and related key technologies in rapid design system developing are studied deeply, and a rapid welding jig parametric design system is developed finally.
