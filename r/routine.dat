5|$|<b>Routine</b> {{home care}} {{is the most}} common level of care provided. In spite of its title, <b>routine</b> home care does not {{indicate}} a location of care, but a level (or intensity) of care provided. <b>Routine</b> care may be provided at a nursing home or assisted living facility, although the majority of hospice patients are treated at home.

Twenty-four-hour on-call services must be available as needed. Typically this is provided after normal business hours by a registered nurse prepared to address urgent patient concerns.|$|E

50|$|Developing an {{argument}} {{on the basis}} of the above contention that <b>routines</b> are recurrent interaction patterns, literature characterizes <b>routines</b> as repetitive by virtue of recurrence, persistent, leading to predictability, interaction patterns having a collective nature, interplay of collective patterns constituting a whole out of different <b>routines</b> parts. In other words, <b>routines</b> in organisations constitute collective action that integrates distributed action elements. <b>Routines</b> are also self-actuating and they do not need voluntary deliberation and owing to this characteristic, problems are removed from the conscious influence and cognitive resources are freed up for deliberative action when dealt with <b>routines.</b> Moreover, <b>routines</b> are processual phenomenon, they are context dependent, specific and they can only be transferred to a limited level. In this regard, successful <b>routines</b> application depends on the context specificities where there exist complementarities between <b>routines</b> and context.|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{organizational}} <b>routines</b> {{was introduced to}} help understand organizational behavior and organizational change (Nelson & Winter, 1982; March & Simon, 1958; Cyert & March, 1963). Previous studies that have applied organizational <b>routines</b> as analytical perspective to understand these issues, however, have shown the task is not trivial. Many seem sceptical of the contribution an analysis employing organizational <b>routines</b> can make. While {{much has been written}} on organizational <b>routines,</b> empirical research employing organizational <b>routines</b> as analytical perspective is still at a relatively early stage. Accordingly, methodological questions still create stumbling blocks in applying the concept of organizational <b>routines.</b> We are convinced such problems are directly responsible for the limited analytical potential of organizational <b>routines</b> that has been realized so far. The objective {{of this article is to}} advance and strengthen organizational <b>routines</b> as analytical perspective for understanding organizational behavior and organizational change. In order to do so, the article tackles two questions: (1) How to apply organizational <b>routines</b> as analytical perspective so they make a contribution to understanding organizational behavior? (2) What is the contribution that organizational <b>routines</b> as analytical perspective can make to explaining organizational behavior and organizational change? We develop answers to these two questions by applying organizational <b>routines</b> as analytical perspective in analyzing the product development process at an engineering center...|$|R

Moreover, innovative <b>routines</b> are contingent on the institutional context of engineering consultancy business and, in particular, on the effects of widespread use of information and communication technologies...|$|R
