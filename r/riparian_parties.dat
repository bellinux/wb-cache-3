40|$|A novel {{bankruptcy}} {{approach is}} proposed for resolving transboundary river conflicts {{in which the}} total water demand or claim of the <b>riparian</b> <b>parties</b> {{is more than the}} available water. Bankruptcy solution methods can allocate the available water to the conflicting parties with respect to their claims. Four commonly used bankruptcy methods in the economic literature are used here to develop new river bankruptcy solution methods for allocating water to the <b>riparian</b> <b>parties</b> of river systems. Given the non-uniform spatial and temporal distribution of water across river basins, the proposed solution methods are formulated as non-linear network flow optimization models to allocate water with respect to time sensitivity of water deliveries at different locations in a river network during the planning horizon. Once allocation optimization solutions are developed, their acceptability and stability must be evaluated. Thus, a new bankruptcy allocation stability index (BASI) is developed for evaluating the acceptability of river bankruptcy solutions. To show how the proposed river bankruptcy framework can be helpful in practice, the suggested methods are applied to a real-world transboundary river system with eight riparians under various hydrologic regimes. Stability analysis based on the proposed stability evaluation method suggests that the acceptability of allocation rules is sensitive to hydrologic conditions and demand values. This finding has an important policy implication suggesting that fixed allocation rules and treaties may not be reliable for securing cooperation over transboundary water resources as they are vulnerable to changing socioeconomic and climatic conditions as well as hydrologic non-stationarity...|$|E
40|$|Next {{to issues}} of land, water {{resources}} are the major bone of contention in the peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Per-capita annual renewable freshwater resources {{in the region are}} among the lowest in the world. This paper will attempt to identify an appropriate framework for management of shared aquifers underlying Israel and West Bank that comprise hydrological, legal, institutional, and socio-economic and environmental issues. The article calls for the application of international water law in the resolution of water disputes in the negotiating process. The challenging task for negotiators is to translate water law principles into operating rules and procedures for the equitable apportionment of waters from shared water resources. The paper introduces a multi-criteria decision tool as a possible approach to the problem of allocating the waters of the Mountain Aquifer between all <b>riparian</b> <b>parties.</b> A general mathematical model was derived in which the proportional entitlements of the Mountain Aquifer were determined. The model yields the following results (40 %, 60 %) where 40 % represents the Israeli and 60 % the Palestinian entitlement...|$|E
40|$|Shared water {{resources}} are strong sources {{of conflict in}} the Jordan River basin shared by Israel, Jordan, Palestine, Syria and Lebanon. The control and allocation of water has been explicitly made {{a part of the}} ongoing peace negotiations. This article calls for the application of international water law in the resolution of water disputes in the negotiating process. The challenging task for negotiators is to translate water law principles into operating rules and procedures for the equitable apportionment of waters from shared {{water resources}}. The negotiators need a decision tool based upon objective criteria or standards to reach equitable entitlements to shared water resources by all parties. This paper introduces a multi-criteria decision tool as a possible approach to the problem of allocating the waters of the Jordan River between all <b>riparian</b> <b>parties.</b> The prime principle of the criteria is equitable allocation factors identified by water law. A general mathematical model was derived in which the proportional entitlements of the Jordan River basin waters were determined to the five riparians. It is hoped that, water negotiators review this approac...|$|E
40|$|The Jordan River system, {{which is}} shared by Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Jordan and Palestine, is {{a major issue in}} the current Middle East peace negotiations. Although we believe that the International Water Law is the most {{suitable}} basis to solve the disputes between Arab countries and Israel, it is worthwhile developing multi weighting approximation criteria for determining the water rights for the above riparian countries. The paper provides an overview of current resolution principles and procedures and presents the conflict resolution process in theory. The aim {{of this paper is to}} develop multi-criteria decision tool to the problem of allocating the waters of the Jordan River Basin between all <b>riparian</b> <b>parties.</b> The prime principle of the criteria is equitable and reasonable allocation factors identified by the International Law Commission in its draft articles on the non navigational uses of water. A general mathematical model was derived that found the optimal allocation outcome based on the weight of each factor. The approach presented here should be seen as a trial to deal with the Palestinian-Israeli conflict over water rights in such complex trans-boundary water resources system. It is hoped that, water negotiators review this approach...|$|E
40|$|Ongoing {{discussions on}} water-energy-food nexus {{generally}} lack {{a historical perspective}} and more rigorous institutional analysis. Scrutinizing a relatively mature benefit sharing approach {{in the context of}} transboundary water management, the study shows how such analysis can be implemented to facilitate understanding in an environment of high institutional and resource complexity. Similar to system perspective within nexus, benefit sharing is viewed as a positive sum approach capable of facilitating cooperation among <b>riparian</b> <b>parties</b> by shifting the focus from the quantities of water to benefits derivable from its use and allocation. While shared benefits from use and allocation are logical corollary of the most fundamental principles of international water law, there are still many controversies as to the conditions under which benefit sharing could serve best as an approach. Recently, the approach has been receiving wider attention in the literature and is increasingly applied in various basins to enhance negotiations. However, relatively little {{attention has been paid to}} the costs associated with benefit sharing, particularly in the long run. The study provides a number of concerns that have been likely overlooked in the literature and examines the approach in the case of the Ferghana Valley shared by Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan utilizing data for the period from 1917 to 2013. Institutional analysis traces back the origins of property rights of the transboundary infrastructure, shows cooperative activities and fierce negotiations on various governance levels. The research discusses implications of the findings for the nexus debate and unveils at least four types of costs associated with benefit sharing: (1) Costs related to equity of sharing (horizontal and vertical); (2) Costs to the environment; (3) Transaction costs and risks of losing water control; and (4) Costs as a result of likely misuse of issue linkages...|$|E
