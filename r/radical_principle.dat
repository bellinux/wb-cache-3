It little becomes us to speak contemptuously of the religion of races to whom we stand in such relations; nor do I think any man of modesty or thoughtfulness will ever speak so of any religion, in which God has allowed one good man to die, trusting.|$|E

No modern thinker before Nietzsche has {{gone as far as}} Spinoza in shedding all historical religion and all horizons of transcendence. In wondering what had enabled Spinoza to tear himself so drastically from the Western theistic tradition, Yovel did not turn directly to the rational arguments that drove Spinoza, but looked first for the historico-existential situation that cleared the mental space for those arguments to emerge and take hold in the mind.|$|E

Since its emergence, it has been widely used to explain a variety of emergent phenomena in the fields of natural science, social science, management science and some other science and technology fields. Firstly, this paper introduces the theory of catastrophe in several aspects, such as its generation, <b>radical</b> <b>principle,</b> basic characteristics and development. Secondly, it summarizes the main applications of catastrophe theory in the field of mechanical engineering, focusing on the research progress of catastrophe theory in revealing catastrophe of rotor vibration state, analyzing friction and wear failure, predicting metal fracture, and so on. Finally, it advises that later development of catastrophe theory should {{pay more attention to the}} combination of itself with other traditional nonlinear theories and methods.

Considering that machine rotor parameters in real experiment system will change as the circulation state of machine, while the asynchronous machine mold in MATLAB simulation software electric system tool box can’t timely change its parameters in circulation, the writer composed the machine model that can simulate rotor parameters timely change by making use of the S-function in MATLAB by himself. On the basis of that, establish a simulation system for the whole asynchronous machine vector control, and firstly simulate and analyze the system under conditions of ignoring and considering rotor parameters. Simulation results show, the rotor parameters change caused by skin effect in reality makes the dynamic performance of asynchronous machine vector control become worse...|$|E

40|$|The {{idea of a}} precautionary {{principle}} (or {{precautionary principle}}s) is beginning {{to come to the}} wider attention of the environmental community, governmental agencies, regulatory agencies, and the regulated community. Different precautionary principles have not been specified in detail, and, of course, this is difficult to do. Yet some specification must be done in order to understand it better and, {{if it is to be}} used for specific action-guidance, to implement it. Moreover, it is important to understand more about the principle, its background assumptions and its comparison with other principles to which we might subscribe. This paper explores aspects of the PP and its background assumptions and presuppositions, comparing them with those for risk assessment and other statements of the PP. It also briefly indicates how it resembles legal principles in addressing problems of uncertainty. Finally, it recapitulates two possible versions of the PP and suggests an application of it for an emerging threat to the environment and public health. This review suggests the PP has plausible applications and is not the <b>radical</b> <b>principle</b> some have suggested...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to offer a {{complete}} description of the dec 1 ension of the substantives in the Grigorovich's prophetologium (Grig), a Macedonian church Slavonic literary work from the end ofthe 12 th or {{the beginning of the}} 13 th Century, and {{on the basis of this}} description to establish the system relations among the various paradigms and herewith discover the development tendencies which are expresse'd in the dec 1 ension of the substantives of this literary work in the context of the church Slavonic literature of that time. It was accomplished a full exception of the substantives from the Old Testamental reading of the Grig. - For the correct understanding of the phonetic structure of the suffixes was made in the first part of the thesis an orthographical and phonetic analysis of the language of the Grig.

It investigates everyday life as a key terrain of political engagement, interrogating the everyday spatial strategies of two emerging forms of radical politics. The community dimension of the research focuses on two London-based social centre collectives, understood as community-based, anarchist-run political spaces. The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), an international trade union that organises along <b>radical</b> left-libertarian <b>principles,</b> comprises the workplace element. The empirical research was conducted primarily through an activist-ethnographic methodology. Based in a politically-engaged framework, the research opens up debates surrounding the role of place-based class politics in a globalised world, and how such efforts can contribute {{to our understanding of}} social relations, place, networks, and political mobilisation and transformation. The research thus contributes to and provides new perspectives on understanding and enacting everyday spatial strategies. Utilising Marxist and anarchist thought, the research develops a distinctive theoretical framework that draws inspiration from both perspectives. Through an emphasis on how groups seek to implement particular <b>radical</b> <b>principles,</b> the research also explores the complex interactions between theory and practice in radical politics. I argue that it is in everyday spaces and practices where we find the most powerful sources for political transformation. Grassroots politics are most 3 effective when enacted through everyday place-based relations. Prefigurative spatial strategies enacted by the groups studied not only strive to create relations fit for a post-capitalist society, but also seek to mobilise and articulate their politics in ways that are tailored to the specific context of struggle.

2500|$|In the mid-1850s Pisemsky {{was widely}} praised {{as one of}} the leading authors of the time, {{alongside}} Ivan Turgenev, Ivan Goncharov and Fyodor Dostoyevsky who as late as 1864, in one of his letters, referred to [...] "the colossal name that is Pisemsky." [...] Then came his dramatic fall from grace, for which there were several reasons. One was that, as Skabichevsky noted, Pisemsky had never repudiated his 'troglodyte' mindset of a 'provincial obscurantist'; exotic in the early 1850s, it became scandalous {{at the end of the}} decade. Another had to do with the fact that people he regarded as [...] "crooks, whores and demagogues" [...] had suddenly reinvented themselves as the [...] "progressives". Gradually Biblioteka Dlya Chtenya, the journal he was now leading, came into a direct opposition with Sovremennik. First, as Pyotr Boborykin remembered, this opposition was of a moderate character, [...] "at home, in his cabinet, Pisemsky spoke about this with sorrow and regret, rather than aggression". Later biographers conceded that there had been some logic to his chagrin. [...] "People who came to herald such <b>radical</b> <b>principles,</b> in his eyes, should have been impeccable in every respect, which wasn't the case," [...] Skabichevsky remarked.|$|R
60|$|He {{comes before}} {{the people of}} the United States at a {{remarkable}} era {{in the history of this}} country and of the world. The two great parties of the nation appear--at least to an observer somewhat removed from both--to have nearly merged into one another; for they preserve the attitude of political antagonism rather through the effect of their old organizations than because any great and <b>radical</b> <b>principles</b> are at present in dispute between them. The measures advocated by the one party, and resisted by the other, through a long series of years, have now ceased to be the pivots on which the election turns. The prominent statesmen, so long identified with those measures, will henceforth relinquish their controlling influence over public affairs. Both parties, it may likewise be said, are united in one common purpose,--that of preserving our sacred Union, as the immovable basis from which the destinies, not of America alone, but of mankind at large, may be carried upward and consummated. And thus men stand together, in unwonted quiet and harmony, awaiting the new movement in advance which all these tokens indicate.|$|R
60|$|The {{rights of}} men--that is to say, the natural rights of mankind--are indeed sacred things; {{and if any}} public measure is proved mischievously to affect them, the {{objection}} ought to be fatal to that measure, even if no charter at all could be set up against it. If these natural rights are further affirmed and declared by express covenants, if they are clearly defined and secured against chicane, against power and authority, by written instruments and positive engagements, {{they are in a}} still better condition: they partake not only of the sanctity of the object so secured, but of that solemn public faith itself which secures an object of such importance. Indeed, this formal recognition, by the sovereign power, of an original right in the subject, can never be subverted, but by rooting up the holding <b>radical</b> <b>principles</b> of government, and even of society itself. The charters which we call by distinction great are public instruments of this nature: I mean the charters of King John and King Henry the Third. The things secured by these instruments may, without any deceitful ambiguity, be very fitly called the chartered rights of men.|$|R
60|$|Jan. 20/38.--To-day {{there was}} a meeting on Canada at Sir R. Peel's. There were present Duke of Wellington, Lords Aberdeen, Ripon, Ellenborough, Stanley, Hardinge, and others.... Peel said he did not object to {{throwing}} out the government provided it were done by us on our own principles; but that to throw them out on <b>radical</b> <b>principles</b> would be most unwise. He agreed that less might have been done, but was not willing to take the responsibility of refusing what the government asked. He thought that this rebellion had given a most convenient opportunity for settling the question of the Canadian constitution, which had long been a thorny one and inaccessible; that if we postponed the settlement by giving the assembly another trial, the revolt would be forgotten, and in colder blood the necessary powers might be refused. He thought that when once you went into a measure of a despotic character, it was well to err, if at all, on the side of sufficiency; Lord Ripon strongly concurred. The duke sat with his hand to his ear, turning from one towards another round the circle as they took up the conversation in succession, and said nothing till directly and pressingly called upon by Peel, a simple but striking example of the self-forgetfulness of a great man.|$|R

40|$|This article {{draws upon}} the {{findings}} of a study at Liverpool Hope University (LHU) into the transformative nature of International Service-Learning (ISL) experiences for student participants. This research is concerned with the implications of these findings for professional practice, in particular how ISL is constructed in Higher Education policy and practice. Recognising the problematic nature of this endeavor, this article responds to a call for discussion around pedagogical approaches underpinning counter-cultural and critical service programmes aligned with the <b>radical</b> <b>principles</b> of the Catholic social teaching. This study is grounded in a holistic conceptualisation of transformative learning that demands looking beyond an epistemological process that involves shifts in worldview and habits of mind to an ontological process that accounts for changes to our being in the world. It investigated how LHU students describe their ongoing experience of ISL and explored the conditions for learning and the associated transformative processes and outcomes in this context. Data analysis involved phenomenological description, constant comparative thematic analysis followed by a critical, hermeneutical analysis. This article will explicate the themes of moral and spiritual learning that emerged {{as part of a broader}} framework. In particular, it was found that the development of authentic relationships between travelling companions, accompanying tutors and partners overseas is central to learning that is reciprocated and provides a model of the transformative process in this context. This article concludes that this presents a pedagogical approach grounded in social justice that enables ISL to reach its transformative potential...|$|R
