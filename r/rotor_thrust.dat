40|$|Abstract — This paper {{provides}} new {{results for}} the tracking control of a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The UAV has four input degrees of freedom, namely the magnitudes of the four <b>rotor</b> <b>thrusts,</b> {{that are used to}} control the six translational and rotational degrees of freedom, and to achieve asymptotic tracking of four outputs, namely, three position variables for the vehicle center of mass and the direction of one vehicle body-fixed axis. A globally defined model of the quadrotor UAV rigid body dynamics is introduced as a basis for the analysis. A nonlinear tracking controller is developed on the special Euclidean group SE(3) and it is shown to have desirable closed loop properties that are almost global. Several numerical examples, including an example in which the quadrotor recovers from being initially upside down, illustrate the versatility of the controller. I...|$|R
50|$|Controls {{vary the}} pitch of the main rotor blades {{cyclically}} throughout rotation. The pilot uses this to control {{the direction of the}} <b>rotor</b> <b>thrust</b> vector, which defines the part of the rotor disc where the maximum thrust develops. Collective pitch varies the magnitude of <b>rotor</b> <b>thrust</b> by increasing or decreasing thrust over the whole rotor disc at the same time. These blade pitch variations are controlled by tilting, raising, or lowering the swash plate with the flight controls. The vast majority of helicopters maintain a constant rotor speed (RPM) during flight, leaving the angle of attack of the blades as the sole means of adjusting thrust from the rotor.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rotor</b> <b>thrust</b> on a {{thrust bearing}} {{is not related}} to the engine thrust. It may even change {{direction}} at some RPM. The bearing load is determined by bearing life considerations. Although the aerodynamic loads on the compressor and turbine blades contribute to the <b>rotor</b> <b>thrust</b> they are small compared to cavity loads inside the rotor which result from the secondary air system pressures and sealing diameters on discs, etc. To keep the load within the bearing specification seal diameters are chosen accordingly as, many years ago, on the backface of the impeller in the de Havilland Ghost engine. Sometimes an extra disc known as a balance piston has to be added inside the rotor. An early turbojet example with a balance piston was the Rolls-Royce Avon.|$|E

50|$|The powered rotors of a {{tiltrotor}} (sometimes called proprotor) {{are mounted}} on rotating shafts or nacelles {{at the end}} of a fixed wing, and used for both lift and propulsion. For vertical flight, the rotors are angled to provide thrust upwards, lifting the way a helicopter rotor does. As the aircraft gains speed, the rotors progressively rotate or tilt forward, with the rotors eventually becoming perpendicular to the fuselage of the aircraft, similar to a propeller. In this mode, the wing provides the lift and the <b>rotor</b> provides <b>thrust.</b> The wing's greater efficiency helps the tiltrotor achieve higher speeds than helicopters.|$|R

Static thrust increased from the 3500lbf of the F.2/2 to in excess of , with a corresponding reduction in specific fuel consumption. Relative to the parent turbojet, the weight increase for this prop fan configuration was about 26%, compared to 53% for the F.3 turbofan.

5000|$|Whittle {{designed}} the centrifugal compressor to develop about 4:1 pressure ratio when, {{as far as}} he was aware, the best previously demonstrated performance in a single stage was about 2.5:1. He specified a double sided impeller to give his required air flow from a smaller diameter impeller than could be obtained from a single-sided one. The smaller impeller allowed a higher turbine speed which reduced the loading on the single stage turbine and improved its efficiency. The 16.5 in diameter turbine had to develop [...] to drive the compressor. One disadvantage of a double-sided impeller is the requirement, in an aircraft installation, for an intake with a plenum with its higher pressure losses. A disadvantage for the design of the <b>rotor</b> <b>thrust</b> bearing is no axial load from the impeller to balance that from the turbine.|$|E

A specific LV data processing method based on the momentum equation applied around a blade section has been developed to identify the contribution of the induced-drag component to the total sectional drag coefficient. From the computational approach, some improvements to a vortex embedding Full-potential method are checked by direct comparisons with test data.

The effect of helicopter rotor mean aerodynamics on inflow turbulence is studied {{within the framework of}} the turbulence rapid distortion theory developed by Pearson (1959) and Deissler (1961). The distorted inflow turbulence is related to the resultant noise by conventional broadband noise theory. A comparison of the distortion model with experimental data shows that the theoretical model is unable to totally explain observed increases in model rotor sound pressures with increased <b>rotor</b> mean <b>thrust.</b> Comparison of full scale rotor data with the theoretical model shows that a shear-type distortion may explain decreasing sound pressure levels with increasing thrust...|$|R
50|$|Turbojets supply {{bleed air}} from the {{compressor}} to the aircraft for the environmental control system, anti-icing, and fuel tank pressurization, for example. The engine itself needs air at various pressures and flow rates to keep it running. This air comes from the compressor, and without it, the turbines would overheat, the lubricating oil would leak from the bearing cavities, the <b>rotor</b> <b>thrust</b> bearings would skid or be overloaded, and ice would form on the nose cone. The {{air from the}} compressor, called secondary air, is used for turbine cooling, bearing cavity sealing, anti-icing, and ensuring that the rotor axial load on its thrust bearing will not wear it out prematurely. Supplying bleed air to the aircraft decreases {{the efficiency of the}} engine because it has been compressed, but then does not contribute to producing thrust. Bleed air for aircraft services is no longer needed on the turbofan-powered Boeing 787.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThis paper describes {{the development of}} a 6 -degree of freedom (6 -DOF), nonlinear, miniature rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (RW UAV) simulation environment using MathWorks Simulink simulation software. In addition to the modeling process, this research also conducts flight-path controller design using Proportional-Derivative (PD) control techniques. This model's development is motivated by the desire to enable a rapid prototyping platform for design and implementation of various flight control techniques with further seamless transition to the hardware in the loop (HIL) and flight-testing. The T-Rex Align 600 remote controlled helicopter with COTS autopilot was chosen as a prototype rotary UAV platform. The development of the nonlinear simulation model is implemented starting with extensive literature review of helicopter aerodynamics and flight dynamics theory and applying the mathematical models of the helicopter components to generate helicopter inertial frame motion simulations from operator commands. The primary helicopter components modeled in this thesis include the helicopter main <b>rotor</b> inflow, <b>thrust,</b> flapping dynamics, as well as the tail <b>rotor</b> inflow and <b>thrust</b> responses. The inertial frame motions are animated using the Flight Gear Version 0. 9. 8 software. After obtaining simulations with verifiable results, the nonlinear model is linearized about the hovering flight condition and a linear model is extracted. Lastly, the PD controller is designed and flight path software in the loop (SIL) test results are presented and explained. The SIL tests are conducted for autonomous flight along specified rectangular and figure- 8 flight paths. US Marine Corps (USMC) author...|$|R
50|$|The {{control is}} called the cyclic because it changes the pitch of the rotor blades cyclically. The result is to tilt the rotor disk in a {{particular}} direction, resulting in the helicopter moving in that direction. If the pilot pushes the cyclic forward, the rotor disk tilts forward, and the <b>rotor</b> produces a <b>thrust</b> in the forward direction. If the pilot pushes the cyclic to the side, the rotor disk tilts to that side and produces thrust in that direction, causing the helicopter to hover sideways.|$|R
50|$|A {{tiltrotor}} is {{an aircraft}} which generates lift and propulsion {{by way of}} one or more powered rotors (sometimes called proprotors) mounted on rotating engine pods or nacelles usually at the ends of a fixed wing or an engine mounted in the fuselage with drive shafts transferring power to rotor assemblies mounted on the wingtips. It combines the vertical lift capability of a helicopter with the speed and range of a conventional fixed-wing aircraft. For vertical flight, the rotors are angled so the plane of rotation is horizontal, lifting the way a helicopter rotor does. As the aircraft gains speed, the rotors are progressively tilted forward, with the plane of rotation eventually becoming vertical. In this mode the wing provides the lift, and the <b>rotor</b> provides <b>thrust</b> as a propeller. Since the rotors can be configured to be more efficient for propulsion (e.g. with root-tip twist) and it avoids a helicopter's issues of retreating blade stall, the tiltrotor can achieve higher speeds than helicopters.|$|R
