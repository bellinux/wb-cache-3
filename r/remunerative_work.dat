40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{issues and}} action plans concerning women in economic and sector analysis and in project design. The paper {{focuses on the}} majority of women who are poor. It emphasizes measures to include women in development that contribute to economic performance, poverty reduction, slower population growth, and other broad development objectives. The paper concludes that women already contribute far more economically than is usually recognized. By expanding women's economic choices, output and efficiency can be increased by enabling women to find their true comparative advantage. Women also tend to be disproportionately represented among the poor, so economic adjustment programs should deliberately take into consideration women's special needs and constraints. The same set of prices on agricultural products may also have a different incentive effect on men and women. With labor markets often segmented by gender, women are typically concentrated in fewer more traditional, less <b>remunerative</b> lines of <b>work.</b> Finally, improving education of women is probably the easiest program to target, but key health and family planning needs include stronger prenatal screening and care, help with delivery and a reduction of anemia.

60|$|Soon {{turning down}} an old Indian path, {{we saw the}} Gulf once more, and between us and it the sheet of cane cultivation, of which one estate ran up to our feet, 'like a bright green bay entered by a narrow strait among the dark forest.' Just before we came to it we passed another {{pleasant}} sight: more Coolie settlers, who had had lands granted them {{in lieu of the}} return passage to which they were entitled, were all busily felling wood, putting up bamboo and palm- leaf cabins, and settling themselves down, each one his own master, yet near enough to the sugar-estates below to get <b>remunerative</b> <b>work</b> whenever needful.|$|E

As for courage and ingenuity, he believed that he possessed both, but these qualities had not served him in very good stead in the attempts which he had made at different times to rescue the unfortunate members of the Royal Family from prison. His overwhelming egotism would not admit for a moment that in ingenuity and pluck the Scarlet Pimpernel and his English followers could outdo him, but he did wish to make quite sure that they would not interfere with him in the highly <b>remunerative</b> <b>work</b> of saving the Dauphin.|$|E
40|$|The induced demand model postulates that {{physicians}} respond to adverse income shocks by electing to perform more <b>remunerative</b> procedures. Recent <b>work</b> verifies {{the predictions of}} this model, finding a strong shift away from natural deliveries to the more highly reimbursed cesarean delivery in response to exogenous reductions in the fertility rate between 1970 - 1982. In light of this, the 10. 1 percent reduction in fertility rates and contemporaneous 13. 3 percent decline in cesarean rates between 1989 - 1996 appears to contradict the induced demand hypothesis. This paper reconciles the observed phenomenon by examining {{the role of the}} dramatic growth in managed care activity in this time period. We argue that while the inducement effect of declining fertility was pervasive in this period, its effect on cesarean rates was offset by the dramatic growth in managed care beginning in the late 1980 s. Central to our argument is the removal of physician financial incentives in delivery choice under managed care. Using county-level data for a subset of this time period and instrumental variables estimators, we find a strong negative association between managed care growth and cesarean rates that persists despite controls for fertility, birth severity, risk factors, demographics, state fixed effects and hospital characteristics...|$|R
30|$|The parameter γ {{determines the}} degree of {{substitution}} of one hour of OUP work for one hour of employment. Choosing a value of γ comprised between  0 and  1 means assigning a positive value to hours worked at home, but with a weight {{lower than those of}} market work. Using, for instance, lower productivity to justify such an assumption, however plausible it may be, raises the issue of why analogous productivity adjustments are not made for market jobs in different industries or requiring different skills. On the other hand, the method used to evaluate housework could help to pin down the value of γ (e.[*]g. Goldschmidt-Clermont 1982, 1993; Fitzgerald et al. 1996). With an “opportunity cost” valuation, housework must be at least as <b>remunerative</b> as a paid <b>work</b> obtainable in the market. If one hour of paid work is at the margin equivalent to one hour of household work, then it seems natural to set γ equal to  1. However, persons are rarely free to substitute market and non-market activities. The alternative “foregone expenses” valuation focuses on the costs saved by a household by engaging directly in housework. If we compute the cost of replacing the output of the OUP work with goods and services purchased in the market, we can estimate the implicit hourly wage for the OUP work. The ratio of this implicit wage rate to the average wage rate represents the relative price of the OUP work, and it might provide a reference for choosing γ.|$|R
40|$|Background: General Practitioners (GPs) can {{cope with}} {{workload}} by, among others, spending more hours in patient care or by spending less time per patient. The way GPs are paid {{might affect the}} way they cope with workload. From an economical point of view, capitation payment is an incentive to minimize the amount of work, contrary to a fee-for-service system, which makes more <b>work</b> <b>remunerative.</b> The main question {{of this study was}} ‘to what extent are the allocation of time and strategies to cope with workload affected by remuneration?’ The Dutch mixed system (until 2006) provides the opportunity to investigate the effects of both payment systems. Methods: 1) We carried out multilevel analyses (practice-level and GP-level) on four variables considering allocation of time: 2) Hours spent in patient care. 3) Booking-interval (scheduled time per patient on consultation hour). 4) Number of home visits. 5) Waiting time. Workload is measured as the number of contacts per week. Data origin from the second Dutch National Survey of General Practice. This study was carried out between 2000 and 2002 among 104 practices, comprising 195 GPs. These GPs were representative for the Dutch population of GPs. Data were collected using questionnaires, diaries, and electronic medical files. The models were corrected for relevant case mix, GP, and practice characteristics. The percentage of patients for which GPs received a capitation payment varied from 42 to 91 %. Results: Booking-intervals turned out to be shorter when the workload was higher. Contrary to our expectations, this negative effect of workload became weaker when the proportion of patients for which GPs received a capitation payment was higher. Furthermore, significant effects were found for the number of elderly, ethnic minorities, urbanization, and practice type. Conclusions The way GPs cope with workload and allocate time seems to be more determined by the composition of their practice population and their organizational setting than the remuneration system.

Both the major and Uncle John had felt this and it made the latter somewhat uneasy when he reflected that he was taking this girl to be the trusted nurse of Louise’s precious baby.

Best of all would be to be Ariosto himself, or one of his brotherhood. Then everything in nature would give you a hint, and every form of beauty be part of your stock.

Now in 1910 Fells continued:In reviews of succeeding editions of this book, as also in the reviews of the numerous other books, many of them most excellent in character, which have since been published dealing with the same subject, has been seen the growth of perception in the average professional mind that in the direction of cost accounting accountancy could do useful and <b>remunerative</b> <b>work</b> of the greatest service to the industrial and trading community. The need for scientific cost systems is being felt not only amongst industrial nations in the western, but also among those in the eastern hemisphere, and not the least pleasant incidents to me, in connection with the time and attention I have given to the subject, has been to advice with accountants in India thereon and to find Japanese accountants placing themselves in correspondence with me as to the best means of calling in Japan the importance of this subject.|$|E
