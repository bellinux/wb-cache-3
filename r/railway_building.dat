5|$|Travelling north, the old Town Hall {{building}} at Sunderland Road is a Grade II listed building. Built in 1902 and designed Henry Miller, the Felling U.D.C surveyor, {{this is another}} ashlar and sandstone building in the Baroque style. The five piers and lamp-holders guarding the town hall are also Grade II listed. The Brandling Junction <b>railway</b> <b>building,</b> now an urban studies centre, has been restored and is also a Grade II listed building. At the extreme north of the town at Riverside Park, the former engine house of Tyne Main Colliery, built in 1820, is also a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|The CLR and BSWR had {{separate}} surface {{buildings and}} lift shafts. The station buildings, which remain today as exits from the station, were built on very confined plots {{on either side}} of Argyll Street {{on the south side of}} Oxford Street, just east of the circus itself. The stations as originally built were entirely separate, but connecting passages were soon provided at platform level. The surviving Central London <b>Railway</b> <b>building</b> to the east of Argyll Street is the best surviving example of stations designed by Harry Bell Measures, and the Bakerloo line building to the west is a classic Leslie Green structure. Both are Grade II listed since 20 July 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{health service}} {{centers in the}} upazila include a health complex, an {{infectious}} diseases hospital, a railway TB hospital, 11 family planning centres and a veterinary treatment centre. Bangladesh Railway set up the hospital at Kumira in 1952 with a capacity of 150 beds. The capacity was reduced to 50 beds in 1994 as some focus was redirected to the Railway Hospital at Central <b>Railway</b> <b>Building</b> in Chittagong. Originally built to treat railway employees, the hospital now also treats people from the wider community. Malaria, dengue and other fevers, hepatitis, as well as respiratory infections including tuberculosis {{are some of the}} major health threats. The percentage of disabled in Sitakunda is reported to be the highest in Bangladesh, at 17% compared to the national average of 13%.|$|E

5|$|Watkin {{continued}} to harbour ambitions of linking his railway {{companies in the}} north and south of England, and while the construction of the Rickmansworth extension was underway planned two possible routes north from Rickmansworth across the Chilterns. One proposal envisaged the MR taking over or reaching agreement with the Aylesbury and Buckingham <b>Railway,</b> <b>building</b> a link between Rickmansworth and Aylesbury, and running over the A's line to the north. The A had close relations with the Great Western Railway, with whom they shared a station at Aylesbury. Watkin felt it possible that the A would reach agreement with the GWR instead and not cooperate with the MR.|$|E
5|$|No further {{changes were}} made to the canal after the {{extensions}} were completed, and satisfactory levels of traffic were carried. Fifty-two barges were operational in 1835, although their size is unknown. The canal was dredged in 1858, and shareholders began to receive dividends on their investments that same year. Most of the traffic was anthracite coal, which was shipped through Burry Port. Some culm was still shipped through Kidwelly. Major users in 1863 consisted of two collieries at Pwll y Llygod and one at Pontyberem. Success was short-lived, however, as railways started to appear in the region. Faced with the threat of the Carmarthenshire <b>Railway</b> <b>building</b> a branch to Pontyberem, the Canal Company obtained a new Act of Parliament, and became the Kidwelly and Burry Port Railway Company in 1865. The following year, the Burry Port and Gwendreath Valley Railway company was formed, by amalgamating with the Burry Port Harbour Company. (The spelling of Gwendraeth was wrong in the Act of Parliament.) The new company built a railway from Burry Port to Pontyberem, along the towpath over Pinged marsh, and on the bed of the canal elsewhere. This opened in July 1869. An extension to Kidwelly harbour followed in June 1873, and one to Cwmmawr in June 1886.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the person}} who was the last station master at Tapanui, the {{building}} widely identified as the Tapanui station was not the station.

25|$|Throughout his <b>railway</b> <b>building</b> career, but {{particularly}} on the South Devon and Cornwall Railways where economy was needed {{and there were many}} valleys to cross, Brunel made extensive use of wood for the construction of substantial viaducts; these have had to be replaced over the years as their primary material, Kyanised Baltic Pine, became uneconomical to obtain.|$|E
25|$|All of this {{provided}} the impulse for further development. Whilst the mills' function {{was to provide}} gunpowder for military use, either as a propellant for use in guns, or as a military explosive for demolition, etc., improvements effected there were a strong influence on private industry producing for civil activity - construction, mining, quarrying, tunneling, <b>railway</b> <b>building</b> etc. which created a massive demand for gunpowder in the 19th century.|$|E

25|$|The land boom <b>railway</b> <b>building</b> hit a peak {{with the}} {{construction}} of the Rosstown Railway between Elsternwick and Oakleigh. Built by William Murry Ross, the line was planned from the 1870s to serve a sugar beet mill near Caufield. Construction commenced in 1883, followed by rebuilding in 1888. Ross's debt grew, and he attempted to sell the line many times without success. The line never opened to traffic and was later dismantled.|$|E
25|$|Work on the Â£10 million {{regeneration}} of {{the station}} and surrounding areas {{as part of the}} Chester Renaissance programme was completed in 2007. The development includes a new roof, improved customer facilities and better access to the station. A small plaque commemorating Thomas Brassey, one of the world's greatest <b>railway</b> <b>building</b> contractors in the early to mid-19th century, can be seen on the wall opposite the new booking office. The station marks one end of the Baker Way, a footpath leading to Delamere railway station.|$|E

A tourniquet had been applied, but it was not deemed possible to do a field amputation, so he was made comfortable. His wife arrived from Liverpool and he was able to make his will. At nine in the evening, William Huskisson finally succumbed to his injury.|$|E

25|$|By the mid 1870s the LB had {{recovered}} its financial stability through {{a policy of}} encouraging the more intensive use of lines and reducing operating costs. Between 1870 and 1889 annual revenue rose from Â£1.3 million to Â£2.4 million, whilst its operating costs rose from Â£65,000 to just over Â£1 million. The LB was able to embark upon new <b>railway</b> <b>building</b> and improvements to infrastructure. Some new lines passed through sparsely populated areas and merely provided shorter connections to towns that were already on the railway network, and so were unlikely to be profitable, but the LB found itself under pressure from local communities wanting a rail connection, and was frightened that they would otherwise be developed by rivals.|$|E
25|$|Gaidai {{was born}} on January 30, 1923 in Svobodny, Amur Oblast where he is commemorated by a statue. His father Iov Isidorovich Gaidai came from a Ukrainian family of serfs of the Poltava Governorate. At the age of 22 {{he was sentenced to}} several years of katorga for revolutionary {{activity}} and sent to the Far East to work at the railway. Leonid's mother Maria Ivanovna Lubimova was born in the Ryazan Oblast to Russian parents. She met Iov through her brother Egor, also a katorga worker who sent her a photo of his friend along with a marriage proposal. After Gaidai's term expired, they settled down in the Amur Oblast where Gaidai continued working at the <b>railway</b> <b>building</b> site.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the invasion, many camp residents ended up living in temporary shelters elsewhere. The camp itself became the site of intense efforts at documenting, recording and expressing the experiences of those displaced and affected by the incursion. In discussing how to properly honor those who had fallen, one proposal suggested leaving the destruction, at least in the Hawashin neighborhood, exactly as it was, as a memorial and testament to struggle and sacrifice. Camp residents, however, insisted that the camp be rebuilt almost exactly as it had been, while also establishing a museum of memory in the Old Hijaz <b>Railway</b> <b>building.</b> They rejected the proposal of the Israeli housing minister to rebuild the camp at a nearby site with enlarged roads, viewing it as an attempt to erase the political reality of the camps whose existence they see as living testaments to the 1948 Palestinian exodus.|$|E
