500|$|Despite early struggles, Olajuwon said: [...] "Basketball is {{something}} that is so unique. That immediately I pick up the game and, you know, <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the life for me. All the other sports just become obsolete." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{appreciate}} {{other kinds}} of drummers who play differently, but it's not my style or what works for this band. I get [...] sometimes, and I go through periods where it really bothers me. But then I think about it, and I <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> what is really needed for this band. And I just try {{to have as much}} fun with it as possible ... I just know the way [...] plays so well at this point that I always know kind of what he's going to do. I can always sense where he's going with things just by the mood he's in or the attitude or how the song is going. Once in a while, he throws me for a loop, but I can usually keep him where I want him." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{legal and}} {{agricultural}} communities, {{as well as}} the public, must be educated to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not simply an issue of corporate profits. As shown with the example of Roundup Ready soybeans grown in Argentina and Brazil, the future of American agriculture may be jeopardized if American farmers alone bear the costs of the research and development for development of new GM varieties. Extending patent protection for plants to the international level ... could be an important next step.|$|E
60|$|Joe <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> good advice, {{and went}} {{at once to}} confer with Mrs. Byram and Fred.|$|R
50|$|Bhishma {{instantly}} <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> Drona, {{and asked}} him to become the Guru of the Kuru princes, training them in advanced military arts.|$|R
60|$|As {{they stepped}} out into the {{darkness}} Curtis <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> their last walk together, and the thought was both sweet and sad.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is not {{a matter}} {{altogether}} for levity, Anna," [...] she said. [...] "Your sister's future is at stake. I imagine that even you must <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> of some importance." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Raimon {{spoke of}} this. [...] "I saw 'Black Mose' {{as he stood}} in the streets of Wagon Wheel, the most famous dead-shot in the State. I can't <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the same man. He's gentle as a babe now; he was as terrible and as {{beautiful}} as a tiger then." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For heaven's sake talk sense," [...] said Gerald querulously. [...] "Do {{you suppose}} that man Cracknell {{would keep the}} play on if she wasn't in it? He would close the show in a second, and where would I be then? You don't seem to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a big chance for me. I'd look a fool {{throwing}} it away." ...|$|E
60|$|Marjorie <b>was</b> {{beginning}} to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{going to be}} a very serious affair indeed for her--and that she was totally unprepared to meet it.|$|R
50|$|In {{two cases}} {{the doctor was}} reprimanded for not being present while the patient drank the potion. They said they had not <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> required.|$|R
50|$|Roman asks Burgess to go {{with him}} to San Diego; however, after <b>realizing</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> what she wants to do, she decides to stay in Chicago.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to hear that. Well, I'll be around in the morning, and I am sure you will <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a good thing, after you have thought it over," [...] said Job Haskers, with calm assurance, and then he and the elderly man left the room. Dave and Roger saw them {{separate}} in the main hall of the hotel, the old gentleman going upstairs, and Job Haskers out into the storm.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} I {{can tell you}} exactly what the {{questions}} were," [...] Arnold continued, [...] "because they concerned some matters in which Mrs. Weatherley and her brother were chiefly concerned. To tell you the truth, ever since that night when I went to Hampstead to dine, the oddest things seem to have happened to me. I have to pinch myself sometimes to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> London and that I am a clerk in the office of a wholesale provision merchant. When I let myself go, I seem to have been living in an unreal world, full of strange excitements--a veritable Arabian Nights." ...|$|E
6000|$|Next after curiosity come those {{desires and}} motives that one shares perhaps with some social beasts, {{but far more}} so as a {{conscious}} thing with men alone. These desires and motives all centre on a clearly apprehended [...] "self" [...] in relation to [...] "others"; they are the essentially egotistical group. They are self-assertion in all its forms. I have dealt with motives toward gratification and motives towards experience; this set of motives is {{for the sake of}} oneself. Since they are the most acutely conscious motives in unthinking men, there is a tendency on the part of unthinking philosophers to speak of them as though vanity, self-seeking, self-interest were the only motives. But one has but to reflect on what has gone before to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not so. One finds these [...] "self" [...] motives vary with the mental power and training of the individual; here they are fragmentary and discursive, there drawn tight together into a coherent scheme. Where they are weak they mingle with the animal motives and curiosity like travellers in a busy market-place, but where the sense of self is strong they become rulers and regulators, self-seeking becomes deliberate and sustained {{in the case of the}} human being, vanity passes into pride.|$|E
5000|$|Boltzmann <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> just an {{expression}} of the Euler-integrated fundamental equation of thermodynamics. Identifying E as the internal energy, the Euler-integrated fundamental equation states that : ...|$|R
5000|$|Allmusic {{awarded the}} album 4½ stars and its review by Scotty Yanow states, [...] "It seems strange to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> Mose Allison's only {{recording}} during the 1973-1981 period".|$|R
5000|$|Then {{the father}} <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{the exact time}} at which Jesus had said to him, [...] "Your son will live." [...] So he and his whole {{household}} believed.|$|R
50|$|In the ritzy bedroom, Cookie is {{dressing}} Jimmy for {{his wedding}} as Billie enters to return his wallet. Jimmy and Billie both <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{the last time}} they'll ever see each other ("Will You Remember Me?").|$|E
5000|$|Despite early struggles, Olajuwon {{quickly became}} {{taken into the}} game: [...] "Basketball is {{something}} that is so unique. That immediately I pick up the game and, you know, <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the life for me. All the other sports just become obsolete." ...|$|E
50|$|They go {{into the}} cabin and {{retrieve}} his backpack. Scott sees {{that there is a}} basement, and a sub-basement, and wants to explore more, but Penny persuades him to leave. They <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the home of the almost legendary and mysterious artist, Mr. Jones (Mark Steger).|$|E
60|$|Deane {{looked up}} a little curiously. For {{the first time he}} <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> not simply a casual invitation. His {{prospective}} father-in-law had really something to say to him.|$|R
60|$|He stooped down, and {{her arms}} closed around {{him like a}} soft yoke. But he kissed her {{forehead}} so lightly <b>that</b> she scarcely <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> almost his first caress.|$|R
50|$|Lakshmi can {{identify}} closely with Rajamma. After Rajamma's suicide, she tells Surya that she wishes {{to return to}} Kishtayya. However, she <b>realizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> impossible, and Surya promises to look after her.|$|R
50|$|Back in the TM-31, Yu finds a key in {{the book}} he is writing that leads him to {{discover}} a diorama with a clock that points to a time. TAMMY and Yu <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a clue to where they can find Yu's father, but also {{realize that they are}} headed back to the hanger so Yu's past self can shoot him.|$|E
5000|$|In October 2011, it was {{reported}} that several lay Catholics in Toowoomba had expressed concern that Morris still had a high profile in the diocese, giving a public lecture, in-service talks to teachers and officiating at parish anniversaries. Cardinal George Pell said to CNA [...] "if he is a loyal man of the Church he'll <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> totally inappropriate and that won't continue. That is my hope." ...|$|E
5000|$|Zachary Quinto {{provides}} {{the voice of}} a Robot Chicken-parodied Sylar in the episode [...] "Bionic Cow". In it, he kills a man named [...] "Uncle Glen", who is apparently able to remove his fingers, failing to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a simple sleight of hand trick to impress young children. He instead inherits Glen's power of [...] "explosive diarrhea," [...] remarking that [...] "every once in a while, this power backfires".|$|E
50|$|The last quagga {{in captivity}} died at Artis on 12 August 1883. At the time, because all zebras were {{referred}} to as quagga, nobody <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the last quagga alive until years later.|$|R
50|$|After {{his initial}} forays {{in the drug}} market Ryan <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a market <b>that</b> could be {{expanded}} and soon he had built a drug network that spread throughout Quebec, Ontario and the Atlantic provinces.|$|R
50|$|Everything changes {{when one}} of the {{children}} goes missing. A frantic Janice leaves the play, and when the child <b>is</b> finally found, <b>realizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the life she wants, which she intends to share with Jim.|$|R
5000|$|His {{mortal remains}} {{are located in}} the altar in the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Rome, along with several of his relics. Also on display is the Cross which {{allegedly}} spoke to Camillus, and asked him, [...] "Why are you afraid? Do you not <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not your work but mine?" [...] which has become the motto associated with St. Camillus, as well as healthcare workers who were inspired by him.|$|E
50|$|Data {{fields that}} are less identifying, such as Date of Attendance, are usually not pseudonymized. It is {{important}} to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> because too much statistical utility is lost in doing so, not because the data cannot be identified. For example, given prior knowledge of a few attendance dates {{it is easy to}} identify someone's data in a pseudonymized dataset by selecting only those people with that pattern of dates. This is an example of an Inference attack.|$|E
50|$|The Sergeant {{begins to}} <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{not a normal}} road, and these are not just wounded soldiers. He tells Lavinia that there is {{something}} {{down at the end of}} the road, and that he has to find out what it is. As the Sergeant turns to leave, Lavinia moves in front of him and tries to persuade him to stay. Suddenly they hear a man's voice singing a familiar song. The man is Lavinia's husband, Jud.|$|E
6000|$|Prescott <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{complimentary}} to him. She {{had made}} it clear that he was not a stranger, but one of the people she trusted. The effect was to render him somewhat embarrassed, but Gertrude resumed: ...|$|R
2500|$|... "The Pocket Man" [...] {{was during}} one {{period of the}} {{investigations}} known as [...] "The Bandage Man", {{first time in a}} case from Bergen in 1980. The police <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the same offender in the autumn of 2007.|$|R
5000|$|... “The film’s success, in all senses, is {{even more}} {{remarkable}} when one <b>realizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> Ginzburg’s first full-length feature film. Generation P should vault its director Victor Ginzburg, to the top rank of filmmakers working in Russian today." [...] Anthony Anemone, Kinokultura ...|$|R
