5|$|Vizzini {{initially}} {{supported the}} separatist movement in Sicily. On December 6, 1943, Vizzini participated {{at the first}} clandestine <b>regional</b> <b>convention</b> of the Sicilian separatists movement of the Sicilian Independence Movement (Movimento Indipendentista Siciliano - MIS) in Catania. Other prominent Mafia bosses like Giuseppe Genco Russo, Gaetano Filippone, Michele Navarra and Francesco Paolo Bontade did not hide their sympathies for the separatists either. The separatists benefited from covert support of the OSS. As Italy experienced a leftward drift in 1943-1944, the American military became increasingly concerned about their future prospects in Italy. The island's naval bases and strategic location in the Mediterranean provided a possible future counterbalance to a Communism on the Italian mainland. The Italian Communist Party's membership had doubled and the largely left inspired resistance movement in the north was gathering strength.|$|E

25|$|The College Republicans summer 1973 {{convention}} at the Lake of the Ozarks {{resort in}} Missouri was quite contentious. Rove's opponent was Robert Edgeworth of Michigan. The other major candidate, Terry Dolan of California, dropped out, supporting Edgeworth. A {{number of states}} had sent two competing delegates, because Rove and his supporters had made credential challenges at state and regional conventions. For example, after the Midwest <b>regional</b> <b>convention,</b> Rove forces had produced {{a version of the}} Midwestern College Republicans constitution which differed significantly from the constitution that the Edgeworth forces were using, in order to justify the unseating of the Edgeworth delegates on procedural grounds, including delegations, such as Ohio and Missouri, which had been certified earlier by Rove himself. In the end, there were two votes, conducted by two convention chairs, and two winners—Rove and Edgeworth, each of whom delivered an acceptance speech. After the convention, both Edgeworth and Rove appealed to Republican National Committee Chairman George H. W. Bush, each contending that he was the new College Republican chairman.|$|E

This bible was offered free of charge to every single one that attended the convention and will be so to all those who [...] "desire an accurate, understandable translation of God's Word."

2500|$|Plans for an {{independent}} national assembly for Pakistan began as early as spring 1954. A <b>regional</b> <b>convention</b> in Karachi in 1956 had 17 delegates. With independence from India proceeding, the Bahá'ís of East and West Pakistan elected a separate Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly from India in 1957, witnessed by Hand of the Cause Shu'á'u'llah 'Alá'í. The Bahá'ís elected to this first national assembly included Isfandiar Bakhtiari, Chaudhri Abdur Rehman, Faridoon Yazameidi, A.C. Joshi, M.H. IImi, Abdul Abbas Rizvi, M.A. Latif, Nawazish Ali Shah, and Mehboob Iiahi Qureshi. Joshi in particular was then the Chairman of the national assembly and had been elected to assemblies since 1947 and eventually in other institutions. The new national assembly saw to the publishing {{of a history of}} the Bahá'í Faith in Pakistan in 1957. In 1960 when Mason Remey made his unsuccessful claims for leadership, a small group of Bahá'ís in Pakistan accepted his claims and published some materials from 1965 through 1972 but have not been active since then. This Hereditary group never formed a significant group around the world. In 1961 the national assembly held a reception to honor the dedication of the Bahá'í House of Worship in Australia by inviting Australian and other diplomats as well as judges of Pakistani courts, business leaders and college professors while the local assembly of Sukkur hosted a regional summer school. In 1962 one was hosted by the local assembly of Quetta. In 1963 the Universal House of Justice, the international governing body of the Bahá'ís, was elected and all nine members of the Pakistani National Spiritual Assembly participated in the voting. In 1964 Hand of the Cause Tarázu'lláh Samandari visited Bahá'ís and social leaders in Dacca, East Pakistan at the time. From 1946 through the 1980s the Bahá'í publishing trust published a variety of works oriented to youth.228, 229, 304, 370}} ...|$|E
