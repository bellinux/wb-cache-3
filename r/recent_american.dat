5|$|American {{televangelist}} Pat Robertson, {{with his}} 1991 best-selling book The New World Order, {{became the most}} prominent Christian popularizer of conspiracy theories about <b>recent</b> <b>American</b> history.

More <b>recent</b> <b>American</b> creations include hip hop and house music. American pop stars such as Presley, Michael Jackson, and Madonna have become global celebrities, as have contemporary musical artists such as Taylor Swift, Britney Spears, Katy Perry, and Beyoncé as well as hip hop artists Jay-Z, Eminem and Kanye West. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales.|$|E
5|$|Rice's {{books have}} sold nearly 100 million copies, placing her {{among the most}} popular authors in <b>recent</b> <b>American</b> history. While {{reaction}} to her early works was initially mixed, she became more popular with critics and readers in the 1980s. Her writing style and the literary content of her works have been deeply analyzed by literary commentators. She was married to poet and painter Stan Rice for 41 years, from 1961 until his death from brain cancer in 2002 at age 60. She and Stan had two children, Michele, who died of leukemia at age five, and Christopher, who is also an author.|$|E

25|$|As a {{young man}} of letters, Pavese had a {{particular}} interest in English-language literature, graduating from the University of Turin with a thesis on the poetry of Walt Whitman.

In those years, Pavese translated both classic and <b>recent</b> <b>American</b> and British authors that were then new to the Italian public.|$|E

25|$|James Ronald Ryun (born April 29, 1947) is {{a former}} American {{politician}} and track and field athlete.

25|$|European {{versions}} of the game give the Marshal the highest number (10), while the initial American versions give the Marshal the lowest number (1) to show the highest value (i.e. it is the #1 or most powerful tile). More <b>recent</b> <b>American</b> {{versions of}} the game, which adopted the European system, caused considerable complaint among American players {{who grew up in}} the 1960s and 1970s.

25|$|He {{commissioned}} Patrick Keely, an Irish immigrant himself, {{to design}} the cathedral, one of 500 churches he would eventually build. Keely was not a design pioneer, but he followed his era's architectural trends closely. For the cathedral he was most influenced by the ideas of British architect Augustus Pugin, as epitomized in Pugin's book True Principles and his St George the Martyr Southwark church in London, both dating to 1841. As a resident of Brooklyn, Keely would also have been familiar with <b>recent</b> <b>American</b> applications of the Gothic Revival style, such as Richard Upjohn's Trinity Church and James Renwick's Grace Church, both Episcopal churches in Manhattan. For Immaculate Conception, {{he seems to have}} combined the walls of those two churches with the twin-tower facade of Calvary Church, another Renwick work then under construction.|$|E

25|$|The actor {{followed}} The Godfather with Bernardo Bertolucci's 1972 film Last Tango in Paris opposite Maria Schneider, but Brando's highly noted performance {{threatened to}} be overshadowed by an uproar over the sexual {{content of the}} film. Brando portrays a <b>recent</b> <b>American</b> widower named Paul, who begins an anonymous sexual relationship with a young, betrothed Parisian woman named Jeanne. As with previous films, Brando refused to memorize his lines for many scenes; instead, he wrote his lines on cue cards and posted them around the set for easy reference, leaving Bertolucci {{with the problem of}} keeping them out of the picture frame. The film features several intense, graphic scenes involving Brando, including Paul anally raping Jeanne using butter as a lubricant and Paul's angry, emotionally charged final confrontation with the corpse of his dead wife. The controversial movie was a hit, however, and Brando made the list of Top Ten Box Office Stars for the last time. The voting membership of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences again nominated Brando for Best Actor, his seventh nomination. Although Brando won the 1973 New York Film Critics Circle Awards, the actor did not appear at the ceremony or send a representative to pick up the award if he won.|$|E
25|$|On May 3, 2006, Chen {{canceled}} {{plans to}} pass through the United States on his way to Latin America. He was hoping to stop by either San Francisco or New York City to refuel and stay overnight, but the US refused his request instead limiting him to a brief refuelling stopover in Anchorage, Alaska where Chen {{would not be allowed to}} step off the plane. Chen and Taiwan saw this as a snub and led to Chen's cancellation. The trip to Latin America will continue, however, without a US stopover. The US State Department claimed that the Alaska stopover offer was consistent with its previous accommodations. However, former Taiwan president Lee Teng-hui was granted a visit to Cornell University eleven years ago. More recently, in addition, Taiwan's leaders have in general been granted permission to stopover in the United States for brief periods before continuing on to other countries. This <b>recent</b> <b>American</b> stance is interpreted by Taiwan to be an expression of the increasing irritation the United States feels towards Taiwan and Chen's seemingly pro-independence gestures. Chen attended the inauguration of Óscar Arias, the president of Costa Rica, one of the few countries that recognized the Republic of China at that time. Laura Bush was also present to represent U.S. president George W. Bush. Chen seized the opportunity, approached her and shook her hands, while Chen's aide produced a camera immediately for an impromptu photo-op. Chen's supporters saw this act as a step forward in Taiwan's struggle for diplomatic recognition, while his detractors claimed that it was a grave breach of international etiquette and put Taiwan to shame.|$|E
