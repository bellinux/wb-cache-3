50|$|The Romans {{established}} the port, {{and with the}} Via Domitia running close they also established a rest and recreation centre. Many legionnaires took their discharge at Marseillan, and with it a grant of land - on which they <b>grew</b> <b>vines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Certain plants always <b>grow</b> as <b>vines,</b> {{while a few}} <b>grow</b> as <b>vines</b> {{only part}} of the time. For instance, poison ivy and {{bittersweet}} can grow as low shrubs when support is not available, but will become vines when support is available.|$|R
50|$|Rovio is a {{municipality}} in {{the district}} of Lugano in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland. Traditionally Rovio has been an agricultural community, raising livestock and <b>growing</b> <b>vines,</b> but today many of its houses are occupied by commuters, largely travelling into the city of Lugano.|$|R

50|$|The Central Coastal Plain (known as Dan) and {{the rolling}} hills of the Judean Lowlands make up the second coastal region, in which grapes have been {{traditionally}} grown. This is the second largest area for <b>growing</b> <b>vines</b> in Israel, as it has a coastal Mediterranean climate: hot, humid summers and warm, mild winters. It is a large region for Carmel and it supplies the Rishon LeZion Winery.|$|R
50|$|Antiquarian {{artefacts}} {{show that}} <b>vine</b> <b>growing</b> occurred {{even in the}} Roman period. <b>Vine</b> <b>growing</b> came to stay from the 11th century in this area. The ethnic German settlers and the Capuchin monks started to <b>grow</b> grape <b>vines</b> {{in the beginning of}} the 18th century. The oenological boom lasted until the Phylloxera bane in 1875-1880 that killed most of the vineyards. Afterwards, Ezerjó became the most important type of wine in Mór, which now belongs to the Hungaricums. Ezerjó is a heavy, late-ripening sort of vine.|$|R

50|$|Attempts to <b>grow</b> <b>vines</b> in the Americas {{began in}} Hispaniola {{during the second}} voyage of Columbus in 1494. Ferdinand II of Aragon, King of Spain, banned the {{planting}} of vines in Hispaniola in 1503. After the establishment of vines in Hispaniola in early 16th century vineyards were successfully established in Mexico in 1524. Hernán Cortés, conqueror of Mexico, promoted the establishment of vines and made it in 1524 a requirement for Spanish settlers that wanted to acquire land in the Mexican Plateau to establish vineyards in their lands. The <b>growing</b> of <b>vines</b> in Peru {{is known to have}} been ventured by Bartolomé de Terrazas and Francisco de Carabantes in the 1540s. The latter established vineyards in Ica from where vines then were taken into Chile and Argentina.|$|R
25|$|The {{major reason}} {{for the success of}} {{winemaking}} in the Bordeaux region is an excellent environment for <b>growing</b> <b>vines.</b> The geological foundation of the region is limestone, leading to a soil structure that is heavy in calcium. The Gironde estuary dominates the regions along with its tributaries, the Garonne and the Dordogne rivers, and together irrigate the land and provide an Atlantic Climate, also known as an oceanic climate, for the region.|$|R
50|$|To {{the west}} of the ridge lies black {{rendzina}} soil which is poorly drained, and so is much less favourable for vines. There is also a 'transitional', or brown rendzina, soil which <b>grows</b> <b>vines</b> quite successfully. This geological complexity led to many disputes during an eight-year period before Coonawarra was entered on the Register of Protected Names. At least one vineyard (belonging to Penola High School) has the boundary pass through the middle.|$|R

50|$|Isla de Maipo is an {{agricultural}} community, primarily devoted to <b>growing</b> <b>vines</b> and other fruits typical of Mediterranean climate, such as lemons, avocados and apples. ¨The most important wineries {{in the town}} are De Martino (Santa Inés), Canepa, Viña Tarapacá, Santa Ema and Terramater. Also, there are other small companies that produce wine for bigger wineries. However, {{one of the most}} important problems in Isla de Maipo is still the unemployment and the small number of qualified jobs.|$|R
5000|$|At Brading Villa a {{field system}} can be seen near Brading Down; the remains {{associated}} with the villa {{can be seen as}} low banks. The chalk downland was cultivated in prehistoric and Roman times because the light chalk soil was not too difficult to plough. [...] It is very likely indeed that the Romans <b>grew</b> <b>vines,</b> as the climate was then warmer than it is now, and on this basis nearby Adgestone Vineyard claims to be the oldest in Britain.|$|R

50|$|Located in Garden Place, Te Tiaho o Matariki {{was created}} by Neil Miller. The {{sculpture}} represents Pleiades {{in the form of}} a <b>growing</b> <b>vine,</b> with the stars of Matariki forming the fruit on the vine. It honours the city’s first inhabitants (Garden Place was first used by Maori as a garden and observatory); and celebrates the horticultural heritage of the name of the city’s civic plaza: Garden Place. The curving vine-like form of the sculpture also references the nearby Waikato River which snakes through the city.|$|R
50|$|Today {{the gardens}} include 125 acre of woodlands, fields, wetlands, and a 4 acre formal garden with greenhouse. Two {{acres of the}} formal gardens {{comprise}} the Greenhouse Gardens (designed 1917, 1920, 1931) which centers around a sunken garden divided into four quadrants, with grass lawns, border plantings, rose gardens, theme gardens, specimen trees, and boxwood hedges, as well as tea-houses, fountains, and pergolas. The other half contains the Fruit, Cut Flower, and Nicer Vegetable Garden (1921), which <b>grows</b> <b>vines,</b> vegetables, climbing roses, and espaliered fruit trees.|$|R
5000|$|Significant plantings {{have been}} {{happening}} {{across the south}} of the country with a number of farmers contract <b>growing</b> <b>vines</b> for some of the major English producers. Farmers are looking at the potential benefits of <b>growing</b> <b>vines</b> as the return per tonne for grapes over more traditional crops are not to be ignored. A field of wheat might yield 3 tonnes per acre at around £120 per tonne. Growing grapes could yield 3 to 4 tonnes per acre at around £950 to £1100 per tonne. One concern is that growers need to invest money for no initial return, as crops tend to come in the third or fourth year. Another concern is that grape production in the climate is highly variable: [...] "In England, it is only in about 2 years in every 10 that grape production will be really good, 4 years will be average and 4 years poor or terrible - largely due to weather and/or disease exacerbated by weather." [...] However English vineyards share in common European weather patterns so 2006 was a bumper year, 2007 saw ripe grapes but low volumes, 2008 was very poor, but both 2009 and 2010 were good years. 2011 was average, 2012 dreadful, and 2013 good Total British cereal production is not so variable.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 14th century, the Schaerbeek {{lands that}} belonged to the Lords of Kraainem were sold and reconverted into a hunting ground. The {{official}} entry of the visiting Dukes of Burgundy into Brussels, their second capital, was also through Schaerbeek, where they had to swear to uphold the city's privileges. The game reservation and the rural character of the village lasted until {{the end of the}} 18th century. The areas not covered by woods were used to cultivate vegetables and <b>grow</b> <b>vines.</b> In 1540, Schaerbeek counted 112 houses and 600 inhabitants.|$|R
