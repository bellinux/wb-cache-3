500|$|The {{read-through}} for [...] "Cold War" [...] {{took place}} on 6 June 2012, with filming beginning on 13 June. For the submarine setting, the cast would be sprayed in between every take. The scenes in which the characters are drenched in water were achieved by constantly pouring [...] "gallons and gallons of water" [...] on the cast. Coleman found the experience fun, while Smith said that it made acting easier. Coleman said, [...] "The whole make-up process was reversed as they would damp us down {{in the morning and}} <b>rub</b> <b>my</b> mascara off!" [...] For the shots of the submarine in the ocean, a model was used. It was suspended upside-down with [...] "shredded feathers" [...] blown at it to give the effect of being under the sea.|$|E
60|$|When I {{heard those}} words I had to <b>rub</b> <b>my</b> eyes {{to make sure}} that I was awake.|$|E
60|$|I <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> forehead, for {{the doctor}} had {{incidentally}} thrown out an embarrassing idea.|$|R
60|$|And at that up I jumped, and, <b>rubbing</b> <b>my</b> eyes, ran to a {{loophole}} in the wall.|$|R
60|$|It was Dibble arousing me. I was {{not long}} in obeying his summons. I hopped out of <b>my</b> bunk and <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> eyes.|$|R
60|$|BLANCO. I cant {{change my}} soul, Elder: it changes me--sometimes. Feemy: I'm too pale. Let me <b>rub</b> <b>my</b> cheek against yours, darling.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, yes, it's a bottle," [...] {{said the}} woman, with an {{assumption}} of virtuous frankness. [...] "It's whisky; I {{got to have}} something to <b>rub</b> <b>my</b> rheumatism with." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{shoes are}} {{beginning}} to <b>rub</b> <b>my</b> heels," [...] Tompkins said, [...] "so I will take the shortest way and risk it. I don't see we can go far out of our way." ...|$|E
60|$|I fancied for the moment, as {{most people}} would under similar circumstances, that I must be dreaming. I sat up, and <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> eyes.|$|R
5000|$|... "And here I am <b>rubbing</b> <b>my</b> fabulous new car in her face," [...] Bree says, [...] "I feel awful. Thank God I didn't {{show her}} how it parks itself!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'First {{accumulate}} {{a mass of}} Facts: {{and then}} construct a Theory.' That, I believe, is the true Scientific Method. I sat up, <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> eves, and began to accumulate Facts.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, father, I {{really think}} I could {{do some good}} with it. For instance, I could just <b>rub</b> <b>my</b> lamp, and then have all your trees pruned for you, at once, without any further trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Command my services, sir," [...] said Sam, {{with a wave}} of his hand. [...] "I am your servant, your Eastern slave, ready, if need be, to {{prostrate}} {{myself in}} the earth and <b>rub</b> <b>my</b> nose in the dust." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will forgive}} me," [...] said the monk, meekly from under loads of white beard, [...] "but I fear I do not understand; {{was it in}} order that I might <b>rub</b> <b>my</b> {{shoulder}} against men of all kinds that you put me inside this thing?" ...|$|E
60|$|And he <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> {{hand over}} the cold nose and jowls of a dog. A dog it {{certainly}} was, with the shape and the smooth, short coat of a pointer.|$|R
60|$|For a {{long time}} I sat there, yawning and <b>rubbing</b> <b>my</b> face. At last I {{struggled}} to rise. It made me feel that I was lifting a weight. I stood up.|$|R
2500|$|Diogenes {{is said to}} have masturbated {{in public}}. On the indecency of him masturbating in public he would say, [...] "If only it were as easy to banish hunger by <b>rubbing</b> <b>my</b> belly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'For my part,' said Mrs Lovat, {{breathing}} the faint wind that was {{rising out of}} the west, 'I'd sigh; I'd <b>rub</b> <b>my</b> eyes; I'd thank God for such an exciting dream; and I'd turn comfortably over and go to sleep again. I'm all for Arthur--absolutely--back against the wall.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, bosh!' said Bobby. 'I {{thought the}} man had gone out long ago only only I didn't care to take my hand away. <b>Rub</b> <b>my</b> arm down, there's a good chap. What a grip the brute has! I'm chilled to the marrow!' He passed {{out of the tent}} shivering.|$|E
60|$|There was {{an appalling}} {{scrimmage}} for a moment; then, before I could fairly <b>rub</b> <b>my</b> eyes, the hare had vanished utterly, and a savage ring of lynxes were licking their chops hungrily, glaring and growling {{at each other}} to see which it was that had gotten the biggest mouthful.|$|E
60|$|My wife rushed at him, {{but whether}} she embraced him or only shook his hands I cannot say; for I had the {{knapsack}} {{in one hand}} and was <b>rubbing</b> <b>my</b> eyes with the other.|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I wouldn't {{care so much}} if {{the brute}} hadn't scoured the skin off my face. He had {{whiskers}} as sharp and stiff as sandpaper. And when I jerked away he <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> cheek with them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! {{a mystery}} is it?" [...] I cried, <b>rubbing</b> <b>my</b> hands. [...] "This is very piquant. I am much obliged {{to you for}} {{bringing}} us together. 'The proper study of mankind is man,' you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Boys, is {{this the}} way you treat a watchmate" [...] demanded Israel reproachfully, [...] "trying to cheer up his friends? Shame on ye, boys. Come, let's be sociable. Spin us a yarn, one of ye. Meantime, <b>rub</b> <b>my</b> back for me, another," [...] and very {{confidently}} he leaned against his neighbor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, bosh!" [...] said Bobby. [...] "I {{thought the}} man had gone out long ago--only--only I didn't care to take my hand away. <b>Rub</b> <b>my</b> arm down, there's a good chap. What a grip the brute has! I'm chilled to the marrow!" [...] He passed {{out of the tent}} shivering.|$|E
6000|$|Tommie {{rolled over}} on his back--more slowly than usual, in {{consequence}} of his luncheon in the tent. He elevated his four paws {{in the air and}} looked lazily at Isabel out of his bright brown eyes. If ever a dog's look spoke yet, Tommie's look said, [...] "I have eaten too much; <b>rub</b> <b>my</b> stomach." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And then, sir," [...] said I, and <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> neck {{a little}} with my thumb, [...] "then I would be very desirous if you could slip in a word that might perhaps tell for my protection." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{it seemed}} to me, I had only been asleep {{for a few minutes}} when I was awakened by {{somebody}} calling me. I sat up and <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> eyes; it was broad daylight--eight o'clock, in fact.|$|R
2500|$|Diogenes {{is said to}} have masturbated in public, {{which was}} {{considered}} scandalous. On the indecency of him masturbating in public he would say, [...] "If only it were as easy to banish hunger by <b>rubbing</b> <b>my</b> belly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, bosh!" [...] said Bobby. [...] "I {{thought the}} man had gone out long ago - only - only I didn't care to take my hand away. <b>Rub</b> <b>my</b> arm down, there's a good chap. What a grip the brute has! I'm chilled to the marrow!" [...] He passed {{out of the tent}} shivering.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Ow {{can you be}} distantly civil {{when she}} lives just opposite?" [...] inquired the steward, querulously. [...] "She sent Teddy over at ten o'clock last night to <b>rub</b> <b>my</b> chest with a bottle o' liniment, and it's no good me saying I'm all right when she's been {{spending}} eighteen-pence o' good money over the stuff." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Father! Father!"

60|$|Out I {{started to}} thrust my head, but a sharp blow on the {{forehead}} caused me to recoil. I <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> bruised brow and gazed with reproachful inquiry at Paul, who was laughing in gleeful, boyish fashion.|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought I was <b>rubbing</b> <b>my</b> freckle lotion on it, but I {{must have}} used that red dye Marilla has for marking the pattern on her rugs," [...] was the despairing response. [...] "What shall I do?" ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> eyes, doubting {{whether we}} had not slept and dreamt these things by reason of the fungus we had eaten, and {{suddenly}} discovered the blood upon my face, and then that my shirt was sticking painfully to my shoulder and arm.|$|R
