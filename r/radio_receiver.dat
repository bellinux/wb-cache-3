5|$|Although {{provisionally}} {{assigned the}} designation U-7, the submarine was commissioned as SM U-12 on 21 August 1914, with Linienschiffsleutnant Egon Lerch in command.

5|$|Technological adaptations {{have also}} {{utilised}} living beetles as cyborgs.

5000|$|<b>Radio</b> <b>receivers</b> are {{essential}} components of all systems that use <b>radio.</b> Besides broadcast <b>receivers,</b> described above, <b>radio</b> <b>receivers</b> {{are used in}} a huge variety of electronic systems in modern technology. They can be a separate piece of equipment (a radio), or a subsystem incorporated into other electronic devices. A transceiver is a transmitter and receiver combined in one unit.

25|$|A {{superheterodyne}} receiver, often shortened to superhet, {{is a type}} of <b>radio</b> <b>receiver</b> {{that uses}} frequency mixing to convert a received signal to a fixed intermediate frequency (IF) which can be more conveniently processed than the original carrier frequency. It was invented by US engineer Edwin Armstrong in 1918 during World War I. Virtually all modern radio receivers use the superheterodyne principle.|$|E
25|$|The {{receiver}} {{is generally}} {{one of two}} types: a super-regenerative receiver or a superheterodyne. The super-regenerative receiver works like that of an intermittent oscillation detection circuit. The superheterodyne works {{like the one in}} a <b>radio</b> <b>receiver.</b> The superheterodyne receiver is used because of its stability, high sensitivity and it has relatively good anti-interference ability, a small package and lower price.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} use the N-V− centers is as a detector {{to measure the}} full mechanical stress tensor in {{the bulk of the}} crystal. For this application, the stress-induced splitting of the zero-phonon-line is exploited, and its polarization properties. A robust frequency-modulated <b>radio</b> <b>receiver</b> using the electron-spin-dependent photoluminescence that operated up to 350°C demonstrates the possibility for use in extreme conditions.|$|E

40|$|New {{emission}} limit requirements {{are needed to}} protect digital communication systems from radiated interference. Traditionally, standard emission requirements have focused on protecting analog amplitude modulated radio services. However, developments in digital technology require {{emission limit}} requirements adapted to protect digital radio communication services. The amplitude probability distribution (APD) of the envelope or the quadrature components of an interfering signal {{has been shown to}} be related to the bit error probability of some digital <b>radio</b> <b>receivers.</b> However, a general description of the APD of an interfering signal and its impact on digital coherent <b>radio</b> <b>receivers</b> has not been presented. The aim of this paper is to clarify this relationship for a larger group of digital <b>radio</b> <b>receivers.</b> A method of incorporating the APD in conventional error expressions developed for digital coherent <b>radio</b> <b>receivers</b> in additive white Gaussian noise is presented. Furthermore, the relation between the maximum error probability for different digital modulation schemes and the APD is described, which allows definition of emission requirements on the APD...|$|R
