50|$|<b>Reed</b> <b>valves</b> are {{a type of}} {{check valve}} which {{restrict}} the flow of fluids to a single direction, opening and closing under changing pressure on each face. Modern versions often consist of flexible metal or composite materials (fiberglass or carbon fiber).|$|R
50|$|The RD500LC (Race Developed 500CC Liquid Cooled motorcycle)uses a 50-degree, twin-crankshaft V4 engine layout. Linked Yamaha YPVS exhaust power valves are {{controlled}} by a single electronic unit and servo motor and are designed to give a broader power band. The engine also features intake <b>reed</b> <b>valves</b> unlike the YZR500 racer which used rotary disc <b>valve</b> induction. The <b>reed</b> <b>valves</b> use two different intake arrangements, the lower cylinders are fed through crankcase mounted reeds; the upper pair use cylinder barrel mounted reeds. The four Mikuni carburettors are side mounted in pairs and feed each cylinder through 90 degree intake manifold.The lower expansion chambers exit normally but the upper pipes cross over each other just behind the exhaust ports to maintain the correct tuned length.|$|R
50|$|<b>Reed</b> <b>valves</b> are {{commonly}} used in high-performance versions of the two-stroke engine, where they control the fuel-air mixture admitted to the cylinder. As the piston rises in the cylinder a vacuum is created in the crankcase beneath the piston. The resulting pressure differential opens the valve and the fuel-air mixture flows into the crankcase. As the piston descends, it raises the crankcase pressure causing the valve to close to retain the mixture and pressurize it for its eventual transfer through to the combustion chamber. The Swedish motorcycle company Husqvarna produced a two-stroke, 500 cc displacement single cylinder engine with a reed-valve controlled intake, {{one of the biggest}} in using this arrangement. <b>Reed</b> <b>valves</b> in two-stroke engines have been placed in the intake ports and also in controlling the intake to the crankshaft space.|$|R

50|$|Four-stroke {{engines are}} {{generally}} {{associated with a}} wider power band making for somewhat gentler power delivery, but technology such as <b>reed</b> <b>valves</b> and exhaust power-valve systems has improved ride-ability on two-strokes. Fuel economy is also better in four-strokes due to more complete combustion of the intake charge in four-stroke engines.|$|R
50|$|<b>Reed</b> <b>valves</b> are {{designed}} considering the pressure gradient and mass flow. The pressure gradient {{is used to}} evaluate the valve lift during open condition; the lift and overall component geometry (considering also a pressure loss coefficient) are then used to calculate the mass flow. For high speed applications (compressors and engines) the dynamic response has to be considered. A simple approach consists in the evaluation of first eigenvalue that is compared with exciting frequency.Design of <b>reed</b> <b>valves</b> can be refined using simulations. The dynamic of petals can be studied neglecting the coupling between fluid and structure: in this case the evolution of the structural part are simulated using lumped parameters models or FEM models, discharge coefficients at various valve lift are evaluated with experiments or CFD simulations.The study of the complete system needs an integrated Fluid-structure interaction model.|$|R
50|$|<b>Reed</b> <b>valves,</b> {{normally}} a leather flap covering a hole, are amongst the earliest form of automatic flow control for liquids and gases. They {{have been used}} for thousands of years in water pumps and for hundreds of years in bellows for high-temperature forges and musical instruments such as church organs and accordions. In nature, heart valves operate in a somewhat similar fashion.|$|R
5000|$|In a <b>reed</b> <b>valve</b> engine {{the valve}} is drawn open by suction as the piston moves upward on the {{compression}} stroke. As the piston moves {{down on the}} power stoke, the pressure in the crankcase causes the <b>reed</b> <b>valve</b> to close. The fuel air mixture in the crankcase is then forced past the piston via the transfer/bypass ports in the cylinder. One characteristic of a <b>reed</b> <b>valve</b> is that the engine will run in either direction; an advantage for a [...] "pusher" [...] model but a disadvantage if the engine is finger started, as it may start in the wrong direction. (The Cox engines employed a starting spring which kept fingers free of the propellor and generally ensured correct rotational direction.) ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Reed</b> <b>valves</b> are {{the most}} common type of valves used in small {{compressors}} due to their simplicity and low cost. Such valves greatly affect the compressor volumetric and isentropic efficiencies and their suitable design is also crucial for reliability, since they may be subjected to severe bending and impact stresses. This paper reports an optimization procedure for <b>reed</b> type <b>valves</b> considering efficiency and bending fatigue, which is attained by coupling a thermodynamic model for the compression cycle and a finite element model for the valve dynamics. Then, a genetic algorithm is adopted to find different valve geometries that give the best compromise between efficiency and reliability. As an example, the method is applied to optimize the suction valve of a small reciprocating compressor...|$|R

40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. Space {{pulse tube}} coolers are very efficient, {{but like all}} {{regenerative}} high frequency Stirling and pulse tube coolers, the cold head needs to be located near the compressor {{in order to minimize}} the input power to the cooler. For applications that require cooling some distance from the cooler or that require vibration isolation from the cooled object, the cooling can be effectively transferred with a fluid loop rather than with a higher mass conduction bar. This can greatly ease integration into a payload as well as readily transmit the cooling to multiple cooling points. In this paper we report on a proof of concept test in which we added cold <b>reed</b> <b>valves</b> to the pulse tube cold block of our flight proven high efficiency cooler (HEC) so that cold gas could be circulated without the need for an additional circulation pump and additional heat exchangers to cool the gas. In this test, the measured remote cooling and the parasitic heat loads were compared to our previously reported tests using warm <b>reed</b> <b>valves.</b> The two previous tests circulated gas from either a second circulator compressor or from the pulse tube compressor that also acted as a circulator and cooled the gas with a heat exchanger connected to the pulse tube cold head...|$|R
