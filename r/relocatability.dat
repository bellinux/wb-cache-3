40|$|The {{presentation}} examines {{common goals}} for human lunar exploration and strategic guidance. Three major sections include illustrative example goals, {{introduction to the}} GPoD campaign, and GPoD overview. The first section includes slides about strategic view of partnerships, the moon as a stepping stone and a uniquely preserved record, human-robotic partnership, innovative engagement, strategic considerations, and evaluation of campaigns against common goals. The second section examines campaigns considered, the philosophy of GPoD, GPoD campaign phase definitions, and GPoD design decision points. The third section examines lunar exploration capabilities, extended stay-relocation exploration mode, notional campaign destinations for GPoD, early robotics phase, development of the GPoD early robotics phase, polar exploration/system validation phase, polar <b>relocatability</b> phase, non-polar <b>relocatability</b> phase, long duration phase, and return to evaluation of campaigns...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a method that}} enhances the <b>relocatability</b> of partial bitstreams for FPGA run-time reconfiguration. Reconfigurable applications usually employ partial bitstreams which are specific to one target region on the FPGA. Previously, techniques have been proposed that allow relocation between identical regions on the FPGA. However, as FPGAs are becoming increasingly heterogeneous, this approach is often too restrictive. We introduce a method that circumvents the problem of having to find fully identical regions based on compatible subsets of resources, enabling flexible placement of relocatable modules. In a software defined radio prototype with two reconfigurable regions, the number of partial bitstreams is reduced by 50 % and the compile time is shortened by 43 %...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Distributed sensor {{networks}} offer {{many new}} capabilities for contextually monitoring environments. By making such systems mobile, we increase the application-space for the distributed network mainly by providing dynamic contextdependent deployment, continual <b>relocatability,</b> automatic node recovery, {{and a larger}} area of coverage. In existing models, the addition of actuation to the nodes has exacerbated three of the main problems with distributed systems: power usage, node size, and node complexity. In this {{paper we propose a}} solution to these problems in the form of parasitically actuated nodes that harvest their mobility and local navigational intelligence by selectively engaging and disengaging from mobile hosts in their environment. We analyze the performance of parasitically mobile distributed networks through software simulations and design, implement, and demonstrate hardware prototypes...|$|E
40|$|The field {{programmable}} {{gate array}} (FPGA) is an attractive computational platform for many applications because of its customizable nature and modest development cost, in terms of both time and money. As FPGAs scale to increased logical capacities, designers have increased flexibility. However, the FPGA placement problem becomes more difficult at increased sizes. Increasingly, designers are encouraged to structure designs hierarchically and floor-plan. Floor-planning is a manual process which maps specified design submodules to selected physical regions of the FPGA device fabric. This thesis explores several of the effects that floor-planning has on submodules and the designs they comprise. A method is developed to explore the floor-planning impact on submod-ules independent of a full design. Six different submodules are independently subjected to varying timing constraints and to area constraints of varying aspect ratios and area allocations. The result-ing submodule minimum clock periods, routing overflows, and <b>relocatabilities</b> are assembled from millions of submodule implementations. The aggregate results suggest that EDA placement and routing tools can meet design con...|$|R
40|$|Specific {{modifications}} in the Disk Operational System Unified Series {{to insure the}} <b>relocatability</b> of programs stored permanently in the core image library is described. A self-relocating method for loading programs into the working memory with re-editing all the programs recorded in the core image library is presented. The modified linkage editor can {{be included in a}} relocation dictionary containing data about each address constant at the assembly stage {{at the request of the}} programmer. The relocation dictionary increases the dimension of the RL-phase in comparison with the dimension of this same phase when edited by the standard method, making possible the creation of multiphase program complexes. Generation and use of the modified system using Assembly language is described. An example of the use of the system is given, and limitations of the use of the relocatable programs in the modified system are outlined...|$|E
40|$|Abstract â€” This paper {{describes}} {{a method of}} assessing the value of controllable devices such as Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) in a liberalized electricity market. A sophisticated algorithm using ac optimal power flow (OPF) is often unnecessarily detailed {{for the purpose of}} valuating such projects. Input parameters such as expected future generation mix is hard to guess and error prone. Therefore a simplified model of the underlying electricity system was chosen for this evaluation. The suggested method is based on a model that uses areaconstraints and aggregated generation in each area coupled with a double auction market model, based on the production costs of generators. A Discounted Cash Flow methodology is then used to estimate the value of this project. In different case studies the influence of various parameters on the value of the controllable device is determined. Typical parameters are: Investment costs, running costs, <b>relocatability</b> etc. Also the impact of transmission congestions on electricity prices, consumer, producer and society profit is studied...|$|E
40|$|Growing {{demand for}} {{computational}} performance, {{and the rising}} cost for chip design and manufacturing make reconfigurable hardware increasingly attractive for digital system implementation. Reconfigurable hardware, such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), can deliver performance through parallelism while also providing flexibility to enable application builders to reconfigure them. However, reconfigurable systems, particularly those involving run-time reconfiguration, are often developed in an ad-hoc manner. Such an approach usually results in low designer productivity {{and can lead to}} inefficient designs. This thesis covers three main achievements that address this situation. The first achievement is a model that captures design parameters of reconfigurable hardware and performance parameters of a given application domain. This model supports optimisations for several design metrics such as performance, area, and power consumption. The second achievement is a technique that enhances the <b>relocatability</b> of bitstreams for reconfigurable devices, taking into account heterogeneous resources. This method increases the flexibility of modules represented by these bitstreams while reducing configuration storage size and design compilation time. The third achievement is a technique to characterise the power consumption of FPGAs in different activity modes. This technique includes the evaluation of standby power and dedicated low-power modes, which are crucial in meeting the requirements for battery-based mobile devices.
