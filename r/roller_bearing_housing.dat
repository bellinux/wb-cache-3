50|$|A wire race bearing is a rolling-element bearing, {{where the}} balls or rollers run on races {{resembling}} loops of wire. <b>Roller</b> <b>bearings</b> may use just two races, but ball bearings typically use {{three or four}} races. Wire race bearings can be large yet lightweight and with small profile and good precision. Wire races have little intrinsic structure and must be adequately supported by the <b>bearing</b> <b>housing.</b> Balls, <b>rollers</b> or even cross rollers are used as rolling elements. Due to the design wire race bearings are commonly called '4-point-contact' bearings.|$|R

50|$|Tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> use conical <b>rollers</b> {{that run}} on conical races. Most <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> only take radial or axial loads, but tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> support both radial and axial loads, and {{generally}} can carry higher loads than ball bearings due to greater contact area. Tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are used, for example, as the wheel bearings of most wheeled land vehicles. The downsides to this bearing is that due to manufacturing complexities, tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are usually more expensive than ball bearings; and additionally under heavy loads the tapered roller is like a wedge and bearing loads tend to try to eject the roller; the force from the collar which keeps the <b>roller</b> in the <b>bearing</b> adds to bearing friction compared to ball bearings.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to numerically {{investigate}} one source of acoustic noise in <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> that which results from the motion of the <b>rollers</b> in the <b>bearing</b> under zero exter-nal load. For the sake of simplification, it was assumed that the cylindrical <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are infinitely long. Furthermore, the effects of the following on the noise of the bearing were also examined: the radial clearance of the bearing, the viscosity of the lubricant, and the number of rollers. The results of the study show that the fundamental frequency of the noise components of the cylindrical <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> corresponds to the multiplica-tion of the number of rollers and the whirling frequency of the roller center. The acoustical frequency spectra of the cylindrical <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> are pure tone spectra, containing the fundamental frequency of the <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> and its superharmonics. The fac-tors that decrease the sound pressure level of a cylindrical <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> include low lubricant viscosity, high radial clearance, and a reduced number of rollers.

40|$|A fault {{diagnosis}} approach for <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> based on improved intrinsic timescale decomposition de-noising and kriging-variable predictive model-based class discriminate Yu Yang 1, 2, Haiyang Pan 1, 2, Li Ma 1, 2 and Junsheng Cheng 1, 2 The measured vibration signal of <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> has noise signals, which will largely influence {{the accuracy of}} <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> {{fault diagnosis}}. This paper puts forward a vibration signal de-noising method based upon improved intrinsic timescale decomposition (ITD); fuzzy entropy is then extracted as the fault feature of the <b>roller</b> <b>bearing.</b> Essentially the fault diagnosis of <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> {{is a process of}} pattern recognition. Targeting the limitation of existing pattern recog-nition methods, a new pattern recognition method – variable predictive model-based class discriminate (VPMCD) – is introduced into <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> fault identification. In the original VPMCD classifier, however, only the regression model could be used to predict, which will reduce the prediction’s accuracy when the relation between features is complicated. Aimed at this defect, a kriging-variable predictive model-based class discriminate (KVPMCD) pattern recognition method is presented in this paper. The kriging model is composed of a regression model and a correlation model, of which the correlation model is a local deviation that is created {{on the basis of a}} global model, to make up for the shortcomings of the simple regression model in the original VPMCD. Therefore, a fault diagnosis approach for <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> based on improved ITD de-nosing and KVPMCD is proposed in this paper. The analysis results from experimental signals with normal and defective <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> indicate that the proposed fault diagnosis approach can accurately and effectively distinguish the status of <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> with or without fault and fault patterns.

In {{view of the fact}} that the nonload area is ubiquitous in cylindrical <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> there is a method for prolonging the fatigue life design by adjusting the working clearance of cylindrical <b>roller</b> <b>bearings.</b> In this article, optimization model of fatigue life of cylindrical <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> is developed with a quasi-dynamic method and calculated method of bearing life based on micro-area contact, considering the effect of assembly interference, temperature rise, and high-speed centrifugation.

50|$|CARB <b>bearings</b> are {{toroidal}} <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> {{and similar}} to spherical <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> but can accommodate both angular misalignment and also axial displacement. Compared to a spherical <b>roller</b> <b>bearing,</b> their {{radius of curvature}} is longer than a spherical radius would be, making them an intermediate form between spherical and cylindrical rollers. Their limitation is that, like a cylindrical roller, they do not locate axially. CARB bearings are typically used in pairs with a locating bearing, such as a spherical <b>roller</b> <b>bearing.</b> This non-locating bearing can be an advantage, {{as it can be}} used to allow a shaft and a housing to undergo thermal expansion independently.|$|R

40|$|<b>Roller</b> <b>bearing</b> plays a {{significant}} role in industrial sectors. To improve the ability of <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> fault diagnosis under multi-rotating situation, this paper proposes a novel <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> fault characteristic: the Amplitude Modulation (AM) based correntropy extracted from the Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), which are decomposed by Fast Ensemble Empirical mode decomposition (FEEMD) and employ Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) to implement intelligent fault identification. Firstly, the <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> vibration acceleration signal is decomposed by FEEMD to extract IMFs. Secondly, IMF correntropy matrix (IMFCM) as the fault feature matrix is calculated from the AM-correntropy model of the primary vibration signal and IMFs. Furthermore, depending on LSSVM, the fault identification results of the <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> are obtained. Through the bearing identification experiments in stationary rotating conditions, it was verified that IMFCM generates more stable and higher diagnosis accuracy than conventional fault features such as energy moment, fuzzy entropy, and spectral kurtosis. Additionally, it proves that IMFCM has more diagnosis robustness than conventional fault features under cross-mixed <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> operating conditions. The diagnosis accuracy was more than 84 % for the cross-mixed operating condition, which is much higher than the traditional features. In conclusion, it was proven that FEEMD-IMFCM-LSSVM is a reliable technology for <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> fault diagnosis under the constant or multi-positioned operating conditions, and as such, it possesses potential prospects for a broad application of uses...|$|R
