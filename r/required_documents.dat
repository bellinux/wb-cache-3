5|$|On 11 or 12 May 1941, {{a band of}} Ustaše led by Puk {{seized a}} group of Serb males from Glina and {{detained}} them regardless of occupation or class. The Ustaše then herded the group into an Orthodox Church and demanded that they be given documents proving the Serbs had all converted to Catholicism. Two Serbs produced the <b>required</b> <b>documents</b> and were released. The Ustaše then locked inside and massacred {{those who did not}} possess conversion certificates, including priest Bogdan Opačić. The bodies were then left to burn as the Ustaše set the church on fire and waited outside to shoot any survivors attempting to escape the flames. On 13 May, a further 100 Serb males were executed by the Ustaše in the nearby village of Prekopi.|$|E

2500|$|... "The {{relevant}} burdens {{here are}} those imposed on eligible voters who lack photo identification cards that comply with SEA 483. Because Indiana's cards are free, the inconvenience {{of going to}} the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, gathering <b>required</b> <b>documents,</b> and posing for a photograph does not qualify as a substantial burden on most voters' right to vote, or represent a significant increase over the usual burdens of voting. The severity of the somewhat heavier burden that may be placed on a limited number of persons—e.g., elderly persons born out-of-state, who may have difficulty obtaining a birth certificate—is mitigated by the fact that eligible voters without photo identification may cast provisional ballots that will be counted if they execute the required affidavit at the circuit court clerk’s office. Even assuming that the burden may not be justified as to a few voters, that conclusion is by no means sufficient to establish petitioners’ right to the relief they seek." ...|$|E
2500|$|U.S. {{federal law}} {{requires}} all aliens {{over the age}} of 14 who remain in the United States for longer than 30 days to register with the U.S. government. U.S. Federal law also requires aliens older than 18 to possess proper identification at all times; violation of this requirement is a federal misdemeanor crime. The Arizona act additionally made it a state misdemeanor crime for an alien to be in Arizona without carrying the <b>required</b> <b>documents,</b> required that state law enforcement officers attempt to determine an individual's immigration status during a [...] "lawful stop, detention or arrest", when there is reasonable suspicion that the individual is an illegal immigrant. The law barred state or local officials or agencies from restricting enforcement of federal immigration laws, and imposed penalties on those sheltering, hiring and transporting unregistered aliens. The paragraph on intent in the legislation says it embodies an [...] "attrition through enforcement" [...] doctrine.|$|E

This process was repeated until the user had provided enough information to allow the documents legally required to create the corporate entity to be generated. A number of document templates were also stored and the data processor was configured to merge {{at least one of these}} templates with the user's answers to generate the required legal documents. The documents could then be sent to the user in an electronic form for the user to print out and submit, mailed to the user, or submitted to the appropriate registration authority on behalf of the user.|$|E

The Act makes it a state misdemeanor crime for an alien to be in Arizona without carrying the <b>required</b> <b>documents</b> and obligates police to make an attempt, when practicable during a [...] "lawful stop, detention or arrest", to determine a person's immigration status if there is reasonable suspicion that the person is an illegal alien. [...] Any person arrested cannot be released without confirmation of the person's legal immigration status by the federal government pursuant to §1373(c) of Title 8 of the United States Code.
