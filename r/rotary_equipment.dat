Faults of these vital equipments can cause massive financial loss to the production plants which motivated the researchers to investigate and develop efficient fault diagnosis systems for this kind of <b>rotary</b> <b>equipments</b> [1, 2]. Numerous fault diagnosis methods for induction motors have been proposed so far which can be classified in three main types depending on their diagnosis procedure [1], namely model based, signal based, and data based. However, signal processing is a crucial part for all of these three types but with a different impact and role. The most popular signal processing techniques include time domain analysis, frequency domain techniques like spectral analysis, and time-frequency domain methods such as short-time Fourier transform (STFT) or wavelet analysis. The main purpose of signal processing step in a fault diagnosis system is to reveal the fault signatures from the measured quantities which is a difficult task in the presence of background noise.|$|R

Car dumper is an {{important}} material transport equipment which has characteristics such as large structure, heavy duty, low frequency operation, stop-and-go and recurrent excursion of machine barycenter. This paper researched implementation of synchronization control. A fuzzy controller is added between two channels of dual drive subsystem. Based on coordinated control principle and achieving the goal of difference minimum of corresponding state of two subsystem, a fuzzy correction control program using in-phase error non-uniform common feedback is adopted to make the output of two synchronous subsystem consistent basically, which increase response speed of system to synchronous error, reduce synchronous error of dual drive subsystems effectively, ensure the consistency of car dumper dual drive, solve the recurrent mechanical failure caused by inconsistency of dual drive and enhance the steady reliable operation of car dumpers.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors that affect the pointing of precision payloads and devices in space platforms is the vibration generated due to static and dynamic unbalanced forces of <b>rotary</b> <b>equipments</b> placed in the neighborhood of payload. Generally, such disturbances are of low amplitude, less than 1 kHz, and are termed as ‘micro-vibrations’. Due to low damping in the space structure, these vibrations have long decay time and they degrade the performance of payload. This paper addresses the design, modeling and analysis of a low frequency space frame platform for passive and active attenuation of micro-vibrations. This flexible platform has been designed to act as a mount for devices like reaction wheels, and consists of four folded continuous beams arranged in three dimensions. Frequency and response analysis have been carried out by varying the number of folds, and thickness of vertical beam. Results show that lower frequencies can be achieved by increasing the number of folds and by decreasing the thickness of the blade.

A {{major part of the}} energy used in any production process is expended during the maintenance of the employed equipment. To ensure plant reliability and equipment availability, a condition-based maintenance policy has been developed in this investigation. In particular, this project explored the use of vibration parameters in the diagnosis of equipment failure. A computer-based diagnostic tool employing an artificial neural-network (ANN) was developed to analyse the ensuing machinery faults, their causes and consequences. For various categories of this type of machinery, a vibration-severity chart (ISO 12372 / BS 4675 : 1971) appropriately colour coded according to defined mechanical faults, was used in training of the ANN. The model was validated using data obtained from a centrifugal pump on full load and fed into the program written in Visual Basic. The results revealed that, for centrifugal pumps within 15 to 300 kw power range, vibration-velocity amplitude of between 0. 9 and 2. 7 mm/s was within acceptable limits. When the values rose to between 2. 8 and 7. 0 mm/s, closer monitoring and improved understanding of the equipment condition was needed.

For example, scalability restrictions, the necessity for high lift installations offshore requiring specialist vessels, high gravitational and aerodynamic moments on the support structure and a need to maintain <b>rotary</b> <b>equipment</b> at heights typically over 60 – 80 m. Conversely, vertical axis {{wind turbines}} have several inherent attributes that offer some advantages for offshore operations, particularly their scalability and low over-turning moments with better accessibility to drivetrain components.

The Aerogenerator vertical axis wind turbine is self-supporting so does not require a supporting tower, giving a low centre of gravity and producing significantly lower aerodynamic over-turning moments than conventional vertical axis wind turbines or horizontal axis wind turbines, making it a credible option for a floating, deep water platform. A numerical optimisation procedure is described to minimise the Aerogenerator weight while imposing aerodynamic, mechanical and structural side constraints. The study proposes a novel ‘sycamore’-shaped rotor design that demonstrates a lower cost of energy compared with conventional offshore turbines...|$|E

This thesis is based on the hypothesis that the Phase-Shifted Full Bridge (PSFB) topology can efectively utilise the parasitic components of the rotating transformer to achieve efficient (over 90 %) power conversion at the kW range. The first part of this work concentrates on the study of the magnetic interface and its electrical properties. Initially the magnetic structure of the transformer is studied in order to gain understanding {{of the effects of the}} physical layout of the component to its electrical behaviour. The problems of low magnetising and increased leakage inductance are quantified by measurements, calculations and finite element analysis. An accurate electrical model is built and used to calculate the transformer voltage and current gain. The second part of the research programme aims at the compilation of a design strategy for a PSFB incorporating a rotating transformer. An algorithm is presented, that optimises the magnetic component structure in order to achieve minimum switching losses and spread the conduction losses between the transformer and power switches. The last stage involves the evaluation of the design algorithm through prototyping and testing. Some topological variations are tested and compared with the original conventional PSFB converter.

The solid distribution in the drum affects the amount of contact surface between the solid and the gas. The retention time of solids influences the time particles can stay in contact with the gas in order to transfer heat and mass. Any heat and mass transfer model for a {{solid particle}} dryer must be able to predict solid flowrate and solid hold-up. There have been several reports in the literature regarding the modelling aspects of solid transport in dryers.

This paper addresses solid motion modelling and the effects of different variables involved in solid transport phenomena. Sugar drying process is the case study in this work. A steady state semi-empirical model was modified to predict solid hold-up and flowrate in rotary dryers. This model was incorporated into a heat and mass transfer model to predict solid moisture and temperature for inferential and model-based control purposes. Results of several experiments that have been used to investigate dynamics of the system in terms of solid motion and to validate the model are also presented.

The samples for the analyses came from known areas with fibrous minerals, e. g. Lauria (Basilicata), and less known areas, e. g. the Natural Reserve of Mt. Rufeno (Latium) and Biancavilla (Sicily). With this methodology, fibres may be directly detected in both farmed and unfarmed soil with fibrous minerals and the process may be repeated in the various stages of farming or during works for creation of fire barriers or lanes, hydrogeological restoration etc. The goal is to identify risks arising from the natural occurrence of asbestos upon atypical activities, such as farming and forestry.

Our preliminary work describes the technology to separate pig slurry solids and the subsequent incomplete (90 -day) co-composting with locally available agricultural wastes as absorbent materials.
