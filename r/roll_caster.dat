40|$|Purpose: In {{the present}} study, {{effectiveness}} of a high-speed twin <b>roll</b> <b>caster</b> for recycling aluminum alloy was investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The effects of the high-speed twin <b>roll</b> <b>caster</b> on alleviating the deterioration of mechanical properties by impurities were investigated. Properties of the cast strip were investigated by metalography, a tension test, and a bending test. Findings: A vertical type twin <b>roll</b> <b>caster</b> for strip casting of aluminum alloys was devised. The strip, which was thinner than 3 mm, could be cast at speeds higher than 60 m/min. Features of the twin roll casters are as below. Copper rolls were used and lubricant was not used {{in order to increase}} the casting speed. A casting nozzle was used to set the solidification length precisely. Heat transfer between melt and the roll was improved by hydrostatic pressure of the melt. Separating force was very small in order to prevent sticking of the strip to the roll. Low superheat casting was carried out in order to improve microstructure of the strip. In the present study, {{effectiveness of a}} high-speed and high-cooling rate twin <b>roll</b> <b>caster</b> of the present study for recycling aluminum alloy was investigated.

40|$|Abstract. A single <b>roll</b> <b>caster</b> {{equipped}} with a scraper was devised to cast the strip with sound free solidified surface. A property of this single caster is equipment of the scraper. Semisolid metal on the free solidified surface was scribed by a scraper and the surface became flat. Center line segregation did not occur as the strip was solidified from single side. The AA 5182 aluminum alloy could be cast at speeds up to 40 m/min. Thickness was about 3 mm. Pressure of the unit width from the scraper was ranging from 0. 1 N/mm to 1. 0 N/mm, and these pressure {{was enough to make}} the free solidified surface flat. Roll cast strip could be cold rolled down to 1 mm. There was not difference between roll contact surface and the free solidified surface after cold rolling by a visual examination. Result of tension test of the roll cast strip was as same as that of D. C. cast and rolled strip. Deep drawing test was operated at the conditions both of the roll contact surface and the free solidified surface was outside. LDR (limited drawing ratio) was same at both conditions and they were 1. 8. Thickness of the strip was controlled by the roll speed, solidification length (length of the melt pool) and pressure of the scraper. The single <b>roll</b> <b>caster</b> is simpler than a twin <b>roll</b> <b>caster.</b> Rigidity for rolling was not needed for the single <b>roll</b> <b>caster.</b> Cost of the roll is half comparing a twin <b>roll</b> <b>caster.</b> The equipment cost of the single <b>roll</b> <b>caster</b> is more economy than that of the twin <b>roll</b> <b>caster...</b>|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Of {{this paper}} is to realize the casting of the clad strip by only one process. Therefore, the {{investigation}} of the ability of the casting of the clad strip by a vertical type twin <b>roll</b> <b>caster</b> was operated. The aim of the use of the twin <b>roll</b> <b>caster</b> to make clad strip was in the reduction of the production-energy of the clad strip. Design/methodology/approach: Used {{in the present study was}} a vertical type twin <b>roll</b> <b>caster</b> with the scriber. The scriber was used to prevent the mixture of the two kinds of the melts. The scriber was set at roll-bite, and the scriber contacted to the one of solidification layer. The melt was stopped by the scriber and the only the solidification layer was dragged by the roll. Findings: The clad strip with the clear interface could be by the vertical type twin <b>roll</b> <b>caster</b> with the scriber. The scriber was useful to drag only the solid and semisolid layer. The two kinds of strips were connected strictly at the interface of the clad strip. The clad strip was not broken at the interface by the continuous bending.

40|$|Purpose: A Purpose of {{the present}} study was to break through the {{disadvantage}} of the twin <b>roll</b> <b>caster</b> for aluminum alloy. They were slow casting speed and limitation of alloy. For example, the casting speed was slower than 5 m/min, and casting of hypereutectic Al-Si alloy was difficult. In order to break through the disadvantages, semisolid casting using an unequal diameter twin <b>roll</b> <b>caster</b> was tested its ability. Design/methodology/approach: The specification of the unequal diameter twin <b>roll</b> <b>caster</b> is as below. The diameter of the upper roll was 250 mm, and that of the lower roll was 1000 mm. The width of the roll was 100 mm. The semisolid slurry was made by a cooling slope. Findings: The microstructure of the strip became very fine. Especially, primary and eutectic Si became very fine. This was the effect of rapid solidification. As the result, the ductility of Al- 16 %Si was improved. Research limitations/implications: 6111 aluminum alloy strip was cast at speeds of 5, 10 and 20 m/min. This caster could cast the strip at the speeds higher than the conventional twin <b>roll</b> <b>caster.</b> Start of casting was very easy. The hypereutectic Al- 16 %Si alloy, which has wide freezing zone, could be cast in to the strip by the unequal diameter twin <b>roll</b> <b>caster.</b> This was the effect of the cooling of the strip on the lower roll.

40|$|Abstract. The {{disadvantages}} {{of the conventional}} twin-roll caster for aluminum alloy are low casting speeds and limited choices of alloys that are castable by this processing. It is known that strip casting of aluminum alloy 5182 is very difficult because of their wider freezing zones. The vertical-type high-speed twin-roll caster {{used in the present}} study was devised to overcome these disadvantages. Features of the high speed twin roll casters are as below. Mild steel rolls were used in order to increase the casting speed and to be made at a lower equipment cost. Roll coating is produced in casting of Al-Mg alloy. Therefore lubricant, that resists heat transfer, was not {{used in the present study}}. Heat transfer between melt and the roll was improved by hydrostatic pressure of the melt. Low superheat casting was carried out in order to improve microstructure of the strip. In the present study, effectiveness of a high-speed twin <b>roll</b> <b>caster</b> for recycling aluminum alloy was investigated.

The cooling rate of the strip was ranging from 2000 OC/s at the surface to 1000 OC/s {{at the center of}} the thickness. The eutectic Si was smaller than 2 µm. The homogenization, cold rolling down to 1 mm, and annealing were carried out before tension tests, 180 degrees bending tests and deep drawing tests. The tensile stress was 192 MPa, the 0. 2 % proof stress was 84 MPa, and the elongation was 23. 8 %. Roll cast Al- 11 %Si had excellent elongation. The specimen was not broken by the 180 degree bending. LDR (Limiting Drawing Ratio) of the deep drawing test was 1. 8. The ductility was drastically improved by the high speed twin <b>roll</b> <b>caster.</b> These results show that roll cast Al- 11 %Si has ability to be used for the sheet forming. Moreover, the Fe content was increased up to 1. 0 % as a model of a recycled alloy. The elongation was 15. 9 % and the LDR was 1. 7.

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is to clear the {{possibility}} of high speed roll casting of thin strips of two aluminum alloys: 6061 and recycled 6061. Mechanical properties of the roll cast 6061 and recycled 6061 strips were investigated inthe frame of this purpose. Design/methodology/approach: Methods used in the present study were high speed twin <b>roll</b> <b>caster</b> and lowtemperature casting. These methods were used to realize rapid solidification and increase the casting speed. Findings: are that 6061 and recycled 6061 could be cast at speed of 60 m/min.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the work is to {{establish}} a manufacturing process and technology to facilitate theeconomical manufacture of high-quality magnesium sheet alloys with high aluminum contents, such as AZ 61 and AZ 91. The aim {{of the work is}} to establish a twin roll casting technology to facilitate the manufacture ofAZ 61 and AZ 91 magnesium sheet alloys economically whilst maintaining high quality. Design/methodology/approach: A horizontal type twin <b>roll</b> <b>caster</b> was used to manufacture thin magnesium alloysheets of AZ 61 and AZ 91. Pair of copper alloy roll and pure copper roll was used for the horizontal type twin <b>roll</b> <b>caster.</b> A closed type tundish was set to the <b>roll</b> <b>caster</b> to keep stable contact of molten magnesium with upper and lower rolls. Findings: The experiment results clarified that AZ 61 and AZ 91 sheets can be manufactured by twin roll castingprocess. The product sheet thickness in the present experiment is 2. 0 to 4. 5 mm for AZ 91, 2. 5 to 5. 0 mm forAZ 61. Mill stiffness and a method of predicting the cast sheet’s thickness were investigated to determine theappropriate manufacturing conditions. The microstructure of AZ 61 cast strips was equiaxed structure and thecrystal sizes are different depending on cross section observed. The dendric and equiaxed microstructure wereseen in the microstructure of AZ 91 cross section. The intermetllic Mg 17 Al 12 was seen in the grain boundary inAZ 91 when roll speed was very slow. The grain size of the manufactured wrought magnesium alloys sheet wasless than 10 micrometers. The obtained magnesium alloy sheet exhibited an equivalent limiting drawing ratio ina warm-drawing test. The limiting drawing ratio of AZ 61 was 2. 6 and 2. 4 for AZ 91. Research limitations/implications: The suitable roll speed was from 9 m/min to 15 m/min in manufacturingAZ 91 and AZ 61 strip using copper alloy rolls. When in use of pure copper roll, strips were cast between 6 m/minand 20 m/min for manufacturing AZ 61 and AZ 91. The superheats in the experiment were 15 ºC and 30 ºC.

40|$|Aluminum {{sheets are}} {{currently}} {{produced by the}} direct-chill process (DC). The need for low-cost aluminum sheets is a challenge {{for the development of}} new materials produced by the twin <b>roll</b> <b>caster</b> (TRC) process. It is expected that sheets produced from these different casting procedures will differ in their microstructure. These differences in microstructure and in the crystallographic texture have great impact on sheet mechanical properties and formability. The present study investigated microstructure and evaluated texture of two strips of Al-Mn-Fe-Si (3003) aluminum alloy produced by TRC and by hot-rolling processes. It was possible to notice that the microstructure, morphology, and grain size of the TRC sample were more homogenous than those found in hot-rolled samples. Both strips, obtained by the two processes, showed strong texture gradient across the thickness.
