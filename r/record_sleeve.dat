500|$|... "Everybody" [...] was commercially {{released}} as Madonna's first single in October 6, 1982, and {{came with a}} Lou Beach-designed sleeve depicting a hip hop–style NYC street scene. Because of the ambiguous nature of the <b>record</b> <b>sleeve</b> and the R groove of the song, Madonna was widely {{believed to be a}} black artist when the single was released. According to Matthew Lindsay of The Quietus, it was ironic that the <b>record</b> <b>sleeve</b> did not depict Madonna on the cover, as she would become [...] "the face of the 80s." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{interior}} artwork, {{presented in}} a booklet on the CD version of the album and on the <b>record</b> <b>sleeve</b> on vinyl releases, features an assemblage of scribbled and typewritten lyrics, personal [...] "thank you" [...] notes, cutouts of Catholic and Renaissance artwork, as well as childlike drawings and storybook pictures juxtaposed with photos of women in bondage. In a 2003 article published in The Stranger, the album liner notes were likened to [...] "the scrapbook of an incest victim." [...] In the liner notes, the album is dedicated to Rob Ritter of the LA punk group Bags.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{version of}} [...] "This Charming Man" [...] was recorded on 14 September 1983, in Maida Vale Studio 4, for John Peel's radio programme (first broadcast: 21 September 1983). Produced by Roger Pusey, and assisted by Ted De Bono, {{this version of}} the song was first included on the 1984 compilation Hatful of Hollow. On 28 October 1983, the [...] "Manchester" [...] version was released in the UK in 7" [...] and 12" [...] formats, reaching number 25 in the UK charts. The <b>record</b> <b>sleeve</b> uses a still frame from Jean Cocteau's 1949 film Orphée, featuring French actor Jean Marais. The song was later included as a bonus track on the cassette version of the band's debut album The Smiths in the UK, and subsequently on all American versions.|$|E

500|$|Lynott's second solo album, The Philip Lynott Album, {{was delayed}} until 1982 while Renegade was {{completed}} and released in November 1981. Renegade was not successful, only reaching no. 38 in the UK and no. 157 in the US. A single, [...] "Hollywood (Down on Your Luck)", also flopped, {{although it did}} reach no. 24 on the US Mainstream Rock chart. Despite only two songs from the album being written solely by Lynott, {{and other members of}} the band contributing more to the compositions, both Gorham and Wharton have since stated their dissatisfaction with some of the songs, such as [...] "Angel of Death", [...] "Fats" [...] and [...] "Mexican Blood". Wharton was omitted from the band photos on the back of the <b>record</b> <b>sleeve,</b> despite the fact that he was by this time a permanent member of the band. [...] "It hurt me a great deal", he later said.|$|E
500|$|Research by rock {{historian}} Bob Egan {{suggests the}} location of the cover photo was at 375 West Street, at the extreme west of Greenwich Village. The original inside gatefold featured nine black-and-white photos, all taken by Schatzberg and selected for the sleeve by Dylan himself. A shot of actress Claudia Cardinale from Schatzberg's portfolio was included but later withdrawn because it had been used without her authorization and Cardinale's representatives threatened to sue, making the original <b>record</b> <b>sleeve</b> a collector's item. Dylan included a self-portrait by Schatzberg as a credit to the photographer. The photos, for Gill, added up to [...] "a shadowy glimpse of [...] life, including an enigmatic posed shot of Dylan holding a small portrait of a woman {{in one hand and a}} pair of pliers in the other: they all contributed to the album's air of reclusive yet sybaritic genius." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{sessions}} {{took place}} partly at Apple Studio in London, but mostly at Harrison's home studio, FPSHOT, according to Voormann. Apple Studio, together with its Savile Row, London W1 address, {{would receive a}} prominent credit on the Living in the Material World <b>record</b> <b>sleeve,</b> as a further sign of Harrison's championing of the Beatles-owned recording facility. At the weekends during these autumn months, Hopkins recorded his own solo album, The Tin Man Was a Dreamer (1973), at Apple, with contributions from Harrison, Voormann and Horn. Voormann has described the mood at the Friar Park sessions as [...] "intimate, quiet, friendly" [...] and {{in stark contrast to}} the sessions he, Harrison and Hopkins had attended at Lennon's home in 1971, for the Imagine album. Keltner recalls Harrison as having been focused and [...] "at his peak physically" [...] throughout the recording of Living in the Material World, having given up smoking and taken to using Hindu prayer beads.|$|E

500|$|Radiohead {{announced}} The King of Limbs {{on their}} website on 14 February 2011 with a release date of 19 February. It was released one day earlier, on 18 February. The download of The King of Limbs is DRM-free. The MP3 download costs £6, US$9, or €7; the WAV download costs £9, US$14, or €11. Customers could also order a special [...] "newspaper edition" [...] of the album, released 9 May 2011, for £30, US$48 or €36 with the MP3 download, and £33, US$53 or €39 with the WAV download (shipping included). The [...] "newspaper" [...] edition contains [...] "two 10-inch vinyl records {{in a special}} <b>record</b> <b>sleeve,</b> many large sheets of artwork, 625 tiny pieces of artwork, a compact disc, and a colour piece of oxo-degradable plastic package". The retail CD and vinyl editions of The King of Limbs were released through the band's Ticker Tape imprint on XL in the United Kingdom, TBD in the United States, and Hostess Entertainment in Japan.|$|E
500|$|After {{a year in}} existence, {{the band}} had earned a total of $600. They now faced two options: divide the money among the members, or press the {{recordings}} they had made with Zientara at Inner Ear. Choosing the latter, Nelson, Strejcek and MacKaye formed Dischord Records with Groff's help, to release the recordings. The band sent the tapes to a pressing plant in Nashville, Tennessee that specialized in pressing country music records. Initially puzzled by the request to put eight songs on a 7" [...] record, they pressed 1,000 copies. For the cover, the band took apart another 7" [...] <b>record</b> <b>sleeve</b> and {{used it as a}} template for their own cover design. They photocopied it on 11" [...] × 17" [...] paper, which the band members cut out with scissors, folded and glued by hand, then into these inserted the records and lyric sheets. Released in December 1980, Minor Disturbance was a local success, receiving radio airplay and reviews from fanzines such as Touch and Go, which meant that Dischord now had enough money to release records by other bands.|$|E
500|$|Albini's name {{does not}} appear on the {{original}} <b>record</b> <b>sleeve.</b> The booklet's photographs were taken in {{one day at a}} pub opposite the 4AD offices, because, according to Larbalestier, [...] "it {{was one of the few}} places that had a raised stage". In an 1988 interview with Joy Press, Black Francis described the concept as referring to [...] "a surfer girl," [...] who [...] "walks along the Beach of Binones, has a surfboard, very beautiful." [...] When questioned about the topless element, he replied, [...] "For the first record, I told them I liked nudity. I like body lines—not necessarily something in bad taste, didn't even have to be female, just body lines... like that Obsession ad, you know?" [...] According to Melody Maker, the album was originally entitled [...] "Gigantic" [...] after Deal's song, but the band feared misinterpretation of the cover and changed it to [...] "Surfer Rosa." [...] The [...] "name" [...] of the cover woman, and the album title, comes from the [...] "Oh My Golly!" [...] lyric, [...] "Besando chichando con surfer rosa." ...|$|E

500|$|For {{the album}} cover, Barrett painted {{the floor of}} his bedroom in Wetherby Mansions orange and purple. The nude woman {{appearing}} {{on the back of the}} <b>record</b> <b>sleeve</b> was an acquaintance of his known as [...] "Iggy the Eskimo". Photographer Mick Rock says, [...] "When I arrived for 'The Madcap Laughs' photo session, Syd was still in his underpants [...]. His lady friend of two weeks, 'Iggy the Eskimo', was naked in the kitchen [...]." [...] Iggy met Barrett in March 1969, through Barrett's then-girlfriend, Jenny Spires. Barrett had moved into Wetherby Mansions, and Jenny took Iggy there one evening. Iggy stayed on at the flat when Jenny left for The States a couple of weeks later. Iggy didn't know who Barrett was or that he was previously in Pink Floyd. Iggy heard Barrett play several songs that would later appear on the album, one being [...] "Terrapin", which she called [...] "quite catchy". In October 2010 she was interviewed, revealing that her name was Evelyn. The album was designed by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. The original sleeve featured no musician credits, barring producer credit; later issues contain musician credits. On the original release, track 10 is listed as [...] "She Took a Long Cold Look", although on the 2010 remaster the track is re-titled to [...] "She Took a Long Cool Look", in similar vein to An Introduction to Syd Barrett.|$|E
500|$|While Creation {{were pleased}} with the final album, and the initial music press reviews were positive, the label soon {{realised}} that although, {{in the words of}} plugger James Kyllo, [...] "it was such a beautiful record, and it was wonderful to have it... it just didn't sound like a record that was going to recoup all the money that had been spent on it." [...] Alan McGee liked the record, but admitted, [...] "It was quite clear that we couldn't bear the idea of going through that again, because there was just nothing to say that [...] wouldn't do exactly the same again. That's enough. Lets step back". Despite a severe shortage of money, Creation funded a short tour of the north of England late in 1991. At the time the band were making the marketing of Loveless difficult—there would be no singles, and the band's name was forbidden to appear on the <b>record</b> <b>sleeve.</b> McGee was by now exhausted and frustrated. He recalled, [...] "I thought: I went to the wall for you. If this record bombs, I've stolen my father's money. And they were so...not understanding of anybody else's position." [...] McGee dropped My Bloody Valentine from Creation soon after the album's release because he could not bear working with Shields again; [...] "It was either him or me", he told The Guardian in 2004. Loveless peaked at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart, and failed to chart in the United States, where it was distributed by Sire Records. In 2003 Rolling Stone estimated the sales figures for Loveless as 225,000 copies sold.|$|E

2500|$|The Human League often added cryptic {{references}} to their productions and the <b>record</b> <b>sleeve</b> of [...] "Don't You Want Me" [...] featured the suffix of [...] "100". This was {{a reference to}} The 100 Club, a restaurant/bar in Sheffield.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 January 1984, BBC Radio 1 {{disc jockey}} Mike Read {{was playing the}} record on his show when he noticed the front cover design (by Yvonne Gilbert). Read {{apparently}} became outraged by the [...] "overtly sexual" [...] nature of both the <b>record</b> <b>sleeve</b> and the printed lyrics, which prompted him to remove the disc from the turntable live on air, branding it [...] "obscene".|$|E
50|$|A silk cloth bound {{hard board}} slipcase {{contains}} a hardback book with seven <b>record</b> <b>sleeves.</b> Six of these house heavyweight 180-gram vinyl records pressed on the EMI 1400.

The seventh sleeve contains an oversized foldout sheet music print, signed by Tennant and Lowe.
