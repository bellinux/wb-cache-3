5|$|The {{consensus}} view {{in contemporary}} palaeontology {{is that the}} flying theropods, or avialans, are the closest relatives of the deinonychosaurs, which include dromaeosaurids and troodontids. Together, these form a group called Paraves. Some basal members of this group, such as Microraptor, have features which may have enabled them to glide or fly. The most basal deinonychosaurs were very small. This evidence <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> that the ancestor of all paravians may have been arboreal, {{have been able to}} glide, or both. Unlike Archaeopteryx and the non-avialan feathered dinosaurs, who primarily ate meat, recent studies suggest that the first avialans were omnivores.|$|E
5|$|In January 2008 the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) scientists, Hugh Corr and David Vaughan, {{reported}} that 2,200years ago a volcano erupted under the Antarctic ice sheet. This {{was the biggest}} Antarctic eruption in the last 10,000years. The volcano is situated in the Hudson Mountains, close to Pine Island Glacier. The eruption spread a layer of volcanic ash (or tephra) {{over the surface of}} the ice sheet. This ash was then buried under the snow and ice. Corr and Vaughan were able to map this ash layer using an airborne radar system and calculate the date of the eruption from the depth of burial of the ash. This method uses dates calculated from nearby ice cores. The presence of the volcano <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> that volcanic activity could have contributed, or may contribute in the future, to increases in the flow of the glacier.|$|E

5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but {{it may have been}} Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. Only the role of Marie Eline is cited by Bowers, but a surviving film still <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of identifying several more actors in the production. Bowers states that most of the credits are fragmentary for 1910 Thanhouser productions.|$|E
5|$|Banksia prionotes × hookeriana {{has also}} been {{verified}} as occurring in the wild, but only in disturbed locations. The two parent species have overlapping ranges and are pollinated by the same honeyeater species; and though preferring different soils, they often occur near enough {{to each other for}} pollinators to move between them. It therefore appears that the only barrier to hybridisation in undisturbed areas is the different flowering seasons: B.prionotes has usually finished flowering by the end of May, whereas flowering of B.hookeriana usually does not begin until June. In disturbed areas, however, the increased runoff and reduced competition mean extra nutrients are available, and this results in larger plants with more flowers and a longer flowering season. Thus the flowering seasons overlap, and the sole barrier to interbreeding is removed. The resultant F1 hybrids are fully fertile, with seed production rates {{similar to that of the}} parent species. There is no barrier to backcrossing of hybrids with parent species, and in some populations this has resulted in hybrid swarms. This <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of the parent species gradually losing their genetic integrity, especially if the intermediate characteristics of the hybrid offer it a competitive advantage over the parent species, such as a wider habitat tolerance. Moreover, speciation might occur if the hybrid's intermediate characteristics allow it to occupy a habitat unsuited to both parents, such as an intermediate soil type.|$|E
25|$|Until very recently, no one {{had ever}} {{documented}} the presence of nociceptors (the cells that detect and transmit sensations of pain) in insects, though recent findings of nociception in larval fruit flies challenges this and <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> that some insects may be capable of feeling pain.|$|E

25|$|While tetrachromatic {{vision is}} not {{exclusive}} to birds (insects, reptiles, and crustaceans are also sensitive to short wavelengths), some predators of UVS birds cannot see ultraviolet light.

However, recent evidence does not appear to support this hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|Thunderstorms {{can produce}} a brief pulse of gamma {{radiation}} called a terrestrial gamma-ray flash. These gamma rays {{are thought to be}} produced by high intensity static electric fields accelerating electrons, which then produce gamma rays by bremsstrahlung as they collide with and are slowed by atoms in the atmosphere. Gamma rays up to 100 MeV can be emitted by terrestrial thunderstorms, and were discovered by space-borne observatories. This <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of health risks to passengers and crew on aircraft flying in or near thunderclouds.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} this {{extremely}} small size limit of 0.01µm {{is because of the}} consideration of Gene Transfer Agents (GTAs). These randomly incorporate segments of the host genome and can transfer them to other evolutionarily distant hosts, and do that without killing the new host. In this way many archaea and bacteria can swap DNA with each other. This <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> that Martian life, if it has a common origin with Earth life in the distant past, could swap DNA with Earth micro-organisms in the same way.|$|E

25|$|Currently, {{research}} {{is focusing on}} genetics of silkworms {{and the possibility of}} genetic engineering. Many hundreds of strains are maintained, and over 400 Mendelian mutations have been described. Another source suggests 1,000 inbred domesticated strains are kept worldwide. One useful development for the silk industry is silkworms that can feed on food other than mulberry leaves, including an artificial diet. Research on the genome also <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of genetically engineering silkworms to produce proteins, including pharmacological drugs, in the place of silk proteins. Bombyx mori females are also one of the few organisms with homologous chromosomes held together only by the synaptonemal complex (and not crossovers) during meiosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of planets orbiting other star systems, including similar binary systems (Gamma Cephei), <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> that additional planets may {{exist in the}} Alpha Centauri system. Such planets could orbit Alpha CentauriA or Alpha CentauriB individually, or be on large orbits around the binary Alpha Centauri AB. Because both the principal stars are fairly similar to the Sun (for example, in age and metallicity), astronomers have been especially interested in making detailed searches for planets in the Alpha Centauri system. Several established planet-hunting teams have used various radial velocity or star transit methods in their searches around these two bright stars. All the observational studies have so far failed to find any evidence for brown dwarfs or gas giants.|$|E
25|$|Both {{participants}} {{are currently in}} the NL Central, due to {{the transfer of the}} Brewers from the American League to the National League in 1998. This <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of the Brewers eventually representing two different leagues in World Series competition. That has happened twice before, taking the 19th Century contests into account: The Brooklyn Dodgers of 1889 and 1890, and the Cardinals, who won the 1886 Series when they were in the American Association. This also makes this one of two World Series in the modern era (1903–present) that {{it is not possible to}} have a rematch, the other being the 2005 World Series between the Chicago White Sox and the Houston Astros, due to the Astros moving to the American League for 2013.|$|E

It did not change the test against which net capital was measured. That test had never directly limited overall leverage of either a broker-dealer or its parent holding company.|$|R
25|$|Identity synergy principle: The {{fact that}} the {{personal}} and social selves can be activated independently <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> that they may combine synergistically to motivate pro-group behavior. Consistent with this possibility, {{studies have shown that}} the activation of either the personal self or social self amplifies the willingness of strongly fused persons to behave in a pro-group fashion. For example, activating the personal self by ostracizing participants from the group based on their personal preferences, or activating the social self by ostracizing participants based on their group membership, resulted in the amplification of endorsement of pro-group action for strongly, but not weakly, fused individuals. Thus, unlike social identity theory which assumes that the personal self does not play a role in pro-group behavior, fusion theory holds that pro-group behaviors are motivated by both the personal and social selves and these two types of self-knowledge may sometimes work together.|$|E
25|$|In 1860, Boston {{businessman}} and historian Charles Deane {{was the first}} scholar to question specific details of Smith's writings. Smith's version of events is the only source and skepticism has increasingly been expressed about its veracity. One reason for such doubt is that, despite having published two earlier books about Virginia, Smith's earliest-surviving account of his rescue by Pocahontas dates from 1616, nearly 10 years later, in a letter entreating Queen Anne to treat Pocahontas with dignity. The time gap in publishing his story <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> that Smith may have exaggerated or invented the event to enhance Pocahontas' image. However, in a recent book, professor Leo Lemay of the University of Delaware points out that Smith's earlier writing was primarily geographical and ethnographic in nature and did not dwell on his personal experiences; hence, {{there was no reason}} for him to write down the story until this point.|$|E
25|$|Convergent {{evolution}} is when distantly related species independently evolve similar {{solutions to the}} same problem. For example, fish, penguins and dolphins have each separately evolved flippers {{as a solution to}} the problem of moving through the water. What has been found between dogs and humans is something less frequently demonstrated: psychological convergence. Dogs have independently evolved to be cognitively more similar to humans than we are to our closest genetic relatives. Dogs have evolved specialized skills for reading human social and communicative behavior. These skills seem more flexible – and possibly more human-like – than those of other animals more closely related to humans phylogenetically, such as chimpanzees, bonobos and other great apes. This <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> that convergent evolution has occurred: both Canis familiaris and Homo sapiens might have evolved some similar (although obviously not identical) social-communicative skills – in both cases adapted for certain kinds of social and communicative interactions with human beings.|$|E

25|$|Much of the {{material}} launched need not be delivered to its eventual orbit immediately, which <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> that high efficiency (but slower) engines could move SPS material from LEO to GEO at an acceptable cost. Examples include ion thrusters or nuclear propulsion. Power beaming from geostationary orbit by microwaves carries the difficulty that the required 'optical aperture' sizes are very large. For example, the 1978 NASA SPS study required a 1-km diameter transmitting antenna, and a 10km diameter receiving rectenna, for a microwave beam at 2.45GHz. These sizes can be somewhat decreased by using shorter wavelengths, although they have increased atmospheric absorption and even potential beam blockage by rain or water droplets. Because of the thinned array curse, {{it is not possible}} to make a narrower beam by combining the beams of several smaller satellites. The large size of the transmitting and receiving antennas means that the minimum practical power level for an SPS will necessarily be high; small SPS systems will be possible, but uneconomic.|$|E
25|$|For {{the next}} six months, Nastassya Filippovna is torn between Myshkin's {{compassionate}} and insightful love for her and a self-punishing desire to ruin herself by submitting to Rogozhin's passion. Myshkin is tormented by her suffering, and Rogozhin is tormented by her love for Myshkin and her disdain for his own claims on her. Returning to Petersburg, the Prince visits Rogozhin's house. They discuss religion and exchange crosses, but Nastassya Filippovna remains between them. Myshkin becomes increasingly horrified at Rogozhin's attitude to her. Rogozhin confesses to beating her in a jealous rage and <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of cutting her throat. However, they part as friends, with Rogozhin even making a gesture of concession. The Prince remains troubled {{and for the next}} few hours, he wanders the streets, immersed in intense contemplation. At a certain point, he begins to suspect that Rogozhin is watching him. He returns to his hotel where Rogozhin—who has been hiding in the stairway—attacks him with a knife. At the same moment, the Prince is struck down by a violent epileptic seizure, and Rogozhin flees in a panic.|$|E
