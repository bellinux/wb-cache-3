5|$|Tactile {{communication}} (touch) {{is mostly}} used by lemurs {{in the form}} of grooming, although the ring-tailed lemur also clumps together to sleep (in an order determined by rank), <b>reaches</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> touches adjacent members, and cuffs other members. Reaching out and touching another individual in this species {{has been shown to be}} a submissive behavior, done by younger or submissive animals towards older and more dominant members of the troop. Allogrooming, however, appears to occur more frequently between higher ranking individuals, a shared trait with other primate species. Unlike anthropoid primates, lemur grooming seems to be more intimate and mutual, often directly reciprocated. Anthropoids, on the other hand, use allogrooming to manage agonistic interactions. The ring-tailed lemur is known to be very tactile, spending between 5 and 11% of its time grooming.|$|E
