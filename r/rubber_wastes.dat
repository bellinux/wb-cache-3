40|$|The Nation faces {{ecological}} problems due to {{the accumulation}} of waste automobile and truck tires. The best management strategy for scrap tires that are worn out beyond hope for reuse or retreading is recycling. Utilization of scrap tires should minimize environmental impact and maximize conservation of natural resources. The regulatory practices include landfill bans and scrap tire fees. Because rubber waste does not biodegrade readily, even after long periods of landfill treatment, there is renewed interest in developing alternatives to disposal. One possible solution for this problem is to incorporate rubber particles into cement-based materials. Scrap tires can be shredded into raw materials for use in hundreds of crumb rubber products While very little rubber from used tires goes into the production of new tires, {{a host of other}} products made from recycled tire rubber have come on the market.

Parmi les diverses méthodes envisagées pour la réutilisation ou l'élimination des polymères usagés, les recyclages énergétiques et chimiques peuvent apporter des solutions satisfaisantes et complémentaires au recyclage de la matière. Cet article fait le point sur l'état d'avancement des techniques de valorisation énergétique et chimique des rejets de polymères et il propose une analyse critique des traitements actuels. Increased {{environmental protection}} requires {{the installation of}} new treatment techniques for polymer wastes. Competitive industrial facilities are not available from the economic standpoint for recycling spent plastic and <b>rubber</b> <b>wastes</b> in the form of materials, especially when mixtures are involved. It is only by using other treatment method for the chemical or energy upgrading of polymers, as a supplement to the recycling of materials, that {{it should be possible to}} make a significant reduction in the amount of spent polymers currently being scrapped. The energy upgrading of wastes by incineration with energy recovery or by pyrolysis with the formation of fuels in an interesting approach for a great many countries. When no reuse is possible, the energy content of the material is upgraded before the subsequent scrapping of an ultimate residue that is reduced to its incompressible minimum after having been inerted. There are currently several technical solutions for incineration furnaces and the treatment of the fumes produced, which meet the more and more severe requirements concerning environmental protection. Incineration systems with energy recovery can recover about 8000 thermies per ton of unsorted plastics. They already have an important position, albeit a varying one, from one European country to another (Table 6). They should develop considerably further in the years to come. The pyrolysis or controled thermolysis of polymer wastes is a future route for the recovery of upgradable products in the form of gaseous, liquid or solid fuels, and sometimes in the form of oligomers or monomers. Pyrolysis systems preferably use rotary reactors or a fluidised bed with a view to obtaining a more uniform composition of the products. Chemical upgrading holds an intermediate position between the recycling of materials and energy recycling. It consists in chemically decomposing macromolecules, e. g. by cracking or hydrocracking, hydrolysis, alcoholysis, saponification, etc., with a view to obtaining products or monomers that can be reused for manufacturing new polymers. Chemical recycling is eminently suitable, in particular, for polyolefins, polyesters, polyurethanes and polyamides. To conclude, as our understanding of the effects of incineration improves and as further progress is made in the technological field, incineration with energy recovery should make up a more widely accepted alternative solution for increasing the recycling of polymers. In the medium term, it is thought that pyrolysis, and, more probably, low-temperature thermolysis will be the main routes for the recycling of spent polymers with a view to recovering upgradable raw materials with sufficient degrees of purity. However, the economic cost effectiveness of such processes remains to be proved on the industrial scale. Most experts think that the technology of cracking is potentially the most advantageous among all chemical recycling techniques, but that another 5 to 10 years will be needed for the transformation of polyolefin wastes into refinery feedstocks, to be marketed and industrially applied...|$|E

Also addition of <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> leads to improvement of mechanical properties of composites. The crosslink density of NR composite increases with the increase of <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> loading until 600 phr and after that it decreases due to the stronger the rubber–filler interaction. This leads to the decrease of the swelling index that has the opposite trend of crosslink density. So, the sample with 600 phr <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> is considered the optimum concentration from the swelling measurement. Filler loading results in pronounced increase in the tensile modulus and decease in the elongation at fracture which reflects the reinforcement effect of the filler.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{measurements}} of sound pressure levels on an experimental road section (road pavement with addition of crumb <b>rubber</b> from <b>waste</b> tires) in Mala Ida village (Kosice region, Slovakia) and on a road with stone mastic asphalt in Haniska village (Presov region, Slovakia) are presented in the paper. The results obtained using statistical pass-by methods were compared and they confirmed that road surface with addition of crumb <b>rubber</b> from <b>waste</b> tires produced quieter pavement than stone mastic asphalt road pavement alone...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} three {{different}} acrylate group monomers, namely n-butyl acrylate, methacrylic acid and tripropylene glycol diacrylate of radiation induced grafting onto <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> was studied. The electron beam accelerator operated at voltage of 2 MeV was used to irradiate the <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> at 10 kGy and 100 kGy absorbed radiation dose, respectively. The formation of grafting was observed from {{the increase in the}} grafting yield and confirmed by Transformed Infra-Red Spectroscopy results. According to the result obtained, only tripropylene glycol diacrylate was selected to graft onto <b>waste</b> <b>rubber.</b> The carbonyl bond from acrylate groups was seen at 1726 cm- 1 band which confirmed the presence of TPGDA in the polymer matrix. This indicates the successful preparation of the TPGDA-grafted <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> via radiation induced grafting techniques...|$|R

In this paper are presented the main structural material changes that occur in different areas, located at different distances from the active surface of tools. Structural changes occurred mainly refers to the transformation of white iron surface layer to gray cast iron and graphite separations appearance, which causes the crack primers and cracking corrosion phenomena in tools material...|$|R

Researches and all relevant technical-technological data related to this process are checked at constructed pilot plant. The future construction of these units for <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> and plastic recycling will allow interested parties to achieve the environmental effectiveness and economic efficiency.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Tensile {{test and}} {{morphology}} studies {{were performed to}} determine the influences of Trans-polyoctylene Rubber (TOR) as compatibilizer of NBRr filled ENR 50 with composition of 15 phr. Fine size (300 µm- 700 µm) of NBRr was used as fillers. Both uncompatibilized and compatibilized NBRr/ENR 50 were prepared using two roll mill at room temperature with different php of 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0, 2. 5 and 3. 0. It can be observed that tensile strength and modulus of elasticity were decreased as increased in TOR loading before started to increased at 1. 5 up to 3. 0. Meanwhile, the increment {{in the value of}} elongation at break when increased in the addition of TOR. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the tensile surface fracture of increased TOR loading illustrated a better adhesion and dispersion in comparison of low amount of TOR loading. <b>Rubber</b> <b>waste</b> appeared to have a low percentage by weight in urban waste streams in both industrialized and less-industrialized area. The part of the <b>rubber</b> <b>waste</b> is usually collected separately, directly from generators such as petrol station, garages and junkyards, and it seen to have a limited number of items and materials. The data concerning about the specific compositio...|$|R
