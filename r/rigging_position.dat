30|$|There {{are several}} well killing {{methods used to}} avoid the blowout in a live gas well. A subsea blowout can be brought under control by {{vertical}} re-entry into the blowout well by a <b>rig</b> <b>positioned</b> over the well, re-establishing pressure integrity of the wellhead/BOP by subsea means, drilling a relief well for a reservoir flood kill, or drilling a relief well for dynamic kill. Kastor and Letbetter (1974) published {{one of the first}} papers to discuss well killing which reviewed older methods such as constant bottom-hole pressure method, which in turn infers maintaining a constant pump speed and for the largest part of the kill procedure, maintaining a constant drill pipe pressure.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} avert the {{consequences}} of blowout, the utmost attention {{must be given to}} oil well control. That is why oil well control procedures should be in place {{prior to the start of}} an abnormal situation noticed within the wellbore, and ideally when a new <b>rig</b> <b>position</b> is sited. In other words, this includes the time the new location is picked, all drilling, completion, workover, snubbing and any other drilling-related operations that should be executed with proper oil well control in mind. This type of preparation involves widespread training of personnel, the development of strict operational guidelines and the design of drilling programs — maximizing the probability of successfully regaining hydrostatic control of a well after a significant influx of formation fluid has taken place.|$|R

50|$|A saddle {{that has}} only a cinch in the front is “single rigged”. A saddle that has both a front cinch and a back cinch (sometimes called a flank cinch, even though it should never go around the horse's flanks) is “double rigged”. The rear rigging is meant to {{stabilize}} the saddle. The back cinch is always located just below the cantle and held in place with a cinch hobble {{to prevent it from}} slipping back; however, the position of the front rigging varies. The <b>rig</b> <b>positions</b> are named by how far they are from the cantle to the fork. Placement of the front rigging is a critical component of western saddle design. The closer the rigging is {{to the center of the}} saddle, the more the rider will be balanced over the horse's center of balance, allowing freer movement and agility of horse and rider. On the other hand, the more forward the rigging is set, especially when combined with a back cinch, the more the saddle will set down on the horse, placing the rider a bit behind the horse's center of balance, but creating greater security.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{high-speed}} impact {{between a}} body and water {{is an important}} practical problem, whether due to wave impact on a structural deck or wall, or due to a moving body such as a ship or aircraft hitting water. The very high pressures exerted are difficult to predict {{and the role of}} air may be significant. In this paper, numerical simulations are undertaken to investigate the impact of a rigid horizontal plate onto a wave crest and, in the limit, onto a flat water surface. A two-phase incompressible–compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method for water and air, respectively, is applied where the water phase imposes kinematics on the air phase at the air–water interface and the air phase imposes pressures on the water at the interface. Results are compared with experimental measurements undertaken using a drop <b>rig</b> <b>positioned</b> over a wave flume so that a horizontal plate impacts the water surface in free flight. Numerical predictions of impact pressure are quite accurate; air is shown to have a significant cushioning effect for impact on to flat water and this reduces for waves as the ratio of wave height to wavelength increases...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of mathematical models of marine vehicle manoeuvring {{has had a}} long history. To help quantify different and diverse theories a series of experiments have been proposed. The purpose of these experiments was to determine the out-of-plane forces on an underwater vehicle due to vortex shedding. This paper describes experiments conducted in a Circulating Water Channel to measure pressure and vorticity values at stations along a body of revolution. The-model was a 1 metre long body of revolution, diameter 0. 125 metres with a detachable NACA 0020 appendage. A computer controlled transverse <b>rig</b> <b>positioned</b> a Freestone probe which was used to measure vorticity. A Scanivalve was used to acquire data at thirty-six pressure tappings at each station. Experiment runs were conducted under various conditions. All runs were with the body stationary, and the speed of flow maintained at 2. 5 metres/second. The angle of yaw of the body was varied over a range from 0 degrees to 17. 5 degrees both with and without an appendage. Appendage angles were varied from 0 degrees to 20 degrees whilst keeping the body at a constant yaw angle of zero degrees. Vorticity measurements were integrated to give circulation values for the vortices that were shed from the appendage and the body. Experiment results are compared with potential theory...|$|R

40|$|Theater rigging greatly expands both scenic {{movement}} and storage options when {{putting on a}} production. Small, black-box theaters are often built without rigging equipment in them. Temporary rigging equipment can greatly add to the flexibility of these spaces. A rigging block was designed which can be installed in small theaters by attaching to the existing lighting structure. The design was developed to solve problems encountered when using currently available temporary rigging solutions. The block was designed to lift a 200 pound scenic load while providing a safety factor of 10 : 1. A dual-pulley arrangement allows for flexibility in the placement of <b>rigging</b> <b>positions</b> and better utilization of the available space. Top and bottom pulleys allow for lines to be routed above {{the level of the}} lighting grid. The independent swiveling of the pulleys allows lines to enter and exit the block at different angles, adding significant freedom to the rigging system. Calculations were done to assess the forces and torques to which the block might be subjected. Potential materials were evaluated based on their ability to withstand these forces. An eye was kept toward using available off-the-shelf parts where possible in order to reduce costs and to allow for the system to be used by small theaters working with limited budgets. Thesis (S.

30|$|Loss of {{position}} of the dynamically <b>positioned</b> <b>rig</b> without safe disconnection could result in critical damage to the well barrier, {{as well as to}} exposed subsea equipment. The ultimate consequence could be a blowout and/or severe damage to subsea production systems like production templates, resulting in risk to personnel, environmental damage, financial loss and harm to the reputation of the company (Paula and Fonseca 2013). Currently, all dynamically <b>positioned</b> <b>rigs</b> are equipped with an emergency disconnect button which initiates a pre-programmed sequence of functions designed to secure the well in a minimal amount of time prior to disconnecting the LMRP riser connector (Sattler and Lewis 2004). An emergency disconnect sequence (EDS) is a sequence of actions, events and interlocks that are automatically initiated once the EDS button is pressed on any BOP panel in the rig. These actions will activate the mechanism or equipment responsible for disconnecting the rig from the well (Paula and Fonseca 2013).|$|R

40|$|A {{connected}} riser transmits loads {{acting on}} the rig and the riser, resulting from factors as current and waves, onto a subsea well at the seabed. This loading may induce fatigue damage to the well head (WH) and other subsea equipment. Riser monitoring systems (RMS) have been introduced {{in order to provide}} a more accurate calculation of this accumulated damage, as well as providing guidance for optimal <b>rig</b> <b>position,</b> so the operation envelope could be extended. This thesis looks into the possibility of calculating section forces and bending moment at two different locations, the lowermost end of the riser and {{at the top of the}} WH, by using different analytical algorithms. The input to the algorithms are assumed to be provided by a set of instrumentation, that measures forces and other important parameters at the lower tapered stress joint (LTSJ) and on top of the lower stack. The algorithms extrapolate loads from the measured positions to any location in the lower stack. The algorithms derived in this project are tested and compared with each other, for various combinations of wave loads, rig offset, current and boundary conditions for the well head. All the testing is done by using an FE analysis of the considered system to provide both input values to the algorithms, as well as reference values for comparison of the results. It is also tested how different configurations for placing the instrumentation at the LTSJ affect the analytical calculated results at the lowermost end of the LTSJ. The testing has showed that the analytically calculated results at the lowermost end of the riser and at top of the WH are in accordance with the results from FE analysis. It has also been found that the configuration for placement of instrumentation at the LTSJ strongly affect the accuracy of the algorithms' results...|$|R

40|$|M. Sc. Due to {{the demand}} for medical isotopes, new Materials Testing Reactors (MTR's) are being {{considered}} and built globally. Different countries all have varying design requirements resulting in a plethora of different designs. South-Africa is also considering a new MTR reactor for dedicated medical radio-isotope production. A neutronic analysis of these various designs is used to ascertain/evaluate the viability of each. Most safety and utilization parameters can be calculated from the neutron flux. The code systems {{that are used to}} perform these analysis are either stochastic or deterministic in nature. In performing such an analysis the tracking of the depletion of isotopes is essential, to ensure that the modeled macroscopic cross-sections are {{as close as possible to}} that of the actual reactor. Stochastic methods are currently too slow when performing depletion analysis, but are very accurate and flexible. Deterministic based methods, on the other hand are much faster, but are generally not as accurate or flexible due to the approximations made in solving the Boltzmann Transport Equation. The aim of this work is therefore to synergistically use a deterministic (diffusion) code to obtain an equilibrium material distribution for a given design and a stochastic (Monte Carlo) code to evaluate the neutronics of the resulting core model - therefore applying a hybrid approach to conceptual core design. A comparison between the hybrid approach and the diffusion code demonstrates the limitations and strengths of the diffusion-based calculational path for various core designs. In order to facilitate the described process, and implement it in a consistent manner, a computational tool termed COREGEN has been developed. This tool facilitates the creation of neutronics models of conceptual reactor cores for both the Monte Carlo and diffusion codes in order to implement the described hybrid approach. The system uses the Monte-Carlo based MCNP code system developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory as stochastic solver, and the nodal diffusion based OSCAR- 4 code system developed at Necsa as the deterministic solver. Given basic input for a core design, COREGEN will generate a detailed OSCAR- 4 and MCNP input model. An equilibrium core obtained by running OSCAR- 4, is then used in the MCNP model. COREGEN will analyze the most important core parameters with both codes and provide comparisons. In this work, various MTR reactor designs are evaluated to meet the primary requirement of isotope production. A heavy water reflected core with 20 isotope production rigs was found to be the most promising candidate. Based on the comparison of the various parameters between Monte Carlo and diffusion for the various cores, we found that the diffusion based OSCAR- 4 system compares well to Monte Carlo in the neutronic analysis of cores with in-core irradiation positions (average error 4. 5 % in assembly power). However, for the heavy water reflected cores with ex-core rigs, the diffusion method differs significantly from the MonteCarlo solution in the <b>rig</b> <b>positions</b> (average error 17. 0 % in assembly power) and parameters obtained from OSCAR must be used with caution in these ex-core regions. The solution of the deterministic approach in in-core regions corresponded to the stochastic approach within 7 % (in assembly averaged power) for all core designs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn an onshore oil field, the {{productivity}} of oil wells decreases when they require maintenance. To restore full productivity at a well, it must be visited by a specially equipped vehicle, called a workover rig. Given a set of wells needing maintenance and a heterogeneous fleet of workover rigs, the workover rig routing problem (WRRP) consists of finding rig routes that minimize the total production loss of the wells over a finite horizon. The wells have different loss rates, require various services, {{and may not be}} serviced within the horizon due to rig availability. The <b>rigs</b> have initial <b>positions</b> and {{do not have the same}} equipment.

30|$|The {{construction}} of petroleum wells {{is becoming more}} and more complex and challenging, especially in regard to drilling and completion in deep and ultra-deepwater, which requires the use of increasingly sophisticated dynamically <b>positioned</b> <b>rigs</b> (Paula and Fonseca 2013). In normal drilling operations, the primary well control is the hydrostatic pressure exerted by the drilling fluid in the well, which can be adjusted to specific conditions through variations in the fluid density. Proper well planning requires that the pressure inside the wellbore should overbalance the formation pressure by a certain safety margin. This can be attained by the hydrostatic head of the drilling fluid or the combination of applied surface backpressure and the hydrostatic head of the drilling fluid (managed pressure drilling—MPD scenario). As a secondary barrier during drilling, the blowout preventer (BOP) is designed to close the well annulus or the drill pipe (Cai et al. 2012). In deepwater and ultra-deepwater drilling operations, the BOP is latched onto a wellhead, situated on the seabed (Huse and Alme 2013).|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the challenges that comes when petroleum activities is moving further north into an arctic environment. The arctic has new challenges, as cold hard weather, snow and ice. The marine structures have to be specialized to cope with the location and new concept has to be developed that is better suited for these situations {{and they have to be}} more cost efficient. Some of the new concept that is being developed is drilling rigs that are placed on the seabed, an exploration rig that will be placed on the sea floor, and therefore not be exposed to the hard conditions on the surface. One of these that are being developed is the Norwegian developed Seabed Rig. But a rig on the seabed needs support from the surface to control the drilling operation. So the surface support vessel and support systems needs to withstand the harsh environment and be easy to control. The study gives a summary of some of the support systems and flexible riser solutions that exist and gives a specific recommendation for the concept that will be the best suited for an exploration drilling <b>rig</b> <b>positioned</b> on the seafloor. Of the options that are described, it appeared that the best option for a support vessel to a subsea drilling rig is a small to medium sized ship or semi, and with dynamic positioning (DP) to keep the vessel in <b>position</b> over the <b>rig.</b> The solution will also make it easier to move from the location due to bad weather conditions or ice and come back to start drilling operation. Of the flexible riser solutions considered, the lazy S configuration seems to be the best suited. Design will have to be optimized, but this solution can reduce the loads on the support vessel and be easier to handle when operations have to be stopped and started again due to weather or ice conditions. A short review of alternative programs for analysis of support vessel and riser solutions is included.

De marine konstruksjoner m&# 229; v&# 230;re spesialisert for &# 229; kunne takle disse utfordringene, og nye konseptet m&# 229; bli utviklet som er bedre egnet for slike forhold og er mer kostnadseffektivt. Noe av det nye konseptet som er utviklet er rigger som er plassert p&# 229; havbunnen, en leterigg som plasseres p&# 229; havbunnen, og er derfor ikke utsettes for de harde forhold p&# 229; overflaten. Et av disse konseptene er det norsk utviklede Seabed Rig. En borerigg p&# 229; havbunnen har behov for st&# 248;tte fra overflaten for &# 229; kunne styre boreprosessen, derfor trenger det et overflatest&# 248;ttefart&# 248;y samt st&# 248;ttesystemer som t&# 229;ler de harde forholdene p&# 229; overflaten og som ogs&# 229; vil v&# 230;re lett &# 229; operere.

Systematic investigations have been performed with simple configurations based on NACA 0012 airfoil sections (e. g. wing, wing with horizontal tail, wing with vertical tail) in order to obtain a more detailed understanding of the unsteady aerodynamical and flight mechanical behavior of such configurations. Further calculations were performed for a set of experimental data measured on a generic modern transport aircraft configuration (DLR-F 12) tested in the 3 m Low Speed Wind Tunnel NWB of the German-Dutch Wind Tunnels DNW, Germany, using a unique six degree-of-freedom test <b>rig</b> called 'Model <b>Positioning</b> Mechanism' (MPM). One objective of this investigation is to adapt the numerical methods for the calculations of dynamic derivatives and to validate the numerical methods by means of wind tunnel data...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} into normal coronal plane range-of-motion at the ankle-joint-complex. To facilitate this, an accurate and reliable measurement rig was designed. The range of motion at the ankle joint complex was measured in one hundred subjects of both sexes (mean age 24. 6, range 18 - 49) by applying a torque of 4 Nm to an axis which deviated medially by 16 degrees. The results showed a mean equilibrium position of 19. 5 degrees inverted, a mean total range of motion from the equilibrium position of 66. 15 degrees, and a mean total inversion value from horizontal of 64. 4 degrees. Three further experiments were carried out. The purpose of these was to examine diurnal variation in range of motion (n = 7), to {{examine the effect of}} <b>rig</b> axis <b>position</b> on the range of motion (n = 15), and to look for any difference in ankle joint complex range of motion in those patients with symptoms proximal to the ankle, and those with symptoms distal to the ankle (n = 20). Significant differences in measurement for each variable at each time interval for all subjects were observed, and significant differences in range of motion were found for each measurement, apart from inversion, when movement around different axis orientations were compared. Similar inversion values are due to the difference m equilibrium position between an axis bisecting the foot and an axis which deviates by 16 degrees medially, and a comparison of inversion values from horizontal show a mean difference of 27 degrees. No significant difference m range of motion was found in a comparison study of patients with symptoms distal and proximal to the ankle joint complex. The findings of this study have important implications both for clinical practice in the field of foot and ankle treatment, and for further research into ranges of motion at the ankle joint complex...|$|R
