40|$|Resilient <b>readers</b> are {{characterized}} by impaired phonological processing despite skilled text comprehension. We investigated orthographic and semantic processing in resilient <b>readers</b> to examine mechanisms of compensation for poor phonological decoding. Performance on phonological (phoneme deletion, pseudoword reading), orthographic (orthographic choice, orthographic analogy), and semantic (semantic priming, homograph resolution) tasks was compared between resilient, poor and proficient <b>readers.</b> Asymmetry of the planum temporale was investigated {{in order to determine}} whether atypical <b>readers</b> showed unusual morphology in this language-relevant region. Resilient <b>readers</b> showed deficits on phonological tasks similar to those shown by poor <b>readers.</b> We obtained no evidence that resilient <b>readers</b> compensate via superior orthographic processing, as they showed neither exceptional orthographic skill nor increased reliance on orthography to guide pronunciation. Resilient <b>readers</b> benefited more than poor or proficient <b>readers</b> from semantic relationships between words and experienced greater difficulty when such relationships were not present. We suggest, therefore, that resilient <b>readers</b> compensate for poor phonological decoding via greater reliance on word meaning relationships. The reading groups did not differ in mean asymmetry of the planum temporale. However, resilient <b>readers</b> showed greater variability in planar asymmetry than proficient <b>readers.</b> Poor <b>readers</b> also showed a trend towards greater variability in planar asymmetry, with more poor <b>readers</b> than proficient <b>readers</b> showing extreme asymmetry. Such increased variability suggests that university students with less reading skill display less well regulated brain anatomy than proficient <b>readers.</b> © 2010 Elsevier Inc...|$|R

50|$|The Simple View of Reading was {{originally}} described by Gough and Tunmer in 1986 and modified by Hoover and Gough in 1990. The Simple View {{suggests that the}} ultimate goal of reading comprehension, and in order to have good reading comprehension, you need to have good decoding ability (e.g., ability to interpret the symbols) and good listening comprehension (e.g., your ability to understand oral language). This model predicts four categories of <b>readers.</b> <b>Readers</b> with poor decoding skills but relatively preserved listening comprehension skills would be considered <b>readers</b> who are poor decoders, or dyslexic. <b>Readers</b> with poor listening comprehension skills are referred to as <b>readers</b> who are poor comprehenders. <b>Readers</b> with poor decoding skills and poor listening comprehension skills are considered poor <b>readers,</b> or sometimes referred to as garden-variety poor <b>readers.</b> <b>Readers</b> who have good decoding and listening comprehension skills are considered typical <b>readers.</b>|$|R

He aimed to keep the arrangements as open as possible, to re-create the simplicity of the standards, and became preoccupied with creating only pieces that could fit within the Great American Songbook. In 2013 Beck began playing special Song <b>Reader</b> concerts with a variety of guests and announced he was working on a record of Song <b>Reader</b> material with other musicians as well as possibly a compilation of fan versions.|$|E
