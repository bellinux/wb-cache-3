50|$|The empty {{building}} {{began to}} attract vandals. In 1968 squatters occupied it and valuable brass fittings and <b>roof</b> <b>lead</b> were stolen. The continuing decay and damage {{led to the}} formation of the Theatre Royal Society which pressured to defend and preserve the building. This campaign included the locally born actor Brian Murphy who had starred in 'The Boyfriend' and is now a patron of the theatre. The society became the New Theatre Royal trust in 1976.|$|R
500|$|Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, {{stayed there}} in 1560. As a result, £67 {{was spent on}} {{materials}} and repairs: the walls were re-pointed, <b>roof</b> <b>lead</b> re-laid, gutters and broken windows repaired, a chimney rebuilt, dining chamber on the Great [...] Hall enlarged, two doors cut through a wall {{and the construction of}} a new stone window. Materials purchased included 4000 bricks and a considerable amount of glass from Hartlepool. Norfolk was imprisoned nine years later by Elizabeth I for plotting to marry Mary, Queen of Scots.|$|R

50|$|The {{red brick}} Marmorpalais was {{originally}} a two-story square building. A fine {{view of the}} surrounding gardens and lakes is possible from a round pavilion on the flat roof of the cubical structure. Among other buildings, the little castle on the Pfaueninsel in the Havel river was constructed as an eye-catcher. A stairway and gallery accessed from the <b>roof</b> <b>lead</b> into the belvedere. Sculptured putti carrying a basket of fruit decorate {{the tip of the}} pavilion. The palace got its name from the grey and white Silesian marble used for the decorative elements and partitioning structures.|$|R

50|$|John U. Nef, {{an expert}} on Renaissance economics, {{described}} liquation as ‘even {{more important than the}} invention of the printing press’ for the development of industry during this period. It increased production of silver on a massive scale. Between 1460 and 1530, the output of silver increased as much as fivefold in central Europe. This had a secondary effect of lowering the costs of producing copper at a time when its demand had increased due {{to the needs of the}} brassmaking industry, and the use of copper on ships and <b>roofs.</b> <b>Lead</b> production also received a boost, indeed the lack of lead available held the liquation process back until a large lead-bearing seam was discovered at Tarnowitz in Poland.|$|R
50|$|The plumber John Scott of Edinburgh re-plated the <b>roof</b> in <b>lead</b> in 1743. Some minor {{additions}} {{were carried}} out in the following years. John Adam resurfaced the building in 1762 and James Playfair inserted a low window into the east facade in 1786.|$|R
5000|$|St Augustine's Church {{had many}} {{structural}} problems. Rainwater had penetrated the <b>roof</b> after <b>lead</b> was stolen. In 2004 {{the city council}} planniners gave consent to demolish the church and build a new structure. The church was deemed unsafe in 2007 and closed.|$|R

25|$|In 1984, {{the house}} was given a rare copy of the Parthenon Frieze made by Brucciani & Co. which is {{displayed}} in the old kitchens (now known as the Elgin Room). The Great Storm of 1987 caused damage {{to the house and}} gardens (with No. 656 Squadron AAC assisting in the delivery of new <b>roof</b> <b>lead</b> in 1988 using a Westland Lynx in an operation covered by Blue Peter). Except for a small contribution by English Heritage and the Department of the Environment, private ownership restricted access to heritage grants; the restoration was almost entirely funded from visitors (costing more than £140,000 between 1982 and 1989), making it the largest private restoration project in Europe at the time. Works continued into the new millennium and a programme of rolling restoration is ongoing.|$|R

50|$|Any {{sheet of}} {{material}} {{used to cover}} a flat or low-pitched roof is usually known as a membrane and {{the primary purpose of}} these membranes is to waterproof the roof area. Materials that cover flat roofs typically allow the water to run off from a slight inclination or camber into a gutter system. Water from some flat roofs such as on garden sheds sometimes flows freely off the edge of a roof, though gutter systems are of advantage in keeping both walls and foundations dry. Gutters on smaller <b>roofs</b> often <b>lead</b> water directly onto the ground, or better, into a specially made soakaway. Gutters on larger <b>roofs</b> usually <b>lead</b> water into the rainwater drainage system of any built up area. Occasionally, however, flat roofs are designed to collect water in a pool, usually for aesthetic purposes, or for rainwater buffering.|$|R
50|$|The Valor Ecclesiasticus of 1535 put a {{value of}} £72 15. 8d. on the priory. Although it was solvent, it fell well short of the £200 {{threshold}} for continuation. The priory was dissolved in 1536. The prior, William Prowde, was given a pension of £11. The contents were sold off {{for a total of}} £140 9s. 3¾d., while the <b>roof</b> <b>lead</b> and bells raised £30 5s. The estates were leased in their entirety to William Abbot for 20 years, after which the reversion was sold to James Leveson, who also paid off Abbot's lease, thus becoming outright owner. In 1547, shortly before he died, Leveson sold the Wombridge demesne lands, about 96 acres, to William Charlton, the former priory steward, who had been acting as bailiff of the lands. However, Leveson reserved the coal mines for himself.|$|R

50|$|Lead {{has been}} a popular roofing {{material}} for centuries, being used for roofing, flashing, gutters, downspouts, and conductor heads. Lead was best suited for low-pitched roofs, as steep <b>roofs</b> experienced creep. <b>Lead</b> <b>roofs</b> in regions with large temperature fluctuations, such as the mid-Atlantic states, experienced deterioration from constant expansion and contraction, called fatigue. Beginning in the 19th century, a roofing material called “terne” or “terneplate” was used, consisting of sheet iron or sheet steel coated with a lead-tin alloy. It is frequently confused with tinplate.|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{stratification}} {{in large}} warehouses {{is a common}} phenomenon in winter, especially in regions with cold climates. Natural buoyancy causes warmer air to move upwards towards the ceiling. The relatively high temperature beneath the <b>roof</b> <b>leads</b> to {{a large amount of}} heating energy loss. Nowadays, mixing the air is one of the effective methods for reducing thermal stratification which have started to be used in industrial warehouses. This thesis aims to determine thermal stratification conditions in five warehouses via field measurement. Furthermore, this thesis also aims to investigate the effects of mechanical mixing of indoor air with fans using CFD-based numerical simulations. For these objectives, field measurement of thermal stratification in five warehouses was conducted and used to validate CFD models. Meanwhile, two warehouses were simulated in CFD. ANSYS FLUENT, a commercial CFD package, was used to the indoor air flow in this thesis. The numerical temperature results were validated by comparison with the on-site measurement data. The vertical temperature profiles and rate of heat flow from different cases were compared. The effectiveness of different fan configurations in reducing thermal stratification was evaluated...|$|R
