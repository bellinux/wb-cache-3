INTRODUCTION The well-studied Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) problem for DEM generation involves the derivation of topographic information from <b>radar</b> <b>phase.</b> The topography is proportional to the full phase, whereas the measured phase is modulo 2, necessitating the process of recovering full phase values via phase unwrapping. In general, the presence of noise, phase discontinuities, and the sheer size of the problem make phase-unwrapping challenging. Our research is motivated by recent work[1, 2] which models the phase unwrapping problem as a discrete optimization problem.

40|$|Determining the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface {{topography}} and deformation with interferometric {{synthetic aperture}} radar involves measurement of phase, which, for a typical coherent radar signal, can only be done modulo 2 π. The cycle of ambiguity inherent in the phase measurement has to be unwrapped over all observation dimensions (e. g., azimuth, range, and time) to remove the 2 π ambiguity of the phase measurements. For a time series of SAR images, useful for reducing noise in topographic applications or measuring time-varying surface deformation, the necessary steps to connect ambiguous <b>radar</b> <b>phase</b> measurements are more challenging, and the operation may be termed 3 -D phase unwrapping.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{studies the}} jitter {{effects on the}} {{detection}} performance of M-sequence-based multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar systems through time domain simulations. Jitter was modeled {{to be present in}} the system as timing jitter in the receivers ’ clock, and as phase jitter in the receivers ’ local oscillators. The system performance was evaluated in terms of probability of detection versus signal to noise ratio (SNR). Three types of MIMO radar processing schemes are investigated: a non-coherent MIMO, a decentralized radar network (DRN), and a re-phased netted radar (RPNR) processing. It was found that the presence of time jitter degraded the detection performance of the RPNR; however, it did not impose significant effects on the non-coherent MIMO and DRN processing schemes. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the phase jitter at the MIMO radar receivers directly influenced the SNR yielding the same probability of detection, regardless the type of processing scheme chosen. Limiting the phase jitter terms to below 0. 1 radian suppresses the performance degradation. Index Terms—MIMO <b>radar,</b> <b>phase</b> jitter, probability of detection, time jitte...|$|E

30|$|The {{possibility}} to use shaped phase fronts {{will be of}} particular interest when using the large EISCAT_ 3 D aperture in the near field, i.e. for lower atmosphere measurements. At these altitudes, the phase fronts emanating from a dish antenna of equivalent size to the EISCAT_ 3 D array would be highly non-planar, making it complicated to interpret the instantaneous signal received from a broad, distributed, horizontally stratified target such as the atmosphere. As long as the beam shape and the physics of the scattering process are known, of course, any such scattering problem can be handled by inversion techniques, but the ability to conduct adaptive beam shaping to reduce the degree of non-planarity in the <b>radar</b> <b>phase</b> fronts can simplify the problem by reducing the need for computationally intensive inversion. The ability to control phase front shape may thus be important in the plans to use EISCAT_ 3 D for meteorological applications.

30|$|As ATI SAR {{output is}} signal power, slowly moving targets will not {{attenuated}} {{along with the}} stationary clutter when we utilize magnitude and phase information for target extraction. In the case of low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR), the ATI SAR will lose its ability to detect slowly moving targets and to correctly estimate their velocities because the system noise (additive thermal noise and multiplicative <b>radar</b> <b>phase</b> noise) scatters the stationary clutter signal around the real axis in the complex plane. If the clutter contribution is not negligible {{when compared to the}} signal power, the estimation of the target radial velocity from the contaminated interferometric phase may lead to erroneous results. When the SCR is small, this effect will become more serious for slowly moving targets and the moving targets will be indistinguishable from the clutter. Moreover, in this case, the targets' impulse responses are not normal delta functions, particularly for the moving targets which are poorly focused because of the unmatched azimuth-compression filter. This leads to a point target's response overlaps with several neighboring resolution cells. This also means a varying SCR across the target's response, which in turn affects its interferometric phase. Therefore, the ATI SAR is a clutter limited moving targets detector and applying some efficient clutter suppression or cancelation techniques is necessary.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The well-studied Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) {{problem for}} digital {{elevation}} map generation involves the derivation of topography from <b>radar</b> <b>phase.</b> The topography {{is a function}} of the full phase, whereas the measured phase is known modulo 2 ss, necessitating the process of recovering full phase values via phase unwrapping. This mathematical process becomes difficult through the presence of noise and phase discontinuities. This paper is motivated by recent research which models phase unwrapping as a network flow minimization problem. A major limitation is that often a substantial computational effort is required to find solutions. Commonly these phase images are huge (AE 10 million pixels) and obviously the sheer size of the problem itself makes phase unwrapping challenging. This paper addresses the development of a computationally efficient hierarchical algorithm, based on a "divide-and-conquer " approach. We have shown that the phase unwrapping problem can first be partitioned into independent phase unwrapping subproblems, which can further be recombined to produce the unwrapped phase. Interestingly, the recombination step itself can be interpreted as an unwrapping problem, for which a modified network flow solution applies! In short, this paper develops a parallelization of the network-flow algorithm, allowing images of virtually unlimited size to be unwrapped and leading to dramatic decreases in the algorithm execution time...|$|E
