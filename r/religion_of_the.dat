5|$|Al-Maʿarri is {{controversial}} even today {{as he was}} sceptical of Islam, the dominant <b>religion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arab World. In 2013, almost a thousand years after his death, the al-Nusra Front, a branch of al-Qaeda, beheaded a statue of Al-Maʿarri {{during the civil war}} in Syria. The statue had been crafted by the sculptor Fathi Muhammad. The motive behind the beheading is disputed; theories range from {{the fact that he was}} a heretic to the fact that he is believed by some to be related to the Assad family.|$|E
5|$|All {{the medieval}} {{buildings}} {{that are now}} cathedrals of England were Roman Catholic in origin, as they predate the Reformation.

5|$|By 1827, Protestant Christianity, and in {{particular}} Bingham's teachings, had become the de facto state <b>religion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of Hawaii. Queen Kaʻahumanu persecuted Catholics from 1829 until her death in 1832, by, for example, forbidding Hawaiians from attending masses and instructing Bachelot not to proselytize. In December1831, Bachelot and Short were deported and forced to leave on a ship, the Waverly, bound for North America. Though Queen Kaʻahumanu steadfastly opposed his work, Bachelot viewed her as a good person who had been deceived by Protestant missionaries.|$|E

5|$|By the 12th century, Islam was the {{dominant}} {{religion in the}} Middle East. It is not certain, however, {{if it was the}} <b>religion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> majority outside the Arabian Peninsula. Arabic was the language of high culture and of the urban population, although other languages dating to pre-Islamic rule were still being used to a certain extent. Most Egyptians were speaking Arabic by the time the Ayyubids took power there.|$|E
5|$|Coins of Ezana {{without any}} symbol at all {{have also been}} found, along with similar symboless coins of his father, Ousanas.

The lack of symbol altogether may reflect an uncertainty as how best to exhibit the change in <b>religion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Aksumite state.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1998, the NEA {{implemented}} {{a policy to}} limit the burial period of all graves to 15 years, due to a shortage of space in the cemeteries.

If the <b>religion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased permits cremation, the exhumed remains are cremated and stored in government columbaria niches; otherwise, the remains are re-buried in smaller individual plots.|$|E

5|$|Shamanism was the {{dominant}} <b>religion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jurchen people of northeast Asia {{and of their}} descendants, the Manchu people. As early as the Jin dynasty (1111–1234), the Jurchens conducted shamanic ceremonies at shrines called tangse. There were two kinds of shamans: those who entered in a trance and let themselves be possessed by the spirits, and those who conducted regular sacrifices to heaven, to a clan's ancestors, or to the clan's protective spirits.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} Arsacid patronism of Zoroastrianism is debated in modern scholarship. The {{followers}} of Zoroaster {{would have found}} the bloody sacrifices of some Parthian-era Iranian cults to be unacceptable. However, {{there is evidence that}} Vologeses I encouraged the presence of Zoroastrian magi priests at court and sponsored the compilation of sacred Zoroastrian texts which later formed the Avesta. The Sassanid court would later adopt Zoroastrianism as the official state <b>religion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empire.|$|E

5|$|A {{key element}} of the {{nation-state}} {{is the creation of}} a national culture, frequently—although not necessarily—through deliberate national policy. In the new German nation, a Kulturkampf (1872–78) that followed political, economic, and administrative unification attempted to address, with a remarkable lack of success, some of the contradictions in German society. In particular, it involved a struggle over language, education, and religion. A policy of Germanization of non-German people of the empire's population, including the Polish and Danish minorities, started with language, in particular, the German language, compulsory schooling (Germanization), and the attempted creation of standardized curricula for those schools to promote and celebrate the idea of a shared past. Finally, it extended to the <b>religion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Empire's population.|$|E
5|$|After Arghun's death, he was {{followed}} {{in rapid succession}} by two brief and fairly ineffective leaders, one of whom only held power for a few months. Stability was restored when Arghun's son Ghazan took power in 1295, though to secure cooperation from other influential Mongols, he made a public conversion to Islam {{when he took the}} throne, marking a major turning point in the state <b>religion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ilkhanate. Despite being an official Muslim, however, Ghazan remained tolerant of multiple religions, and worked to maintain good relations with his Christian vassal states such as Cilician Armenia and Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Although Islam is the {{official}} <b>religion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> federation, Sarawak has no official state religion. However, during the chieftainship of Abdul Rahman Ya'kub, the Constitution of Sarawak was amended to make the Yang di-Pertuan Agong {{as the head of}} Islam in Sarawak and empower the state assembly to pass laws regarding Islamic affairs. With such provisions, Islamic policies can be formulated in Sarawak and the establishment of Islamic state agencies is possible. The 1978 Majlis Islam Bill enabled the setting up of Syariah Courts in Sarawak with jurisdictions over matrimonial, child custody, betrothal, inheritance, and criminal cases in the state. An appeals court and Courts of Kadi were also formed.|$|E
