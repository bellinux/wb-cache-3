For example, the command: [...] will display only the lines that include [...] "string"; any global changes one makes on this slice (for example <b>replace</b> <b>string</b> command) will be reflected in the file. (In most cases this is a more convenient way to make global changes in the file.) In order to restore visibility of all lines one needs to enter: all (without a target string).|$|E
40|$|Operational {{transformation}} (OT) is {{an established}} optimistic consistency control method in collaborative applications. This approach requires correct transformation functions. In general all OT algorithms only consider two character-based primitive operations and hardly {{two or three}} of them support string based two primitive operations, insert and delete. In this paper we propose new algorithms that consider first time in history more new string operations that are Find and replace in addition to primitive operations like insert and delete. In history we are having first time algorithms for composite string operation-Find and replace. These algorithms for new Find and <b>replace</b> <b>string</b> operations also support earlier algorithms for primitive string operations-insert and delete. It also handles overlapping and splitting of operations when concurrent operations are transformed. These algorithms can be applied {{in a wide range of}} practical collaborative applications.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{consider}} {{to find a}} set of substrings common to given strings. We define this problem as the template discovery problem which is, given a set of strings generated by some fixed but unknown pattern, to find the constant parts of the pattern. A pattern is a string over constant and variable symbols. It generates <b>strings</b> by <b>replacing</b> variables into constant strings. We assume that the frequency distribution of <b>replaced</b> <b>strings</b> follow a power-law distribution. Although the longest common subsequence problem, {{which is one of}} the famous common part discovery problems, is well-known to be NP-complete, we show that the template discovery problem can be solved in linear time with high probability. This complexity is achieved due to the following our contributions: reformulation of the problem, using a set of substrings to express a string, and counting all occurrences F (f) with frequency f instead of just frequency f. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm using data on the Web. Moreover, we show noise robustness and effectiveness even when input strings are generated by a union of patterns and pattern with the iterate operation. ...|$|R

However, the strings in Dhrystone are of known constant length and their starts are aligned on natural boundaries, two characteristics usually absent from real programs. Therefore, an optimizer can <b>replace</b> a <b>string</b> copy with a sequence of word moves without any loops, which will be much faster. This optimization consequently overstates system performance, sometimes by more than 30%.|$|R
