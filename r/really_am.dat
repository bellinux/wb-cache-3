I'd like to let you all know, despite the situation – I know {{all of you are}} still convinced that I'm the person that killed your father, your son and your brother, but I am innocent. The incident that happened that night was not my fault. I did not have a gun that night. I did not shoot your family member. But I am so sorry for your loss. I <b>really</b> <b>am</b> – sincerely. All I can ask is that each of you look deeper into this case, so that you really will finally see the truth. I ask my family and friends that you all continue to pray, that you all continue to forgive. Continue to fight this fight. For those about to take my life, may God have mercy on all of your souls. God bless you all. He was declared dead at 11:08pm EDT.|$|E

Matsuo Bashō's poetry is internationally renowned; and, in Japan, many of his poems are reproduced on monuments and traditional sites. Although Bashō is justifiably famous in the West for his hokku, he himself believed his best work lay in leading and participating in renku.

500|$|Back in London, Fleming had his manuscript—which he {{described}} as his [...] "dreadful oafish opus"—retyped by Joan Howe, his red-haired secretary at The Times on whom the character Miss Moneypenny was partly based. Clare Blanchard, a former girlfriend, advised him not to publish the book, {{or at least to}} do so under a pseudonym. During the book's final draft stages, Fleming allowed his friend, and later editor, William Plomer to see a copy, and remarked [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>am</b> thoroughly ashamed of it... after rifling through this muck you will probably never speak to me again, but I have got to take that chance." [...] Despite this, Plomer thought the book had sufficient promise and sent a copy to the publishing house Jonathan Cape. At first they were unenthusiastic, but were persuaded to publish on the recommendation of Fleming's older brother, Peter, an established travel writer whose books they managed.|$|E

It was the first video of the eight videos shot in two weeks for the album.

On the other hand, Matsoukas said that the half-day shoot for [...] "Kitty Kat", by comparison, [...] "was a breeze." [...] Elaborating on the conception of the video, Knowles said: [...] "We had the oversized kitty cat , which was so cute! I had to pretend it was there, because I was really {{in front of the}} green screen — I'd be on a big giant wooden cow and they superimposed a kitten. And we used leopard-print makeup and the catsuit and the nails to make me more like a cat. I <b>really</b> <b>am</b> a cat person".|$|E
40|$|This paper takes {{a closer}} look at really in order to account for its various interpretations. Stenstrm's (1986) work on really forms the starting-point for the investigation. The {{following}} examples are from Stenstrm (1986 : 151), where she claims that the different readings of <b>really</b> <b>are</b> due to position and syntactic function: (1) this question <b>is</b> <b>really</b> surprising (2) this <b>is</b> a <b>really</b> surprising question (3) this <b>is</b> <b>really</b> a surprising question (4) this <b>really</b> <b>is</b> a surprising question (5) <b>really</b> this <b>is</b> a surprising question Stenstrm states that when <b>really</b> <b>is</b> placed next to the adjective, as in (1) and (2), it is a degree modifier which serves as an intensifier of surprising. But, the further <b>really</b> <b>is</b> moved to the left, the less is the emphasis on surprising and the more it is on the whole a surprising question. When <b>really</b> <b>is</b> placed in initial position, as in (5), it no longer intensifies a single clause element but is a comment on the whole proposition. Stenstrm remains vague about the intermediate positions and about the more exact interaction between syntactic position and interpretation. She concludes that what finally decides the function of <b>really</b> <b>is</b> the combined effect of position, prosody and the wider context. In contrast to Stenstrm, I propose that the motivating factors for the readings are semantic/pragmatic in nature rather than syntactic/positiona...|$|R

I wanted people to understand like Pusha is everything that I really, <b>really</b> <b>am.</b> Actually, there is a line in 'Pain' where I say [...] "My name is my name," [...] that line comes from Marlo Stanfield from the series The Wire.

I really felt that embodied my presence in the rap game." [...] Pusha T announced the new title of his album in November 2012, along with Spin reporting that his album had been pushed back until 2013. On March 19, 2013 Pusha T said that the album would include 13 songs and that he had already finished 11 of those songs.|$|E
500|$|Like other ABC shows, Quantico has a racially-diverse cast (allowing {{viewers to}} relate {{to at least one}} character) as FBI {{recruits}} who deal with their individual problems. Safran had wanted the show to be diverse from the beginning, saying: [...] "You’re not just watching people who have struggled to achieve places of power and they’re there. This show is about the struggle to achieve that. Their politics and their racial makeup and their religious backgrounds are very important to their characterizations and who they are. I <b>really</b> <b>am</b> interested in looking at how every culture handles stress — and in particular, how people from all these different backgrounds find their place in the FBI, an agency that has historically fraught relationships with gay people and people of color." [...] The first actor cast in the series was Tate Ellington, as FBI trainee Simon Asher. Graham Rogers was then cast as another FBI trainee, Caleb Hass. It was announced that Aunjanue Ellis had signed to play Miranda Shaw, assistant director and training supervisor of the academy. Dougray Scott was then cast as Liam O'Connor, Miranda's former partner and current subordinate.|$|E

Mauboy cites Mariah Carey as her main influence and inspiration, stating that she has [...] "drawn a lot of inspiration from watching and listening to her live performances". She grew {{up listening to}} many of Carey's songs and was inspired by her vocal style and songwriting, [...] "I loved 'Dreamlover' and 'Fantasy' – and picked up loads of tips from her style of singing. She taught me that the lyrics you write have to come from personal experiences – I really felt her music. Now I aspire to writing honest lyrics with real feelings that people can relate to." [...] Mauboy also names Whitney Houston as another influence, stating that she looks up to her and Carey [...] "for their outstanding vocal performances". Her other musical influences are John Farnham and Beyoncé. Mauboy is also inspired by fellow Indigenous Australian women such as Olympic gold medalist Cathy Freeman and actress Deborah Mailman.|$|E

In a 2003 interview with Bloom, Michael Pakenham, the book editor for The Baltimore Sun, writes that Bloom has long referred to himself as a [...] "Jewish Gnostic". Bloom explains: [...] "I am using Gnostic in a very broad way. I am nothing if not Jewish... I <b>really</b> <b>am</b> a product of Yiddish culture. But I can't understand a Yahweh, or a God, who could be all-powerful and all knowing and would allow the Nazi death camps and schizophrenia."

2500|$|In {{the early}} years of the Crystal Palace, Grove devoted much of his leisure time to Biblical scholarship. Discovering that there was no full {{concordance}} of the proper names in the Bible, Grove, helped by his wife, began work in 1853 making a complete index of each occurrence of every proper name in the Bible, including the Apocrypha. Between 1860 and 1863, Grove was assistant editor to Sir William Smith in a comprehensive Bible dictionary, contributing more than a thousand pages. Some entries written by Grove, such as that on the prophet Elijah, were equivalent almost to book-length. He visited the Holy Land in 1859 and 1861, and helped to found the Palestine Exploration Fund, of which he became honorary secretary, labouring incessantly on its behalf. The Archbishop of York said that Grove was [...] "virtually the founder and institutor of the Society, and has done wonders for it throughout." [...] Grove later observed, [...] "People will insist on thinking of me as a musician, which I <b>really</b> <b>am</b> not in the very least degree. I took quite as much interest in my investigations into the natural features and the little towns of Palestine which I did for Smith's Dictionary of the Bible or for Arthur Stanley's Sinai and Palestine, as I did for Beethoven and Mendelssohn, indeed perhaps more so." ...|$|E

[...] "I'm not trying to be edgy, sassy, romantic, vulnerable or whatever emotions come across," [...] she said. [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>am</b> all that." [...] Afrodisiac contains several references to Timbaland and longtime partner Missy Elliott, and alludes to fellow 1990s R singers such as Aaliyah and Monica. The album's opening track [...] "Who I Am" [...] discusses her rocky relationship with Robert Smith as well as the progression of her public image, while [...] "I Tried" [...] was heavily inspired by English rock band Coldplay, also incorporating lyrics of their 2000 song [...] "Sparks." [...] The tenth track [...] "Turn It Up" [...] is an homage to the early 1990s with references to Donnie Simpson's Video Soul, Kid n' Play, their 1990 film House Party and Tony! Toni! Toné!'s 1996 studio album House of Music. The line [...] "'Cause I don't wanna sound familiar, want a guaranteed single, not an album filler" [...] levels indirect criticism at former main producer Rodney Jerkins.
