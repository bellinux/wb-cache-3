5|$|Many Turkish {{cities and}} towns have vibrant local music scenes which, in turn, support a number of {{regional}} musical styles.

With the support of Sezen Aksu, the resurging popularity of pop music gave rise to several international Turkish pop stars such as Tarkan and Sertab Erener. The late 1990s also saw an emergence of underground music producing alternative Turkish rock, electronica, hip-hop, <b>rap</b> <b>and</b> dance music in opposition to the mainstream corporate pop and arabesque genres, which many believe have become too commercial.|$|E
