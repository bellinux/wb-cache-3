40|$|Accurate {{mapping of}} wind {{ventilation}} {{in an urban}} environment is challenging when large spatial coverage is required. This study has developed a GIS-based model for estimating the frontal area index (FAI) of buildings, infrastructure, and trees using very high resolution airborne {{light detection and ranging}} (LiDAR) data, which {{can also be used to}} investigate the “wall effect” caused by high-rise buildings at a finer spatial scale along the coasts in the Kowloon Peninsula of Hong Kong. New algorithms were created by improving previous algorithms utilizing airborne LiDAR data in <b>raster</b> <b>unit,</b> as well as considering the backward flow coefficient between windward and leeward buildings. The ventilation corridors estimated by FAI and least cost path (LCP) analysis were analyzed. The optimal ventilation corridors passing through the Kowloon peninsula were observed in the east-west and west-east directions. In addition, these ventilation paths were validated with a computer fluid dynamics (CFD) model i. e. Airflow Analysis in ESRI. The newly developed model calculates finer FAI with greater accuracy when compared with vector-based building polygons. This model further depicts buildings, infrastructure, and trees which are considered as obstacles to wind ventilation. The results can be used by environmental and planning authorities to identify ventilation corridors, and for scenario analysis in urban redevelopment.

40|$|The keystones of {{research}} on modem volcanic hazards and calamity are from static research on local or regional change to dynamic research on global change, which emphasize particularly on monitoring volcanic activity and countermeasures of disaster recovery. Geological problems are,emphases of volcano study in China {{in the past few}} years. Research on volcano mitigation starts now. There is still few case of integrative risk assessment. Baitoushan volcano in the Changbaishan region is an active volcano with the most possible eruption and causing hazards in China. So the paper introduces a kind of brand-new Geographic method-Geographical Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) to risk evaluation of volcanic hazards and attempt to introduce a kind of new risk evaluation approach of volcanic hazards based on Area Source Model. When choosing evaluative indexes, we take three aspects of fatalness of volcanic hazards, socio-economic vulnerability, harmfulness of causing-disaster factors into account. The fundamental data of evaluation in the studied area are acquired by the method of man-machine interpreting TM image, and referring to forefathers' research results to do correction. Cell (1 km X 1 km size of <b>raster</b> <b>unit)</b> is partitioned in Changbaishan region, which is realized in raster GIS platform. The above results were combined with the cell based on Area Source Model following mathematical models of risk evaluation on ARC/INFO GRID sub modular. From risk evaluation result of volcanic hazards in Changbaishan region we can conclude that: (1) The value of risk is lower with far from Baitoushan crater, which is tallied with other scholars' and the general cognition. (2) The contribution to risk of pyroclastic flow is very big, while the influence of fulgurite is comparatively small, which is identical {{with the fact that the}} amount and harmfulness of pyroclastic is much larger than fulgurite. The following fact shows that the method that the dissertation adopts is very practicable...|$|E
40|$|Cleanup {{plans for}} {{contaminated}} surface soils are frequently developed {{with the goal}} of ensuring that regulatory criteria for risk exposure are met after remediation. Currently, some of the plans for Superfund sites are {{based on the premise that}} a concentration equal to the average goal or based on a confidence level expression of the concentration measurements is not to be exceeded (NTE). However, in cases of wide-spread, low-level contamination, the NTE constraint may result in lowering risk well below the regulatory criteria and substantially increasing remediation costs. An alternative method, floating spatial domain averaging (FSDA), is developed and expanded. FSDA is a multi-criteria decision making tool in which concentrations or risk factors are averaged over domains which represent possible human exposure areas. The domains are variable in space. The averaging domain floats over the surface in increments representative of a field sample size (cell) or Geographical Information System (GIS) spatially interpolated <b>raster</b> <b>unit.</b> This allows for the incorporation of domain-wide topological information into the averaging operation around each cell and also the consideration of flexibility in the choices for the future development of the site. ^ The FSDA model is based upon linear averaging equations and can be analyzed both manually and also with the aid of linear programming optimization routines. The resultant solutions can be compared to the NTE approach. This modeling effort is further expanded to include multiple risk factors, maximum contaminant level (MCL) constraints, spatial domain or lot size variations and sampling limitations. ^ The multi-component FSDA model portraying a hypothetical site with low-level, wide-spread surface soil contamination and MCL constraints, resulted in the determination of several remediation plans. Many of these alternatives allow for a marked reduction in the extent of required remediation, while complying with the pre-determined cleanup goals and considering flexibility in future land use decisions. The reduction was particularly evident in cases where the number of cells within each area was limited by sampling constraints. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} quality of SRTM 3 data for alpine and plateau areas in Northwestern (NW) China against DEM data {{extracted}} from topographic maps. These SRTM data were obtained from both the ESRI ArcGIS 9. 2 software package and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory website. It shows that these two data sources provide the approximate precision as the DEM based on 1 : 250000 scale topographic maps in general. In our study area, the ESRI SRTM data have about 38 % of <b>raster</b> <b>units</b> with less than 10 m absolute elevation error, 58 %; < 20 m, 90 %; < 49 m, 95 %; < 65 m, 99 %; < 92 m, and 99. 9 %; < 143 m compared with the topographic maps. The delta surface void filling process conducted on the ESRI SRTM data {{does not change the}} error scheme of the total DEM. In relatively low and flat basins, as well as the wide valleys on the plateau, the absolute elevation error is typically less than 5 m. Significant errors of more than tens or hundreds of meters were obtained in rugged mountainous areas, even lakes and reservoirs in low land. Furthermore, the author suggested that the slope of terrain has no effect on the error, while the northern slope has higher minus mean error compared with the southern one. At last, elevation errors in glacial, deciduous forest and desert settings present a normal Gaussian distribution with all the peaks at- 20 to 0 m, and few <b>raster</b> <b>units</b> with absolute errors of more than 100 - 200 m...|$|R

This thesis evaluates the suitability of using parallelization on graphic card for raster image adjustments based on multicriterial choice. Filters are implemented for graphics processing unit in CUDA language. Opacity and image merging mode can be set for filters. Various types of filters were implemented like histogram, color, convolution filters and others.

50|$|The term pixel fillrate {{refers to}} the number of pixels a video card can render to screen and write to video memory in a second or in case of texture fillrate the number of texture map {{elements}} (texels) GPU can map to pixels in a second. Pixel fillrates are given in megapixels per second or in gigapixels per second (in the case of newer cards), and they are obtained by multiplying the number of <b>Raster</b> Output <b>Units</b> (ROPs) by the clock frequency of the graphics processor unit (GPU) of a video card and texture fillrate is obtained by multiplying the number of Texture Mapping Units (TMUs) by the clock frequency of the graphics processing unit (GPU). Texture fillrates are given in mega or gigatexels per second. However, there is no full agreement on how to calculate and report fillrates. Other possible method is: to multiply the number of pixel pipelines by the clock frequency.The results of these multiplications correspond to a theoretical number. The actual fillrate depends on many other factors. In the past, the fillrate has been used as an indicator of performance by video card manufacturers such as ATI and NVIDIA, however, the importance of the fillrate as a measurement of performance has declined as the bottleneck in graphics applications has shifted. For example, today, the number and speed of unified shader processing units has gained attention.|$|R
40|$|The European Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection aims, {{among other}} objectives, {{to ensure a}} {{sustainable}} use of soil. The legal instrument of the strategy, the proposed Framework Directive, suggests identifying priority areas of several soil threats including landslides using a coherent and compatible approach based {{on the use of}} common thematic data. In a first stage, this can be achieved through landslide susceptibility mapping using geographically nested, multi-step tiered approaches, where areas identified as of high susceptibility by a first, synoptic-scale Tier (Tier 1) can then be further assessed and mapped at larger scale by successive Tiers. In order to identify areas prone to landslides at European scale (Tier 1), a number of thematic terrain and environmental data sets already available for the whole of Europe can be used as input for a continental scale susceptibility model. However, since no coherent landslide inventory data is available at the moment over the whole continent, qualitative heuristic zonation approaches are proposed. For Tier 1 a preliminary, simplified model has been developed. It consists of an equally weighting combination of a reduced, continent-wide common dataset of landslide conditioning factors including soil parent material, slope angle and land cover, to derive a landslide susceptibility index using <b>raster</b> mapping <b>units</b> consisting of 1 x 1 km pixels. A preliminary European-wide susceptibility map has thus been produced at 1 : 1 Million scale, since this is compatible with that of the datasets used. The map has been validated by means of a ratio of effectiveness using samples from landslide inventories in Italy, Austria, Hungary and United Kingdom. Although not differentiated for specific geomorphological environments or specific landslide types, the experimental model reveals a relatively good performance in many European regions at a 1 : 1 Million scale. An additional Tier 1 susceptibility map at the same scale and using the same or equivalent thematic data as for the one above has been generated for six French departments using a heuristic, weighting-based multi-criteria evaluation model applied also to raster-cell mapping units. In this experiment, thematic data class weights have been differentiated for two stratification areas, namely mountains and plains, and four main landslide types. Separate susceptibility maps for each landslide type and a combined map for all types have been produced. Results have been validated using BRGM's BDMvT landslide inventory. Unlike Tier 1, Tier 2 assessment requires landslide inventory data and additional thematic data on conditioning factors which may not be available for all European countries. For the Tier 2, a nation-wide quantitative landslide susceptibility assessment has been performed for Italy by applying a statistical model. In this assessment, multivariate analysis was applied using bedrock, soil and climate data together with a number of derivatives from SRTM 90 DEM. In addition, separate datasets from a historical landslide inventory were used for model training and validation respectively. The mapping units selected were based on administrative boundaries (municipalities). The performance of this nation-wide, quantitative susceptibility assessment has been evaluated using multi-temporal landslide inventory data. Finally, model limitations for Tier 1 are discussed, and recommendations for enhanced Tier 1 and Tier 2 models including additional thematic data for conditioning factors are drawn.
