50|$|At {{the time}} of closure the line's sole <b>regular</b> <b>goods</b> <b>service</b> was to the waste {{management}} plant next to Dean Lane railway station {{at the southern end}} of the Oldham Loop. Usually only a single train a day used this facility. Its current operation is unaffected by the conversion to Metrolink.|$|E

5000|$|In {{its final}} years the station {{suffered}} from {{an air of}} neglect, although photographic {{evidence suggests that the}} main buildings were kept in a decent state of repair into the early 1960s. Wimborne station closed to passengers as from 4 May 1964 along with all others on the bypassed original line, an early casualty of the Beeching Axe programme of economies. <b>Regular</b> <b>goods</b> <b>services</b> ceased from 28 February 1966 when sundries were concentrated on Bournemouth Central. This led to a rationalisation of the station's track and signalling for the purposes of dealing with the remaining goods traffic, and from 24 July 1966 [...] "siding working" [...] was introduced whereby the Down line was put out of use and services were concentrated on the former Up line. Signals were removed, but the signalbox remained in service as a ground frame until 8 January 1967 when all points were converted for manual operation.|$|R

50|$|Nanzdietschweiler {{lies on the}} linking {{road through}} the Glan valley between Glan-Münchweiler and Schönenberg-Kübelberg. Bundesstraße 423 runs in a {{straight}} line in the north parallel to this road. The Autobahn interchanges are very favourably placed, with Interchange 8 (Glan-Münchweiler) on the A 62 (Kaiserslautern-Trier) only some 3 km away, Interchange 9 (Hütschenhausen-Katzenbach), also on the A 62, 5 km away and Interchange 11 (Bruchmühlbach-Miesau) on the A 6 (Saarbrücken-Mannheim) only some 10 km away. Formerly, Nanzdietschweiler lay on the so-called strategic railway line between Bad Münster am Stein and Homburg (the Glan Valley Railway or Glantalbahn), which was built in 1904 and abandoned in the 1980s. The nearest railway station nowadays is Glan-Münchweiler station, 5 km away, on the Landstuhl-Kusel railway. The old station in the village ﬁrst bore the name “Dietschweiler-Nanzweiler”, before it was renamed “Dietschweiler” in 1912. In the early 1960s, a halt was opened at Nanzweiler in the hopes of enhancing use of the southern stretch of the line between Homburg and Glan-Münchweiler, but by the late 1970s, the halt was closed. Passenger service ended in 1981, putting an end to all <b>regular</b> trafﬁc, since <b>goods</b> <b>service</b> had already been given up between Schönenberg-Kübelberg and Glan-Münchweiler. In the late 1980s, the tracks were torn up. In 2002, the Glan-Blies-Weg, a cycling and hiking path, was opened on the former trackbed, eventually reaching its full length in 2006.|$|R
