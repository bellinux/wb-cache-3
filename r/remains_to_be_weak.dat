30|$|In the Fifth National Conference on Women and Children in 2011, Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said, ‘Children should <b>be</b> {{the first}} <b>to</b> enjoy the social welfare, {{the last to}} suffer from a disaster’ (Wen 2011). By the end of 2013, China has {{successfully}} completed {{the first phase of}} the Early Childhood Education Three-Year Action Plan, and the kindergarten crunch has been alleviated preliminarily (Ministry of Education of the People’s Republic of China 2014 b). In the past 3 years, the Chinese government attached great importance to equity of ECE and distributed several policies and measures to combat the problems. The government has narrowed the urban-rural differences and has increased rural public-oriented ECE resources rapidly. Moreover, the financial investment for rural areas has increased substantially, and rural kindergarten teachers’ qualification has been enhanced steadily. Overall, rural kindergartens in China have witnessed considerate improvement. However, Chinese rural ECE development is still affected by the late start and the weak foundation. Nowadays, it <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the <b>weakest</b> component of public ECE service system, with several problems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> solved.|$|R
40|$|Aim: The article {{contains}} a personal view of the history {{as well as the}} future of the European Union‟s (EU) health policy. Describing and evaluating the developments on the road from the Treaty of Maastricht to a new Europe it asks and tries to answer the question if weespecially the EU Member States – really know where we want to go to and how to get there. Method: Based on personal experiences, countless EU documents, as well as scientific publications the paper shows the impact EU Health policy has had in the Member States in the past. Historical development: Considering that the legal basis for health has <b>been</b> and <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very <b>weak</b> limiting EU action to support, coordinate, and supplement actions of Member States – which, as a rule, still consider health <b>to</b> <b>be</b> first and foremost a national responsibility and therefore do not want interference from international institutions – the amount and content of EU health activities in the past years has been quite remarkable. Health policy may not be an EU priority and as a crosscutting policy sector it is dominated by many other EU policies. However, especially the “hard law” regulations and directives of the Internal Market give EU the power and competence to achieve health objectives. The size of this growing influence is shown by direct interventions, made possible by the legal acts to improve economic policy coordination. Health and health care in this context are considered as a key policy area for economic growth and EU macroeconomic policy. On the other hand, there isrisk that such regulations affecting health policy  and population health may be dominated too much by economic institutions and their interests, whereas health authorities play onlyminor role to date. Conclusion: For the future of EU health policy it is essential that its position is considerably strengthened, in order to assure that health interests of the EU population are sufficiently safeguarded...|$|R
