We propose that behavioural economics provides a powerful approach to understanding this basic aspect of social attention. We hypothesized that the decision process culminating in attention to another person follows the same economic principles that govern choices about rewards such as food, drinks and money. Specifically, such rewards are discounted {{as a function of}} time, are tradable for other rewards, and <b>reinforce</b> <b>work.</b> Behavioural and neurobiological evidence suggests that looking at other people can also be described as rewarding, but to what extent these economic principles apply to social orienting remains unknown. Here, we show that the opportunity to view pictures of the opposite sex is discounted by delay to viewing, substitutes for money and <b>reinforces</b> <b>work.</b> The reward value of photos of the opposite sex varied with physical attractiveness and was greater in men, suggesting differential utility of acquiring visual information about the opposite sex in men and women. Together, these results demonstrate that choosing whom to look at follows a general set of economic principles, implicating shared neural mechanisms in both social and non-social decision making...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} advances {{theory on}} {{the interplay of}} workplace technological change and features of the employment relationship to inform an active policy debate. In particular, many connect US healthcare's lackluster economic performance [...] both historically and relative to other industries [...] to its apparent reluctance to adopt electronic health record (EHR) systems. Drawing on management and employment relations theory {{as well as a}} multi-method field study of a large-scale healthcare provider, I first demonstrate that performance improvements depend not on the technology per se, but rather on the concomitant adoption of both the information technology (IT) and the rest of its <b>reinforcing</b> <b>work</b> system. In line with prior research, the work system includes workplace-level employment practices like teamwork and training. However, I advance our understanding of these complementarities by showing that their emergence depends on the scope of participatory structures included in the work system. Irrespective of how engaged workers are in the IT initiative, participation only complements the effectiveness of the EHR system where workers could 1.) renegotiate IT-engendered changes in the terms and conditions of employment, and 2.) influence the configuration and deployment of the technology. Based on these findings, IT adoption does not ensure improved performance, implying a shortcoming in policies promoting the diffusion of EHRs rather than the adoption of EHR-inclusive work systems. Drawing once again on both theory and the field study, I propose that only certain medical practices [...] most notably, those that finance patient care on a prepaid or "capitated" basis [...] internalize the benefits of EHR investment. (cont.) Therefore, physicians affiliated with such organizations are more likely to report that their practice adopted the technology along with financial incentives to encourage its optimal use. Those practices whose IT adoption cannot be explained by their business strategy will be less likely to introduce the requisite incentives. Econometric evidence derived from a nationwide sample of physicians finds strong support for these hypotheses. Therefore, this dissertation warns of the imminent decoupling of EHR technology from its work system while advancing management and employment relations theory. by Adam Seth Litwin. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Based on the above argumentation, several important features of UI program – some sharply deviating from an OECD-style program – can be recommended.

50|$|A new {{artificial}} reservoir, Lake Czorsztyn, {{was created}} in 1994 by damming the Dunajec River downstream of the castle. The castle now stands approx. 30 m above the upper water level. The castle hill consists of limestone rock saddled on shale and marl found much below the current bed of the Dunajec River. Studies and analyses show that rock strata forming the limestone bank are weather-resistant, and provide secure foundation for the castle in spite of visible surface deterioration. In order to secure {{the stability of the}} hill, a number of <b>reinforcing</b> <b>works</b> were effected in the strip between the high- and low-water marks.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the effects of State {{regulation}} that determines the extent of professional independence of advanced practice nurses (APNs). We find that in States where APNs have acquired a substantial amount of professional independence, the earnings of APNs are substantially lower, and those of physicians’ assistants (PAs) are substantially higher, than in other States. These results are striking since PAs are in direct competition with APNs; the only real operational difference between these groups is that PAs are salaried employees who must work under the supervision of a physician. The implication is that physicians have responded to an increase in professional independence of APNs by hiring fewer APNs and more PAs. The finding that earnings of APNs decline when they attain more professional autonomy vis-à-vis physicians <b>reinforces</b> <b>work</b> by Sass and Nichols on physical therapists.

40|$|Abstract—Existing {{underground}} pipe jacking methods use a reinforcing rod in a steel tube to obtain structural stiffness. However, some {{problems such as}} inconvenience of works and expensive materials resulted from limited working space and <b>reinforcing</b> <b>works</b> are existed. To resolve these problems, a new pipe jacking method, namely PST (Prestressed Segment Tunnel) method, was developed which used joint to connect the steel segment and form erection structure. For evaluating the flexural capacity of the PST method structure, a experimental test was conducted. The parameters considered in the test were span-to-depth ratio of segment, diameter of steel tube at the corner, prestressing force, and welding of joint. The flexural behaviours with the effect of load capacity in serviceability state according to different parameters were examined [...] The frame with long segments could increase flexural stiffness and the specimen with large diameter of concave corner showed excellent resistance ability to the negative moment. In addition, welding of joints increased the flexural capacity. Keywords—PST method, Pipe jacking method, Flexural behavior, Prestressed concrete...|$|R

The repair work by replacing the deteriorated bearing with seismic-isolation bearing is developed to satisfy the seismic requirement. In this study, optimum design method is developed for seismic-isolation bearing in time of replacing deteriorated bearing in existing bridge. The optimum design problem is formulated to find the size of seismic-isolation bearing considering the constraints related to the fabrication of bearing and performance at ultimate state due to the level 2 earthquakes. The effectiveness and applicability of the method is investigated by applying it to the assumed realistic problem in which the original metal bearing is replaced with the seismic-isolation bearing...|$|R

Research into the effectiveness of homework is inconclusive. Nevertheless, homework serves as a vital link between home and school.
