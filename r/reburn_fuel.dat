In this study, NOx reduction in a CO boiler by reburning is investigated. This study adopts a CO boiler from the Formosa Petrochemical Corporation (FPC) in Taiwan as the model for numerical investigation. It is found that NOx reduction occurs mainly behind the DeNOx section where recirculation is strong. Without reburn air, the size of <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> hole does not significantly influence the NOx reduction, although a larger size is a little better. Without reburn air, a larger <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> hole yields a higher temperature near the <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> hole and leads to a better NO reduction. Injection of <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> without reburn air results in higher CO emission. For a “richer” primary fuel without reburn air, <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> fraction and injection location do not significantly influence the NOx reduction. The reburn air closer to the <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> yields a lower NO emission. Temperature decreases first and arises then near the reburn air injection location. Combustion is more complete when the inlet air flow rate is increased. Increase of inlet air flow rate yields a higher NO emission and a lower CO emission. The cross- sectional average temperature decreases with the inlet air flow rate...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Reburning {{technology}} has been developed to adopt various commercial combustion systems. Fuel lean reburning is an advanced reburning method to reduce NOx economically without using burnout air, however {{it is not easy}} to get high NOx reduction efficiency. In the fuel lean reburning system, the localized fuel rich eddies are used to establish partial fuel rich regions so that the NOx can react with hydrocarbon radical restrictively. In this paper, a new advanced reburning method which supplies <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> with oscillatory motion is introduced to increase NOx reduction rate effectively. To clarify whether forced oscillating injection of <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> can effectively reduce NOx emission, experimental tests were conducted in vertical combustion furnace. Experiments were performed in flames stabilized by a gas burner. The natural gas is used as both main and <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> and total thermal input is about 40 kW. The forced oscillating injection of <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> is realized by electronic solenoid valve, so that fuel rich region and fuel lean region is established alternately. In the fuel rich region, NOx is converted to N 2 by reburning reaction, however unburned hydrocarbon and CO is oxidized in fuel lean zone and mixing zone at downstream where slightly fuel lean region is formed by mixing of two regions. The NOx reduction rate increases up to 41 % by forced oscillating reburn motion. And this paper makes clear that in order to decrease NOx when oscillating <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> injection system is adopted, the control of factors such as frequency and duty ratio is very important...|$|E

Fresh hog manure was processed in a cold-charge, 1 -gal, batch autoclave system at 275 C under a reducing atmosphere in the presence of an alkali catalyst. Instead of the expected organic liquid, the resulting product was a waxy solid material. The waxy nature of the material made size reduction and feeding difficult as the material agglomerated and tended to melt, plugging the feeder. The material was eventually broken up and sized manually and a water-cooled feeder was designed and fabricated. Two reburn tests were performed in a pilot-scale combustor. The first test evaluated a <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> mixture comprising lignite and air-dried, raw hog manure. The second test evaluated a <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> mixture made of lignite and the processed hog manure. Neither <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> reduced NO{sub x} levels in the combustor flue gas.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study on the}} effects of secondary combustion on efficiencies and emission reduction in the diesel engine exhaust heat recovery system has been undertaken. The co-generation concept is utilized in that the electric power is produced by the generator connected to the diesel engine, and heat is recovered from both combustion exhaust gases and the engine by the fin-and-tube and shell-and-tube heat exchangers, respectively. A specially designed secondary combustor is installed at the engine outlet in order to <b>reburn</b> the unburned <b>fuel</b> from the diesel engine, thereby improving the system's efficiency as well as reducing air pollution caused by exhaust gases. The main components of the secondary combustor are coiled Nichrome wires heated by the electric current and diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) housed inside a well insulated stainless steel shell. The performance tests were conducted at four water flow rates of 5, 10, 15 and 20 Â L/min and five electric power outputs of 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 Â kW. The results show that at a water flow of 20 Â L/min and a power generation of 9 Â kW, the total efficiency (thermal efficiency plus electric power generation efficiency) of this system reaches a maximum 94. 4 % which is approximately 15 - 20 % higher than that of the typical diesel engine exhaust heat recovery system. Besides, the use of the secondary combustor and heat exchangers results in 80 %, 35 % and 90 % reduction of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particulate matter (PM), respectively.

In order to control these emissions without major {{modifications to the}} burners, additional fuel called <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> is fired under rich conditions (10 - 30 % by heat) after the coal burners. Additional air called overfire air (about 20 % of total air) is injected in order to complete combustion. Typically <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> is natural gas (NG). From previous research at TAMU, {{it was found that}} firing feedlot biomass (FB) as <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> lowers the NOx emission at significant levels compared to NG. The present research was conducted to determine the optimum operating conditions for the reduction of NOx. Experiments were performed in a small scale 29. 3 kW (100, 000 BTU/hr) reactor using low ash partially composted FB (LA PC FB) with equivalence ratio ranging from 1 to 1. 15.

40|$|Reburn {{with animal}} waste yield NO{sub x} {{reduction}} {{of the order of}} 70 - 80 %, which is much higher than those previously reported in the literature for natural gas, coal and agricultural biomass as reburn fuels. Further, the NO{sub x} reduction is almost independent of stoichiometry from stoichiometric to upto 10 % deficient air in reburn zone. As a first step towards understanding the reburn process in a boiler burner, a simplified zero-dimensional model has been developed for estimating the NO{sub x} reduction in the reburn process using simulated animal waste based biomass volatiles. However the first model does not include the gradual heat up of <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> particle, pyrolysis and char combustion. Hence {{there is a need for}} more rigorous treatment of the model with animal waste as <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel.</b> To address this issue, an improved zero-dimensional model is being developed which can handle any solid <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel,</b> along with more detailed heterogeneous char reactions and homogeneous global reactions. The model on ''NO{sub x} Reduction for Reburn Process using Feedlot Biomass,'' incorporates; (a) mixing between <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> and main-burner gases, (b) gradual heat-up of <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> accompanied by pyrolysis, oxidation of volatiles and char oxidation, (c) fuel-bound nitrogen (FBN) pyrolysis, and FBN including both forward and backward reactions, (d) prediction of NO{sub x} as a function of time in the reburn zone, and (e) gas phase and solid phase temperature as a function of time.

Fuel Lean Biomass Reburning is a method of staging fuel within a coal-fired utility boiler to convert nitrogen oxides (NOx) to nitrogen by creating locally fuel-rich eddies, which favor the reduction of NOx, within an overall fuel lean boiler. These eddies are created by injecting a supplemental fuel source, designated as the <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel,</b> downstream of the primary combustion zone. Chopped biomass was the <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> for this project.

40|$|Abstract: From {{the view}} of the {{environmental}} protection against the usage of fos-sil fuels, a great amount of effort has been exerted to find an effective method that is not only for pollutant reduction, but also for higher thermal efficiency. In order to enhance combustion efficiency, oxygen-enriched combustion is used by increasing the oxygen ratio in the oxidizer. However, since the flame temperature increases, NOx formation in the furnace seriously increases for low oxygen enrich-ment ratio. In this case reburning is a useful technology for reducing nitric oxide through injection of a secondary hydrocarbon fuel. In this article, an experimental study has been conducted to evaluate the hybrid effects of reburning and selective non-catalytic reaction (SNCR) on NOx=CO formation and also to examine heat transfer characteristics in an oxygen-enriched LPG flame. Experiments were per-formed in flames stabilized by a co-flow swirl burner, which was mounted {{at the bottom of the}} furnace. Tests were conducted using LPG gas as the <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> as well as the main fuel. The effects of <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> fraction and injection location of the <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> as well as SNCR agent were studied. The paper reports data on flue gas emissions, temperature distribution in the furnace and various heat fluxes at the wall for a wide range of experimental conditions. At steady state, the total heat flux from the flame to the wall of the furnace has been measured using a heat flux sensor. Temperature distribution and emission formation in the furnace have also been measured and compared. Overall temperature in the furnace, heat fluxes to the wall and NOx generation were observed to increase with low leve...|$|E
40|$|Fuel-Lean Gas Reburning(TM) (FLGR) is {{a method}} of {{controlling}} NO x emissions produced during coal combustion in utility boilers by injecting natural gas into the boiler downstream of the primary combustion zone.

40|$|Oxides of {{nitrogen}} from coal-fired power stations {{are considered to}} be major pollutants, and there is increasing concern for regulating air quality and offsetting the emissions generated from the use of energy. Reburning is an in-furnace, combustion control technology for NOx reduction. Another environmental issue {{that needs to be addressed}} is the rapidly growing feedlot industry in the United States. The production of biomass from one or more animal species is in excess of what can safely be applied to farmland in accordance with nutrient management plans and stockpiled waste poses economic and environmental liabilities. In the present study, the feasibility of using biomass as a <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> in existing coal-fired power plants is considered. It is expected to utilize biomass as a low-cost, substitute fuel and an agent to control emission. The successful development of this technology will create environment-friendly, low cost fuel source for the power industry, provide means for an alternate method of disposal of biomass, and generate a possible revenue source for feedlot operators. In the present study, the effect of coal, cattle manure or feedlot biomass, and blends of biomass with coal on the ability to reduce NOx were investigated in the Texas A&M University 29. 31 kW (100, 000 Btu/h) reburning facility. The facility used a mixture of propane and ammonia to generate the 600 ppm NOx in the primary zone. The <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> was injected using air. The stoichiometry tested were 1. 00 to 1. 20 in the reburn zone. Two types of injectors, circular jet and fan spray injectors, which produce different types of mixing within the reburn zone, were studied to find their effect on NOx emissions reduction. The flat spray injector performed better in all cases. With the injection of biomass as <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> with circular jet injector the maximum NOx reduction was 29. 9 % and with flat spray injector was 62. 2 %.

40|$|Coal fired {{power plants}} will face many {{challenges}} {{in the near future}} as new regulations, such as the Clear Sky Act, are being implemented. These regulations impose much stricter limits on NOx emissions and plan to impose limits on mercury emissions from coal fired boilers. At this time no technologies are currently being implemented for control of Hg and this explains the strong interest in this area by the Department of Energy (DOE). Reburn technology is a very promising technology to reduce NOx emissions. Previous experimental research at TAMU reported that Feedlot Biomass (FB) can be a very effective <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel,</b> for reduction of NOx up to 90 %- 95 %; however, little work has been done to model such a process with Feedlot Biomass as <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel.</b> The present work addresses the development of a reburn model to predict NOx and Hg emissions. The model accounts for finite rate of heating of solid fuel particles, mixing with NOx laden hot gases, size distribution, finite gas phase and heterogeneous chemistry, and oxidation and reduction reactions for NOx and Hg. To reduce the computational effort all the reactions, except those involved in mercury oxidation, are modeled using global reactions. Once the model was validated by comparison with experimental findings, extensive parametric studies were performed to evaluate the parameters controlling NOx reduction. From DOE research programs some experimental data regarding the capture of mercury from power plant is available, but currently no experimental data are available for Hg emission with reburn process. This model has shown a very large mercury reduction using biomass as a <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel.</b> The model recommends the following correlations for optimum reduction of NOx: Equivalence Ratio should be above 1. 05; mixing time should be below 100 ms (especially for biomass); pure air can be used as the carrier gas; the thermal power fraction of the reburner should be between 15 % and 25 %; residence time should be at least 0. 5 s and the Surface Mean Diameter (SMD) of the size distribution should be as small as possible, at least below 100 ?m...|$|E
40|$|Cattle biomass (CB) {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a renewable, supplementary fuel for co-firing and reburning. Reburning coal with CB {{has the potential to}} reduce NOx and Hg emissions from coal fired systems. The present research focuses on three areas of combustion: 1) Biomass reburning experiments are conducted to determine the optimum operating conditions for the NOx reduction using blends of coal and CB as reburn fuels. 2) Since CB contains higher ash contents compared to coals, the fouling behavior is also investigated under the transient and short-time operation. 3) Finally CB contains higher Cl compared to coals, which oxidizes Hg to HgCl 2. To understand the Hg oxidation behavior, a fundamental study of Hg oxidation in coal combustion is conducted using a plug flow reactor (PFR). The main parameters investigated are types of the <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel,</b> reburn equivalence ratios (ERRBZ), O 2 concentrations in the reburn gas, injection angles of the <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel,</b> cross-sectional geometries of the reburn nozzles, symmetric and asymmetric reburn injections, reburn heat inputs, baseline NOx concentrations, and presence and absence of the heat exchangers (HEX). The results of reburning show that CB is a very effective fuel in NOx reduction, and the extent of NOx reduction is strongly dependent to the ERRBZ. The optimum conditions of the boiler operation for biomass reburning are as follows: ERRBZ = 1. 1, 45 ? upward circular reburn nozzles, 12. 5 % O 2 in the reburn gas, symmetric injection, and presence of HEXs. To make an effective reburn process, the baseline NOx concentrations must be higher than 230 g/GJ (0. 5 lb/mmBTU) and the reburn heat input higher than 20 %. The results of ash fouling show the presence of ash in the hotter region of the furnace seems to promote heat radiation thus augmenting the heat transfer to the HEX. The growth of the layer of ash depositions over longer periods typically lowers overall heat transfer coefficients. The addition of HCl to Hg containing gases in the PFR significantly increases Hg oxidations. The addition of NO inhibited the overall reaction and shifted the reaction temperature higher while the addition of O 2 promoted Hg oxidations and lowered the reaction temperature. For heterogeneous cases, the use of the VWT catalyst promotes the reduction of Hg 0 and shifted the reaction temperatures lower than those for homogeneous cases...|$|E

40|$|Intensive {{animal feeding}} {{operations}} create {{large amounts of}} animal waste that must be safely disposed of {{in order to avoid}} environmental degradation. Cattle feedlots and chicken houses are two examples. In feedlots, cattle are confined to small pens and fed a high calorie grain-diet diet in preparation for slaughter. In chicken houses, thousands of chickens are kept in close proximity. In both of these operations, millions of tons of manure are produced every year. The manure {{could be used as a}} fuel by mixing it with coal in a 90 : 10 blend and firing it in an existing coal suspension fired combustion systems. This technique is known as co-firing, and the high temperatures produced by the coal will allow the biomass to be completely combusted. Reburn is a process where a small percentage of fuel called <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> is injected above the NO{sub x} producing, conventional coal fired burners in order to reduce NO{sub x}. The manure could also be used as <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> for reducing NO{sub x} in coal fired plants. An alternate approach of using animal waste is to adopt the gasification process using a fixed bed gasifier and then use the gases for firing in gas turbine combustors. In this report, the cattle manure is referred to as feedlot biomass (FB) and chicken manure as litter biomass (LB). The report generates data on FB and LB fuel characteristics. Co-firing, reburn, and gasification tests of coal, FB, LB, coal: FB blends, and coal: LB blends and modeling on cofiring, reburn systems and economics of use of FB and LB have also been conducted. The biomass fuels are higher in ash, lower in heat content, higher in moisture, and higher in nitrogen and sulfur (which can cause air pollution) compared to coal. Small-scale cofiring experiments revealed that the biomass blends can be successfully fired, and NO{sub x} emissions will be similar to or lower than pollutant emissions when firing coal. Further experiments showed that biomass is twice or more effective than coal when used in a reburning process. Computer simulations for coal: LB blends were performed by modifying an existing computer code to include the drying and phosphorus (P) oxidation models. The gasification studies revealed that there is bed agglomeration in the case of chicken litter biomass due to its higher alkaline oxide content in the ash. Finally, the results of the economic analysis show that considerable fuel cost savings can be achieved with the use of biomass. In the case of higher ash and moisture biomass, the fuel cost savings is reduced...|$|E

The second generation AR systems incorporate several components {{which can be used}} in different combinations. These components include: (1) Reburning Injection of the <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> and overfire air. (2) N-agent Injection The N-agent (ammonia or urea) can be injected at different locations: into the reburning zone, along with the overfire air, and downstream of the overfire air injection. (3) N-agent Promotion Several sodium compounds can considerably enhance the NO{sub x} control from N-agent injection. These ''promoters'' can be added to aqueous N-agents. (4) Two Stages of N-agent Injection and Promotion Two N-agents with or without promoters can be injected at different locations for deeper NO{sub x} control. AR systems are intended for post-RACT applications in ozone non-attainment areas where NO{sub x} control in excess of 80 % is required. AR will provide flexible installations that allow NO{sub x} levels to be lowered when regulations become more stringent. The total cost of NO{sub x} control for AR systems is approximately half of that for SCR. Experimental and kinetic modeling results for development of these novel AR systems are presented. Tests have been conducted in a 1. 0 MMBtu/hr Boiler Simulator Facility with coal as the main fuel and natural gas as the reburning fuel. The results show that high efficiency NO{sub x} control, in the range 84 - 95 %, can be achieved with various elements of AR. A comparative byproduct emission study was performed to compare the emissions from different variants of AR with commercial technologies (reburning and SNCR). For each technology sampling included: CO, SO{sub 2 }, N{sub 2 }O, total hydrocarbons, NH{sub 3 }, HCN, SO{sub 3 }, fly ash mass loading and size distribution, PM 10, and carbon in ash. AR technologies do not generate significant byproduct emissions in comparison with basic reburning and SNCR processes under similar conditions. In most cases, byproduct emissions were found to be lower for the AR technologies. Kinetic modeling predictions qualitatively explain the experimental trends observed in the combustion tests.

Consequently, there is an urgent need to find a mass disposal route for tyres. We describe, in this paper, a novel use for tyre rubber pulverised fuel in a NOx reburning process which may have an application in power station boilers. This method of disposal could represent a way of combining waste disposal, energy recovery and pollution control within one process. A preliminary study of micronised tyre combustion was undertaken to identify the suitable size ranges for application in NOx reduction by reburning. Tests were performed in a down-fired, pulverised fuel combustor (PFC) operating at about 80 kW. Superior combustion characteristics, i. e. burnout were achieved with particle sizes less than 250 μm. A South African coal was used as the primary fuel in the reburn tests and the tyre was fed pneumatically via a separate feed system. Parameters studied, were, reburn zone stoichiometry and <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> fraction. Additionally, the carbon content of the ash was carefully monitored for any effect on burnout at the fuel rich reburn stoichiometries. The NOx reductions achieved with tyres are compared with reburning with coal. NOx reductions up to 80...|$|E
40|$|During this quarter, {{the focus}} was on getting the {{experimental}} facility ready for operation. Upon receiving all the pieces of equipment, the research team first {{spent a great deal of}} time in calibration of various instruments and then began assembling the pieces for the experimental work. The use of Swage-lock fittings helped in arresting the gas leaks fairly easily. The entire assembly consisted of teflon tube connections (a) from gas cylinders to the flow meters, manifold and buffer vessel, (b) from buffer vessel to the inlet of the reactor enclosed in the middle, by a furnace, (c) from the exhaust end of the reactor to the NOx analyzer via gas dryer and (d) from the analyzer to the vent. Details of the experimental setup are given in the subsequent section. Once the setup was checked for leaks and the leaks were arrested, the facility was operational. Several experiments on NO reburning with methane were undertaken. The flow rates for various gases were calculated for five reburning stoichiometric ratios and the experiments were conducted for three different reaction temperatures. The results are presented later on in this report. These results indicate favorable reduction of NO by reburning with methane, consistent with their computer projections, and hence, present a good base for investigating further on nitric oxide reburning with other fuels as well. Experiments on nitric oxide reburning with (1) a combination of methane and acetylene, and (2) a combination of methane and ammonia, will be considered in the next quarter. The computer simulation results submitted in the Second Quarterly Report indicate further reduction of NO with the addition of acetylene/ammonia to methane as <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel.</b> These results will be verified experimentally in the ensuing quarter...|$|E
40|$|New {{regulations}} {{like the}} Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) will pose greater challenges for Coal fired power plants {{with regards to}} pollution reduction. These new regulations plan to impose stricter limits on NOX reduction. The current regulations by themselves already require cleanup technology; newer regulations will require development of new and economical technologies. Using a blend of traditional fuels & biomass is a promising technology to reduce NOX emissions. Experiments conducted previously at the Coal and Biomass energy lab at Texas A&M reported that dairy biomass {{can be an effective}} <b>Reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> with NOX reduction of up to 95 %; however little work has been done to model such a process with Feedlot Biomass as a blend with the main burner fuel. The present work concerns with development of a zero dimensional for a low NOx burner (LNB) model in order to predict NOX emissions while firing a blend of Coal and dairy biomass. Two models were developed. Model I assumes that the main burner fuel is completely oxidized to CO,CO 2,H 20 and fuel bound nitrogen is released as HCN, NH 3, N 2; these partially burnt product mixes with tertiary air, undergoes chemical reactions specified by kinetics and burns to complete combustion. Model II assumes that the main burner solid fuel along with primary and secondary air mixes gradually with recirculated gases, burn partially and the products from the main burner include partially burnt solid particles and fuel bound nitrogen partially converted to N 2, HCN and NH 3. These products mix gradually with tertiary air, undergo further oxidation-reduction reactions in order to complete the combustion. The results are based on model I. Results from the model were compared with experimental findings to validate it. Results from the model recommend the following conditions for optimal reduction of NOx: Equivalence Ratio should be above 0. 95; mixing time should be below 100 ms. Based on Model I, results indicate that increasing percentage of dairy biomass in the blend increases the NOx formation due to the assumption that fuel N compounds (HCN, NH 3) do not undergo oxidation in the main burner zone. Thus it is suggested that model II must be adopted in the future work...|$|E
40|$|Manure-based biomass (MBB) has the {{potential}} to be a source of green energy at large coal-fired power plants and on smaller-scale combustion systems at or near confined animal feeding operations. Although MBB is a low quality fuel with an inferior heat value compared to coal and other fossil fuels, the concentration of it at large animal feeding operations can make it a viable source of fuel. Mathematical models were developed to portray the economics of co-firing and reburning coal with MBB. A base case run of the co-fire model in which a 95 : 5 blend of coal to low-ash MBB was burned at an existing 300 -MWe coal-fired power plant was found to have an overall net present cost of $ 22. 6 million. The most significant cost that hindered the profitability of the co-fire project was the cost of operating gas boilers for biomass dryers that were required to reduce the MBB's moisture content before transportation and combustion. However, a higher dollar value on avoided nonrenewable CO 2 emissions could overrule exorbitant costs of drying and transporting the MBB to power plants. A CO 2 value of $ 17 /metric ton was found to be enough for the MBB co-fire project to reach an economic break-even point. Reburning coal with MBB to reduce NOx emissions can theoretically be more profitable than a co-fire project, due to the value of avoided NOx emissions. However, the issue of finding enough suitable low-ash biomass becomes problematic for reburn systems since the <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> must supply 10 to 25 % of the power plant?s heat rate in order to achieve the desired NOx level. A NOx emission value over $ 2500 /metric ton would justify installing a MBB reburn system. A base case run of a mathematical model describing a small-scale, on-the-farm MBB combustion system that can completely incinerate high-moisture (over 90 %) manure biomass was developed and completed. If all of the energy or steam produced by the MBB combustion system were to bring revenue to the animal feeding operation either by avoided fueling costs or by sales, the conceptualized MBB combustion system has {{the potential}} to be a profitable venture...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The Texas Panhandle is {{regarded}} as the âCattle Feeding Capital of the Worldâ, producing 42 % of the fed beef cattle in the United States within a 200 -mile radius of Amarillo generating more than 5 million tons of feedlot manure /year. Apart from feedlots, the Bosque River Region in Erath County, just north of Waco, Texas with about 110, 000 dairy cattle in over 250 dairies, produces 1. 8 million tons of manure biomass (excreted plus bedding) per year. While the feedlot manure has been used extensively for irrigated and dry land crop production, most dairies, as well as other concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOâs), the dairy farms utilize large lagoon areas to store wet animal biomass. Water runoff from these lagoons has been held responsible for the increased concentration of phosphorus and other contaminates in the Bosque River which drains into Lake Wacoâthe primary source of potable water for Wacoâs 108, 500 people. The concentrated animal feeding operations may lead to land, water, and air pollution if waste handling systems and storage and treatment structures are not properly managed. Manure-based biomass (MBB) {{has the potential to be}} a source of green energy at large coal-fired power plants and on smaller-scale combustion systems at or near confined animal feeding operations. Although MBB particularly cattle biomass (CB) is a low quality fuel with an inferior heat value compared to coal and other fossil fuels, the concentration of it at large animal feeding operations can make it a viable source of fuel. The overall objective of this interdisciplinary proposal is to develop environmentally benign technologies to convert low-value inventories of dairy and beef cattle biomass into renewable energy. Current research expands the suite of technologies by which cattle biomass (CB: manure, and premature mortalities) could serve as a renewable alternative to fossil fuel. The work falls into two broad categories of research and development. Category 1 â Renewable Energy Conversion. This category addressed mostly in volume I involves developing. Thermo-chemical conversion technologies including cofiring with coal, reburn to reduce nitrogen oxide (NO, N 2 O, NOx, etc.) and Hg emissions and gasification to produce low-BTU gas for on-site power production in order to extract energy from waste streams or renewable resources. Category 2 â Biomass Resource Technology. This category, addressed mostly in Volume II, deals with the efficient and cost-effective use of CB as a renewable energy source (e. g. through and via aqueous-phase, anaerobic digestion or biological gasification). The investigators formed an industrial advisory panel consisting fuel producers (feedlots and dairy farms) and fuel users (utilities), periodically met with them, and presented the research results; apart from serving as dissemination forum, the PIs used their critique to red-direct the research within the scope of the tasks. The final report for the 5 to 7 year project performed by an interdisciplinary team of 9 professors is arranged in three volumes: Vol. I (edited by Kalyan Annamalai) addressing thermo-chemical conversion and direct combustion under Category 1 and Vol. II and Vol. III (edited by J M Sweeten) addressing biomass resource Technology under Category 2. Various tasks and sub-tasks addressed in Volume I were performed by the Department of Mechanical Engineering (a part of TEES; see Volume I), while other tasks and sub-tasks addressed in Volume II and IIII were conducted by Texas AgriLife Research at Amarillo; the TAMU Biological & Agricultural Engineering Department (BAEN) College Station; and West Texas A&M University (WTAMU) (Volumes II and III). The three volume report covers the following results: fuel properties of low ash and high ash CB (particularly DB) and MB (mortality biomass and coals, non-intrusive visible infrared (NVIR) spectroscopy techniques for ash determination, dairy energy use surveys at 14 dairies in Texas and California, cofiring of low quality CB with high quality coal, emission results and ash fouling behavior, using CB as <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel</b> for NOx and Hg reduction, gasification of fuels to produce low quality gases, modeling of reburn, pilot scale test results, synthesis of engineering characterization, geographical mapping, a transportation cost study to determine potential handling and transportation systems for co-firing with coal at regional coal-fired power plants, software analyses for the design of off-site manure, pre-processing and storage systems for a typical dairy farm or beef cattle feedlot, recursive production functions/systems models for both cattle feedlots, systems modeling, stocks and flows of energy involved in the CAFO system, feedback from an Industry Advisory Committee (IAC) to the investigators on project direction and task emphasis and economics of using CB as cofiring and <b>reburn</b> <b>fuel...</b>|$|E
