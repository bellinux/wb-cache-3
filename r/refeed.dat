5000|$|A CKD {{offers a}} way to combat this. It offers a {{cyclical}} [...] "refeed" [...] (sometimes also called a carb-up). During this phase, the diet consists mostly of complex carbohydrates, with limited fat, sucrose and fructose. Since the glycogen stores in the liver and muscles are depleted, these carbohydrates go straight to refilling them, instead of being added to the body's fat stores. For this reason, the amount of calories consumed during a <b>refeed</b> can be far above an individual's usual dietary intake. While a typical CKD consists of 50g or less carbs per day, the typical <b>refeed</b> consists of 450-600g of carbs. Also a weight gain of 1-2 lbs is usually reported during refeeding.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify and describe different dietary strategies used by bodybuilders, their rationale, and the sources of information from which these strategies are gathered. In-depth interviews were conducted with seven experienced (10. 4 ± 3. 4 years bodybuilding experience), male, natural bodybuilders. Participants were asked about training, dietary and supplement practices, and information resources for bodybuilding strategies. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. During the off-season, energy intake was higher and less restricted than during the in-season to aid in muscle hypertrophy. There was a focus on high protein intake with adequate carbohydrate to permit high training loads. To create an energy deficit and loss of fat mass, energy intake was gradually and progressively reduced during the in-season via a reduction in carbohydrate and fat intake. The rationale for weekly higher carbohydrate <b>refeed</b> days was to offset declines in metabolic rate and fatigue, while in the final “peak week” before competition, the reasoning for fluid and sodium manipulation and carbohydrate loading was to enhance the appearance of leanness and vascularity. Other bodybuilders, coaches and the internet were significant sources of information. Despite the common perception of extreme, non-evidence-based regimens, these bodybuilders reported predominantly using strategies which are recognized as evidence-based, developed over many years of experience.

Fifty-seven rats were divided into six groups, having 6 to 11 rats. Food was provided ad-libitum until three months and then the first group was considered without starvation (day 0). Other rats were fasted for two weeks. Group 2 was applied to a group immediately after starvation (day 14). Groups 3 to 6 were refed in days 16 till 22, respectively. At the end of each period, blood and tissue samples were taken and histopathological and serum analysis, including serum electrolytes (calcium, phosphorus, sodium, potassium), the energy parameters (glucose, insulin, cortisol) and the liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP) were determined. Insulin decreased by starvation and then showed an increasing trend compared to starvation period, which the highest amount of this parameter was observed eight days post-refeeding. Serum glucose level showed the opposite pattern of insulin. Histopathological examination of the tissue sections revealed clear vacuoles after starvation and <b>refeeding,</b> in which the severity of lesions gradually decreased during <b>refeeding.</b> The cortisol level decreased by starvation and then increased during <b>refeeding.</b> Also, potassium and phosphorus concentrations declined by <b>refeeding</b> and the serum sodium and potassium levels were changed in the relatively opposite manner.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the patterns of recovery time between the weigh-in and the first combats during judo competitions. One hundred and seventeen juvenile, junior and senior male athletes were analyzed during two São Paulo state competitions. The time at which each athlete has finished the weight-in and the time at which they have started the first combat were recorded and then the recovery period between weigh-in and combats was calculated. Average recovery time was approximately four hours. Most athletes had a 2. 5 to 5 -hour recovery time between the weigh-in and the first combat. Senior athletes had a significant longer recovery time compared to junior and juvenile (p < 0. 001). Junior athletes also had a significant longer recovery time in comparison to juvenile athletes (p < 0. 001). In conclusion, the patterns for recovery time presented in this study are likely to be a standard if competitions of similar size and organization are considered. Recovery period for the majority of athletes is enough to allow them to <b>refeed</b> and rehydrate, so the impact of weight loss on performance would be minimal.

Aim: To evaluate criteria that may guide in early <b>refeeding</b> avoiding unnecesary prolonged fasting. Patients and methods: Thirty patients with acute pancreatitis were evaluated in a prospective trial. The severity of the pancreatitis was evaluated according to APACHE II score and Balthazar CT scan altertions. The criteria proposed to start early <b>refeeding</b> were abscence of nausea and vomiting, decreased abdominal pain, presence of bowel sounds and lowering of serum amylase levels. Balthazar CT scan clasification, was used to decide between oral or enteral <b>refeeding.</b> Results. Eighty percent of patients had alterations in pancreatic density, necrosis or pancretic or peripancreatic liquid collections in the CT scan (correspondig to Balthazar stages C,D,or E).

30|$|If the {{expression}} of myostatin was high, it would explain the relatively low expression of MyoD in fasted treatments. However, in our study, skeletal muscle myostatin levels were not different in Nile tilapia juveniles between fasted and control fish throughout the experiment. A long-term study of fasting in adult tilapia also showed that myostatin expression was unaffected by fasting (Rodgers et al. 2003) Our {{findings suggest that the}} level of starvation in these juveniles was enough to activate an alternative mechanism for regulating muscle growth rather than through myostatin. In rainbow trout deprived of food for 10  weeks and <b>refeed</b> for 34  days, the myostatin expression, similar to our findings, was not significantly changed during the experiment (Chauvigne et al. 2003). However, in tilapia fingerlings (0.6  g), myostatin expression was upregulated after 5  days of fasting in comparison to the fed control; nonetheless, after refeeding no differences were detected (Nebo et al. 2013). Likewise in another study performed with tilapia in larval phase, myostatin mRNA levels were upregulated by fasting and then reduced during refeeding (Rodgers et al. 2003). Taken into consideration the above, these results suggest that the degree of catabolism induced by fasting in tilapia is greater in larvae and fingerlings, likely due to lower body reserves, than in juvenile and adult fish that have more energy storage, and thus a higher capacity to tolerate fasting conditions.|$|E

We have transmitted L. tropica to golden hamsters and BALB/c mice by the bite of P. sergenti. Sand flies and Leishmania both originated from an anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis focus in Urfa, Turkey. P. sergenti females from a laboratory colony were infected by feeding on lesions of needle-inoculated hamsters or mice. Gravid females were allowed to <b>refeed</b> on uninfected hosts 9 – 15 d after the infective feeding. At the second feeding, some infected females took a full blood meal, while others only a partial one; some females failed to feed at all. The ability of infected females to take a blood meal did not correlate with the parasite transmissibility. In four BALB/c mice, lesions developed after 1 – 6 months. In two albino hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), lesions developed 1 month after the infective feeding, and Leishmania could be reisolated from these sites. Another hamster did not develop a lesion; however, the feeding site and the adjacent ear were PCR positive 1 year after infective feeding.

This was accompanied by increased hepatic type III deiodinase (D 3) and decreased renal D 3 activity. There were no changes in hepatic or renal type I deiodinase (D 1). <b>Refeeding</b> restored normal plasma T(3), T(4), and TSH levels, while hepatic D 3 and renal D 3 activities returned to prefasting levels. Again hepatic D 1 was not affected, but renal D 1 was lower than the ad libitum values during the entire <b>refeeding</b> period. These results confirm that liver D 3 is involved in the regulation of plasma T(3) during fasting and <b>refeeding</b> in the chicken. Northern blot analysis demonstrated increased hepatic D 3 mRNA levels during the first day of starvation that disappeared by the end of the second day; <b>refeeding</b> had no additional effects.

40|$|International audienceThe {{trade-off}} between reproductive {{effort and}} adult survival in birds is modulated by several factors. Corticosterone and prolactin have additive effects on reproductive behaviour by stimulating foraging and parental behaviours, respectively. When incubation {{is associated with}} fasting, nest desertion {{is supposed to be}} activated by an unknown refeeding signal when body condition becomes critically deteriorated. The concomitant rise in corticosterone levels has been suggested to be the triggering factor. We tested the role of corticosterone on reproductive success by observing the effect of corticosterone implants on reproductive success and on plasma prolactin concentration in female common eiders Somateria mollissima. Implanted females showed a significant increase in corticosterone and a decrease in prolactin levels. Despite their enhanced daily body mass loss, females did not abandon incubation nor did they start to <b>refeed</b> in the four days following implantation. These data show that the experimentally induced rise in plasma corticosterone concentration alone does not trigger nest desertion. However, after 25 days of incubation, implanted females displayed a higher rate of egg loss, suggesting lower nest attentiveness towards the end of incubation. We suggest that the short-term effects of corticosterone may be dependent on the energy state of the bird. However, the late-induced change in reproductive success is indirectly linked to corticosterone, and we suggest that either a prolactin decrease, or a depletion in protein body reserves, may participate in the longterm adjustment of incubation behaviour in female eiders...|$|E
40|$|Background Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a {{disorder}} recognized by underweight and psychiatric symptoms, and some patients {{are at risk}} of developing refeeding syndrome (RFS). AN patients may experience metabolic disturbances and severe symptoms during refeeding, and international guidelines in how to <b>refeed</b> AN patients at risk of RFS varies. The regional departments of eating disorders (EDs) in Norway treat about 100 - 200 patients every year with AN, and a survey investigating procedures have not been performed before. Aim This master thesis has investigated how physicians and registered dietitians (RDs) in the departments of EDs in Norway consider RFS, and how they <b>refeed</b> and monitor patients with AN. Due to the complications and problems that may occur during refeeding in high-risk groups like AN, it was of interest to investigate if procedures, knowledge and awareness varied between the ED units and if the basic reference menu at RASP contain the energy and micronutrients that is recommended for AN patients during refeeding. Method Procedures, questionnaires and analysis of the basic reference menu at RASP have been collected and analyzed. The procedures were collected by contacting the head physicians at the different regional departments of EDs by mail. The master student designed the questionnaire, with assistance from the RDs and supervisor at RASP. The four-week rollover dinner menu at RASP was weighed, photographed and nutritional content calculated. The average nutrient content of the dinners was analyzed together with the other meals (breakfast, lunch, and evening meal) in the basic menu/ and half of the basic menu to evaluate the yield of important nutrients trough one day. Results Three out of six regional departments of EDs have a procedure to identify and/or treat patients at risk of RFS. Initial refeeding range of energy in the procedures varied between 10 - 30 kcal/kg/body weight, or half dietary lists (1000 - 1500 kcal). RFS is a rare syndrome in the ED III units. Only one clinician at one of the ED units had ever seen a patient with full-blown RFS. The basic reference menu at RASP covers the recommendations of most nutrients. Half basic reference menu contains more energy than most international guidelines recommended for patients at risk of RFS. The energy contents in dinner portions in the basic reference menu contain an average of about 480 kcal. Conclusion The procedures of RFS vary between the regional departments of EDs in Norway. A closer collaboration between the units may be favorable, and all units ought to have procedures to identify and treat patients at risk of RFS. The knowledge and awareness of RFS among physicians and RDs working at an ED unit in Norway are good. However, the questionnaire detected that there are some uncertainties both among the physicians and RDs about the definition of RFS. The energy prescribed in Halv grunnmeny" is higher than most of the international guidelines for initial refeeding of patients at risk of RFS. The basic reference menu makes an important frame for and is a good guidance for the milieu therapists that serve the patients during the nutritional rehabilitation at RASP.

WNV-positive stable flies were observed feeding en masse on incapacitated, WNV-positive pelicans, arousing suspicions that the flies could {{have been involved in}} WNV transmission among pelicans, and perhaps to livestock and humans. We assessed biological transmission by infecting stable flies intrathoracically with WNV and testing them at 2 -d intervals over 20 d. Infectious WNV was detected in fly bodies in decreasing amounts over time for only the first 6 d post infection, an indication that WNV did not replicate within fly tissues and that stable flies cannot biologically transmit WNV. We assessed mechanical transmission using a novel technique. Specifically, we fed WNV-infected blood to individual flies by using a cotton swab (i. e., artificial donor), and at intervals of 1 min- 24 h, we allowed flies to <b>refeed</b> on a different swab saturated with WNV-negative blood (i. e., artificial recipient). Flies mechanically transmitted viable WNV from donor to recipient swabs for up to 6 h post infection, with the majority of the transmission events occurring within the first hour.

Over a 6 -year period, we encountered three cases of <b>refeeding</b> hypophosphatemia in malnourished children admitted to a pediatric rehabilitation hospital. Two children had neurologic dysphagia and one had been starved by an abusive parent. The one patient who was symptomatic had obtundation, hemolytic anemia, rhabdomyolysis, and hepatocellular injury that began during <b>refeeding</b> and resolved with treatment. The signs and symptoms, pathophysiology, and treatment of <b>refeeding</b> hypophosphatemia are reviewed. Clin Pediatr. 1998; 37 : 347 - 35...|$|R
50|$|<b>Refeeding</b> {{syndrome}} can {{be fatal}} if not recognized and treated properly. An awareness of the condition and a high index of suspicion are {{required in order to}} make the diagnosis. The electrolyte disturbances of the <b>refeeding</b> syndrome can occur within the first few days of <b>refeeding.</b> Close monitoring of blood biochemistry is therefore necessary in the early <b>refeeding</b> period. In critically ill patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit, if phosphate drops to below 0.65 mmol from a previously normal level within three days of starting enteral or parenteral nutrition, caloric intake should be reduced to 480 kcals per day for at least two days whilst electrolytes are replaced. Prescribing thiamine, vitamin B complex (strong) and a multivitamin and mineral preparation is recommended. Biochemistry should be monitored regularly until it is stable. Although clinical trials are lacking in patients other than those admitted to an intensive care, it is commonly recommended that energy intake should remain lower than that normally required for the first 3-5 days of treatment of <b>refeeding</b> syndrome. Patients who have been starved for some time often experience gastrointestinal disturbance during <b>refeeding,</b> in particular colicky abdominal pain, reflux symptoms, nausea, and early satiety.|$|R
40|$|SummarySestrins (Sesns) protect {{cells from}} {{oxidative}} stress. The mechanism underlying the antioxidant effect of Sesns has remained unknown, however. The Nrf 2 -Keap 1 pathway provides cellular defense against oxidative stress by controlling {{the expression of}} antioxidant enzymes. We now show that Sesn 1 and Sesn 2 interact with the Nrf 2 suppressor Keap 1, the autophagy substrate p 62, and the ubiquitin ligase Rbx 1 and that the antioxidant function of Sesns is mediated through activation of Nrf 2 in a manner reliant on p 62 -dependent autophagic degradation of Keap 1. Sesn 2 was upregulated in the liver of mice subjected to fasting or subsequent <b>refeeding</b> with a high-carbohydrate, fat-free diet, whereas only <b>refeeding</b> promoted Keap 1 degradation and Nrf 2 activation, because only <b>refeeding</b> induced p 62 expression. Ablation of Sesn 2 blocked Keap 1 degradation and Nrf 2 activation induced by <b>refeeding</b> and thereby increased the susceptibility of the liver to oxidative damage resulting from the acute stimulation of lipogenesis associated with <b>refeeding...</b>|$|R
40|$|The safety {{analysis}} of medium-sized High-Temperature Reactors (HTR) {{has to make}} a statement an the technical basis for the risk during a hypothetical core heat-up accident. The failure of the core heat removal system determines the risk of the HTR. During this accident the liner cooling system is the only active heat sink. Thera are conceivable accidents during which the core cooling system and the liner cooling system are not avaiiable for a considerable time. This paper investigates experimentally and theoreticaily the possibility of refeeding the liner coofing system and the heat transfer processes of a two-phase flow during a refeeding of the liner cooling system above the saturation temperature. The experiments have shown that even at an initial temperature of 700 °C it is stillpossible to <b>refeed</b> the liner cooling system without difficufty. Depending an the initial temperature and flow, a steam blockage of the wofing tubes may temporarily occur but this does not interrupt the wofing process. At initial temperatures far above the saturation temperature it is advisable to carry out reflooding with a flow below that of normal operation in order to avoid excessive pressure in the hot tubes and to keep the thermal stress low. The SIKADE- 2 simulation gave good agreement with the experimental data. Theapplication of the reflooding process to the liner cooling system in the THTR- 300 during a core heat-up accident enables one to state that reflooding of the liner cooling system in the cylindrical wall would take about 10 or 20 minutes if refeeding is assumed to start at an initial temperature of 300 °C or 450 °C...|$|E
40|$|To {{increase}} process yields for {{virus vaccine}} production in mammalian cell culture {{an increase in}} cell density is of prior interest. However, often a so-called "cell density effect" [1] results in high cell densities without corresponding increase in product. Typically, a lack of medium components or an accumulation of inhibitory compounds seems {{to be responsible for}} this effect and strategies to overcome it consist of discontinuous or continuous medium exchanges. Here, we present results obtained from perfusion cultivations of an influenza vaccine production process with adherent Madin Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK). The process consists of a cell growth phase and a virus replication phase [2]. Cultivations were performed with microcarrier concentrations up to 12 g/L (Cytodex 1) in serum-containing and in serum-free medium. Cell numbers on microcarriers at time of infection of 8. 0 x 106 and 9. 5 x 106 cells/mL, respectively, were achieved. During cell growth the perfusion rate was increased proportional to cell numbers from initially 0. 04 h- 1 to 0. 2 h- 1. During virus replication perfusion rate was set to 0. 3 h- 1. For comparison results of repeated batch strategies are discussed. The specific virus productivities remained constant compared to a standard process with microcarrier concentration of 2 g/L and cell numbers at time of infection of about 1. 6 x 106 cells/mL. With the chosen perfusion strategy during cell growth and virus replication the "cell density effect" could thus be overcome. [1] Ferreira, T. B., Ferreira, A. L., Carrondo, M. J. T., Alves, P.

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: The {{period of}} refeeding in {{patients}} with acute pancreatitis is critical because they may have pain relapse. A multicentre, multidimensional, prospective study was performed to assess the frequency and the risk factors of pain relapse in these patients. METHODS: Patients were included if they had acute pancreatitis severe enough to stop oral feeding for more than 48 hours. Clinical, biochemical, radiological, and therapeutic data were prospectively recorded and analysed by unidimensional and multidimensional analysis. The moment to <b>refeed</b> patients was chosen by the clinician but the diet was the same in all centres. RESULTS: A total of 116 patients were included with a Ranson's bioclinical score > or = 3 in 35 % and a Balthazar's CT score > or = D in 42 %. The cause of acute pancreatitis was biliary in 47 % and alcohol misuse in 31 %. During the oral refeeding period, 21 % of the patients had pain relapse. This occurred on days 1 and 2 in 50 % of patients. The duration of the painful period was longer in patients who relapsed than in others (p 3 x the upper limit of the normal range the day before refeeding and in 16 % of other patients (p < 0. 03). Patients with higher Balthazar's CT scores had pain relapse more often than the others (p < 0. 002). None of the therapeutic procedures significantly modified the frequency of pain relapse. Using multidimensional analysis, Balathazar's CT score, period of pain, and serum lipase concentration the day before refeeding were independently {{associated with an increased}} risk of pain relapse. At a threshold of 0. 5, a logistic score had a 37 % sensitivity, 95 % specificity, and 83 % accuracy to predict pain relapse. Pain relapse nearly doubled total hospital stay and hospital stay after the first attempt at oral refeeding. CONCLUSION: Pain relapse occurred in one fifth of the patients with acute pancreatitis during oral refeeding and was more common {{in patients with}} necrotic pancreatitis and with longer periods of pain. The results of this study can be used to predict high risk patients and are a first step in the prevention of pain relapse...|$|E
40|$|SummaryInsulin {{receptor}} substrate (Irs) mediates metabolic {{actions of}} insulin. Here, {{we show that}} hepatic Irs 1 and Irs 2 function in a distinct manner in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. The PI 3 K activity associated with Irs 2 began to increase during fasting, reached its peak immediately after <b>refeeding,</b> and decreased rapidly thereafter. By contrast, the PI 3 K activity associated with Irs 1 began to increase a few hours after <b>refeeding</b> and reached its peak thereafter. The data indicate that Irs 2 mainly functions during fasting and immediately after <b>refeeding,</b> and Irs 1 functions primarily after <b>refeeding.</b> In fact, liver-specific Irs 1 -knockout mice failed to exhibit insulin resistance during fasting, but showed insulin resistance after refeeding; conversely, liver-specific Irs 2 -knockout mice displayed insulin resistance during fasting but not after <b>refeeding.</b> We propose {{the concept of the}} existence of a dynamic relay between Irs 1 and Irs 2 in hepatic insulin signaling during fasting and feeding...|$|R
40|$|<b>Refeeding</b> {{syndrome}} encompasses {{fluid and}} electrolyte imbalances and metabolic, intestinal, and cardio-respiratory derangements associated with appreciable morbidity and mortality. Although <b>refeeding</b> syndrome {{has been well}} documented in concentration-camp subjects, and more recently during parenteral therapy of critically ill patients, {{little is known about the}} importance of <b>refeeding</b> syndrome during recovery from a hunger strike. Thus, we studied the response to a four-step dietary replenishment routine in eight hunger strikers who refused food for 43 d. In this retrospective, observational study, we assessed the safety and efficacy of the <b>refeeding</b> procedure and analyzed the clinical and nutritional course of the cohort during both starvation and <b>refeeding,</b> mainly on the basis of clinical as well as a few biochemical determinations. During starvation, average weight loss was about 18 % and, with the exception of occasional oral vitamins and electrolytes, the subjects consumed only water. Available body-composition and biochemical profiles showed no clinically significant changes during starvation, but one-half of the group displayed spontaneous diarrhea at some time before <b>refeeding.</b> Stepwise nutritional replenishment lasted for 9 d, after which all patients tolerated a full, unrestricted diet. Only one episode of diarrhea occurred during this phase, and both clinical and biochemical indexes confirmed a favorable clinical course, without any manifestation of <b>refeeding</b> syndrome. In conclusion, we observed the following: 1) Hypophosphatemia and other micronutrient imbalances did not occur, nor was macronutrient intoler-ance detected. 2) Despite some episodes of diarrhea, nutritional replenishment was not associated with significant enteral dysfunction. 3) There was some fluid retention, but this was mild. 4) Acute-phase markers were abnormally elevated during the <b>refeeding</b> phase, without associated sepsis or inflammation...|$|R
