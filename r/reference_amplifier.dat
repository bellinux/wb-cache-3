40|$|Silicon carbide (SiC) {{integrated}} circuits (ICs) can enable {{the emergence of}} robust and reliable systems, including data acquisition and on-site control for extreme environments with high temperature and high radiation such as deep earth drilling, space and aviation, electric and hybrid vehicles, and combustion engines. In particular, SiC ICs provide significant benefit by reducing power dissipation and leakage current at temperatures above 300 °C compared to the Si counterpart. In fact, Si-based ICs have a limited maximum operating temperature which is around 300 °C for silicon on insulator (SOI). Owing to its superior material properties such as wide bandgap, three times larger than Silicon, and low intrinsic carrier concentration, SiC is an excellent candidate for high-temperature applications. In this thesis, analog and mixed-signal circuits have been implemented using SiC bipolar technology, including bandgap <b>references,</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> a master-slave comparator, an 8 -bit R- 2 R ladder-based digital-to-analog converter (DAC), a 4 -bit flash analog-to-digital converter (ADC), and a 10 -bit successive-approximation-register (SAR) ADC. Spice models were developed at binned temperature points from room temperature to 500 °C, to simulate and predict the circuits’ behavior with temperature variation. The high-temperature performance of the fabricated chips has been investigated and verified over a wide temperature range from 25 °C to 500 °C. A stable gain of 39 dB was measured in the temperature range from 25 °C up to 500 °C for the inverting operational amplifier with ideal closed-loop gain of 40 dB. Although the circuit design in an immature SiC bipolar technology is challenging due to the low current gain of the transistors and lack of complete AC models, various circuit techniques have been applied to mitigate these problems. This thesis details the challenges faced and methods employed for device modeling, integrated circuit design, layout implementation and finally performance verification using on-wafer characterization of the fabricated SiC ICs over a wide temperature range.

SNR of SiPMs is given by {{the ratio of the}} photogenerated current, filtered and averaged by a lock-in amplifier, and the Root Mean Square (RMS) deviation of the same current. In our measurements, we have employed a 10 Hz equivalent noise bandwidth, around the lock-in <b>amplifier</b> <b>reference</b> frequency. The measured noise takes into account the shot noise, resulting from the photocurrent and the dark current, while background light is not present in our setup.

Our measurements highlight a quasi-flat trend of the SiPM SNR up to an overvoltage of about 5 V (with respect to the breakdown voltage of 28. 0 V).

The main characteristics of the CCD were identified. Laboratory tests established the variation within the flat field, confirmed that the variation of dark current with change in ambient temperature could be predicted by a simple equation, and showed that the dark current could be reduced to approximately 0. 2 counts / second (giving a noise level of 12. 5 21 ectrons / V t seconds) at an ambient temperature of 4 ° C by the addition of cooling fins. Field commissioning established signal to noise levels of the system and identified the dominant source of noise arising from digitization of the on-chip <b>amplifier.</b> <b>Reference</b> charts were produced which quickly enables the expected signal to noise to be determined for an object at a given magnitude at various integration times. The limiting magnitude of the system was determined. Suitable red and blue optical filters were purchased, a filter holder fabricated, and the effective wavelength of the system calculated. One potential area of research identified was the photomeiry of active galactic nuclei. Results extrapolated from early B stars in Perseus, show that {{it should be possible to}} determine the spectral index of a 16 th R magnitude object to an accuracy of+ or - 1 unit. Further potential applications were identified and a user guide to the CCD camera was written...|$|R
