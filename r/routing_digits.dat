50|$|Bell Telex users had {{to select}} which IRC to use, and then append the {{necessary}} <b>routing</b> <b>digits.</b> The IRCs converted between TWX and Western Union Telegraph Co. standards.|$|E
50|$|The {{area code}} (the STD code) for the called party would be {{translated}} by a register/translator into the routing code {{that set the}} route through the GSC's for the calling party to the called parties' exchange. a maximum of 6 <b>routing</b> <b>digits</b> was possible hence giving restrictions {{on the number of}} exchanges that could be directly dialled.|$|E
5000|$|The {{holding time}} of the A-digit {{selector}} and director {{will depend on the}} number (1 to 6) and length of code digits to be sent, and whether numeric digits are also to be sent, but averages 20 seconds. On a call to the operator via digit “0” which has already been received by the A-digit selector and requires no more than four <b>routing</b> <b>digits</b> [...] and no numeric digits, the holding time will be only 2 or 3 seconds. As traffic to the operator via digit “0” is small, this level on the A-digit selector does not have its own group of directors; {{one or more of the}} other groups of directors is equipped with the necessary manual board facilities. Seizure of one of these directors via level [...] "0" [...] passes a discrimination signal to it which causes it to pulse out the <b>routing</b> <b>digits</b> to give access to the operator with no further dialling required by the subscriber.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{the far end}} {{sends the}} {{supervision}} flash, the user would use the blue box to dial a [...] "Key Pulse" [...] or [...] "KP", the tone that starts a <b>routing</b> <b>digit</b> sequence, followed by either a telephone number {{or one of the}} numerous special codes that were used internally by the telephone company, then finished up with a [...] "Start" [...] or [...] "ST" [...] tone. At this point, {{the far end of the}} connection would route the call the way you told it, while the user's local exchange would presume the call was still ringing at the original number. KP1 is generally used for domestic dialing where KP2 would be for international calls.|$|R
50|$|The {{second part}} of the {{numerator}} (after the dash) is the bank's ABA Institution Identifier, which also forms digits 5 to 8 of the nine <b>digit</b> <b>routing</b> number (YYYY).|$|R
5000|$|As {{this and}} other {{improved}} technologies became available, as well as Automatic Message Accounting (AMA) computers to process the long distance records into customer bills, the reach of DDD was slow in the 1950s, but quickened in the early 1960s. Electronic switching systems with stored-program capability allowed electronic processing of the dialed digits, referring to electronic memories to determine call routing, and this has reached {{the state of the}} art, with digital telephone exchanges which are basically specialized computers that route voice traffic from one [...] "peripheral" [...] to another as digital data. Call routing can now be done based on the area code, central office code and even the first two digits of the line number, although <b>routing</b> based on <b>digits</b> past the central office code is usually limited to cases of competitive local exchange carriers, number pooling and number portability.|$|R
50|$|When {{sufficient}} digits {{had been}} received, the MCU {{would have been}} able to determine the required path through the exchange, the <b>routing</b> <b>digits</b> to be sent (if an outgoing call is indicated), and which of the received digits have to be repeated forward. It would advise the register accordingly and then set the paths necessary to allow the register to signal forward and finally extend the caller to the required number or junction.|$|E
50|$|MF {{and other}} in-band {{signaling}} systems differ from Signaling System 7 (SS7) {{in that the}} <b>routing</b> <b>digits</b> are out-pulsed in MF format in the same voiceband channel used for voice. The dialing user cannot detect these digits being out-pulsed because the audio connection is not established {{all the way to}} the user’s handset or device until after the connection is established with the terminating switch. Following a full connection, the same audio channel is connected to the user in order to communicate the voice, modem or fax data across that same 64-kbit channel previously used for the in-band MF signaling.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the call}} starts to ring, the caller uses the blue box {{to send a}} 2600 Hz tone (or 2600+2400 Hz on many {{international}} trunks followed by a 2400 Hz tone). The 2600 Hz is a supervisory signal, because it indicates {{the status of a}} trunk; on hook (tone) or off-hook (no tone). By playing this tone, you are convincing {{the far end of the}} connection that you've hung up and it should wait. When the tone stops, the trunk will go off-hook and on-hook (known as a supervision flash), making a [...] "Ka-Cheep" [...] noise, followed by silence. This is the far end of the connection signalling to the near end that it is now waiting for <b>routing</b> <b>digits.</b>|$|E
5000|$|From the Welcome Page it was {{possible}} for any user to find pages of information in several different ways, or a combination of them. Printed directories were available which gave the full page numbers corresponding to the items in an alphabetical index. Pages were accessed directly by keying [...] "*page number#". Individual pages often had links to related pages which could be accessed by use of one or two <b>digit</b> <b>routing</b> codes. This feature was widely used on sets of index pages which were commonly grouped by subject heading, provided both by the Post Office/BT and by individual IPs. Because of the numerical limitation, it was often necessary to go through a series of index pages in order to reach the desired page. Extension frames which might be required to view further information on a topic could be only accessed by use of the [...] "#" [...] key. From 1987 onwards, it became possible to use access Prestel pages via use of special alphabetic codes, provided that the IP who owned the page set up a special keyword mapped onto that page. Thus, by keying *M NEWS#, it {{was possible}} for a user to route directly to page *40111# to obtain news about micro-computers.|$|R
5000|$|When STD codes were {{initially}} assigned, Romford {{was given the}} mnemonic code RO8 (corresponding to 708 on the rotary dial), with Hornchurch {{and the rest of}} the area using the HX2 (402) code. With the transition to all-figure dialling which ended the practice of representing STD codes with letters in 1966, and including the trunk prefix, these became 0708 and 0402. The 0402 code covered seven exchanges in a linked numbering scheme, with an additional digit for each exchange, as below. Internally, the 0402 code was translated to <b>routing</b> <b>digits</b> by registers to the same string of digits as 0708 plus an additional 8, which corresponded to the 8 in the local code from Romford Group Switching Centre to the local exchange. This technique was used to keep the dialled string down to the 10 digit limit that was imposed (though Stapleford only had 3 digit local numbers and South Ockendon 4 digits and so these could be dialled as 0708 8x xxx as well as the official 0402x xxx / xxxx.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The Registers were [...] "owned" [...] by the MCUs {{and each}} MCU had {{a maximum of}} 36 Registers. The MCU was {{responsible}} for looking after all of its Registers and deciding from the dialled information where the call {{was going to be}} routed. The local exchange numbering system would be available to the MCU via threadings in the cyclic store so the MCU would be able to read this information and in this way all exchanges could be configured as required. If a call was identified by the MCU as being own exchange, usually by the first digit, then the MCU would tell the Register to come back when the complete number had been dialled. If the first dialled digit was a zero then this would normally be routed straight to the Group Switching Centre. However, if the exchange had an Alternative Available Route say 0296 then the MCU would have to wait until enough <b>routing</b> <b>digits</b> had been received to make a routing decision. Again this AAR information was stored in the cyclic stores. Once the MCU had decided the routing, it sent a command to the Interrogator/Markers to set up the required path and also told the Register what dialled digits to forward on. Then the MCU would {{move on to the next}} task. Once the connection had been established, the Supervisory Processing Unit (SPU) took care of the path and all the call metering tasks. The MCUs had core memory to hold the dialled digits from all the Registers and also had other storage to manipulate call set-up information. There were three scan rates: 156ms for subscribers, 36ms for Registers, Outgoing Junctions and Routing Translations, and 12ms for Incoming Junctions. The last of these was obviously the quickest scan, to ensure that no incoming digits were lost from the incoming junctions. (A junction in BT terminology was not a junction in the ordinary sense of the word, but was the name given to a pair of wires connecting a call between a 'satellite' telephone exchange and the main exchange.) ...|$|E
