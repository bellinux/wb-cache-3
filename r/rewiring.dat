5|$|A £3million {{refurbishment}} of {{the crypt}} {{was completed in}} 2009 and was officially re-opened on 1 May that year by the Duke of Gloucester. The refurbishment included new east and west approaches, archive provision, <b>rewiring</b> and new lighting, catering facilities, a new chancel, new toilets and revamped exhibitions.|$|E
5|$|The £3million {{refurbishment}} by Fry, {{the most}} extensive programme of work since the theatre had been saved from virtual collapse almost 30 years before, included an expanded foyer, improved lift and disabled access to the stalls and royal circle levels, complete refurbishment of the bars {{and the creation of}} The Jeremy Fry Bar, in the former cellars of The Garrick's Head pub, and redecoration of the auditorium. Technical improvements included the rebuilding of the Main House stage, and an extensive <b>rewiring</b> and lighting programme around the entire building, with new fire alarm systems, air-conditioning and lighting, all designed to improve the building's efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint by some 30%. The design was by architects of the Fielden Clegg Bradley Studios, and the construction firm Midas was contracted to complete the building work.|$|E
5|$|Around 1670, {{the church}} was refurbished, a gallery was built at {{the western end of}} the nave, and the carved reredos and a large wooden Royal coat of arms, now at the west end of the nave, were {{acquired}} at the same time. An inspection report {{at the end of the}} 18th century commented on the dirty transept walls, and the need to install the equivalent of a cattle grid to keep pigs out of the churchyard. Rich crimson hangings in the church had earlier attracted the attention of a thief. The increasing congregation led to the replacement of the pews and the construction of galleries down both sides of the building in 1829, but a more extensive rebuilding was undertaken in 1878–80, by James Piers St Aubyn. The galleries were removed and the two outer aisles were added during this period, a chapel was converted to a vestry and improvements were made to the Hastings Chapel. The cost of these works has been estimated as between £16,000 and more than £18,000. Later developments included the expenditure of £13,000 between 1963 and 1968 to combat deathwatch beetles found during <b>rewiring,</b> improvements to the heating system, and a rededication in 1974, the quincentenary of the church.|$|E
40|$|Dissertation[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] <b>ReWire</b> {{provides}} engineers with {{a tool to}} specify, verify {{and implement}} hardware devices for FPGAs from a high-level Haskell-like language. Previous work has shown <b>ReWire</b> to be a productive source language for developing whole systems {{in the form of}} single, monolithic monadic specifications. To achieve scale, modularity and reusability, some form of modularity principle must be identified and realized within <b>ReWire.</b> What are the basic units of a <b>ReWire</b> specification and how may such units be identified, abstracted over and reused to achieve a realistic work flow for device construction in <b>ReWire?</b> This research identifies a modularity principle for <b>ReWire</b> as a suite of language abstractions for breaking apart <b>ReWire</b> specifications into its constituent components called Connect Logic and considers its implementation and application. Extending <b>ReWire</b> with support for device-level composition would significantly enhance its usefulness. This work integrates a suite of functions into <b>ReWire</b> which provide engineers the ability to incorporate existing specifications into new designs and the ability perform traditional decomposition of large specifications. Connect Logic provides an intuitive way to consider synchronous versus combinational logic in hardware designs. We demonstrate applications of Connect Logic to improve the performance of systems including cryptographic ciphers. We utilize Connect Logic to develop a fully pipelined microprocessor, to implement commonly used high-level concurrency primitives in hardware, and we demonstrate Connect Logic as a substrate for visual programming...|$|R

50|$|After the Justice League's return, Tim {{focuses on}} {{stopping}} a recurring foe {{during his time}} as Batman, Davis Dusk aka <b>Rewire.</b> <b>Rewire</b> is revealed to be an alive Terry McGinnis, who was brainwashed by the villain Spellbinder (who projects himself to Terry as an old woman named Doris Shelby) into working for the Evil Factory, thinking he was Davis Dusk, and that Batman wanted him dead. Terry used the <b>Rewire</b> suit to instigate four nights of power outages, causing riots which kept the police and Batman distracted from Spellbinder's activities. After <b>Rewire</b> fights Barbara and she discovers his true identity, Terry knocks her out and brings her to Blackgate, where Spellbinder brainwashes her too. Tim shows up to Blackgate and faces off against the brainwashed Barbara and <b>Rewire.</b> After Tim knocks off <b>Rewire's</b> helmet and discovers that Terry's alive (which he discovers was caused by altering the timeline in the past), Matt takes the Batmobile to Blackgate and distracts Terry from Tim by trying to free him from Spellbinder's illusion. Tim ultimately defeats Spellbinder and Terry's memories are restored. The four of them return to the Batcave, where Tim gives the mantle of Batman back to Terry and leaves {{to learn more about}} this foreign world.

25|$|The inquiry was {{chaired by}} QC Anthony Hidden and {{published}} {{a report in}} September 1989. It found that the direct cause of the disaster was sloppy work practices in which an old wire, incorrectly left in place after <b>rewiring</b> work and still connected at the supply end, created a false feed to a signal relay, thereby causing its signal to show green when it should have shown red. A contributing technical factor {{was the lack of}} double switching in the signal relay circuits, which would have prevented a single false feed causing an accident.|$|E

Though {{the idea of a}} stored-program computer with combined memory for program and data was conceived during the development of ENIAC, it was not initially implemented in ENIAC because World War II priorities required the machine to be completed quickly, and ENIAC's 20 storage locations would be too small to hold data and programs.|$|E
25|$|In {{lab animals}} of all ages, {{environmental}} enrichment has {{been related to}} dendritic branching, spine density, and overall number of synapses. In addition, skill training {{has been shown to}} lead to the formation and stabilization of new spines while destabilizing old spines, suggesting that the learning of a new skill involves a <b>rewiring</b> process of neural circuits. Since the extent of spine remodeling correlates with success of learning, this suggests a crucial role of synaptic structural plasticity in memory formation. In addition, changes in spine stability and strengthening occur rapidly and have been observed within hours after training.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, some {{researchers}} hypothesize that the enrichment of network motifs is non-adaptive. In other words, gene regulatory networks can evolve {{to a similar}} structure without the specific selection on the proposed input-output behavior. Support for this hypothesis often comes from computational simulations. For example, fluctuations in the abundance of feed-forward loops in a model that simulates the evolution of gene regulatory networks by randomly <b>rewiring</b> nodes may suggest that the enrichment of feed-forward loops is a side-effect of evolution. In another model of gene regulator networks evolution, {{the ratio of the}} frequencies of gene duplication and gene deletion show great influence on network topology: certain ratios lead to the enrichment of feed-forward loops and create networks that show features of hierarchical scale free networks.|$|E
25|$|On the Greater Western franchise, {{the current}} fleet of HSTs is {{expected}} to remain in service until 2017, the scheduled date for introduction of the Intercity Express. Between 12 and 20 HST sets were to be retained and refurbished to carry on providing services between London and Devon and Cornwall, where no electrification is currently planned, and where the Class 800's engines would not be capable of negotiating the steep gradients along the South Devon Banks, through to the mid-2020s. A 2011 report concluded that the Mark 3 coaches could remain in service as late as 2035 with some minor <b>rewiring</b> and enhancements required under disability legislation. However, it was announced in March 2015 that, subject to approval and contract, the HSTs will now be replaced with the Class 802, a more powerful derivative of the bi-mode Class 800s.|$|E
25|$|Each {{component}} (or node) of a {{signaling pathway}} is classified according to the role it plays {{with respect to the}} initial stimulus. Ligands are termed first messengers, while receptors are the signal transducers, which then activate primary effectors. Such effectors are often linked to second messengers, which can activate secondary effectors, and so on. Depending on the efficiency of the nodes, a signal can be amplified (a concept known as signal gain), so that one signaling molecule can generate a response involving hundreds to millions of molecules. As with other signals, the transduction of biological signals is characterised by delay, noise, signal feedback and feedforward and interference, which can range from negligible to pathological. With the advent of computational biology, the analysis of signaling pathways and networks has become an essential tool to understand cellular functions and disease, including signaling <b>rewiring</b> mechanisms underlying responses to acquired drug resistance.|$|E
