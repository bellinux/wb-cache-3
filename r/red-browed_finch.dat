500|$|The {{southern}} boobook generally preys on insects, particularly nocturnal beetles and moths, mice, {{and birds}} {{the size of}} a house sparrow (Passer domesticus). A higher proportion of its diet is invertebrates compared with other Australian owls. Fieldwork in the vicinity of Canberra found that vertebrates made up more of the diet in autumn and particularly winter. Although more invertebrates were eaten than vertebrates (even more so in autumn), they made up only 2.8% of the biomass consumed. Prey species were mainly mammals, predominantly the house mouse (Mus musculus), and also black rat (Rattus rattus), bush rat (R. fuscipes), and Gould's wattled bat (Chalinolobus gouldii), birds including common starling (Sturnus vulgaris), house sparrow, <b>red-browed</b> <b>finch</b> [...] (Neochmia temporalis), common myna (Acridotheres tristis), red-rumped parrot (Psephotus haematonotus), and white-browed babbler (Pomatostomus superciliosus), and invertebrates including grasshoppers, crickets, [...] beetles, cockroaches, moths, wolf spiders and huntsman spiders. A study in Victoria found that larger animals were eaten, including Baillon's crake (Porzana pusilla), common ringtail possum [...] (Pseudocheirus peregrinus) and feral rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus).|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-browed</b> <b>finch</b> and plum-headed finch are {{sometimes}} placed in other genera.|$|E
50|$|Red-browed finches {{are common}} aviary birds. The <b>red-browed</b> <b>finch</b> will {{sometimes}} hybridise with the star finch, crimson finch, and zebra finch if kept together in captivity.|$|E
50|$|Peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) and wedge-tailed eagles {{patrol the}} cliffs {{further into the}} Gorge whilst, below, {{numerous}} parrots and honeyeaters forage amongst the eucalypt canopy. Closer to ground level, visitors are likely to encounter the Australian raven (Corvus coronoides) and the pied currawong (Strepera graculina) anywhere they stop to eat. Along the walking tracks many smaller species will {{be present in the}} ground cover and understory including <b>red-browed</b> <b>finches</b> (Neochmia temporalis), white-browed scrubwrens (Sericornis frontalis), and several species of thornbill.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mountains}} {{are part of}} the Bunya Mountains and Yarraman Important Bird Area which contains what is thought to be the largest population of the black-breasted button-quail. In the park, 120 species of bird have been recorded. Significant species include the wedge-tailed eagle, peregrine falcon, grey goshawk, brown cuckoo-dove, rose robin, eastern yellow robin, large-billed gerygone, and Australian golden whistler. [...] The Bunya Mountains support the most westerly populations of many rainforest dwelling species, including green catbirds, regent bowerbirds, paradise riflebirds, eastern whipbirds, noisy pittas and the Australian logrunner. Some of the more commonly seen species include pied currawongs, laughing kookaburras, king parrots, crimson rosellas, sulphur-crested cockatoos, <b>red-browed</b> <b>finches,</b> white-browed scrubwrens, satin bowerbirds, wonga pigeons and brush turkeys.|$|R
50|$|Fauna on the {{mountain}} includes swamp wallabies, deer, spotted-tailed quolls, southern brown bandicoots, grey-headed flying foxes, sugar gliders, wombats, possums, giant burrowing frogs, red-crowned toadlets, striped marsh frogs, eastern water dragons, water skinks, blue-tongued lizards, diamond pythons, red-bellied black snakes, golden-crowned snakes and broad-headed snakes, {{although it is not}} common to see snakes, as some sources state incorrectly. Common birds are lyrebirds, spotted turtle doves, kookaburras, satin bower birds, superb blue wrens, crimson rosellas, king parrots, white-headed pigeons, brown cuckoo-doves, silvereyes, eastern yellow robins, rainbow lorikeets, little wattlebirds, grey and pied butcherbirds, yellow-tailed black cockatoos, golden whistlers, topknot ("flocker") pigeons, wonga pigeons, Australian magpies, pied currawongs, Australian ravens, noisy miners, honeyeaters (Lewin's, New Holland, spinebill, yellow-faced) eastern whipbirds, white-browed scrub wrens, rufous fantails, <b>red-browed</b> <b>finches,</b> and welcome swallows. In 1804 a logrunner bird was collected on Mount Kembla, this being the first to be scientifically described, although it is not common to see logrunners, or brush turkeys as some sources incorrectly state.|$|R
50|$|The term firetail {{is given}} to the four species of Australian finches {{belonging}} to the genus Stagonopleura. The <b>red-browed</b> <b>finch</b> has also been called red-browed firetail.|$|E
50|$|Glossy black {{cockatoos}} {{break the}} cones {{to eat the}} seeds, which mature in winter. The seed is eaten by the <b>red-browed</b> <b>finch,</b> and peaceful dove (Geopelia placida).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Red-browed</b> <b>finch</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by the English ornithologist John Latham in 1801 under the binomial name Fringilla temporalis.It {{is one of four}} species in the genus Neochmia. Alternate names include red-browed firetail.|$|E
40|$|Urbanisation has the {{potential}} to increase the risk of parasitism on wildlife. Although some ectoparasite groups appear unaffected, different responses are hypothesised for parasites with simpler life histories such as gastrointestinal parasites. <b>Red-browed</b> <b>finches</b> (RBF) and the superb fairywrens (SFW), two native passerine birds affected by urbanisation, were examined for Coccidian parasites along an urbanisation gradient in New South Wales, Australia, in order to detect if prevalence might be directly related to the degree of urbanisation. Influence of urbanisation on Coccidian infection was differential. In RBF, the prevalence of Isospora increased significantly in more urbanised areas but prevalence did not change between breeding and non-breeding seasons. In contrast, in SFW, the degree of urbanisation did not significantly change with the degree of urbanisation, and season exhibited no significant effects on the prevalence of coccidians. Diet, behaviour and habits are suspected to be the most influential factors on the variation seen between both species where granivorous and gregarious species are significantly infected. Since the dynamics of urban wildlife-pathogen interactions is largely unexplored, more studies are needed to corroborate if this pattern of Isospora infections can be extended to other passerine birds in cities from Australia and overseas...|$|R
50|$|Most are {{sensitive}} to cold and require warm, usually tropical, habitats, although a few, such as the eastern alpine mannikin, mountain firetail and <b>red-browed</b> <b>finch,</b> and the genus Stagonopleura, have adapted to the cooler climates of southern Australia and the highlands of New Guinea.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-browed</b> <b>finch</b> {{is highly}} sociable, {{and is usually}} seen in small flocks of 10 to 20 individuals. Flocks are {{sedentary}} or nomadic in their local area. Flocks prefer semi-open woodland, especially edges of forests, where brushy scrub meets cleared areas, especially near creeks.|$|E
50|$|The spectacled finch (Callacanthis burtoni, {{also known}} as <b>red-browed</b> <b>finch)</b> is a species of finch in the family Fringillidae. It is found in {{temperate}} northern regions of the Indian subcontinent, ranging across Afghanistan, India, Nepal, and Pakistan. Its natural habitat is temperate forests with a lush landscape.|$|E
50|$|The Cascade Falls Walk is a one {{kilometre}} track, easy grade. It goes beside Cascade Creek at {{the base}} of Macquarie Pass to a small waterfall. Birds found here include green catbird, rose robin, <b>red-browed</b> <b>finch,</b> yellow-throated scrubwren, brown gerygone, Lewin's honeyeater, crimson rosella. Fungi are apparent here.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-browed</b> <b>finch</b> (Neochmia temporalis) is an estrildid finch that inhabits {{the east}} coast of Australia. This species has also been {{introduced}} to French Polynesia. It is commonly found in temperate forest and dry savannah habitats. It may also be found in dry forest and mangrove habitats in tropical region.|$|E
50|$|The park {{is home to}} {{many native}} animals such as possums, and a rich variety of birdlife which includes: Pacific black duck, {{chestnut}} teal, white-faced heron, brown goshawk, collared sparrowhawk, Horsfield's bronze cuckoo, Australian hobby, galah, red-rumped parrot, eastern rosella, superb fairy-wren, white-plumed honeyeater, spotted pardalote, white-browed scrubwren, grey fantail and <b>red-browed</b> <b>finch.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-browed</b> <b>finch,</b> {{like other}} weaver finches, builds a large domed nest, {{with a side}} entrance, out of grass and small twigs. Nests are usually built 2-3 metres above the ground in dense shrubs. Nesting is communal. Both parents share nest building, {{incubation}} of the eggs, and feed the young together. Four to six white eggs are laid per clutch {{two or three times}} per year, between October and April. Juveniles are fully independent within 28 days.|$|E
40|$|A new Isospora (Apicomplexa: Eimeriidae) {{species is}} {{described}} {{from a single}} <b>red-browed</b> <b>finch</b> (Neochmia temporalis) (subspecies N. temporalis temporalis), {{that was part of}} a captive population in Western Australia. Sporulated oocysts of this isolate are spherical, 18. 3 (18. 2 - 18. 9) × 18. 2 (18. 2 - 18. 6) μm, with a shape index (length/width) of 1. 0; and a smooth and bilayered oocyst wall, 1. 2 μm thick (outer layer 0. 9 μm, inner 0. 3 μm). A polar granule is present, but the oocyst residuum and a micropyle are absent. The sporocysts are ovoid-shaped, 13. 3 (9. 5 - 16. 4) × 8. 6 (6. 8 - 10. 0) μm, with a shape index of 1. 5. An indistinct Stieda body is present, but the substieda body is absent. A sporocyst residuum is present and composed of numerous granules of different size scattered among the sporozoites. Morphologically, the oocysts from this isolate are different from those of all known valid Isospora spp. Molecular analysis was conducted at 4 loci; the 18 S and 28 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase (COI) gene and the heat shock protein 70 (hsp 70) gene. At the 18 S locus, this new isolate exhibited 99. 9 %, 99. 8 %, 99. 7 %, and 99. 5 % similarity to I. sp. MAH- 2013 a from a superb starling (Lamprotornis superbus), I. MS- 2003 from a Southern cape sparrow (Passer melanurus), I. sp. Tokyo from a domestic pigeon (Columba livia domestica) and I. MS- 2003 from a Surinam crested oropendula (Psarocolius decumanus). At the 28 S locus, this new isolate exhibited 99. 7 % similarity to both an Isospora sp (MS- 2003) from a Northern house sparrow (Passer domesticus) and an Isospora sp. (MS- 2003) from a Southern cape sparrow. At the COI locus, this new isolate exhibited 98. 9 % similarity to an Isospora sp. ex Apodemus flavicollis. At the hsp 70 locus, this new isolate exhibited 99 % similarity to isolate MS- 2003 (. AY 283879) from a wattled starling (Creatophora cinerea). Based on morphological and molecular data, this isolate is a new species of Isospora, which is named Isospora neochmiae n. sp. after its host, the <b>red-browed</b> <b>finch</b> (Neochmia temporalis) ...|$|E
