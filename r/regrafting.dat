We planned a study to analyze the indications and outcome of repeat penetrating keratoplasty in a tertiary care centre in India. Methods A retrospective analysis of all the patients who underwent repeat penetrating keratoplasty, between January 1999 and December 2001 was performed. The parameters evaluated were indication for the primary penetrating keratoplasty, causes of failure of the previous graft, and final visual outcome and clarity of the repeat corneal grafts. Results Of fifty-three eyes of 50 patients with repeat penetrating keratoplasty (three patients underwent bilateral corneal <b>regrafts),</b> 37 eyes had undergone one <b>regraft</b> each, 14 eyes two <b>regrafts</b> and two eyes had three <b>regrafts.</b> The follow-up of the patients ranged from one to three years. The most common primary etiologic diagnosis was vascularized corneal scars (66 %), of which the scars related to infection were most common (68. 5 %). Twenty-eight <b>regrafts</b> (52. 8 %) remained clear at a mean follow-up of 1. 54 ± 0. 68 years, of which 25 were single <b>regrafts</b> (89. 3 %). The commonest cause of failure of <b>regraft</b> was infection to the corneal graft (recurrence of herpetic infection in 9 eyes and perforated graft ulcers in 3 eyes). Three (18. 6 %) of the 16 eyes with multiple corneal <b>regrafts</b> achieved a BCVA of 6 / 60. Overall, only five eyes (all with single <b>regraft)</b> achieved a BCVA of 6 / 18 or better {{at the end of}} follow-up. Conclusion Graft infection {{is the leading cause of}} failure of repeat keratoplasty in this part of the world.

40|$|It {{has become}} {{well known that}} an {{evolutionary}} tree is inadequate to represent fully the history of life. Two possible {{ways of dealing with}} this are the rooted subtree prune and <b>regraft</b> distance between a pair of trees, which measures how different they are, and the slightly more biologically sound hybridisation number of a set of trees that attempts to determine the minimum number of hybrid events that must have occurred for a given set of evolutionary trees.

This thesis investigates ways of improving existing algorithms for calculating the minimum rooted subtree prune and <b>regraft</b> distance and hybridisation number for a pair or, in the latter case, set of trees. In both cases a technique is used that allows the problem to be rekernelised during the run of the program.

An alternative, more wide-ranging search, subtree pruning and <b>regrafting</b> (SPR), selects and removes a subtree from the main tree and reinserts it elsewhere on the main tree {{to create a new}} node. Finally, tree bisection and reconnection (TBR) detaches a subtree from the main tree at an interior node and then attempts all possible connections between edges of the two trees thus created. The increasing complexity of the tree rearrangement technique correlates with increasing computational time required for the search, although not necessarily with their performance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Recently, Hill et al. 1 {{implemented}} a new software package [...] called SPRIT [...] which aims at calculating the {{minimum number of}} horizontal gene transfer events {{that is needed to}} simultaneously explain the evolution of two rooted binary phylogenetic trees on the same set of taxa. To this end, SPRIT computes the closely related so-called rooted subtree prune and <b>regraft</b> distance between two phylogenies. However, calculating this distance is an NP-hard problem and exact algorithms are often only applicable to small- or medium-sized problem instances. Trying to overcome this problem, Hill et al. propose a divide-and-conquer approach to speed up their algorithm and conjecture that this approach can be used to compute the rooted subtree prune and <b>regraft</b> distance exactly. Results In this note, we present a counterexample to Hill et al's conjecture and subsequently show that a modified version of their conjecture holds. Conclusion While Hill et al's conjecture may result in an overestimate of the rooted subtree prune and <b>regraft</b> distance, a slightly more restricted version of their approach gives the desired outcome and can be applied to speed up the exact calculation of this distance between two phylogenies. </p...|$|R
40|$|Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) is {{a common}} {{complication}} of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and may lead to corneal epithelial defect and melting. In contrast, recurrent corneal calcareous degeneration and perforation is rare. A 46 -year-old woman developed chronic GVHD after bone marrow transplantation for aplastic anemia. Severe KCS with corneal melting and calcium deposits were noted in the left eye. Penetrating keratoplasty was performed because of corneal perforation, but poor re-epithelialization and calcium deposition recurred. Lamellar keratectomy and amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) were performed, but acute calcareous degeneration developed with subsequent recurrence of corneal perforation. After <b>regraft,</b> AMT and tarsorrhaphy, the corneal graft remained clear for 3 months. However, breakdown of the corneal epithelium occurred 3 weeks after spontaneous separation of tarsorrhaphy. Six months later, corneal perforation recurred again along with exacerbation of GVHD. <b>Regraft</b> was performed, but the patient refused tarsorrhaphy and AMT. Poor re-epithelialization persisted after <b>regraft.</b> Corneal melting with impending corneal perforation ensued. Further corneal surgery was refused and the patient chose to undergo evisceration.

MethodsA total of 196 patients who underwent liver retransplantation using 225 grafts, between January 1982 and July 2007, were included in the study. The following parameters were analysed: patient demographics; primary diagnosis; distribution of retransplantation over different time periods; indications for retransplantation; time interval to retransplantation, and overall patient and graft survival. ResultsOf the 2437 primary orthotopic liver transplantations, 196 patients (8 %) required a first <b>regraft,</b> 23 patients (1 %) a second <b>regraft</b> and six patients (0. 25 %) a third <b>regraft.</b> Autoimmune hepatitis was the most common primary diagnosis for which retransplantation was required (12. 7 % of primary transplantations). The retransplantation rate declined from 12 % at the beginning of our programme to 7. 6 % at the end of the study period. The most common indication for retransplantation was hepatic artery thrombosis (31. 6 %). Nearly two-thirds of the retransplantations were performed within 6 months of the primary transplantation. The 1 -, 3 -, 5 - and 10 -year patient survival rates following first retransplantation were 66 %, 61 %, 57 % and 47 %, respectively. Five-year survival after second retransplantation was 40 %.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Comparison of cultured skin {{substitutes}} (CSSs) and split-thickness autograft (STAG) {{was performed}} to assess whether the requirement for autologous skin grafts may be reduced {{in the treatment of}} massive burns. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Cultured skin substitutes consisting of collagen-glycosaminoglycan substrates populated with autologous fibroblasts and keratinocytes have been demonstrated to close full-thickness skin wounds in athymic mice and to express normal skin antigens after closure of excised wounds in burn patients. METHODS: Data were collected from 17 patients between days 2 and 14 to determine incidence of exudate, incidence of <b>regrafting,</b> coloration, keratinization, and percentage of site covered by graft (n = 17). Outcome was evaluated on an ordinal scale (0 = worst; 10 = best) beginning at day 14, with primary analyses at 28 days (n = 10) and 1 year (n = 4) for erythema, pigmentation, epithelial blistering, surface roughness, skin suppleness, and raised scar. RESULTS: Sites treated with CSSs had increased incidence of exudate (p = 0. 06) and decreased percentage of engraftment (p < 0. 05) compared with STAG. Outcome parameters during the first year showed no differences in erythema, blistering, or suppleness. Pigmentation was greater, scar was less raised, but <b>regrafting</b> was more frequent in CSS sites than STAG. No differences in qualitative outcomes were found after 1 year, and antibodies to bovine collagen were not detected in patient sera. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that outcome of engrafted CSSs is not different from STAG and that increased incidence of <b>regrafting</b> is related to decreased percentage of initial engraftment. Increased rates of engraftment of CSSs may lead to improved outcome for closure of burn wounds, allow greater availability of materials for grafting, and reduce requirements for donor skin autograft...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} corneal graft survival over a 5 -year {{period and}} {{to investigate whether}} factors related to the donor, eye bank practices, the recipient, surgery, and postoperative course influenced the outcome. 	 Methods: Nine hundred ninety-eight patients were randomly selected and monitored in the subsequent 3 years from a cohort of 4500 recipients who underwent penetrating keratoplasty between 2001 and 2004. Cox univariate regression {{analysis was used to}} select variables to be included in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model with a backward selection procedure to identify potential risk factors for graft failure. Graft survival curves were obtained from Kaplan–Meier estimates. 	 Results: Ectasia/thinning was the most common indication (49. 1 %), followed by <b>regraft</b> (16. 1 %) and pseudophakic corneal edema (PCE) (9. 4 %). The overall rate of graft failure was 10. 7 % with 6 cases of primary graft failure. Adverse reactions and complications (other than graft failure) were reported in 2. 7 % of patients in the first postoperative week and in 22. 8 % during the full follow-up period. The probability of 5 -year survival was 83. 0 %, best in eyes with ectasia/thinning (96. 0 %) and less favorable in PCE (67. 0 %) and <b>regraft</b> (64. 0 %). Multivariate analyses showed the following variables to be linked to an increased risk of graft failure: <b>regraft</b> for any reason, all clinical indication except PCE, history of ocular inflammation/infection, pseudophakic/aphakic eye, vitrectomy, graft Descemet folds, adverse reactions/complications, and surgeons' low caseload.
