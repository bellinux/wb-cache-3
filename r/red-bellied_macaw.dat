25|$|The morphology-based {{taxonomy}} of C. spixii, intermediate between the macaws {{and the smaller}} Arini, has been confirmed by recent molecular phylogenetic studies. In a 2008 molecular phylogenetic study of 69 parrot genera, the clade diagrams indicate that C. spixii split from the ancestral parakeets before the differentiation of the modern macaws. However, {{not all of the}} macaw genera were represented in the study. The study also states that diversification of the Neotropical parrot lineages occurred starting 33 mya, a period roughly coinciding with the separation of South America from West Antarctica. The author notes that the study challenges the classification of British ornithologist Nigel Collar in the encyclopedic Handbook of the Birds of the World, volume 4 (1997). A 2011 study by the same authors which includes key genera of macaws further elucidates the macaw taxonomy: the clade diagram of that study places C. spixii in a clade including the macaw genera which is sister to a clade containing the Aratingas and other smaller parakeets. Within the macaw clade, C. spixii was the first taxon to diverge from the ancestral macaws; its nearest relatives are the <b>red-bellied</b> <b>macaw</b> (Orthopsittaca manilata) and the blue-headed macaw (Primolius couloni).|$|E
2500|$|Much remains {{uncertain}} {{about the extent}} of the bird's original range, because most of its woodland habitat was cleared before naturalists observed either the birds or the Caraiba nesting sites. The historical range is now believed to have encompassed portions of the states of Bahia and Pernambuco in a [...] wide corridor along a [...] stretch of the Rio São Francisco between Juazeiro (or possibly Remanso) and Abaré. Previous observations of the birds from further west are very difficult to explain but conceivably stem from either escaped captive birds or more likely the misidentification of another species such as <b>red-bellied</b> <b>macaw</b> (Orthopsittaca manilatus).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>red-bellied</b> <b>macaw</b> and {{blue-headed}} macaw are typically only found in captivity in a zoo setting, or {{as part of}} a breeding program and are rarely kept as pets.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Red-bellied</b> <b>macaws</b> {{are listed}} as [...] "least concern" [...] by the IUCN. Population numbers have not been estimated, but wild populations seem to be declining.|$|R
50|$|The area {{provides}} important {{habitat for}} waterfowl and is key habitat for the West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus)., caimans, anacondas, boa constrictors, red howler monkeys, white-fronted capuchin monkeys, numerous species of parrots, including both the blue-and-gold <b>macaw</b> and <b>red-bellied</b> <b>macaws,</b> {{as well as}} many wetland and savanna birds.|$|R
50|$|<b>Red-bellied</b> <b>macaws</b> nest in {{cavities}} of dead moriche palm trees. There {{are usually}} {{two to four}} white eggs in a clutch. The female incubates the eggs for about 27 days, and the chicks fledge from the nest about 77 days after hatching. Juveniles reach sexual maturity in 2-3 years.|$|R
50|$|This tree is {{important}} to many animal species; several bird species, such as the <b>red-bellied</b> <b>macaw,</b> sulphury flycatcher, and moriche oriole, use it for nesting and food. Tapirs, peccaries, fish and monkeys depend on the fruit.|$|E
50|$|It has a {{total length}} of {{approximately}} 36-43 cm (14-17 in). It has a moderately-sized black bill, a long tail and a mainly green plumage. The upperside of the remiges and primary coverts are blue, {{as indicated by}} its common name. The underside of the wings is yellowish, the tail-tip, crown and cheeks are bluish, and the tail-base and small belly-patch are red. The iris is amber. It and the <b>red-bellied</b> <b>macaw</b> are the only macaws where the bare facial-skin is yellowish, but this often fades to white in captivity. Unlike the <b>red-bellied</b> <b>macaw,</b> the blue-winged has a red lower abdomen and a red lower back.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>red-bellied</b> <b>macaw</b> (Orthopsittaca manilatus), {{also known}} as Guacamaya Manilata, is a medium-sized, mostly green South American parrot, {{a member of a}} group of large Neotropical parrots known as macaws. It is the largest of what are {{commonly}} called [...] "mini-macaws". The belly has a large maroon patch which gives the species its name.|$|E
50|$|Roystonea oleracea {{fruit is}} an {{important}} component of the diet of orange-winged amazon parrots and <b>red-bellied</b> <b>macaws</b> in Nariva Swamp, Trinidad and Tobago. Over the course of a study conducted between 1995 and 1996, R. oleracea fruit was an important element of the diet of both species between June and January, and was their dominant food item from July to November.|$|R
50|$|<b>Red-bellied</b> <b>macaws</b> make reedy, high-pitched screams. They roost communally in the moriche palms, {{and large}} numbers {{can be seen}} at the roost sites at dawn and dusk; (see crepuscular). They choose large stands of these palms that have an overabundance of {{woodpecker}} holes as roosting sites. They sleep communally in these groups of hollows. Depending {{on the size of the}} hollow, between five and 10 birds sleep together. As dusk approaches, they all pile into these dormitories and sleep shoulder to shoulder.|$|R
50|$|Bonadie and Bacon (1998) {{confirmed}} that roosting sites for orange-winged parrots (Amazona amazonica) and <b>red-bellied</b> <b>macaws</b> (Ara manilata Bodd.) were concentrated in Roystonea and Mauritia palm {{stands in the}} Nariva Swamp and they only counted 136 parrots (a reduction from 600 in 1969) and 224 macaws. The Conservation Ordinance allows orange-winged parrots to be shot as crop pests, so that if the palm swamp forest is eliminated they will become greater pests of cocoa and crops and will face greater levels of irate shooting. Parrots and macaws fed on seven plant species with the major concentration of feeding on Mauritia setigera and Roystonea oleracea palm fruit. The third psittacine species observed in the swamp were green-rumped parrotlets (Forpus passerinus Lafr.).|$|R
50|$|The <b>red-bellied</b> <b>macaw</b> has an {{extremely}} large range throughout the Amazon Basin of the North Region, Brazil, {{except in the}} northwest quadrant centered on a large region of the Rio Negro flowing from Colombia-Venezuela. It ranges through the Guianas including the Guiana Highlands into eastern Venezuela, the lower Orinoco River Basin and across to the island of Trinidad.|$|E
50|$|About 520 {{bird species}} have been {{reported}} in the park including: the blue-headed macaw, Spix's guan, the bat falcon, the <b>red-bellied</b> <b>macaw,</b> the sunbittern, the spangled cotinga, the king vulture, the white-necked jacobin, Chapman's swift, the ocellated poorwill, the pygmy antwren, the white-throated toucan, the jabiru, the golden-tailed sapphire, the Amazon kingfisher, the harpy eagle, the red-necked woodpecker, the scarlet macaw, the Amazonian royal flycatcher, etc.|$|E
50|$|Average annual {{rainfall}} is 1200 mm.Temperature {{ranges from}} 18 to 23 C, with average of 21 C.Vegetation includes trees up to 20 m high, with scattered Mata Mesofílica species among the Savannah species.There are distinct layers of savannah vegetation: grasses, shrubs up to 3 m, trees from 8 to 10 m and trees over 15 m.Endemic fauna include curl-crested jay (Cyanocorax cristatellus), peach-fronted parakeet (Eupsittula aurea), shrike-like tanager (Neothraupis fasciata), white-eared puffbird (Nystalus chacuru) and <b>red-bellied</b> <b>macaw</b> (Orthopsittaca manilatus).|$|E
50|$|The {{blue-headed}} macaw is 41 cm (16 in) long. It has mainly green plumage (often tinged olive, esp. below) with the head, flight feathers and primary coverts blue. The uppertail has a maroon base, a narrow green {{center and a}} blue tip. The undertail and underwing are greenish-yellow {{similar to that of}} several other small <b>macaws</b> (e.g. <b>red-bellied</b> and golden-collared <b>macaw).</b> The medium-sized bill is pale greyish-horn with a black base (extent varies, but upper mandible in adults typically appears mainly pale). The iris is whitish with a narrow, often barely visible, maroon eye-ring. Unlike most other macaws, the facial skin and lores are dark greyish. The legs are dull pinkish. Juveniles resemble adults, but with the entire bill black, greyer legs, darker iris and the facial skin and lores white.|$|R
50|$|Much remains {{uncertain}} {{about the extent}} of the bird's original range, because most of its woodland habitat was cleared before naturalists observed either the birds or the Caraiba nesting sites. The historical range is now believed to have encompassed portions of the states of Bahia and Pernambuco in a 50 km wide corridor along a 150 - 200 km stretch of the Rio São Francisco between Juazeiro (or possibly Remanso) and Abaré. Previous observations of the birds from further west are very difficult to explain but conceivably stem from either escaped captive birds or more likely the misidentification of another species such as <b>red-bellied</b> <b>macaw</b> (Orthopsittaca manilatus).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>red-bellied</b> <b>macaw</b> (Orthopsittaca manilata, Boddaert 1783) is {{a species}} of the {{monotypic}} genus Orthopsittaca (Ridgway 1912), one of six genera of Central and South American macaws. Gender agreement of species name follows David and Gosselin (2002b). It was formerly classified as Ara manilata (BirdLife International 2004, Sibley and Monroe 1990 & 1993, Stotz et al. 1996). The protonym was Psittacus manilatus. The genus name Orthopsittaca is from Gr. orthos straight; psittake parrot; lateral outline of cere straight or very faintly concave, without convexity in front of nostril” (Ridgway 1912); species name manilata / manilatus is from L. manus hand; latus broad, wide. Hence, [...] "a parrot with wide hands feet and straight nose cere".|$|E
50|$|It has a {{total length}} of about 38 cm, of which almost half is tail feathers. The general plumage is green, with a {{distinct}} yellow collar that is broadest {{on the back of}} the neck. The yellow collar develops as the bird ages, with more vibrant colors found in mature birds. The front and crown is brownish black. The remiges and primary coverts are blue and the long, pointed tail has a red base, a narrow green center and a blue tip. The underside of the tail and flight feathers are greenish-yellow, similar to that of several other small macaws such as the blue-winged and <b>red-bellied</b> <b>macaw.</b> The legs are a dull pinkish color, and the iris is reddish to dull yellow. It has extensive bare white facial skin and the heavy bill is black, often tipped pale grey.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>red-bellied</b> <b>macaw</b> is medium-sized, about 300 g {{in weight}} and about 46 cm in length {{including}} its long pointed tail. The plumage is mostly green; the cere {{and much of}} the face are covered with bare mustard-yellow skin, and the irises are dark brown. The forehead is bluish. The chin, throat and upper chest are greyish with some green scalloping, and the lower abdomen ("belly") has a large maroon patch. The tail is long and tapered. The underwings and undertail are dull olive yellow. Adults have dark-grey beaks. The legs and feet are dark grey. In common with other parrots, they have zygodactyl feet, two toes pointing forward and two backward. Males and females have identical plumage, but males are usually larger and have larger heads. Juveniles are duller in colour than adults and have a grey beak with a conspicuous white mid-line stripe running {{along the length of the}} culmen (top of the upper beak). [...] The Spix's macaw is the only other macaw in which juveniles have a similar white culmen.|$|E
