25|$|Thus, a zpool (ZFS storage pool) is vaguely {{similar to}} a computer's RAM. The total RAM pool {{capacity}} depends {{on the number of}} <b>RAM</b> <b>memory</b> sticks and the size of each stick. Likewise, a zpool consists of one or more vdevs. Each vdev {{can be viewed as a}} group of hard disks (or partitions, or files, etc.). Each vdev should have redundancy, otherwise if a vdev is lost, then the whole zpool is lost. Thus, each vdev should be configured as RAID-Z1, RAID-Z2, mirror, etc. It is not possible to change the number of drives in an existing vdev (Block Pointer Rewrite will allow this, and also allow defragmentation), but it is always possible to increase storage capacity by adding a new vdev to a zpool. It is possible to swap a drive to a larger drive and resilver (repair) the zpool. If this procedure is repeated for every disk in a vdev, then the zpool will grow in capacity when the last drive is resilvered. A vdev will have the same base capacity as the smallest drive in the group. For instance, a vdev consisting of three 500 GB and one 700GB drive, will have a capacity of 4Ã—500GB.|$|E
500|$|Programming was {{assigned}} to Tod Frye, who was not provided with any arcade design specifications to work from, and {{had to figure out}} how the game worked by playing it. The game uses a 4KB ROM cartridge, chosen for its lower manufacturing costs compared to 8KB cartridges, which had just become available at the time. After Atari acquired the rights to produce the game, Frye began work on a prototype version. The company wanted to release the prototype to capitalize on the 1981 holiday season. As with any contemporary arcade port, the simple Atari 2600 hardware was a considerable limitation. [...] The arcade PAC-MAN system board contained 2KB of main RAM (random-access memory) in which to run the program, 2KB of video RAM to store the screen state, and 16KB of ROM (read-only memory) to store the game code, whereas the Atari 2600 featured only 128 bytes of <b>RAM</b> <b>memory</b> and none dedicated to video: effectively 32 times less RAM. The Zilog Z80 CPU microprocessor used by the Namco Pac-Man arcade system is clocked at three times the speed of the MOS 6507 CPU in the Atari 2600, but the instruction sets and architecture for each processor are very different, and a 6507 can do more operations per clock cycle (effectively 2 to 1), making 1 to 1 comparisons more difficult than simply comparing clock speed.|$|E

In 1987, Commodore released the 64C computer, which is functionally identical to the original. The exterior design was remodeled in the sleeker style of the Commodore 128. The 64C uses new versions of the SID, VIC and I/O chips being deployed, with the core voltage reduced from 12V to 9V. Models with the C64E board had the graphic symbols printed {{on the top of the}} keys, instead of the normal location at the side. The sound chip (SID) were changed to use the MOS 8580 chip that uses other filter units, that results in [...] "samples" [...] almost being inaudible. The 64KB <b>RAM</b> <b>memory</b> went from eight chips to two chips. Basic and KERNAL went from two separate chips into one 16KB ROM chip.

The smaller physical space made it impossible to put in some internal expansions like a floppy-speeder. In the United States, the 64C was often bundled with the third-party GEOS graphical user interface (GUI) based operating system, as well as the software needed to access Quantum Link. The 1541 drive received a matching face-lift resulting in the 1541C. Later a smaller, sleeker 1541-II model was introduced along with the [...] 3.5-inch microfloppy 1581.|$|E
