5|$|Helper T cells {{regulate}} {{both the}} innate and adaptive immune <b>responses</b> <b>and</b> help determine which immune responses the body makes {{to a particular}} pathogen.

5|$|More recently, {{research}} at the Duke Lemur Center {{has shown that the}} ring-tailed lemur can organize sequences in memory and retrieve ordered sequences without language. The experimental design demonstrated that the lemurs were using internal representation of the sequence to guide their <b>responses</b> <b>and</b> not simply following a trained sequence, where one item in the sequence cues the selection of the next. But this is not the limit of the ring-tailed lemur's reasoning skills. Another study, performed at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve, suggests that this species along with several other closely related lemur species understand simple arithmetic operations.|$|E

5|$|Motor {{systems are}} {{areas of the}} brain that are {{involved}} in initiating body movements, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain. Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex <b>responses,</b> <b>and</b> contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control.|$|E
5|$|Social conditions, the {{standard}} of living and the self-confidence of the workers gradually improved due to industrialization between 1870–1916, but while {{the standard}} of living rose among the common people, the rift between rich and poor deepened markedly. The commoners' rising awareness of the socioeconomic and political questions interacted with the ideas of socialism, social liberalism and nationalism (Fennomania). The workers' <b>responses</b> <b>and</b> the corresponding counteracts of the dominating upper factions steepened the social relations in Finland.|$|E
5|$|Viral {{infections in}} animals provoke an immune {{response}} that usually eliminates the infecting virus. Immune responses {{can also be}} produced by vaccines, which confer an artificially acquired immunity to the specific viral infection. However, some viruses including those that cause AIDS and viral hepatitis evade these immune <b>responses</b> <b>and</b> result in chronic infections. Antibiotics {{have no effect on}} viruses, but several antiviral drugs have been developed.|$|E

5|$|Emotions are {{generally}} defined as two-step multicomponent processes involving elicitation, followed by psychological feelings, appraisal, expression, autonomic <b>responses,</b> <b>and</b> action tendencies. Attempts to localize basic emotions to certain brain regions have been controversial, with some research finding {{no evidence for}} specific locations corresponding to emotions, and instead circuitry involved in general emotional processes. The amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, mid and anterior insula cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex, appeared {{to be involved in}} generating the emotions, while weaker evidence was found for the ventral tegmental area, ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens in incentive salience. Others, however, have found evidence of activation of specific regions, such as the basal ganglia in happiness, the subcallosal cingulate cortex in sadness, and amygdala in fear.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XIII was {{positively}} received in Japanese magazines, garnering exceptionally high scores from both Famitsu and Dengeki PlayStation. In the west, {{the game was}} praised for its graphics, battle system, and music, but opinions were mixed about its story and it was criticized for its highly linear structure. XIII also won an award for best graphics in GamesRadars 2012 Platinum Trophy Awards. XIII-2 received a positive reception overall, gaining perfect scores from Famitsu and Dengeki PlayStation, and high scores from most western sites. Common points of praise were its non-linear nature, improved battle system and graphics, while the main points of criticism were its story and characters, which were often called weak, confusing or both. Lightning Returns received mixed to positive reviews, with its combat being highly praised, its graphics and time limit mechanic drawing mixed <b>responses,</b> <b>and</b> the story and characters being cited as poorly developed.|$|E
5|$|On DS9, Sisko informs Nog that he {{will not}} give him a {{recommendation}} as he has concerns that it is a scheme. Nog confesses that he wants to do it so that he doesn't turn out like his father Rom (Max Grodénchik), whom he describes as an engineering genius but his culture won't let him pursue it. Sisko, stunned by this confession of a Ferengi having such upstanding ambitions, responds by agreeing to recommend Nog to the Academy.

5|$|The Depression {{began in}} the United States in October 1929 and grew {{steadily}} worse to its nadir in early 1933. President Herbert Hoover feared that too much intervention or coercion by the government would destroy individuality and self-reliance, which he considered to be important American values. His laissez-faire views appeared to be shared by the Secretary of the Treasury Andrew W. Mellon. To combat with the growing economic decline, Hoover organized a number of voluntary measures with businesses, encouraged {{state and local government}} <b>responses,</b> <b>and</b> accelerated federal building projects. However his policies had little or no effect on economic recovery. Toward the end of his term, however, Hoover supported several legislative solutions which he felt might lift the country out of the depression. The final attempt of the Hoover administration to rescue the economy was the passage of the Emergency Relief and Construction Act (which provided funds for public works programs) and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) (which provided low-interest loans to businesses).|$|E
5|$|The Financial Times {{poll was}} the result of over 10,000 {{respondents}} to nearly 23000 electronic questionnaires of alumni from 155 qualifying business schools. The survey began in July 2006 and all internationally accredited programs that are at least five years old and that have produced at least 30 graduates {{in each of the last}} three years were solicited. 113 of the 155 had at least 20 respondents and at least a 20 percent response rate. The questionnaire used twenty criteria in three main areas. The poll actually presents all twenty criteria to the reader. Eight criteria are based on alumni responses; eleven criteria are based on business school <b>responses,</b> <b>and</b> the final criterion is based on a research index produced by the Financial Times.

40|$|The {{auditory}} {{brain stem}} <b>response</b> <b>and</b> the blink reflex were studied in 35 handicapped children {{in order to}} evaluate brain stem function. The auditory brain stem <b>response</b> <b>and</b> the blink reflex were abnormal in 20 and 16 cases, respectively. Of these, 14 had both auditory brain stem <b>response</b> <b>and</b> blink reflex abnormalities. The prevalence of auditory brain stem <b>response</b> <b>and</b> blink reflex abnormalities was high in severely handicapped children with difficulty in chewing or swal-lowing. The blink reflex was abnormal in four of 32 sides with a normal auditory brain stem <b>response</b> <b>and</b> 15 of 23 sides with an abnormal auditory brain stem response threshold, which reflects hearing loss or brain stem dysfunction. We conclude that the combined application of these two noninvasive tests is useful not only to delineate the extent of brain stem lesions but also {{to determine whether or}} not patients with an abnormal auditory brain stem response threshold have brain stem dysfunction. (J Child Neurol 1990; 5 : 40 - 44). It is difficult to clinically evaluate the brain stemfunction in children with neurological disor-ders.
