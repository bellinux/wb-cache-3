40|$|Even if {{the number}} of {{accidents}} involving the railway system is decreasing due to the technical progress, the statistics are still too high. For instance in 2004 in EU 25, 9309 accidents were reported, including 142 in France [ERA]. For each of these accidents in France, one element can be used as evidence {{in the eyes of the}} law: the <b>recording</b> <b>strip</b> and its associated filling-card or the so-called ATESS file recorded by digital Juridical Recording Units (JRU) introduced in the mid 80 s. The strip contains all the information concerning the journey of the train, speed and time recording and all the driving events (such as emergency breaking). The card features additional information on train’s driver, departure/arrival stations, number of trains, etc. These two elements are presently checked manually. The idea of this project is to simplify the procedure and to perform the checking as automatically as possible. This paper then aims at presenting a whole system for the Automatic Read of Recording Strips (ARRS) ...|$|E
40|$|For the 9000 train {{accidents}} reported {{each year}} in the European Union [1], the <b>Recording</b> <b>Strip</b> (RS) and Filling-Card (FC) related to the train activities represent the only usable evidence for SNCF (the French railway operator) and most of National authorities. More precisely, the RS contains information about the train journey, speed and related Driving Events (DE) such as emergency brakes, while the FC gives details on the departure/arrival stations. In this context, a complete checking for 100 % of the RS was recently voted by French law enforcement authorities (instead of the 5 % currently performed), which raised the question of an automated and efficient inspection of this huge amount of recordings. To do so, we propose a machine vision prototype, constituted with cassettes receiving RS and FC to be digitized. Then, a video analysis module firstly determines the type of RS among eight possible types; time/speed curves are secondly extracted to estimate the covered distance, speed and stops, while associated DE are finally detected using convolution process. A detailed evaluation on 15 RS (8000 kilometers and 7000 DE) shows very good results (100 % of good detections for the type of band, only 0. 28 % of non detections for the DE). An exhaustive evaluation on a panel of about 100 RS constitutes the perspectives of the work...|$|E

30|$|For anode fabrication, first, nickel strips are {{dipped in}} the {{prepared}} coating mixture above and dried in air. Air-dried strips are mechanically pressed and further dried in air and finally {{in a hot}} oven (100 °C). The weight of each dried <b>strip</b> is <b>recorded.</b> These <b>strips</b> are coated again, drying steps were repeated, and weights are <b>recorded.</b> <b>Strips</b> are pressed {{one more time and}} coated again and completely dried in air and hot oven. Heat treatment of PVDF-based CNS-Si anodes under argon atmosphere has been found to significantly improve the binder's adhesion to both CNS-Si particle-coated nickel strips and to the copper foil current collector, resulting in improved stability of the battery during cycling[30]. The final weight of each <b>strip</b> is <b>recorded.</b> These <b>strips</b> are used in battery assembly.|$|R

50|$|Commercial {{and naval}} fathometers of yesteryear used a strip chart {{recorder}} where an advancing roll of paper was marked by a stylus to make a permanent copy of the depth, usually with some means of also recording time (Each mark or time 'tic' is proportional to distance traveled) so that the strip charts could be readily compared to navigation charts and maneuvering logs (speed changes). Much of the world's ocean depths have been mapped using such <b>recording</b> <b>strips.</b> Fathometers of this type usually offered multiple (chart advance) speed settings, and sometimes, multiple frequencies as well. (Deep Ocean—Low Frequency carries better, Shallows—high frequency shows smaller structures (like fish, submerged reefs, wrecks, or other bottom composition features of interest.) At high frequency settings, high chart speeds, such fathometers give {{a picture of the}} bottom and any intervening large or schooling fish that can be related to position. Fathometers of the constant recording type are still mandated for all large vessels (100+ tons displacement) in restricted waters (i.e. generally, within 15 mi of land).|$|R
