40|$|There {{are many}} <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>retrofitting</b> {{flexible}} floor and roof diaphragms. Owners who occupy the building may retrofit {{to ensure the}} safety of their family. Landlords may wish to avoid future loss of income from a vacant and damaged building. Many insurance companies will not write earthquake or homeowners insurance until needed retrofitting is done. Also, some cities mandate seismic retrofits when enough square footage is added to the building. This report summarizes current retrofitting design practices for flexible diaphragms that function as part of the lateral force resisting system of a structure. It provides a thorough reasoning for the necessity of seismic rehabilitation of diaphragms in existing buildings. A complete description of the seismic rehabilitation process, from obtaining as-built information to the rehabilitation strategies. A full evaluation on the members which play a role in the performance of flexible diaphragms and retrofitting methods for each. 25...|$|E
40|$|Few people add siding {{or change}} their windows just {{to reduce their}} energy bills. But {{whatever}} your <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>retrofitting</b> your home, {{this will be an}} important opportunity to improve your home's energy efficiency. Not only will this reduce your utility bills, it will also improve your comfort level and improve our environment. Retrofitting your house is a big deal, and you shouldn't underestimate the effort that will be required to plan the job properly. The energy conservation rewards can be great, but there are also pitfalls that you'll want to avoid. That's what this Best Practices Guide is all about. We can't cover all the issues in these few pages, but we'll tell you some things you need to know if you're changing your siding or windows, and tell you where to learn more about other changes you may want to make to your house. What exactly is a ''best practice''? To put this guide together, we've tested products, talked to contractors and manufacturers, and reviewed the results from a large number of house retrofits. Of course, ''best'' will vary according to the situation. That's why you must start with a careful examination of your house and its existing condition...|$|E
40|$|The need <b>for</b> {{strengthening}} and <b>retrofitting</b> is {{well known}} and extensive research is progressing in this field. The <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> strengthening and <b>retrofitting</b> are numerous: increased loads, changes in use, deterioration, and so on. In recent years, the use of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) for strengthening has {{shown to be a}} competitive method, both regarding structural performance, and economical aspects. Extensive research has been carried out in this field. However, most of the research has been undertaken on concrete structures and for confinement, flexural, and shear strengthening. Limited research has been carried out on steel structures strengthened with CFRP. This paper presents axially loaded steel columns strengthened for increased load. The topic is studied theoretically and through laboratory tests. The theory covers analytical methods. Carbon fiber reinforced polymers has been used to strengthen the columns. The tests have been undertaken on full scale specimens, non-strengthened for reference, partially strengthened and fully strengthene...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{identify}} key drivers and barriers for {{the adoption of}} building energy retrofits in Germany, which is promoted by public policy as an important measure to address the future challenges of climate change and energy security. We analyze data from a 2009 {{survey of more than}} 400 owner-occupiers of single-family detached, semidetached, and row houses in Germany, that was conducted as a computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI). In the survey, respondents were asked directly <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> and against <b>retrofitting</b> their homes, but also faced a choice experiment involving different energy retrofit measures. Overall, both the descriptive and econometric results show that house owners who are able to afford it financially, for whom it is profitable, and for whom there is a favorable opportunity, are more likely to undertake energy retrofit activities. Based on an estimated mixed logit error component model, we also simulate the incentive effects of different policy options, such as public subsidies and energy tax increases...|$|R

The beam is loaded until cracking occurred. Retrofitting performed on beams that have been fractured by adding CFRP on the tensile reinforcement of reinforced concrete beams. The wide variationCFRP is used to repair the beam, which is 5 cm, 10 cm, and 15 cm. The results showed that the width of CFRP placed on the tensile reinforcement in reinforced concrete beam elements repair after damage affects the curvature ductility. The wider the CFRP used for the retrofit of reinforced concrete beams lead to the greater percentage decrease in ductility curvature...|$|R
