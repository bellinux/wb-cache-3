40|$|Environmental context. Recognising {{that road}} flares and air bags may {{contribute}} perchlorate to road runoff, we analysed perchlorate in runoff from two accident-prone suburban highways {{during a period}} of five rain events. This runoff reaches <b>recharge</b> <b>basins</b> where it then infiltrates into the groundwater. The concentrations of perchlorate averaged ∼ 2 µg L− 1, high enough to be of concern if the drinking water standard for perchlorate were in the low µg levels. Abstract. First flush samples of road runoff were sampled in April 2006 corresponding with five rain events at 12 catch <b>basins</b> and two <b>recharge</b> <b>basins</b> in Suffolk County, NY. Most runoff here is directed into <b>recharge</b> <b>basins</b> or sumps that drain directly into the sole source aquifer. Thus, contaminants from road runoff can contaminate groundwater. In addition to ClO 4, we present data for Cl, Na, Br, Sr, and nitrogen as nitrate (N-NO 3) as they are the dominant ions in the most probable sources of ClO 4 to road runoff, presumably road flares, road salt, air bags and road-side fertilizers. Correlations between the ions indicate that road salt elevates concentrations of Na, Br and Cl in road runoff. The average ClO 4 value is 2. 18 ± 0. 66 (standard error of the mean) µg L− 1 for the catch basins and 2. 98 ± 0. 87 µg L− 1 for the two <b>recharge</b> <b>basins.</b> Excess ClO 4 in the present study appears mainly from road flares.

Water may leak into the underground system from many sources including permeable earth, sinkholes, and losing streams. In some cases entire creeks seemingly disappear as the water sinks into the ground via the stream bed. Grand Gulf State Park in Missouri is an example of an entire creek vanishing into the groundwater system. The water emerges 9 mi away, forming some of the discharge of Mammoth Spring in Arkansas. Human activity may also affect a spring's discharge—withdrawal of groundwater reduces the water pressure in an aquifer, decreasing the volume of flow.|$|E

The ability to predict the impact of foulant accumulation on basin percolation facilitates evaluation of the potential effectiveness of cleaning strategies or water pretreatment schemes in improving percolation efficiency. In this study, both laboratory and field data were used to develop a relatively simple mathematical model capable of describing basin percolation kinetics. This model suggests that initial percolation rate, foulant loading and the interaction between foulant and sediment {{at or near the}} sediment/water interface can describe the decay of percolation over time.

In addition to this, {{there seems to be no}} seasonal constraint on this mechanism, in that the loss of nitrate from the system occurs throughout the year.

40|$|The thesis {{covers the}} {{investigation}} of the storm water runoff and artificial recharge components of the Atlantis Water Resource Management Scheme in the Southwestern Cape. The objective {{of the study was to}} obtain an in-depth knowledge of the process of artificial recharge of urban storm water runoff, in order to identify the most efficient recharge management strategy for the Atlantis aquifer. To achieve the objective it was necessary to first study the existing knowledge on urban storm water hydrology and artificial recharge by spreading, and to create a conceptual model of what might be expected. The study area was then investigated to examine how closely the actual situation was reflected by the conceptual model, enabling recommendations to be made for the sound management of the system. The stormwater runoff component was found to differ from most urban hydrological studies as a result of its large baseflow component. The sandy nature of the catchment, small percentage area of effective impervious surface, and high groundwater table resulted in the baseflow constituting more than 40 % of the total storm water runoff and accounting for over 60 % of the pollution load. The "first flush" effect established as a major source of pollution in other studies, was found to be of minor significance in this study area. The overall stormwater quality (excluding the noxious industrial baseflow) was found acceptable for artificial recharge within the study area, although the baseflow from the industrial sub-catchments showed the potential for being a major source of pollution in the future. The treated wastewater used for artificial recharge prior to 1987 was found to be unacceptable for recharge purposes. The treated industrial effluent should under no circumstances be recharged up-gradient of the Witzand well field. The treated domestic effluent although of a poorer quality than the resident Witzand well field groundwater could be recharged in order to boost recharge volumes and form a buffer against further intrusion by the poor quality groundwater from the Brakkefontein area. This would however only be acceptable if strict water quality control is maintained and recharge does not take place west of the present basin. The <b>recharge</b> <b>basin</b> was found to be well situated with respect to influencing the Witzand wellfield and maintaining a groundwater buffer against poor quality groundwater flow from the northeast towards the central area of the wellfield. Unfortunately the surrounding low-lying topography and sandy retaining walls have resulted in return flow and raised groundwater-levels. The raised groundwater mound does not comply with the conceptual model and together with the sandy nature of the unsaturated zone resulted in less effective purification during infiltration. The practice of letting large portions of the basin floor dry-out during summer was shown to be beneficial and the periodic cleaning of the deeper portions of the basin essential. The artificially recharged water was found to have influenced the upper portion of the aquifer well beyond the West Coast Road. The study of groundwater quality being a good method for tracing artificially recharged water. The groundwater quality has improved as a result of artificial recharge since the removal of treated wastewater from the <b>recharge</b> <b>basin.</b> The groundwater was (ii) found to be very responsive to the slightest changes in <b>recharge</b> <b>basin</b> water quality or/and quantity. Management of the <b>recharge</b> <b>basin</b> therefore had to be very much of a compromise between qualitative and quantitative approaches. The present approach of recharging all the stormwater runoff throughout the year providing the most efficient compromise under the present conditions. The study revealed that the most efficient recharge management strategy would be the recharge of treated domestic sewage effluent in the present <b>recharge</b> <b>basin</b> and all residential storm water runoff plus industrial "storm flow" starmwater runoff in a new <b>recharge</b> <b>basin</b> located northwest of the present basin.
