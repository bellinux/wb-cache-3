40|$|AbstractKnowledge {{spillover}} {{occurs when}} <b>recipient</b> <b>firms</b> combine {{the knowledge of}} an originating firm with other knowledge. When <b>recipient</b> <b>firms</b> combine the originating firm's knowledge with knowledge that is unfamiliar to the originating <b>firm,</b> the <b>recipient</b> <b>firms</b> potentially provide insight to the originating firm on the viability of exploring such knowledge. By mimicking its <b>recipient</b> <b>firms,</b> the originating firm reduces the challenge and uncertainty of exploring unfamiliar knowledge domains. We examine the exploration activities of 87 telecommunications equipment manufacturers over a ten-year time period. We argue that those firms that operate in competitive and dynamic market environments promoting conservative risk-taking behavior will value such uncertainty reduction more highly and thus rely {{to a greater extent}} on their <b>recipient</b> <b>firms</b> for guidance on where to explore for new expertise. In contrast, firms in high-growth market environments are more likely to look beyond the activities of <b>recipient</b> <b>firms</b> when exploring new technological domains and rely less on mimicking their <b>recipient</b> <b>firms...</b>|$|R
40|$|The article {{considers}} knowledge spillover as a {{means by}} which firms can gain insight into new knowledge domains. The occurrence of a knowledge spillover is described as when <b>recipient</b> <b>firms</b> exploit knowledge that was originally developed by another firm. The role of learning vicariously from the innovative activity of <b>recipient</b> <b>firms</b> in the innovation process of the originating firm is explored. The authors argue that the extent to which firms emulate the innovative behavior of their <b>recipient</b> <b>firms</b> depends largely on the environment in which they find themselves.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, most {{emerging}} markets {{have been associated}} with new investment opportunities and some growth prospects that attract private equity (hereafter, PE) investors. Regions with growing interest of PE investments include Africa and Asia. Research on PE impact on <b>recipient</b> <b>firms</b> in developed economies are voluminous and has proven that PE plays a remarkable role in firms’ success. Until now, such performance implications on firms in emerging markets are limited in study. Our study focuses on the impact of PE funding on financial performance of firms in emerging markets using Ghana as a case. Using data from both the investors and fund recipients of PE, we empirically assess how the presence and ownership stake of PE investors affect financial performance of <b>recipient</b> <b>firms.</b> We also investigate the influence of post-investment corporate governance mechanisms on the overall financial performance of the <b>recipient</b> <b>firms.</b> We find that, PE backed firms have relatively higher returns on equity (ROE) and growth rate than listed firms though the differences are not statically significant. Also, we find that <b>recipient</b> <b>firms</b> with higher PE ownership stake have high ROE and growth rate than <b>recipient</b> <b>firms</b> with lower PE ownership stake. These findings recapitulate that, though PE investment significantly affects the performance of <b>recipient</b> <b>firms</b> positively, the PE industry is still at a growing stage and young in most emerging markets hence long-term benefits of PE investments would take time to be realized. We also find that PE <b>recipient</b> <b>firms</b> that involve the founders in management irrespective of the stake acquired by the PE investors outperform listed firms in terms of ROE. Finding on the board size of the <b>recipient</b> <b>firms</b> proves that, large board size affects ROE negatively. We therefore conclude that infusion of PE funds, through minority or majority stake, invariably, has a positive influence on recipient firms’ financial performance but higher stake enhances such stimuli. Also, corporate governance mechanisms {{play a major role in}} enhancing the positive relationship between PE and financial performance of <b>recipient</b> <b>firms.</b> Our findings are robust and they are empirically and theoretically supported. The findings should however be generalized with caution. This is because, as literature suggests, performance improvements that result from PE may take time to be realized and institutional context may also limit the generalisability of the finding among emerging markets that have vast institutional differences from Ghana.

40|$|This {{research}} {{contributes to}} the literature on resource, knowledge and capability transfer in international joint ventures. In mainstream international business literature, few empirical studies have been undertaken at the micro-organization level on the extent to which, and ways in which recipients benefit from the resources and knowledge transferred from the foreign partner in an IJV. This study explores the transfer content, context, process and effects from the recipient’s perspective. Measures of the acquisition/learning intentions of the <b>recipient</b> <b>firm</b> and the transfer benefits, including transfer channels and learning mechanisms, are drawn from a synthesis of international business, international management, knowledge management and knowledge transfer and learning literature. A business function-related knowledge typology by Pak and Park (2004) among a number of other knowledge typologies was adapted to specifically examine the types and extent of resources and knowledge transferred from the foreign partner to the <b>recipient</b> <b>firm</b> among four Sino-foreign IJVs in the auto parts and animal feed sectors. They were compared using quantitative and qualitative measures of the types and levels of acquisition and learning intentions, the transfer benefits within and outside the IJVs, and transfer channels and learning mechanisms they have developed. The findings highlighted the micro-organization processes of transfer and learning in IJVs that bring together parent firms from very different business contexts. Firstly, the ‘alignment’ or ‘fit’ between the source and recipient in the JV partnership influences the nature and level of resulting benefits. The measures of ‘success’ vary from firm to firm, being strongly influenced by the learning intentions in line with the initial level of resources, experience and knowledge of the <b>recipient</b> <b>firm.</b> Cross-sector differences, especially the combination impact of different levels of Chinese Government departments on the learning intentions and transfer benefits were revealed. Transfer channels and learning mechanisms vary according to the type of knowledge that is transferred, and the source and recipient firms’ particular organizational characteristics. The recipient firm’s organizational development strategy, aspects of wider organizational absorptive capacity and the motives of individuals were found to be important in facilitating technological spillovers and counteracting the foreign partner’s efforts to protect certain knowledge and processes. Overall, this research adds insights to previous studies of IJVs by emphasizing the context-specific nature of the transfer and acquisition/learning intentions, processes and outcomes.

40|$|Without {{considering}} {{differences in}} operating environment, {{traditional methods of}} efficiency evaluation are suffering from external environmental influences. This study presents an alternative approach for assessing the relative efficiency of government-sponsored research and development projects (GSP). A three-stage approach employing data envelopment analysis to evaluate efficiency and Tobit regression to control external variables was applied to 110 projects over 9 years. This study finds that firm size, industry, and ratio of public subsidy {{on research and development}} (R&D) budget of <b>recipient</b> <b>firm</b> significantly influences the technical efficiency of GSP in Taiwan. After controlling these external variables, the mean value of technical efficiency in the third stage increases and becomes significantly different to that in the first stage.

We use a production function framework to estimate the impact of technology transfer from FDI on the growth of sales of domestic firms in Estonia during the period from 1994 to 1999. Employing panel data techniques, we control for industry and firm specific effects and use a Heckman two-stage procedure to control for sample self-selection bias. We find that the magnitude of the spillover effect depends on the characteristics of incoming FDI and, of the <b>recipient</b> local <b>firm.</b> More specifically, spillovers vary with the measure of foreign presence used, and are is influenced by the <b>recipient</b> <b>firm’s</b> size, its ownership structure and its trade orientation...|$|R

To guide practice on divestitures, we {{investigate the}} role of the recipient and the number and characteristics of the divested products by simulating post-merger outcomes for all relevant cases. We find that in this setting with large multiproduct firms, the competition authority's most effective means to dampen adverse postmerger outcomes are to aim for a small <b>recipient</b> <b>firm</b> and attain a large number of divested products. Enforcing larger divestitures in terms of market share and raising the average cross-price elasticity between the merging parties' divested and retained products strengthen the dampening effect further. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Empirical {{examination}} of whether R&D subsidies crowd out private investments has been hampered by selection problems. A particular worry is that project quality and research intentions may {{be correlated with}} the likelihood of receiving subsidies. Using proposal evaluation data to control for research intentions, we do not find strong evidence suggesting {{that this type of}} selection creates a severe bias. Proposal evaluation grades strongly predict R&D investments and reduce selection bias in cross‐sectional regressions, but there is limited variation in grades within firms over time. Hence, in our sample, unobserved project quality is largely absorbed by firm fixed effects. Our best estimate of the short‐run additionality of R&D subsidies is 1. 15, i. e., a one‐unit increase in subsidy increases total R&D expenditure in the <b>recipient</b> <b>firm</b> by somewhat more than a unit. We demonstrate, however, that there is measurement error in the subsidy variable. Additionality is therefore likely to be underestimated...|$|E
40|$|Using enterprise-level {{data from}} 21 low and middle income economies in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, this paper looks at factors that {{influence}} whether enterprises in these countries {{are connected to the}} Internet.

Further, there is evidence of positive externalities from foreign investment, with foreign direct investment increasing Internet access among domestic enterprises other than the <b>recipient</b> <b>firm.</b> In particular, the paper finds evidence of ‘spillover effects’, where enterprises directly competing with foreign-owned enterprises and imports are more likely to have Internet connections than similar enterprises that compete mainly with domestically owned enterprises.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} multinational corporations (MNCs) as the creator and diffuser of new and superior technologies. If these firms fulfil this attributed role, then {{they are expected to}} generate some spillovers to domestic industries in host economies. Theoretical and empirical studies propose that domestic technological capability is also important in this process. Our study addresses the question of productivity spillovers from the activity of MNCs, whether size of the <b>recipient</b> <b>firms</b> and the R&D intensity matter in this respect, and do spillovers change by time. The analysis utilizes a longitudinal data for the Turkish manufacturing industry in 28 3 - digit level industries over the 1983 - 2000 period. Our results suggest that the spillovers from MNCs for the domestic sector of the Turkish manufacturing industry differentiate with respect to size of the <b>recipient</b> domestic <b>firms</b> and by time. Despite that, the evidence tends to speak in favor of negative spillovers in the Turkish manufacturing industry. Productivity spillovers, Multinational Corporations, Turkey. ...|$|R

This is done through a specific type of source team knowledge, the design, and through the NPD process in industries (clothing and construction) where it plays a key role. NPD cases were analyzed and clustered in three categories of design absorption processes. From these categories, a conceptual framework of the source-recipient knowledge com- plementarity and its impact on theNPDperformance is proposed. The main result is that the complementarity between the recipient and the source knowledge is a crit- ical aspect of the absorption process and therefore of the NPD performance.

To account for endogeneity of R&D effort in the knowledge production function, we estimate a Heckman selection model on R&D decisions. Results support the view that R&D intensity is positively linked to firm size, age and human capital endowment as well as to higher exposure to international competitive pressure. Then, the knowledge production function is estimated using a standard probit, where the probability to innovate of each firm depends upon intramural R&D effort, regional and industrial spillovers and on a vector of interaction and control variables. Our measures of external knowledge, which circulates and potentially transfers across firms belonging to the same geographical or industrial spaces, are based on predicted values for R&D effort in the region and industry respectively.
