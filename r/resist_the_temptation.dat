5|$|Delayed gratification, or {{deferred}} gratification, is {{the ability}} to <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> <b>temptation</b> for an immediate reward and wait for a later reward. Generally, delayed gratification is associated with resisting a smaller but more immediate reward in order to receive a larger or more enduring reward later. A growing body of literature has linked the ability to delay gratification to a host of other positive outcomes, including academic success, physical health, psychological health, and social competence.|$|E

5|$|The 1969–70 season {{opened with}} {{victory in the}} 1969 FA Charity Shield, as Bremner captained Leeds to a 2–1 victory over Manchester City. With new arrival Allan Clarke played upfront {{alongside}} Mick Jones and Peter Lorimer Revie had to instruct Bremner and Giles to <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> <b>temptation</b> to get forward and attack. It took the team some time to gel, as only two wins came from the opening eight league games, and Leeds eventually finished a distant second to champions Everton. They chased Everton all season only {{to give up on}} the title after a home defeat by Southampton late in the campaign. In the European Cup Leeds recorded a club record 10–0 win over Norwegian side Lyn, with Bremner netting two of the goals. However they exited the competition at the semi-final stage after two defeats to Celtic; Bremner levelled the aggregate score by putting United 1–0 ahead in front of a competition record 136,505 spectators at Hampden Park, but Celtic came back to win the game and the tie with two second half goals. Further disappointment came in the 1970 FA Cup Final, where Leeds were beaten 2–1 in extra-time of the replay at Old Trafford. Bremner was named as FWA Footballer of the Year for the season.|$|E

500|$|The {{difficulties}} in compiling a works list for Josquin cannot be overstated. Because of his immense prestige {{in the early}} sixteenth century, many scribes and publishers did not <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> <b>temptation</b> of attributing anonymous or otherwise spurious works to Josquin.

500|$|Most Christian {{authors who}} wrote of Raynald in the 12th and 13th centuries were {{influenced}} by Raynald's political opponent, William of Tyre. The author of the Estoire of Eracles stated that Raynald's attack against a caravan {{at the turn of}} 1186 and 1187 was the [...] "reason of the loss of the Kingdom of Jerusalem". Modern historians have usually also treated Raynald as a [...] "maverick who did more harm to the Christian than to the [...] cause". Runciman describes him as a marauder who could not <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> <b>temptation</b> presented by the rich caravans passing through Oultrejordain. Runciman argues that Raynald attacked a caravan during the 1180 truce because he [...] "could not understand a policy that ran counter to his wishes". According to Barber, Raynald's behavior during the reign of Guy of Lusignan shows that the kingdom had broken up into [...] "a collection of semi-autonomous fiefdoms" [...] by that time.|$|E

Walter Hart, the club's chairman, spoke of the good character of the players, most of whom still worked at their own trades when not required for football, suggesting that [...] "a man who had nothing to do but loaf about from week's end to week's end was not ready for play, and such a mode of life was not conducive to good football".

He also narrates the following story: Shortly after Harpalus ran away from Athens, he was put to death by the servants who were attending him, though some assert that he was assassinated. The steward of his money fled to Rhodes, and was arrested by a Macedonian officer, Philoxenus. Philoxenus proceeded to examine the slave, [...] "until he learned everything about such as had allowed themselves to accept a bribe from Harpalus." [...] He then sent a dispatch to Athens, in which he gave a list of the persons who had taken a bribe from Harpalus. [...] "Demosthenes, however, he never mentioned at all, although Alexander held him in bitter hatred, and he himself had a private quarrel with him." [...] On the other hand, Plutarch believes that Harpalus sent Demosthenes a cup with twenty talents and that [...] "Demosthenes could not <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> <b>temptation,</b> but admitting the present, ... he surrendered himself up to the interest of Harpalus." [...] Tsatsos defends Demosthenes's innocence, but Irkos Apostolidis underlines the problematic character of the primary sources on this issue—Hypereides and Dinarchus were at the time Demosthenes's political opponents and accusers—and states that, despite the rich bibliography on Harpalus's case, modern scholarship has not yet managed to reach a safe conclusion on whether Demosthenes was bribed or not.|$|E
500|$|The Emancipation of Mimi {{received}} a 64 out of 100 (indicating [...] "generally positive reviews") on Metacritic, a website that averages professional reviews from critics into a numerical score. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called the album a [...] "highly crafted piece of dance-pop" [...] and [...] "relative comeback" [...] for Carey, {{although it is}} not as [...] "catchy" [...] as he thought it should have been. Erlewine voiced a common criticism of the album: that Carey's voice seemed [...] "damaged" [...] in comparison to her [...] "glory years" [...] in the 1990s. He commented that in the belted songs such as [...] "Fly Like a Bird" [...] and [...] "I Wish You Knew", Carey's voice sounded [...] "as airy, thin, and damaged as it did on Charmbracelet". Michael Paoletta from Billboard was less critical of her vocals, writing that [...] "while her voice has lost some of the power through the years, Mimi deftly showcases her still-considerable pipes with strong lyrics and slick production." [...] Paoletta praised The Emancipation of Mimi as Carey's best album since Butterfly (1997). Michael Dougall Bell from the Calgary Sun called Carey's voice [...] "very impressive". He concluded: [...] "While Emancipation may not send Carey's stock or star back up to where it once was and where that voice deserves to be, at least she's not plummeting – she's merely levelled off." [...] Entertainment Weekly editor Tom Sinclair noted that almost every song [...] "showcases Carey's undeniable vocal strengths". Reviewing [...] "Fly Like a Bird", Sinclair concluded, [...] "It's so moving that we'll <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> <b>temptation</b> to be crass and interpret the song as a plea for heightened record sales. Help from above is always welcome, but Emancipation sounds like it just might do fine all on its own." ...|$|E

500|$|The 19th century {{transcription}} of Merina oral history, Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara, relates that Andriamampandry privately {{assessed the}} leadership qualities {{of each of}} the four selected sons, with disappointing results. He presented Andriambonimena of Alasora with a beautiful parrot, which the prince killed and served as food. The elder concluded that he was [...] "a gun that loads itself." [...] The oldest son, Andrianjakanavalonamandimby, was given a pot of honey, which he smashed in order to eat every last drop. Afterward Andriamampandry remarked that the kingdom had become a pot of honey without a lid, implying the first one to come along would be free to reach his hand inside and take all its bounty for himself. He visited Andriantomponimerina at Ambohidratrimo and offered him a zebu kidney (considered unpalatable), which the prince ordered to be prepared as a meal nonetheless, leading the elder to remark, [...] "This man can't even <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> <b>temptation</b> to eat the kidney." [...] He visited Andrianavalonimerina at Ambohitrabiby carrying a lemon and a weaver's stake, which the prince's wife demanded he give to them, demonstrating their greediness. Andriamampandry also visited prince Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana at Ambohimanga, carrying an axe and a rope. The prince asked to borrow the two items, then ordered a servant to use the axe and rope to butcher a zebu, put some of the best meat in a basket, cook the rest of the good meat for their meal, and set aside the neck and the ribbed part of the tripe in a second basket. The elder dined with the prince and spent the night at the village. When Andriamampandry was about to leave, the prince returned the rope and axe, gave him the basket of fine meat for his wife, and gave him the second basket, declaring [...] "These are the parts for the axe (i.e. the neck) and the rope (i.e. the striated omasum)." [...] Andriamampandry was deeply impressed by the hospitality and foresight of the prince. He related these incidents to Andriamasinavalona, who decided to test his sons in turn by calling them together to his house, then observing how they slept on the bed they shared there. Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana had his head highest on the pillow, but Andriamasinavalona failed to understand the significance of this, and Andriamampandry rebuked him, remarking [...] "You are the king, and yet you do not understand?" ...|$|E
