50|$|Many local {{operations}} use a <b>reeling</b> <b>machine</b> <b>for</b> this task, {{but the majority}} of most silk thread is still hand-reeled. The difference is that hand-reeled threads produce three grades of silk: two fine grades that are ideal for lightweight fabrics and a thick grade for heavier material.|$|R
25|$|Silk is {{produced}} year-round in Thailand by {{two types of}} silkworms, the cultured Bombycidae and wild Saturniidae. Most production is after the rice harvest in the southern and northeastern parts of the country. Women traditionally weave silk on hand looms and pass the skill on to their daughters, as weaving {{is considered to be}} a sign of maturity and eligibility for marriage. Thai silk textiles often use complicated patterns in various colours and styles. Most regions of Thailand have their own typical silks. A single thread filament is too thin to use on its own so women combine many threads to produce a thicker, usable fiber. They do this by hand-reeling the threads onto a wooden spindle to produce a uniform strand of raw silk. The process takes around 40 hours to produce a half kilogram of silk. Many local operations use a <b>reeling</b> <b>machine</b> <b>for</b> this task, but some silk threads are still hand-reeled. The difference is that hand-reeled threads produce three grades of silk: two fine grades that are ideal for lightweight fabrics, and a thick grade for heavier material.|$|R
50|$|Ferrari is a {{manufacturer}} of two and four wheel tractors devoted to agriculture and lawn care. It was created in 1954, during the agricultural reconstruction period of the country. After an initial period dedicated {{to the production of}} wire-drawing <b>machines</b> <b>for</b> <b>irrigation</b> pipes, in 1957 Ferrari took part in the Verona exhibition with its first agricultural machine: the two-wheel tractor MC 57, which carries the date of its birth. In 1965 Ferrari launched the first articulated tractor MT65. The range of products was increased to motor mowers and tractors for diverse applications. At the end of the 1960s, the company looked to foreign markets; the subsidiary company Ferrari France was established in 1972. In 1988 Ferrari became part of the BCS Group. Today Ferrari has a wide range of machines between maintenance <b>machines</b> <b>for</b> recreational use and professional tractors for niche agriculture. Headquarters and factories are located at Abbiategrasso.|$|R

40|$|During the {{cultivation}} of crops, irrigation is included in necessary working operations like tillage, fertilization and sowing. <b>For</b> <b>irrigation,</b> we require the highest quality of work. Therefore, in this contribution, we focused on monitoring the quality of work of a hose <b>reel</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>machine.</b> <b>For</b> determining the longitudinal uniformity of winding a hose on a reel, {{the development of a}} digital device was necessary. During the development, we had to design its two basic parts – the hardware and software. After construction of the device, its function was tested directly in working conditions of the particular <b>reel</b> hose irrigation <b>machine.</b> The results of our developed device were compared with the results of the Ecostar 4000 (Bauer, Austria) microcomputer, both with the same hose winding speed. On the microcomputer, we set the hose winding speed to + 2. 1 m*h- 1. The average measured value of speed using the first device Speedmeter SM 1 (2000, KSVS) was 11. 7 m*h- 1. The difference between the set and measured speed was 0. 4 m*h- 1 (absolute error of measurement, the relative error of measurement was 3. 42 %). In the second case, the measurement was performed using a more modern device – Speedmeter SM 2, which allows saving of results into its internal memory (2012, KSVS). The average measured value of winding speed was 12. 26 m*h- 1, which represents the relative error of measurement 2. 77 % compared to the set value of 12. 6 m*h- 1. Based on the results obtained, we recommend the maintenance of the irrigation machine...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the main}} {{differences}} between video slot <b>machines</b> and <b>reel</b> <b>machines</b> is in the way payouts are calculated. With <b>reel</b> <b>machines,</b> {{the only way to}} win the maximum jackpot is to play the maximum number of coins (usually 3, sometimes 4, or even 5 coins per spin). With video machines, the fixed payout values are multiplied by the number of coins per line that is being bet.

50|$|The station {{signed on}} with a very-short-lived country music format. This was {{followed}} by a light-popular music format ("pop for adults"). CFMI was distinguished in its earlier years by being a technical innovator of early automation systems. Stereo automation systems of the day relied heavily on reel-to-reel tape <b>machines</b> <b>for</b> music. CFMI's automation had no <b>reel</b> <b>machines,</b> but relied totally on cartridge carousels, which allowed greater programming flexibility ("random access"), but no broadcast cartridges of the day could reproduce quality stereo. The response of CFMI's engineers was to invent a new cartridge that could: the Aristocart. Parent company Western International Communications went on to develop a manufacturing division, exporting these improved cartridges to broadcasters around the world. Today's broadcasters use computer systems with large hard drives to reproduce music digitally, and have no need of tape systems. But in its heyday (circa 1975-1990), the Aristocart was an improvement to a technical problem shared by all commercial stereo broadcasters.|$|R

5000|$|A {{problem with}} three <b>reel</b> <b>machines</b> {{is that the}} number of {{combinations}} is only cubic [...] - [...] the original slot machine with three physical reels and 10 symbols on each reel had only 103 = 1,000 possible combinations. This limited the manufacturer's ability to offer large jackpots since even the rarest event had a likelihood of 0.1%. The maximum theoretical payout, assuming 100% return to player would be 1000 times the bet, but that would leave no room for other pays, making the machine very high risk, and also quite boring.|$|R
