5|$|Before {{entering}} a stage, the player {{begins in the}} Attraction Information Center, which acts as a hub world. Here, the player can choose a partner and a level to enter, and see which attractions they have already completed. Bonus levels are hidden throughout the zones and can also be triggered by finishing a zone with 20 or more <b>rings.</b> <b>In</b> the bonus levels, the player is free falling and can pick up power-ups as they proceed. Special stages can be entered if finishing a zone with 50 or more <b>rings.</b> <b>In</b> these, the player must collect blue spheres in a forward-scrolling platformer; players are rewarded with a Chaos Ring upon completion. Collecting all Chaos Rings rewards the player with the best possible ending, in which Sonic and Tails make cameo appearances.|$|E
5|$|Common toads {{can live}} {{for many years}} and have survived for fifty years in captivity. In the wild, common toads are thought to live for about ten to twelve years.

50|$|However, the {{two main}} contestants are always given an {{opportunity}} to answer first if they <b>ring</b> <b>in,</b> even if it is later than the spoiler. This results in a five-way system in which the order of <b>ringing</b> <b>in</b> is displayed on the front of each podium, 1 or 2 on the main contestant's podiums, and 1, 2, or 3 on the spoilers'. Should all five players <b>ring</b> <b>in</b> on a question, the host can ask each of the main contestants for an answer in the order they <b>rang</b> <b>in</b> before moving on to the spoilers in the order they <b>rang</b> <b>in</b> (should no one provide the correct answer) by using the numbers on the podiums.|$|R

5|$|Despite his {{involvement}} in union business he {{continued to be a}} busy working actor. He appeared in Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon (1975) as a nobleman friend of the title character. His last television work was an episode of the ITV series The Professionals in 1978, the year of his death. The animated film version of The Lord of the <b>Rings,</b> <b>in</b> which he voiced the character of Elrond, was released the same year, but his final film work was not seen until the year after his death. This was as the judge in The First Great Train Robbery.|$|E
5|$|Each game also {{features}} three toss-up puzzles, which reveal the puzzle one random letter at a time, and award cash to whoever <b>rings</b> <b>in</b> {{with the right}} answer. The first determines who is interviewed first by the host, the second determines who starts round 1, and the third determines who starts round 4. Respectively, the toss-ups are valued at $1,000, $2,000, and $3,000. In addition to these, each game has a minimum of four rounds, with more played if time permits. Rounds 2 and 3 are respectively started by the next two contestants clockwise from the contestant who began round 1.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, a state ensign {{was created}} {{specifically}} for non-military vessels engaged in non-commercial government service; this defaces the Italian tricolour {{with the national}} coat of arms. Since 1914, the Italian Air Force have also used a roundel of concentric <b>rings</b> <b>in</b> the colours of the tricolor as aircraft marking; substituted, from 1923 to 1943, by encircled fasces. The Frecce Tricolori, officially known as the 313º Gruppo Addestramento Acrobatico, is its aerobatic demonstration team.|$|E
5|$|In 2003–2005, the Hubble Space Telescope {{detected}} {{a pair of}} previously unknown rings, now called the outer ring system, which brought the number of known Uranian rings to 13. These rings were subsequently named the μ and ν rings. The μ ring is the outermost of the pair, and is twice {{the distance from the}} planet as the bright η ring. The outer rings differ from the inner narrow <b>rings</b> <b>in</b> a number of respects. They are broad, 17,000and 3,800km wide, respectively, and very faint. Their peak normal optical depths are 8.5×10−6 and 5.4×10−6, respectively. The resulting equivalent optical depths are 0.14km and 0.012km. The rings have triangular radial brightness profiles.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>ring</b> <b>in</b> {{which all}} {{elements}} are idempotent {{is called a}} Boolean ring.

5|$|Like {{previous}} games, Sonic collects golden rings, which {{protect him}} from a single hit by an enemy or obstacle, though they will scatter and blink before disappearing. Sonic starts {{the game with a}} limited number of lives; if he is hit with no <b>rings</b> <b>in</b> his possession, he will lose a life. If a player exhausts their lives, they will receive a game over.|$|E
5|$|Noether's work Abstrakter Aufbau der Idealtheorie in algebraischen Zahl- und Funktionenkörpern (Abstract Structure of the Theory of Ideals in Algebraic Number and Function Fields, 1927) {{characterized}} the <b>rings</b> <b>in</b> which the ideals have unique factorization into prime ideals as the Dedekind domains: integral domains that are Noetherian, 0 or 1-dimensional, and integrally closed in their quotient fields. This paper also contains what now {{are called the}} isomorphism theorems, which describe some fundamental natural isomorphisms, and some other basic results on Noetherian and Artinian modules.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we study}} {{integral}} semihereditary orders over a valuation <b>ring</b> <b>in</b> a finite-dimensional simple Artinian <b>ring.</b> <b>In</b> {{the first section}} we prove that such orders are extremal.

5|$|Some {{harmless}} {{milk snake}} (Lampropeltis triangulum) subspecies, the moderately toxic false coral snakes (genus Erythrolamprus), and the deadly coral snakes (genus Micrurus) {{all have a}} red background color with black and white / yellow <b>rings.</b> <b>In</b> this system, both the milk snakes and the deadly coral snakes are mimics, whereas the false coral snakes are the model. It has also been suggested that this system could be an instance of pseudomimicry, the similar colour patterns having evolved independently in similar habitats.|$|E
5|$|The {{bog turtle}} spends its life almost {{exclusively}} in the wetland where it hatched. In its natural environment, it has a maximum lifespan of perhaps 50 years or more, and the average lifespan is 20–30 years. The Bronx Zoo houses several turtles 35years old or more, the oldest known bog turtles. The zoo's collection has successfully sustained itself for more than 35years. The age of a bog turtle is determined by {{counting the number of}} <b>rings</b> <b>in</b> a scute, minus the first one (which develops before birth).|$|E
5|$|The game {{contains}} {{two types of}} bonus stages accessed by passing a checkpoint with at least 20 rings. The first type has Sonic or Knuckles orbit floating, glowing spheres, jetting off each one when a button is pressed, while a fence of light approaches from the bottom and will remove the player from the stage if touched. Collecting 50 <b>rings</b> <b>in</b> this stage earns the player a continue. The second type involves bouncing around {{a room with a}} slot machine in its center with the intention of winning extra lives and power-ups.|$|E

5|$|The {{integers}} {{have additional}} properties {{which do not}} generalize to all commutative rings. An important example is the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which says that every positive integer can be factored uniquely into prime numbers. Unique factorizations do not always exist in other rings, but Noether found a unique factorization theorem, now called the Lasker–Noether theorem, for the ideals of many rings. Much of Noether's work lay in determining what properties do hold for all <b>rings,</b> <b>in</b> devising novel analogs of the old integer theorems, and in determining the minimal set of assumptions required to yield certain properties of rings.|$|E
5|$|The peak {{brightness}} of the μ ring lies almost exactly on the orbit of the small Uranian moon Mab, which is probably {{the source of the}} ring’s particles. The ν ring is positioned between Portia and Rosalind and does not contain any moons inside it. A reanalysis of the Voyager 2 images of forward-scattered light clearly reveals the μ and ν <b>rings.</b> <b>In</b> this geometry the rings are much brighter, which indicates that they contain much micrometer-sized dust. The outer rings of Uranus may be similar to the G and E rings of Saturn as E ring is extremely broad and receives dust from Enceladus.|$|E
5|$|The {{rings of}} Neptune, {{like those of}} Uranus, {{are thought to be}} {{relatively}} young; their age is probably significantly less than that of the Solar System. Also, like those of Uranus, Neptune's rings probably resulted from the collisional fragmentation of onetime inner moons. Such events create moonlet belts, which act as the sources of dust for the <b>rings.</b> <b>In</b> this respect the rings of Neptune are similar to faint dusty bands observed by Voyager 2 between the main rings of Uranus.|$|E
