40|$|Active sonar {{reverberation}} returns {{offer the}} possibility to invert for geo-acoustic bottom parameters to characterise the underwater environment. We present the results of synthetic inversions of reverberation <b>returs</b> generated with a ray-based reverberation model in which bottom scattering is modelled according to a modified Lambert's rule. The inverted parameters are sediment sound speed, attenuation and the scattering strength, parametrised by Lambert's constant and a low grazing angle threshold. The sediment density is calculated during the inversions through an empirical relationship to sediment sound speed. Results of inversions of synthetic data using a genetic algorithm are presented both for a soft muddy bottom and a harder and rougher bottom consisting of coarse sand. We also investigate the effect of an error in water depth...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Repeat {{transurethral}} resection (<b>ReTUR)</b> {{is an effective}} treatment for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) to prevent disease recurrence or progression. It also has {{an important role in}} stratifying patients according to histopathological results. Therefore, the end point of <b>ReTUR</b> should be considered in a treatment algorithm. We evaluated positive <b>ReTUR</b> to define its role in a treatment algorithm for NMIBC. Materials and Methods: A second TUR was performed in 111 patients between July 2006 and February 2010. A third TUR was performed in 31 patients with T 1 /a/is tumors at the second TUR. The incidence of residual disease was calculated according to the NMIBC risk levels proposed by the International Bladder Cancer Group. We used <b>ReTUR</b> as a general term to indicate second and third TURs. Results: Residual disease at the second TUR was detected in 51 % of the patients; it was observed in 17 %, 45 %, and 65 % patients in the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk disease groups, respectively (P = 0. 01). Residual disease at the third TUR was detected in 48 % patients; it was observed in 18 % and 65 % patients in the intermediate- and high-risk disease groups, respectively (P = 0. 06). Conclusion: The incidence of residual disease correlated with the risk levels for NMIBC. In the intermediate-risk disease group, nearly complete resection was accomplished after the third TUR. However, in the high-risk disease group, a high incidence of residual disease was identified even after the third TUR. Our results provide important data that may be useful in establishing an end point in a treatment algorithm for NMIBC...|$|E
