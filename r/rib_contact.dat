5|$|Pseudoryzomys has 19 or 20thoracic (chest) and lumbar vertebrae, 13 {{of which}} bear ribs, as is {{characteristic}} of oryzomyines. The first <b>ribs</b> <b>contact</b> both the seventh cervical (neck) vertebra and the first thoracic vertebra, an important character of the Sigmodontinae. Unlike in most sigmodontines, including Holochilus and Lundomys, the fourth lumbar vertebra lacks the processes known as anapophyses. There are three or four sacral and about 29caudal (tail) vertebrae. Between {{the second and third}} caudal vertebrae, separate bones called hemal arches are present. These display a spinous process at the back, as in both Holochilus and Lundomys. On the humerus, the upper arm bone, the entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; in some other cricetids, it perforates the far (distal) end of the humerus.|$|R
50|$|According to Padian, eight cervical, {{fourteen}} dorsal, {{three or}} four sacral and twenty-seven or twenty-eight caudal vertebrae are present. The exceptional fourth sacral {{is the first of}} the normal caudal series. The number of caudals is not certain because their limits are obscured by long thread-like extensions, stiffening the tail. The cervical vertebrae are rather long and strongly built, their upper surface having a roughly square cross-section. They carry double-headed thin cervical ribs. The dorsal vertebrae are more rounded with flat spines; the first {{three or four}} carry <b>ribs</b> that <b>contact</b> the sternal ribs; the more posterior <b>ribs</b> <b>contact</b> the gastralia. The first five or six, rather short, caudal vertebrae form a flexible tail base. To the back the caudals grow longer and are immobilised by their intertwining extensions with a length of up to five vertebrae which together surround the caudals with a bony network, allowing the tail to function as a rudder.The breastbone is triangular and relatively small; Padian has suggested it may have been extended at its back with a cartilaginous tissue. It is connected to the coracoid which in older individuals is fused to the longer scapula forming a saddle-shaped shoulder joint. The humerus has a triangular deltopectoral crest and is pneumatised. The lower arm is 60% longer than the upper arm. From the five carpal bones in the wrist a short but robust pteroid points towards the neck, in the living animal a support for a flight membrane, the propatagium. The first three metacarpals are connected to three small fingers, equipped with short but strongly curved claws; the fourth to the wing finger, in which the second or third phalanx is the longest; the first or fourth the shortest. The wing finger supports the main flight membrane.|$|R
30|$|A similar {{investigation}} for 2 D current collection <b>ribs</b> at different <b>contact</b> resistances is also made. Again, {{for all the}} cases, the power densities increase when the control area decreases and the current collector width is optimized. Contact resistances significantly affect the maximum output power.|$|R
25|$|A nearly {{complete}} sacrum consisting of six vertebrae was {{recovered from the}} quarry, originally only lacking some ribs. The original description of Huabeisaurus suggested that only five sacral vertebrae were present {{based on the number}} of sacral ribs and intercostal foramina. The sacrum is currently heavily restored with plaster, but pre-restoration photographs show the sacrum in two oblique dorsal views and right lateral view. These photographs reveal that the last dorsal vertebra was taphonomically shifted posteriorly and to the right, crushing the right first sacral rib. Pre-restoration photographs and the number of broken sacral neural spines currently visible indicate that the sacrum was composed of at least six vertebrae. The first vertebra crushed into the sacrum could represent a seventh sacral vertebra; because the ribs of this dorsal vertebra are not observable firsthand or in photographs, but it cannot be verified whether or not these <b>ribs</b> <b>contacted</b> the ilium. The vertebra was interpreted as the last dorsal vertebra because: its neural spine does not appear to be fused to the neural spine posterior to it, and the usual sacral vertebral count for all but the most basal somphospondylans is six (with seven vertebrae in Neuquensaurus as the only derived exception).|$|R

50|$|Chinlechelys can be {{distinguished}} from both derived amniotes and primitive turtles based on the below features, noticed by Joyce et al.: {{the presence of a}} plastron, carapace and multi-element neck and tail armour; a dorsal centra hourglass-shaped, platycoelous, and with a distinct ventral keel; dorsal <b>ribs</b> in <b>contact</b> two dorsal vertebrae; the appearance of compressed dorsal ribs that are oriented vertically and only lightly associated with overlying dermal armour; a double contact between the dorsal vertebrae and dorsal ribs only incipient; the carapace and most of plastron laminar in thickness; a carapace with distinct medial ridge that widens towards the end; a plastron with a sloping inguinal notch; and neck armour prongs forming an angular cone.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{three-dimensional}} finite element modelling of the ribbed strip rolling is carried out, coupling {{the use of}} an extremely thin array of elements that is equivalent to the calculation of the additional shear deformation work rate occurred by the velocity discontinuity in the roll bite. The formulation of the finite element modelling by adding a <b>rib</b> inclined <b>contact</b> surface boundary condition is derived, and the performance of the proposed method is conducted. The simulated rib height, forward slip, and the pulling down of rib height have been compared with the measured values and are in good agreement. The equivalent strain rate of the rib was obtained in the simulation. The effect of the rib inclined angle on pulling down of rib height has also been discussed, which is helpful in optimizing the design of the rib inclined angle...|$|R
5000|$|The Brenneke slug was {{developed}} by the German gun and ammunition designer Wilhelm Brenneke (1865-1951) in 1898. The original Brenneke slug is a solid lead slug with ribs cast onto the outside, much like a rifled Foster slug. There is a plastic, felt or cellulose fiber wad attached to the base that remains attached after firing. This wad serves both as a gas seal and as a form of drag stabilization. The [...] "ribs" [...] impart a small amount of rotation to the projectile as it travels down the bore. This rotation does not impart gyroscopic stabilization, rather it improves accuracy by correcting for manufacturing irregularities. [...] Additionally, the <b>ribs</b> decrease <b>contact</b> surface with the bore, reducing friction and increasing velocity. The ribs also deform through the choke more readily than a solid slug would, thus reducing pressure and wear on the choke to safe levels.|$|R
40|$|A {{main feature}} of complex strip - ribbed strip is the {{significant}} local residual deformation {{on a flat}} strip, resulting in the pulling down of rib height. The interesting issue in this paper shows a developed three-dimensional finite element model of the complex strip rolling, coupling {{the use of an}} extremely thin array of elements which is equivalent to the calculation of the additional shear deformation work rate occurred by the velocity discontinuity in the deformation zone. The 3 D finite element modelling includes the consideration of the special <b>rib</b> inclined <b>contact</b> surface boundary condition has been carried out on a computer. An examination of the equivalent stress field, forward slip and rib height demonstrates the effectiveness of the developed model. The computed forward slip and rib height are in good agreement with the measured values. The effect of the rib inclined angle on the pulling down of rib height is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of cell design on solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) stack performance. Based on 3 -dimensional {{numerical}} simulations, {{it is found that}} the performance of stack is strongly dependent on cell design. The average current density of the anode-supported SOFC (ASC) stack is only 5580 A m- 2, a reduction of 20. 7 % from the cathode-supported SOFC (CSC) stack of 7033 A m − 2 This can be explained that compared with CSC stack, thin cathode in ASC stack leads to the smaller effective reaction zone and the larger cathode ohmic losses. The discrepancy between the ASC stack and the CSC stack are examined by varying <b>rib</b> width, <b>contact</b> resistance and pitch width. The results show conclusively that with the optimal rib width, the performance of the CSC stack is much superior to that of the ASC stack for any practical contact resistance and pitch width. The analyses provided in this paper assist in understanding {{the effect of}} cell design on cell performance in the stack level and playing the full potential of the stack by optimizing the cell design...|$|R
50|$|The {{cypriniformes}} (family Cyprinidae) {{are traditionally}} grouped with the Characiformes, Siluriformes, and Gymnotiformes {{to create the}} superorder Ostariophysi, since these groups share some common features. These features include being found predominantly in fresh water and possessing Weberian ossicles, an anatomical structure derived from the first five anterior-most vertebrae, and their corresponding ribs and neural crests. The third anterior-most pair of <b>ribs</b> is in <b>contact</b> with {{the extension of the}} labyrinth and the posterior with the swim bladder. The function is poorly understood, but this structure is presumed {{to take part in the}} transmission of vibrations from the swim bladder to the labyrinth and in the perception of sound, which would explain why the Ostariophysi have such a great capacity for hearing.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work a {{finite element method}} (FEM) model was {{developed}} to investigate {{the impact of the}} flowfield design on the performance of a planar SOFC repeat unit. The 2 -D FEM model, which considers the performance data of an ideal contacted cell, the electrical conductivities of the electrode materials and the contact resistance between the electrodes and the metallic interconnectors, provides the electrical potential and current density distribution in the repeat unit. Simulations and experimental studies for different flowfield / <b>contact</b> <b>rib</b> geometries were performed to evaluate the cell performance decrease due to the in plane ohmic losses in the electrode and the contact resistance. Experimental and modeling data are in good agreement. With respect to anode supported cells, the flowfield design on the cathode side has a significant impact (up to 48 % power loss) on the cell performance, whereas the flowfield design in the anode is of minor importance (< 1 % power loss) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMyogenin and MRF 4 are {{skeletal}} muscle-specific bHLH transcription factors {{critical for}} muscle development. In {{addition to a}} variety of skeletal muscle defects, embryos homozygous for mutations in myogenin or MRF 4 display phenotypes in the thoracic skeleton, including rib fusions and sternal defects. These skeletal defects are likely to be secondary because myogenin and MRF 4 are not expressed in the rib cartilage or sternum. In this study, the requirement for myogenin and MRF 4 in thoracic skeletal development was further examined. When a hypomorphic allele of myogenin and an MRF 4 -null mutation were placed together, the severity of the thoracic skeletal defects was greatly increased and included extensive rib cartilage fusion and fused sternebrae. Additionally, new rib defects were observed in myogenin/MRF 4 compound mutants, including a failure of the <b>rib</b> cartilage to <b>contact</b> the sternum. These results suggested that myogenin and MRF 4 share overlapping functions in thoracic skeletal formation. Spatial expression patterns of skeletal muscle-specific markers in myogenin- and MRF 4 -mutant embryos revealed early skeletal muscle defects not previously reported. MRF 4 −/− mice displayed abnormal intercostal muscle morphology, including bifurcation and fusion of adjacent intercostals. myogenin/MRF 4 -mutant combinations displayed ventral myotome defects, including a failure to express normal levels of myf 5. The results suggested that the early muscle defects observed in myogenin and MRF 4 mutants may cause subsequent thoracic skeletal defects, and that myogenin and MRF 4 have overlapping functions in ventral myotome differentiation and intercostal muscle morphogenesis...|$|R
