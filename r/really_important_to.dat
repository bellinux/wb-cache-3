25|$|During this period, the MWRC {{networked}} {{with community}} cultural leaders through the Kimberley Aboriginal Law and Cultural Centre (KALACC), an Aboriginal organisation {{that supports the}} traditional practices of the 30 language groups in the Kimberley. Oscar revealed the significance of their support in the alcohol restriction campaign:It was <b>really</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> let elders know what was happening. We liaised with cultural leaders and elders through KALACC. KALACC helped facilitate approval from elders for the alcohol restrictions.The role of KALACC was critical; {{it would have been}} very interesting had they not supported the campaign. The support of KALACC managed some of the forces in the community.Oscar’s move to get the backing of elders and cultural leaders was a major factor in persuading the Director of Liquor Licensing to impose the alcohol restrictions and should not be underestimated. Certain sectors of the community were against the restrictions and the support from elders gave the MWRC campaign the legitimacy it needed in enduring strong criticism. In the face of fierce opposition from some members of her community who had a vested interest in the sale of alcohol, Oscar stood firm. She knew the restrictions would give her people much needed relief from the trauma and chaos caused by alcohol abuse.|$|E

They were no longer dole reliant, as they had been when they made their debut album, Parables for Wooden Ears. Drummer Jon Coghill told The Sydney Morning Herald [...] "we wanted to have more fun and enjoy that we were a band, rather than chase what you're supposed to do", and guitarist Ian Haug said [...] "We all found that this is <b>really</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> us, but we wanted to make it more fun".|$|E

Clements stated that Benson's voice had a unique [...] "sweetness" [...] and [...] "youthfulness". When recording the vocals for [...] "Part of Your World", Benson asked that {{the lights in the}} studio be dimmed, to create the feeling of being deep under the sea. [...] "Part of Your World", which was referred to by songwriter Howard Ashman as the [...] "I Want" [...] song, was originally going to be cut from the final film, owing to Jeffrey Katzenberg's belief that it slowed the story down, but Ashman and Keane fought to keep it in.|$|E

Kohl's describes Abbey Dawn as a [...] "juniors lifestyle brand", which incorporates skull, zebra, and star patterns, purples and [...] "hot pinks and blacks".

500|$|The Rolling Stones {{needed to}} find a new guitarist, and the {{recording}} sessions for the next album, Black and Blue (UK 2; US 1) (1976) in Munich provided an opportunity for some hopefuls to work while trying out for the band. Guitarists as stylistically disparate as Peter Frampton and Jeff Beck were auditioned as well as Robert A. Johnson and Shuggie Otis. Both Beck and Irish blues rock guitarist Rory Gallagher later claimed that they had played without realising they were being auditioned, and both agreed that they would never have joined. American session players Wayne Perkins and Harvey Mandel also tried out but Richards and Jagger had a preference for the band to remain purely British. When Ronnie Wood auditioned, everyone agreed that he was the right choice. He had already recorded and played live with Richards, and had contributed to the recording and writing of the track [...] "It's Only Rock 'n Roll". He had earlier declined Jagger's offer to join the Stones, because of his commitment to the Faces, saying [...] "that's what's <b>really</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> me". Faces' lead singer Rod Stewart {{went so far as to}} say he would take bets that Wood would not join the Stones.|$|E
500|$|Two {{weeks prior}} to the group {{starting}} university, they decided that they would take a second gap year, and perform new material which the band felt did not suit their current outfit. Cave stated that [...] "I felt as though I couldn't write about anything personal, so I would make up semi-comical stories that weren't <b>really</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> anyone, not even me." [...] Fear of Flying disbanded in October 2007 with a MySpace bulletin stating [...] "Fear of Flying is DEAD ... White Lies is alive!", before introducing a darker sound and a new name that reflected their maturity. Cave stated that the band deleted their MySpace account [...] "without any token farewell gigs". McVeigh said that the current musical climate {{had an effect on}} the split, stating that [...] "Maybe a few years ago, we would have signed a deal and had a chance to make three albums [...] In the current climate...we’d have been dropped". When asked about the name change in an interview with a radio station in San Francisco, Jack Brown said that [...] "We just thought that we should perform these songs as a different band. We had songs that we felt weren't suitable for the band that we were in and we thought White Lies would be the perfect vehicle for the songs." ...|$|E

Sheff explained that [...] "interiority is a <b>really</b> <b>important</b> thing <b>to</b> me, {{and a lot of}} this record did come from a subconscious, unconscious place, and I wanted it to respond to that corresponding place in listeners...

Her sexual orientation was announced {{at the same time}} the character was revealed in the spring of 2006. Stories appeared on television news outlets such as CNN, general news magazines such as USA Today, and gay culture magazines such as Out. The modern Katherine [...] "Kate" [...] Kane made her first comic book appearance in issue #7 of the maxi-series 52 (2006), where Kane is revealed to have been romantically involved with Renee Montoya, a former Gotham City Police detective (who later takes up the mantle of the Question after the original hero dies). When questioned about the editorial decision to make Batwoman a gay character in an interview with Wizard Entertainment, DC Comics Senior Vice President and Executive Editor Dan DiDio stated [...] "It was from conversations we’ve had for expanding the DC Universe, for looking at levels of diversity. We wanted to have a cast that is much more reflective of today’s society and even today’s fanbase. One of the reasons we made her gay is that, again when you have the Batman Family—a series of characters that aren’t super-powered and inhabit the same circle and the same city—you really want to have a point of difference.

500|$|The {{on-screen}} {{relationship between}} Dot and Jim was halted in 2007 when Jim was hastily written {{out of the}} soap due to Bardon's health problems. In the script Jim suffered a stroke and {{was placed in the}} care of off-screen relatives. Dot and Jim remained together, with Jim making sporadic appearances between 2008 and 2009 to visit Dot. A more permanent return for the character was announced in 2009. However, it was reported in April 2011 that Bardon had filmed his exit from the series, and that the show's staff believed it marked the end of the character. A source told the Daily Mirror: [...] "Dot's been struggling for a while and realises that she can no longer give Jim the care and attention he deserves and is forced to make the heartbreaking decision that he should move into a home. [...] It was very emotional on the set for the scenes where Dot discusses her decision and talks to Jim about him going into care for good. There were a lot of tears. [...] The feeling is that {{this is the end of}} Jim as a character because he won't leave the home and won't ever be a regular in Albert Square again." [...] It was reported that Jim could still appear in the care home if Bardon's health permitted it. Jim left the show on 26 May 2011. Brown opined that Dot would feel lonely without Jim, saying, [...] "I think she'll be very lonely and feel she doesn't have much purpose in life. It was <b>really</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> tell this story because there are so many people in a similar situation to Dot. It was moving to act out, too—not just because of Dot and Jim's relationship, but because I'm really good friends with John Bardon in real life." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's playable character, William [...] "B.J." [...] Blazkowicz, {{has been}} {{previously}} featured as the playable protagonist of all Wolfenstein games. When developing the character of Blazkowicz for The New Order, MachineGames considered his appearances in previous games in the series. When doing this, they realised that the character had never really developed at all throughout the games; [...] "He's just the guy that you play," [...] said Pete Hines, Vice President of PR and Marketing for Bethesda. The team discovered that {{they were interested in}} exploring his story, which is what they later invested in. One particular scenario that the team envisioned is putting Blazkowicz in situations where he is uncomfortable. Matthies said, [...] "that's really interesting to me. I love taking things and making them real." [...] Throughout the game, Blazkowicz communicates some of his inner thoughts through short monologues, many of which reveal that he has been traumatized by some of his experiences. [...] "We always loved the idea of a prototypical action hero exterior juxtaposed with a rich and vulnerable interior psychology," [...] said Matthies. One of the largest priorities for the team when developing the character of Blazkowicz was to [...] "reveal whatever needs to be revealed to [...] and the player" [...] simultaneously; Matthies felt that, despite the simplicity of this concept, it is rarely used in games. Prior to developing The New Order, the team had primarily worked on games that involved antihero protagonists. However, id Software wished Blazkowicz to be portrayed differently in the game. Matthies said, [...] "It's <b>really</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> [...] that BJ is a hero, and not an anti-hero." [...] The team attempted to develop Blazkowicz into a character that players could relate to, as they felt that players are generally unable to relate to video game protagonists. [...] "The goal is not to have a protagonist that's so neutral that you can project yourself into them; the goal is to have a protagonist that is so relatable that you become them," [...] said Matthies. They also tried to make players become [...] "emotionally in sync" [...] with Blazkowicz, using the morality choice in the game's prologue to do so.|$|E
