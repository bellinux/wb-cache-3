40|$|A {{platform}} for sliding <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> and centrifugal pump tests is installed {{to study the}} series operation of them under different characteristics of pipeline. Firstly, the sliding <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> and the centrifugal pump work independently, and the performance is recorded. Then, {{the two types of}} pumps are combined together, with the sliding <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> acting as the feeding pump. Comparison is made between the performance of the independently working pump and the performance of series operation pump. Results show that the system flow rate is determined by the sliding <b>vane</b> <b>pump.</b> In order to ensure the stability of the series operation pumping system, the energy consumption required by the pipeline under the system flow should be greater than the pressure energy centrifugal pump can generate. Otherwise, the centrifugal pump can not operate stably, with reflux, swirl, gas-liquid two-phase flow in the runner and strong vibration and noise.

50|$|In a {{hydraulic}} installation, one pump can serve several cylinders and motors. However, {{in that case}} a constant pressure system is required and the system always needs full power. It is more economic to give each cylinder and motor its own pump. In that case, multi-pump assemblies can be used. Gear pumps are often supplied as multi-pumps. The different chambers (sometimes of different sizes) are mounted in one body or built together. <b>Vane</b> <b>pumps</b> and gerotor pumps too are often available as multi-pumps. Screw pumps can be combined with gear or <b>vane</b> <b>pumps.</b> Axial piston swashplate pumps can be combined with a second pump, or {{with one or more}} gear <b>pumps</b> or <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> (the gear or <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> often serving as flush pumps for cooling larger units).

As the product of delivery pressure and discharge works for the pressure variation in the casing, the booster is more available when it has an additional tank. The expansion line close to the suction port of a pump works as same as the booster, and its work becomes more effective as its vertical height increased. 　The <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> without <b>vane</b> pins will be safely operated by effective control of back pressure to the grooves for the vanes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This work {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of surface roughness of cam contours on friction torque in a hydraulic balanced <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> and it is verified that smoothing {{the surface of the}} cam contour can reduce friction torque. In the <b>vane</b> <b>pump,</b> the friction torque arising from the friction between a cam contour and vane tips is significant. In this article, first, the values of the coefficient of friction between the vane tip and its sliding surfaces were measured by using cylindrical test rings with various kinds of surface roughness. Then the torque characteristics of <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> having cam ring contours with various values of surface roughness were measured and their results compared with the results of an analysis of the coefficient of friction investigated using test rings. As a result, the friction torque caused by the friction between the cam contour and the vane tip was reduced by lessening the surface roughness of the cam contour, resulting in an improvement of the mechanical efficiency. The coefficient of friction measured by using the test rings could be applied to the actual <b>vane</b> <b>pumps...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paperdescribes the {{theoretical}} analysis on themechanical efficiencyof ahydraulic-balanced <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> and presents a design concept to decide {{values such as}} vane thickness and cam lift to improve its mechanical efficiency. In this paper, the friction torque characteristics of the balanced <b>vane</b> <b>pump,</b> especially the friction torque caused by the friction between a camcon-tour and vane tips are both experimentally and theoretically investigated. Although the friction force increaseswith vane thickness increasedue to increase in the vane force, themechanical effi-ciency of the vane pumpdoes not decreasewhen the cam lift becomes large as the vane thickness is increased. An important parameter 1 defined as the ratio to be obtained by dividing the cam lift by the vane thickness determines essentially the mechanical efficiency of the <b>vane</b> <b>pump.</b> The pumps with the same 1 have the same mechanical efficiencies, even if the cam lift or the vane thickness varies. A larger value of 1 leads the <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> to obtain a higher mechanical efficiency although the limit of vane strength governs the upper limit for 1. Additionally, reducing the friction coefficient of the vane tip contributes to improvement of the mechanical efficiency...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the major}} {{advantages}} of the <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> is that the design readily lends itself to become a variable-displacement pump, rather than a fixed-displacement pump such as a spur-gear (X-X) or a gerotor (I-X) pump. The centerline distance from the rotor to the eccentric ring is {{used to determine the}} pump's displacement. By allowing the eccentric ring to pivot or translate relative to the rotor, the displacement can be varied. It is even possible for a <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> to pump in reverse if the eccentric ring moves far enough. However, performance cannot be optimized to pump in both directions. This can make for a very interesting hydraulic-control oil pump.|$|R

40|$|<b>Vane</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are simple}} in {{principle}} {{and can be}} mass produced inexpensively, making them well suited to the automotive industry. They also have many other applications, {{such as in the}} chemical industry and food industry. A common type of damage to a <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> is cavitation erosion on the side plates. If this damage is not detected in time, it could cause failure of the pump, which {{depending on the type of}} system may have safety implications, and in some cases a high cost from lost production whilst the system is shut down. This kind of damage is common on other types of pumps such as gear pumps and piston pumps. So a practical method for fault diagnosis of hydraulic pumps is required which does not necessitate removal of a pump from the working system. This paper presents a method of detecting and identifying cavitation damage on pump side plates via pump flow ripple. Power steering <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> are used for this study, although the principles may also be applicable to other types of <b>vane</b> <b>pump,</b> and indeed to piston and gear pumps. The investigation has been done through measurement and simulation. A numerical model of a <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> is described, and simulated cavitation damage is introduced into the model. This damage is shown to have a clear effect on the simulated flow ripple. The pump flow ripple has also been measured experimentally using the Secondary Source Method, and artificial damage has been introduced into the pump. The damage is shown to have a clear effect on the measured flow ripple, consistent with the simulation results. Whilst the secondary source enables the measurement of flow ripple in laboratory conditions, it is generally impracticable for in-situ measurement for condition monitoring. A simplified method for calculation of pump flow ripple from in-situ pump pressure ripple measurements and system impedance is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. High {{contact stress}} between the vane tips and the cam ring {{is one of}} the main {{obstacles}} to improve the working pressure of a water hydraulic <b>vane</b> <b>pump.</b> A pressure-reducing valve for regulating the bottom pressure of the <b>vanes</b> at the <b>pump</b> suction zone is presented in this paper. Through optimization and simulation, it is found that the throttle structure has great influence on the dynamic performance of the pressure-reducing valve, and the triangular-rectangular groove is proved to be more suitable for the valve among all the investigated grooves. The theoretical analysis results show that the use of the pressure reducing valve can obviously reduce the contact forces between the cam ring and the vanes at the suction zone of the pump. The work in this research provides a feasible solution to improve the working pressure of a water hydraulic <b>vane</b> <b>pump...</b>|$|R
40|$|In modern {{vehicles}} {{the steering}} systems are still widely equipped with power-assisted steering pumps. In most cases <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> are used which limit the fluid volume flow in dependence of required pressure and running speed {{by a special}} design of the internal control valve. This control valve internally redirects the volume flow inside the pump leading still to unnecessary fluid circulation. Variable displacement pumps now offer an additional opportunity to eliminate the internal volume flow in dependence of the required load with reduced losses and hence increased efficiency. This is realized by a variable adjustment of the displacement cells, but simultaneously the variable force and load distributions inside the pump make the acoustic optimization even more difficult. In this paper the kinematics of the <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> are modelled with a combined analytical and numerical approach. The data out of this model are used as input data for the hydraulic model of the variable displacement <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> with a commercial tool.

40|$|Variable {{displacement}} <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> represent one of {{the most}} innovative type of pump for automotive engines. The <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> with a sliding ring, is a mechanism that makes it possible to change the capacity of the pump {{as a function of the}} engine speed, allowing to optimize of the oil flow, according to the engine demand, with considerable power saving. The main components of a variable displacement <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> are: <b>vanes,</b> rotor, inner rings and a sliding ring. During operation, the vanes are in contact with the inner surface of the outer (sliding) ring due to the effect of centrifugal loads; in addition high slip velocities occur in the contact area; as a consequence, a critical aspect of this kind of pumps is represented by the wear which takes place on the contact surfaces. Another potential mechanism of damaging process is attributed to vanes sticking in rotor cavities, causing a sudden increase in contact loads. This paper illustrates a summary of a research activity, which was carried out with the aim of analyzing the operating conditions of <b>vanes</b> <b>pumps.</b> The study was conducted with reference to <b>pumps</b> with <b>vanes</b> number ranging from 5 to 9, in order to evidence the influence of some design parameters on results. The numerical analysis were carried out by using multi-body models, that were developed with MSC. Adams® code.
