5|$|In the Southern Hemisphere, {{commercial}} fishing for the porbeagle is mostly undocumented. Substantial numbers are caught incidentally by pelagic longline fisheries targeting more valuable {{species such as}} southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii), swordfish (Xiphius gladius), and Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), including vessels operated by Japan, Uruguay, Argentina, South Africa, and New Zealand. Porbeagle catches by the Uruguayan tuna pelagic longline fishery peaked in 1984 with 150 tons landed. <b>Records</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> per unit effort (CPUE) for this fishery have shown a 90% decline in porbeagle landings from 1988 to 1998, though it is uncertain whether this reflects a real population decline or changing fishing habits.

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20 th century, marine partyboat fishing in California was a wealthy man's sport, but 30 years later, the nucleus of the present day fleet of about 400 partyboats was forming. The development of the fleet from 1936 to 1967 is traced in brief, including mention of the influence of governmental agencies on safety, food handling, communications, employment, <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch,</b> and taxes. A study of fleet activities for one year, 1963, is presented and reveals some economic facts of partyboat life. During the 21 year period, 1947 – 1967, the statewide marine partyboat fleet reported a <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> over 71 million fish. Annual totals ranged from 2. 0 to 5. 4 million fish. Salmon, striped bass, rockfish, and lingcod have been the primary species sought and taken from Oregon to Point Arguello, whereas off southern California the California barracuda, kelp and sand bass, California yellowtail, Pacific bonito, and California halibut were the most important species. Of the 20 most important partyboat game fishes in the southern California fishery, all except one entered the commercial fishery...|$|R

40|$|Trolling may be {{conducted}} {{from a small}} boat thereby requiring a low original investment and the gear used is relatively inexpensive compared with netting operations. As a result, this manner of fishing has attracted hundreds of commercial fishermen along the 1, 000 miles of California coast. In recent years, commercial men are being outnumbered by the host of sport fishermen, many of whom do trolling at some time during the year. Sport fishermen pioneered ocean trolling in California and have initiated several of the improvements that have been adopted during the 75 years since ocean trolling started in this State. An account, from time to time, of the gear and methods of operating is desirable for each of our important fisheries. Not only may changes be noted, but gear and methods of fishing have a direct bearing when appraising the <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> per unit <b>of</b> fishing effort in attempts to determine changes in the supply of fish in the ocean. The following descriptions of gear (when not dated) apply to 1955...|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this {{bulletin}} {{is to put}} on <b>record</b> a description <b>of</b> the Monterey sardine[1] fishery {{which can be used}} as a basis for judging future changes in the conduct of this industry. Detailed knowledge of changes is essential to an understanding of the significance <b>of</b> total <b>catch</b> figures, or <b>of</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> per boat or per seine haul. It is particularly necessary when applying any form <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> analysis to a fishery as a means of illustrating the presence or absence of depletion or of natural fluctuations in supply. Most of the detailed descriptions in the following pages are based on conditions as they existed during the two fishing seasons, 1920 – 1921 and 1921 – 1922. However, the many changes, chiefly general developments in the industry, have so profoundly affected the total catch and catch per boat that several revisions of the original account have been required. Dates of revision, in parentheses, accompany the notes of these changes. While this is somewhat awkward, it definitely fixes the year in which certain practices began or were discontinued, and thus aids in fulfilling the chief purpose <b>of</b> the <b>record.</b> These notes include only a description of fishing methods, fishing gear, and some of the business conditions of the industry which directly affect the catch. No attempt is made in them to cover all of the complex economic conditions that may influence the catch...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Svalbard {{archipelago}} in the High Arctic {{is influenced}} by cold Arctic water masses from the north-east and the warm West Spitsbergen Current flowing northwards along its western coast. The eastern waters and the fjords are normally frozen during the winter months, while the coastal waters west of the archipelago remain open. Norwegian fishers have been harvesting from Svalbard waters for decades and detailed <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>catches</b> exists from 1980 onwards. We analyze the catch records from the Svalbard zone (approximately ICES area IIb). The large fishery for capelin in summer yielding annual catches up to 737   000 tons was closed by a Norwegian fishery regulation in the mid nineteen nineties. Demersal fisheries have been continuous, and the results clearly indicate a northward trend in landings of Northeast Arctic cod, haddock, ling and Atlantic halibut. Fisheries of Northern shrimp have been more variable and shown no clear geographic trends. A “gold rush” fishery for scallops north of Svalbard lasted for about 10 years (1986 – 1995) only, and ended due to low profitably. These results are discussed {{in relation to the}} possibility of further northward extension of fisheries subjected to climate change...|$|R
