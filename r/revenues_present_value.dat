40|$|This paper uses {{a dynamic}} {{optimization}} model {{to estimate the}} welfare gains of hedging against commodity price risk for commodity-exporting countries. The introduction of hedging instruments such as futures and options enhances domestic welfare through two channels. First, by reducing export income volatility and allowing for a smoother consumption path. Second, by reducing the country''s need to hold foreign assets as precautionary savings (or by improving the country''s ability to borrow against future export income). Under plausibly calibrated parameters, the second channel may lead to much larger welfare gains, amounting to several percentage points of annual consumption.

30|$|The {{effect of}} various {{parameters}} on plant economics {{has been observed}} {{in this study and}} the following conclusions have been achieved. In case of plant life ranging from 5 to 35  years, the fuel cost is observed to be highly sensitive, while pumping cost is observed to be least sensitive. It is also concluded that payback (or gestation period) of the plant is nearly 10  years. Increase in interest rate decreases the value of various plant costs. The total operating cost, <b>revenue</b> earned, net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> of plant, costs of fuel, maintenance, insurance, labour and pumping with escalation rates have been observed to be higher than the case without escalation. Since labour cost influences the operating cost at a slow rate, the variation in all trends of operating cost, <b>revenue</b> and net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> is marginal. In case of plant (see Fig. 17), results predict that plant life, interest rate and the escalation rate observed to be very sensitive on plant economics in comparison to other factors under study.|$|R

5000|$|Proponents of {{the estate}} tax argue that large inheritances (currently those over $5 million) are a {{progressive}} and fair source of government funding. Removing the estate tax, they argue, favors only the very wealthy and leaves {{a greater share of}} the total tax burden on working taxpayers. Proponents further argue that campaigns to repeal the tax rely on public confusion about the estate tax and about tax policy more generally. [...] William Gale and Joel Slemrod give three reasons for taxing at the point of inheritance in their book Rethinking Estate and Gift Taxation. [...] "First, the probate process may reveal information about lifetime economic well-being that is difficult to obtain in the course of enforcement of the income tax but is nevertheless relevant to societal notions of who should pay tax. Second, taxes imposed at death may have smaller disincentive effects on lifetime labor supply and saving than taxes that raise the same <b>revenue</b> (in <b>present</b> <b>value</b> terms) but are imposed during life.

The effect of escalation rates on pumping and labour cost has not been considered in the present work. In Fig.  13, the effect on accumulated operating cost components such as fuel, maintenance, insurance cost, labour and pumping cost, with and without escalation rates has been plotted at 210  MW plant load. Fuel cost, maintenance, insurance, labour and pumping cost with escalation rates has been observed to be 4050.8, 747.68, 207.68, 272.3 and 119.06  INR crores, respectively. On the other hand, these costs without escalation rates were observed to be 1892.8, 311.52, 207.68, 272.3 and 119.06  INR crores, respectively.

40|$|Research PaperA bioeconomic {{model of}} the Oregon ocean shrimp (Pandalus jordani) fishery was {{developed}} to evaluate management policy options for maximizing fishery yield, <b>revenue,</b> and/or net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> using existing regulatory policy approaches. The base model accounts for a multiple cohort seasonal fishery, a count per pound catch composition, and an ex-vessel price relationship. The model chooses the fishing strategy by identifying the timing and intensity of fleet effort {{as the number of}} trips per month. Results of the base model indicate that optimizing yield requires early season harvest of age 1 recruits, whereas revenue and profit optimization suggest a delay in the season opening date. Two variations of the base model are presented: 1) heterogeneous vessel related opportunity costs, and 2) the integration of processing and harvesting sectors.

30|$|Profitable capital {{investment}} {{leads to the}} growth and prosperity of an economy. If profitability is low, investment will shrink. These economic indices provide a basis to evaluate the net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> index {{for the analysis of}} process industries. However, there is considerable scope for a coal-fired electric power generation facility to be cost-effective. The objective of the present work is to achieve profitable {{capital investment}} in a 210  MW coal-fired thermal power plant situated in north India. Thus, a balanced integration of the cost analysis module of coal-fired power plant and economics needs to be carried out, so that the power plant economic indices of coal-fired power plant in terms of total capital investment, operating cost (i.e. fuel cost, operations and maintenance cost), <b>revenue</b> and net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> could be analysed. The basis of most design decisions is economic; thus, economical consideration plays a significant role as the economics of coal-fired power plant is closely associated with technical aspects. Various methods have been developed for controlling the economics of thermal power plant, namely annual cost method, capitalized cost method and present worth method. Peters et al. (1991) proposed that to account for the cost of the investment, the total capital cost must be placed on an annual basis (i.e. due to interest accumulated on the investment, depreciation, maintenance, insurance and taxes). There is always deterioration of equipment life and thus its depreciation cost loses value.|$|R

Sierra Leone has had almost continuous involvement with IMF programs since 1994 under {{a variety of}} arrangements. All the IMF-supported programs in Sierra Leone during 1994 – 2004 had the same overarching aim of raising long-term growth and reducing poverty. Their near-term objectives, however, varied with existing circumstances. Each of the programs emphasized disciplined macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. Performance relative to program objectives improved over time and was the strongest under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility.

40|$|The {{sustainable}} {{provision of}} bio-methane {{plays a key}} role in the future energy supply and is a promising environmentally friendly solution for waste processing. With rising number and size of biogas power plants process optimization is a vital task. Consequently, in this thesis a 6000 [L/d] swine waste feed into anaerobic digestion reactor will be degraded into biogas, which thesis aim is to optimize process with numerical models and programming skills to run multiple input variables in order to solve optimization problem. Objective functions for optimization are economic <b>revenue</b> and net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> of process with optimization variables of reactor volume and temperature. Mathematical model for process is (Hill, 1983) method, which is a dynamic simulation model for anaerobic fermentation of biodegradable material. Also more mathematical model for temperature and volume has been made with physical rules such as energy balance and mass transfer. Economic analyses starts with cost estimation for equipment based on pilot reactor and market prices, and then time value of money has been included in calculation. The results contain measurement of payback ability for anaerobic digestion process in various financial criteria (such as internal rate of return); furthermore thesis results indicates an applicability of numerical algorithms in economic optimization performance in anaerobic digestion process where outcome of thesis could be a measurement standard for profitability of different process designs. Finally it is concluded that estimations for process equipment are playing a vital rule in economic performance; therefore cost estimation must be based on more precise data sources. General revenue and internal rate of return shows clear financial feasibility of process and optimization shows sensible added profits in cash flow diagrams...|$|R
