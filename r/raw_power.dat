5|$|The Scala at No.275–277 Pentonville Road opened as the King's Cross Cinema in 1920 with a {{capacity}} of 1,300. Construction had begun just before World War I and was halted because of it. It was damaged by bombs during World War II, and while it remained open during wartime, it eventually had to be shut between 1949 and 1952 for renovations and repair. It closed in 1970, and re-opened as an independent cinema, which showed old 16mm films including King Kong. The Stooges played their only gig in London at the venue in June 1972, shortly before recording the album <b>Raw</b> <b>Power</b> with David Bowie; a shot of Iggy Pop onstage here became the album's front cover. The venue closed in 1992, {{and is now a}} nightclub.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{study the}} {{complexity}} of the following problem: Given two weighted voting games G′ and G″ that each contain a player p, in which of these games is p’s power index value higher? We study this problem with respect to both the Shapley–Shubik power index and the Banzhaf power index. Our main result is that for both of these power indices the problem is complete for probabilistic polynomial time (i. e., is PP-complete). We apply our results to partially resolve some recently proposed problems regarding {{the complexity of}} weighted voting games. We also study {{the complexity of the}} <b>raw</b> Shapley–Shubik <b>power</b> index. Deng and Papadimitriou showed that the <b>raw</b> Shapley–Shubik <b>power</b> index is #P-metric-complete. We strengthen this by showing that the <b>raw</b> Shapley–Shubik <b>power</b> index is many–one complete for #P. And our strengthening cannot possibly be further improved to parsimonious completeness, since we observe that, in contrast with the <b>raw</b> Banzhaf <b>power</b> index, the <b>raw</b> Shapley–Shubik <b>power</b> index is not #P-parsimonious-complete...|$|R

25|$|At the time, {{the album}} (which showcased Williamson's {{intensely}} melodic solos and chromatic riffs, {{in contrast to}} Asheton's minimalistic, groove-oriented approach) was criticized by diehard fans who said that Bowie had mixed it poorly (in subsequent years, various unofficial fan recordings were assembled and released as the album Rough Power; in 1997, the album was re-mixed by Iggy Pop and re-released). Although the album sold rather poorly and {{was regarded as a}} commercial failure {{at the time of its}} release, <b>Raw</b> <b>Power</b> would go on to become one of the cornerstones of early punk rock.|$|E

In 2005, Nick found an old reel to reel tape of a long lost Machines 'live demo' session from 1977, containing two songs: ‘Racing’ and ‘You Better Hear’. Dizzy of Detour / Bin Line Records wanted to release the tracks on a forthcoming edition of his punk rarities series, Bored Teenagers.|$|E

25|$|With the {{addition}} of a piano player (briefly Bob Sheff and then Scott Thurston), the Stooges toured for several months, starting in February 1973. About this time they also made a number of recordings that became known as the Detroit Rehearsal Tapes, including a number of new songs that might have been included on a fourth studio album had the band not been dropped by Columbia soon after the release of <b>Raw</b> <b>Power.</b> In 1973, James Williamson was briefly dismissed due to criticism from the band's management company (likely pertaining to his tempestuous relationship with Cyrinda Foxe, a close friend of road manager Leee Black Childers); guitarist Tornado Turner replaced him for a single gig (on 15 June 1973 at the Aragon Ballroom, Chicago, Illinois), but Williamson soon returned to the group.|$|E

Bridgeport, Connecticut's WPKN had {{a radio show}} featuring hardcore called Capital Radio, hosted by Brad Morrison, beginning in February 1979 and continuing weekly until late 1983. In New York City, Tim Sommer hosted Noise The Show on WNYU. In 1982, Bob Sallese produced The Big Apple Rotten To The Core compilation on S.I.N. Records, featuring The Mob, Ism and four other bands from the early A7 era. The album gained notoriety on the commercial radio station WLIR, and nationally on college radio.

25|$|In 1971, {{without a}} record deal, the Stooges kept {{performing}} in small clubs with a 5-piece line-up that included both Ron Asheton and James Williamson on guitars and Jimmy Recca on bass, Dave Alexander having been sacked by Pop {{the previous year}} when he turned up for a gig unable to play because of his chronic alcoholism (he died in 1975). That year Pop and David Bowie met at Max's Kansas City, a nightclub and restaurant in New York City. Pop's career received a boost from his relationship with Bowie when Bowie decided in 1972 to produce an album with Pop in England. With James Williamson signed on as guitarist, the search began for a rhythm section. However, since neither Pop nor Williamson were satisfied with any players in England, they decided to re-unite the Stooges. Ron Asheton grudgingly moved from guitar to bass. The recording sessions produced the rock landmark <b>Raw</b> <b>Power.</b> After its release Scott Thurston {{was added to the}} band on keyboards/electric piano and Bowie continued his support, but Pop's drug problem persisted. The Stooges' last show in 1974 ended in a fight between the band and a group of bikers, documented on the album Metallic K.O. Drug abuse stalled his career again for several years.|$|E
25|$|After Morgoth's defeat, his {{lieutenant}} Sauron gradually rallied many of Morgoth's {{servants to}} his own cause, and during the Second Age established himself {{in the land of}} Mordor. Sauron lacked the <b>raw</b> <b>power</b> and malice of his master, but he seduced many to his allegiance with lies and false promises. In the Second Age, Sauron repeatedly used his fame among Men as Morgoth's erstwhile lieutenant to portray himself as Morgoth's representative and thus gain the allegiance of his former master's worshippers. Similarly, in Númenor following his capture, Sauron became very powerful by seducing Ar-Pharazôn to the worship of Melkor, establishing a Cult in which it was only natural that, as Melkor's foremost former disciple, he became high priest. This cult exploited the Númenórean fear of death by claiming that human sacrifice to Melkor would grant the Men of Númenor immortality. In actuality, by turning away from Eru and the Valar they only dwindled more rapidly. Sauron used this religion among his means of encouraging Ar-Pharazôn's invasion of Valinor, which resulted in the destruction of Númenor by Eru. By the Third Age Sauron came more often to propound himself, rather than Morgoth, as the object of worship for his servants and subjects, but in his pride also portrayed himself as Morgoth returned when it was more convenient for him to do so.|$|E
25|$|Marciano is {{commonly}} {{remembered as a}} swarmer due to his use of constant pressure in the ring, but {{he has also been}} called a slugger and a brawler; he was essentially all three. A late starter in the sport with little training and a short amateur career, he lacked the skills and finesse of most heavyweight champions, but he made up for it in brute force and <b>raw</b> <b>power.</b> Early in his career, he was notorious for his punching power, holding 11 first-round knockouts to his name. As the opposition got better, Marciano relied on his incredible stamina, relentlessness, and ability to fight rough and swarm on the inside to get him through fights just as much as the power. He sometimes went entire fights being pummeled by opponents such as Jersey Joe Walcott, Ezzard Charles, and Archie Moore, but came on strong as his opponent faded. He was also noted for hitting his opposition on their arms while they were blocking. Although this did not score points, over the rounds, it made their arms numb and essentially useless. Rocky faced criticism over his career for poor foot movement and for taking too many shots: he used weaving, but was often caught coming in. This, however, did not matter because he was able to take the shots. He is now known for having one of the best chins in boxing history, being knocked down just twice in his entire career, both times more to do with poor balancing rather than being dazed.|$|E
