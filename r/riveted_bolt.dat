30|$|Connections {{designed}} more conservatively than members {{because they}} are more complex to analyze, and discrepancy between analysis and design is large. Connections account for more than half the cost of structural steel work. Connection design has influence over member design. Similar to members, connections are also classified as idealized types effected through <b>rivets,</b> <b>bolts</b> or weld. Connections are normally made either by bolting or welding. Bolting is common in field connections, since it is simple and economical to make. Bolting is also regarded as being more appropriate in field connections from considerations of safety.|$|R

40|$|Composite spar-shell {{fan blades}} for a 1. 83 meter (6 feet) {{diameter}} fan stage were fabricated and {{tested in a}} whirling arm facility to evaluate foreign object damage (FOD) resistance. The blades were made by adhesively bonding boron-epoxy shells on titanium spars and then adhesively bonding an Inconel 625 sheath on the leading edge. The rotating blades were individually tested at a tip speed of 800 feet per second. Impacting media used were gravel, <b>rivets,</b> <b>bolt,</b> nut, ice balls, simulated birds, and a real bird. Incidence angles were typical of those which might be experienced by STOL aircraft. The tests showed that blades of the design tested in this program have satisfactory impact resistance to small objects such as gravel, <b>rivets,</b> nuts, <b>bolts,</b> and two inch diameter ice balls. The blades suffered nominal damage when impacted with one-pound birds (9 to 10 ounce slice size). However, the shell {{was removed from the}} spar for a larger slice size...|$|R

The result was pollution which began to affect Mayfield which lost its fashionable status. The housing erected during and after World War I was overwhelmingly for those with employment in the heavy industries.

50|$|A {{disadvantage}} {{of the wet}} wing is that every <b>rivet,</b> <b>bolt,</b> nut plate, hose and tube that penetrates the wing must be sealed to prevent fuel from leaking or seeping around these hardware components. This sealant must allow for expansion and contraction due to rapid temperature changes (such as when cold fuel is pumped into a warm wing tank) and must retain its sealing properties when submerged in fuel and when left dry {{for long periods of}} time. Working with this sealant can be difficult and replacing old sealant inside a small wing tank can be harder if the old sealant needs to be removed as well before new sealant can be applied.|$|R

40|$|All {{assembly}} situations include joining {{of parts}} – by welding, <b>riveting,</b> <b>bolting</b> or using clip fasteners etc. Normally, the force needed to join two parts, i. e. the assembly force, is calculated under nominal conditions. Since all manufactured parts, {{as well as}} assembly fixtures, are afflicted with variation, the gap between two flanges {{that are to be}} joined may vary. Therefore, also the force needed to close the gap will vary as well as the remaining holding force. For a fixed force produced by a welding gun or an operator, also the remaining force after closing the gap will vary, which may lead to quality problems. In this paper, a simulation method for prediction of required assembly forces as well as holding forces due to initial gap is presented. Three different joining techniques are also discussed with respect to assembly and joining forces...|$|R

40|$|Carbon fibre {{composites}} are a {{key component}} of aircraft structures because of their enhanced material properties such as favourable strength to weight ratios when compared to metal alloys. During the assembly process of an aircraft, carbon fibre components are joined to other structures using <b>rivets,</b> <b>bolts,</b> and fasteners, and as part of the joining process, the components will need to be machined or drilled. Unlike metal alloys, composites are sensitive to heat and are vulnerable to internal structural damage from machining tools. They are also susceptible to a reduction in strength when fibres are exposed to moisture. In the machining process, carbon fibre composites may be drilled using oils to lubricate carbide machining tools. In this study, a description of the experimental apparatus is provided along with an investigation to determine the influence synthetic biodegradable lubricating oil has on drill rotational speed, drilling load, and drilling temperature when using a pneumatic drill to machine carbon fibre composite material...|$|R
40|$|Silicon carbide fibres {{silicon carbide}} matrix (SiC/SiC) {{composites}} {{are among the}} most promising materials for high temperature applications, but they cannot be joined by traditional ways because they do not melt and the typical mechanical joints (<b>rivets,</b> <b>bolts,</b> etc.) are ineffective with these new materials: this is a problem for the preparation of complex structures, such as those of plasma-facing components (PFCs) for fusion reactors. Furthermore, these composites show a poor resistance towards the oxidation, they are porous and permeable to fluids. PFCs made of composite materials and in which joints and coatings are made with advanced materials pose some new problems regarding their safety. In particular, the following aspects have been addressed in this paper: (a) tritium inventory; (b) activated dust in plasma chamber; (c) accident-relevant low-activation properties; and (d) long-term relevant low-activation properties. As a result of all the above mentioned aspects, some safety-relevant guidelines for the choice of joining and coating materials for PFCs are finally discussed...|$|R
60|$|As {{this part}} of Lake Champlain is narrow, a {{connection}} was kept up between the two forts by a floating bridge, supported on twenty-two sunken piers in caissons, formed of very strong timber.

40|$|Light weight {{structures}} commonly {{have low}} connate structural damping. The damping mechanism of various jointed structures {{can be explained}} by considering the energy loss due to friction and the dynamic slip produced at the interfaces. The frictional damping is evaluated from the relative slip between the jointed interfaces and is considered to be the most useful method for inspect the structural damping. The damping characteristics in jointed structures are influenced by the intensity of pressure distribution, micro-slip kinematic coefficient of friction and logarithmic decrement at the interfaces. The effects of all these parameters on the mechanism of damping have been extensively studied. All the above basic parameters are largely influenced by the thickness ratio of the beam and thereby affect the damping capacity of the structures. In addition to this, beam length of the structures and diameter of connecting <b>rivet</b> and <b>bolt</b> also play key roles on the damping capacity of the jointed structures is assessable. For <b>rivet</b> <b>bolt</b> & welded joints the theoretical analysis proposes two different methods to calculate damping: classical method and finite element method. The analyses are based on the assumptions of Euler-Bernoulli beam theory as the dimensions of test specimens satisfy the criterion of thin beam theory. The effects of all these parameters are studied distinctly in the present investigation. It is established that the damping capacity can be increased appreciably using larger beam length and their diameters as well as lower thickness ratio of the beams. This design concept of using these structures can be effectively utilized in trusses and frames, aircraft and aerospace structures, bridges, machine members, robots and many other applications where higher damping is required. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on a number of mild steel specimens under different initial conditions of excitation for establishing the accuracy of the theory developed. Finally damping on various joint structures has been compared...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. An {{educational}} software called Eccentric loading is introduced. Eccentric loading, is a user-friendly and yet {{powerful tool for}} the analysis and design of <b>riveted</b> and <b>bolted</b> joints that are subjected to eccentric loads. The user starts the application by specifying his case as compound shear if the load is in {{the plane of the}} fasteners, eccentric loading if the applied load is not in the plane of the <b>rivet</b> or <b>bolts,</b> and general loading if the loading is of amore general type. In all three cases, the user is prompted to select his objective either as Determining the factor of safety, or to find the diameter of the fastener. Fulfilling some of the objectives, further requires the description of the Geometry of the joint, and the specification of the materials, unless the use of the default material is acceptable. Invoking next, the Solve command, which is equivalent to invoking the OK button, the software carries out a series of tedious computations, after which, it presents a comprehensive Report comprising a summary of stresses, joint efficiency and factors of safety, and a detailed summary of the joint geometry and. properties. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{interest of the}} industry (especially automotive, aviation and marine) in the fastener joints (<b>riveted,</b> <b>bolted,</b> etc.) between metallic materials, has re-opened the study on the possibility to improve {{the performance of the}} drilled structure using plastic deformation processes. Indentation process, performed before the drilling operation, creates circumferential compression stresses around the hole which increase significantly the mechanical performance of the drilled structures. In this paper, static and the fatigue performances of aluminum–aluminum (AW 6082 -T 6) single-lap bolted joints are studied. In particular, the study compares the mechanical strength of only drilled single-lap bolted joints (OD specimens) and single-lap bolted joints subject to an indentation process (IP specimens). In order to determine the cycles to failure and the corresponding Wöhler diagram, several fatigue tests are performed. The analyses allow to determine the mechanical performance and the failure mode of the analyzed joints. Several numerical analysis, conducted in ANSYS environment on three-dimensional models of the single-lap joint, are focused on the evaluation of the residual stress on the indented plate and, in particular, to compare the stress distribution on both type of analyzed joints...|$|R

50|$|A final {{trend in}} the between-the-wars period was changes in {{manufacturing}} methods. France pioneered the use of very large castings to form gun mantlets, turrets and eventually, with the S-35, entire tank hulls. The widespread use of casting was copied by the US and USSR, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the UK. Casting enables the fast manufacture of ballistically well-shaped components. Germany never made much use of large cast components, limiting casting to smaller items such as mantlets. Welding gradually replaced <b>riveting</b> and <b>bolting</b> as a means of fastening rolled armor plate together. Rivets can shear off when struck by enemy fire, resulting in additional crew casualties. Germany and the USSR led the way with welding, although the US followed closely. <b>Riveting</b> and <b>bolting</b> remained in use in some countries such as Hungary, Japan, and Italy, {{and to a lesser extent}} in the United Kingdom right to the end of World War II. Finally, the US and USSR led the way in rationalizing designs for fast production, eliminating unnecessary components or manufacturing steps that added little value. In contrast, French and German pre-war (and even wartime) tanks often incorporated features that added cost or manufacturing complexity out of proportion to their combat value.|$|R
