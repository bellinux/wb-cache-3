40|$|In {{this work}} we study {{dynamics}} of fermionic quantum gases. <b>Radio</b> frequency <b>spectroscopy,</b> Josephson oscillations, and time-of-flight dynamics are studied theoretically, {{and with the}} help of numerical simulations using the time-evolving block decimation algorithm. The simulations of <b>radio</b> frequency <b>spectroscopy</b> shed light on the nature of excitations in a fermionic superfluid confined in a lattice. The Josephson oscillations in the presence of different potentials for up and down spins show that the asymmetric Josephson effect cannot be described by the traditionally established view of coherent tunnelling of Cooper pairs. The expansion dynamics of a band-insulating state reveals that we can explain the time development of two-component systems in a lattice using a simple two-site model. Finally, the time-of-flight expansion of an imbalanced superfluid restricted to move in one dimension provides a remarkably simple way for detecting the long-sought-for Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superfluid state...|$|R

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{dynamics}} of a resonant Bose gas following its quench to a strongly interacting regime near a Feshbach resonance. For such deep quenches, we utilize a self-consistent dynamic field approximation and find that after an initial regime of many-body Rabi-like oscillations between the condensate and finite-momentum quasiparticle pairs, at long times, the gas reaches a pre-thermalized nonequilibrium steady state. We explore the resulting state through its broad stationary momentum distribution function, that exhibits a power-law high momentum tail. We study the dynamics and steady-state form of the associated enhanced depletion, quench-rate dependent excitation energy, Tan's contact, structure function and <b>radio</b> frequency <b>spectroscopy.</b> We find these predictions {{to be in a}} qualitative agreement with recent experiments.

30|$|As {{the needs}} for {{spectroscopy}} have increased, spectroscopy techniques and spectrometers have been improved. <b>Radio</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> has enabled a filter bank technique that employs {{an array of}} analog band-pass filters.

Frequency-sweep or frequency-agile-type spectrum analyzers, in which the frequency of the local oscillator is swept or changed sequentially, have also been commonly used, while usually the sensitivities of their spectra are limited because the accumulation time of each frequency channel is much shorter than the sweep time. Acousto-optical spectrometers (AOS), which utilize diffraction of light, have been used mainly for heterodyne observations in the high-frequency range.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of aerosil particles with human erythrocytes was investigated by electron microscopy methods complemented with hemolysis and <b>radio</b> wave dielectric <b>spectroscopy</b> to elucidate {{the extent of}} morphological and functional modification induced by aerosil surface. Scanning electron microscopy and freeze-fracturing techniques were used to follow morphological and ultrastructural modifications and hemolysis tests and <b>radio</b> wave dielectric <b>spectroscopy</b> to monitor the membrane damage. All experimental results indicate {{that there is an}} effect depending on both silica concentration and incubation time. Our results are in good agreement with an interaction model based on membrane protein denaturation due to the electrostatic attraction between (-SiO-) groups at the silica surface and proteins embedded in the membrane, The process is time-limited and reaches saturation after about 20 min. The extent of the damage is determined mainly by the ratio between cell and aerosil surface, that is, aerosil concentration. Limited damage is observed, especially when little aerosil surface per cell is available. Conversely, strong membrane damage is obtained when aerosil surface is considerable. In any case, due to the high surface/volume of aerosil particles used in our experiments we obtained considerable membrane damage with small weight concentrations. (C) 1999 Academic Press...|$|R
