In agreement with previous studies, we found accumulations of acetaldehyde in rice during <b>re-aeration</b> following submergence. During <b>re-aeration,</b> acetaldehyde-oxidizing aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity increased, thereby causing the acetaldehyde content to decrease in rice. Interestingly, re-aerated rice plants showed an intense mitochondrial ALDH 2 a protein induction, even though ALDH 2 a mRNA was submergence induced and declined upon <b>re-aeration.</b> This suggests that rice ALDH 2 a mRNA is accumulated in order to quickly metabolize acetaldehyde that is produced upon <b>re-aeration...</b>|$|E

Although higher total levels of ascorbate and glutathione were observed under hypoxia, only {{the total amount of}} ascorbate was increased under anoxia. Under both treatments {{a significant increase in the}} reduced form of ascorbate and glutathione was found, resulting in increased reduction states. Upon the onset of <b>re-aeration</b> the ratios started to decline rapidly, indicating oxidative stress. Hypoxia caused higher activity of ascorbate peroxidase, whereas activities of monodehydroascorbate reductase, dehydroascorbate reductase, and glutathione reductase were diminished or only slightly influenced. Under anoxia, activities of ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase decreased significantly to 39 and 62 %, respectively. However, after <b>re-aeration</b> of hypoxically or anoxically pretreated roots, activity of enzymes approached the control levels. This corresponds with the restoration of the high reduction state of ascorbate and glutathione within 16 to 96 h of <b>re-aeration,</b> depending on the previous duration of anoxia.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} (3 -D) physical–biogeochemical coupled {{model was}} applied to explore the mechanisms controlling the dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics and bottom hypoxia during summer in the Pearl River estuary (PRE). By using the numerical oxygen tracers, we proposed a new method (namely the physical modulation method) to quantify the contributions of boundary conditions and each source and sink process occurring in local and adjacent waters to the DO conditions. A mass balance analysis of DO based on the physical modulation method indicated that the DO conditions at the bottom layer were mainly controlled by the source and sink processes, among which the sediment oxygen demand (SOD) at the water–sediment interface and the <b>re-aeration</b> at the air–sea interface were the two primary processes determining the spatial extent and duration of bottom hypoxia in the PRE. The SOD could cause {{a significant decrease in}} the bottom DO concentrations (averaged over July–August  2006) by over 4  mg L − 1 on the shelf off the Modaomen sub-estuary, leading to the formation of a high-frequency zone of hypoxia (HFZ). However, the hypoxia that occurred in the HFZ was intermittent and distributed in a small area due to the combined effects of <b>re-aeration</b> and photosynthesis, which behaved as sources for DO and offset a portion of the DO consumed by SOD. The bottom DO concentrations {{to the west of the}} lower Lingdingyang Bay (i. e. the western shoal near Qi'ao Island) were also largely affected by high SOD, but there was no hypoxia occurring there because of the influence of <b>re-aeration.</b> Specifically, <b>re-aeration</b> could lead to an increase in the bottom DO concentrations by ∼[*] 4. 8  mg L − 1 to the west of the lower Lingdingyang Bay.

River regulation may have increased the frequency and severity of hypoxic blackwater events in lowland river systems, necessitating management intervention to mitigate the impacts of these events on aquatic biota. We examine {{the effectiveness of a}} range of mitigation interventions that have been used during large-scale hypoxic blackwater events in the Murray–Darling Basin, Australia and that may be applicable in other environments at risk from hypoxic blackwater. Strategies for hypoxia mitigation include: delivery of dilution flows; enhancement of physical <b>re-aeration</b> rates by increasing surface turbulence; and diversion of blackwater into shallow off-channel storages. We show that the impact of dilution water delivery is determined by relative volumes and water quality and can be predicted using simple models. At the dilution water inflow point, localized oxygenated plumes may also act as refuges. Physical <b>re-aeration</b> strategies generally result in only a small increase in dissolved oxygen but may be beneficial for local refuge protection. Dilution and natural <b>re-aeration</b> processes in large, shallow lake systems can be sufficient to compensate for hypoxic inflows and water processed in off-channel lakes may be able to be returned to the river channel as dilution flows.

Submergence also altered the PSII activity, as reflected in a decrease in the values of Fo, Fm and Fv/Fm and degradation of chlorophyll, more in Swarna than in Swarna-Sub 1. During early submergence period, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), glutathione reductase (GR) against reactive oxygen species were increased in the both varieties.

40|$|With the re-evaluation and {{revision}} {{of a number}} of design floods, several embankment overtopping protection systems have been developed and a common technique is the construction of a stepped spillway on the downstream slope. For such moderate slope stepped channels, detailed air–water flowmeasurements were performed in a large facility with a focus on the rate of energy dissipation, flow resistance, air–water interfacial areas and <b>re-aeration</b> rates. Past and present experimental results showed a significant aeration of the flow. The median dimensionless residual head was about 3 ×dc for the 21. 8 ◦ sloping chute and smaller than that for flatter slopes (θ = 3. 4 and 15. 9 degrees). The flow resistance results yielded an equivalent Darcy friction factor of about 0. 25 implying a larger flow resistance for the 21. 8 degree slope angle than for smaller slope angles. The <b>re-aeration</b> rate was deduced from the integration of the mass transfer equation using measured air–water interfacial areas and air–water flow velocities. The results suggested an increasing <b>re-aeration</b> rate with increasing rate of energy dissipation. The stepped invert contributed to intense turbulence production, free-surface aeration and large interfacial areas. The experimental data showed however some distinctive seesaw pattern in the longitudinal distribution of air–water flow properties with a wave length of about two step cavities. While these may be caused by the interactions between successive adjacent step cavities and their interference with the free-surface, the existence of such "instabilities" implies that the traditional concept of normal flow might not exist in skimming flows above moderate-slope stepped spillways...|$|E

30|$|As third step, the PEEP {{trial is}} {{performed}} monitoring respiratory mechanics as reference. For patients with focal loss of aeration, {{low levels of}} PEEP (≤[*] 10  cmH 2 O) can be tested, under BUS monitoring to promptly detect cerebral hemodynamics disturbances (higher levels of PEEP rarely result in recruitment of consolidations in these patients, and expose normally aerated lung zones to over-distension, with no benefit on gas exchanges at the useless price of increasing ICP). For patients with diffuse loss of aeration (diffuse ARDS), higher levels of PEEP (from 12  cmH 2 O up) can be tested, still under BUS monitoring. At each increase of PEEP, responsiveness can be monitored by LUS examination of anterior zones [40]; PEEP is increased by 2 – 4  cmH 2 O until anterior zones with moderate or severe aeration loss (respectively separated and coalescent B-lines) become normal (A-lines). Increasing PEEP further to obtain a complete disappearance of B-lines (in lateral zones) or consolidation (in posterior zones) theoretically exposes previously recruited anterior lung zones to over-distension. A semi-quantitative <b>re-aeration</b> score can also be applied in a more exhaustive approach: each intercostal space is examined {{within each of the}} 12 regions in both hemi-thoraxes [17]. To apply this scoring method, the most pathological pattern in each region is considered as characterizing the pattern of the entire region.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: There is an {{increasing}} interest in biphasic positive airway pressure with spontaneous breathing (BIPAP+SBmean), which {{is a combination of}} time-cycled controlled breaths at two levels of continuous positive airway pressure (BIPAP+SBcontrolled) and non-assisted spontaneous breathing (BIPAP+SBspont), in the early phase of acute lung injury (ALI). However, pressure support ventilation (PSV) remains the most commonly used mode of assisted ventilation. To date, the effects of BIPAP+SBmean and PSV on regional lung aeration and ventilation during ALI are only poorly defined. METHODS: In 10 anesthetized juvenile pigs, ALI was induced by surfactant depletion. BIPAP+SBmean and PSV were performed in a random sequence (1 h each) at comparable mean airway pressures and minute volumes. Gas exchange, hemodynamics, and inspiratory effort were determined and dynamic computed tomography scans obtained. Aeration and ventilation were calculated in four zones along the ventral-dorsal axis at lung apex, hilum and base. RESULTS: Compared to PSV, BIPAP+SBmean resulted in: 1) lower mean tidal volume, comparable oxygenation and hemodynamics, and increased PaCO 2 and inspiratory effort; 2) less nonaerated areas at end-expiration; 3) decreased tidal hyperaeration and re-aeration; 4) similar distributions of ventilation. During BIPAP+SBmean: i) BIPAP+SBspont had lower tidal volumes and higher rates than BIPAP+SBcontrolled; ii) BIPAP+SBspont and BIPAP+SBcontrolled had similar distributions of ventilation and aeration; iii) BIPAP+SBcontrolled resulted in increased tidal <b>re-aeration</b> and hyperareation, compared to PSV. BIPAP+SBspont showed an opposite pattern. CONCLUSIONS: In this model of ALI, the reduction of tidal <b>re-aeration</b> and hyperaeration during BIPAP+SBmean compared to PSV is not due to decreased nonaerated areas at end-expiration or different distribution of ventilation, but to lower tidal volumes during BIPAP+SBspont. The ratio between spontaneous to controlled breaths seems to play a pivotal role in reducing tidal <b>re-aeration</b> and hyperaeration during BIPAP+SBmean...|$|E

Hypoxia influenced solute transport within minutes of exposure as indicated by increases in root pressure (Pr) and decreases in turgor pressure (Pc), but these effects were only significant in lupins. <b>Re-aeration</b> returned Pr to original levels in yellow lupin, but in narrow-leafed lupin, Pr declined to zero or lower values without recovery even when re-aerated. Hypoxia inhibited hydraulic conductivity of root cortical cells (Lpc) in all three species, but only inhibited hydraulic conductivity of roots (Lpr) in wheat, indicating different pathways for radial water flow across lupin and wheat roots.

Energy‐related parameters measured were fermentation end‐products (ethanol, lactate, alanine), respiratory rate, ATP, adenylate energy charge, nitrate reductase activity and biomass. ATP synthesis rates were calculated from the first four parameters. Reactive oxygen species were estimated from H 2 O 2 and superoxide levels, and the enzymatic detoxification potential from the activity levels of catalase and superoxide dismutase. Structure‐related parameters were total fatty acids, free fatty acids (FFAs), lipid hydroperoxides, total phospholipids, N‐acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) and cell viability. The following issues are addressed in this review: (1) what is the impact of anoxia on membrane lipids and how does this relate to energy status; (2) does O 2 per se play a role in these changes; (3) under which conditions and to what extent does lipid peroxidation occur upon re‐aeration; and (4) can the effects of <b>re‐aeration</b> be distinguished from those of anoxia?

40|$|SUMMARY Responses of {{isolated}} adult rat heart cells to conditions that emphasize {{various aspects of}} ischemia have been evaluated. Cells maintained in hypoxic media with limited gubstrate deteriorate mort rapidly than aerobic controls supplemented with glucose. Two distinct irreversible pathways for cell alteration can be distinguished as follows: (1) continued anaerobic aging {{in the absence of}} glucose results in the production of large numbers of cells which retain the rod-shaped morphology of heart cells in situ, but which have lost saxcolemmal integrity, and (2) after a period of anaerobic aging, <b>re-aeration</b> of the cells produces large numbers of rounded cells in irreversible contracture. These cells maintain an intact sarcolemma and are indistinguishable from those produced by addition of 1 mM Ca 1 + to Na+-loaded, aerobic cells. Contracture {{of isolated}} cells on <b>re-aeration</b> is at least superficially analogous to the oxygen paradox in situ, but since the isolated cells maintain an intact sarcolemma, there is no loss of creatine phosphokinase or other components of the cytosol.

Moreover, this study gives a general expression for estimating the air inception length. The turbulence nature and the energy dissipation characteristics of the flows over the macro- and intermediate roughness conditions were also studied...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe CO 2 content, air {{saturation}} and calcite equilibrium of the River Ilm {{and some of}} its tributaries were analysed. CO 2 content was measured by degasing the CO 2 from water. The CO 2 level is a very sensitive indicator for a low pollution in oxygen saturated waters. Clean running waters have a CO 2 content close to the {{air saturation}} of 0. 1 – 0. 3 mg C l− 1. Ground water and springs are rich in CO 2. Polluted waters are characterised by higher CO 2 contents, also organic pollution can result in high values of CO 2. Carbon dioxide concentration of streams and brooks is limited by <b>re-aeration.</b> The headwater region (softwater) of the River Ilm is unsaturated, the hard water in the middle- and underflow is oversaturated. In summer and autumn high saturation could be found, but without autochthonous calcite precipitation like in hard water lakes...|$|E
40|$|Hydraulic jumps {{are highly}} complex three {{dimensional}} flows with strong energy dissipation and air bubble entrainment associated with intense mixing. To date turbulence and air-water flow observations in hydraulic jumps {{have been limited}} to smooth rectangular channels. Herein novel experiments were conducted on a channel with bed macro roughness to characterise the effect of boundary roughness on the air-water flow properties. The results showed distinctive differences including a reduction in hydraulic jump length and upward shift of the roller toe for a rough bed jump. The air-water flow profiles were comparable with larger aeration downstream of the jump toe for the rough bed {{and a reduction in}} aeration and interfacial velocity compared to a smooth bed flow towards the downstream end of the jump. The present study highlighted the potential to use macro roughness boundaries to manipulate the flow performance and the <b>re-aeration</b> capabilities of turbulent hydraulic jumps...|$|E
40|$|Water flow {{controls}} down stream ecosystem {{processes and}} health. The challenge {{here was to}} determine the impacts of flow events on the ecological processes in a creek within an urban (modified) catchment. For two years we studied the health of Moggill Creek, a lowland freshwater creek that flowed through the western suburbs of Brisbane Qld, Australia. Water column dissolved oxygen concentrations and Creek health relied on flow during rain events to physically re-aerate the water to counter the high input of dissolved organic carbon that drove very rapid bacterial consumption of oxygen. A combination of organic load and aeration through storm flow events dictated the health of the system. The project showed the importance of understanding the relationship between the dissolved organic carbon loads, <b>re-aeration</b> rate and water flow in water sensitive urban design to re-create the health of urban streams.

40|$|We {{have taken}} the first steps towards a {{complete}} reconstruction of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis regulatory network based on ChIP-Seq and combined this reconstruction with system-wide profiling of messenger RNAs, proteins, metabolites and lipids during hypoxia and <b>re-aeration.</b> Adaptations to hypoxia {{are thought to have}} a prominent role in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis. Using ChIP-Seq combined with expression data from the induction of the same factors, we have reconstructed a draft regulatory network based on 50 transcription factors. This network model revealed a direct interconnection between the hypoxic response, lipid catabolism, lipid anabolism and the production of cell wall lipids. As a validation of this model, in response to oxygen availability we observe substantial alterations in lipid content and changes in gene expression and metabolites in corresponding metabolic pathways. The regulatory network reveals transcription factors underlying these changes, allows us to computationally predict expression changes, and indicates that Rv 0081 is a regulatory hub...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Spillways or chutes {{have been}} used for over 3000 years. Recently, new {{construction}} materials and design techniques have increased the interest in spillways and chutes to increase dissolved oxygen concentration in water, especially for contaminated city rivers. A series of laboratory experiments were operated to obtain the efficiency of DO mass transfer over roughened spillway. Two kinds of roughened spillway were considered, i. e., stepped and semi-balled spillways. By means of measuring the DO concentration at the crest and downstream of spillways, the experimental results showed that the more the flow rate is, the less the <b>re-aeration</b> ability of roughened spillway is. Compared with the smooth spillway, stepped spillway has the best reoxygenation effect, followed by the spillway whose bottom is pasted some semi-tennis balls, the worst is the smooth spillway. The results highlight that appropriate artificial roughness on the bottom of spillways or chutes may play an important role to increase dissolved oxygen content and improve water quality...|$|E
