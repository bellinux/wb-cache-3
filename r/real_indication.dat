6000|$|... 748. Let us apply these {{principles}} {{to the case}} of ammonia, and the supposed determination of nitrogen to one or the other electrode (554. 555,). A pure strong solution of ammonia is as bad a conductor, and therefore as little liable to electrolyzation, as pure water; but when sulphate of ammonia is dissolved in it, the whole becomes a conductor; nitrogen almost and occasionally quite pure is evolved at the anode, and hydrogen at the cathode; the ratio of the volume of the former to that of the latter varying, but being as 1 to about 3 or 4. This result would seem at first to imply that the electric current had decomposed ammonia, and that the nitrogen had been determined towards the positive electrode. But when the electricity used was measured out by the volta-electrometer (707. 736.), {{it was found that the}} hydrogen obtained was exactly in the proportion which would have been supplied by decomposed water, whilst the nitrogen had no certain or constant relation whatever. When, upon multiplying experiments, it was found that, by using a stronger or weaker solution, or a more or less powerful battery, the gas evolved at the anode was a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, varying both in proportion and absolute quantity, whilst the hydrogen at the cathode remained constant, no doubt could be entertained that the nitrogen at the anode was a secondary result, depending upon the chemical action of the nascent oxygen, determined to that surface by the electric current, upon the ammonia in solution. It was the water, therefore, which was electrolyzed, not the ammonia. Further, the experiment gives no <b>real</b> <b>indication</b> of the tendency of the element nitrogen to either one electrode or the other; nor do I know of any experiment with nitric acid, or other compounds of nitrogen, which shows the tendency of this element, under the influence of the electric current, to pass in either direction along its course.|$|E

On this purpose a survey of present situation in different medical setting was conducted. 200 questionnaires were filled by about 1000 physicians operating in various medical centers.

The number of beds reported by each centers ranged from 0 to 90, while the average doctor-patient ratio was 3. 6. 72 % he centers could avail of B-mode echography (22 % of them owned an echo-Doppler velocimeter).

40|$|Episiotomy is {{a widely}} used {{surgical}} procedure, introduced in the medical practice with no support of its benefit from scientific evidence.

Material and Methods: The electronic data for PubMed and Google Scholar have been searched, according to the vocabulary: legionellosis, epidemiology, outbreak, diagnosis, pathogenesis, therapy, TNF-α inhibitors, indications, side effects, risk of infection. The obtained studies have been selected in English, according to the relevance by the topic. Results: Selected papers, consisted of ten studies and eight case reports, yielded 35 cases of Legionnaires' disease {{associated with the use}} of TNF- α inhibitor treatment. Discussion: There is a prevailing conclusion for increased risk of serious infections while using TNF-α inhibitors and also a deficiency of studies for an association of Legionnaires’ disease with the use of TNF-α inhibitors. Sub-diagnosing and no-existence of screening before the anti-TNF-α therapy blur the factual profile for the researched relation. The possibility for latent infection has not been sufficiently researched. Conclusion: There are indications that Legionnaires’ disease in the therapy with TNF-α inhibitors is indeed a forthcoming problem. Additional target researches are required in order to establish the position of Legionnaires’ disease in the mosaic of anti - TNF-α therapy...|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{experience}} of 63 antenatal diagnoses of fetal uropathic conditions we discuss the diagnostic problems, practical implications of antenatal diagnosis and potential indications of in utero intervention. A correct diagnosis was established in 43 of the 63 cases (70 per cent). Diagnostic problems were encountered in differentiating among multicystic dysplastic kidneys and ureteropelvic junction obstruction, dilatation owing to reflux or obstruction and lack of visualization of small hypoplastic kidneys. Transitory urinary tract dilatation was found in 14 cases (22 per cent) and can be responsible for additional false positive findings. Evaluation of the thoracic development and amniotic fluid must be part of the examination, since they are related to severe obstructive uropathy. Repeat examinations are necessary in these cases. During evaluation of the eventual benefit of an in utero decompression one should consider the diagnostic difficulties, mainly the time of onset of fetal uropathic conditions during morphogenesis and the absence of a clinically reliable method to evaluate fetal renal function. To date there are no <b>real</b> <b>indications</b> for in utero intervention in most detectable cases.

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringReservoir influxes, or kicks, {{are well}} control {{incidents}} {{with the potential}} of severe consequences to health, safety and the environment, as well as economics. Although the main focus will always be to prevent such incidents from happening, drilling crew will {{also need to be}} able to spot reservoir influx as quickly as possible. This thesis presents a method for automated detection of reservoir influx or losses based on simulations of the surface circulation system. Theoretical background for the causes of reservoir influx is presented. The rig circulation system and traditional mudlogging approaches are discussed, as well as a literature study of proposed new methods for the detection of reservoir influx. Focus has been on conventional drilling, but literature and applications for managed pressure drilling and dual gradient drilling have also been included. MatLab simulation scripts have been generated to investigate the relationship between changes in pump rate and measured volumes at surface. The script is compared to data from the literature, as well as real drilling data, and tuned by the use of adaptive observer technology. Low-pass and high-pass filters are also employed. Simulations show that the real volume behaviour of the circulation system on a drilling rig can be relatively accurately described through simple programming logics. The scripts demonstrate the possibility to remove these dynamics from the volumes being monitored, so that any observed changes will in fact be <b>real</b> <b>indications</b> of volume change. While this thesis only presents the basics for such a method, a further development has the capabilities of being incorporated into an automated system. Fully functioning, this system would allow for setting closer alarms on the monitored volume, resulting in reduced amounts of false alarms as well as earlier kick detection...|$|R
