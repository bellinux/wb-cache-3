Helpful pointers with the village indigobird are the association with its host species, the <b>red-billed</b> <b>firefinch,</b> and its presence near human habitation.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-billed</b> <b>firefinch</b> or Senegal firefinch (Lagonosticta senegala) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird. This estrildid finch is {{a resident}} breeding bird in most of Sub-Saharan Africa with an estimated global extent of occurrence of 10,000,000 km2. This species was introduced to Egypt, however, the introduced population has become extinct.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-billed</b> <b>firefinch</b> is 10 cm in length. The {{adult male}} has entirely scarlet plumage apart from brown wings. The bill is pink, {{and there is}} a yellow eye-ring. Females have uniformly brown upperparts and buff underparts. There is a small red patch in front of both eyes, and the bill is pink.|$|E
50|$|The male {{village indigobird}} is territorial, {{and he has}} an {{elaborate}} courtship flight display. The song is given from a high perch, and consists of rapid sputtering and churring intermingled with mimicry of <b>red-billed</b> <b>firefinch's</b> song, especially the characteristic chick-pea-pea-pea.|$|R
50|$|It is a brood {{parasite}} which lays its eggs in {{the nests}} of <b>red-billed</b> <b>firefinches.</b> Unlike the common cuckoo, it does not destroy the host's egg. Typically, 2-4 eggs are added to those already present. The eggs of both the host and the firefinch are white, although the indigobird's are slightly larger.

Unlike the cuckoos and honeyguides, the indigobirds and whydahs do not destroy the host's eggs. Typically, they lay 2 - 4 eggs in with those already present.

Many of the indigo-plumaged species named [...] "indigobirds" [...] are very similar in appearance, with the males difficult to separate in the field, and the young and females near impossible. The best guide is often the estrildid finch {{with which they are}} associating, since each indigobird parasitises a different host species. For example, the village indigobird is usually found with <b>red-billed</b> <b>firefinches.</b> Indigobirds and whydahs imitate their host's song, which the males learn in the nest. Although females do not sing, they also learn to recognise the song, and choose males with the same song, thus perpetuating the link between each species of indigobird and firefinch. The nestling indigobirds mimic the unique gape pattern of the fledglings of the host species.|$|R
50|$|The <b>red-billed</b> <b>firefinch</b> {{is a small}} {{gregarious bird}} which feeds mainly on grain and other seeds. It frequents open {{grassland}} and cultivation. The nest is a large domed grass structure with a side entrance, built low in a bush, wall or thatch into which three to six white eggs are laid. The nest of this species is parasitised by the village indigobird.|$|E

The highly pathogenic avian influenza (H 5 N 1 subtype) recurred in Nigeria after 9 months period of no reported case. A critical look at possible sources of the re-occurrence was desirable. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether avian influenza viruses were present at reasonably detectable levels (0. 5 %) in possible “bridge ” species of wild and domestic birds. The study was conducted in 8 Nigerian states. A total of 403 birds from 40 species were sampled. Virus isolation was done in embryonated chicken eggs according to standard protocols. The test results were all negative for avian influenza viruses. The overall confidence interval (CI) calculated in R using the exact binomial confidence interval function was 0 – 0. 007406. Tawny Eagle (Aquila rapax) was the lowest sampled 0. 3 % (1 / 403) and <b>Red-billed</b> <b>Firefinch</b> (Lagonosticta senegala) the highest 11. 7 % (47 / 403). The limitations of th...|$|E

Brood-parasitic village indigobirds, Vidua chalybeata, were bred {{in captivity}} and foster-reared by their normal host, <b>red-billed</b> <b>firefinch,</b> Lagonosticta senegala, or by an {{experimental}} foster species, Bengalese finch, Lonchura striata. Male indigobirds reared by Bengalese finches developed {{the songs of}} Bengalese finches, and males reared by firefinches developed songs of firefinches. Males copied their foster father only when they had lived with him long after independence (45 days post-fledging), while males separated normally at independence (22 – 24 days post-fledging) copied songs of other individuals and not songs of their foster father. Males reared by Bengalese finches showed no preference to learn firefinch song over songs of the experimental foster species or other control finch species even when they had lived with firefinches as companions {{from the time of}} fledging to independence. Males copied several song themes, acquired the same number of mimicry songs, and acquired their songs at the same age, whether reared by Bengalese finches or by firefinches. When they lived with other indigobirds, the male indigobirds copied mimicry songs of male indigobirds that mimicked the same foster species. We predicted mimicry-song specificity and repertoire size in experimental indigobirds from a hypothesis of an early developmental period when young indigobirds focus their attention on their foster parents, and a later period when they direct their attention to other birds with similar songs. The predictions, base...|$|E
