30|$|The {{regulatory}} framework defines the cost at which electricity can be offered by prosumers for {{trading on the}} LEM. It is highest when using the public grid, as the entirety of regulated German tariff components has to be paid {{in addition to an}} opportunity cost from a lost feed-in tariff. Prosumers in Germany are currently guaranteed a specific feed-in tariff cF for RES feed-in into the public grid. Thus, this opportunity cost with the addition of taxes, fees and levies stipulates the lower cost bound for selling RES generation on the LEM. In a physical microgrid certain <b>regulated</b> <b>tariff</b> components do not apply. This decreases the possible offer price and opens up a trading window as compared to the national reference tariff of the public grid. With the third case of a favorable {{regulatory framework}} for LEM trading, we study the impact of omitting the renewable surcharge in a LEM. A detailed overview {{of the impact of the}} regulatory framework on possible bid prices is given by Table  1. In a public grid, trading on the LEM would only be possible above the reference tariff. As we only consider LEM trading between the feed-in tariff plus <b>regulated</b> <b>tariff</b> components and the reference tariff, trading will not be economic and is thus not applied in our simulation. However, both the microgrid and favorable regulation scenario offer a trading window between the considered lower and upper LEM price bounds.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model in}} which production of a downstream good requires access to an excludable upstream resource owned by a vertically integrated firm. The quality of the resource depends on an investment made by the owner and impacts the demand curve in the downstream market. Under open access, the owner must share the resource with downstream competitors at a <b>regulated</b> <b>tariff,</b> determined after the investment is made. We show that the owner’s investment exceeds the monopoly level if the access tariff is set according to a principle we call revenue neutrality. Revenue-neutral open access is consistent with current open access laws and requires only limited information on part of the regulator. Furthermore, quality increases {{with the number of}} entrants in the downstream market.

40|$|The {{increase}} in electricity consumption {{has led to}} a sharp {{increase in}} energy demand which has risen environmental and sustainability concerns. To address this issue, there have been incentives, in some countries, to the deployment of renewable energy sources for electricity production. Departing from a real case study, a framework for investment appraisal of a SHP project under the Portuguese present market conditions is proposed and applied. The study departed from the discounted cash-flow evaluation, complemented by both sensitivity and risk analyses, in order to identify the main sources of risk and to assess the probability and impact of each risk event. The results obtained show that {{in the context of a}} <b>regulated</b> <b>tariff</b> the project is worthwhile due to a positive NPV. However, if electricity had to be sold at market prices, the project becomes unprofitable. The results put also in evidence the vulnerability of the investment to an adverse change in interest rates. Future SHP plant investments should take into account the need to operate in a free market and to compete with technologies based on fossil fuels or large hydro...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a geographic dimension not often {{studied in the}} dynamics of creating an internal market for electricity within the European Union, namely the case of small European electricity systems like those found on the Greek islands of Cyprus and Crete. Our question, then, is how to achieve a suitable internal market for electricity in small and isolated systems. To address this issue, we identify the main problems to be overcome by introducing a methodology in which the Canary Islands experience is taken {{as a case study}} for understanding the challenges in creating an "EU-like market for electricity". Our results show that the design of the vertical industrial structure and the figure of the grid operator and its attributes are key features for the proper operation of any electrical system. We also stress the minor roles of other possible options to achieve this EU-compatible market by highlighting first, in the wholesale market, the call-for-tender solution to introduce more generation and the risk of using safety requirements as barriers to entry in these small markets, and second, in the supply activities, the potential problems of an improperly <b>regulated</b> <b>tariff</b> scheme.

40|$|In {{order to}} fulfil its {{aspiration}} {{to become a}} middle-income country, Tanzania is working on improving infrastructure and service delivery in electricity provision, where $ 40 billion investment is needed in the sector to meet rising demand and widening electrification efforts from 2013 to 2035. This paper considers the institutional arrangements for investment in Tanzaniaâs power sector and surveys the track record (and possible bottlenecks) in funnelling investment to the sector, with special attention given to the gas sector, given the power sectorâs planned reliance upon natural gas as a generation fuel. The paper finds that the financial health of TANESCO is central to all investment vehicles, since it is either directly responsible for investment, or indirectly, as the counter party to the variety of PPAs available with IPPs, EPPs, SPPs, or PPPs. During 2011 â 13, the financial position of TANESCO was negatively impacted by the increased of its electricity purchases, while the <b>regulated</b> <b>tariff</b> that it charges has not changed. The cost increase is partially attributable to non-favourable hydrology and partially attributable to the depreciation of Tanzanian shilling against the US dollar, in which PPAs are denominated. Detailed study of the tariff setting methodology in place in Tanzania, as evidenced through its latest tariff review, and evaluation of the ratemaking principles used in the tariff approved in 2013 reveals that the core tension within Tanzaniaâs tariff setting methodology is the trade-off between efficiency, sufficiency, and stability principles. The ex-ante assessment of TANESCOâs revenue requirement, a typical incentive-based price cap regulation, is theoretically efficient but not robust: TANESCOâs costs of service are subject to important external uncertainties like hydrology, currency depreciation, and global fuel prices. In order to take revenue sufficiency into account, the regulator needs to periodically adjust tariffs based on ex post fuel costs and inflation rates. This diminishes the regulatorâs ability to maintain tariff stability, which might impact certain classes of customers more than others (lifeline rate customers and domestic industries). The experiences of other nations, namely Bangladesh and CÃ´te dâIvoire, reveal a potential challenge with regard to power and gas co-development: if non-cost reflective gas tariffs are applied as a regulatory decision, then high gas demand that results from that cannot be indefinitely sustained, since investment in gas supply will not follow suite. The case study of CÃ´te dâIvoire also reveals a less obvious opportunity: periods of low electricity demand can be leveraged positively through electricity exports, which can positively influence investor interest...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the article is to apply the {{mechanism}} of cross-differentiated electricity tariffication to the existing system of <b>regulated</b> <b>tariffs</b> {{in accordance with the}} structure chain of ?prices-tariffs-contracts?. With this purpose methods of regulated pricing are divided into three groups of methods which are one way or another orientated towards the processes of electricity supply or electricity consumption according to their mechanism of <b>regulated</b> prices (<b>tariffs)</b> calculation. It is shown that cross-differentiated tariffication makes use of system approach to form electricity tariffs and that is more powerful mechanism than discriminatory pricing. Correspondence between electricity tariffs and possible indications of differentiation has been analyzed. The mechanism of cross-differentiated tariffication has been illustrated. As a result in the existing system of electricity tariffs integrated and differentiated by time, subsystems of one-part and multipart tariffs have been formed as well as subsystems of one-component and multicomponent tariffs. Connections between the formed tariffs subsystems are established. Correspondence between the formed electricity tariffs subsystems and contracts using for electricity supply is shown (forward, call option, put option). ????? ?????? ???????? ?????????? ????????? ??????????? ?????????????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ? ???????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????? ?????? ? ?????????????? ??????????? ??????? ?????-??????-??????????. ? ???? ????? ?????? ????????????? ??????????????? ??????? ?? ??? ?????? ???????, ??????? ???????? ?????? ????????? ??????? ???????????? ???

40|$|When {{access to}} {{monopoly}} owned networks is constrained auctioning access rights {{can increase the}} efficiency of allocations relative to negotiation and grandfathering when there is sufficient competition among network users. Historically, access rights to entry capacity on the British gas network were granted by the monopoly network owner via negotiation; rights were later based on <b>regulated</b> <b>tariffs</b> with an increasing reliance on market based constraint resolution by the system operator. In 1999 an auction mechanism for allocating rights was introduced. Comparing the different allocation methods we conclude that where there is competition at entry terminals auctions have been successful with respect to anticipating spot prices, capturing producer rents and reducing the costs of alleviating network constraints. Moreover, auctions are more transparent and better facilitate entry. gas, network, access, auction, regulation...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} concern with sustainable development, renewable energy sources (RES) emerge as an important alternative for electricity production. In this context, for countries like Portugal, hydropower plants assume an important role and several incentives have been granted {{by the government to}} promote hydroelectric production. However, due to the deep economic and financial crisis of the last years, a change in the energy paradigm is taking place increasing the perceived risk factors for RES electricity producers. Therefore, this paper focus on identifying and assessing the impact of those risks associated with an investment in a small hydropower (SHP). Although the independent analysis of each risk variable showed that the project is worthwhile, the possibility of having a negative outcome was evident for the investment costs, discount rate and feed-in-tariffs variables.
