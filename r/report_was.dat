5|$|Boyle {{sponsored}} a motion of non-confidence against the government. Despite enjoying {{the support of}} twelve Liberals, including Cushing, the motion was defeated and the government upheld. Rutherford attempted to quell the controversy by calling a royal commission, but pressure from many Liberals, including Bulyea, led him to resign May 26, 1910; he was replaced by Arthur Sifton, hitherto the province's chief judge. In November, the royal commission issued its report. It found that the evidence did not show {{a conflict of interest}} on Rutherford's part, but the majority <b>report</b> <b>was</b> nevertheless highly critical of the former Premier. A minority <b>report</b> <b>was</b> much kinder, avowing perfect satisfaction with Rutherford's version of events.|$|E

5|$|In February 1995, SINTEF {{handed over}} a report {{ordered by the}} {{commission}} which revealed several absent safety procedures in Widerøe. The <b>report</b> <b>was</b> based on a recommendation by the International Civil Aviation Organization {{to take into consideration}} the organizational structure the aircraft operate within when investigating aviation accidents. In June, parliamentarian Magnus Stangeland criticized the commission for working too slow, stating that the victims and next of kin needed answers to why the accident happened. The lack of cooperation between the police and the commission was the main source of the delays. Similar delays had occurred after Partnair Flight 394 in 1989, which had resulted in the statute of limitations having come into effect by the time the <b>report</b> <b>was</b> published. A temporary <b>report</b> <b>was</b> presented to the survivors and next of kin on 20 March 1996; the report laid the responsibility for the accident on the airline. The final <b>report</b> <b>was</b> published on 10 July 1996 and laid the responsibility for the accident on the company and its operating routines. The report contained 26 recommendations for improvements for the company. The Norwegian Prosecuting Authority decided in September 1997 not to charge Widerøe for the accident.|$|E
