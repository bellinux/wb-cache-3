2500|$|Distortion is {{a feature}} {{available}} on many guitar amplifiers {{that is not}} typically found on keyboard or bass guitar amplifiers. Tube guitar amplifiers can produce distortion through pre-distortion equalization, preamp tube distortion, post-distortion EQ, power-tube distortion, tube rectifier compression, output transformer distortion, guitar speaker distortion, and guitar speaker and cabinet frequency response. Because many factors beyond preamp distortion contribute to a particular guitarist's sound, recording engineers and PA system techs typically put a microphone {{in front of the}} guitar speaker, rather than only use the guitar amp's pre-amp out signal. [...] A sound engineer or music producer may send the DI out signal from the pickups to a separate track at the same time, so they can <b>re-amp</b> the signal later. In contrast, it is fairly common to use a DI box with electric bass.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{advantage}} of re-amping {{is that it}} enables producers and band members to have more options for remixing and redoing a recording {{a long time after}} the original recording. If the original recording of a song with electric guitar is done in 1985, and the electric guitarist's sound was only recorded with a mic in front of her/his combo amp or speaker cabinet, the recording will lock in the specific type of distortion, reverb, flanger processing and other effects that were used, which might sound [...] "dated" [...] several decades later.

25|$|<b>Re-amping</b> is {{a process}} often used in {{multitrack}} recording in which a recorded signal is routed {{back out of the}} editing environment and run through external processing using effects units and then into a guitar amplifier and a guitar speaker cabinet or a reverb chamber. Originally, the technique was used mostly for electric guitars: it facilitates a separation of guitar playing from guitar amplifier processing—a previously recorded audio program is played back and re-recorded at a later time for the purpose of adding effects, ambiance such as reverb or echo, and the tone shaping imbued by certain amps and cabinets. The technique has since evolved over the 2000s to include many other applications. <b>Re-amping</b> can also be applied to other instruments and program, such as recorded drums, synthesizers, and virtual instruments.|$|R

500|$|For the {{majority}} of the recordings, Saadiq played most of the instruments, including bass, keyboard, guitar, Mellotron, percussion, and drums, and he also layered each recorded instrumental part afterwards. Brungardt used a Neumann U 47 microphone to record each of Saadiq's instrument parts. Saadiq recorded his vocals on a dynamic microphone alone in the recording studio's control room, an approach encouraged to him earlier in his career by record producer and audio engineer Gerry Brown. According to Brungardt, [...] " [...] voice benefits from a dynamic mic because it tends to give him more bottom and presence. Plus dynamic mics can sound a little older when pushed". With the songs' guitar parts, Brungardt wanted to create additional distortion in order to produce a grittier guitar sound for the songs, a stylistic preference Saadiq and he had acquired from listening to a great deal of indie rock at the time. He applied several techniques to achieve this sound, including increasing the gain on Saadiq's Fender Twin guitar amplifier, using a software plug-in for the recordings in post-production, and <b>re-amping</b> Saadiq's guitar parts. In his interview for EQ Magazine, Brungardt discussed using a Massey TapeHead, one of his preferred plug-ins, in the recording process, stating [...] "I’ll use that {{on a lot of things}} to get a little more grit. It thickens stuff up nicely if you record something that’s a little too bright. I usually go a lot for darker tones when recording and mixing".|$|R
