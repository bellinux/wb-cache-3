50|$|RUNNING â†’ READY The {{most common}} {{reason for this}} {{transition}} is that the running process has reached the maximum allowable time for uninterrupted execution; i.e. time-out occurs. Other reasons can be the imposition of priority levels {{as determined by the}} scheduling policy used for the Low Level Scheduler, and the arrival of a higher priority process into the <b>READY</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 2005, {{the airline}} and its Ukrainian competitor, Antonov Airlines, formed a partnership, Ruslan Salis, which signed a three-year {{contract}} with NATO to provide strategic airlift services to the alliance's Strategic Airlift Interim Solution (SALIS). The contract was renewable through 2012, and required Ruslan to maintain two An-124 aircraft in a <b>ready</b> <b>state</b> in Leipzig, Germany, with an additional four An-124 aircraft available if needed.|$|E
50|$|The Titan IV {{was made}} up of two large solid-fuel rocket {{boosters}} and a two-stage liquid-fueled core. The two storable liquid fuel core stages used Aerozine 50 fuel and nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer. These propellants are hypergolic (ignite on contact) and are liquids at room temperature, so no tank insulation is needed. This allows the launcher to be stored in a <b>ready</b> <b>state</b> for extended periods. However, both propellants are extremely toxic.|$|E

50|$|Prior to {{the concept}} of shiftability, the {{orthodox}} theory of banking limited banks to making short-term commercial loans to help producers of goods during their business cycles. For example, apple farmers may require short-term financing until the crop is ready for sale. This theory postulates that by making short-term commercial transactions that will mature in a timely manner will keep banks in a <b>ready</b> <b>state</b> {{to meet the demands of}} their depositors.|$|E
5000|$|SUSPEND READY then READY When {{there are}} no READY {{processes}} in main memory, the OS will need to bring one in to continue execution. In addition, {{it might be the}} case that a process in the READY SUSPEND state has higher priority than any of the processes in the <b>READY</b> <b>state.</b> In that case, the OS designer may dictate that {{it is more important to}} get at the higher priority process than to minimise swapping.|$|E
5000|$|Optimistic: In Optimistic {{concurrency}} control data access operations of other transactions are not blocked upon conflicts, and conflicts are immediately materialized. When the transaction reaches the <b>ready</b> <b>state,</b> i.e., its running {{state has been}} completed, possible serializability (and in practice also recoverability) violation by the transaction's operations (relatively to other running transactions) is checked: If violation has occurred, the transaction is typically aborted (sometimes aborting another transaction to handle serializability violation is preferred). Otherwise it is committed.|$|E

Phaseout of the B-58 fleet was ordered by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara in December 1965, since {{it was felt that}} the high-altitude performance of the B-58 could no longer guarantee success against increasingly sophisticated Soviet air defenses.

50|$|The R-7 and Atlas each {{required}} a large launch facility, making them vulnerable to attack, {{and could not}} be kept in a <b>ready</b> <b>state.</b> Failure rates were very high throughout the early years of ICBM technology. Human spaceflight programs (Vostok, Mercury, Voskhod, Gemini, etc.) served as a highly visible means of demonstrating confidence in reliability, with successes translating directly to national defense implications. The US was well behind the Soviet Union in the Space Race, so U.S. President John F. Kennedy increased the stakes with the Apollo program, which used Saturn rocket technology that had been funded by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.|$|E
