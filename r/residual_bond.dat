40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the uncertainties associated with using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as reinforcement for cement. These uncertainties emerge {{mainly from the}} CNTs' wide range of mechanical properties and their interfacial behavior with cement. This study sheds light {{on the basis of}} choosing the optimal combinations of CNTs mechanical and interfacial parameters to improve the structural strength and ductility of CNT-reinforced cementitious composites. The finite element method (FEM) is employed to study the individual and interactive effects of five parameters, including interfacial shear (bond) strength, allowable slip, CNT Young's modulus, <b>residual</b> <b>bond</b> stress and aspect ratio. Numerical results show that the parameters, at certain ranges of values, interact substantially and greatly alter the mechanical properties of the composite. It is also found that the governing parameter is the CNT Young's modulus, which determines whether the composite is ductility critical or strength critical. Furthermore, the level of <b>residual</b> <b>bond</b> stress substantially influences the effect of other parameters, {{especially in the case of}} composite ductility...|$|E
40|$|Extensive {{research}} has been conducted on static bond behaviour between CFRP and steel. However, very limited research is available on the effect of fatigue loading on the bond behaviour between CFRP and steel. This paper attempts to fill the knowledge gap in this area. A series of static and fatigue tests on UHM (ultra high modulus) CFRP plate and steel plate double strap joints were conducted. Five specimens were tensioned to failure under static loading as control specimens. The other 12 specimens were tested under fatigue loading with load ratios ranging from 0. 2 to 0. 6 (defined as the ratio of the maximum fatigue load to the average static bond strength of control specimens). After going through pre-set number of fatigue cycles, the specimens were tensioned to failure under static loading. The failure modes, <b>residual</b> <b>bond</b> strength and <b>residual</b> <b>bond</b> stiffness of such specimens were compared with those of control specimens, to facilitate the investigation of the effect of fatigue loading on the bond behaviour. Microscopic investigation was also performed to reveal the underlying failure mechanism...|$|E

We first consider Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs), securities created by dividing {{a pool of}} mortgages into senior and residual tranches. We find that senior CMO bonds can be risk-free, low-risk or high-risk in equilibrium, depending on the relative size of the senior tranche. We extend the basic framework to value CMO-squared, securities created by pooling residual CMO bonds and dividing the pool into tranches. We find that senior CMO-squared bonds are riskier than senior CMO bonds of the same size, when CMO-squared are created using residual CMO bonds. Finally, we value Credit Default Swaps (CDSs), securities that provide insurance against default. For house price data from the Case-Shiller index between 2006 and 2011, we find that senior CMO bond prices decline by 10 % and <b>residual</b> <b>bond</b> prices decline by 60 %. The price declines experienced by CMO-squared bonds are larger: senior bond prices drop 50 % and <b>residual</b> <b>bond</b> prices drop 100 %.

5000|$|The {{structure}} of gibbsite is interesting and {{analogous to the}} basic {{structure of}} the micas. The basic structure forms stacked sheets of linked octahedrons of aluminium hydroxide. The octahedrons are composed of aluminium ions with a +3 charge bonded to six octahedrally coordinated hydroxides with a -1 charge. Each of the hydroxides is bonded to only two aluminium atoms because one third of the octahedrons are vacant a central aluminium. The result is a neutral sheet since +3/6 = +1/2 (+3 charge on the aluminiums divided by six hydroxide bonds times the number of aluminiums) and -1/2 = -1/2 (-1 charge on the hydroxides divided between only two aluminiums); thus the charges cancel. The lack of a charge on the gibbsite sheets means that there is no charge to retain ions between the sheets and act as a [...] "glue" [...] to keep the sheets together. The sheets are only held together by weak <b>residual</b> <b>bonds</b> and this results in a very soft easily cleaved mineral.|$|R

An enclosed system was built in which the authors used liquid ammonia to dissolve the lithium bond, alcohol to rinse and clean the retrieved specimens, and chemical getters (containing a reactive metal alloy) to trap the released tritium gas. The main processing units of the system are inside a hot cell and the remainder are in a vented cabinet.

The method of crucible rotating oscillation damping is employed to measure the kinematic viscosity of Mg- 9 Al melt, and the curve of viscosity nu versus temperature T from 890 K to 1190 K is obtained. It is found {{that there is an}} abnormal change for the viscosity in the first heating process, i. e., when the temperature is increased to 1000 - 1075 K, the viscosity varies from increase to decrease. However, in the subsequent cooling process and the second heating process, the viscosity increases (decreases) monotonically according to an exponential law with temperature, which accords with the Arrhenius equation. Based on the <b>residual</b> <b>bond</b> model and the calculation model for evolution behavior of "average atomic cluster", the correlation between viscosity and microstructure of Mg- 9 Al melt is discussed. The results show that the breakage of Al-Al-(B) bonds in basic unit of beta phase-like <b>residual</b> <b>bond</b> structures causes an abnormal change of viscosity in the first heating process; in the subsequent cooling process and the second heating process, the melt reaches a new dynamic equilibrium state, and Al atoms are uniformly distributed in the melt.

40|$|This paper reports {{results of}} an {{experimental}} programme to measure changes in bond characteristics of plain round reinforcement {{as a result of}} corrosion. Principal parameters included in the investigation are the amount of corrosion, the presence of confining reinforcement in the form of links, cover thickness and the initial condition of the reinforcement. In the absence of confining links, bond strength of bars cast near the bottom of a pour is found to reduce with increasing corrosion. However, although top-cast bars were initially weaker, small amounts of corrosion were sufficient to raise bond strength to that of bottom-cast bars. With increasing corrosion, strength reduced in a similar manner to bottom-cast bars. Confining reinforcement had little influence on bond strength prior to the onset of corrosion, but {{plays an important role in}} maintaining strength once corrosion becomes established.

Materials and Methods: The present study was a comparative study, in which brackets were bonded on forty freshly extracted human premolar teeth. They were debonded after 24 h and removal of remnant adhesive to {{as close as possible}} to the original condition using tungsten carbide burs (TCBs) (30 flutted) with low-speed contra-angle handpiece, Super Snap ® discs (course, medium, fine, and superfine), TCB + Brownie and Greenie (BG) polishers, and TCB + Super Snap ® discs. The surfaces were evaluated under SEM and graded according to the modified surface roughness index. Time taken to remove the residual adhesive was recorded using a stopwatch. Results were subjected to statistical analysis. Results: Super Snap ® discs showed a smooth surface with minimal scratches. TCB resulted in an irregular enamel surface in SEM evaluation, showing horizontal scars with a consistent pattern and left remnants on the enamel surfaces. TCB followed by Super Snap ® discs produced some scratches on the enamel surface. The mean time was significantly higher in Group I than the other three groups (P = 0. 000). The mean time was significantly lower in Group II than the other three groups (P = 0. 000). TCB took the least amount of time followed by TCB + stainless steel and TCB + BG polishers. Conclusion: Enamel surface was restored as close to the original using the Super Snap ® discs. TCB produced a very rough surface, but it is an efficient and least time-consuming procedure. The resultant enamel surface with enamel scars needs to be finished by other polishing techniques after bulk removal using TCB as the sequential use of Super Snap ® discs and polishers is less aggressive in removing <b>residual</b> <b>bonding</b> resin and results in apparently better surface finish causing less damage to the enamel...|$|R

However, since many R/C structures survive a fire and require their residual safety level to be assessed, knowing bond properties and having information on tension stiffening in residual conditions is a necessary step to reliably analyze the structural behavior past a fire. In this preliminary research project, tension stiffening is investigated by testing a number of R/C tension members exposed to a severe fire (temperature-time curve comprised between the hydrocarbon and the standard fires in the first 20 minutes, and exposure to 750 °C for further 100 minutes). After two hours, the average temperature of the specimens was close to 650 °C. An electric furnace was used for heating the specimens, once at a time, and natural cooling followed inside the furnace.

30|$|It {{was found}} that stable latex was {{obtained}} when 2.5 wt% of MBA was used, and the resultant latex remained stable even after centrifugation at 12, 000 rpm for 1 h. With MBA content increased to 5.0 wt%, the polymer precipitated out from the reaction mixture; phase separation occurred immediately upon the bottle shaking was stopped. Coagulation appeared when the MBA amount further increased to 12.5 wt%. It is commonly agreed that particle nucleation in this precipitation polymerization is done by oligomers grown up to a critical length, where they become insoluble and precipitate out to form the primary particles. This nucleation proceeds quite fast, and abundant primary particles can be formed in a short period. Once this period of nucleation is completed, particle growth is continued by an entropy mechanism as proposed by Stöver et al. [25], by which the monomers and the oligomers, prior to reaching their critical length, polymerize with the <b>residual</b> double <b>bonds</b> {{on the surface of}} the particles, instead of by adsorption of oligomers after reaching their critical length (i.e., by enthalpy mechanism).|$|R
