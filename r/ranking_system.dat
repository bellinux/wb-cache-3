To help players have an enjoyable time online, several peace-of-mind features are implemented within easy reach, such as avoid/feedback options on a player's service record, as well as voice chat mute straight from the in-game scoreboard.

40|$|The global {{expansion}} {{of access to}} higher education has increased demand for information on academic quality and has {{led to the development of}} university <b>ranking</b> <b>systems</b> or league tables in many countries of the world. A recent UNESCO/CEPES Conference on higher education indicators concluded that cross-national research on these <b>ranking</b> <b>systems</b> could make an important contribution to improving the international market for higher education. The comparison and analysis of national university <b>ranking</b> <b>systems</b> can help address a number of important policy questions. First, is there an emerging global consensus on the measurement of academic quality in these <b>ranking</b> <b>systems?</b> Second, what impact are the different <b>ranking</b> <b>systems</b> having on university and academic behavior in their respective countries? Finally, are there important public interests that are thus far not reflected in these rankings?
