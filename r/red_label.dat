These mesh jerseys are similar to the home and road versions, but with [...] "Music City" [...] written across the chest, no names on the back, and [...] "Nashville" [...] sewn in red letters under the Athletics sleeve logo. They are usually paired with a cap with the letters [...] "MC", for [...] "Music City", over a guitar pick. Alternate red jerseys with printed graphics are worn for all Friday home games. These jerseys are made from red material with black and white striping at the neck opening and bands of silver, black, and white around the sleeve openings.

The player's number is located below the city's name on the player's left chest in silver characters with a white border and a black drop shadow. The number is also displayed on the back in white lettering with a silver border and black drop shadow.

40|$|Dichloroflavan {{was found}} to {{stabilize}} rhinovirus IB to inactivation by heat at 56 °C or by acid at pH 4 - 6 to 50. The effects of dichloroflavan, arildone and sodium dodecyl sulphate on uncoating of virus in M. HeLa cells were compared by examining (a) the production of sub-viral particles separated on sucrose density gradients; (b) the development of photoresistance by neutral <b>red</b> <b>labelled</b> virus. All three compounds significantly reduced but did not completely suppress the production of sub-viral particles. They also affected the uncoating of neutral <b>red</b> <b>labelled</b> virus, although dichloroflavan appeared to delay rather than prevent this process. A variant of rhinovirus 1 B, isolated by growth {{in the presence of}} dichloroflavan, showed increased resistance to inhibition by arildone and SDS as well as dichloro-flavan, suggesting a similar site of action for the three compounds...|$|R

6000|$|The {{apartment}} in which Filmer {{came to his}} last solution was a pleasant little room very simply furnished with green furniture and an old bureau--for Banghurst was simple in all his private ways.

But as it happened, Banghurst had left a rook rifle he sometimes played with {{on the top of the}} desk, and on the corner of the mantelshelf was a tin with three or four cartridges remaining in it.

So, as there was no good place in their bodies in which to put brains the Fairy Queen gave each one of us a nice can of brains to carry in his pocket and that made us just as intelligent as other people.

60|$|Mr. Pickwick {{stood up}} {{in a state of}} great agitation, and took a glance at the court. There were already a pretty large {{sprinkling}} of spectators in the gallery, and a numerous muster of gentlemen in wigs, in the barristers' seats, who presented, as a body, all that pleasing and extensive variety of nose and whisker for which the Bar of England is so justly celebrated. Such of the gentlemen as had a brief to carry, carried it in as conspicuous a manner as possible, and occasionally scratched their noses therewith, to impress the fact more strongly on the observation of the spectators. Other gentlemen, who had no briefs to show, carried under their arms goodly octavos, with a <b>red</b> <b>label</b> behind, and that under-done-pie-crust-coloured cover, which is technically known as 'law calf.' Others, who had neither briefs nor books, thrust their hands into their pockets, and looked as wise as they conveniently could; others, again, moved here and there with great restlessness and earnestness of manner, content to awaken thereby the admiration and astonishment of the uninitiated strangers. The whole, to the great wonderment of Mr. Pickwick, were divided into little groups, who were chatting and discussing {{the news of the day}} in the most unfeeling manner possible--just as if no trial at all were coming on.|$|E
6000|$|It was a {{large and}} lofty room in which the young baronet found himself. The carpet was so soft and thick that his feet made no sound as he walked across it. The two gas jets were turned only half-way up, and the dim light with the faint {{aromatic}} smell which filled the air had a vaguely religious suggestion. He {{sat down in a}} shining leather armchair by the smouldering fire and looked gloomily about him. Two sides of the room were taken up with books, fat and sombre, with broad gold lettering upon their backs. Beside him was the high, old-fashioned mantelpiece of white marble--the top of it strewed with cotton wadding and bandages, graduated measures, and little bottles. There was one with a broad neck just above him containing bluestone, and another narrower one with what looked like the ruins of a broken pipestem and [...] "Caustic" [...] outside upon a <b>red</b> <b>label.</b> Thermometers, hypodermic syringes bistouries and spatulas were scattered about both on the mantelpiece and on the central table {{on either side of the}} sloping desk. On the same table, to the right, stood copies of the five books which Dr. Horace Selby had written upon the subject with which his name is peculiarly associated, while on the left, on the top of a red medical directory, lay a huge glass model of a human eye the size of a turnip, which opened down the centre to expose the lens and double chamber within.|$|E

50|$|Critics of the <b>Red</b> <b>Label</b> mostly {{complain}} about {{the weight of the}} shotgun, the poor fitting of the metal to wood on some guns, and the automatic safety which could be disabled by the factory if requested by the owner. Although originally conceived as a quality affordable alternative to pricey hand-made European shotguns, by {{the first decade of the}} 21st century the <b>Red</b> <b>Label</b> itself with a MSRP of around $2,000.00 had become too expensive for the average shooter to even consider purchasing and sales dropped. The <b>Red</b> <b>Label</b> was discontinued by Ruger in 2011.|$|E
40|$|Comparative genomic {{hybridisation}} (CGH) is {{a technique}} that permits the detection of chromosomal copy number changes {{without the need for}} cell culturing. It provides a global overview of chromosomal gains and losses throughout the whole genome of a tumour. Tumour DNA is labelled with a green fluorochrome, which is subsequently mixed (1 : 1) with <b>red</b> <b>labelled</b> normal DNA and hybridised to normal human metaphase preparations. The green and <b>red</b> <b>labelled</b> DNA fragments compete for hybridisation to their locus of origin on the chromosomes. The green to red fluorescence ratio measured along the chromosomal axis represents loss or gain of genetic material in the tumour at that specific locus. In addition to a fluorescence microscope, the technique requires a computer with dedicated image analysis software to perform the analysis. This review aims to provide a detailed discussion of the CGH technique, and to provide a protocol with an emphasis on crucial steps...|$|R
