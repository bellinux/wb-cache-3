After 1872, the coat of arms included the symbol of southern Bessarabia (after 1877, of Dobruja), two dolphins in the fourth quarter, and the one of Oltenia, a golden lion, in the third quarter; on the shield the Steel Crown was placed, as a symbol of sovereignty and independence, after the Romanian War of Independence.|$|E
50|$|<b>Regarding</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> {{issue of}} {{political}} funding, {{a group of}} parliamentarians belonging to the ruling LDP estimated in 1987 that annual expenses for ten newly elected members of the Diet averaged ¥120 million each, or about US$800,000. This figure, which included expenses for staff and constituent services in a member's home district, including local supporters, was less than the average for Diet members as a whole, because long-term incumbents tended to incur higher expenses. Yet in the late 1980s, the government provided each Diet member with only ¥20 million for annual operating expenses, leaving ¥100 million to be obtained through private contributions, political party faction bosses, or other means. The lack of public funding meant that politicians—especially, but not exclusively, members of the LDP— needed constant infusions of cash or milk money to stay in office.|$|E

40|$|Today, {{many who}} are {{involved}} in the governance of urban development and housing plea for area-based strategies to tackle urban social problems. Various arguments may be given to legitimise that kind of policy intervention. In this paper the assumptions behind the policy application are evaluated. Recurrent discourses and ideas <b>regarding</b> <b>the</b> <b>backgrounds</b> of neighbourhood effects receive extra attention. That discussion will be followed by a critical evaluation of the views that are expressed, both in the literature and through interviews with key actors. Finally, the question will be raised whether {{it is a good idea}} to continue with area-based policies or whether it might be wiser to replace the area-based policies by domain or sector policies in order to achieve a more direct approach towards the problems that should be tackled.

40|$|The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) {{constraints}} on string inspired 'brane inflation' are investigated. Here, the inflaton field is {{interpreted as the}} distance between two branes placed in a flux-enriched background geometry and has a Dirac–Born–Infeld (DBI) kinetic term. Our method relies on an exact numerical integration of the inflationary power spectra coupled to a Markov chain Monte Carlo exploration of the parameter space. This analysis is valid for any perturbative value of the string coupling constant and of the string length, and includes a phenomenological modelling of the reheating era to describe the post-inflationary evolution. It is found that the data favour a scenario where inflation stops by violation of the slow-roll conditions well before brane annihilation, rather than by tachyonic instability.
