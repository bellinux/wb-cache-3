50|$|The metal inserts {{provide support}} for bearings, shafts, gears and other metal {{components}} of the gearbox. The composite gear housing does not remove heat as efficiently as an aluminum or magnesium housing. Composite gear housings require more expensive and reliable cooling systems. However, composite plastic material is widely used on low-power applications such as gear motors for electromechanical actuators. Lightly loaded rotary gear actuators can be completely made of composite plastic material. Such electromechanical rotary actuators are installed, for example, on power windows of automobiles. Higher loaded actuators can contain metallic gears inside plastic composite housing for <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> and corrosion resistance.|$|E

5000|$|Josiah Wedgwood (12 July 1730 - 3 January 1795) was an English {{potter and}} entrepreneur. He founded the Wedgwood company. He is {{credited}} with the industrialisation of the manufacture of pottery; [...] "...it was by intensifying the division of labour that Wedgwood brought about the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> which enabled his pottery to find markets {{in all parts of}} Britain, and also of Europe and America." [...] The renewed classical enthusiasms of the late 1760s and early 1770s were of major importance to his sales promotion. His expensive goods were in much demand from the nobility, while he used emulation effects to market cheaper sets to the rest of society. Every new invention that Wedgwood produced - green glaze, creamware, black basalt and jasper - was quickly copied. Having once achieved perfection in production, he achieved perfection in sales and distribution. His showrooms in London gave the public the chance to see his complete range of tableware.|$|E

50|$|From a lithographic quality {{point of}} view, pitch {{quartering}} with 193 nm immersion {{is better than}} EUV single exposure. For example, 18 nm half-pitch with 0.33 NA EUV has k1=0.44, while 4x18=72 nm half-pitch with 1.35 NA immersion gives k1=0.50. The ≈14% advantage is always maintained across target pitch. The difficulty increases faster as k1 drops below 0.35. On the other hand, multiple passes would present another difficulty for quadruple patterning. Properly shaping the mandrel is not trivial. Long lines running in one direction require the most cuts; a cut exposure and mask is needed for every path turn. In contrast, spacer patterns with path turns already included do not require cutting if they are used for encapsulating metal.As the number of masks for a given layer increases, the cost for patterning that layer also increases. It is especially severe when a layer previously requiring only one mask now requires two masks; {{in this case the}} cost may roughly be expected to be doubled. On the other hand, the reduced device area from the reduced pitch allows the cost per device to be reduced. The larger pitch reduction allows a larger <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> per device, which counters the effect of increasing mask count.|$|E
