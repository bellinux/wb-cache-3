50|$|Located {{between the}} fourth {{ventricle}} and the <b>roofplate,</b> the rhombic lip extends from r1-r8 {{and can be}} divided into upper, or cerebellar, and lower, or hindbrain, portions as the brainstem bends during later development. Expression of Math1, a transcription factor with a basic helix-loop-helix structure, governs the germinal epithelium of the rhombic lip and is expressed in midbrain and hindbrain regions as early as embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5). Math 1-null mice have been shown to lack several rhombic lip derivatives, including the granule neurons of the cerebellum and the pontine nucleus of the precerebellar system. The rhombic lip is organized according to a temporal fate map in which Math1-expressing precursors that first emigrate from the germinative layer (prior to E12.5) become deep nuclear neurons, while those exiting later (E13) become granule cells. Chick-quail chimera experiments have shown that r1 is the most likely source of granule cell precursors. Inside the rhombic lip, granule cell precursors divide and develop a unipolar morphology, with a single process that projects toward their destination.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Human {{retinoic acid}} {{teratogenesis}} results in malformations of dorsally derived hindbrain {{structures such as}} the cerebellum, noradrenergic hindbrain neurons and the precerebellar system. These structures originate from the rhombic lip and adjacent dorsal precursor pools that border the fourth ventricle <b>roofplate.</b> While retinoic acid synthesis is known {{to occur in the}} meninges that blanket the hindbrain, the particular sensitivity of only dorsal structures to disruptions in retinoid signalling is puzzling. We therefore looked for evidence within the neural tube for more spatiotemporally specific signalling pathways using an in situ hybridisation screen of known retinoic acid pathway transcripts. Results We find that there are highly restricted domains of retinoic acid synthesis and breakdown within specific hindbrain nuclei as well as the ventricular layer and <b>roofplate.</b> Intriguingly, transcripts of cellular retinoic acid binding protein 1 are always found at the interface between dividing and post-mitotic cells. By contrast to earlier stages of development, domains of synthesis and breakdown in post-mitotic neurons are co-localised. At the rhombic lip, expression of the mRNA for retinoic acid synthesising and catabolising enzymes is spatially highly organised with respect to the Cath 1 -positive precursors of migratory precerebellar neurons. Conclusion The late developing hindbrain shows patterns of retinoic acid synthesis and use that are distinct from the well characterised phase of rostrocaudal patterning. Selected post-mitotic populations, such as the locus coeruleus, appear to both make and break down retinoic acid suggesting that a requirement for an autocrine, or at least a highly localised paracrine signalling network, might explain its acute sensitivity to retinoic acid disruption. At the rhombic lip, retinoic acid is likely to act as a dorsalising factor in parallel with other <b>roofplate</b> signalling pathways. While its precise role is unclear, retinoic acid is potentially well placed to regulate temporally determined cell fate decisions within the rhombic lip precursor pool. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe rhombic lip is a {{discrete}} strip of neuroepithelium bordering the <b>roofplate</b> {{of the fourth}} ventricle, which {{gives rise to a}} defined sequence of migratory neuronal derivatives. In rhombomere 1 of the chick, early born cells give rise to post-mitotic hindbrain nuclei, while later derivatives comprise of cerebellar granule cell precursors, a unique proliferative, migratory precursor population that forms the external granule cell layer. We have examined the temporal specification of these two populations using a heterochronic grafting strategy, in ovo. When transplanted into younger neural tube, rhombic lip cells maintain their characteristic molecular markers and migrate into the hindbrain. Granule cell precursor derivatives of late grafts are, in addition, able to exploit neural crest streams to populate the branchial arches. Within the neural tube, derivatives of early and late rhombic lip progenitors display patterns of migration and process extension, characterised by specific trajectories and targets, which are consistent with their temporal origin. However, the normal temporal progression of cell production is disrupted in grafted progenitors: transplanted early rhombic lip fails to subsequently produce granule cell precursors. This indicates that, while the behaviour of derivatives is intrinsically specified at the rhombic lip, the orderly temporal transition in cell type production is dependent on extrinsic cues present only in the later embryo...|$|E
