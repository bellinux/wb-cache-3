In this double-blind RCT, term infants (<2 months old) were fed until 6 months of age either a control formula (n=64) or an MFGM-supplemented formula (n=71). A breastfed <b>reference</b> <b>group</b> (n=70) was also included. Cognitive assessment done using the BSID-III at 12 months of age showed that the MFGM-fed infants exhibited significantly higher mean cognitive scores than the control group (105.8 vs 101.8; P<0.008), and not significantly different from the breastfed <b>reference</b> <b>group.</b> In contrast, {{there were no significant differences}} in motor domain scores between the three groups, and both experimental and control formula groups scored lower than the <b>reference</b> <b>group</b> in the verbal domain.|$|E

5|$|The {{previously}} described study by Timby et al. (2015) also assessed {{the effects of}} MFGM supplementation in term infants on the risk of infectious diseases and other disease symptoms. In particular, the cumulative incidence of acute otitis media was analyzed between the two randomized feeding groups (control formula or MFGM- supplemented formula to 6 months of age), and compared to a breastfed <b>reference</b> <b>group.</b> The MFGM-supplemented group experienced {{a significant reduction in}} episodes of acute otitis media up to 6 months of age compared with infants fed control formula (1% vs 9%; P=0.034); with no significant difference in otitis media incidence compared to the breastfed group (0%). In addition, a significantly lower incidence and longitudinal prevalence of antipyretic drug use was seen in the MFGM-supplemented group (25%) compared with the control formula group (43%). Timby et al. (2017) further showed that the MFGM supplementation influenced the infants’ oral microbiota; the authors noted that, Moraxella catarrhalis, a common bacterial cause of acute otitis media, was less prevalent in infants fed the MFGM-supplemented formula than in those fed control formula.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{reference}} range limits as estimated {{in this way}} have higher variance, and therefore less reliability, than those estimated by an arithmetic or log-normal distribution (when such is applicable), because the latter ones acquire statistical power from the measurements of the whole <b>reference</b> <b>group</b> rather than just the measurements at the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles.

40|$|The {{article is}} focused on {{studying}} of how modern Ukrainian migrants in the USA position themselves within the <b>reference</b> <b>groups</b> related to Ukrainian society {{and people who are}} living in Ukraine. Studying the <b>reference</b> <b>groups</b> is one of the approaches that can help determine the features and degree of migrants’ social adaptation in a new place and the directions of their social mobility. The nature of the connection between Ukrainian migrants and their <b>reference</b> <b>groups</b> at home, the reasons for the occurrence or loss of relations and the role it plays in the social advancement of Ukrainians in American society have been found out during the research. Since the study is based on the theory of transnationalism, the status of Ukrainian society <b>reference</b> <b>groups</b> has been analyzed in relation to other types of migrant’s <b>reference</b> <b>groups,</b> for example, local ethnic and American. 31 semi-structured interviews with first-generation Ukrainian migrants residing in the USA have been used as an empirical basis for analysis. The survey was conducted in 2015 and aimed to study social and ethnic identities and practices of Ukrainian migrants in the United States. The main outcomes of the research are as follows. Speaking of first-generation migrants it has been noted that their identification with people living in Ukraine has undergone a multi-directional transformation. In some cases, the former social-ethnic identification was weakened or completely lost, while in others it was reinforced or even arose for the first time. A relationship has been found between the type of identification with the <b>reference</b> <b>groups,</b> as well as the way of their use, on the one hand, and the degree of social adaptation of migrants, on the other. As a result, several trends have been identified. First, the situation of dynamic social progress due to the reliance on identification associated with the <b>reference</b> <b>groups</b> in Ukraine at the stage of initial adaptation. Second, the tendency towards disintegration with American society and narrowing the chances of social mobility, due to the closure of the social-cultural patterns of Ukrainian society in the later stages of social adaptation. Third, the situation of simultaneous social advancement and maintaining close ties with <b>reference</b> <b>groups</b> in Ukraine due to acquiring a social status, confirmed by active participation in civil initiatives in Ukraine or Ukrainian-American projects. Fourth, the expansion of social opportunities for migrants, due to the integration of Ukrainian <b>reference</b> <b>groups</b> into a system of new ones, connected with American society...|$|R
