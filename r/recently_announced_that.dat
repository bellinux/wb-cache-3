25|$|Retailers {{must also}} plan for {{customer}} preferred payment modes– e.g., cash, credit, lay-by, Electronic Funds Transfer at Point-of-Sale (EFTPOS).

If lay-by is offered, then the retailer will need {{to take into account the}} storage and handling requirements. If cash is the dominant mode of payment, the retailer will need to consider small change requirements, the number of cash floats required, wages costs associated with handling large volumes of cash and the provision of secure storage for change floats. Large retailers, handling significant volumes of cash, may need to hire security service firms to carry the day's takings and deliver supplies of small change.

When it was announced that foreign workers would no longer be issued permits for work in Canada's sex industry, Tim Lambrinos, leader of the Adult Entertainment Association of Canada, said that he might challenge the policy because he believed that [...] "strip clubs are a very safe environment" [...] and that the government was [...] "destroying an industry [...] creating a labour shortage." [...] At Toronto's third annual Walk for Freedom in September 2012, Shae Invidiata criticized the NAP-CHT for allotting only $500,000 to victim services, saying, [...] "I'm very grateful, but we need more." [...] Smith also said that the $500,000 allotted to support victims was insufficient. She said that many of these organizations [...] "still struggle to provide basic care for victims of human trafficking" [...] and {{that there should be a}} [...] "considerable increase in support from the federal and provincial governments for these organizations." ...|$|E

International Speedway Corporation (ISC) officially took ownership of Phoenix Raceway from Emmett [...] "Buddy" [...] Jobe in April 1997. Racing at Phoenix Raceway began to dramatically change in 2003. Turn 2 was reconstructed by pushing back the outside wall to make racing safer.

Previously, vehicles had to use crossover gates and pedestrians used a crossover bridge. In 2004, NASCAR announced it would give a second annual race weekend to Phoenix Raceway starting with the 2005 season. Following the announcement, the track installed lights to allow the newly scheduled NASCAR race to be run in the evening.
