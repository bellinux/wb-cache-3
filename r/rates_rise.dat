5|$|PD is {{the second}} most common {{neurodegenerative}} disorder after Alzheimer's disease and affects approximately seven million people globally and one million people in the United States. The proportion in a population at a given time is about 0.3% in industrialized countries. PD is more common in the elderly and <b>rates</b> <b>rise</b> from 1% in those over 60 years of age to 4% of the population over 80. The mean age of onset is around 60 years, although 5–10% of cases, classified as young onset PD, begin between the ages of 20 and 50. PD may be less prevalent in those of African and Asian ancestry, although this finding is disputed. Some studies have proposed that it is more common in men than women, but others failed to detect any differences between the two sexes. The number of new cases per year of PD is between 8 and 18 per 100,000 person–years.|$|E
5|$|Clock shifts {{were found}} to {{increase}} the risk of heart attack by 10 percent, and to disrupt sleep and reduce its efficiency. Effects on seasonal adaptation of the circadian rhythm can be severe and last for weeks. A 2008 study found that although male suicide <b>rates</b> <b>rise</b> in the weeks after the spring transition, the relationship weakened greatly after adjusting for season. A 2008 Swedish study found that heart attacks were significantly more common the first three weekdays after the spring transition, and significantly less common the first weekday after the autumn transition. A 2013 review found little evidence that people slept more on the night after the fall DST shift, even though it is often described as allowing people to sleep for an hour longer than normal. The same review stated that the lost hour of sleep resulting from the spring shift appears to result in sleep loss for at least a week afterward. In 2015, two psychologists recommended that DST be abolished, citing its disruptive effects on sleep as one reason for this recommendation.|$|E

25|$|As of January 2012, {{public debt}} owned by foreigners has {{increased}} to approximately 50% {{of the total}} or approximately $5.0 trillion.

25|$|The {{market price}} of a bond is {{the present value of}} all {{expected}} future interest and principal payments of the bond discounted at the bond's yield to maturity, or rate of return.

Consistent with similar studies, banks behave asymmetrically in response to changes in the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) target interest <b>rate.</b> <b>Rate</b> <b>rises</b> are passed onto the consumer faster than rate cuts and the credit card interest rate showed a very significant degree of downward rigidity.

However, in absolute terms the short-run effects of rate cuts were not only less than half of the <b>rate</b> <b>rises</b> but also were delayed on average by three months...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{measures}} {{the full extent}} of downward stickiness in credit card interest rates by testing for the amount and adjustment asymmetries. We found that lenders behave asymmetrically in response to changes in the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) cash rate. The RBA’s <b>rate</b> <b>rises</b> are passed on to borrowers much faster than rate cuts and the aggregate credit card interest rate showed a very resilient degree of downward rigidity. Overall, based on the estimated short-run dynamic model, banks immediately pass on 112 % of any RBA’s <b>rate</b> <b>rises,</b> but only 53. 7 % of any rate cut. In other words, the short-run effects of rate cuts were not only {{less than half of the}} <b>rate</b> <b>rises</b> but also were delayed on average by two months. As far as changes in the credit card interest rate are concerned, an expansionary monetary policy is thus less effective than a contractionary policy...|$|R

The most adverse effects of these hiring policies have occurred in the most heavily black populated cities. There is no consistent evidence that crime <b>rates</b> <b>rise</b> when standards for hiring women are changed, and this raises questions about whether norming tests or altering their content to create equal pass rates is preferable. The paper examines how the changing composition of police departments affects such measures as the murder of and assaults against police officers.|$|E
25|$|CBO {{reported}} that net {{interest on the}} public debt was approximately $240 billion in FY2016 (6% of spending), an increase of $17 billion or 8% versus FY2015. A higher level of debt coincided with higher interest rates. During FY2012, the GAO reported a figure of $245 billion, down from $251 billion. Government also accrued a non-cash interest expense of $187 billion for intra-governmental debt, primarily the Social Security Trust Fund, for a total interest expense of $432 billion. GAO {{reported that}} even though the national debt rose in FY2012, the interest rate paid declined. Should interest <b>rates</b> <b>rise</b> to historical averages, the interest cost would increase dramatically.|$|E

Protections against interest rate rises include (a) a possible initial period with a fixed rate (which gives the borrower a chance to increase his/her annual earnings before payments rise); (b) a maximum (cap) that interest rates can rise in any year (if there is a cap, it must be specified in the loan document); and (c) a maximum (cap) that interest rates can rise {{over the life of}} the mortgage (this also must be specified in the loan document).|$|E

The latest average relative <b>rate</b> of <b>rise</b> of worldwide sea levels from a compilation of 170 stations with more than 60 years of data returns an average relative <b>rate</b> of <b>rise</b> + 0. 25 mm/year.

25|$|Fixed rate {{bonds are}} subject to {{interest}} rate risk, meaning that their market prices will decrease in value when the generally prevailing interest <b>rates</b> <b>rise.</b> Since the payments are fixed, {{a decrease in the}} market price of the bond means an increase in its yield. When the market interest rate rises, the market price of bonds will fall, reflecting investors' ability to get a higher interest rate on their money elsewhere — perhaps by purchasing a newly issued bond that already features the newly higher interest rate. This does not affect the interest payments to the bondholder, so long-term investors who want a specific amount at the maturity date do not need to worry about price swings in their bonds and do not suffer from interest rate risk.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{destruction}} of the rainforest has occurred through slash and burn farming, which allows for little to no fallow time and creates soil erosion. It also depletes what little nutrition there is in the soil, which is then also polluted by the use of fertilizers and pesticides. As of {{the first decade of the}} 21st century, it is estimated about two thirds of the Lacandon outside the main biosphere reserve has been converted into pasture or cropland. Once this land has been cleared and used, it is very difficult to revert it to rainforest, even after it has been abandoned. Grass for pasture is particularly problematic because after it takes hold, does not allow natural vegetation to compete with it. In addition, the soil becomes compacted by the trampling of livestock. This degradation causes streams to dry up as evaporation <b>rates</b> <b>rise</b> from the lack of shade.|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} accepted {{that the price}} of gold is closely related to interest rates. As interest <b>rates</b> <b>rise,</b> the general tendency is for the gold price, which earns no interest, to fall, and vice versa. As a result, the gold price can be closely correlated to central banks via their monetary policy decisions on interest rates. For example, if market signals indicate the possibility of prolonged inflation, central banks may decide to raise interest rates, which could reduce the price of gold. But this does not always happen: after the European Central Bank raised its interest rate slightly on April 7, 2011, {{for the first time since}} 2008, the price of gold drove higher, and hit a new high one day later. Similarly, in August 2011 when interest rates in India were at their highest in two years, the gold prices peaked as well.|$|E

500|$|Important {{risk factors}} for penile cancer include {{phimosis}} and HPV infection, {{both of which are}} mitigated by circumcision. [...] The mitigating effect circumcision has on the risk factor introduced by the possibility of phimosis is secondary, in that the removal of the foreskin eliminates the possibility of phimosis. [...] This can be inferred from study results that show uncircumcised men with no history of phimosis are equally likely to have penile cancer as circumcised men. [...] Circumcision is also associated with a reduced prevalence of cancer-causing types of HPV in men and a reduced risk of cervical cancer (which is caused by a type of HPV) in female partners of men. [...] As penile cancer is rare (and may become increasingly rare as HPV vaccination <b>rates</b> <b>rise),</b> and circumcision has risks, the practice is not considered to be valuable solely as a prophylactic measure against penile cancer in the United States.|$|E

Hancock is jeered by other drivers for causing more damage but Ray steps in and publicly thanks Hancock for saving his life. Ray invites him home for dinner with his wife, Mary ( [...] Charlize Theron), and their son, Aaron, during which Ray offers to improve Hancock's public image.
