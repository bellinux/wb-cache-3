50|$|ACARM-ng's daemon allows {{addition}} {{and removal}} of new plug-ins {{without the need}} to <b>recompile</b> the core package. It makes system development and testing much easier.|$|E
5000|$|Speed Doubler: Software that {{combined}} an enhanced disk cache, better Finder copy utility, and a dynamically <b>recompiling</b> 68K-to-PowerPC emulator, which was faster than both the interpretive emulator that shipped {{in the original}} PowerPCs and the dynamically <b>recompiling</b> emulator that Apple shipped in later machines. It was made obsolete as 68K applications became less common and OS code improved.|$|R
25|$|On demand {{capability}} versus {{spending time}} <b>recompiling</b> a whole kernel {{for things like}} new drivers or subsystems.|$|R
50|$|For easy {{cross-platform}} compiling, FBReader uses zlibrary, a cross-platform interface library. It allows <b>recompiling</b> {{for many}} platforms while disregarding the GUI-toolkit used.|$|R
5000|$|PHP4Delphi {{allows you}} to embed the PHP {{interpreter}} into your Delphi application so you can extend and customize the application without having to <b>recompile</b> it.|$|E

50|$|The most {{important}} run-time debugging feature was {{the ability to}} change the code on the fly while debugging. This allowed for bugs to be fixed while debugging without the need to <b>recompile.</b>|$|E
50|$|The engine {{also had}} the ability to <b>recompile</b> {{collections}} of part hierarchies into single composite parts on the fly, which was how the game was able to keep so much animation on the screen.|$|E
5000|$|The content {{managed by}} a CMS {{can usually be}} changed at any time through a web interface. Since Nanoc must <b>recompile</b> the website at every change, it is more {{difficult}} to modify a website.|$|E
50|$|This feature {{appeared}} in 4.4BSD. It {{has the advantage}} over hardcoded constants that changes to the parameters can be made dynamically without <b>recompiling</b> the kernel.|$|R

50|$|Pin {{performs}} instrumentation {{by taking}} control of the program just after it loads into the memory. Then just-in-time <b>recompiles</b> (JIT) small sections of the binary code using pin just before it is run. New instructions to perform analysis are added to the <b>recompiled</b> code. These new instructions come from the Pintool. A large array of optimization techniques are used to obtain the lowest possible running time and memory use overhead. As of June 2010, Pin's average base overhead is 30 percent (without running a pintool).|$|R
50|$|Since {{the source}} code file is already updated, touch {{can be used}} to {{simulate}} a file update, so make will run and <b>recompile</b> the software. $ touch project.c $ makeThen make will rebuild the project.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Recompile</b> JSP when {{included}} page changes - Pages can {{be inserted}} and included into a JSP at runtime. The JSP {{will not only}} be recompiled with JSP file changes but also with included page changes.|$|E
50|$|Electron Mike, {{an extreme}} technophile who listens to techno and {{collects}} iPods. Has a hate/hate relationship with Red Robot, and would rather <b>recompile</b> his Linux kernel than introduce effort into anything non-electronic. Introduced in strip #558.|$|E
50|$|Most often, the {{makefile}} directs make on how {{to compile}} and link a program. Using C/C++ as an example, when a C/C++ source file is changed, it must be <b>recompiled.</b> If a header file has changed, each C/C++ source file that includes the header file must be <b>recompiled</b> to be safe. Each compilation produces an object file corresponding to the source file. Finally, if any source file has been <b>recompiled,</b> all the object files, whether newly made or saved from previous compilations, must be linked together to produce the new executable program. These instructions with their dependencies are specified in a makefile. If none of the files that are prerequisites have been changed {{since the last time}} the program was compiled, no actions take place. For large software projects, using Makefiles can substantially reduce build times if only a few source files have changed.|$|R
50|$|This {{conversion}} {{is implemented}} in VFormat plugin. Format descriptions are in XML format, allowing more frequent updates to those without modifying and <b>recompiling</b> the actual program code.|$|R
