5000|$|The scalars and vectors {{have their}} usual interpretation, {{and make up}} {{distinct}} subspaces of a GA. Bivectors provide a more natural representation of pseudovector quantities in vector algebra such as oriented area, oriented angle of <b>rotation,</b> <b>torque,</b> angular momentum, electromagnetic field and the Poynting vector. A trivector can represent an oriented volume, and so on. An element called a blade {{may be used to}} represent a subspace of [...] and orthogonal projections onto that subspace. Rotations and reflections are represented as elements. Unlike vector algebra, a GA naturally accommodates any number of dimensions and any quadratic form such as in relativity. However, a direct representation within the algebra has not been found for all physical and geometric operations, including general linear transforms of , which are represented as a class of linear function named outermorphisms, as well as other quantities such as the stress-energy tensor or Ricci curvature, in contrast with the more universal tensor algebra.|$|E

40|$|The {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) provides resistance to tibial internal <b>rotation</b> <b>torque</b> and anterior shear at the knee. ACL deficiency results in knee instability. Optimisation of muscle contraction through functional electrical stimulation (FES) offers the prospect of mitigating the destabilising effects of ACL deficiency. The hypothesis {{of this study is}} that activation of the biceps femoris long head (BFLH) reduces the tibial internal <b>rotation</b> <b>torque</b> and the anterior shear force at the knee. Gait data of twelve healthy subjects were measured with and without the application of FES and taken as inputs to a computational musculoskeletal model. The model was used to investigate the optimum levels of BFLH activation during FES gait in reducing the anterior shear force to zero. This study found that FES significantly reduced the tibial internal <b>rotation</b> <b>torque</b> at the knee during the stance phase of gait (p = 0. 0322) and the computational musculoskeletal modelling revealed that a mean BFLH activation of 20. 8 % (± 8. 4 %) could reduce the anterior shear force to zero. At the time frame when the anterior shear force was zero, the internal <b>rotation</b> <b>torque</b> was reduced by 0. 023 ± 0. 0167 Nm/BW, with a mean 188 % reduction across subjects (p = 0. 0002). In conclusion, activation of the BFLH is able to reduce the tibial internal <b>rotation</b> <b>torque</b> and the anterior shear force at the knee in healthy control subjects. This should be tested on ACL deficient subject to consider its effect in mitigating instability due to ligament deficiency. In future clinical practice, activating the BFLH may be used to protect ACL reconstructions during post-operative rehabilitation, assist with residual instabilities post reconstruction, and reduce the need for ACL reconstruction surgery in some cases...|$|E

40|$|Background: There {{is limited}} {{information}} regarding load {{responses of the}} posterior oblique and superficial medial collateral lig-aments to applied loads. Hypotheses: The degree of knee flexion affects loads experienced by the posterior oblique ligament and both divisions of the superficial medial collateral ligament. The posterior oblique ligament provides significant resistance to valgus and internal rota-tion forces near knee extension. Different load responses are experienced by proximal and distal divisions of the superficial medial collateral ligament. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Twenty-four nonpaired, fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were tested. Buckle transducers were applied to the proximal and distal divisions of the superficial medial collateral and posterior oblique ligaments. Applied loads at 0 °, 20 °, 30 °, 60 °, and 90 ° of knee flexion consisted of 10 N. m valgus loads, 5 N. m internal and external <b>rotation</b> <b>torques,</b> and 88 N anterior and pos-terior drawer loads. Results: External <b>rotation</b> <b>torques</b> produced a significantly higher load response on the distal superficial medial collateral liga-ment than did internal <b>rotation</b> <b>torques</b> at all flexion angles with the largest difference at 90 ° (96. 6 vs 22. 5 N). For an applied val-gus load at 60 ° of knee flexion, loads on the superficial medial collateral ligament were significantly higher in the distal division (103. 5 N) than the proximal division (71. 9 N).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the {{function}} of torques exerted by the joints of the lower trunk during maximal velocity sprinting. Eight male track and field athletes volunteered, and sprinted 60 m from a standing start position. The ground reaction force of the support leg was determined using a force platform (1000 Hz), which was placed at the 50 -m mark from the start position. Simultaneously, 3 D coordinates were recorded with a motion analysis system (250 Hz) using 20 cameras (MX-T 20). The joint torques were calculated using inverse dynamics. The contribution of joint torques to the right and left hip joint forces, and the torso joint force, was calculated by a method that simultaneously solves equations of motion for each segment and equations of constraint conditions for adjacent segments connected by a joint. The main results were as follows: (1) During the terminal support phase (80 - 100 % normalized time), the angular velocity of anterior rotation of the pelvis decreased and participants in whom this angular velocity decrease was diminished ran faster (p< 0. 10). (2) During terminal support, the hip joint adduction torque of the support leg and the anterior <b>rotation</b> <b>torque</b> of the torso joint rotated the pelvis forward. The moment of the right and left hip joint forces rotated the pelvis backward. (3) During terminal support, the hip joint force of the support leg was generated by its hip joint flexion and adduction torque, the hip joint extension torque of the recovery leg, and the anterior <b>rotation</b> <b>torque</b> of the torso joint. In contrast, the hip joint force of the recovery leg was generated by the hip joint flexion and adduction torque of the support leg, and the anterior <b>rotation</b> <b>torque</b> of the torso joint. (4) During terminal support, the hip joint flexion torque exerted by the support leg rotated the pelvis backward. The hip joint adduction torque of the support leg and the anterior <b>rotation</b> <b>torque</b> of the torso joint rotated the pelvis forward. Previous studies showed that the hip flexion torque drives the leg forward from the hip joint extension position.

40|$|Specific {{injuries}} at {{the elbow}} and glenohumeral joints {{have been linked to}} several kinetic variables that occur throughout the throwing motion. Ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) sprains have been linked to excessive elbow valgus and shoulder external rotation torques occurring during the late-cocking phase of throwing. Shoulder external <b>rotation</b> <b>torque</b> during the late arm-cocking phase and shoulder distraction forces during the deceleration phase contribute to tears of the labrum. Additionally, it is believed that the peak distraction force generated during the arm deceleration phase also contributes to SLAP tears and rotator cuff pathologies. Very little research has been done to directly examine the relationship between pitch velocity and the kinetic variables that contribute to injuries {{at the elbow}} and shoulder. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to examine the correlation of pitch velocity with elbow valgus torque, shoulder external <b>rotation</b> <b>torque,</b> and shoulder distraction force in a group of NCAA Division I collegiate baseball pitchers. Sixty-seven NCAA Division I college baseball pitchers were analyzed using highspeed motion analysis. Eight electronically synchronized high-speed (240 Hz) digital cameras tracked the movement of reflective markers placed over 26 anatomical landmarks on each participant in order to calculate the values of the kinetic variables examined. After warming up, participants threw fastballs off an indoor pitching mound towards a strike zone target. The average of the 3 highest velocity fastballs thrown for strikes was used for data analysis. The relationship between pitch velocity and peak elbow valgus torque, shoulder distraction force, and shoulder external <b>rotation</b> <b>torque</b> was analyzed using a Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s correlation coefficient.

Twenty-four healthy young men performed isokinetic axial rotation in {{right and left}} directions at 30, 60, and 120 degrees per second angular velocity. Simultaneously, surface EMG was recorded on external oblique (EO), internal oblique (IO), and latissimus dorsi (LD) bilaterally. Results. In each direction, {{with the increase of}} angular velocity, peak torque decreased, whereas peak power increased. During isokinetic axial rotation, contralateral EO as well as ipsilateral IO and LD acted as primary agonists, whereas, ipsilateral EO as well as contralateral IO and LD acted as primary antagonistic muscles. For each primary agonist, the root mean square values decreased with the increase of angular velocity. Antagonist coactiviation was observed at each velocity; however, it appears to be higher with the increase of angular velocity. Conclusion. Our results suggest that velocity of rotation has great impact on the axial <b>rotation</b> <b>torque</b> and EMG activity. An inverse relationship of angular velocity was suggested with the axial <b>rotation</b> <b>torque</b> as well as root mean square value of individual trunk muscle.

40|$|Abnormal foot {{function}} {{has been}} associated with an increased rate of injury in the athletic population. It has been shown that high-arched (HA) and low-arched (LA) athletes experience different injury patterns. These may be the manifestation of different loading and joint torque patterns in HA and LA athletes. It has been shown that HA and LA athletes have unique kinematic and kinetic patterns during running. However, little research has examined ground reaction forces (GRF) and lower extremity joint kinetics in HA and LA athletes during landing tasks. PURPOSE: To examine GRF and knee and ankle joint torques in HA and LA athletes during a landing task. METHODS: Ten HA (age: 20. 8 ± 2. 5 years; height: 1. 62 ± 0. 07 m; mass: 58. 3 ± 5. 4 kg; arch index: 0. 386 ± 0. 010) and 10 LA (age: 21. 1 ± 2. 3; height: 1. 63 ± 0. 07 m; mass: 58. 9 ± 10. 9 kg; arch index: 0. 259 ± 0. 043) female recreational athletes participated in this study. Each subject performed five barefooted drop landing trials from a height of 30 cm. GRFs and three-dimensional (3 D) kinematics were recorded simultaneously using a force plate (1200 Hz, AMTI) and 7 -camera motion analysis system (240 Hz, Vicon). GRFs and joint torques were calculated using Visual 3 D (C-Motion, Inc.) and critical events were determined using custom software. A one-way ANOVA was used to compare group differences with an alpha level of p 3 ̆c 0. 05. RESULTS: The GRF profiles were similar between the HA and LA athletes. However, HA athletes exhibited a mean eversion moment compared to an inversion moment in LA athletes (HA: - 0. 05 ± 0. 08 Nm/kg; LA: 0. 04 ± 0. 07 Nm/kg). Additionally, the HA athletes generated greater peak knee external <b>rotation</b> <b>torques</b> (HA: 0. 18 ± 0. 06 Nm/kg; LA: 0. 26 ± 0. 08 Nm/kg) compared to LA athletes during the landing task. Knee extension and abduction torques were similar between the two groups in contrast to previous findings. CONCLUSIONS: The greater mean eversion torques exhibited by the HA athletes may be a response to being more inverted throughout the landing task. Increased eccentric contraction of the ankle everters would control eversion during landing. Similarly, the increased knee external <b>rotation</b> <b>torques</b> would act to limit knee internal rotation during landing.
