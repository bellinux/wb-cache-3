All land titles must be registered, but there is no accurate information as to the extent of registration. Real estate could only be owned by Saudi citizens until 2000, when the property laws were amended to allow foreigners to own property in Saudi Arabia.

5|$|Henry Chadwick is {{generally}} {{credited with the}} invention of scorekeeping in baseball. Chadwick was also {{the inventor of the}} modern box score and the writer of the first rule book for the game of baseball. Since baseball statistics were initially a subject of interest to sportswriters, the role of the official scorer in Major League Baseball (MLB) {{in the early days of}} the sport was performed by newspaper writers. A judgment call that is required by the official scorer does not alter the outcome of a game, but these judgments impact the statistical records of the game. As the subjective scoring decisions which are used to calculate baseball statistics began to be used to determine the relative value of baseball players, MLB began to <b>require</b> <b>approval</b> from the league before a writer-scorer could be assigned to produce the scoring report for a game. By the 1970s, writers who were willing to score games for MLB were required to have attended 100 or more games per year in the prior three years and to be chosen by the local chapter chairman of the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). Qualified candidates for scoring were submitted to the leagues for approval.|$|E

25|$|The draft faced staunch {{opposition}} by royalist {{members of}} the convention, led by Kasem Chatikavanich. A new draft was demanded, granting the monarch greater power and increasing royal powers to the level granted by the 1949 constitution. The monarch would appoint a Senate with the countersign of the privy council president. The royal veto could be overridden only with a two-thirds majority of the combined parliament. Furthermore, the Senate could kill any laws by not voting on them for six months. Civil servants and soldiers could not become MPs, but could form {{up to half of}} the cabinet. The new draft would not <b>require</b> <b>approval</b> by a public referendum.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, {{four new}} bills were {{introduced}} in the National Assembly in Saint Kitts, one of which made provisions to have revenue derived from activities in Nevis paid directly to the treasury in Saint Kitts instead of to the treasury in Nevis. Another bill, The Financial Services Committee Act, contained provisions that all investments in Saint Kitts and Nevis would <b>require</b> <b>approval</b> by an investment committee in Saint Kitts. This was controversial, because ever since 1983 the Nevis Island Administration had approved all investments for Nevis, {{on the basis that}} the constitution vests legislative authority for industries, trades and businesses and economic development in Nevis to the Nevis Island Administration.|$|E
25|$|Voting {{power in}} the IMF {{is based on a}} quota system. Each member has a number of basic votes (each member's number of basic votes equals 5.502% of the total votes), plus one {{additional}} vote for each Special Drawing Right (SDR) of 100,000 of a member country's quota. The Special Drawing Right is the unit of account of the IMF and represents a claim to currency. It is based on a basket of key international currencies. The basic votes generate a slight bias in favour of small countries, but the additional votes determined by SDR outweigh this bias. Changes in the voting shares <b>require</b> <b>approval</b> by a supermajority of 85% of voting power.|$|E

Provincial WSCs have evolved from a centralized national water supply organization during the 1990s. Their autonomy is still limited.

Assets are owned by the province, not the WSC. There is no contractual relationship between the Province and the WSC. Some WSCs are Public Service Enterprises (PSEs), while others have converted to private-law enterprises {{on the basis of}} the Enterprise Law. Some WSCs only operate the water systems, while others also design or even build them. Some even manufacture equipment. Some WSC are active outside their geographical jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|The drum major’s uniform {{has gone}} through countless changes since “Tubby” Essington’s uniform {{in the early days}} of the band. Every drum major uniform of the band is custom-tailored. Shortly after drum major tryouts in the spring, the Fruhauf Uniform company sends a {{representative}} to take exact measurements of the drum major and assistant drum major. At this point, the drum major is free to take artistic license on the style of their uniform. They can choose to model their uniform on a style consistent since the 1950s, with minor changes or they may choose to make more striking changes, which <b>require</b> <b>approval</b> of the directing staff. Most drum majors only choose small modifications, such as wearing of tassels on the tall fur hat or the set up of any cords worn adorning the hat. The modern drum major uniform, chosen by most drum majors without significant altering, has its roots in the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|On May 20, 2004, Chen {{was sworn}} in for his second term as President amid {{continued}} mass protests by the pan-blue alliance over the validity of his re-election. Having heard protests from pro-independence figures in Taiwan, he did not explicitly re-state the Four Noes and One Without but did state that he reaffirmed the commitments made in his first inaugural. He defended his proposals to change the constitution, but asked for constitutional reform to be undertaken through existing procedures instead of calling for a referendum for an entirely new constitution which was proposed by former president Lee Teng-hui. This would <b>require</b> <b>approval</b> by a three-fourths majority of the National Assembly which could authorize a referendum. This has two major implications. First, by going through existing constitutional amendment procedures, this has the symbolic effect of maintaining continuity with the existing constitution which was originally written in China. Second, this has the practical effect of requiring the Chen administration to get {{the consent of the}} opposition Pan-Blue coalition to pass any amendments, and while the opposition is willing to consider constitutional reforms that would increase governmental efficiency, they are unlikely to support anything that would imply a de jure declaration of independence.|$|E
