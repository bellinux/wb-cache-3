In Neath itself, a masterplan for the Canal Green area, developing both the <b>river</b> <b>frontage</b> and canal sides, {{has the potential to}} provide a canal basin and moorings for Neath.|$|E
5|$|A {{large area}} of the grounds between the asylum main {{buildings}} and Princess Street was allocated to Children's Cottages in 1885. When the Children's Cottages became a separate institution, the area surrounding the cottages became no longer under asylum management and was no longer for asylum inmate use. Widening and straightening of Princess Street in 1939-1940 resulted in the demolishing of Kew's gatehouses, loss of land and the relocation of the main gates to Victoria Park, Kew. Construction of Yarra Boulevard during the 1930s led to {{a section of the}} asylum's <b>river</b> <b>frontage</b> being acquired by the roads department.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>river</b> <b>frontage</b> {{areas of}} Alabama and Mississippi were settled by {{planters}} {{who developed the}} cotton plantation economy {{with the use of}} slave labor, Mobile's population exploded. It came to be settled by attorneys, cotton factors, doctors, merchants and other professionals seeking to capitalize on trade with the upriver areas. Mobile was well situated for trade, as its location tied it to a river system that served as the principal navigational access for most of Alabama and a large part of Mississippi. By 1822 the city's population was 2800.|$|E

5|$|In June 1838 Barry {{and colleagues}} {{undertook}} {{a tour of}} Britain to locate a supply of stone for the building, eventually choosing Magnesian Limestone from the Anston quarry of the Duke of Leeds. Work started on building the <b>river</b> <b>frontage</b> on 1 January 1839, and Barry's wife laid the foundation stone on 27 April 1840. The stone was badly quarried and handled, and with the polluted atmosphere in London {{it proved to be}} problematic, with the first signs of deterioration showing in 1849, and extensive renovations required periodically.|$|E
5|$|The <b>river</b> <b>frontage</b> was {{completed}} in April 1835 {{at a cost of}} £7,100, its completion a condition of King's College London securing the site from the Crown. Unlike those in the school, student numbers in the Senior department remained almost stationary during King's first five years of existence. During this time the medical school was blighted by inefficiency and the divided loyalties of the staff leading to a steady decline in attendance. One of the most important appointments was that of Charles Wheatstone as professor of Experimental Philosophy.|$|E
25|$|During the 2000s a {{building}} comprising seven commercial units was erected opposite {{the western side}} of the hall, with many of the Southbank administrative offices above. Shops and restaurants were added along the <b>river</b> <b>frontage.</b>|$|E

50|$|The E1 {{postcode}} {{district has}} a <b>River</b> Thames <b>frontage</b> {{to the south}} and is central to London. Postcode districts E6, E14 and E16 also have <b>river</b> <b>frontages</b> in the south. The River Roding and the North Circular Road form part of the boundary in the east. The postcode area maps roughly to the combined area of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, London Borough of Newham and London Borough of Waltham Forest. The eastern part of the London Borough of Hackney, western sections of the London Borough of Redbridge (E11, E12, E18) and London Borough of Barking and Dagenham (E6), and {{a small part of the}} Epping Forest district of Essex (E4) are within the postcode area.|$|R
50|$|The {{district}} had {{an extensive}} <b>River</b> Thames <b>frontage,</b> stretching from London Bridge to Shad Thames. It extended inland to cover London Bridge station, {{part of the}} approach tracks, {{and part of the}} site of Guy's Hospital.|$|R
25|$|The MMBW {{commenced}} their Melbourne Metropolitan Planning Scheme in 1949. This scheme involved redeveloping the Yarra <b>River</b> <b>frontage,</b> partially roofing {{the rail}} yards, constructing a bridge from Russell Street to Batman Avenue, and building underpasses below Princes Bridge and Batman Avenue.|$|E
25|$|In Louisiana's colonial era, {{this area}} was {{developed}} as sugar cane plantations, with narrow lots extending back from the <b>river</b> <b>frontage</b> that provided the transportation and shipping routes. At {{the start of the}} 19th century, the portion closer to the river was developed for residential use, {{at the same time as}} the Bywater area.|$|E
25|$|During the 1930s, a {{significant}} amount of land was reclaimed from the river, and the brewery lost its <b>river</b> <b>frontage.</b> Also, between 1936 and 1938, a new brewery building designed by Perth architectural firm Oldham, Boas and Ednie-Brown was constructed on the site. Constructed in the Art Deco style, this new building replaced the old Stanley Brewery building.|$|E

25|$|The 1824 Accounts Relating to the Port of London listed Fresh Wharf {{as having}} a <b>river</b> <b>frontage</b> of , making it the second largest of the Legal Quays after Custom House Quay. All of the Legal Quays, {{including}} Fresh Wharf, were compulsorily purchased {{by the government in}} 1805 but in 1827 the wharfinger John Knill was assigned the lease at a yearly rent of £1,555 after purchasing the fee simple from the Crown.|$|E
25|$|In 1839 Stokes mortgaged {{the brewery}} site {{back to the}} {{original}} owner, Leake, to fund the purchase of the adjacent block. There, he built himself a house; around this time he also bought the small portion of <b>river</b> <b>frontage</b> immediately in front of the brewery from the government for £13/5s/-. In the same year, Stokes also formed a partnership in land and commission agents with Dubois Aggett, however in 1840 Aggett maimed himself while attempting suicide, and Stokes severed the partnership.|$|E
50|$|Upstream of these, only {{a little}} {{commercial}} activity takes place on the river or its banks. Some residences having <b>river</b> <b>frontages</b> use them as moorings for small boats, {{and a number of}} private houseboats are berthed. One more large road bridge, Cobden Bridge, connects St. Denys and Bitterne Park. More houseboats are berthed to the north of it on the Western side, otherwise the riversides are occupied by parkland and the Portswood Sewage Treatment Works for much of the next stretch, as far as Woodmill Bridge. The tidal section of the river, for which the Port of Southampton is the navigation authority, ends here. The river Itchen upstream is noted as one of the world's premier chalk streams for fly fishing.|$|R

50|$|Adams' land {{passed to}} a trustee in March 1846, and in March 1861 {{two of the}} subdivisions (suburban allotments 1 and 2 - {{comprising}} 2 acres 1 rood 33 perches) were conveyed to Sydney businessman Joseph Thompson. Thompson held this and (reputedly) other Kangaroo Point property, {{until his death in}} 1902, but did not reside there. He developed the eastern half of the site, fronting Main Street, with investment houses, including an 1860s duplex Silverwells and Sunnyside (1890s). From mid-1891 Thompson leased the western half of the land, with its <b>river</b> <b>frontages,</b> to the Australasian United Steam Navigation Company (initially held on a 25-year lease). The AUSN Co. established their workshops here and erected a wharf on the riverbank, directly opposite their Mary Street wharf, on the city side of the Brisbane River.|$|R
25|$|A {{large area}} of the <b>river</b> <b>frontage,</b> {{including}} part of Windmillcroft Quay, Springfield Quay, General Terminus Quay, Mavisbank Quay and Princes Dock, was cleared in the early 1980s. Mavisbank Quay and the mostly infilled Princes Dock area was used to host the 1988 Glasgow Garden Festival. The former Glasgow Garden Festival site was relatively quickly redeveloped {{after the end of}} the six month festival; however the General Terminus Quay site was left vacant. It has since been used for housing and nearly all traces of the railway line have been removed between the River Clyde and its passage under the Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway.|$|E
25|$|In 1885, Shadwell Fish Market {{was opened}} as an {{alternative}} to Billingsgate Fish Market. Although Shadwell had the advantage of three times the <b>river</b> <b>frontage</b> of Billingsgate and access via train, the fish market was ultimately unsuccessful. In 1901, it was sold to the City of London Corporation, and was eventually closed in 1914. The site later became King Edward Memorial Park in 1922, when it was opened by King George V, and was Shadwell's first park. From 1868-1932, Shadwell was home to the East London Hospital for Children (later the Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children), before it moved to Wapping, and was later closed down in 1963.|$|E
25|$|Villach – Apart {{from a few}} {{fragments}} of wall, tower and evidence for a moat at the NW corner of the defensive circuit, none of the walls or gates now survive. Merian’s plan of the town in 1649 and the prospect view of 1679 show extensive fortifications.There were six gate towers and a defended bridgehead across the river Drau. The bridgehead was walled with a further gate-tower and a bastion in front. The river Drau curves round Villach, and on the <b>river</b> <b>frontage</b> there was a single wall, but on the western and southern sides there was a secondary wall with a series round towers. In front of this secondary wall there was a wide moat fed by the Drau.|$|E
50|$|The town {{is defined}} by the sea and <b>river</b> <b>frontages</b> (each about a mile long), and {{stretches}} around 2.5 miles (4 km) inland, along a north-easterly axis. The docks lie at the western corner of this rectangle, where the river passes through a narrow passage into the sea, the mouth of the estuary being nearly closed by Dawlish Warren on the opposite shore of the river. Dawlish Warren is a natural sand spit and is home to rare wildlife and plants, part of which is a nature reserve and restricted access. The sea frontage forms a sandy two mile long beach; at its eastern end, the town is limited by the cliffs of the High Land of Orcombe, a National Trust-owned open space which rises to a peak at Orcombe Point.|$|R
5000|$|Major Thomas Mitchell was {{the first}} European to {{discover}} and cross the river in August 1836, noting its width and its suitability for boating, naming it for Colonial Secretary Baron Glenelg, Charles Grant. [...] A cenotaph at Nelson marks the crossing point. The first Europeans arrived in 1840. Thomas Ricketts moved from the Barwon River to the Glenelg and established [...] "Clunie" [...] on its southern boundary. [...] Historians noted the hostility of the Indigenous people of the area who drove Ricketts out of the settlement and conflicted with many others. Addison and Murray from Van Diemen's Land set up the sheep run Dunrobin in January, 1840 after which {{more than half a}} dozen squatters others followed, {{and by the end of}} the year, many properties had <b>river</b> <b>frontages</b> and the population grew gradually thereafter.|$|R
5000|$|When Melbourne's Southbank complex {{opened on}} the Yarra <b>River</b> {{southern}} <b>frontage</b> in September 1992, Robin Best's neon work 'Running Girl' was chosen for temporary installation atop the pedestrian bridge that joins Southbank with Flinders Street Station. The work refers nostalgically to 'Little Audrey', but transforms her into a contemporary adult female jogger.|$|R
25|$|It then {{reaches the}} town of Gainsborough with its own Trent Bridge. The <b>river</b> <b>frontage</b> in the town is lined with warehouses, that were once used when the town was an inland port, {{many of which have}} been renovated for modern use. Downstream of the town the villages are often named in pairs, {{representing}} {{the fact that they were}} once linked by a river ferry between the two settlements. These villages include West Stockwith and East Stockwith, Owston Ferry and East Ferry, and West Butterwick and East Butterwick. At West Stockwith the Trent is joined by the Chesterfield Canal and the River Idle and soon after enters Lincolnshire fully, passing to the west of Scunthorpe. The last bridge over the river is at Keadby where it is joined by both the Stainforth and Keadby Canal and the River Torne.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} part of the Kennedy district in north Queensland, where Wairuna is located, was settled quickly by pastoralists in the early 1860s. By the end of 1861 the best of the country had been selected, including the entire Burdekin <b>River</b> <b>frontage.</b> During this initial rush James Atkinson (1824-1899), in partnership with Ezra Firth, attempted to establish a run on land later claimed {{to be part of the}} early station The Valley of Lagoons. Subsequently, c.1863 Atkinson and Firth formed Mt Surprise station to the north. Their partnership lasted for about seven years before Atkinson took up land in the lower Herbert district, where he established the cattle run and cane farm Farnham near the site of Ingham. Atkinson, the son of a linen manufacturer of Scottish descent, was born in County Armagh, Ireland in 1824. After service in the British army he migrated to Victoria in , spent time on the Ballarat goldfield and farmed in the Port Fairy district. He married Kate Good in 1859. He, his wife and daughter travelled to north Queensland in the early 1860s to take up pastoral land.|$|E
25|$|In 1953 {{the house}} and {{surrounding}} grounds with an exceptional <b>river</b> <b>frontage</b> on the Thames were purchased by the British province of the Polish Congregation of Marian Fathers, in answer to the demand from the post World War II newly settled Polish community, for use as an independent educational establishment known as, Divine Mercy College and as a religious house. The enterprise was in straitened financial circumstances from the start and, as a charitable institution, relied heavily on public support to build the residential accommodation for the pupils and to keep it running. It was intended for boys of Polish descent but accepted local {{children as well as}} those from overseas, e.g. from Ghana. At its peak the school catered for 150 boys of 9 to 19 years of age and offered a rounded education including university entrance exams. An alumnus of the time is Waldemar Januszczak, the prominent British art critic (born 1954). The house was severely damaged by fire in 1973, but was rebuilt with the help of donations from the Polish community in Britain and abroad. The school finally closed in 1986 due to falling rolls of students of Polish origin, and the Marian Fathers converted Fawley Court into a 'Retreat and Conference Centre'.|$|E
50|$|The Conservation Department {{purchased}} {{this property}} in November 1994 primarily {{for use as}} a public fishing access. The area has some of the best remaining riparian habitat in this reach of the Mississippi <b>River.</b> The <b>frontage</b> has good water depth and instream cover that provides excellent bank fishing for catfish, and other big river species.|$|R
2500|$|In late 1829 Charles Sturt {{and his men}} {{passed along}} the Murrumbidgee River on horses and drays. They {{launched}} their whale-boat near the Murrumbidgee-Lachlan junction and continued the journey by boat to the Murray River and eventually to the sea at Lake Alexandrina (before returning by the same route). During the late-1830s stock was regularly overlanded to South Australia via the Lower Murrumbidgee. [...] At the same time stockholders were edging westward along and the Lachlan, Murrumbidgee, Billabong and Murray systems. [...] By 1839 all of the <b>river</b> <b>frontages</b> {{in the vicinity of}} present-day Hay were occupied by squatters. [...] By the mid-1850s pastoral runs in the western Riverina were well-established and prosperous. The nearby Victorian gold-rushes provided an expanding market for stock. The prime fattening country of the Riverina became a sort of holding centre, from where the Victorian market could be supplied as required. [...] One of the popular routes established in the mid-1850s crossed the Murrumbidgee River at Lang’s Crossing-place.|$|R
40|$|The main {{economic}} activity {{of the people of}} Eritrea is agriculture: crop production and livestock herding. Agriculture mainly comprises mixed farming and some commercial concessions. Most agriculture is rain-fed. The main rain-fed crops are sorghum, millet and sesame, and the main irrigated crops are all horticultural crops like bananas, onions and tomatoes and cotton. The major livestock production constraints are disease, water and feed shortages and agricultural expansion especially in the <b>river</b> <b>frontages.</b> The agricultural sector employs eighty percent of the working population, but its production has not managed to cover internal food demand and is forced to cover nearly 50 per cent of its annual cereal requirements through imports-commercial and food assistance. Like most African countries, Eritrea is also a victim of the problem of food insecurity. In good years the country produces only about 60 per cent of its total food needs and in poor years, it produces no more than 2...|$|R
