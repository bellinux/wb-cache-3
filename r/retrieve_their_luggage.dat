25|$|In 1980, {{the airport}} carried 7 million passengers. However, this {{increased}} to nearly 10 million in 1986. This yet again {{led to a}} new terminal to be constructed, which is today's current central terminal building where passengers both enter and exit the airport and also check in and <b>retrieve</b> <b>their</b> <b>luggage.</b> Construction started in mid-1993 and was designed by the Majorcan architect Pere Nicolau Bover. During the construction in 1995, passenger numbers exceeded 15 million. The new terminal finally opened in 1997.|$|E
5000|$|Ella Fitzgerald {{made her}} first tour of Australia in July 1954 for the Australian-based American {{promoter}} Lee Gordon. This {{was the first}} of Gordon's famous [...] "Big Show" [...] promotions and the 'package' tour also included Buddy Rich, Artie Shaw and comedian Jerry Colonna. Although the tour was a big hit with audiences and set a new box office record for Australia, it was marred by an ugly incident of racial discrimination that caused Fitzgerald to miss the first two concerts in Sydney, and Gordon had to arrange two later free concerts to compensate ticket holders. Although the four members of Fitzgerald's entourage - Fitzgerald, her pianist John Lewis, her assistant (and cousin) Georgiana Henry, and manager Norman Granz - all had first-class tickets on their scheduled Pan-American Airlines flight from Honolulu to Sydney, Fitzgerald, Henry and Lewis were ordered to leave the aircraft after they had already boarded and they were even refused permission to re-board the aircraft to <b>retrieve</b> <b>their</b> <b>luggage</b> and clothing, and as a result they were stranded in Honolulu for three days before they could get another flight to Sydney. Although a contemporary Australian press report quoted an Australian Pan-Am spokesperson who denied that the incident was racially based, Fitzgerald, Henry, Lewis and Granz filed a civil suit for racial discrimination against Pan-Am in December 1954 and in a 1970 television interview Fitzgerald confirmed that they had won the suit and received what she described as a [...] "nice settlement".|$|E
5000|$|The Big Show tour {{played at}} the Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane Stadiums to a rapturous reception, {{although}} it was also marred by a racial controversy. A contemporary article in the Melbourne Argus newspaper reported that the first two concerts of the tour in Sydney on 23 and 24 July featured only Artie Shaw and Buddy Rich, because Fitzgerald did not arrive in time for these Sydney shows. Although the Argus report quoted a local spokesperson for Pan-Am, who denied {{that they had been}} refused seats because of a [...] "color bar", that was indeed the cause - and this was confirmed in December 1954, when Fitzgerald, Henry, Lewis, and Granz jointly filed a civil suit against Pan-Am for racial discrimination. As revealed by the original court documents (now in the U.S. Archives) Fitzgerald et al. alleged that Pan-American Airlines officials in Honolulu had ordered the singer and two of her three travelling companions (her assistant and cousin Georgiana Henry and her accompanist John Lewis) to leave the plane, even though they all had first-class tickets, and that they were even refused permission to re-board the aircraft to <b>retrieve</b> <b>their</b> <b>luggage</b> and clothing - although her (white) manager Norman Granz was not similarly treated, thus making it obvious that their treatment was based on their colour. In a 1970 television interview Fitzgerald was asked about the incident and she confirmed that she had successfully sued the airline for racial discrimination and was awarded what she described as [...] "a nice settlement".|$|E
25|$|The luggage {{system can}} handle 19,200 pieces of luggage per hour.

50|$|The Hotel {{is known}} for being {{the site of the}} capture of bank robber John Dillinger in 1934. After a series of bank robberies, the Dillinger Gang arrived in Tucson to hide out. On January 22, 1934, a fire started in the {{basement}} and spread up to the third floor, where the gang resided under aliases. After the desk clerk contacted them through the switchboard the gang escaped by aerial ladders. On the request of the gang, two firemen <b>retrieved</b> <b>their</b> <b>luggage,</b> identifying who they were. After being transferred to a jail in Crown Point, Indiana, Dillinger escaped again and was eventually shot down in Chicago, Illinois.|$|R
500|$|On May 6, 1963, Time {{magazine}} {{celebrated its}} 40th anniversary at the hotel. The event {{was attended by}} some 1500 celebrities, including General Douglas MacArthur, Jean Monnet, Henry Cabot Lodge, Bob Hope, Joe Louis, David O. Selznick, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Edward Kennedy, Henry Ford II, and many others. [...] In 1968, British rock band The Who checked into the hotel, where they encountered difficulties with {{the staff of the}} Waldorf Astoria. Due to the band's reputation for trashing their hotel rooms and rowdy behavior, the Waldorf demanded that they pay cash up front. However, following their gig, the band members were refused access to their hotel rooms, where <b>their</b> <b>luggage</b> was being kept. Tony Fletcher, in his biography on Keith Moon, claims that Moon challenged the staff and blew the door to their room off the hinges with his cherry bombs and <b>retrieved</b> <b>their</b> <b>luggage,</b> which prompted The Who to be shown the door and banned from the hotel for life. However, clearly the ban was later revoked as they performed at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction at Waldorf on January 17, 1990.|$|R
