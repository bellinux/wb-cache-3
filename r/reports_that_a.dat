5|$|According to Gartner Inc., {{the total}} number of Itanium servers (not processors) sold by all vendors in 2007, was about 55,000. (It is unclear whether {{clustered}} servers counted as a single server or not.) This compares with 417,000 RISC servers (spread across all RISC vendors) and 8.4 million x86 servers. IDC <b>reports</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> total of 184,000 Itanium-based systems were sold from 2001 through 2007. For the combined POWER/SPARC/Itanium systems market, IDC reports that POWER captured 42% of revenue and SPARC captured 32%, while Itanium-based system revenue reached 26% {{in the second quarter of}} 2008.|$|E

This report was received incredulously by Valckenier and the council. However, after {{the murder of a}} Balinese sergeant by the Chinese outside the walls, the council decided to take extraordinary measures and reinforce the guard. Two groups of 50 Europeans and some native porters were sent to outposts on the south and east sides of the city, and a plan of attack was formulated.|$|E

The French attack did not eventuate, however, {{and in the end}} the commandos marched all the way to Maison Blanche. Having only been issued with rations for a day, they had to rely on fruit and bread that they obtained by bartering with the locals on the way. Eventually they arrived at the port, where they embarked upon the destroyers HMS Wheatland and Lammerton and in company with a force of US Rangers they set out to capture the airfields at Allerlick and Duzzerville, near Bone.|$|E
5|$|Also in 941, the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters <b>reports</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> {{chieftain}} named Áed Albanach was slain amongst a vast host of Dublin Vikings by {{the invading}} forces of Amargein mac Cináeda, overking of Uí Failge. The fact that Áed bore a Gaelic personal name, died with the Dubliners, and bore an epithet {{referring to a}} Scotsman, could be evidence {{that he was a}} successor of Gebeachan. Further evidence of this may be the record of Mór, a woman attested by the twelfth-century pseudo-historical Caithréim Chellacháin Chaisil, which identifies her as a daughter of a certain Áed mac Echach, and describes her as the daughter of a King of the Hebrides.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{qualified}} for the final by defeating French club Lens in their semi-final. Galatasaray beat English team Leeds United but their matches were marred by violence: two Leeds United fans were stabbed to death before their semi-final first leg at Galatasaray's Ali Sami Yen Stadium in Istanbul on 6 April 2000. The events happened at 22:00 in Istanbul's Taksim Square during a fight between Leeds fans and Galatasaray fans. Leeds fans had been drinking in bars reportedly taunting local people and Turkish police intervened to stop fights breaking out. There were <b>reports</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> Galatasaray fan had run to a telephone to call for support when he saw Leeds fans arriving. Galatasaray fans entered the area shortly afterwards which precipitated a fight between {{the two sets of}} supporters. This led to the two Leeds fans being stabbed.|$|E

Bletcher <b>reports</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> stolen car has been found abandoned, with Helen's blood inside.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the Dartmouth College case (supra), there are other reports of certificates of division that were issued but never decided by the Supreme Court. After the indictment of Jefferson Davis, the President of the Confederacy, for treason, William Wirt Henry <b>reports</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> certificate of division was issued on Davis's motion to dismiss the indictment {{on the grounds that}} he owed no allegiance to the United States after the secession of his state. Reportedly, Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase sided with Davis, while District Judge John Curtiss Underwood sided with the government. No response from the Supreme Court to that certificate is reported, but Davis's bail was eventually absolved, and he was released.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey took up station off Tiger Island 1 October {{and fired}} at targets {{north of the}} DMZ before moving south that {{afternoon}} to engage Viet Cong targets. She accounted for six bunkers, a supply truck and an anti-aircraft site that day; additionally, she helped rescue the crew of a Marine spotting plane forced down at sea by anti-aircraft fire. On 3 October New Jersey fired on targets south of Tiger Island, and on 4 October the battleship fired on a Communist troop concentration and destroyed several bunkers. On the evening of 7 October New Jersey received <b>reports</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> number of waterborne logistics craft were moving south {{near the mouth of}} the Song Giang River. New Jersey responded by closing on the formation, and succeeded in sinking eleven of the craft before they could beach.|$|E

5|$|Promoted {{to acting}} air commodore, Brownell {{returned}} to Australia in August 1941 and was appointed Air Officer Commanding No.1 Training Group in Melbourne. In this position, Brownell commanded approximately thirty establishments located in southern Australia. On 1 January 1943, he was posted as Air Officer Commanding Western Area. Based at RAAF Base Pearce, Brownell's responsibilities involved coordinating training and directing long-range bombing operations. Following intelligence <b>reports</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> Japanese force {{was en route}} to raid Western Australia, the Australian Government ordered a build-up of the defences in the area. In response to this, Brownell organised air defences around Perth and the Exmouth Gulf during March 1944. With the use of Army transports, he also reinforced Cunderdin with supplies and bombs {{for the use of}} the heavy bombers in the area. The attack from the Japanese, however, did not occur. For his service as Air Officer Commanding Western Area, Brownell was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1945 New Years Honours.|$|E
5|$|The Athenians sent 8,000 hoplites, led by Aristides, {{along with}} 600 Plataean exiles {{to join the}} Allied army. The army then marched in Boeotia across the passes of Mount Cithaeron, {{arriving}} near Plataea, and above the Persian position on the Asopus. Under {{the guidance of the}} commanding general, Pausanias, the Greeks took up position opposite the Persian lines but remained on high ground. Knowing that he had little hope of successfully attacking the Greek positions, Mardonius sought to either sow dissension among the Allies or lure them down into the plain. Plutarch <b>reports</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> conspiracy was discovered among some prominent Athenians, who were planning to betray the Allied cause; although this account is not universally accepted, it may indicate Mardonius' attempts of intrigue within the Greek ranks.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} and investigation received widespread media coverage. The {{impact on the}} public was increased by the dramatic effect of an amateur photo taken of the aircraft rolling that was published {{on the front page of}} the Chicago Tribune on the Sunday two days after the crash. There were some early <b>reports</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> collision with a small aircraft had been the cause of the crash. This apparently was the result of the discovery of small-aircraft parts among the wreckage at the crash site. National Transportation Safety Board vice-chairman Elwood T. Driver, in a press briefing, was photographed holding a broken bolt and nut, implying that these parts were a cause of the accident. The small-plane parts were subsequently determined to have been on the ground at the time of the crash, at the former general aviation Ravenswood Airport, a facility that had been out of service for a few years. An owner there had been selling used aircraft parts from a remaining hangar building.|$|E

5|$|To {{ensure the}} safety of the {{merchant}} ships gathering at Macau in the winter of 1797–98, the British commander in the East Indies, Rear-Admiral Peter Rainier, sent a convoy to China escorted by the frigates HMS Sybille and HMS Fox and commanded by Captain Edward Cooke. After completing his mission Cooke decided to investigate the state of readiness of Spanish forces in Manila himself. He was also intrigued by <b>reports</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> ship carrying treasure was due to sail from Manila, which would make a valuable prize. Sailing in Sybille and accompanied by Captain Pulteney Malcolm in Fox, Cooke reached the Spanish capital on 13 January 1798.|$|E
5|$|Al-Azhar {{nevertheless}} {{remained the}} seat of Arabic philology and a place of learning throughout this period. While official classes were discontinued, private lessons were still offered in the mosque. There are <b>reports</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> scholar, possibly al-Baghdadi, taught a number of subjects, such as law and medicine, at al-Azhar. Saladin reportedly paid him a salary of 30 dinars, which was increased to 100 dinars by Saladin's heirs. While the mosque was neglected by Saladin and his heirs, {{the policies of the}} Sunni Ayyubid dynasty would have a lasting impact on al-Azhar. Educational institutions were established by Sunni rulers as a way of combating what they regarded as the heretical teachings of Shi'a Islam. These colleges, ranging in size, focused on teaching Sunni doctrine, had an established and uniform curriculum that included courses outside of purely religious topics, such as rhetorics, math, and science. No such colleges had been established in Egypt by the time of Saladin's conquest. Saladin and the later rulers of the Ayyubid dynasty would build twenty-six colleges in Egypt, among them the Salihiyya Madrasa.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{importance}} of Syracuse, the sources report scant efforts from the Byzantines to aid the city. Ibn al-Athir <b>reports</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> few Byzantine vessels appeared before the city and were defeated without difficulty, but the main Byzantine fleet {{appears to have been}} occupied with ferrying building material for the erection of Emperor Basil I the Macedonian's Nea Ekklesia church in Constantinople. When the fleet eventually sailed, under the command of a certain Adrianos, it was so delayed by contrary winds at Monemvasia that news of the city's fall reached it there. Unchallenged thus in their control of the sea, the Arabs were able to destroy the fortifications (βραχιόλια) protecting the city's two harbours: the incessant bombardment succeeded in collapsing one of the towers of the seaward fortifications, along with the adjoining stretch of walls, forming a breach where the Arabs concentrated their attack. Nevertheless, the patrikios of the city rallied the defenders, and for twenty days they managed to hold the breach against superior numbers, so that the surrounding area was filled with the dead and wounded.|$|E
