5|$|Some {{books such as}} the Yupian or the Meihōki {{were lost}} early in China, because of the {{persecution}} against Buddhism or for other reasons. The titles survived, however, {{because of the large}} volume of books previously imported to Japan, which were then subsequently <b>re-exported</b> to China. Today, some of the oldest extant manuscripts of Chinese books dating to the Tang Dynasty are located in Japan. Few of the early imported manuscripts have survived. Some of those that survived are listed as National Treasures below. Twenty Chinese book National Treasures exist that were created in China and subsequently imported to Japan. Of these, 19 date to the Tang Dynasty and one to the Southern Song. The designated items are of various type: six treasures are manuscripts of the Five Classics of Confucianism and associated commentaries, four are poetry and prose anthologies of Chinese poets, calligraphers and Emperor Huizong of Song, four are dictionaries, five are anecdote collections and one is a music score.|$|E

40|$|The present article {{deals with}} the {{research}} {{of the concept of}} ‘re-export of financial services’ in banking, the examples of its practical expression and influence on economic processes. For theoretical formulation of the ‘re-export of financial services’ concept the author uses the method of inductive evidence to compare the concepts of export and <b>re-export</b> of goods and services, as well as analyzes historical information on the given subject. Special attention is paid to the comparison of ‘re-export of financial services’ with ‘re-export of capital’. The above mentioned research resulted in the author’s derivation of <b>re-export</b> theory. As practical examples of <b>re-export</b> of financial services the author quotes current schemes used by Latvian banks in their work with fast money transfers and with financial instruments trading on global markets. The article is completed by a disclosure and survey of positive and negative aspects of the influence of <b>re-export,</b> including financial services, on both subjects of economics and economy as a whole. <b>re-export,</b> financial services, banking, export, capital <b>re-export...</b>|$|R

25|$|The Revenue Act {{was passed}} in {{conjunction}} with the Indemnity Act of 1767, which was intended to make the tea of the British East India Company more competitive with smuggled Dutch tea. The Indemnity Act repealed taxes on tea imported to England, allowing it to be <b>re-exported</b> more cheaply to the colonies. This tax cut in England would be partially offset by the new Revenue Act taxes on tea in the colonies. The Revenue Act also reaffirmed the legality of writs of assistance, or general search warrants, which gave customs officials broad powers to search houses and businesses for smuggled goods.|$|E

The value of domestic exports continued to decrease while that of re-exportation from Mainland China increased drastically.

25|$|After the British {{established}} Hong Kong as {{a colony}} {{in the aftermath}} of the First Opium War, merchants from other parts of the British Empire, now in Hong Kong, felt the need for a bank to finance the growing trade, through Hong Kong, and sometimes also through Shanghai, between China and British India, and the rest of the British Empire, and also the rest of Europe, of goods, produces and merchandises of all kinds, but especially of opium, cultivated in or transited (<b>re-exported)</b> through the Raj, and to that end, they organised amongst themselves and formed The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank in Hong Kong (March 1865), and in Shanghai a one-month later.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Data {{representing}} transshipment or <b>re-exports</b> {{are almost}} always excluded from analytical portrayals of international trade, yet transshipment is potentially an important phenomenon in understanding a number of economic questions, and is increasing in importance. Rapid technological change {{in areas such as}} containerization and hub-and-spoke routing has promoted the practice of transshipment. While there are significant gaps in the data, the share of <b>re-exports</b> in global exports has undoubtedly increased rapidly, from perhaps 1 in 20 in the mid- 1980 s to perhaps 1 in 6 today. Econometric analysis of U. S. domestic exports and foreign exports (<b>re-exports)</b> over pairs of U. S. ports and destinations suggests that <b>re-exports</b> are significantly more sensitive than domestic exports to factors influencing transaction costs, including distance, containerization, price-fixing liner agreements, and port efficiency and restrictive port policies in the importing country...|$|R

25|$|Cassiterite {{production}} {{peaked at}} 1,000 tonnes in 1990, but was under 700 tonnes in 2000. Recorded coltan production has soared from 147 tonnes in 1999 to 1,300 tonnes in 2001, and coltan was the country's biggest single export earner in 2001. At {{least part of}} the increase in production is because of new mines opening up in Rwanda. However it is true, as has frequently been observed, that the increase is also because of the fraudulent re-export of Congolese coltan. In addition to the well-publicised involvement in this trade of the Rwandan Defence Force (RDF), another important factor in the coltan re-export is that international dealers are under pressure not to buy from the DRC, thus increasing the incentive for DRC coltan to be <b>re-exported</b> as Rwanda's. Rwanda is also alleged to be trading in fraudulently exported gold and diamonds from the DRC.|$|E
25|$|The modern, private {{enterprise}} economy of Belgium has capitalised on its central geographic location, highly developed transport network, and diversified industrial and commercial base. The first country to undergo an industrial revolution {{on the continent}} of Europe in the early 19th century, Belgium developed an excellent transportation infrastructure of ports, canals, railways, and highways to integrate its industry with that of its neighbors. Industry is concentrated mainly in the populous Flanders in the north, around Brussels and in the two biggest Walloon cities, Liège and Charleroi, along the sillon industriel. Belgium imports raw materials and semi-finished goods that are further processed and <b>re-exported.</b> Except for its coal, which is no longer economical to exploit, Belgium has few natural resources other than fertile soils. Nonetheless, most traditional industrial sectors are represented in the economy, including steel, textiles, refining, chemicals, food processing, pharmaceuticals, automobiles, electronics, and machinery fabrication. Despite the heavy industrial component, services account for 74.9% of GDP, while agriculture accounts for only 1% of GDP.|$|E
25|$|Israel {{also took}} {{a series of steps}} to evade the embargo and clandestinely trade with the Arab world. Front {{companies}} in third countries were set up, which imported goods, then <b>re-exported</b> them to Arab countries with false labels and certificates of origin. In other cases, foreign companies would purchase Israeli technology and materials, use them to assemble completed products, and export them to Arab countries while concealing this fact from their customers. Arrangements with American companies were worked out where the American companies would buy goods from Israeli affiliates and export them as American-made goods. Israeli ships were re-flagged as ships of other nations and provided with faked bills of landing so they could directly export goods to the Arab and Muslim world. Greece and Cyprus were particularly popular hubs for smuggling Israeli goods into the Arab world due to their location, multilateral economic connections, large merchant fleets, and Cyprus' corporate and bank secrecy laws.|$|E

25|$|Re Fong Thin Choo (1991), {{involved}} regulation 12(6) of the Customs Regulations 1979, which {{stated that}} the owner of goods or his agent could be required by a customs officer to produce evidence that the goods had been exported or <b>re-exported,</b> and if the goods were not accounted for to the customs officer's satisfaction or {{were found to have}} been illegally re-landed in Singapore, the owner was liable to pay customs duty on them. The High Court held that the goods not having been exported was a precedent fact to the customs officer's power to require the owner to pay customs duty. Therefore, the Court had to decide whether the customs officer's decision was justified by the evidence, and not merely whether there was some evidence on which he could reasonably have reached his decision. However, the Court did not pursue the point since the applicant had not argued the case on this basis.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, the English had {{dominated}} {{the trade in}} spices and textiles with Italy and Turkey. England consumed most of the olive oil and currants exported from those lands. However, after 1648 here too occurred a complete reversal {{in favor of the}} Dutch. The Genoese shifted their purchases to the Dutch entrepot and started to use Dutch shipping for their carrying trade predominantly. This was mostly due to the far-lower shipping rates the Dutch charged. But other factors in the sudden rise of the share the Dutch obtained in the intra-Mediterranean trade were the grip they obtained on the trade in Spanish bullion (often reminted as Dutch trade coins of high quality) to the Levant, and the progress the Dutch fine-cloth industry made with their products that were of a higher quality than the English. As a result, the English were thrown on the defensive in this area, too. To add insult to injury more and more imports that had reached England directly before, were from now on <b>re-exported</b> from the Amsterdam entrepot in Dutch ships.|$|E

Due to the globalization of the mushroom trade, most of the porcini commercially available in Italy or exported by Italy no longer originate there.
