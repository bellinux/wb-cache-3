40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{research}} managers’ motives of accounting policy choice for long-term nonfinancial assets.

40|$|The Black-Scholes(BS) {{model has}} been widely and {{successfully}} used to model the return of asset and to price financial options. Despite of its success the basic assumptions of this model, that is, Brownian motion and nor-mal distribution are not always supported by empirical studies. Those studies showed the two empirical phenomena: (1) the asymmetric leptokurtic features, (2) the volatility smile. The first means that the return distribution is skewed {{to the left and}} has a higher peak and two heavier tails than those of normal distri-bution, and the second means that if the BS model is correct, then the implied volatility should be flat. But the graph of the observed implied volatility curve often looks like the smile of the Cheshire cat. One of the causes for such phenomena is jumps in assets price processes. Figure 1 shows time series of 1 minute tick data of Yen/ $ exchange rate be-tween 15 : 00 and 24 : 00 on 21 st of July 2005 when Chinese Yuan was revaluated. It seems obvious that there was a jump {{at the time of the}} <b>revaluation.</b> Many <b>models</b> were pro-posed to explain the two empirical phenom-ena.

Among others we focus on a double exponential jump diffusion model proposed by Kou(2002) in this paper. Kou’s model is very simple and has rich theoretical implication as described below: The logarithm of the asset price is assumed to follow a Brownian motion plus a compound Poisson process with jump sizes double ex-ponentially distributed.

40|$|Variations in the Os- 187 /Os- 188 isotopic {{signature}} of mantle and mantle-derived rocks have been thought {{to provide a}} powerful chemical tracer of deep Earth structure. Many studies have inferred from such data that a long-lived, high-rhenium component exists in the deep mantle (Re- 187 is the parent isotope decaying to Os- 187, with a half-life of similar to 42 billion years), and that this reservoir probably consists of subducted oceanic crust(1 - 3). The interpretation of these {{isotopic signature}}s is, however, dependent on accurate estimates of rhenium and osmium concentrations {{in all of the}} main geochemical reservoirs, and the crust has generally been considered to be a minor contributor to such global budgets. In contrast, we here present observations of high rhenium concentrations and low Yb/Re ratios in arc-type melt inclusions. These results indicate strong enrichment of rhenium in undegassed arc rocks, and consequently the continental crust, which results in a crustal estimate of ~ 2 p. p. b. rhenium, as compared to previous estimates of 0. 4 - 0. 2 p. p. b. (refs 4, 5). Previous determinations of rhenium in arc materials, which were largely measured on subaerially erupted samples, are likely to be in error owing to rhenium loss during degassing.

40|$|The {{harmonization}} {{of international}} accounting standards has been implemented by more than 120 countries throughout the world. Although these standards have been criticised for disregarding local values and accounting systems, the IFRS and IAS provide many more benefits including enhancing the quality and transparency of financial statements. Unlike previous standards, the revised IFASS 16 – 2007 offers two options, the cost or revaluation models for fixed asset measurement. Therefore, conflict of interests may arise due to these options. The cost model favours reliability of its value (completeness, neutrality and freedom from error characteristics) while the <b>revaluation</b> <b>model</b> provides relevant information (predictive value and confirmatory value characteristics) to the public. This study first proposed a conceptual model that can help Indonesian CFOs in deciding to revalue or not to revalue fixed assets using decision support criteria such as motives, effects, primary decision criteria, business outcomes and impacts. The research then applied stratified random sampling for data gathering over the period of 2008 - 2012. Three categories were used such as companies’ age (young, middle, and old), size (small, medium, and large), and nine IDX industry classifications. A deterministic model was then developed using nine variables which were broken down into 17 proxies. The natural logarithm scenario provided the highest prediction power The R 2 of - 2 Log likelihood, Nagelkerke, and Cox Snell were 57. 69, 56. 4, and 75. 2 per cent consecutively. These scenarios also found the most significant variables among other scenarios with six proxies such as CMS, fixed asset intensity, DER, operating income, DER level, and export sales. Based on those significant proxies, this study concluded that companies’ internal benefits from asset revaluation decision making were more dominant than for external benefits. The internal benefits include four proxies (FAI, CMS, DER, and operating income) from three motives such as to gain efficiency/economics, to reduce debt contracting costs, and to reduce political costs. The external benefits include two proxies (DER level and export sales) from motives such as to provide signals for stakeholders; and to reduce information asymmetry. The results found that as of 31 st December 2012, only 2. 83 per cent of the total 460 Indonesian PLCs applied <b>revaluation</b> <b>model.</b> This figure cited is lower than other countries who have applied IAS 16 earlier than Indonesia such as South Korea, New Zealand, and England and Wales. The research confirms that Indonesian PLCs are cautious in applying the <b>revaluation</b> <b>model</b> because historically, previous IFASS 16 – 1994 only allowed PLCs to apply the cost model only. Furthermore, the <b>revaluation</b> <b>model</b> incurs more costs paid such as for the appraisal fees, auditor fees, and tax agency costs.

This study serves {{as the basis for the}} design of a revaluation guidance framework aimed at those who produce and use financial statements.

A diverse range of extant literature (relating to revaluation of publicly listed companies’ fixed assets in the Indonesian Stock Exchange) is synthesized to develop the conceptual model. The model embraces seven motive factors (Mn) and two revaluation effects factors (En) to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of financial aspects that should be considered before deciding to revalue. The effect factors can impact business outcomes and so are designed to feedback into the revaluation decision.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) promote a "true and fair" presentation of financial statements. The {{improvement of the}} quality of financial reporting helps investors, bankers and regulators make better decisions. Spanish GAAP, on the other hand, are based on a "prudent" approach for asset and liability recognition and valuation, with the goal of protecting stakeholders. Adjustments introduced as a consequence of IFRS adoption may result in (i) the recognition (or derecognition) of assets and liabilities for the first time (i. e. derivative financial assets and liabilities) and (ii) the application of accounting criteria that differs from those recognised under local GAAP (i. e. cost vs. <b>revaluation</b> <b>model).</b> The main objective {{of this study is to}} examine the financial statements of the firms listed on the Spanish Continuous Stock Market that have been using IFRS since 2005 to determine the accounting policy options they apply under IFRS and, most importantly, to provide evidence of the factors driving these choices. Since there are significant differences in reporting quality between countries as a consequence of different accounting regimes and institutional frameworks, mandatory IFRS adoption provides an opportunity to assess the economic consequences of these differences. The main finding of this paper is that companies apply the most conservative criteria to reduce the number of discrepancies between the two standards, particularly in regards to presentation and measurement practices. Nevertheless, the evitación from Spanish GAAP has a significant impact on reported equity and net income. Firms in Consumer services, Consumer goods, Oil and Gas, and Basic Materials, Manufacturing and Construction industries experience the largest adjustments. Additionally, we find that firm-specific factors such as industry, size, auditor’s opinion and capital structure influence the choice of accounting policy used to prepare financial statements.
