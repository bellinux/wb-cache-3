50|$|The Kermadec {{red-crowned parakeet}} (Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae cyanurus), {{also known as}} the Kermadec <b>red-fronted</b> <b>parakeet</b> or Kermadec parakeet, is a parrot endemic to New Zealand's Kermadec Islands in the {{south-west}} Pacific Ocean. It is a subspecies of the <b>red-fronted</b> <b>parakeet,</b> and sometimes considered a full species. It is also the first documented example of a parrot recolonising an island after the removal of invasive predators.|$|E
50|$|In early 2008, rat {{footprints}} {{were found}} in a tracking tunnel (a device to check {{for the presence of}} certain animals) on the island. This set off a substantial effort by the trust and DOC to catch the rodent, which was feared {{to be part of a}} larger infestation. The Norwegian rat was eventually trapped by a special hunting dog, allowing plans to release native <b>red-fronted</b> <b>parakeets</b> (kākāriki) to continue as planned in May 2008, when 31 were brought by helicopter from Little Barrier Island, where there is a relatively large population.|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{visit to}} the remote Kermadec {{archipelago}} and the translocation of two parakeet species to novel sites opened up opportunities to document aspects of the biology of free-living and captive-bred parakeets. Four years after the eradication of cats and rats on Raoul Island by the Department of Conservation, the Kermadec redfronted parakeet has naturally recolonised this site, potentially from the adjacent Herald Islets. Over a period of three weeks in March-April 2008, 100 parakeets were captured on Raoul Island and the first evidence of nesting of the species at this site since 1836 was recorded. These observations reinforce the view that eradication of introduced predators such as cats and rats is a requisite for the recovery and establishment of populations of New Zealand parakeets. These observations also suggest that strategic eradication of cats and rats can facilitate the natural dispersal of parakeets. Taking into account the remarkable recolonisation of parakeets on Raoul Island and the existence of islands free of introduced mammalian predators and <b>red-fronted</b> <b>parakeets</b> in the Hauraki Gulf, a translocation of parakeets was envisaged. Between April and May 2008, 32 <b>red-fronted</b> <b>parakeets</b> were translocated from Little Barrier Island to Motuihe Island, in the first translocation of the species within the Hauraki Gulf in 32 years. Alongside such transfer, a total of 62 captive-bred Malherbe’s parakeets were monitored on Maud Island, in the Marlborough Sounds. Because the translocations of <b>red-fronted</b> and Malherbe’s <b>parakeets</b> were temporally close, a unique opportunity to study translocated free-living and captive-bred parakeets was identified. The focus of monitoring on both sites was the detection of successful nesting attempts, a short-term measure of translocation success. On both sites (Motuihe and Maud Islands) evidence of successful nesting was found within a year of the release of the first flocks. As part of the planning steps for the translocation of <b>red-fronted</b> <b>parakeets,</b> a survey was designed for four selected microorganisms of conservation concern for New Zealand parrots: Campylobacter, Salmonella, Yersinia and the beak and feather disease virus (BFDV). Only the latest was detected at a prevalence of 28 % on Little Barrier Island. Subsequent isolation and sequencing of BFDV genomes revealed a previously undescribed genotype of this virus in New Zealand. The discovery of a new BFDV genome in a wild population of endemic New Zealand parakeets highlights need of future research. BFDV is known to affect the immune system and survival of infected individuals in other species and is likely to hamper conservation efforts for threatened parrot species. The challenges to study BFDV in New Zealand, a global hotspot of parrot diversity, are outlined and high priority lines of research are identified and discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{island is}} home to a number of native birds, mostly re-introduced. These include takahe, North Island kōkako, brown teal, stitchbird (hihi), North Island saddleback (tieke), tomtit (miromiro), fantail (piwakawaka), morepork (ruru), weka and North Island robin (toutouwai). The brown kiwi and little spotted kiwi were {{released}} on the island between 1890 and 1910, and the island is now the stronghold for the latter species. Rat eradication has led to increases in <b>red-fronted</b> <b>parakeets,</b> North Island robin, bellbirds, and saddlebacks, and the island is considered one of New Zealand's most important sites for bird recovery, as well as a major breeding site for sea birds. In April 2005, the critically endangered short-tailed bat was introduced to the island from a threatened population in the Tararuas, providing them with a separate, safer habitat.|$|R
50|$|The Lord Howe parakeet (Cyanoramphus subflavescens), {{also known}} as the Lord Howe <b>red-fronted</b> <b>parakeet,</b> is an extinct parrot endemic to Lord Howe Island in the Tasman Sea, part of New South Wales, Australia. It was {{described}} as full species by Tommaso Salvadori in 1891, but subsequently it has been regarded as subspecies of the red-crowned parakeet. In 2012, the IOC World Bird List recognised it as species.|$|E
5000|$|The New Caledonian parakeet (Cyanoramphus saisseti) [...] or New Caledonian red-crowned parakeet, is {{a species}} of parrot in the family Psittaculidae. It is endemic to New Caledonia. The species was once {{considered}} to be conspecific with the <b>red-fronted</b> <b>parakeet</b> of New Zealand but is now considered a full species and {{is known to be}} the basal species in the genus Cyanoramphus, which had its origins in New Caledonia.|$|E
5000|$|The {{taxonomy}} of some groups, {{in particular the}} Pyrrhura picta and the P. leucotis complexes, has changed significantly in recent years. In late 2008 it was proposed {{that the members of}} the P. picta complex from north-eastern Peru (the so-called [...] "group 6" [...] in Joseph, 2002) should be considered a new species, the Amazon <b>red-fronted</b> <b>parakeet,</b> P. parvifrons. This has yet to receive widespread recognition (e.g., by SACC), and consequently it is not included in the below list.|$|E
5000|$|Codfish Island is {{also home}} to {{southern}} short-tailed bats, kākā, fernbirds, <b>red-fronted</b> and yellow-crowned <b>parakeet,</b> Pacific black ducks and a recently introduced population of yellowheads (mohua).|$|R
2500|$|The islands hold {{important}} seabird breeding colonies, {{among them}} albatrosses, penguins and several small petrels, {{with a million}} pairs of sooty shearwater. [...] Landbirds include <b>red-fronted</b> and yellow-crowned <b>parakeet,</b> New Zealand falcon, tui, bellbirds, pipits and an endemic subspecies of tomtit.|$|R
5000|$|The Macquarie parakeet was {{previously}} {{considered to be}} a subspecies of the <b>red-fronted</b> <b>parakeet</b> C. novaezelandiae, which it resembled in appearance, but was later lumped with Reischek's parakeet from the Antipodes Islands in a 2001 paper by Wee Ming Boon and others following an examination of the molecular systematics of the genus which found that many of the red-crowned parakeet subspecies should be elevated to full species. [...] However, subsequently the provenance of Boon et al.’s supposed Macquarie Island material was shown to be mistaken, originating from the Antipodes Islands instead.|$|E
50|$|The {{red-crowned parakeet}} or <b>red-fronted</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae) , also widely {{known by its}} Māori name of kākāriki, is a small parrot from New Zealand. It is characterised by its bright green plumage and the red pattern on its head. This {{versatile}} bird can feed on a variety food items {{and can be found}} in many habitat types. It is classified as near threatened as invasive predators have pushed it out of its historical range. This species that used to occupy the whole country is now confined to only a few areas on the mainland and some offshore islands.|$|E
50|$|Ulva Island's {{relative}} isolation, but {{easy access}} from Stewart Island has {{allowed it to}} become an important natural resource area. It is a sanctuary for both birds and plants, holding species that on the mainland of New Zealand are rare or have died out. In 1997, the island was declared rat-free, following an eradication programme, and extirpated birds have been reintroduced to the island. The birds include the South Island saddleback (tieke), yellowhead (mohua) and Stewart Island robin. Other birds on the island that are rare on the mainland include the Stewart Island subspecies of southern brown kiwi (tokoeka), rifleman (Tītitipounamu), yellow-crowned and <b>red-fronted</b> <b>parakeet,</b> and South Island kākā or forest parrot, {{as well as several}} other species. The endangered yellow-eyed penguin uses the island for breeding sites.|$|E
5000|$|The {{three species}} of kākāriki or New Zealand parakeets {{are the most}} common species of parakeets in the genus Cyanoramphus, family Psittacidae. The birds' Māori name, which is the most {{commonly}} used, means [...] "small parrot". The etymology is: from kākā, parrot + riki, small. [...] The word is also used to refer to the colour green because of the birds' predominantly green plumage. The patches of red on the birds' rumps are, according to legend, the blood of the demigod Tāwhaki.The three species on mainland New Zealand are the yellow-crowned parakeet (Cyanoramphus auriceps), the red-crowned parakeet, or <b>red-fronted</b> <b>parakeet</b> (C. novaezelandiae), and the critically endangered Malherbe's parakeet or orange-fronted parakeet (not to be confused with Aratinga canicularis a popular aviary bird known as the orange-fronted conure, orange-fronted parakeet or half-moon conure - C. malherbi).|$|E
50|$|The Norfolk parakeet (Cyanoramphus cookii), {{also called}} Tasman parakeet, Norfolk Island green parrot or Norfolk Island red-crowned parakeet, is {{a species of}} parrot in the family Psittaculidae. It is endemic to Norfolk Island (located between Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia in the Tasman Sea). The species was once {{considered}} a subspecies of the <b>red-fronted</b> <b>parakeet</b> of New Zealand. The name Tasman parakeet is used by Christidis and Boles on the argument that this species and the Lord Howe red-crowned parakeet (Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae subflavescens) are probably a single species for which they use biogeographical arguments. Tasman is used for other species with the same distribution and they propose that name for that reason. However, the latter subspecies {{was not included in}} the genus-wide phylogenetic reconstruction using DNA sequences, and the lumping of the species should be considered tentative.|$|E
40|$|Psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD) is a {{viral disease}} {{distributed}} worldwide with a potentially critical impact on many rare parrots. While {{efforts have been}} made to determine its prevalence in wild and captive psittacines, only limited work has been done to document complete genomes of its causative agent, beak and feather disease virus (BFDV). Here, we describe five full genomes of BFDV isolated from wild specimens of an endemic New Zealand parrot, the <b>red-fronted</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae). The isolates share [99 % nucleotide similarity amongst themselves and * 91 – 92 % similarity to BFDV isolates from southern Africa, Europe and Australia. A maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree including 42 other full-genome sequences indicated that the five isolates from red-fronted parakeets represent an undescribed genotype of BFDV. These isolates are evolutionarily most closely related to the Cacatuini isolates from Thailand and the Lorinae isolates from Australia in the rep gene ML tree; however, in the cp ML tree, the evolutionary relationship is closer to viruses found in the Psittacini...|$|E
