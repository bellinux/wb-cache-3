40|$|The rising {{performance}} of broadband connections for residential users, particularly {{in conjunction with}} fiber to the home, will present a new challenge for telecom operators in the short and medium terms: how to deliver the high bit rate digital signals with high quality-of-service to all consumer devices scattered inside the building of final users? Among the many different solutions for the home network, we review in this article the use of polymer optical fibers for short-reach and high-capacity optical communications for <b>residential</b> <b>customer</b> <b>premises.</b> POF is an easy-to-install, low-cost, and eye-safe solution for these networks, with the potential of being future-proof. In this article {{the state of the}} art in POF technology is presented by summarizing significant results achieved in the European project POF-ALL. Data transmission rates of more than 1 Gb/s over 50 + m and 100 Mb/s over 200 + m of standard step-index POF have been show...|$|E
40|$|Electric {{utilities}} are increasingly incentivized to integrate new renewable energy generation resources to their systems; however, operations-related issues arise {{due to the}} non-dispatchable and stochastic nature of these renewable energy sources. These characteristics lead {{to a variety of}} issues for utilities, among which are voltage fluctuations, balancing dispatch against ramping events, short-duration power fluctuations, and the need to invest in peaking generation facilities just to accommodate the renewable energy. A traditional solution to these issues is to employ renewable generation-following techniques using either newly constructed gas peaking plants, or by shifting existing generation resources to this following responsibility. Unfortunately, use of these traditional methods introduces a new set of issues; namely, wear-and-tear due to more frequent cycling, reduced capacity factors, decreased plant efficiency, and additional investment in large-scale captial infrastructure. This thesis proposes an alternate solution: a utility-owned and utility-managed battery energy storage system sited on <b>residential</b> <b>customer</b> <b>premises,</b> deployed at scale to create a 200 MW / 1320 MWh distributed network of Residential Battery Energy Storage Systems (ResBESS). In partnership with Portland General Electric (PGE) stakeholders, a conceptual design was prepared for a ResBESS unit, a laboratory prototype of a single such storage system was constructed, and an alpha prototype is now being installed in a field demonstration project in Milwaukie, Oregon within PGE 2 ̆ 7 s service territory. The motivations, design constraints, and design methodology of the laboratory prototype are presented and discussed, and preliminary work from the field prototype build is examined to demonstrate the results of the thesis project...|$|E
40|$|Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) is {{a modern}} {{technology}} that uses digital coding techniques to transform ordinary phone lines (also known as “twisted copper pairs”) into high-speed data transfer lines. DSL offers an always-on dedicated connection that al-lows for simultaneous voice and data service. This paper fo-cuses the discussion on the DSL end-to-end implementation and using a Network Processor in DSL <b>Residential</b> Gateway (<b>Customer</b> <b>Premise</b> Equipment) design, such as DSL router, bridge and IAD to help for faster DSL deployment. Designing a DSL Residential Gateway based on the Intel(r) Network Pro-cessor architecture as an example, will help the developer shorten their design cycle, because the platform embeds the DSL network processor chip, RTOS, IP protocol stack, RFC 2364, RFC 1483 and network drivers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—During {{the last}} years next {{generation}} networks (NGNs) have gained attention, as {{an increasing number of}} network operators moved toward triple-play services: telephony, Internet and IPTV. Unfortunately, from the service provider per-spective, IPTV usually comes at a high cost in terms of equipment and/or necessary bandwidth. In this paper we propose Nozzilla, a peer-to-peer like video streaming service for an NGN based on the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), which can be used by third-party IPTV service providers as a cost effective alternative to IP multicast or content distribution networks. The service uses the <b>residential</b> gateways (NGN <b>customer</b> <b>premises</b> equipment) to create a streaming overlay using the remaining or a fixed amount of network bandwidth. Nozzilla takes advantage of the QoS and resource reservation enabled by a NGN to support multiple-description streaming that improves the perceived quality during temporary failures. I...|$|R
50|$|Electric power {{distribution}} {{is the final}} stage {{in the delivery of}} electric power; it carries electricity from the transmission system to individual consumers. Distribution substations connect to the transmission system and lower the transmission voltage to medium voltage ranging between 2 kV and 35 kV with the use of transformers. Primary distribution lines carry this medium voltage power to distribution transformers located near the <b>customer's</b> <b>premises.</b> Distribution transformers again lower the voltage to the utilization voltage used by lighting, industrial equipment or household appliances. Often several customers are supplied from one transformer through secondary distribution lines. Commercial and <b>residential</b> <b>customers</b> are connected to the secondary distribution lines through service drops. Customers demanding a much larger amount of power may be connected directly to the primary distribution level or the subtransmission level.|$|R

40|$|In the United States from 2001 to 2006, federal {{regulations}} allowed entrants to lease from incumbents at relatively low cost {{all of the}} network infrastructure necessary to provide local phone service. These platform entrants could then provide phone service without installing any of their own equipment. Advocates of this policy claimed that it was needed to provide an economically feasible means by which entrants could serve <b>residential</b> <b>customers.</b> Critics contended that the policy substantially deterred loop entry whereby entrants installed their own switching equipment and leased only the wires that connect a <b>customer’s</b> <b>premises</b> to the telephone network. An analysis of panel data for each state over this period indicates that the policy’s critics may have been correct. The cross-price elasticity of loop entry with respect to platform price was roughly 1. 0. A back of the envelope calculation suggests that loop entry may have decreased by roughly 20 % due to platform entry price reductions. ∗I thank Donald Stockdale and Ellen Burton of the FCC for their insights into the FCC data.

40|$|Despite {{the recent}} rapid {{adoption}} of rooftop solar PV for <b>residential</b> <b>customers,</b> islanded operation during grid outages remains elusive for most PV owners. In this paper we consider approaches {{to improve the}} reliability of electricity supply {{in the context of}} a residential microgrid, consisting of a group of <b>residential</b> <b>customers</b> each with rooftop solar PV, that are connected to the distribution network via a single point of common coupling. It is assumed that there is insufficient PV generation at all times to meet the electricity demand within the residential microgrid. Three optimization-based algorithms are proposed to improve the reliability of electricity supply to each <b>residential</b> <b>customer,</b> despite variability and intermittency of the solar resource and periods of infrequent and sustained power outages in the electricity grid. By means of a case study we show that the majority of <b>residential</b> <b>customers</b> achieve greater reliability of uninterrupted electricity supply when connecting to the residential microgrid in comparison to operating in isolated self-consumption mode.
