5|$|Revolving bookcase: Revolving bookcases, {{known as}} zhuanluntang, have been {{documented}} in ancient China, and its invention is credited to Fu Xi in 544. Descriptions of revolving bookcases {{have been found in}} 8th- and 9th-century Chinese texts. Revolving bookcases were popularized in Buddhist monasteries during the Song Dynasty under the reign of Emperor Taizu, who ordered the mass printing of the Buddhist Tripiṭaka scriptures.

25|$|Four {{months after}} Poirot's death, Hastings {{receives}} a manuscript in which Poirot explains all. X was Norton, {{a man who}} had perfected the technique of which Iago in Othello (and a character in Ervine's play) is master: applying just such psychological pressure as is needed to provoke someone to commit murder, without his victim realising what is happening. Norton had demonstrated this ability, with Colonel Luttrell, with Hastings, and Mrs Franklin. Poirot intervened with sleeping pills in Hastings' hot chocolate that night, to avert a disastrous rash action. Ironically, Hastings had unwittingly intervened in Mrs. Franklin's plan to poison her husband, by turning a <b>revolving</b> <b>bookcase</b> table while seeking a book to solve a crossword clue (Othello again), thus swapping the cups of coffee, so Mrs Franklin poisoned herself. Poirot could not prove this. He sensed that Norton, who had been deliberately vague about whom he had seen through the binoculars, would hint that he had seen Franklin and Judith, to implicate them in the murder of Mrs Franklin, not inadvertent suicide as it was. This explains Poirot's testimony at her inquest, to ensure the police would stop their investigation.|$|E
500|$|While {{the design}} of the bookwheel is {{commonly}} credited to Ramelli, some historians dispute that {{he was the first to}} invent such a device. Joseph Needham, a historian of Chinese technology, stated that <b>revolving</b> <b>bookcases,</b> though not vertically oriented, had their origins in China [...] "perhaps a thousand years before Ramelli's design was taken there." ...|$|R
5|$|Besides clockwork, hydraulic-powered armillary spheres, odometers, and {{mechanical}} compass vehicles, {{there were other}} impressive devices of mechanical engineering found during the Song dynasty. Although literary references for mechanical revolving repositories and book cases of Buddhist temples trace back to at least 823 during the Tang dynasty, they came to prominence during the Song dynasty. The invention of the revolving book case is considered to have happened earlier, and is credited to the layman Fu Xi in 544. <b>Revolving</b> <b>bookcases</b> were popularized in Buddhist monasteries during the Song dynasty under the reign of Emperor Taizu, who ordered the mass printing of the Buddhist Tripiṭaka scriptures.|$|R
50|$|Some {{experts believe}} that the prayer wheels evolved from <b>revolving</b> {{octagonal}} Chinese <b>bookcases</b> which were first recorded in the 9th century CE. This assumption {{is supported by the}} existence of octagonal prayer wheels in Mongolia.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, {{how does}} a man search a <b>revolving</b> <b>bookcase?</b> He does not {{generally}} hop all round it in a squatting attitude, like a frog. He simply gives it a touch and makes it revolve." ...|$|E
60|$|The rector's {{office in}} the parish house was a businesslike room on the first floor, fitted up with a desk, a table, straight-backed chairs, and a <b>revolving</b> <b>bookcase.</b> And to it, one windy morning in March, came Eleanor Goodrich. Hodder rose to greet her with an eagerness which, from his kindly yet {{penetrating}} glance, she did not suspect.|$|E
60|$|It was then, perhaps, {{a quarter}} to six, and the blinds were closely drawn and the house quite silent. The landing was a spacious one, a broad, richly-carpeted {{staircase}} went down {{into the darkness of}} the hall below, and before me a door ajar showed me a writing-desk, a <b>revolving</b> <b>bookcase,</b> the back of a study chair, and a fine array of bound books, shelf upon shelf.|$|E

However, there were nine prominently known revolving repositories during the Song period, {{and one of them}} was even featured in an illustration of Li Jie's book Yingzao Fashi ('Treatise on Architectural Methods') of 1103. The rotating repository of 1119 in Kaifu Temple near Changsha had five wheels which all turned together, and the revolving repository at Nanchan Temple of Suzhou featured a brake system of some sort (sinologists are still uncertain how this operated, since the earliest known curve brake bands appear in the time of Leonardo da Vinci in Europe). A later Muslim traveler Shah Rukh (son of the Turco-Mongol warlord Timur) came to Ming dynasty China in 1420 during the reign of the Yongle Emperor, and described a revolving repository in Ganzhou of Gansu province that he called a 'kiosque': ...|$|R
60|$|They found {{themselves}} plunging through the club smoking {{room and the}} library beyond, in complete darkness, mental as well as material. But Horne Fisher, {{in spite of his}} affectation of indifference, was a person of a curious and almost transcendental sensibility to atmospheres, and he already felt the presence of something more than an accident. He collided with a piece of furniture in the library, and almost shuddered with the shock, for the thing moved as he could never have fancied a piece of furniture moving. It seemed to move like a living thing, yielding and yet striking back. The next moment Grayne had turned on the lights, and he saw he had only stumbled against one of the revolving bookstands that had swung round and struck him; but his involuntary recoil had revealed to him his own subconscious sense of something mysterious and monstrous. There were several of these <b>revolving</b> <b>bookcases</b> standing here and there about the library; on one of them stood the two cups of coffee, and on another a large open book. It was Budge's book on Egyptian hieroglyphics, with colored plates of strange birds and gods, and even as he rushed past, he was conscious of something odd about the fact that this, and not any work of military science, should be open in that place at that moment. He was even conscious of the gap in the well-lined bookshelf from which it had been taken, and it seemed almost to gape at him in an ugly fashion, like a gap in the teeth of some sinister face.|$|R
60|$|The stranger's manner was {{compounded}} of dignified impudence {{combined with}} pathetic humility. His eyes both challenged and pleaded. Tommy {{held out her}} hand for the paper and retired with it behind the protection of the big editorial desk that, flanked on one side by a screen and on the other by a formidable <b>revolving</b> <b>bookcase,</b> stretched fortress-like across the narrow room. The stranger remained standing.|$|E
6000|$|PARAMORE (rising). Well, you {{can make}} up for lost time now. (Bitterly, shewing Craven the Journal) There! you can read for yourself. The camel was fed on beef {{dissolved}} in alcohol; and he gained weight under it. Eat and drink as much as you please. (Still unable to stand without support, he makes his way past Cuthbertson to the <b>revolving</b> <b>bookcase</b> and stands there with his back to them, leaning on it with his head on his hand.) ...|$|E
6000|$|Boileau {{took the}} only other chair, The Infant, by right of his bulk, the sofa; and Nevin, being a little man, sat cross-legged {{on the top of}} the <b>revolving</b> <b>bookcase,</b> and we all said, [...] "Who'd ha' thought it!" [...] and [...] "What are you doing here?" [...] till {{speculation}} was exhausted and the talk went over to inevitable [...] "shop." [...] Boileau was full of a great scheme for winning a military attaché-ship at St. Petersburg; Nevin had hopes of the Staff College, and The Infant had been moving heaven and earth and the Horse Guards for a commission in the Egyptian army.|$|E
6000|$|After a moment's pause he went on. [...] "You reconstructed {{the crime}} with admirable skill, old chap, {{and nearly all}} you said was true. Two men with two coffee cups did go into the library and did put their cups on the bookstand and did go {{together}} to the well, {{and one of them}} was a murderer and had put poison in the other's cup. But it was not done while Boyle was looking at the <b>revolving</b> <b>bookcase.</b> He did look at it, though, searching for the Budge book with the note in it, but I fancy that Hastings had already moved it to the shelves on the wall. It was part of that grim game that he should find it first.|$|E
6000|$|Next day at noon, in the Library of the Ibsen club. A spacious room, {{with glass}} doors right and left. At the back, in the middle, is the fireplace, surmounted by a {{handsome}} mantelpiece, with {{a bust of}} Ibsen, and decorated inscriptions of the titles of his plays. There are circular recesses at each side of fireplace, with divan seats running round them, and windows at the top, {{the space between the}} divan and the window sills being lined with books. A long settee is placed before the fire. Along the back of the settee, and touching it, is a green table, littered with journals. A <b>revolving</b> <b>bookcase</b> stands in the foreground, a little to the left, with an easy chair close to it. On the right, between the door and the recess, is a light library stepladder. Placards inscribed [...] "silence" [...] are conspicuously exhibited here and there.|$|E
6000|$|As to {{the shape}} of the bookcases, and the furniture, and {{ornaments}} of the library, every amateur will please himself. Perhaps the satin-wood or mahogany tabernacles of rare books are best made after the model of what furniture-dealers indifferently call the [...] "Queen Anne" [...] or the [...] "Chippendale" [...] style. There is a pleasant quaintness in the carved architectural ornaments of the top, and the inlaid flowers of marquetry go well with the pretty florid editions of the last century, the books that were illustrated by Stothard and Gravelot. Ebony suits theological tomes very well, especially when they are bound in white vellum. As to furniture, people who can afford it will imitate the arrangements of Lucullus, in Mr. Hill Burton's charming volume [...] "The Book-hunter" [...] (Blackwood, Edinburgh, 1862).--"Everything is of perfect finish,--the mahogany-railed gallery, the tiny ladders, the broad winged lecterns, with leathern cushions on the edges to keep the wood from grazing the rich bindings, the books themselves, each shelf uniform with its facings, or rather backings, like well-dressed lines at a review." [...] The late Sir William Stirling-Maxwell, a famous bibliophile, invented a very nice library chair. It is most comfortable to sit on; and, as the top of the back is broad and flat, it {{can be used as a}} ladder of two high steps, when one wants to reach a book on a lofty shelf. A kind of square <b>revolving</b> <b>bookcase,</b> an American invention, manufactured by Messrs. Trubner, is useful to the working man of letters. Made in oak, stained green, it is not unsightly. As to ornaments, every man to his taste. You may have a [...] "pallid bust of Pallas" [...] above your classical collection, or fill the niches in a shrine of old French light literature, pastoral and comedy, with delicate shepherdesses in Chelsea china. On such matters a modest writer, like Mr. Jingle when Mr. Pickwick ordered dinner, [...] "will not presume to dictate." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1876, John Danner of Canton, Ohio, {{invented a}} <b>revolving</b> <b>bookcase</b> with a {{patented}} [...] "pivot and post" [...] design. The ingenuity {{of his work}} resided in the economy of space it provided. Thirty-two volumes of the American Cyclopedia could be stored in a compact space, and readily available for perusal {{at the touch of}} a finger. Danner's bookcase appeared in the 1894 Montgomery Ward catalog. In 1878 he exhibited his bookcases at the Paris International Exhibition and won a gold medal. The John Danner Manufacturing Company was known for honorable workmanship and affordability. The woods were oak, black walnut, western ash, and Philippine mahogany. Viewed as a progressive businessman, Danner was credited with drawing a large trade and business to the city of Canton.|$|E
5000|$|John Danner (March 10, 1823 - April 12, 1918) invented and {{patented}} (May 16, 1876) [...] {{the pivot}} and post <b>revolving</b> <b>bookcase.</b> His bookcase hangs suspended {{from a simple}} cast iron bearing which sits {{on top of an}} inner column or post. The revolving mechanism consists of two nesting cast iron cones that provide a precise pivot point supporting the entire weight of the bookcase. The top support suspension design addressed the binding and racking problems of previous bottom bearing Lazy Susan type bookcases. [...] "These cases, with their immense load, revolve with a slight touch of the hand; are noiseless in operation, and will last a lifetime." [...] Originally designed to hold 32 volumes of the Encyclopedia, it is a compact, rotating bookcase. [...] "It is a square of 22 inches taking up no more room on the floor than an ordinary chair." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{late nineteenth}} century and early twentieth century saw the {{emergence}} of the Glasgow School, a term that is used for a number of loose groups based around the city. The most important grouping, active from about 1890 and known as [...] "The Four" [...] or the [...] "Spook School", included acclaimed architect and artist Charles Rennie Mackintosh (1868-1928). They produced a distinctive blend of influences, including the Celtic Revival, the Arts and Crafts Movement, and Japonisme, which found favour throughout the modern art world of continental Europe and helped define the Art Nouveau style. Beside important buildings and paintings, Mackintosh also produced significant and influential objects, including his 1904 designs for an order desk chair for the Willow Tea Rooms in Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow, based on a highly geometrised version of the willow tree, and his <b>Revolving</b> <b>Bookcase</b> for Hous'hill, which prefigured the international style of the next generation.|$|E
