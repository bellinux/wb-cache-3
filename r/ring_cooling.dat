5000|$|Gabrielse was {{a pioneer}} in the field of low energy {{antiproton}} and antihydrogen physics by proposing the trapping of antiprotons from a storage <b>ring,</b> <b>cooling</b> them in collisions with trapped electrons, and the use of these to form low energy antihydrogen atoms. [...] He led the TRAP team that realized the first antiproton trapping, the first electron cooling of trapped antiprotons, and the accumulation of antiprotons in a 4 Kelvin apparatus. [...] The demonstrations and methods made possible an effort that grew to involve 4 international collaborations of physicists working at CERN's Antiproton Decelerator. In 1999, Gabrielse's TRAP team made the most precise test of the Standard Model's fundamental CPT theorem by comparing the charge-to-mass ratio of a single trapped antiproton with that of a proton to a precision of 9 parts in 1011. The precision of the resulting confirmation of the Standard Model prediction exceeded that of earlier comparisons by nearly a factor of 106.|$|E

The model predicts that the sudden acceleration of the ring causes {{a slight increase in}} the inertial mass of the gyroscope, and, to conserve momentum the gyroscope must move with the ring with an acceleration ratio of 2. 67 +/- 0. 24 * 10 ^- 8 for clockwise rotations and 1. 34 +/- 0. 12 * 10 ^- 8 for anticlockwise ones, in agreement with the observations.
