This transfer is induced by a radiofrequency field with a high-purity σ^+ polarization tuned at resonance on Stark transitions inside the hydrogenic Rydberg manifold. We observe over a few microseconds more than twenty coherent Rabi oscillations between the initial Rydberg state and the circular <b>Rydberg</b> <b>level.</b> We characterize in details these complex oscillations involving many Rydberg levels and find them to be in perfect agreement with a simple theoretical model. This coherent transfer procedure opens the way to hybrid quantum gates bridging the gap between optical communication and quantum information manipulations based on microwave Cavity and Circuit Quantum Electrodynamics.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{spectroscopy}} of NO <b>Rydberg</b> <b>levels</b> {{has been}} a subject of continuing interest for over 50 years. The low ionization potential of NO # 9. 25 eV#, makes the <b>Rydberg</b> <b>levels</b> accessible by one-photon excitation at vacuum ultraviolet #VUV# wavelengths around 130 nm. The detailed absorption spectra recorded with the high resolution spectrographs at the National Research Council in Ottawa {{have been published in}} atlas form. A review of the early work was published in 1976. More recently, NO <b>Rydberg</b> <b>levels</b> have been accessed by multiphoton laser excitation techniques, which conveniently allow the use of longer wavelength radiation and result in excitation to <b>Rydberg</b> <b>levels</b> not accessible by a one-photon transition. 3 [...] 18 The optical selection rule for the change in the atomiclike orbital angular momentum of the Rydberg electron is #### 1 for each photon absorbed in the transition.

40|$|Abstract. We obtain {{expressions}} for <b>Rydberg</b> <b>level</b> broadening {{and shift}} cross sections and rates suitable for elastic collisions of ground-state rare-gas atoms with Rydberg atoms. The semiclassical impact broadening theory is used. The interaction of a Rydberg atom with a rare-gas atom is approximated by the superposition of polarisation potentials and the Fermi pseudopotential. It is shown that similar expressions for the broadening and shift cross sections {{due to the}} perturber-Rydberg-electron interaction can be obtained in the JWKB approximation for the Rydberg-electron wavefunctions and for the square-well model potential. Consequently the shift and width of the <b>Rydberg</b> <b>level</b> are not very sensitive {{to the shape of}} the potential but only to its normalisation. Expressions for the shift and width in the square-well potential approximation suitable in the high-density limit of the perturb-ing atoms are obtained. Limits of the applicability of the expressions for the broadening and shift cross sections are discussed. Calculated broadening and shift rates agree well with experimental results for the broadening and shift of Rydberg levels with small, medium and large principal quantum numbers by all rare gases excepting neon. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the coherent manipulation of interacting Rydberg atoms placed inside a high-finesse optical cavity for the deterministic preparation of strongly coupled light-matter systems. We consider a four-level diamond scheme with one common <b>Rydberg</b> <b>level</b> for N interacting atoms. One {{side of the}} diamond is used to excite the atoms into a collective `superatom' Rydberg state using either π-pulses or stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) pulses. The upper transition {{on the other side}} of the diamond is used to transfer the collective state to one that is coupled to a field mode of an optical cavity. Due to the strong interaction between the atoms in the <b>Rydberg</b> <b>level,</b> the Rydberg blockade mechanism plays a key role in the deterministic quantum state synthesis of the atoms in the cavity. We use numerical simulation to show that non-classical states of light can be generated and that the state that is coupled to the cavity field is a collective one. We also investigate how different decay mechanisms affect this interacting many-body system. We also analyze our system in the case of two Rydberg excitations within the blockade volume. The simulations are carried out with parameters corresponding to realizable high-finesse optical cavities and alkali atoms like rubidium. Comment: 38 pages, 12 figure...|$|E

Previous research (Kono et al 2013 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt.

40|$|The {{development}} of the optical frequency comb technique has transformed the field of spectroscopy, allowing the measurement of atomic transition frequencies to unprecedented levels of accuracy. In this thesis a frequency comb {{has been used to}} make absolute frequency measurements of optical transitions to highly excited <b>Rydberg</b> <b>levels</b> in Rb. The reliable measurement of these levels {{plays an important role in}} improving the accuracy of atomic models and the widely used Rb atom is an excellent candidate for such studies. A laser system has been constructed and optimised for resolving these highly excited states in an ordinary vapour cell, using a Doppler-free technique of purely optical detection. After several developments to the apparatus, the absolute energies of a collection of <b>Rydberg</b> <b>levels</b> have been measured to an accuracy of 3 parts in 1010, demonstrating the first sub-megahertz accuracy optical Rydberg spectroscopy. A vapour cell is a convenient and straightforward solution for finding <b>Rydberg</b> <b>levels</b> and these findings show that cell-based detection techniques could potentially permit rapid advances in the field. Along the way, the vapour cell sample has also highlighted many interesting areas of exploration: For example, it has allowed long term laser stabilisation to <b>Rydberg</b> <b>levels</b> for experiments such as the micromaser. Also, the Rydberg atoms in the cell have been manipulated by microwaves, allowing the study of high ` = 4 states, which has illuminated a whole range of new experiments. It has even been found that one of the limiting factors of these cell-based schemes may be the knowledge of the frequency of lower lying transitions, which has ultimately led this research into a secondary area, involving the measurement of the Rb D lines with a frequency comb. Together, these findings have exposed a large variety of atomic physics to be investigated in the future. ...|$|R

The separation between the cold surface {{and the center of}} the collimated beam is adjustable down to 250 μm.

Further coherent manipulation of the ns <b>Rydberg</b> <b>levels</b> with pulsed microwave radiation above the surfaces enabled measurements of stray electric fields and allowed us to study the decoherence of the atomic ensemble. Adsorption of residual gas onto the surfaces and the resulting slow build-up of stray fields was minimized by controlling the temperature of the surface and monitoring the partial pressures of H_ 2 O, N_ 2, O_ 2 and CO_ 2 in the experimental chamber during the cool-down.

40|$|A {{two-level}} quantum system coherently {{driven by}} a resonant electromagnetic field oscillates sinusoidally between the two levels at frequency Ω which {{is proportional to the}} field amplitude [1]. This phenomenon, known as the Rabi oscillation, has been at the heart of atomic, molecular and optical physics since the seminal work of its namesake and coauthors [2]. Notably, Rabi oscillations in isolated single atoms or dilute gases form the basis for metrological applications such as atomic clocks and precision measurements of physical constants [3]. Both inhomogeneous distribution of coupling strength to the field and interactions between individual atoms reduce the visibility of the oscillation and may even suppress it completely. A remarkable transformation takes place in the limit where only a single excitation can be present in the sample due to either initial conditions or atomic interactions: there arises a collective, many-body Rabi oscillation at a frequency N^ 0. 5 Ω involving all N >> 1 atoms in the sample [4]. This is true even for inhomogeneous atom-field coupling distributions, where single-atom Rabi oscillations may be invisible. When one of the two levels is a strongly interacting <b>Rydberg</b> <b>level,</b> many-body Rabi oscillations emerge {{as a consequence of the}} Rydberg excitation blockade.
