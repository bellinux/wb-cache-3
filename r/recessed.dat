5|$|The end bays of {{the west}} (main) facade are framed in pedimented pavilions, which have <b>recessed</b> brick panels above the impost line, and below it are bricks coursed to {{resemble}} rustication. One glazed roundel is at the middle of each tympanum. The pedimented central bay has an arched <b>recessed</b> entrance {{with a pair of}} oversized double wood doors beneath a fanlight. The arch is flanked with blind roundels above the impost line, with rustication below. The bay's tympanum is undecorated. The arch impost line continues as a belt course between the pavilions and forms the sills for <b>recessed</b> wood-framed, fixed-sashed, nine-light windows on the building's second level. The windows are divided by Doric pilasters.|$|E

40|$|Method {{of forming}} a {{metallic}} structure (2) in a micro-machined <b>recess</b> that {{is provided in}} a surface of a semiconductor substrate (8).

40|$|A {{safe and}} healthy <b>recess</b> {{promotes}} a Culture of Health in schools by providing students {{time to develop}} socially, emotionally, physically, and academically. During <b>recess,</b> students learn and practice important social and emotional skills, such as conflict resolution, decision-making, compromise, and self-regulation. They also have opportunities for physical activity, and to engage with peers and adults who they might not see in their classrooms. These benefits make <b>recess</b> an important addition to classroom activities, not a "break" from learning that can be shortened or eliminated {{in favor of more}} instructional time. School leaders who are responsible for <b>recess</b> policies generally understand both the value of <b>recess</b> and the importance of making <b>recess</b> safe and healthy for all students, but many also report they need more <b>recess</b> staff, more equipment, and better training for their <b>recess</b> monitoring staff to realize these goals (Gallup, 2010).

This led to the construction of Art Deco structures in New York City with significant setbacks, large volumes, and striking silhouettes that were often decorated elaborately.|$|E

5|$|Many {{of these}} species have adaptations to help in under-water locomotion. Water beetles and water bugs have legs adapted into paddle-like structures. Dragonfly naiads use jet propulsion, {{forcibly}} expelling water out of their rectal chamber. Some species like the water striders are capable of walking {{on the surface of}} water. They can do this because their claws are not at the tips of the legs as in most insects, but <b>recessed</b> in a special groove further up the leg; this prevents the claws from piercing the water's surface film. Other insects such as the Rove beetle Stenus are known to emit pygidial gland secretions that reduce surface tension making it possible for them to move on the surface of water by Marangoni propulsion (also known by the German term Entspannungsschwimmen).|$|E
