5|$|Several plays {{have shaped}} Edward's {{contemporary}} image. Christopher Marlowe's play Edward II was first performed around 1592, {{and focuses on}} Edward's relationship with Piers Gaveston, reflecting 16th-century concerns about the relationships between monarchs and their favourites. Marlowe presents Edward's death as a murder, drawing parallels between the killing and martyrdom; although Marlowe does not describe the actual nature of Edward's murder in the script, it has usually been performed following the tradition that Edward was killed with a <b>red-hot</b> <b>poker.</b> The character of Edward in the play, who has been likened to Marlowe's contemporaries James VI of Scotland and Henry III of France, may have influenced William Shakespeare's portrayal of Richard II. In the 17th century, the playwright Ben Jonson picked up the same theme for his unfinished work, Mortimer His Fall.|$|E
5|$|The French monarchy {{asserted}} its {{rights to}} encroach on Edward's legal rights in Gascony. Resistance to one judgement in Saint-Sardos resulted in Charles IV declaring the duchy forfeit. Charles's sister, Queen Isabella, {{was sent to}} negotiate and agreed a treaty that required Edward to pay homage in France to Charles. Edward resigned Aquitaine and Ponthieu to his son Edward, who travelled to France to give homage in his stead. With the English heir in her power, Isabella refused to return to England unless Edward II dismissed his favourites, and she became the mistress of Roger Mortimer. The couple invaded England and, with Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, captured the king. Edward II abdicated on condition that his son would inherit the throne rather than Mortimer. Although there is no historical record of the cause of death, he is popularly {{believed to have been}} murdered at Berkeley Castle by having a <b>red-hot</b> <b>poker</b> thrust into his bowels. A coup by Edward III ended four years of control by Isabella and Mortimer. Mortimer was executed. Though removed from power, Isabella was treated well, and lived in luxury for the next 27 years.|$|E
25|$|The War of Saint-Sardos, a short {{conflict}} between Edward and the Kingdom of France, led indirectly to Edward's overthrow. The French monarchy used {{the jurisdiction of}} the Parlement of Paris to overrule decisions of the nobility's courts. As a French vassal, Edward felt this encroachment in Gascony with the French kings adjudicating disputes between him and his French subjects. Without confrontation he could do little but watch the duchy shrink. Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent, decided to resist one such judgement in Saint-Sardos with the result that Charles IV declared the duchy forfeit. Charles's sister, Queen Isabella, was sent to negotiate and agreed to a treaty that required Edward to pay homage in France to Charles. Edward resigned Aquitaine and Ponthieu to his son, Prince Edward, who travelled to France to give homage in his stead. With the English heir in her power, Isabella refused to return to England unless Edward II dismissed his favourites and also formed a relationship with Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March. The couple invaded England and, joined by Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, captured the king. Edward II abdicated on the condition that his son would inherit the throne rather than Mortimer. He is generally believed to have been murdered at Berkeley Castle by having a <b>red-hot</b> <b>poker</b> thrust into his bowels. In 1330 a coup by Edward III ended four years of control by Isabella and Mortimer. Mortimer was executed, but although removed from power, Isabella was treated well, living in luxury for the next 27 years.|$|E

When Nicholas was a small child, he was exploring the forbidden torture chamber when his father (also played by Price) entered the room with his mother Isabella and Sebastian's brother, Bartolome. Hiding in a corner, Nicholas watched in horror as his father repeatedly hit Bartolome with a <b>red-hot</b> <b>poker,</b> screaming [...] "Adulterer!" [...] at him. After murdering Bartolome, Sebastian began torturing his wife slowly to death in front of Nicholas.|$|E
500|$|The Chinese warlord General Henry Chang (Warner Oland) in the 1932 film Shanghai Express, who is {{presented}} as being not only as Eurasian, but as having a menacing asexuality that places him outside of the conventionally defined world of Western sexuality and racial order, making him as dangerous to the Western characters who he has taken hostage {{as much as the}} fact that he is a vicious warlord. Though Chang is Eurasian, he takes pride in his Chinese heritage while rejecting his American heritage, which confirms his Eastern identity. War-torn China, circa 1931 {{is presented}} as a [...] "hell", which a diverse group of Westerners must travel through on a nightmarish train trip from Beijing to Shanghai, which takes a turn for the worse when the train is hijacked by Chang and his men. The film strongly hints that Chang is bisexual, who not only wants to rape the heroine Shanghai Lily (Marlene Dietrich), but also the hero Captain Donald [...] "Doc" [...] Harvey (Clive Brook). When the German opium smuggler Erich Baum (Gustav von Seyffertitz) insults Chang, the result is a scene where the warlord commits a symbolic rape, as the sadistic Chang clearly takes sexual pleasure in branding Baum with a <b>red-hot</b> <b>poker.</b> After he is branded (the symbol of slavery), the once proud Baum becomes notably cowed and submissive towards Chang who in a certain sense now [...] "owes" [...] him , which reflected the ultimate Yellow Peril fear of Westerners becoming the slaves of the East and its perverted sexuality. Later on, Chang does actually rape Hui Fei (Anna May Wong). Gina Marchetti suggests that Chang's desire to blind Harvey is not only meant literally, but is also a metaphor for castration, which even under the more permissive Production code in effect in 1932 would have been a taboo subject. In a marked contrast to Chang's twisted sexuality and his [...] "almost effeminate polish" [...] , the British Army Captain Harvey is a resolutely heterosexual, ruggedly tough soldier with a deep romantic streak who more than amply proved his manliness in the trenches of World War I, presenting a model of Western masculinity and strength.|$|E

60|$|It {{is ridiculous}} to say, as inconsiderate amateurs {{of the arts}} do, that art {{has nothing to do}} with morality. What is true is that the artist's {{business}} is not that of the policeman; and that such factitious consequences and put-up jobs as divorces and executions and the detective operations that lead up to them are no essential part of life, though, like poisons and buttered slides and <b>red-hot</b> <b>pokers,</b> they provide material for plenty of thrilling or amusing stories suited to people who are incapable of any interest in psychology. But the fine artists must keep the policeman out of his studies of sex and studies of crime. It is by clinging nervously to the policeman that most of the pseudo sex plays convince me that the writers have either never had any serious personal experience of their ostensible subject, or else have never conceived it possible that the stage door present the phenomena of sex as they appear in nature.|$|R
60|$|It takes {{people a}} long time to learn the {{difference}} between talent and genius, especially ambitious young men and women. Amy was learning this distinction through much tribulation, for mistaking enthusiasm for inspiration, she attempted every branch of art with youthful audacity. For {{a long time}} there was a lull in the 'mud-pie' business, and she devoted herself to the finest pen-and-ink drawing, in which she showed such taste and skill that her graceful handiwork proved both pleasant and profitable. But over-strained eyes caused pen and ink to be laid aside for a bold attempt at poker-sketching. While this attack lasted, the family lived in constant fear of a conflagration, for the odor of burning wood pervaded the house at all hours, smoke issued from attic and shed with alarming frequency, <b>red-hot</b> <b>pokers</b> lay about promiscuously, and Hannah never went to bed without a pail of water and the dinner bell at her door in case of fire.

2500|$|According to legend, Isabella and Mortimer famously plotted {{to murder}} Edward {{in such a}} way as not to draw blame on themselves, sending a famous order (in [...] ) which, {{depending}} on where the comma was inserted, could mean either [...] "Do not be afraid to kill Edward; it is good" [...] or [...] "Do not kill Edward; it is good to fear". [...] In actuality, there is little evidence of anyone deciding to have Edward assassinated, and none whatsoever of the note having been written. Similarly, accounts of Edward being killed with a <b>red-hot</b> <b>poker</b> have no strong contemporary sources to support them. The conventional 20th-century view has been that Edward did die at Berkeley Castle, either murdered on Isabella's orders or of ill-health brought on by his captivity, and that subsequent accounts of his survival were simply rumours, similar to those that surrounded Joan of Arc and other near contemporaries after their deaths.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most notable}} of the Macaulays was Dòmhnall Cam (also known as Donald Cam) (c. 1560 – c. 1640) who appears {{frequently}} in Lewis lore {{as the subject}} of many stories told today in Uig. The Gaelic byname cam commonly means [...] "squint" [...] or [...] "blind in one eye"; and according to tradition Dòmhnall Cam lost his eye in a quarrel with Gobha Ban (the smith of Kneep) who put out his eye with a <b>red-hot</b> <b>poker.</b> There are several Lewis places named after him. One such place is a shieling in the parish of Lochs, possibly suggesting a site where his cattle grazed. Another is the stack at Mangersta, where {{he is said to}} have hidden from authorities. According to Matheson, tradition current in the 1970s stated that Dòmhnall Cam was the least formidable of his brothers, but what he lacked in physical strength he made up in grim determination. He often appears in stories as being a fierce fighter with a short temper.|$|E
50|$|Cnut died in 1035, and Harthacnut succeeded him as king of Denmark. It {{is unclear}} whether he was {{intended}} to have England as well, {{but he was too}} much occupied in defending his position in Denmark to come to England to make good any claim. It was therefore decided that his elder half-brother Harold Harefoot should act as regent, while Emma held Wessex on Harthacnut's behalf. In 1036 Edward and his brother Alfred separately came to England. Emma later claimed that they came in response to a letter forged by Harold inviting them to visit her, but historians believe that she probably did invite them in an effort to counter Harold's growing popularity. Alfred was captured by Godwin, Earl of Wessex who turned him over to Harold Harefoot. He had Alfred blinded by forcing <b>red-hot</b> <b>pokers</b> into his eyes to make him unsuitable for kingship, and Alfred died soon after {{as a result of his}} wounds. The murder is thought to be the source of much of Edward's later hatred for the Earl and one of the primary reasons for Godwin's banishment in autumn 1051. Edward is said to have fought a successful skirmish near Southampton, and then retreated back to Normandy. He thus showed his prudence, but he had some reputation as a soldier in Normandy and Scandinavia.|$|R

Becker ties up Karl to a rack to be slowly stretched to death while he ties up Peter and begins torturing him with <b>red-hot</b> <b>pokers.</b> As Eva struggles to untie herself, she accidentally drops the amulet onto Fritz's dead body. A few drops of Eva's blood from her wounds lands on Fritz's body and the amulet itself. Suddenly, the Baron starts to suffer terrible pains as Fritz rises out of his coffin. The secret of how to destroy the Baron finally comes to light: the Baron's victims all rise from their coffins, empowered by the magic amulet which is powered up with blood of the ones who raised him (either Eva or Peter). The undead victims, who include Fritz, Dortmundt, Christine, the doctor, the grave digger, {{and all of the}} other people who he killed, attack the Baron and rip him apart from limb to limb. Eva manages to untie both Peter and Karl, and the wounded, blood-covered trio flee from the dungeon, and into Karl's car where they drive away from the castle, while the sounds of the Baron's dying screams and Elizabeth Holly's laughter echo into the night air.|$|R

5|$|Controversy rapidly {{surrounded}} Edward's death. With Mortimer's {{execution in}} 1330, rumours began to circulate that Edward {{had been murdered}} at Berkeley Castle.

Most historians now dismiss this account of Edward's death, querying the logic in Edward's captors murdering him in such an easily detectable fashion.|$|R
6000|$|And now, I see a {{wonderful}} row of little lights rise smoothly {{out of the}} ground, before a vast green curtain. Now, a bell rings--a magic bell, which still sounds in my ears unlike all other bells--and music plays, amidst a buzz of voices, and a fragrant smell of orange-peel and oil. Anon, the magic bell commands the music to cease, and the great green curtain rolls itself up majestically, and The Play begins! The devoted dog of Montargis avenges {{the death of his}} master, foully murdered in the Forest of Bondy; and a humorous Peasant with a red nose and a very little hat, whom I take from this hour forth to my bosom as a friend (I think he was a Waiter or an Hostler at a village Inn, but many years have passed since he and I have met), remarks that the sassigassity of that dog is indeed surprising; and evermore this jocular conceit will live in my remembrance fresh and unfading, overtopping all possible jokes, unto the end of time. Or now, I learn with bitter tears how poor Jane Shore, dressed all in white, and with her brown hair hanging down, went starving through the streets; or how George Barnwell killed the worthiest uncle that ever man had, and was afterwards so sorry for it that he ought to have been let off. Comes swift to comfort me, the Pantomime--stupendous Phenomenon!--when clowns are shot from loaded mortars into the great chandelier, bright constellation that it is; when Harlequins, covered all over with scales of pure gold, twist and sparkle, like amazing fish; when Pantaloon (whom I deem it no irreverence to compare in my own mind to my grandfather) puts <b>red-hot</b> <b>pokers</b> in his pocket, and cries [...] "Here's somebody coming!"
