5|$|Writing poetry was a {{means of}} passing the time for {{soldiers}} of many nations, and the horses of World War I figured prominently in several poems. In 1982, Michael Morpurgo wrote the novel War Horse, about a cavalry horse in the war. The book was later adapted into a successful play of the same name, and also into a screenplay, with the movie, released on December 25, 2011 in the United States. In January 2010, the History Channel aired a documentary entitled The <b>Real</b> <b>War</b> Horse, depicting the horses of World War I.|$|E
25|$|The {{exercises}} {{were not}} without critics {{as to whether}} they accurately represented <b>real</b> <b>war</b> situations. A number of captains were criticised for not taking the rules sufficiently seriously, continuing to fight their ships after they should have considered themselves sunk or captured. Vice-Admiral Batsch of the German navy published a critique of the 88 and 89 exercises, arguing that the objectives of the admirals had become reversed from those of a <b>real</b> <b>war,</b> where coastal raids would follow opportunistically to main fleet engagements, rather than being main aims in themselves. In the '89 exercise the enemy fleet started at a 25% disadvantage, but steady attrition during raiding reduced it to 43% the size of the British fleet, so that any chance of a decisive victory steadily diminished. The result of dividing forces had been that they were picked off one by one. Nevertheless, the exercises served to improve morale for the sailors concerned, and to raise considerable interest amongst the general public in naval affairs.|$|E
25|$|From 22 September, Louis XIV seized all Dutch ships {{present in}} French ports, totalling {{about a hundred}} vessels, {{apparently}} proving that <b>real</b> <b>war</b> with France was imminent, though Louis had meant {{it to be a}} mere warning. On 26 September the powerful city council of Amsterdam decided to officially support the invasion. On 27 September Louis crossed the Rhine into Germany to attack Philippsburg and William began to move the Dutch field army from the eastern borders, where it had trained on the Mookerheide, to the coast, even though most of the new mercenaries had not yet arrived.|$|E

25|$|During {{the years}} of perestroika and glasnost, the Soviet historiography began to write new views of its history. Rendition of Winter War studies had its {{breakthrough}} when the Soviet historian Mikhail Semiryaga wrote an article for the weekly magazine Ogoniok in 1989. It {{was the first time}} the public read that the Winter War was a <b>real</b> <b>war,</b> not just a conflict, and that the Soviet government had had to deploy a large number of men and amount of matériel. Furthermore, Semiryaga wrote that the Soviets began their troop deployments in the spring of 1939. Later he wrote an article in which he revealed that the goal of the Red Army was not just to secure Leningrad, but to conquer the whole of Finland.|$|E
500|$|Scotland {{travelled}} to {{the region}} to investigate the disappearance of a fellow journalist who was {{thought to have been}} detained by Croatian Serb forces and assist her. His death in the line of duty, while seeking to help a fellow reporter, {{had a significant impact on}} the German media and German public opinion. Scotland's death reinforced the image of the conflict as a <b>real</b> <b>war</b> where no rules were obeyed. Spurred on by his death, Munich-based journalists established the [...] "Journalists help Journalists" [...] (...) association in 1993 to help reporters the way Scotland had intended when he was killed. Scotland's death also provided the impetus to establish German section of Reporters Without Borders in 1994.|$|E
500|$|Apart {{from the}} very real human {{suffering}} of the Melanesian troops killed or wounded at Bita Paka, the reduction in German prestige due to the capture of German New Guinea, and the economic and property losses experienced by some German colonists during the occupation, the battle ultimately held little significance for Germany either. The fighting yielded few tactical lessons given the very different nature of the fighting there {{to that of the}} mass industrialised warfare which both the Germans and Australians experienced in Europe. Meanwhile, just as many Australians felt that [...] "the <b>real</b> <b>war</b> was in Europe", so would have most Germans as the campaign became subsumed by the global conflict of the First World War.

With the death of the Swedish king, one of the major obstacles to peace was out of the way; in April the Treaty of Oliva was signed with the Allies (Poland, Austria and Brandenburg). However, the Danes were not keen on peace after their recent success. After further concessions, the Dutch released the blockade on Landskrona, allowing the Swedish fleet out in the Øresund strait and blockade Copenhagen. Danish diplomacy soon got the Dutch back on their side again, and <b>real</b> <b>war</b> between Sweden and the Dutch Republic seemed imminent. The French and English intervened in favor of the Swedes and the situation was again teetering {{on the edge of a}} major conflict.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway {{presents}} matadors as heroic characters {{dancing in}} a bullring. He considered the bullring as war with precise rules, {{in contrast to}} the messiness of the <b>real</b> <b>war</b> that he, and by extension Jake, experienced. Critic Keneth Kinnamon notes that young Romero is the novel's only honorable character. [...] Hemingway named Romero after Pedro Romero, an 18th-century bullfighter who killed thousands of bulls in the most difficult manner: having the bull impale itself on his sword as he stood perfectly still. [...] Reynolds says Romero, who symbolizes the classically pure matador, is the [...] "one idealized figure in the novel." [...] Josephs says that when Hemingway changed Romero's name from Guerrita and imbued him with the characteristics of the historical Romero, he also changed the scene in which Romero kills a bull to one of recibiendo (receiving the bull) in homage to the historical namesake.|$|E

It seems pains were taken to make the setting look like Afghanistan or Iraq with the other actors looking as close to real military personnel as possible." [...] Lamb criticized the video's lack of sensitivity and respect for using an army and weapons of destruction to glamorize war, saying, [...] "Does Def Jam, Rihanna's label, need to be reminded that this comes on the heels of sadly sending off an additional 30,000 troops from our country to <b>real</b> <b>war?</b> In my mind {{this is one of the}} most tasteless, offensive moves by a major pop artist in recent memory." ...|$|E

500|$|Jonathan Derbyshire, culture {{editor of}} the New Statesman called it [...] "a {{remarkable}} novel" [...] and its protagonist [...] "a convincing witness to the defining moral catastrophe of the 20th century." [...] Tim Martin of The Telegraph praised the novel for not being just another story about banality of evil: [...] "it is a magnificently artificial project in character construction, a highly literary and provocative {{attempt to create a}} character various enough to match the many discontinuous realities of the apocalyptic Nazi world-view. The result is a sprawling, daring, loose-ended monster of a book, one that justifies its towering subject matter by its persistent and troubling refusal to offer easy answers and to make satisfying sense." [...] Writing for The Guardian, British author James Lasdun criticized the novel for [...] "some large flaws" [...] such as its main character, [...] "a ghoul belonging more to the fictional universe of, say, Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho", and provocative use of anachronisms, but called it a [...] "monumental inquiry into evil. To say that it falls short of Melville's visionary originality (and lacks, also, the breadth and vitality of Tolstoy, despite the claims of some reviewers) is hardly a criticism. It's a rare book that even invites such comparisons, and for all its faults, for all its problematic use of history, The Kindly Ones does just that." [...] In The Spectator, British journalist and biographer Patrick Marnham wrote: [...] "Dr Aue cannot be brought to trial because he does not exist; on the other hand, he can give us something even more valuable than vengeance, something that no <b>real</b> <b>war</b> criminal can manage, and that is total honesty." [...] Harvard University's English studies' Professor Leland de la Durantaye wrote that The Kindly Ones [...] "is indeed about cruelty and evil in the way that morality plays are, but it is also about evil in history, the weaving together of hundreds of objectives, millions of people, into an ensemble so vast, diverse, and ever-changing that even a well-placed and sharp-sighted observer cannot fully grasp it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Indeed, {{the fear}} of war between the Soviets and the West reached a high point after the coup. On 5 March, General Lucius D. Clay sent an {{alarming}} telegram from Berlin that advised of its likelihood: [...] "Within the last few weeks, I have felt a subtle change in Soviet attitude which I cannot define but which now gives me a feeling that it may come with dramatic suddenness". General Omar Bradley later wrote that when he read Clay's [...] "lugubrious assessment" [...] in Washington he was [...] "lifted right out of [...] chair", and George F.

In practice, Marxism has meant bloody terrorism, deadly purges, lethal prison camps and murderous forced labor, fatal deportations, man-made famines, extrajudicial executions and fraudulent show trials, outright mass murder and genocide." [...] He writes that in practice the Marxists saw {{the construction of}} their utopia as [...] "a war on poverty, exploitation, imperialism and inequality – and, as in a <b>real</b> <b>war,</b> noncombatants would unfortunately {{get caught in the}} battle. There would be necessary enemy casualties: the clergy, bourgeoisie, capitalists, 'wreckers', intellectuals, counterrevolutionaries, rightists, tyrants, the rich and landlords. As in a war, millions might die, but these deaths would be justified by the end, as in the defeat of Hitler in World War II. To the ruling Marxists, the goal of a communist utopia was enough to justify all the deaths." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, General Martin Luther Agwai, head of {{the joint}} African Union – United Nations Operation, said {{the war was over}} in the region, {{although}} low-level disputes remained.

This perspective is contradicted by reports which indicate that violence continues in Darfur while peace efforts have been stalled repeatedly. Violence between Sudan's military and rebel fighters has beset Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states since disputed state elections in May 2011, an ongoing humanitarian crisis that has prompted international condemnation and U.S. congressional hearings. In 2012, tensions between Sudan and South Sudan reached a boiling point when the Sudanese military bombed territory in South Sudan, leading to hostilities over the disputed Heglig (or Panthou) oil fields located along the Sudan-South Sudan border.|$|E

After dinner, Jerome began shooting down toy soldiers with a toy cannon and Wells joined in to compete.|$|R
2500|$|Although the UK and France {{declared}} war on Germany on 3 September, little movement {{took place on the}} western front. The offensive in the West that the Poles understood they were promised was not materializing, and, according to Norman Davies, it was not even immediately feasible or practical. Because of the Western inaction, of the secret protocols of the German-Soviet treaty, and other factors including its own poor intelligence, the Polish government was initially not fully aware of the degree of the country's isolation and the hopelessness of its situation. The combined British and French forces were strong in principle, but not ready for an offensive for a number of reasons. The few limited air raids attempted by the British were ineffective and caused losses of life and equipment. Dropping propaganda leaflets had henceforth become their preferred course of action, to the dismay of the Polish public, which was led to believe that a <b>real</b> <b>war</b> on two fronts and a defeat of the Third Reich were coming.|$|E
2500|$|Beatty became Rear-Admiral Commanding the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron on 1 March 1913. Beatty {{was late}} taking up his new post, {{choosing}} not to cut short a holiday in Monte Carlo. On his eventual arrival, he set about drafting standing orders regarding how the squadron was to operate. He noted, [...] "Captains...to be successful must possess, in a marked degree, initiative, resource, determination, and no fear of accepting responsibility". He went on [...] "...as a rule instructions will be of a very general character {{so as to avoid}} interfering with the judgement and initiative of captains...The admiral will rely on captains to use all the information at their disposal to grasp the situation quickly and anticipate his wishes, using their own discretion as to how to act in unforeseen circumstances..." [...] The approach outlined by Beatty contradicted the views of many within the navy, who felt that ships should always be closely controlled by their commanding admiral, and harked back to reforms attempted by Admiral George Tryon. It is argued that Tryon had attempted to introduce greater independence and initiative amongst his captains, which he believed would be essential in the confusion of a <b>real</b> <b>war</b> situation, but had ironically been killed in an accident caused by captains rigorously obeying incorrect but precise orders issued by Tryon himself.|$|E
2500|$|When Britain and France {{went to war}} in 1793, the U.S. {{was caught}} in the middle. The 1778 treaty of {{alliance}} with France was still in effect, yet most of the new country's trade was with Britain. War with Britain became imminent in 1794, after the British seized hundreds of American ships that were trading with French colonies. Madison believed that the United States was stronger than Britain, and that a trade war with Britain, although risking a <b>real</b> <b>war</b> by that government, would probably succeed, and allow Americans to assert their independence fully. Great Britain, he charged, [...] "has bound us in commercial manacles, and very nearly defeated the object of our independence." [...] According to Varg, Madison discounted the more powerful British military when the latter declared [...] "her interests can be wounded almost mortally, while ours are invulnerable." [...] The British West Indies, Madison maintained, could not live without American foodstuffs, but Americans could easily do without British manufactures. He concluded, [...] "it is in our power, in a very short time, to supply all the tonnage necessary for our own commerce". Washington avoided a trade war and instead secured friendly trade relations with Britain through the Jay Treaty of 1794. Madison's harsh and unsuccessful opposition to the treaty led to a permanent break with Washington, ending a long friendship. The debate over the Jay Treaty would serve as the catalyst for the creation of the country's first political parties.|$|E
