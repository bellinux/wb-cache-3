A very similar oil is made in Africa from G. abyssinica. The oil is used as an {{extender}} for sesame oil, which it resembles, {{as well as for}} making soap, in addition to its role as an illuminant, and many other uses.|$|E
5000|$|Guizotia abyssinica is an erect, stout, {{branched}} annual herb, {{grown for}} its edible oil and seed. Its cultivation {{originated in the}} Ethiopian highlands, and has spread {{to other parts of}} Ethiopia. Common names include: noog/nug (Ethio-Semitic ኑግ nūg); niger, nyger, nyjer, or Niger seed; <b>ramtil</b> or ramtilla; inga seed; and blackseed, khursani in marathi Gujitil in Assamese, [...] "Huchellu" [...] and [...] "Gurellu" [...] in Kannada, [...] "Karala" [...] or [...] "Karale (कारळे)" [...] in Marathi.|$|E
40|$|Introduction There {{are about}} 160 species in Brassica genus, which are mostly annuals and biennials. The plants in this genus have {{potential}} for fodder uses. The progress in plant breeding science has produced new crop varieties {{for oil and}} forage usages. Perko varieties are derived from crosses between tetraploid plants of winter rapeseed (Brassica napus L. Var. napus) and Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris L. var. sensulato). The new plants are superior to their parents from various aspects. Buko varieties are new amphiploid plants obtained by crossing between tetraploid winter rapeseed, Chinese cabbage and turnips (Brassica campestris L. var. Rapa). Oilseed radish with scientific name (Raphanus sativus L.) is a genus of the Brassica and consumption, oil, green manure, feed and fodder (24). This plant in many countries, including Canada, is cultivated in gardens as cover crop. Oilseed radish grows fast in the cool seasons. <b>Ramtil</b> (Guizotia abyssinica) belongs to the Compositae family, Phasilia (Phaceli atanacetifolia L.) belongs to Boraginaceae family and clover is from Fabaceae family that is grown for feeding purposes. Materials and Methods A field experiment was conducted from 2011 to 2012 in the Karezan region of Ilam, Iran (42 º 33 ′N, 33 º 46 ′E) on a silty-clay with low organic carbon (1. 26...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out under {{temperate}} climate condition of Ilam province, Iran, during 2012 - 2013 growing season to determine the suitable crop rotation for enhancing nitrogen uptake, utilization, and use efficiency of wheat. A two factor experiment was laid out as split plot arrangement (RCBD) with four replications. The main plots consisted of 6 pre-sowing plant treatments (control, Perko, Buko, Clover, Oilseed radish and combination of three plants <b>Ramtil,</b> Phaselia, Clover), and sub-plots were allocated to four levels of nitrogen fertilizer (Zero, conventionally recommended fertilizer, 50 % lower and 50 % higher than the recommended fertilizer). Results showed that nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), nitrogen uptake efficiency (NUpE), nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUtE) and nitrogen efficiency ratio (NER) in wheat were significantly affected by crop rotation and nitrogen fertilizer and their interaction. The lowest and highest nitrogen use efficiencies were achieved in oilseed radish-wheat and fallow-wheat rotations. The greatest nitrogen use efficiency in oilseed radish-wheat was due to high utilization efficiency of nitrogen in the rotation. The greatest and smallest nitrogen utilization efficiencies (NUtE) were observed in oilseed radish-wheat and fallow-wheat rotations, respectively. Perko-wheat rotation with application of nitrogen at the conventional level for wheat brings about an acceptable economic yield and high nitrogen uptake and use efficiency {{and seems to be}} advantageous to other rotations...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of new forage brassica plants were studied in Ilam, Iran, during 2012 - 2014 {{in a field}} experiment using a randomized complete block design with four replications. The treatments included, different forage crops Perko, Buko, Oilseed radish, Berseem clover, and the combination of three plants <b>Ramtil,</b> Phaselia, and Clover. The Studied traits consisted of plant height, forage yield, total dry weight, protein content, protein yield, the yield of digestible protein, percent organic carbon (before and after planting), the percentage of nitrogen in the soil (before and after planting). According to the combined analysis of variance, {{the results showed that}} there were significant difference in terms of plant height, total dry weight, forage yield and percentage of organic carbon of soil after planting, protein content, protein yield, the yield of digestible protein. The higher forage yield belonged to Buko, Perko and Oilseed radish, with 69, 938 - 65, 168 and 63, 451 kg ha- 1, respectively, and the lowest biological yield was observed for Berseem clover with 31298 kg ha- 1. The higher total dry weight was observed for Perko (6371. 5 kg ha- 1) and the lowest dry matter yield belonged to Berseem clover 4408 kg ha- 1. The highest and the lowest plant height of were observed in Buko (54. 6 cm) and Clover (33. 95 cm), respectively. The highest and the lowest protein percentage were found for Buko (24. 46 %) and clover (18. 72 %), respectively. The highest and the lowest digestible amount of protein were achieved in Buko (1203 kg ha- 1) and clover (592. 3 kg ha- 1), respectively. The highest and the lowest soil organic carbon percentage after planting of cultivars were observed in Buko (1. 71 %) and oilseed radish (1. 25 %), respectively. The least increase in the percentage of organic carbon was observed for clover. Overall, new forage cultivars of the Brassica genus, showed significant superiority over Berseem clove...|$|E
