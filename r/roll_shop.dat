40|$|Today’s {{production}} processes {{are more and}} more optimized to be competitive. The production demands are increased for speed and quality. These increased demands do not pass the roll shops in the steel industry. In the <b>roll</b> <b>shop</b> periodically the rolls from the rolling mill are checked for imperfections. The imperfections are detected by special inspection systems. Improving the inspection systems can speed up the overall process significantly in the <b>roll</b> <b>shop.</b> The request for an improved inspection system results in a new generation inspection system. This inspection system should measure more signals {{at the same time and}} process the signals faster. To achieve this result the measurements are digitalized and processed in parallel on a FPGA. Speed and quality demands are also asked from the engineers by designing and maintanance of the inspection system. In this thesis a High-Level Synthesis tool is selected to implement the mathematical model of the inspection system. The tool selection is done based on a comparison between three HLS tools, namely: CatapultC, ROCCC and Compaan. For this implementation Compaan is the most promising one. Compaan is able to split the data streams processing in concurrent systems with distributed memories. With Compaan as development tool the main part of the mathematical model is implemented in four months. This is four times faster than the preceding implementation.

40|$|Abstract. The {{surface of}} work rolls and back up rolls is worn out during hot rolling of heavy plates and strip steel because of micro {{structural}} changes and induced crack propagation. After {{the operation of}} the rolls in the mills, the surface will be regenerated by the following grinding process in the roll shops. This provides sufficient surface conditions for the next set in service. The roll shops of ThyssenKrupp Stahl will be gradually equipped with modern eddy current and ultrasonic techniques. The procedure for the implementation of these NDE techniques into the <b>roll</b> <b>shop</b> of a heavy plate mill will be described exemplarily. In the first step after bringing the installations into operational use, the former practice skills should be considered within the calibration of the systems. For this, the workmanship is documented by a statistical analysis of the signals obtained by these two non-destructive testing devices. Accordingly, the sensitivity of the operating systems is determined by comparing signals obtained from artificial notches with signals obtained from roll damages. These results are confirmed by taking micrographic examinations of the roll surface. After accurate confirmation {{of the relationship between the}} obtained signals and the condition of the rolls, the systems are fully set in service and integrated into {{the operation of the}} <b>roll</b> <b>shop.</b> This methodical approach contributes to a considerable benefit during the operation of the rolls since their service life is prolonged significantly. 1...|$|E

40|$|For every mill {{the ideal}} roll can be {{considered}} as one {{that can be used in}} a mill stand indefinitely. Unfortunately for the roll user, such ideal rolls do not exist. One major reason for work roll changes (planned or unplanned) is "wear". In the context of cold rolling and temper rolling, "wear" primarily refers to loss of roughness and/or surface texture. Another limitation to roll performance is the fact that mill incidents - minor as well as major incidents - inflict damage on the work rolls, requiring redressing in the <b>roll</b> <b>shop.</b> If a major defect is present in a forged roll, e. g. due to a mill incident, catastrophic roll failure may occur in a violent, explosive manner. Improvement of the value-in-use of a work roll implies a superior wear resistance, a superior damage resistance, and elimination of the safety risks associated with explosive roll failures. In order to deal with this in a concerted R&D approach, a consortium of two roll users in the steel industry, a leading roll manufacturer, a high-tech supplier of roll damage detection equipment, and specialised research institutes have joined forces. Cold rolling trials have been performed, using pilot mills as well as industrial mills, with both novel forged HSS work rolls and conventional forged 3 - 5 %Cr steel work rolls. Separate trials have been designed to focus on either the aspect of roughness evolution or damage resistance. Complementary data from various laboratory tests and industrial mill and <b>roll</b> <b>shop</b> data have been collected. Models have been developed for damage evolution in a roll, and for roughness evolution of the roll surface. In addition, novel non-destructive detection systems and sensors have been designed and tested. This paper provides a concise overview of the results achieved. © EDP Sciences...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} is {{initiated by the}} findings that the coating variation of light weight coated LWC paper is in synchronization with a backing roll of a coating station. The frequency of the largest peak in the quality variation spectrum corresponds to the oval geometry of a backing roll, but no such a phenomenon has been measured in a <b>roll</b> <b>shop.</b> It was realized {{that the cause of}} the research problem could be the change in the geometry as a function of running speed. First, a theoretical study is carried out by building a single cross-section FE model of a backing roll using measured wall thickness data with systematic thickness variation. Only the main variation component is used. The analysis shows the wall thickness variation is a possible cause for a dynamic geometry change. For a more detailed study, a cylindrical FE model is created, and the measured wall thickness matrix is used to define the inner surface nodes. The analysis shows dynamic geometry change although the geometry is more complex due to fixed end plates. A device is developed to measure the dynamic geometry change. The device is calibrated using a multi-lobe disc as a reference standard. Using the principles of GUM (Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurements) it is shown that the expanded uncertainty U of the device is less than two micrometers in a typical measuring case. A full scale backing roll is used as a test roll in laboratory experiments. The measurements of the roll show similar behavior that was observed in the FE analyses. The magnitude of the change in simulation was about 20 % lower than in the measurements. It is concluded that enhancements in the FE model and the processing of the measuring data would lead to more consistent results. The significance of the phenomenon is studied using a quite large sample of backing rolls at paper mills in Finland and abroad. The measured rolls are classified according to different generations of manufacturing processes and materials used. The study showed that dynamic geometry change is a common phenomenon in industry. A correlation analysis between machine direction quality variations of LWC paper and the dynamic behavior of a backing roll shows a very strong correlation. In many cases, the dynamic geometry change is the most significant single component causing run-out, and thus the main single cause for the harmonic paper quality variation. During the research, some methods were used for maintenance purposes to improve the dynamic behavior of backing rolls. According to the measurements, the used maintenance methods proved to be useful...|$|E

Back up rolls (BUR) suffer from mechanical pressure cracks in contact stress zones due to excess work hardening. These cracks move downwards through cyclic loading, if not detected and removed by grinding, and cause roll spalls or catastrophic failures.

40|$|Yawata Steel Works, {{which now}} belongs to Nippon Steel Corporation, {{was the first}} large scale {{integrated}} steel making enterprise in Japan. As an enterprise owned by the Japanese Government, it started {{iron and steel making}} in 1901. The enterprise grew in size so rapidly that in the 1920 s it employed about 30, 000 workers. The Yawata Steel Works consisted of a huge complex of numerous mills. The total number of blast furnace mills, steel making mills, <b>roll</b> mills, repair <b>shops,</b> railway shops and other mills were counted as more than one hundred in the late 1920. Although individual mills had to follow a primitive production control and accounting requirements imposed by the top management, the execution of the business was largely left to mill managers. It {{is important to note that}} each mill was more or less independent of the control by the top management in its implementation of labor management. Until early 1910 s, most of the labor management in Yawata had been carried out by the mill managers who were responsible for recruitment, discharge, promotion, and pay raise of their workers. For the whole period, there existed a central labor office which was in charge of labor management in general. But the resources of the office were so limited that tasks it could perform were mainly confined to enactment of by-laws which stipulated codes of labor conditions for operators and day laborers. In order to compensate for the weak position of the central labor office and to strengthen the control over individual mills, the top management with the assistance of the central labor office made use of a stratified personnel system. While the status of top and middle management which included executive officers, engineers and assistant engineers in its fold was defined by the statutes and governmental decrees, the top management could decide the number and the status of the lower rank of supervisors. As there had always been a need with the rise of production in each mill to increase the number of lower ranks of supervisors, the top management and the central labor office could gain control over the activities of each mill through its policy as to supervisors. Thus, until the outbreak of the war in Europe, the role of the central labor office remained quite limited. But the economic boom which took place during and after the war changed the situation. The hectic economic activities all over Japan produced an acute labor shortage almost everywhere in Japan. The Yawata Steel Works was forced to raise the workers' pay, and the following inflationary pressures invigorated the workers' demand for better working conditions. After the short-lived unsuccessful strikes in February 1920, the top management implemented a series of reforms in labor management which were to change the role of the central labor offices. One of the reforms was an establishment of the works councils, the labor offices being responsible for its working. New supervisory classes mostly recruited from operators were created. The labor office began issuing a bi-monthly newspaper. As it was evident that each mill could do almost nothing in reacting to the workers' demand, the labor management by the central labor offices began to take the place of the management by individual mills. The economic depression following the post-war boom also contributed to the strengthening of the function of the central labor office. The need to raise productivity by way of restraining the increase of man-power necessarily limited the power of each mill in its recruitment activity. In case a mill manager wanted to increase the number of his workers, he was required to get a permission from the central labor office. The manning was no more regarded as a matter which only mill managers could handle. The central labor office could decide the number of workers which a mill could employ, move workers from one mill to another more easily, start productivity and safety campaigns which mobilized all the workers. The evidence as to the labor management shows that there was a clear-cut trend toward centralization within the Steel Works. But it will exaggerate the situation to say that there was no strong trend other than centralization. We cannot forget the countervailing trend of decentralization at this period. Accounting system was the case in point. In earlier period the top management controlled the activities of each mill through a centralized accounting system, but in the 1920 s and 1930 s there developed an accounting system which put more responsibility for cost control on each mill. Even in the labor management, centralization and decentralization took place at the same time. While the central labor office was responsible in checking the working of the wage systems, each mill could invent and implement a local wage system as long as it was based on the general wage policy. In the productivity drive promoted by the central labor office, each mill set up a committee including staffs and workers in order to discuss the productivity measures. The centralization in the labor management of Yawata Steel Works is important in that it became an integral part of the policy of the top management to achieve a highly integrated state of production. Before the application of Taylorism and other production techniques on a large scale which began in 1950 s, there were few methods available to the top management in coordinating the activities of each mill. The labor management by the central labor office was one of those methods which could offer an effective means of coordination. The emergence of the new way of running a giant enterprise through the centralized labor management will be also of note in its connection with the fact that from the late 1930 s to 1950 s the Steel Works made use of the centralized labor management in mobilizing workers participation in war production effort and in post war reconstruction. After the Second World War the newly established labor union organizing operators of the Yawata Steel Works held joint consultation with the management. The issues discussed was status of operators, manning policy and pay rise, all of which the central labor office had dealt with before the war. It will not miss the point to say that the centralized labor management became an institutional basis on which post war industrial relations was constructed. ...|$|R
