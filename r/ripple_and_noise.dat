Generally BLDC motors have found wide applications such as: electrical vehicles, industries, home appliances, etc. There are many factors which cause torque <b>ripple</b> <b>and</b> acoustic <b>noise</b> in BLDC motors. The unbalanced motor has the major role in the creation of torque <b>ripple</b> <b>and</b> acoustic <b>noise.</b> There are many reasons to the imbalanced air gap, which is the most common fault in asymmetric rotors such as: impacts on the axle or shaft due to the lack of proper design, lack of proper casting or inaccuracy arises in the factory. However, the asymmetry in the rotor which is caused by an imbalanced air gap, causes the differences in air gap flux, so, the vertical and tangential forces will be unbalanced which leads to the production of vibration and acoustic noses.

Identifying atom positions requires appropriate resolution, the ability to separate distinct objects in images. With Cs corrected, the information limit of the TEM controls resolution. The OAM has demonstrated that a resolution of 0. 78 A is possible.

Recently, for application requiring high dynamic performance, direct torque control (DTC) is employed.

An optimized geometrical core constant integrated magnetics design procedure is proposed. Some auxiliary packaging design considerations are addressed. The converter ac analysis {{is divided into two}} parts to observe the individual small signal effect introduced by the ZVS switch and coupled inductor.

The converter ac model is obtained by substituting in the coupled inductor ac model to the uncoupled-inductor converter ac model. It is found both the dc coupled inductor zero current ripple condition and the ac converter transfer function response are affected by the turns ratio and the leakage inductance of the coupled inductor. Hence, the converter dc and ac designs are coupled by the coupled inductor operation. Experimental results of the dc and ac analysis of a ZVS converter with coupled inductor are shown.

However,those machines suffer from torque <b>ripple</b> <b>and</b> <b>noise</b> and vibration issues, which constitute an obstacleto the extension of their application domain. This paper presents the influence of thebandwidth of a current-hysteresis controller on an 8 / 6 SRM in terms of noise, vibration andharshness. Simulations in AMESim environment and measurements on a 15 kW test bench areperformed in transient state, based on continuous variation of the hysteresis bandwidth. Phasecurrents, acoustic noise and radial vibrations are measured without and with load, allowing forcomparison of hysteresis-band-frequency plots. This transient state approach enables showingthe evolution of {{a part of the}} frequency components with hysteresis bandwidth and distinguishingthem from other components linked to speed or to structural behaviour of the motor. Resultsshow that the current chopping by means of a hysteresis controller generates broadband frequenciesin the phase currents that also appear in the vibration and sound pressure wave measurements. As the bandwidth increases, switching-related components are shifted towards lowerfrequencies, resulting in a higher excitation of the main resonance modes of the machine. Due tothe higher current ripple in the case of hard chopping mode, the influence of the bandwidth is ingeneral more important than in soft chopping mode. However, for the same bandwidth the rippleoccurs at much lower frequencies in the latter case and therefore more attention has to bepaid to possible interaction with the resonance frequencies. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{designer}} of the battery monitoring system faces {{the difficult task of}} choosing the technology that will allow the extraction of information for the state of health of the battery while the battery is online. For the purpose of assessing the battery internal ohmic value, some battery monitoring manufacturers inject AC signals in to the battery strings, while others periodically apply a load pulse. Unfortunately, those signals are not always welcomed by the battery user or battery manufacturer. The authors will present a passive method to measure and pinpoint a suspicious cell and extract battery performance information without injecting any signals to the battery by using the normally unwelcomed signals produced by charger/UPS equipment. Any AC power converter using the battery for the backup power source does inversely introduce the AC signals (often referred as the <b>ripple</b> <b>and</b> <b>noises)</b> across the DC link. The amplitude and frequency of these signals vary with UPS architecture.

The information should show performance down to individual cells without injecting any external signals to the battery link. The possibility of using the existing signals, in the form of ripple or white noise, will be discussed; however, AC signals across a battery are usually in low or very low amplitude; therefore a special noise elimination technique must be applied.

The source consist of the converter with IGBT switches, working with a principle of pulse-width modulation on programmed from 15 to 25 kHz frequency, and the high voltage sectioned transformer with the rectifier and additional capacitive filter. The transformer is placed in oil tank with silicon oil. The additional capacitive filter provides low <b>ripple</b> <b>and</b> <b>noise</b> level in working range of output currents. The design of the high-voltage transformer provides preservation of working capacity at voltage up to 100 kV.

40|$|Nowadays, {{switched}} reluctance motors (SRMs) {{attract more}} and more attention. The switched reluctance motor is simple to construct. It not only features a salient pole stator with concentrated coils, which allows earlier winding and shorter endturns than other types of motors, but also features a salient pole rotor, which has no conductors or magnets and is thus the simplest of all electric machine rotors. Simplicity makes the SRM inexpensive and reliable, and together with its high speed capacity and high torque to inertia ratio, makes it a superior choice in different applications. However, {{the control of the}} SRM is not an easy task. The motor's double salient structure makes its magnetic characteristics highly nonlinear. The motor flux linkage appears to be a nonlinear function of stator currents as well as rotor position, as does the generated electric torque. Apart from the complexity of the model, the SRM should be operated in a continuous phase-to-phase switching mode for proper motor control. The torque <b>ripple</b> <b>and</b> <b>noise</b> {{as a result of this}} commutation are the other two awkward issues which have to be tackled. All these make the control of the SRM a tough challenging. This thesis attempts to investigate the control of the switched reluctance motor from the motor's structure properties, model equations, operation principle, power converter topology and commutation algorithms to starting problem. Apart from the general introduction, this thesis focuses on speed control of an 8 / 6 SRM based on a simplified model. This simplified model limits the operation of the motor completely into its linear flux region. According to this model, two different commutation strategies, two-phase-exciting and single-phase- exciting methods, are discussed in details. It has been observed that, not like the two-phase-exciting, the turn-on angle for single-phase-exciting is not trivial for it will affect the system performance. Consequently, an optimized single-phase-exciting method is proposed. This method optimizes the whole system's performance from the point of view of power efficiency of the whole system. By optimizing the average power of the whole system, the motor's transient as well as steady-state performance for speed tracking can be improved simultaneously. Experimental results supported the proposed method. These results compared the influences of the two-phase-exciting strategy, optimized and non-optimized single-phase-exciting method on speed tracking capacity and stator currents. It showed that the optimized single-phase has almost the same speed tracking capacity as two-phase-exciting strategy, and the peak value of their stator currents is at the same level under the same condition. However, the performance in speed tracking by the non-optimized single-phase-exciting method is much worse than the other two under the same condition. The reason for this phenomenon has been analysed...|$|E

This pairs an engine powering the front wheels of the vehicle with an electric motor powering the rear wheels. This arrangement gave the flexibility of being able to operate the vehicle in an all-electric mode, an all biodiesel mode, or a combination of both to create maximum power at optimum effciency. For this functionality, a 1. 7 L CIDI engine running on Biodiesel B 20 fuel, powers the front wheels, and a 103 kW Magna motor powers the rear wheels. In order to power the motor, a high-voltage Energy Storage System was designed and integrated into the vehicle. Simulations and analysis were performed on the high-voltage DC bus to measure the <b>ripple</b> <b>and</b> <b>noise</b> effect produced due to the integrated motor assembly. Similar analysis was performed on the low-voltage system to analyze the dependence of the low-voltage system on the high-voltage system. The electrical implementation focused on harnessing the high-voltage system that would power the vehicle to give an all-electric drive range of 30 miles. Combined with the biodiesel engine, the vehicle gave a driving range of 370 miles, with an installed 10 gallon fuel tank. ^ Working on the high-voltage system calls for increased level of awareness and safety concern among the team members. To serve this purpose, a comprehensive set of protocols was developed. This covered all aspects from giving a basic understanding of the high-voltage system as a part of knowledge transfer to the team, member certifications to identify team members working on high-voltage, start-up and shut-down procedures, responsibilities, lock-out tag-out procedures, other general guidelines and personal protective equipment information. Following these protocols laid down the foundations for a safe and successful high-voltage work environment. ...|$|E

The advantages of those motors are high reliability, easy maintenance and good performance. The absence of permanent magnets and windings in rotor gives possibility to achieve very high speeds (over 10000 rpm) and turned SRM into perfect solution for operation in hard conditions like presence of vibrations or impacts.

40|$|PURPOSE: To examine {{development}} of sensitivity to auditory and visual temporal processes {{in children and}} the association with standardized measures of auditory processing and communication. Methods Normative data on tests of visual and auditory processing were collected on 18 adults and 98 children aged 6 - 10 years of age. Auditory processes included detection of pitch from temporal cues using iterated <b>rippled</b> <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> frequency modulation detection at 2 Hz, 40 Hz, and 240 Hz. Visual processes were coherent form and coherent motion detection. Test-retest data were gathered on 21 children. RESULTS: Performance on perceptual tasks improved with age, except for fine temporal processing (iterated <b>rippled</b> <b>noise)</b> <b>and</b> coherent form perception, {{both of which were}} relatively stable over the age range. Within-subject variability (as assessed by track width) did not account for age-related change. There was no evidence for a common temporal processing factor, and there were no significant associations between perceptual task performance and communication level (Children's Communication Checklist, 2 nd ed.; D. V. M. Bishop, 2003) or speech-based auditory processing (SCAN-C; R. W. Keith, 2000). CONCLUSIONS: The auditory tasks had different developmental trajectories despite a common procedure, indicating that age-related change was not solely due to responsiveness to task demands. The 2 -Hz frequency modulation detection task, previously used in dyslexia research, and the visual tasks had low reliability compared to other measures...|$|R
