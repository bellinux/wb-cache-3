In the 2011–12 season, he scored four goals in the first seven league games of the season which saw Hartlepool unbeaten leading to the club's <b>record</b> <b>start</b> to the season. Despite this, he was dropped by then manager Mick Wadsworth. He would go on to score three more goals for the club, his last being a cool finish in a 2–1 away to Bury. Boyd was {{released}} on 10 May 2012, along with nine other Hartlepool players, after spending 10 seasons with his home town club in two spells, which now sees him in the club's top 15 all time goalscorers and in the top 25 all time appearances.|$|E

500|$|For the record, André 3000 {{did most}} of the album's production, while Big Boi crafted hooks for the songs. André 3000 and {{producer}} Mr. DJ learned about beat creation through observing the members of Organized Noize at work, with Mr. DJ observing that despite André 3000's normally frugal lifestyle, his enthusiasm for production led him to splurge on costly recording equipment. At one point, André 3000 attempted singing and modifying his voice with pitch-correction equipment, but Big Boi warned him that this would alienate the group's urban audience. Another point of contention was the order of the track listing; Big Boi wanted to begin the album with [...] "Y'all Scared" [...] while André 3000 and the other producers and musicians wanted the first track to be [...] "Return of the G", preferring that the <b>record</b> <b>start</b> with a song with just the duo as opposed to one with multiple collaborators. Big Boi missed his flight to attend the album mastering session {{and by the time he}} arrived, the others had already settled on a cohesive track list for the record. After a long, heated discussion, Big Boi eventually agreed to opening the album with [...] "Return of the G". The album features the song [...] "West Savannah", which had been recorded during the Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik sessions, and was included on Aquemini to give listeners a [...] "bonus" [...] that had sentimental value for the duo, as well as to pay homage to Big Boi's family living in Savannah.|$|E

5000|$|The Braves {{lost five}} {{straight}} after their <b>record</b> <b>start</b> {{and by the}} end of May they were 27 - 20 and struggling. Some critics claimed the Braves were just living off the feat of their 13-game winning streak and that they were not as good as their record showed. Some of the critics even predicted that the Braves would drift slowly out of contention and would be out of the running by mid-summer. However, the Braves warmed up again, and they won 12 of their first 15 games in the month of June to jump to 16 games above the [...]500 mark at 39 wins and 23 losses. This gave evidence that the Braves's 13 - 0 start was not just a fluke of luck, and this silenced their critics - at least for a while.|$|E
50|$|Walton {{was named}} the NBA Western Conference Coach of the Month for games played in October and November, after guiding Golden State to a 19-0 start. He {{received}} the award despite technically being winless, since the Warriors' record was credited to Kerr. Since Kerr was still the head coach, NBA rules stipulated that the team's record under an interim coach be credited to the head coach, though the league considered altering the rule given Walton's case. However, the NBA permits an interim or acting head coach {{to be eligible for}} coaching awards. The Warriors extended their <b>record</b> <b>start</b> to 24-0. They were 39-4, the second-best start in league history, when Kerr resumed coaching full-time on January 22, 2016. Golden State ended the season an NBA-record 73-9, and Kerr was voted the NBA Coach of the Year. The coach had Walton, who coached more games during the season than Kerr (43-39), sit next to him on the podium at the award press conference. Walton finished ninth in the voting, receiving one second-place and two third-place votes.|$|E
