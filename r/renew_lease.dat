5000|$|Zanzibar Blue was a jazz club {{located in}} Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Known for its live jazz each night and for Sunday brunch, it branded itself as [...] "Philadelphia's Premier Jazz Club". Owned by {{brothers}} Robert and Benjamin Jr. Bynum, {{the club was}} located in Center City, Philadelphia below the Bellevue on the Avenue of the Arts. Zanzibar Blue opened in 1990 on 11th Street, between Spruce and Pine Streets and later moved to the Bellevue in 1996. The club closed on April 29, 2007, Robert Bynum stating [...] "we didn't {{think it was in}} our best interests to <b>renew</b> <b>lease.</b> We'd rather own our building than lease." [...] WJJZ, Philadelphia's smooth jazz radio station broadcast Sunday brunches from Zanzibar Blue, and performers such as Lou Rawls, Chick Corea and Chuck Mangione have played there.|$|E
5000|$|Soon, though, {{the paper}} {{would be forced}} to divorce itself from {{university}} funding in order to maintain editorial independence. In 1971, The Heights had a source bug a Board of Trustees meeting and printed a transcript of the meeting in the next issue, publicizing the University’s plans to fire Executive Vice President Fr. F.X. Shea. The administration pressed charges and had a restraining order put on the information. The paper's editors, Tom Sheehan and Michael Berkey, were arrested on charges of conspiring to obtain information by illegal means. They pleaded no contest and were assessed a small fine. Sheehan and Berkey believed they were acting {{in the best interest of}} the student body; one BC professor, Richard Hughes, described Sheehan as “a genuine crusader, passionately dedicated to his beliefs.” [...] The administration evicted The Heights, and cut off all funding after the incident. In the meantime, the newspaper operated out of the office of the Undergraduate Government of Boston College (UGBC) with borrowed money. Eventually, editors cut a deal with the administration to rent out McElroy 113, its current location. From 1971 onwards, The Heights would be an independent college newspaper, but would occasionally still clash with the values of the Jesuit University; in 1978, the University threatened not to <b>renew</b> <b>lease</b> after the paper published ads for an abortion clinic.|$|E
