500|$|PewDiePie {{formerly}} put out videos {{with a high}} frequency, {{something he}} scaled down in 2014. By early 2017, he had uploaded almost 3,500 videos to his channel, around 400 {{of which have been}} made private. In March 2017, PewDiePie commented that his channel was running on a daily output, stating, [...] " [...] a lot of challenges in doing daily content, it's stupid. I really shouldn't be doing it, I really should just fucking go back and upload twice a week or some shit, and then take a step back, but I still really, really love the daily challenge—the daily grind—of just being like, 'hey, I'm gonna make a video today, no matter what.'

500|$|... "Ice" [...] {{was also}} {{considered}} one of the best episodes of the first season by the production crew. According to Carter, Morgan and Wong [...] "just outdid themselves on this show, as did director David Nutter, who <b>really</b> <b>works</b> so hard for us. I think they wrote a great script and he did a great job directing it, and we had a great supporting cast". Nutter said: [...] "The real great thing about 'Ice' is {{that we were able to}} convey a strong sense of paranoia. It was also a great ensemble piece. We're dealing with the most basic emotions of each character, ranging from their anger to their ignorance and fear. It established the emotional ties these two characters have with each other, which is very important. Scaring the hell out of the audience was definitely the key to the episode". Anderson said that [...] "it was very intense. There was a lot of fear and paranoia going on. We had some great actors to work with".|$|E

500|$|In August 2013, after Joss Whedon, {{director}} of , announced that Hank Pym {{would not be}} Ultron's creator, Wright said Ultron was never {{a part of the}} story of Ant-Man, explaining that [...] "just to sort of set up what Ant-Man does is enough for one movie". Wright described Ant-Man as a stand-alone film but said it would fit into to the larger continuity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, explaining, [...] "I like to make it standalone because I think the premise of it needs time. I want to put the crazy premise of it into a real world, which is why I think Iron Man <b>really</b> <b>works</b> because it's a relatively simple universe; it's relatable. I definitely want to go into finding a streamlined format where you use the origin format to introduce the main character and further adventures can bring other people into it." [...] Wright also stated that pre-production for Ant-Man would begin in October and filming would begin in 2014. The next month, Disney moved the film's release date up to July 31, 2015.|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B" [...] rating. He {{felt that the}} episode worked {{extremely}} well on a visual and character-based level. Handlen felt that, because the show was [...] "often scariest when it’s implying, rather than flat out stating," [...] its [...] "mythology only <b>really</b> <b>works</b> as something just out of sight". For this reason, {{he felt that the}} episode mixed [...] "the compelling with the absurd" [...] with [...] "mixed results". Handlen concluded that the episode [...] "has its moment," [...] but is ultimately hurt {{by the fact that it}} refuses [...] "to come to any serious conclusions," [...] as well as [...] "the inherent limitations of the [...] form". Not all reviews were glowing. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris criticized the death scene of the Syndicate, noting that it was [...] "clumsily contrived, allowing [...] and Fowley to escape, but not because it makes sense, but because the show needs them to return at some point".|$|E
500|$|David Blackwell of Enterline Media {{thought that}} Sanctuary was an [...] "interesting concept", but felt {{the first six}} episodes were [...] "hit-or-miss". Of the series' use of green screen for sets, Blackwell stated [...] "{{sometimes}} it <b>really</b> <b>works</b> and sometimes the CGI sets could use improvement". He also felt that Amanda Tapping was convincing as a British scientist. In conclusion, Blackwell stated [...] "Sanctuary does {{take a while to}} kick in, but it is a very good series once the writers actually write something with depth." [...] Alex Walker of Den of Geek rated the first season three stars out of five, stating [...] "the acting and scripting is good, but Sanctuary lacks the wit and charm of the genre's top shows like Doctor Who and Battlestar Galactica. Also, the way some episodes alternate between fighting and exposition gives the impression of watching someone else play a videogame." [...] Walker also dubbed it a [...] "poor man's Buffy The Vampire Slayer, but said that it [...] "makes for [...] "agreeable early-evening viewing". Walker also believed that the DVD of the first season should really be for [...] "die-hard fans only".|$|E

500|$|Referring to {{the song}} as a [...] "junior varsity" [...] take on [...] "Man in the Mirror", Allison Stewart of Washington Post said [...] "as an {{indicator}} of the Bieb's awakening social consciousness, it's a good start." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix called the song a [...] "lovely testament to the power of prayer," [...] commenting that it was [...] "for True Believers, not just True Beliebers" [...] Calling it Bieber's [...] "Man in the Mirror" [...] moment, Newman also said while it did not have the [...] "staying power or resonance of the Michael Jackson classic," [...] she said the themes of how to effect change were the same. Lucy Jones of The Daily Telegraph noted the song as a recommended download from the album. Dan Savoie of Rockstar Weekly said the song [...] "is a more advanced lyric and shows a more political side to the young singer, but the gospel feel of the song <b>really</b> <b>works</b> with his voice." [...] Savoie went on to say [...] "The song just moved Bieber from the category of pop child star to responsible young man." [...] Monica Herrera of Billboard wrote that the song was [...] "a treacly but well-meaning ballad that taps into Bieber's spiritual beliefs." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{military}} {{ordered a}} flight test using liquid rather than solid fuel in early 1942. Upon the United States' {{entry into the}} Second World War in December 1941, the Group realized they could be drafted directly into military service if they failed to provide viable JATO technology for the military. Informed by their left-wing politics, aiding the war effort against Nazi Germany and the Axis powers was {{as much of a}} moral vocation to Parsons, Forman and Malina as it was a practical one. Parsons, Summerfield and the GALCIT workers focused on the task and found success with a combination of gasoline with red fuming nitric acid as its oxidizer; the latter, suggested by Parsons, was an effective substitute for liquid oxygen. The testing of this fuel resulted in another calamity, when the testing rocket motor exploded; the fire, containing iron shed fragments and shrapnel, inexplicably left the experimenters unscathed. Malina solved the problem by replacing the gasoline with aniline, resulting in a successful test launch of a JATO-equipped A-20A plane at the Muroc Auxiliary Air Field in the Mojave Desert. It provided five times more thrust [...] than GALCIT-27, and again reduced takeoff distance by 30%; Malina wrote to his parents that [...] "We now have something that <b>really</b> <b>works</b> and {{we should be able to}} help give the Fascists hell!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{title track}} [...] "Like It Like That" [...] was {{named one of}} the best singles of the year by both Rave Magazine and The Music Network. [...] "Art of Love" [...] was one of the twenty songs shortlisted for the 2010 APRA Song of the Year and [...] "All to Myself" [...] was shortlisted in 2011.

Sebastian also received nominations for Most Popular Australian Artist, Most Popular Australian Album, and Most popular Australian Single for [...] "Like It Like That" [...] and [...] "Art of Love. The album received many positive reviews. Paul Cashmere from Undercover Music wrote, [...] "By covering the classics on The Memphis Album Guy Sebastian discovered Guy Sebastian. He has drawn from that epitome and created what should be considered the debut album from the next phase of his career. [...] If The Memphis Album was Guy's initiation into becoming a Soul Man then Like It Like That is the graduation. Ara Jansen said in The West Australian, [...] "While there are plenty of pop elements to the album, Sebastian has finally and unabashedly unleashed his soul side. He's also done it with a big grin on his face as songs such as the wonderful [...] "Magic" [...] and the title track fizz like a soft drink on a hot day." [...] A reviewer for TV Central wrote, [...] "There's no doubt in anyone's mind that Sebastian's previous 'Memphis' record has inspired him like no other. From the first beat of his new album, it screams soul. It's bold, brash, but it works — it <b>really</b> <b>works.</b> It's {{probably one of the most}} cohesive albums from Sebastian to date. Listening from start to finish, you truly feel like you’ve experienced a musical journey. [...] The album, while not without its flaws, is definitely one of the most artistically complex records we've heard from an 'Australian Idol' artist to date. It's rich, multi-layered and engaging." ...|$|E

60|$|Yes--I thought--and this Art is the {{one form}} of human energy in the whole world, which <b>really</b> <b>works</b> for union, and destroys the {{barriers}} between man and man. It is the continual, unconscious replacement, however fleeting, of oneself by another; the real cement of human life; the everlasting refreshment and renewal. For, what is grievous, dompting, grim, about our lives {{is that we are}} shut up within ourselves, with an itch to get outside ourselves. And to be stolen away from ourselves by Art is a momentary relaxation from that itching, a minute's profound, and as it were secret, enfranchisement. The active amusements and relaxations of life can only rest certain of our faculties, by indulging others; the whole self is never rested save through that unconsciousness of self, which comes through rapt contemplation of Nature or of Art.|$|E

Whether it were the monarch himself, or some famous British admiral or general, or the governor of the province, or perchance the favorite daughter of the ship-owner, there the image stood above the prow, decked out in gorgeous colors, magnificently gilded, and staring the whole world out of countenance, as if from an innate consciousness of its own superiority. These specimens of native sculpture had crossed the sea in all directions, and been not ignobly noticed among the crowded shipping of the Thames and wherever else the hardy mariners of New England had pushed their adventures. It must be confessed that a family likeness pervaded these respectable progeny of Drowne's skill; that the benign countenance of the king resembled those of his subjects, and that Miss Peggy Hobart, the merchant's daughter, bore a remarkable similitude to Britannia, Victory, and other ladies of the allegoric sisterhood; and, finally, that they all had a kind of wooden aspect which proved an intimate relationship with the unshaped blocks of timber in the carver's workshop. But at least there was no inconsiderable skill of hand, nor a deficiency of any attribute to render them <b>really</b> <b>works</b> of art, except that deep quality, be it of soul or intellect, which bestows life upon the lifeless and warmth upon the cold, and which, had it been present, would have made Drowne's wooden image instinct with spirit.|$|E
