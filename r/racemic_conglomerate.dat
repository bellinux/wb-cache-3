40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} observed that coupling Viedma ripening with a seeded in situ metastable <b>racemic</b> crystal to <b>conglomerate</b> transformation leads to accelerated and complete deracemization: crystal transformation-enhanced deracemization. By {{means of a}} simple kinetic model, we show that the mechanistic pathway of this new process depends profoundly on the interplay between the crystal transformation and racemization processes, which in turn influence the nucleation process of the counter enantiomer. If the nucleation of the counter enantiomer is suppressed (e. g., by sufficiently fast racemization, low amount of racemic compound or gradual feed, low relative solubility between <b>racemic</b> compound and <b>conglomerate),</b> deracemization proceeds via a second order asymmetric transformation (SOAT) and is limited primarily by the dissolution rate of the racemic crystals and {{the growth rate of}} the preferred enantiomer crystals. Breakage and agglomeration accelerate the process, but contrary to conventional Viedma ripening, they are not essential ingredients to explain the observed enantiomeric enrichment. If the nucleation process of the counter enantiomer is not sufficiently suppressed, deracemization is initially controlled by the dissolution rate of the racemic crystals, but Viedma ripening is subsequently required to convert the conglomerate crystals of the counter enantiomer formed by nucleation, resulting in slower deracemization kinetics. In both cases, the combined process leads to faster deracemization kinetics compared to conventional Viedma ripening, while it autocorrects for the main disadvantage of SOAT, i. e., the accidental nucleation of the counter enantiomer. In addition, crystal transformation-enhanced deracemization extends the range of applicability of solid-state deracemization processes to compounds that form metastable racemic crystals...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{proposals}} for {{the origin of}} molecular homochirality, based {{on the effect of}} the weak neutral current (WNC) on enantiomers, and the amplification of the resultant parity-violating energy difference (PVED), are possibly flawed. The additive amplification of PVED in crystals and polymers (Yamagata hypothesis) cannot lead to detectable levels of optical activity, the original theory apparently overestimating PVED by a factor equal to Avogadro's number. An alternative theory based on the irreversible and spontaneous evolution of a dynamically fluctuating system is apparently impractical. However, the nonlinear amplification of PVED via autocatalytic polymerization may be possible as indicated by a simplified physico-chemical approach. This may also occur during crystallization and melting, and form the basis of the second order asymmetric transformation. (Thus, reported differences in the melting points of enantiomers in several cases may well be real). Also, the preponderance of <b>racemic</b> compounds over <b>conglomerates</b> may be based on the destabilization of the conglomerate by the action of the WNC on the crystalline lattice. The WNC may also be involved in the anomalous scattering of X-rays, which possibly arises from their circular polarization: the current theory would need to be revised accordingly...|$|R
40|$|The {{separation}} of chiral compounds is of large interest {{since most of}} the (bio-) organic molecules are chiral. Usually only one of the enantiomers shows the wanted properties with regard to therapeutic activities or metabolism, whereas the other enantiomer may be inactive or may even cause some undesired effects (Jacques et al., 1994). In recent years, besides the most commonly used classical resolution via formation of diastereomers, direct crystallization methods have become increasingly important. An attractive process is enantioselective preferential crystallization (Elsner et al., 2005) In a batch crystallizer <b>racemic</b> mixture of <b>conglomerate</b> forming systems tend to reach an equilibrium state in solution in which the liquid phase has racemic composition and the solid phase is 1 : 1 mixture of crystals of both enantiomers. However, before approaching this state, it is possible to preferentially produce just one of the enantiomers after seeding with homochiral crystals. Among all available crystallizer configurations the batch mode is obviously the easiest one. The principle of batch process is quite simple: the vessel is filled with a supersaturated solution of the racemate (enantiomers E p and E c). After addition of homochiral seeds e. g., merely E p is crystallizing within a limited time period. In order to gain the target enantiomer as a product of high purity, the process must be stopped before the nucleation of the undesired counter-enantiomer occurs (Lorenz et al., 2006). During this batch crystallization, the concentration of the desired enantiomer in the solution is decreasing, whereas the concentration of the counter-enantiomer remains constant. Based on analysis of these concentration profiles a more attractive and effective operation mode using two batch crystallizers coupled via liquid phase (see Fig. 1) has been studied (Ziomek et al., 2007). In each vessel one of both enantiomers is seeded and grows subsequently. An exchange of the crystal free liquid phases between the crystallizers leads to an increase of driving forces and consequently process productivity. The influence of important process variables like initial seed size distribution, exchange flow rates between crystallizers, and temperature has been analyzed experimentally using threonine-H 2 O as a model system. The influence of initial seed size distribution on the productivity and product quality will be shown. By varying size of particles used as a seeds, nucleation as well as growth kinetics are influenced. It will be demonstrated that by appropriate changing of free operating parameters the process performance can be controlled and improved. Parallel to the experimental analysis, a modeling approach will be also presented. References Jacques, J., Collet, A., Wilen, S.

The structures of these alkaloids were elucidated based on NMR spectroscopy, formation of an alkaloid-borane complex 40, as well as X-ray diffraction analysis. Concise partial syntheses of several new indole alkaloids isolated from Tabernaemontana, Alstonia, and Leuconotis species were carried out. These include, lirofoline A (44) from ibogaine (46), alstolucine A (91) from alstolucine B (94), and () -eburnamaline (96) from (+) -eburnamonine (98). Some transformations of the ring-opened Aspidosperma alkaloid, leuconolam (54) were investigated, inter alia, its reactions with base leading to enolate-mediated ring closure to yield the epimeric pentacylic meloscine-like compounds (74 and 76), its reaction with acids leading to transannular closure to the pentacyclic, doubly spirocyclic, 6, 7 -dehydroleuconoxine (63), or to the tetracyclic amino lactam-lactone (78). Bromination (Br 2 /CHCl 3) of leuconolam (54) was shown to proceed via a two-step sequence involving the intermediacy of 6, 7 -dehydroleuconoxine (63). Other reactions investigated include enolate-mediated -oxygenation, hydroboration, and reaction with trifluoroacetic acid. These studies led to concise semisynthesis of leuconoxine (56), and the new leuconoxine alkaloids, leuconodines A (67) and F (72). The results from these reactions also led {{to the realization that}} the original assignment of epi-leuconolam as 55 was incorrect. This was confirmed upon carrying out an X-ray diffraction analysis, which showed that ‘epi-leuconolam (55) ’ is in actual fact 6, 7 -dehydroleuconoxine (63). The original stereochemical/configurational assignments of the alkaloids scholaricine (114 a) and alstoumerine (118 a) were reinvestigated (NMR, derivatization, iii X-ray diffraction analysis) and the structures revised accordingly (to 114 b and 118 b, respectively). The revised structure of alstoumerine (118 b) was necessary for the structure elucidation of the new bisindole, lumutinine C (116). X-ray diffraction analyses were carried out for the macroline-macroline bisindole alkaloids, perhentinine (104) (via formation of the dimethyl diiodide salt of the ring E-cyclized hemiketal form, 104 b) and macralstonine (105), and the results were then applied to support the configurational assignment of C- 20 in the new Alstonia bisindoles, perhentidines AC (101  103). Andransinine (119) (in all probability an artifact derived from the alkaloid andranginine (120) during isolation of alkaloids from A. angustiloba and K. pauciflora), was found to exhibit polymorphism in the solid state, forming crystals with different crystal systems and space groups in different solvent systems.
