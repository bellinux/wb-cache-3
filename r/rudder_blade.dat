50|$|Designers such as Ian Oughtred have {{produced}} modern versions that incorporate many traditional features while addressing {{some of the}} drawbacks, in particular {{the replacement of the}} shallow, balanced rudder (which had a tendency to lead to wild and erratic steering in big following seas) with a more conventional transom-hung pivoting <b>rudder</b> <b>blade.</b> The Haiku design also has fully battened sails in an effort to improve windward performance. Oughtred offers the Haiku with either twin swinging centreboards, which give more interior room, at the expense of hydrodynamic efficiency, or a single central board, which takes up more space. At 30 feet long the Haiku is set up for a small family to cruise in sheltered waters.|$|E
50|$|Early long boats {{used some}} form of {{steering}} oar but by the 10th century the side rudder (called a steerboard, the source for the etymology for the word starboard itself) was well established. It consisted of a length of timber about 2.4 m long. The upper section was rounded to a diameter of about 150 mm. The lower blade was about 1.8 x 0.4 m. The steerboard on the Gokstad ship in the Viking Ship Museum in Oslo, Norway, is about 8 in wide, completely flat inboard and with about a 3 in maximum width {{at the center of}} the foil. The head of the rudder shaft had two square holes about 200 - 300 mm apart. When the rudder was in its normal position the tiller was inserted in the upper hole so that the tiller faced athwartwise. The shaft was attached to the gunwale by a U shaped joint. Near the stern, about halfway down the starboard topsides, was a rounded wooden block about 150 mm in diameter and 100 mm high, with a central hole for a rope. This corresponded to a hole in the midsection of the <b>rudder</b> <b>blade.</b> From the outside the rope ran through the blade, through the round block and topsides and was fastened inside the hull. The flexibility of the hemp rope allowed the blade to pivot. When beached or in shallow water the tiller was moved to the lower hole, the blade rope was slackened and the rudder head pulled up so the rudder could operate in shallow waters. Modern facsimiles are reported to steer quite well but require a very large amount of physical effort compared to the modern fore and aft tiller.|$|E

30|$|Cavitation erosion (CE), {{which is}} the {{predominant}} cause {{for the failure of}} overflow components, can be frequently observed in fluid machinery such as ship propellers and <b>rudder</b> <b>blades,</b> the cylinder liners of marine diesel, turbine impellers and various pumps. Corrosive ocean environment will accelerate the cavitation damage of the overflow parts of ships and drilling platforms. CE has become the central technical problems of the fluid equipment, which threatens the safety of the equipment, reduces the efficiency and increases the cost [1, 2].

40|$|Objectives] A {{comparative}} study of the rudder transmission vibration characteristics of electric drive and traditional hydraulic drive is carried out {{on the basis of}} a telescopic rudder transmission test bed. [Method] First,a study is made of the rotational angular velocity and the relationship between the vibration characteristics and load force of a rudder transmission driven by an electric servo motor. Next, the vibration characteristics of the mechanism under hydraulic drive and electric drive are compared and analyzed. [Results] The results indicate that the vibration intensity has a positive correlation with the <b>rudder</b> <b>blade</b> loading force and angular velocity at the zero balance position. Both the peak-to-peak values and root-mean-square values of the vibration acceleration of the electric drive are reduced by 40 % compared with the hydraulic drive, meaning that the electric drive can more effectively reduce the overall vibration of the rudder transmission. [Conclusions] The results provide a reference for the electrification of the rudder transmission...|$|E
40|$|It is {{observed}} that frequent rudder failures of Sri Lanka Navy’s fast attack craft which {{are equipped with}} conventional propulsion system. Therefore, it was unable to effectively utilize these craft for operational requirements in the Navy. In this research it was analyzed both recently failed fast attack craft rudder and existing rudder fabrication process {{in order to minimize}} this type of rudder failures in future. Analysis of failed rudder and the existing rudder fabrication process was done through macro/micro level inspection, chemical composition analysis and micro hardness testing of relevant materials. Analysis revealed that rudder failed from the welded joint where <b>rudder</b> <b>blade</b> connected to rudderstock and weakening of the weld joint during fabrication. The weld joint was weakened due to formation of intermetallic phases, carbide precipitation, porosities and hot cracks in the heat affected zone of the weld. Therefore, finally rudder was failed as a result of fatigue failure. Use of similar low carbon stainless steel with suitable welding electrodes to ensure final weld lies in austenite region with containing 4 % to 12 % ferrite in the weld could overcome this issue...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The rudder and {{steering}} gear {{is the most}} widely used ship maneuvering equipment. It consists of the maneuvering device, transmission mechanism, steering gear, steering mechanism and the <b>rudder</b> <b>blade.</b> MV "TANSUO HAO " is a scientific research ship of 30 years old. The scientific exploration missions require a very high accuracy of the ship’s course, so the ship has to constantly adjust her course and steer frequently. On that day, the duty officer found the steering gear failure to turn left in the rough sea condition. The engineering crew members had to make an emergency repair. It took plenty of time to locate the trouble of the steering gear in the repair process, because the valve plate deformation problem on the solenoid reversing valve was very hard to find out. By exploring the obscure steering gear failure reason and special troubleshooting process on MV "TANSUO HAO", this thesis provides some repair experience for the hydraulic system management and proposes flexible and patient failure analysis as well as some preventive maintenance measures against the problem. Foreword The hydraulic steering gear moves the rudder by hydraulic pressure. Its main components are hydraulic pump, hydraulic valve, hydraulic pipe, oil tank and 2 or 4 pcs hydraulic cylinders wit...|$|E

5000|$|The small dog then {{heads to}} the motor, but the engine won't start. The big dog lifts the anchor and uses the small dog's head to start the boat. As the dogs chase the {{duckling}} at super-sonic speed, the boat's <b>rudder</b> <b>blades</b> cut the water in half, then the land in half, sinking a tree. Continuing the chase in the boat on dry land, the blades proceed to turn a log, two trees and a rock mountain into a bridge, staircase and ladder, and Mount Rushmore, respectively. The duckling and the boat go into a hole in a tree, and goes through another tree that has a hole. The duckling passes between two trees with the big tree suddenly lifting the small tree before the boat can do something to it. After crossing a mudpit and squeezing between two other trees, the chase temporarily ends with the boat and everybody crashing into a rock and getting flattened. Now chasing the duckling on foot, they stop upon a [...] "Stop School Crossing" [...] sign with an actual schoolhouse crossing the road. Chasing the duckling into a forest, everything suddenly turns black and white, the trio having passed a sign indicating [...] "Technicolor Ends Here".

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{development}} of an autopilot system for leisure Yacht based on NMEA 2000 network and android platform. The developed system can operate both for manual steering and automatic navigation mode. In automatic steering mode, after manipulation of commands which are NMEA 0183 sentences by android platform, our system translates and sends the packets through NMEA 2000 network and the controller which is connected to NMEA 2000 network receives the commands and controls the boat?셲 rudder system automatically. The automatic steering mode will be achieved by cooperation of two controllersone for controlling the rudder system, and another for controlling the vessel?셲 heading. For this reason we have developed a PID controller with an adjustable dead-band gain and a supervisory controller inside dead-band area for the rudder system and a proportional controller to control the heading angle. The reason of using supervisory controller inside rudder controller?셲 dead-band block is to eliminate the steady-state error which occurs after applying dead-band block to the controller. This supervisory controller is an integral controller which specifically supervises the rudder?셲 behavior inside the dead-band area. In this study at the first stage we simulated our system in computer, and examined the proposed method?셲 feasibility. Next step was implementing the system on a real hydraulic steering model developed by us {{and at the end}} we finished the examination by implementing it on a real boat and doing test navigation.

5000|$|... 'Boat {{building}} uses many or {{the same}} tools that are common house tools such as hammers, cross cut saws, power drills, benches and vices. For building small boats under 5m some specialized tools are needed such as clamps (cramps) either G clamps or spring clamps. A minimum of 4 6inch(150mm) and 10 4inch(100mm) G clamps, plus 20 2 inch(50mm) steel spring clamps is need for ply on frame designs. More is better with clamps. Flat and round surform rasps are useful tools for shaping wood and ply. A drill set from 2-10mm, several speedbore drills for larger holes 12-25mm, (1/2inch-1 inch) rotary sanding backing pads {{and a range of}} replacement sanding pads from coarse (40grit) to fine (180grit), counter sinking drills for screws, a right angle set square, a set of manual screw drivers with blades to match screws being used are essential. A heavy craft knife, an 8m(25 ft) tape, flat and round files for metal and wood, a short(torpedo) level and a set of 3 chisels from 6 to 25mm are needed. Power tools make a job much easier and are relatively cheap. An 7 1/4inch (185mm) circular saw with a fine 40 tooth tungsten carbide blade, a jigsaw with a dust blower with a set of fine, medium and coarse tooth metal and wood blades is good for cutting plywood panels to shape, a rotary oscillating sander with medium and fine pads and a cordless drill for driving screws all save time and energy. A steam box is excellent for making planks easier to bend although hot wet rags are a messy, but easy substitute. A fine tooth hacksaw is not only essential for cutting metal such as trimming stainless steel bolts to the correct length but is handy for ultra-fine cuts in thin wood. A fine-tooth tenon saw is used to cut across the grain to produce a reasonably fine, accurate cut. Some boat builders have started using Japanese draw saws for fine cuts but while these are excellent they tend to be very expensive. A No 4 smoothing plane is essential but an electric plane is very useful (but extremely loud) for making <b>rudder</b> <b>blades</b> and centre boards. A much longer No. 7 plane is needed if the design calls for a wooden spars as used in many modern [...] "traditional" [...] yachts.|$|R

Meanwhile, Cheluskin, drifting in the pack ice off Cape Dezhnev, became the subject of a massive propaganda campaign and its rescue became a national emergency.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{widespread}} form of self-steering, the servo pendulum, {{was introduced}} {{to cope with the}} power required to operate a larger rudder and was a successor to the servo trim tab principle (introduced by Herbert [...] "Blondie" [...] Hasler). Common to all servo pendulum rudder(oar, blade) systems is the fact, that the speed of the boat through the water is used to amplify the small force coming from the wind vane {{in order to be able}} to turn the <b>rudder.</b> The servo <b>blade</b> can be turned in its vertical axis and is hung like a pendulum. When it is turned around its vertical axis, the water flow initiates a sideways force on the blade area, and the forceful swing movement to the side is used to act on a rudder (ship's rudder or auxiliary rudder being integrated in the system).A narrow upright board, the wind vane, is mounted on a nearly horizontal axis carrier that is itself rotated around its vertical axis so that with the boat traveling in the desired direction the vane is vertical and edge-on to the wind. The wind vane is balanced by a small weight below the pivot, but if the boat turns so that the board is no longer edge-on to the wind it will be blown over to one side as the extra surface area is revealed. This movement is transmitted by a series of linkages to a blade (or oar) in the water, so that the oar is turned around its vertical axis, when the wind vane rotates from its neutral position.As the blade described above turns, the pressure of water moving past it causes it to swing out sideways on the end of a pivoted rod. An immersed area of 0.1 m2 at 1 m lever length at a boat speed of 2.5 m/s (about 5 knots) and 5° angle of attack already generates a moment of 180 N⋅m, when the oar has a NACA0012 profile. The steering force of the servo oar is transmitted to the main rudder typically involving an arrangement of two lines and four or more rolls to guide the steering ropes to the helm or the steering wheel.|$|R
