50|$|In January 2017 An Post {{announced}} that a selection of the 100 objects would form the subjects for the 9th definitive postage stamp series for Ireland, to be issued {{over a period of}} five or six years from 2017. The first set of stamps featuring twelve of the objects were issued in January 2017, consisting of eight different SOAR (Stamps on a <b>Roll)</b> <b>stamps</b> with various values (€0.05 to €7.50), a range coil stamps, and a national (N) and an international (W) rate stamp booklet.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{variations}} of the 2nd Issue guns. Variants between serial numbers 12,000 through to about 20,000 involve {{the shape of the}} side plate ("straight" [...] or [...] "round"), the design of the trigger spring (flat spring, V spring or coil spring), and the number of patent dates on the cylinder (two or three). There was also a decrease {{in the size of the}} barrel <b>roll</b> <b>stamps</b> at around serial number 95,000. 2nd Issue marked [...] "2D QUAL'TY" [...] are also seen occasionally.|$|E
5000|$|The Border Patrol {{is a rare}} early variant on the Trooper frame, {{chambered}} in [...]38 Special only. Only about 500 were made, in 1952 only. They have [...] "BORDER PATROL" [...] <b>roll</b> <b>stamped</b> on a heavy barrel. These often {{sell for}} $4,000+ and are {{considered one of the}} Holy Grails for Colt double-action collectors.|$|R
25|$|In some instances, images or designs can be {{transferred}} to metal surfaces via mechanical process. One such process is <b>roll</b> <b>stamping</b> or roller-die engraving. In this process, a hardened image die is pressed against the destination surface using extreme pressure to impart the image. In the 1800s pistol cylinders were often decorated via this process to impart a continuous scene around its surface.|$|R
5000|$|In 1923, Stoeger, Inc. {{obtained}} the American trademark for the [...] "Luger" [...] {{name for the}} import of German-built parabellum pistols into the United States. The 1923 commercial models, in [...]30 Luger and 9mm, and with barrel lengths from 75 mm to 600 mm were the first pistols to bear the name [...] "Luger", <b>roll</b> <b>stamped</b> {{on the right side}} of the receiver. Stoeger has retained the rights to the [...] "Luger" [...] name. Over the past seven decades, Stoeger imported a number of different handguns under the [...] "Luger" [...] mark, including an Erma-built [...]380 version and an American-manufacture [...]22 which only remotely resembled the original design.|$|R

5000|$|The stamps {{removed from}} coil {{production}} in the late teens and early twenties were [...] "discarded as unfit," [...] {{according to a report}} from a director of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing [...] "on account of narrow margins, too close perforations and other reasons." [...] A notable example is a 1919 1¢ Washington stamp (Scott Catalogue #538). This, according to Max Johl, had [...] "received the regulation one way vertical coil perforation while forming part of the long <b>rolls</b> of <b>stamps</b> printed on the rotary press. The coil perforating machines…fitted for perforating <b>rolls</b> of <b>stamps</b> could not be used to perforate sheets, so these stamps had to be perforated the other way (horizontally) on the regulation eleven gauge flat plate perforating machines." [...] The rarest coil waste issue from the Washington-Franklin series is another 1¢ Washington stamp produced in 1921 (Scott #544). Other Washington-Franklin examples include Scott #539-541.|$|R
50|$|Material {{selection}} {{is one of}} the key considerations in producing fuel tanks. The three most common materials used in the manufacture of fuel tanks are aluminum, steel, and stainless steel. Regardless of the choice of material, the quality of the selection must be such as to allow that material to be malleable enough to be bent, <b>rolled</b> and <b>stamped</b> into formation.|$|R

50|$|While it was {{the growth}} of the iron {{foundries}} and tin plating that gave birth to japanning on metal, tin plated iron was not the only metal used. There are examples of brass, copper and bronze used as substrates. In France copper was the metal primarily used. Because it had to be hammered into shape rather than <b>rolled</b> and <b>stamped</b> the surface was uneven. This did not provide the best surface for japanning thus it has a greater tendency to flake off than the smoother English tinware. When the French made tinware it was often trimmed with bronze.|$|R

The {{foundation for the}} 178 by 206 foot building, of steel frame covered with corrugated iron, was made of sandstone from the Hebard Quarry. The mill's equipment included three sets of stamps and three sets of auxiliary crushing <b>rolls.</b> The <b>stamps</b> each had a capacity of 500 tons daily. Four houses and a large two story building were built near the mill. The two story structure was {{to be used as}} a school on the first floor and a meeting room on the second.

50|$|The GMT800 {{introduced}} a three section frame system, {{which could be}} mixed and matched depending on the wheelbase, GVWR, and body type fitted to the platform, rather than a single piece long frame. The front section was hydroformed. The middle and rear sections were <b>roll</b> formed or <b>stamped,</b> depending on application. This gives greater flexibility to the platform. A total of four front modules, seven midsections, and four rear sections were created to mix and match for nearly 40 different truck configurations.|$|R

5000|$|Henry Wehrhahn, {{employee}} of Nellie Bly’s Iron Clad Manufacturing Company of New York, received two patents in December 1905 {{that would lead}} to the modern 55-gallon steel barrel. Use of 200-litre drums became widespread in World War II, the first war in which trucks, cold <b>rolled</b> steel, <b>stamp</b> or pattern forging machinery and welding were widely available. They were first developed by the Axis powers (Germany and Italy), but were quickly adopted by Allies. [...] The drums helped win the Guadalcanal Campaign in the first U.S. offensive in the South Pacific Theater. The U.S. Navy could not maintain command of the sea long enough to offload aviation gasoline for aircraft ashore, so the drums were often transported to the island on fast ships, such as destroyers, and shoved over the sides (or, time permitting, lowered in cargo nets). Because gasoline's density is much less than that of water, the drums floated. Navy Seabees in small craft corralled the drums.|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: the {{thin-wall}} steel casts of the responsible purpose. The {{purpose of the}} work: the development of technical solutions and creating the technological casting process by the molten models with crystallization under the pressure on its base, ensuring the obtaining of the thin-wall casts with the preset construction strength. The tests of mechanical properties, the fatigue tests, hydrotests, thermographing and modeling have been performed. The increase of density of the cast metal and elimination of the cast defects have been established, the heat-power parameters of the processes for receiving the molten models, sheath forms and casts have been justified. The distribution of the steel temperature in the metal receiver, filling of thin walls resulting from the pressure and steel consumption rate at the mould inlet have been established. The technological processes of receiving the models to be molten, sheath forms and casts allowing to use the casts instead of the <b>roll</b> stock, <b>stamping</b> and welded joints have been developed.

The microstructure evolution is a critical factor for evaluating the severity of a fabrication process, especially the plastic deformation. This paper mainly attempts to understand the microstructural changes involved with the Chain-die forming process. Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) observation and Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) analysis were adopted to have a deep understanding on microstructure evolution. Microscopic results of the investigation show that there is almost no variation of grains, with respect to Kernel Average Misorientation (KAM) value and rotation of the grains, in the undeformed areas. Rotation of the grains is observed between inner edge and outer surface regions. The microscopic analysis also revealed that the KAM distribution shifts to higher values at the highly deformed region...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{summarizes}} {{our recent}} {{efforts to develop}} the manufacturing technologies of consolidated net-shape components by using new low-cost commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy powders made by the Armstrong process. Fabrication processes of net shape / near net shape components, such as uniaxial die-pressing, cold isostatic pressing (CIP), sintering, <b>roll</b> compaction and <b>stamping,</b> have been evaluated. The press-and-sinter processing of the powders were systematically investigated in terms of theoretical density and microstructure {{as a function of}} time, pressure, and temperature. Up to 96. 4 % theoretical density has been achieved with the press-and-sinter technology. Tensile properties of the consolidated samples exhibit good ductility as well as equivalent yield/ultimate tensile strengths to those of fully consolidate materials, even with the presence of a certain amount of porosity. A consolidation model is also under development to interpret the powder deformation during processing. Net shape components made of the Armstrong powder can successfully be fabricated with clearer surface details by using press-and-sinter processing...|$|R
