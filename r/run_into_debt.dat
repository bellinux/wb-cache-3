25|$|When, in 2000, the MBTA's budget became limited, {{the agency}} began to <b>run</b> <b>into</b> <b>debt</b> from {{scheduled}} projects and obligatory Big Dig remediation work, which have now given the MBTA the highest debt of any transit {{authority in the}} country. In an effort to compensate, rates underwent an appreciable hike on January 1, 2007. Increasingly, local advocacy groups are calling on the state to assume $2.9 billion of the authority's now approximate debt of $9 billion, the interest on which severely limits funds available for required projects.|$|E

60|$|This {{was very}} honest indeed, and I really believe he spoke as he intended, {{and that he}} was a man that was as well {{qualified}} to make me happy, as to his temper and behaviour, as any man ever was; but his having no estate, and being <b>run</b> <b>into</b> <b>debt</b> on this ridiculous account in the country, made all the prospect dismal and dreadful, and I knew not what to say, or what to think of myself.|$|E
6000|$|The {{state of}} {{prosperity}} to which Jack referred did not last. Their first [...] "claim," [...] though rich, was soon worked out, {{and they were}} obliged to seek another.

Nevertheless, they worked on in hope, but what was termed their [...] "luck" [...] became worse and worse every day, so that at last they were obliged to <b>run</b> <b>into</b> <b>debt.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Mali it was {{reported}} that many people <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> <b>debts</b> in order to join the Qnet network after they were made to believe that their life will change and they will become rich, but that never happened. That was because after making a purchase, the unlucky customer failed to get other people to join their network.|$|R
50|$|Mr. Protais Le Hivain, aka Macrocephalic. Le Hivain is {{a dubious}} lawyer. He is called Macrocephalic (i.e. long-shaped head) by the {{schoolmaster}} {{of the village}} of Glénac and plays a double game.

50|$|With {{the costs}} of a 28-day FM RSL just {{managing}} {{to stay within the}} four-figure mark, Fresh Air FM barely managed to break even, and often <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> <b>debt.</b> The situation came to a head in 2002, where debts reached a level that was unsustainable.

60|$|I {{have said}} that an English clerk made {{a part of that}} small {{establishment}} in the dingy banking-office in the Schrannen Platz, and I must say a word or two of Herbert Onslow. In his early career he had not been fortunate. His father, with means sufficiently moderate, and with a family more than sufficiently large, had sent him to a public school at which he had been very idle, and then to one of the universities, at which he had <b>run</b> <b>into</b> <b>debt,</b> and had therefore left without a degree. When this occurred, a family council of war had been held among the Onslows, and it was decided that Herbert should be sent off to the banking-house of Heines, at Munich, there being a cousinship between the families, and some existing connections of business.|$|E

A week ago they would have been of the first importance. Here we are {{face to face with the}} greatest catastrophe and the greatest opportunity in history.

Gurdjieff became acquainted with Gertrude Stein through Rope members, but she was never a follower.|$|R

60|$|A tradesman, therefore, {{especially}} at his beginning, {{ought to be}} very wary of taking too much credit; he had much better slip the occasion of buying {{now and then a}} bargain to his advantage, for that is usually the temptation, than buying a greater quantity of goods than he can pay for, <b>run</b> <b>into</b> <b>debt,</b> and be insulted, and at last ruined. Merchants, and wholesale dealers, to put off their goods, are very apt to prompt young shopkeepers and young tradesmen to buy great quantities of goods, and take large credit at first; but it is a snare that many a young beginner has fallen into, and been ruined in the very bud; for if the young beginner does not find a vent for the quantity, he is undone; for at the time of payment the merchant expects his money, whether the goods are sold or not; and if he cannot pay, he is gone at once.|$|E
60|$|Leonard {{received}} the letter at breakfast-time. He {{did not give}} it any special attention, as he had other letters at the same time, some of which were, if less pleasant, of more immediate importance. He had of late been bombarded with dunning letters from tradesmen; for during his University life, and ever since, he had <b>run</b> <b>into</b> <b>debt.</b> The moderate allowance his father made him he had treated as cash for incidental expenses, but everything else had been on credit. Indeed {{he was beginning to}} get seriously alarmed about the future, for his father, who had paid his debts once, {{and at a time when}} they were by comparison inconsiderable, had said that he would not under any circumstances pay others. He was not sorry, therefore, for an opportunity of getting away for a few hours from home; from himself--from anxieties, possibilities. The morning was a sweltering one, and he grumbled to himself as he set out on his journey through the woods.|$|E
60|$|But Amy {{soon came}} to a better {{understanding}} of him, for she presently learnt that he had a most scoundrel character; that there was nothing of weight in anything he said; but that he was, in short, a mere sharper, one that would stick at nothing to get money, and that there was no depending on anything he said; and that more especially about the lieutenant's commission, she understood that there was nothing at all in it, but they told her how he had often made use of that sham to borrow money, and move gentlemen to pity him and lend him money, in hopes to get him preferment; that he had reported that he had a wife and five children in England, who he maintained out of his pay, and by these shifts had <b>run</b> <b>into</b> <b>debt</b> in several places; and upon several complaints for such things, he had been threatened to be turned out of the gens d'armes; and that, in short, he was not to be believed in anything he said, or trusted on any account.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Carnivàle {{takes place in}} the mid-1930s during the worst of the Great Depression, a time of massive social and {{political}} upheaval. Unemployment rates were high, and European fascism was on the rise, in the years leading up to the Second World War. People in the Great Plains suffered from the effects of the Dust Bowl. Farmers often not only <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> <b>debt</b> and lost their properties but also risked their health; dust pneumonia was a common cause of death.|$|R

60|$|I {{was struck}} dumb at the sight, and knew neither {{what to say}} nor what to do; {{he did not know}} me, and that was all the present relief I had. I quitted my company, and retired as much as that dreadful place suffers anybody to retire, and I cried vehemently for a great while. 'Dreadful {{creature}} that I am,' said I, 'how may poor people have I made miserable? How many desperate wretches have I sent to the devil?' He had told me at Chester he was ruined by that match, and that his fortunes were made desperate on my account; for that thinking I had been a fortune, he was <b>run</b> <b>into</b> <b>debt</b> more than he was able to pay, and that he knew not what course to take; that he would go into the army and carry a musket, or buy a horse and take a tour, as he called it; and though I never told him that I was a fortune, and so did not actually deceive him myself, yet I did encourage the having it thought that I was so, and by that means I was the occasion originally of his mischief.|$|E
60|$|It added {{much to the}} {{hardship}} of the woman's case that public sympathy in distant parts of the country,--up in London, and in southern counties, and even among {{a portion of the}} gentry in Cumberland and Westmoreland,--did not go with her. She had married without due care. Some men said,--and many women repeated the story,--that she had known of the existence of the former wife, when she had married the Earl. She had <b>run</b> <b>into</b> <b>debt,</b> and then repudiated her debts. She was now residing in the house of a low radical tailor, who had assaulted the man she called her husband; and she was living under her maiden name. Tales were told of her which were utterly false,--as when it was said that she drank. Others were reported which had in them some grains of truth,--as that she was violent, stiff-necked, and vindictive. Had they said of her that it had become her one religion to assert her daughter's right,--per fas aut nefas,--to assert it by right or wrong; to do justice to her child let what injustice might be done to herself or others,--then the truth would have been spoken.|$|E
5000|$|In 1855 Le Gray {{opened a}} [...] "lavishly furnished" [...] studio.

Perhaps it was the old Adam left in Ernest a little; but though he could stand kindness from Dr. Greatrex or from Mr. Lancaster stoically enough, he couldn't watch the humble devotion of those two honest-hearted simple old servants without a mingled thrill of shame and tenderness. 'Mrs. Halliss,' he said, catching up the landlady's hard red hand gratefully in his own, 'you are too good and too kind, and too considerate for us altogether. I feel we have done nothing to deserve such great kindness from you.

60|$|At college Philip did fairly well, and, being a Caresfoot, did not <b>run</b> <b>into</b> <b>debt.</b> He was, as {{his great}} bodily {{strength}} gave promise of, a first-class athlete, {{and for two}} years stroked the Magdalen boat. Nor did he altogether neglect his books, but his reading was of a desultory and out-of-the-way order, and much directed towards the investigation of mystical subjects. Fairly well liked amongst the men with whom he mixed, he could hardly be called popular; his temperament was too uncertain for that. At times he was the gayest of the gay, {{and then when the}} fit took him he would be plunged into a state of gloomy depression that might last for days. His companions, to whom his mystical studies were a favourite jest, were wont to assert that on these occasions he was preparing for a visit from his familiar, but the joke was one that he never could be prevailed upon to appreciate. The fact of the matter was that these fits of gloom were constitutional with him, and very possibly had their origin in the state of his mother's mind before his birth, when her whole thoughts were coloured by her morbid and fanciful terror of her husband, and her frantic anxiety to conciliate him.|$|E
60|$|Nidderdale {{had been}} observing {{her while she}} {{had been talking to}} Miss Carbury. He had heard the rumour, and of course felt that it behoved him to be on his guard more {{specially}} than any one else. But he had not believed what he had heard. That men should be thoroughly immoral, that they should gamble, get drunk, <b>run</b> <b>into</b> <b>debt,</b> and make love to other men's wives, was to him a matter of everyday life. Nothing of that kind shocked him at all. But he was not as yet quite old enough to believe in swindling. It had been impossible to convince him that Miles Grendall had cheated at cards, and the idea that Mr Melmotte had forged was as improbable and shocking to him as that an officer should run away in battle. Common soldiers, he thought, might do that sort of thing. He had almost fallen in love with Marie when he saw her last, and was inclined to feel the more kindly to her now because of the hard things that were being said about her father. And yet he knew that he must be careful. If 'he came a cropper' in this matter, it would be such an awful cropper! 'How do you like the party?' he said to Marie.|$|E
