40|$|The BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) {{provides}} <b>Radio</b> <b>Navigation</b> <b>Service</b> System (RNSS) {{as well as}} Radio Determination Service System (RDSS). RDSS {{users can}} obtain positioning by responding the Master Control Center (MCC) inquiries to signal transmitted via GEO satellite transponder. The positioning result can be calculated with elevation constraint by MCC. The primary error sources affecting the RDSS positioning accuracy are the RDSS signal transceiver delay, atmospheric trans-mission delay and GEO satellite position error. During GEO orbit maneuver, poor orbit forecast accuracy significantly impacts RDSS services. A real-time 3 -D orbital correction method based on wide-area differential technique is raised to correct the orbital error. Results from the observation shows that the method can successfully improve positioning precision during orbital maneuver, independent from the RDSS reference station. This improvement can reach 50 % in maximum. Accurate calibration of the RDSS signal transceiver delay precision and digital elevation map may have {{a critical role in}} high precise RDSS positioning services...|$|E

Two U slots are designed on rectangular patch and fed through microstrip line, using FSS with modified Jerusalem cross elements proposes a new antenna in multi band operation within 1 GHz to 10 GHz and improve the antenna gain and return loss characteristic. It is demonstrated through simulation that the return loss value occurred at 2 GHz, 2. 27 GHz, 2. 54 GHz, 3. 27 GHz, 4. 45 GHz, 5. 45 GHz, 6. 27 GHz, 6. 9 GHz, 8. 72 GHz, and 9. 54 GHz respectively for mobile satellite(earth to space communication), earth exploration satellite (space to earth) (space to space), fixed satellite(space to earth communication), radio location(radio navigation service), fixed mobile(aeronautical mobile telemetry for flight testing by aircraft stations), Earth exploration-satellite service, aeronautical <b>Radio</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>service</b> to airborne radars, fixed satellite service (Earth-to-space communication) (space-to-Earth communication), radio location and space research applications. The proposed antenna is analysed using Ansoft HFSS 13 and simulated results are presented in terms of return loss, VSWR, percentage bandwidth and radiation pattern. The performance of the antenna has been analysed by using FSS consisting of Jerusalem cross element {{which is used to}} improve antenna performance with sufficient bandwidth and comparatively high return loss than dual U slot without FSS and is capable of multi band operation.

40|$|Landing aircrafts under low {{visibility}} conditions {{has always been}} a challenge even with conventional navigation systems like ILS (Instrument Landing System). CAT III, with GBAS (Ground Based Augmentation Systems) and GPS only can't be reached without relaxing the alarm limits and continuity requirements of air navigation. The objective of this work is to analyze the impact of Galileo in the performances of GBAS and to compare the integrity levels obtained with the requirements of CAT III under severe ionospheric gradients. Galileo is providing some promising features like the possibility offered to the aviation community to acquire 3 frequencies: L 1, E 5 a and E 5 b in the ARNS band (Aeronautical <b>Radio</b> <b>Navigation</b> <b>Service).</b> This will augment the robustness of the complete system and will provide efficient smoothing techniques when considering also the phase observations. Another feature concerns the possibility to have a different constellation with another geometry characteristic; this would improve the Geometry Dilution Of Precision (low GDOP) and the number of visible satellite at any epoch can reach 15 or 16 when coupled with GPS. The BOC (Binary Offset Carrier) signal structure in L 1 provides a high multipath rejection capacity that provides promising results at both GBAS ground subsystem and airborne receiver level. The probability of satellite outages coupled with the number of available satellites (27 + 3 spares) will dramatically improve the availability of the combined GPS and Galileo system. Different smoothing algorithms developed at Stanford University (GPS Lab) are applied: The ionosphere free and the divergence free smoothing to mitigate or even to cancel the ionosphere gradient. The availability of the vertical protection level with respect to CAT III vertical alarm limit is analysed. As a major result, the ionosphere free combination for a dual constellation dual frequency using an all in view satellites can fulfil CAT III with respect to the protection levels and it provides a robust solution with a very low risk of misleading information...|$|E

40|$|International audienceA novel {{reconfigurable}} and {{circularly polarized}} antenna topology for satellite application services, {{based on a}} pyramidal geometry, is proposed. Frequency agility is simply obtained by loading the radiating elements by Radio-Frequency switches. The ground plane of the antenna is perforated and loaded by a cut-off and open-ended waveguide. The length of this waveguide is adjusted to achieve a good trade-off between rear radiation and impedance matching. A specific application of this original topology is described in this paper. It consists {{in the design of}} a reconfigurable dual-band antenna for Aeronautical <b>Radio</b> <b>Navigation</b> <b>Services</b> (ARNS) and <b>Radio</b> <b>Navigation</b> Satellite <b>Services</b> (RNSS). The computed input return loss is lower than - 10 dB in all the considered frequency bands and quasi-hemispheric radiation patterns are obtained.

40|$|The {{landing of}} {{aircraft}} under low visibility conditions {{has always been}} a challenge even with conventional navigation systems like ILS (Instrument Landing System). The requirements for CAT III can not be reached with Ground Based Augmentation Systems (GBAS) for single frequency GPS only without relaxing the alarm limits and continuity requirements of air navigation. Large delay gradients between the GBAS ground station and the user caused by ionospheric anomalies, remain the main threat for GBAS. Using GBAS with both GPS and Galileo in a combined constellation will increase the robustness of the complete system. Galileo is providing promising features like the possibility offered to the aviation community to acquire 3 frequencies: L 1, E 5 a and E 5 b in the Aeronautical <b>Radio</b> <b>Navigation</b> <b>Service</b> (ARNS) band. The consideration of phase observations allows the use of efficient smoothing techniques: the ionosphere free and the divergence free dual frequency smoothing algorithms which have been defined in [1], allow to mitigate or even to cancel the ionosphere gradient. Due to the different geometry characteristic of the extended constellation the Geometry Dilution of Precision (GDOP) is reduced. The low probability of satellite outages combined with the number of additionally available satellites will dramatically improve the availability of the combined GPS and Galileo system. The objective of this work is to analyze the impact of Galileo {{through the use of a}} combined constellation on the performance of GBAS under severe ionospheric gradients. The errors experienced by a user with a spatial separation of 5 km and 20 NM respectively to the GBAS ground station are evaluated. The simulation scenario considers an ionosphere anomaly with a gradient of 420 mm per km between the ground station and the user – a value which has turned out to be a worst-case assumption as explained before in several publications [2]. The dual frequency smoothing techniques mentioned above are applied. The simulation is performed over a period of several days to account for the effects of the changing satellite geometry. The models of the GBAS residual errors used in the preceding work [3] were considered to be Gaussian distributed individual errors. To give a more realistic representation of the individual errors used in the simulation, we use distributions of errors which are, in general not Gaussian. The distributions are derived from measurements or theoretical considerations pertaining to the origin of the error. Here, we consider the four major individual sources of pseudorange error in GBAS systems: receiver noise, ionosphere and troposphere, multipath. For this work, the impact of applying smoothing filter, averaging and position calculation are taken into account...|$|E
50|$|Very low {{frequency}} or VLF is the ITU designation for radio frequencies (RF) {{in the range}} of 3 to 30 kilohertz (kHz), corresponding to wavelengths from 100 to 10 kilometres, respectively. The band is also known as the myriametre band or myriametre wave as the wavelengths range from one to ten myriametres (an obsolete metric unit equal to 10 kilometres). Due to its limited bandwidth, audio (voice) transmission is highly impractical in this band, and therefore only low data rate coded signals are used. The VLF band is used for a few <b>radio</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>services,</b> government time <b>radio</b> stations (broadcasting time signals to set radio clocks) and for secure military communication. Since VLF waves can penetrate at least 40 meters (120 ft) into saltwater, they are used for military communication with submarines.|$|R

As a consequence, even under conservative assumptions, the ranging sources will more than triple. In addition, the ionospheric delay will be estimated and removed by receivers using dual frequency.

40|$|GNSS, or more {{precisely}} GNSS- 2, is an abbreviation for Glob al Navigation Satellite Systems – Second generation, {{and serves as a}} generic name for the class of modern global sa tellite based <b>radio</b> <b>navigation</b> systems. GNSS- 2 consists mainly of the four major Global Navigation Satellite Systems known as: GPS (U. S.), GLONASS (Russia), Galileo (EU) and Bei-Dou- 2 (China). All these global <b>radio</b> <b>navigation</b> systems are based on the same navigation principle, i. e. utilizing ultra- stable clocks in satellites to determine the user position by independent measurements of the transit time of electromagnetic signals transmitted from satellites in orbit, so-called <b>Radio</b> <b>Navigation</b> Satellite <b>Services</b> (RNSS). The typical performance of these global <b>radio</b> <b>navigation</b> systems is to provide absolute positioning to an observer {{on the surface of the}} Earth within the precision of 5 - 10 meter. However, this precision can be improved utilizing state of the art processing techniques such as Precise Point Positioning (PPP), currently demonstrating absolute positioning of 5 - 10 centimeters utilizing only one receiver. To achieve this astonishing precision in terms of absolute position, the rate of time as measured on the clock in the satellite must be known to better than a few nanoseconds. Since the satellites are constantly moving with respect to the observer and are also located at highly different gravitational potentials, effects predicted by both the Special- and General theories of Relativity must be considered in order to achieve the desired accuracy in the observed transit times. These systems are in fact one of the very few man made systems, outside of particle accelerators, that experience significant relativistic effects...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Galileo E 5 {{signal is}} of {{particular}} interest to the civil aviation community. Indeed, it will be broadcast in an Aeronautical <b>Radio</b> <b>Navigation</b> <b>Services</b> (ARNS). Moreover, combined with the Galileo E 1 signal, Galileo E 5 will allow dual-frequency ionosheric-free pseudoranges combinations supporting a dramatic increase of accuracy. In addition, one of its components, E 5 b, will carry the Galileo integrity message needed by the user to benefit from the Safety-of-Life service (SoL). Civil aviation users have specific requirements in terms of performance of future Galileo receivers. Those requirements are provided by EUROCAE in the interim Minimum Operational Performance Specification (MOPS) document as developed by the Working Group 62. One important minimum requirement is for the receiver to process independently Galileo E 5 a and E 5 b signals mainly in order to reduce interference impact and to benefit from the Safety-of-Life (SoL) service. There are different possible signal processing techniques to build a civil aviation receiver achieving the performance requirements which are stated in terms of accuracy and robustness to interference, for instance. This paper presents an overview of the different signal processing techniques expected to be implemented in future Galileo E 5 receivers to meet civil aviation requirements. Most of the presented techniques were considered by EUROCAE WG 62 to derive requirements. Some new techniques which could provide increased performance, at the cost of an increased complexity in general, are presented as well. The levels of performance achieved by all those techniques are indicated. In the first section of this paper, the Galileo E 5 signal, as described in the Galileo SIS ICD, is shortly presented. Then, the architecture of the receiver is described along with the main functions involved and their respective performance for Galileo E 5 signal. These functions are: RF/IF filtering, the blanker system (temporal and frequency-based: FDAF), the acquisition process (temporal and frequency-based), tracking process and interference detection techniques...|$|R
