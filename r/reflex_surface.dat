40|$|Seven {{patients}} with cortical action myoclonus were studied. Six of these also had cortical <b>reflex</b> myoclonus. <b>Surface</b> and needle recordings {{were made from}} intrinsic hand muscles. Reflex and action jerks often consisted {{of a series of}} EMG bursts, some of which were polyphasic. The interval between repetitive EMG bursts was most commonly approximately 20 ms. The first EMG burst following median nerve stimulation varied in latency by a few milliseconds. Needle recordings of this reflex response showed more than one peak in half of the post-stimulus time histograms (PSTH) collected. Multiple peaks were narrow and separated by as little as 4 ms. Single trials of the EEG activity over the sensorimotor cortex were recorded during stimulation or voluntary movement of the contralateral limb in five patients. Activity typically consisted of a rhythmic series of giant positive spike-slow negative wave complexes. Intervals between spikes tended to cluster at approximately 20 ms. Frequency histograms of spike to EMG burst intervals confirmed that spikes preceded muscle discharges but they showed more than one peak. These peaks were narrow and separated by as little as 3 ms. Thus, in {{patients with}} cortical myoclonus rhythmic muscle responses are driven by the sensorimotor cortex, which has a tendency to oscillatory activity. Two types of cortical rhythmicity are present. The first determines the frequency of repetitive EEG spikes and EMG bursts. The second is of higher frequency and underlies the multiple peaks separated by short intervals in PSTHs and histograms of spike to EMG burst intervals.

After head-down tilt, isometric strength and isokinetic strength of the plantar flexors were unchanged, while the triceps surae reflex time associated with plantar flexion movement slowed slightly.

For example, instead of cre-ating separate grammar symbols to mark the definiteness of an NP, our parser might instead capture the same information from the first word of the NP. Moving context out of the grammar and onto surface fea-tures can greatly simplify the structural component of the parser: because so many deep syntactic cues have <b>surface</b> <b>reflexes,</b> our system can still parse accurately with context-free backbones as minimal as X-bar grammars.

40|$|Stroke causes paresis in leg muscles, such as {{the knee}} extensors, that {{significantly}} impairs motor control and function during tasks such as walking. Reduced endurance and increased kinematic asymmetries during walking over time indicate paretic musculature may fatigue more quickly than non-paretic musculature. The primary {{purpose of this study}} was to identify abnormalities in neuromuscular fatigue (reduction in force over time) of the paretic knee extensors and associate them with motor performance. We investigated the effects of repeated six second isometric submaximal (30 % of maximum voluntary contraction) knee extensor fatiguing contractions on task failure and motor performance in ten chronic stroke subjects and compared them to ten, healthy controls. A systematic criterion determined task failure. We recorded knee extensor torque, stretch <b>reflex</b> responses, <b>surface</b> electromyography (EMG) of agonist (rectus femoris and vastus medialis) and antagonist (medial hamstring) knee extensor muscles, and muscle fiber conduction velocity (CV) of the vastus lateralis muscle as interpretive measures of neuromuscular fatigue. A power spectral density analysis of the intermittent target torque estimated the effect of fatigue on force fluctuations. Two isometric submaximal torque tracking tasks performed before and after fatigue provided direct measures of fatigue on force variability and error. Stroke subjects failed the fatiguing task significantly sooner than control subjects. In controls, averaged rectified EMG amplitude significantly increased and CV significantly reduced with fatigue, while no changes occurred in stroke. Fatigue caused a spectral shift toward higher force fluctuation frequencies in control but not stroke subjects. Time to task failure in stroke subjects negatively correlated with their walking speed. Additionally, pre-fatigue torque variability and error was greater in stroke than control subjects, and increased significantly with fatigue. In summary, paretic knee extensors have increased neuromuscular fatigability of the paretic knee extensors which relates to walking speed. The interpretative measures suggest that central factors may contribute more to time-to-task failure as compared to peripheral (muscular factors) in stroke survivors. Performance data demonstrate pre and post-fatigue impairments in sub-maximal force regulation. Taken together, these data demonstrate previously un-described impairments in paretic knee extensor force generation and regulation that could contribute to motor dysfunction post stroke...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} view of clause structure which essentially amounts to denying its existence. Phenomena like adverb placement, short verb movement and verb second, which form core cases in support of contemporary notions of CP-fields and IP-fields in the clause, are better handled in other ways which do not resort {{to the notion of}} arbitrary selectional sequences of (functional) syntactic heads. Constraints on the relative ordering with which sentential adverbs can co-occur are treated as a polarity phenomenon. Speaker-oriented adverbs are excluded from monotone decreasing environments, and hence, cannot be outscoped by adverbs like never. Apart from such requirements, adverb placement is argued to be free. The standard analysis of verb-second in terms of the selectional sequence C,I,V and headmovement of the finite verb to C with subsequent topicalization is shown to run into a series of problems which are taken to show that verb-second does not involve head movement, and that it should not be characterized in terms of a selectional sequence of heads. The proposed accound treats topicalization, verb movement and argument shift as <b>surface</b> <b>reflexes</b> of one movement operation to the first position. This is argued to explain a number of puzzling phenomena, including Holmberg s Generalization concerning the constraints on Object Shift in Scandinavian. Finally, (short) verb movement phenomena, as witnessed in italian, are analuzed as a scrambling phenomenon, driven by stress/focus and scope considerations. This explains the optionality of such verb movements and resolves a some paradoxical properties of the standard treatment by removing the need to postulate specific functional heads to attract the verbs...|$|R
40|$|When a voluntarily {{contracting}} human {{muscle is}} stretched its <b>surface</b> <b>reflex</b> electromyographic response has both short-latency (M 1) and long-latency (M 2) components. The M 1 component occurs at a latency compatible with monosynaptic reflex activation. The long-latency component results from stimulation {{of skin and}} other subcutaneous receptors. In the initial experiment, using the first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI) of the hand, the reflex sensitivity in normal human subjects was studied by comparing the various components of the electromyographic response generated by briefly stretching the voluntarily contracting muscle in subjects of various ages. It was found that age-related changes occur in the reflex response of human subjects. Although it is already known that the reflex response in human muscle slows with age, {{the result of the}} experiment showed that the size of that reflex response becomes smaller. The evidence suggests an impaired reflex sensitivity in older people which could be reflected in other motor control systems within the body. A detailed investigation was then undertaken to discover the causes of this change. Although the reflex response (M 1) was found to alter with age the M 2 component did not. This would seem to rule out neuromuscular block (NMB). NMB as a cause of the change was investigated and was found not to occur in the paradigm employed in this investigation. Possible changes in the mechanical properties of muscles and joints were looked for in a series of experiments using an accelerometer. No changes large enough to account for the reflex impairment could be found.

Tonic experimental masseter pain {{has recently been}} shown to reduce the inhibitory <b>reflex</b> response in <b>surface</b> EMG recordings but the effect on SMU activity has not been described. In this study, motor-unit action potentials were recorded with wire electrodes inserted into the left masseter in eleven subjects. The subjects kept the SMU firing rate around 10 Hz by feedback. Ninety-nine electrical stimuli were applied sequentially to the left mental nerve with increasing stimulus delays in steps of 1 ms after the preceding motor unit action potential. The inhibitory reflex in SMU was recorded before, during and after infusion of hypertonic saline (5 %) into the ipsilateral masseter muscle. Spike train data were used to calculate (1) the mean pre- and post-stimulus inter-spike-intervals (ISI) {{in all of the}} 99 trials, (2) cumulative changes in firing probability, and (3) estimation of the compound inhibitory post- synaptic potential (IPSP) in the masseter motoneuron. Tonic masseter pain did not change pre-stimulus SMU firing characteristics but the mean ISI for the first post-stimulus discharge (158. 2 ± 9. 2 ms) was significantly decreased compared to the pre-pain (175. 8 ± 11. 3 ms, P ≤ 0. 05) and post-pain conditions (172. 6 ± 11. 6 ms, P ≤ 0. 05). The post-stimulus firing probability was significantly increased and the relative amplitude of the estimated IPSP significantly decreased during tonic masseter pain compared to pre-pain and post-pain conditions. In conclusion, this study indicates that tonic masseter pain has a net excitatory effect on the inhibitory jaw- reflexes, which could be mediated by presynaptic mechanisms on the involved motoneurons. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Rhythmic arm cycling suppresses soleus H-reflex amplitude by increasing segmental Ia PSI. There is a reciprocal organization in the human nervous system such that arm cycling modulates H-reflexes in leg muscles and leg cycling modulates H-reflexes in forearm muscles. However, comparatively {{little is known about}} mechanisms subserving the effects from leg to arm. Using a conditioning-test (C-T) stimulation paradigm, {{the purpose of this study}} was to test the hypothesis that changes in Ia PSI underlie the modulation of H-reflexes in forearm flexor muscles during leg cycling. Subjects performed leg cycling and static activation while H-reflexes were evoked in forearm flexor muscles. H-reflexes were conditioned with either electrical stimuli to the radial nerve (to increase Ia PSI; C-T interval  =  20 ms) or to the superficial radial (SR) nerve (to reduce Ia PSI; C-T interval  =  37 - 47 ms). While stationary, H-reflex amplitudes were significantly suppressed by radial nerve conditioning and facilitated by SR nerve conditioning. Leg cycling suppressed H-reflex amplitudes and the amount of this suppression was increased with radial nerve conditioning. SR conditioning stimulation removed the suppression of H-reflex amplitude resulting from leg cycling. Interestingly, these effects and interactions on H-reflex amplitudes were observed with subthreshold conditioning stimulus intensities (radial n., ∼ 0. 6 ×MT; SR n., ∼ perceptual threshold) that did not have clear post synaptic effects. That is, did not evoke <b>reflexes</b> in the <b>surface</b> EMG of forearm flexor muscles.

In a physical contact sport like soccer, direction-specific muscle reflex responses are crucial in maintaining core stability. Delayed core muscle response times repeatedly have been reported in patients with low back pain, but no study has compared core muscle reflex latencies and postural control between soccer players and less active nonplayers. Purpose: The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate whether soccer players will exhibit shorter average core muscle reflex latencies along with less postural sway in response to a sudden trunk perturbation compared with nonplayers. A second goal was to see whether postural control measures are a valid, more practical alternative for the use of surface EMG in measuring reflexive core neuromuscular control. Methods: Sudden trunk loading in the frontal and sagittal plane was used in 10 high-level amateur soccer players and 11 less active nonplayers to study core muscle <b>reflex</b> latencies, using <b>surface</b> EMG of six major trunk muscles. Simultaneously, kinematic response data of a balance seat were obtained using gyroscopes measuring seat angular velocity. Results: Soccer players demonstrated shorter reflex latencies compared with nonplayers for the rectus abdominis, erector spinae, and externus obliquus muscles in response to sagittal plane perturbations. These shorter reflex latencies went along with greater seat movement in response to sudden trunk loading, with moderate correlations between the two measures. Conclusions: The results showing shorter reflex latencies and greater balancing movements for soccer players add to the debate whether more postural sway is an appropriate indicator of having less neuromuscular control...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{comments are}} given on the guidelines suggested by Türker (1988) {{for studies on}} oral <b>reflexes</b> using the <b>surface</b> EMG of the masseter muscles in man, including the silent period. (i) Attention should not be confined to electrical stimulation since mechanoreceptors in the periodontium, especially in the periodontal ligament, can only be activated by mechanical stimulation of a tooth. Furthermore, different modes of stimulation and stimulation sites do not yield equivalent reflex complexes. Weak and transient mechanical stimulation of a tooth while clenching at {{a low level of}} 5 or 10 % MVC is a selective model (89 %) to study the influence of periodontal receptors. (ii) Statistical criteria should be applied on rectified and averaged EMG records to prevent any subjective bias in the measurements of reflex variables. Whether a period of increased EMG activity is due to clustering of action potentials of motor units firing of which was delayed by a preceding inhibition, or to a real excitatory influence, can be assessed by applying statistical criteria on averaged and subsequently rectified records. (iii) The clenching level should be less than 25 % of MVC to avoid muscle fatigue, and to elicit pronounced reflexes with a weak and therefore more selective stimulus. (iv) The stimulus intensity should be much less than six times the threshold if selectivity for mechanoreceptors is desired. Furthermore, periods of increased activity in surface EMG resulting from a weak stimulus are probably due to real excitatory influences and not to clustering of motor unit action potentials after an inhibition. (v) Jaw separation and the use of a force transducer are not always advantageous. If mechanical stimulation is applied to a tooth, clenching in full habitual occlusion causes a complete suppression of the influence of muscle spindles. A shift in activity between the various elevator muscles, and hence a change in activity of the muscle studied, may occur during an experimental session if biting force is used as a feedback. Such a shift is not relevant if feedback is carried out on rectified and low-pass filtered (1. 6 Hz) EMG of the muscle studied. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Spasticity is a {{neurological}} symptom {{that can occur}} after stroke and traumatic brain injury due to a lesion of the motor pathways descending from the brain to the brainstem and spinal cord. Spasticity is characterised by a velocity-dependent increase in resistance when muscles are passively stretched. There {{is a lack of}} valid measures of spasticity, which creates difficulties both in following the development of symptoms and in evaluation of potential treatment interventions. The overall aim of this thesis was to develop and evaluate a new objective measure able to separately quantify spasticity and other components of passive muscle resistance in the wrist and finger flexor muscles. A biomechanical model was developed and adopted into a measurement instrument that performs passive isokinetic movements extending the wrist and finger flexor muscles. The model estimates three different components of the measured resistance to passive movement: neural (spasticity, NC) and non-neural (elastic, EC and viscous, VC) components. The aim of Study I was to evaluate the new measurement model and to examine its validity. The model was adopted into a measurement instrument, the NeuroFlexor. The aim of Study II was to investigate the reliability and measurement error of the method. The aim of Study III was to investigate the method’s sensitivity to change, which was examined in the context of treatment with botulinum toxin type A. In Study IV, the NeuroFlexor was used to explore the relationship between spasticity and other measures of upper limb body functions and activity. In all four studies, the participants were all adults in the chronic stage after stroke or traumatic brain injury. The results from Study I showed that there was a strong association between the NC (spasticity) and the stretch <b>reflex</b> measured with <b>surface</b> electromyography (EMG). This was clearly shown in a nerve block test. The results also showed that the NC but not the EC and VC increased with increasing velocity of the muscle stretch. These results are in accordance with the definition of spasticity, and therefore constitute evidence of the method’s validity. The results from Study II showed a high reliability of the NeuroFlexor method both within and between raters. In Study III sensitivity to change was demonstrated. The results from this study showed that the method is sensitive enough to detect change on a group level; however, its sensitivity to change on the individual level needs to be explored further. In Study IV, the results showed that spasticity had only weak to moderate assocations with other measures of function and activity. The overall clinical implications and conclusions from this thesis are that this new method to measure spasticity is valid and is able to distinguish between spasticity and other components of passive muscle resistance in the wrist and finger muscles. The new method shows good psychometric properties making it a suitable alternative for more accurate clinical measurement of spacticity...|$|R
