They investigate and their ship breaks down on the surface. He did not yet, however, have a clear idea as to what the alien antagonist of the story would be.|$|E

Dr. Vahlen then requests that XCOM capture an Outsider for study. Upon capturing {{one of the}}se, the examination reveals that the Outsiders' exotic crystalline structures behave {{in a manner similar}} to antennas, <b>receiving</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> broadcast from a location buried underground on Earth. XCOM dispatches a team to investigate the signal; it is found to be coming from a base that the aliens have secretly established on Earth, where experiments are performed on abducted humans.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the major}} {{benefits}} provided by COFDM is in rendering radio broadcasts relatively immune to multipath distortion and signal fading due to atmospheric conditions or passing aircraft. Proponents of COFDM argue it resists multipath far better than 8VSB. Early 8VSB DTV (digital television) receivers often had difficulty <b>receiving</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal.</b> Also, COFDM allows single-frequency networks, which is not possible with 8VSB.|$|E
5000|$|Cells of an {{equivalence}} {{group that}} do not <b>receive</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> adopt <b>a</b> default fate. Alternatively, cells that <b>receive</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> take on different fates. [...] At a certain point, the fates of cells within an equivalence group become irreversibly determined, thus they lose their multipotent potential. The following provides examples of equivalence groups studied in nematodes and ascidians.|$|R
50|$|This is {{when the}} cell <b>receives</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> from the extra-cellular space, such as a {{neurotransmitter}} or hormone, that regulates the fusing of the vesicle to the plasma membrane {{and the release of}} its contents. The vesicle is transported to the plasma membrane. There it sits until it <b>receives</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> to fuse with the membrane and release its contents into the extra-cellular space.|$|R
50|$|One {{potential}} problem: {{determining who}} cannot <b>receive</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> is still based on analog rather than digital TV.|$|R
500|$|Early on 12 August, Trieste sailed from Genoa for Naples {{with the}} Soldati-class {{destroyer}} Fuciliere and a torpedo-boat, Ardito {{to join the}} 3rd Cruiser Division, which had left Messina early with the cruisers Gorizia, Bolzano and six destroyers after <b>receiving</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> from U-83 (Kapitänleutnant Hans Werner Kraus) that four cruisers and ten destroyers (MG 3) were close to Crete. The Italian cruisers and destroyers rendezvoused [...] north of Ustica off Palermo at {{the west end of}} Sicily, some of the ships being short of fuel and then moved south in two squadrons, preceded by the torpedo-boats Climene and Centauro. British reconnaissance aircraft from Malta had flown over Italian ports, a Spitfire pilot saw that the 3rd Cruiser Division had left port and at 18:54 a Baltimore crew saw the Italian ships rendezvous. On Malta, Park was not disturbed until the convoy and escort losses of the day, which depleted Force X; five Wellington bombers were sent to find the Italian cruisers and 15 Beaufort torpedo-bombers and 15 Beaufighters stood by.|$|E
500|$|According to Bowen, she was [...] "not a wolf person" [...] before penning Wolf: The Journey Home. [...] A {{language}} arts teacher at Flathead High School in northwest Montana {{and a former}} op-ed columnist for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, she stated that she read news reports about the Pleasant Valley wolf pack in the Daily Inter Lake, {{but it was the}} death of one of the Ninemile pups that spurred her to write the novel. In her words, it was [...] "one death too many" [...] from the many non-accidental deaths of the wolves, and she felt the [...] "story needed to be told". She spent four years studying wolves in preparation for writing the novel, particularly the lives of a pack of wolves that were part of the federal wolf relocation program and who were documented in records kept by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The pack formed in the spring of 1989 in Pleasant Valley, Montana. As in the novel, the alpha male was killed, mistaken for a dog by a rancher, {{and the rest of the}} pack was trapped, except the one pup that escaped. They were held in Kalispell until they could be transferred to Glacier Park. Using radio collars, biologists were able to track the pack members from their release to their eventual fates, as depicted in the novel. The pups born to Marta and Greatfoot were born in Spring 1990 in Ninemile Valley, an area near Missoula. When they stopped <b>receiving</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> for Marta, authorities searched for her body for weeks until her broken radio collar was found in a creek. Mike Jimenez, then a wildlife biologist and the Wyoming Wolf Recovery Project Leader, was the man in the blue truck who tracked and monitored the pack in the novel and fed the pups after the death of Greatfoot.|$|E
2500|$|Somewhat {{related with}} the concept of checked {{exceptions}} is exception synchronicity. Synchronous exceptions happen at a specific program statement whereas asynchronous exceptions can raise practically anywhere. It follows that asynchronous exception handling can't be required by the compiler. They are also difficult to program with. Examples of naturally asynchronous events include pressing Ctrl-C to interrupt a program, and <b>receiving</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> such as [...] "stop" [...] or [...] "suspend" [...] from another thread of execution.|$|E
50|$|The handler is a {{function}} that is performed on-demand when the application <b>receives</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal.</b> This is called exception handling.|$|R
50|$|A modem {{is similar}} to a transceiver, in that it sends and <b>receives</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal,</b> but <b>a</b> modem uses {{modulation}} and demodulation. It modulates <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> being transmitted and demodulates <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> being <b>received.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Alvarez was not {{convinced}} of {{one part of}} the argument – the need for the system to be accurate in elevation. He considered it to be an advantage if the system scanned a wide angle vertically, <b>receiving</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> from a long [...] "strip" [...] of the ground all at once. Since the radar returns from ground closer to the aircraft would be received first, a display being drawn outward from the center, the classic Plan Position Indicator, would naturally decode the signal back into a 2D display.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 June 1894, at {{a meeting}} of the British Association for the Advancement of Science at Oxford University, Lodge gave a {{memorial}} lecture on the work of Hertz (recently deceased) and the German physicist's proof of the existence of electromagnetic waves 6 years earlier. Lodge set up a demonstration on the quasi optical nature of [...] "Hertzian waves" [...] (radio waves) and demonstrated their similarity to light and vision including reflection and transmission. Later in June and on 14 August 1894 he did similar experiments, increasing the distance of transmission up to 55 meters. Lodge used a detector called a coherer (invented by Edouard Branly), a glass tube containing metal filings between two electrodes. When the small electrical charge from waves from an antenna were applied to the electrodes, the metal particles would cling together or [...] "" [...] causing the device to become conductive allowing the current from a battery to pass through it. In Lodge's setup the slight impulses from the coherer were picked up by a mirror galvanometer which would deflect a beam of light being projected on it, giving a visual signal that the impulse was received. After <b>receiving</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> the metal filings in the coherer were broken apart or [...] "decohered" [...] by a manually operated vibrator or by the vibrations of a bell placed on the table near by that rang every time a transmission was received. Since this was one year before Marconi's 1895 demonstration of a system for radio wireless telegraphy and contained many of the basic elements that would be used in Marconi's later wireless systems, Lodge's lecture became the focus of priority disputes with the Marconi Company a little over a decade later over invention of wireless telegraphy (radio). At the time of the dispute some, including the physicist John Ambrose Fleming, pointed out that Lodge's lecture was a physics experiment, not a demonstration of telegraphic signaling. Lodge would later work with Alexander Muirhead on the development of devices specifically for wireless telegraphy.|$|E
