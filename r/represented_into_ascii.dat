50|$|The Harvard-Kyoto Convention is {{a system}} for transliterating Sanskrit and other {{languages}} that use the Devanāgarī script <b>into</b> <b>ASCII.</b> It is predominantly used informally in e-mail, and for electronic texts.|$|R
50|$|JavE (Java ASCII Versatile Editor) is a {{computer}} program that allows the user to create ASCII art. In the workspace, users can draw with their mouse {{and it will be}} converted <b>into</b> <b>ASCII.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another {{choice would}} be to replace each letter with its binary representation, {{transpose}} that, and then convert the new binary string <b>into</b> the corresponding <b>ASCII</b> characters. Looping the scrambling process on the binary string multiple times before changing it <b>into</b> <b>ASCII</b> characters would likely {{make it harder to}} break. Many modern block ciphers use more complex forms of transposition related to this simple idea.|$|R
50|$|The BIOS in many {{personal}} computers stores {{the date and}} time in BCD because the MC6818 real-time clock chip used in the original IBM PC AT motherboard provided the time encoded in BCD. This form is easily converted <b>into</b> <b>ASCII</b> for display.|$|R
50|$|Printed output on a Teletype Model 33 ASR was {{controlled}} by a single pole relay. A subroutine would convert the LINC character codes <b>into</b> <b>ASCII</b> and use timing loops to toggle the relay on and off, generating the correct 8-bit output to control the Teletype printer.|$|R

50|$|Description: prints {{an array}} of {{characters}} or string onto the console window. The address of the first character is stored in R0 of the GPRs; each register holds two characters and the data is converted <b>into</b> <b>ASCII</b> before printing to the screen. Printing continues following {{the path of the}} string until the program finds consecutive data reading 0x0000.|$|R
50|$|ASCII art may {{be created}} from an {{existing}} digital image using an ASCII art converter, an online tool or a software application that automatically converts an image <b>into</b> <b>ASCII</b> art, using vector quantization. Typically, {{this is done}} by sampling the image down to grayscale with less than 8-bit precision, so that each value corresponds to different ASCII character.|$|R
25|$|Usenet was {{originally}} created to distribute text content encoded in the 7-bit ASCII character set. With {{the help of}} programs that encode 8-bit values <b>into</b> <b>ASCII,</b> it became practical to distribute binary files as content. Binary posts, due to their size and often-dubious copyright status, were in time restricted to specific newsgroups, {{making it easier for}} administrators to allow or disallow the traffic.|$|R

Originally, Aoyama entered the first novel in the series <b>into</b> <b>ASCII</b> Media Works' 15th Dengeki Novel Prize in 2008 and the novel won the Silver Prize.

50|$|The {{digital signage}} system {{operated}} on an Amiga 2000 computer system running Response Television software from the Response Television Corporation of Iowa City, Iowa. Using a device {{similar to a}} modem, home viewers' touch tones were converted <b>into</b> <b>ASCII</b> data that the Amiga could use to call up specific screens. Screens were created on an Amiga 1200 system which served as a backup computer. Background music was provided by local public radio stations.|$|R
5000|$|Bob Bemer {{introduced}} the [...] "\" [...] character <b>into</b> <b>ASCII</b> on September 18, 1961, {{as the result}} of character frequency studies. In particular the \ was introduced so that the ALGOL boolean operators &and; (AND) and &or; (OR) could be composed in ASCII as [...] "/\" [...] and [...] "\/" [...] respectively. Both these operators were included in early versions of the C programming language supplied with Unix V6, Unix V7 and more currently BSD 2.11.|$|R
50|$|BCI2000 is a {{software}} suite for brain-computer interface research. It {{is commonly used}} for data acquisition, stimulus presentation, and brain monitoring applications. BCI2000 supports a variety of data acquisition systems, brain signals, and study/feedback paradigms. During operation, BCI2000 stores data in a common format (BCI2000 native or GDF), along with all relevant event markers and information about system configuration. BCI2000 also includes several tools for data import/conversion (e.g., a routine to load BCI2000 data files directly into Matlab) and export facilities <b>into</b> <b>ASCII.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ćosić uses ASCII {{characters}} (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) as {{the little}} dots or pixels that you find in a print or video image and transforms them <b>into</b> <b>ASCII</b> characters {{to form a new}} image or video image. He created his own software to covert the pixels from still and moving images into ACII. Ćosić has also worked and experimented with moving ASCII, ASCII audio, and ASCII camera.ASCII thoughts relevant to this work are briefly summarized through few fragments of text.|$|R
50|$|The {{incorporation}} of the tilde (~) <b>into</b> <b>ASCII</b> {{is a direct result}} of its appearance as a distinct character on mechanical typewriters in the late nineteenth century. When all character sets were pieces of metal permanently installed, and number of characters much more limited than in typography, the question of which languages and markets required which characters was an important one. Any good typewriter store had a catalog of alternative keyboards that could be specified for machines ordered from the factory.|$|R

5000|$|Vuk Ćosić, a Slovanian artist {{trained in}} archaeology, is among {{one of the}} {{pioneering}} New Media artists. [...] He also coined the term net art.

It {{is not a new}} practice for artists prior to the 90s to construct images using this method, and these images can be made manually or by using software that converts images <b>into</b> <b>ASCII</b> characters. Cosic then incorporates the use of films and television programs to convert these images into animation with a retro-futuristic aesthetic.|$|R

5000|$|ITRANS is a {{lossless}} transliteration {{scheme of}} Devanagari <b>into</b> <b>ASCII</b> that {{is widely used}} on Usenet. It {{is an extension of}} the Harvard-Kyoto scheme. In ITRANS, the word devanāgarī is written [...] "devanaagarii" [...] or [...] "devanAgarI". ITRANS is associated with an application of the same name that enables typesetting in Indic scripts. The user inputs in Roman letters and the ITRANS pre-processor translates the Roman letters into Devanagari (or other Indic languages). The latest version of ITRANS is version 5.30 released in July, 2001. It is similar to Velthius system and was created by Avinash Chopde to help print various Indic scripts with personal computers.|$|R

50|$|A font {{is a set}} of {{character}} shapes, or glyphs. For a computer to use a font, each glyph must be assigned a code point in a character set.

Not all of the glyphs of OCR-A fit <b>into</b> <b>ASCII,</b> and for five of the characters there were alternate glyphs, which might have suggested the need for a second font. However, for convenience and efficiency all of the glyphs were expected to be accessible in a single font using ASCII coding, with the additional characters placed at coding points that would otherwise have been unused.|$|R
