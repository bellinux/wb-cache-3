5000|$|When the new North Stoneham House was completed, John Willis Fleming {{moved there}} and leased South Stoneham House to General Joseph Gubbins until the general's death in 1832. In 1831 {{there was a}} major fire at North Stoneham, and John Willis Fleming {{returned}} to live in South Stoneham House again after Gubbins' death while North Stoneham was rebuilt. When this was completed in 1834 South Stoneham House was again advertised to let, and again in 1843. Mrs Charlotte Maria Beckford leased the property and died at South Stoneham House in 1854, after which Thomas Willis Fleming (second son of John) moved in. He purchased the property from his elder brother in 1857 and lived there until 1861. The Willis Flemings sold South Stoneham House for £20,000 in 1875 (or 1878 according to some sources), to Captain Thomas Davison (or Daveson). Included in the sale catalogue issued on 23 November 1875 was Wood Mill (still standing and operating as an outdoor activities centre as of 2013), Gascon Cottage, and land for building.

The house was advertised for let again in 1843 after which Mrs Charlotte Maria Beckford, who had lived at Chawton House and was acquainted with novelist Jane Austen from their mutual time in Chawton, leased South Stoneham House with her sister, Miss Lucy Middleton. Beckford died at South Stoneham House at the age of 86 on 25 Jun 1854, and Thomas Willis Fleming (second son of John) moved in. He purchased the property from his elder brother in 1857 and lived there until 1860/61. At this point they leased the property to W. C. Standish. The Willis Flemings put the house up for sale in 1875 and sold South Stoneham House for £20,000 in 1878, to Captain Thomas Davison (or Daveson).

5000|$|In {{the case}} the New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled that [...] "an {{unrecorded}} deed of lands voluntarily given up, and cancelled {{by the parties}} to it, with intent to revest the estate in the grantor, as between them and as to all subsequent claimaints under them, operates as a <b>reconveyance,</b> and revests the estate in the grantor." ...|$|E
5000|$|A <b>reconveyance</b> {{arrangement}} has two elements: (i) A sale, mortgage, lien, encumbrance or {{any other}} method which allows an “equity purchaser” to obtain legal or equitable title to {{all or part of}} the property; and (ii) Some agreement or promise to the “equity seller” that he/she can regain ownership of the property (e.g., the purchase agreement, option to purchase, lease, etc.) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{solution}} was to merge the latter-day wadset and gage for years into a single transaction embodied in two instruments: (1) the absolute conveyance (the charter) in fee or for years to the lender; (2) an indenture or bond (the defeasance) reciting the loan and providing {{that if it was}} repaid the land would reinvest in the borrower, but if not the lender would retain title. If repaid on time, the lender would reinvest title using a <b>reconveyance</b> deed. This was the mortgage by conveyance (aka mortgage in fee) or, when written, the mortgage by charter and <b>reconveyance</b> and took the form of a feoffment, bargain and sale, or lease and release. Since the lender did not necessarily enter into possession, had rights of action, and covenanted a right of reversion on the borrower, the mortgage was a proper collateral security. Thus, a mortgage was on its face an absolute conveyance of a fee simple estate, but was in fact conditional, and would be of no effect if certain conditions were met.|$|E
50|$|However, if the {{borrower}} {{was a single}} day late in repaying the debt, he forfeited his land to the lender while still remaining liable for the debt. Increasingly the courts of equity began to protect {{the borrower}}'s interests, so that a borrower came to have under Sir Francis Bacon (1617-21) an absolute right to insist on <b>reconveyance</b> on redemption even if past due. This right of the borrower {{is known as the}} equity of redemption.|$|E
50|$|Private Transfer Fees (also {{known as}} <b>Reconveyance</b> Fees, Capital Recovery Fees, Residential Transfer Fees, and Transfer Fee Covenants) are a fee charged by US {{developers}} and paid by homeowners that are inserted into home sale contracts. The fees are {{filed in the}} public record, run anywhere from 20 years to perpetuity, and require up to a 1% fee to be paid at the final closing of a property each time the property sells, by either the buyer or seller.|$|E
50|$|The {{short answer}} to {{all this is that}} Mr. Peugh owed the money he had {{borrowed}} from Davis. What he is now claiming in the original suit is the right to pay the money and have a <b>reconveyance</b> of the land. Nothing hindered during all this time that he should pay this money, and if, as he alleges, Davis denied his right to do so, then he should have made a regular and lawful tender of the amount due.|$|E

5000|$|A deed {{of trust}} is {{normally}} recorded with the recorder or county clerk {{for the county}} where the property is located as evidence of and security for the debt.

[...] When the debt is fully paid, the beneficiary is required by law to promptly direct the trustee to transfer the property back to the trustor by <b>reconveyance,</b> thus releasing the security for the debt.|$|E
50|$|The Privy Council {{approved}} the establishment charter on June 9, 1732, {{and for the}} next two decades the council of trustees governed the province, with the aid of annual subsidies from Parliament. However, after many difficulties and the departure of Oglethorpe, the trustees proved unable to manage the proprietary colony, and on June 23, 1752, they submitted a deed of <b>reconveyance</b> to the crown, one year before the expiration of the charter. On January 7, 1755, Georgia officially ceased to be a proprietary colony and became a crown colony.|$|E
5000|$|The {{trustees}} {{of a settlement}} advanced the trust money on the security of real property which was conveyed {{to them by the}} mortgagor, the mortgage deed noticing the trust. The surviving trustee of the settlement afterwards reconveyed part of the property to the mortgagor on payment of part of the mortgage money, which he appropriated. The mortgagor then conveyed that part of the property to new mortgagees, concealing, with the connivance of the trustee, both the prior mortgage and the <b>reconveyance.</b> When the fraud was discovered, the cestuis que trust under the settlement filed a bill against the new mortgagees claiming priority: ...|$|E
5000|$|Held, {{that the}} Court would not {{interfere}} {{to take away}} the legal estate which passed to the new mortgagees under the <b>reconveyance.</b> The trustees of a settlement advanced the trust money on the security of real property which was conveyed to them by the mortgagor, the mortgage deed noticing the trust. The surviving trustee afterwards induced the mortgagor to execute a deed by which the mortgaged property purported to be conveyed to the trustee as on a purchase by him, though no money in fact passed. The trustee then, concealing the prior mortgage, and shewing title under the pretended purchase deed, conveyed the property to a mortgagee without notice: ...|$|E
5000|$|Ideally, {{assuming}} a loan is properly paid back on time, a MERS loan needs only two documents to be recorded: the original mortgage or deed of trust naming Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., and a <b>reconveyance</b> {{of the mortgage}} or deed of trust back to the borrower (thus merging legal and equitable title). If all entities along the way are MERSCORP Holdings, Inc. members, then all intermediate transfers between those points are tracked only on the MERS system, and the entity who holds the loan at the end merely records the <b>reconveyance</b> as an agent for MERSCORP Holdings, Inc. (Notice how MERS is both (1) an agent for the original lender, and then (2) the final lender acts as an agent for MERSCORP Holdings, Inc.; this is why MERS' critics frequently attack it as [...] "two-faced.") If the borrower defaults, the loan servicer will record an assignment on behalf of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. to the real party in interest (i.e., an investment bank in its capacity as trustee for a MBS) and initiate foreclosure. Whereas before the MERS system that last assignment would always have been recorded {{at the time the}} MBS was created, the MERS system enabled banks to avoid having to record it unless and until (1) foreclosure became necessary or (2) the loan was sold by the MBS trustee to an entity outside of the MERS system owned by MERSCORP Holdings, Inc. If the loan performs to the very end, the assignment never needs to be recorded.|$|E

40|$|The {{important}} {{distinctions between}} unilateral and bilateral contracts are slowly coming to be recognized. The case of Brackenbury V. Hodgkin (1917, Me.) 1 O 2 Atl. 106 affords {{an excellent opportunity}} for setting forth some of these distinctions. The exact words used by the parties are not given in the opinion, but the facts are reported by the court substantially as follows: The defendant wrote a letter to, her son-in-law, the plaintiff, offering that if he would move from Missouri to Maine and would care for the defendant during her life, he should have the ownership of the home place after the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s death {{and the use of}} it during her life. The plaintiff moved as requested and cared for the defendant for a few weeks. Trouble ensued, caused, as the court finds, by the unreasonable demands and bad disposition of the defendant, whereupon she conveyed the premises to her son-a co-defendant. The plaintiff filed a bill in equity to compel a <b>reconveyance</b> from the son to his mother, to restrain theprosecution of a statutory ejectment suit brought by the son, and to obtain a decree that the mother should hold the land in trust for the plaintiff. The relief asked was granted in full...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims to {{introduce}} the theoretical concept of stance, as an aspect of interpersonal meaning, into the discipline of Translation Studies and to explore the reproduction of stance in translations of a heavily opinionated political genre commissioned by newspapers. It seeks to provide an account of how patterns of stance are conveyed in newspaper opinion articles on the ‘Arab Spring’ originally published in English in the Washington Post and the New York Times and then how these patterns are re-conveyed in full translations of these articles for two quality Arabic-language newspapers with divergent editorial policies: Al-Ghad and Al-Ittihad. A triangulation of methods is employed for providing a coherent analysis of stance at different levels: lexico-grammatical, textual, and contextual. Accordingly, the methodology chosen {{for the purposes of}} the study is a combination of corpus- and discourse-analytical methods that operate within the tradition of descriptive translation studies. The former is drawn from the lexicogrammatical framework of stance (Biber et al., 1999; Biber, 2006), while the latter is drawn from appraisal theory (Martin and White, 2005). Also, the combined methodology is complemented by some aspects of Fairclough’s model of critical discourse analysis (1992, 1995 a) and Baker’s narrative theory (2006), which, to varying degrees, allow for the contextualisation of the findings and the explanation of translational behaviour. The main contribution of the thesis is that it introduces a new theoretical concept into the field – the concept of stance. This has not previously been approached within translation studies, although it has been high on the research agenda for the past two decades or so within the field of linguistics and its neighbouring disciplines. Also, the thesis has designed and tested a new combined theoretical approach to analyse this phenomenon within the tradition of descriptive translation studies. Moreover, this thesis contributes to the field as well by addressing a new form of shifts in translation, namely shift in stance. The examination of the conveyance and <b>reconveyance</b> of stance reveals that significant shifts in stance occurred in the Arabic translations produced by Al-Ghad and Al-Ittihad. These shifts result in the weakening, accentuation, and entire loss of original stance...|$|E
