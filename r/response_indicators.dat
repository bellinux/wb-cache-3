5000|$|A common {{framework}} {{spearheaded by}} the European Environment Agency [...] is the “DPSIR” or “drivers, pressures, state, impact, response” framework. Drivers and pressures are {{indicators of the}} human activities and resulting pressures on the environment {{in the form of}} pollution or land-use change, for example. State and impact indicators are the resulting conditions in the environment and the implications for the health of ecosystems and humans. The <b>response</b> <b>indicators</b> measure the reaction of human society to the environmental issue. Criteria tend to focus on three key areas - scientific credibility, policy/social relevance and practical monitoring and data requirements. [...] Environmental indicators are used by governments, non-government organizations, community groups and research institutions to see if environmental objectives are being met, to communicate the state of the environment to the general public and decision makers and as a diagnostic tool through detecting trends in the environment.|$|E

50|$|For its {{predecessor}} I-SPY 1, 10 cancer centers and the National Cancer Institute (NCI SPORE {{program and the}} NCI Cooperative groups) collaborated to identify <b>response</b> <b>indicators</b> that would best predict survival for women with high-risk breast cancer. During 2002-2006, the study monitored 237 patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy before surgery. Iterative MRI and tissue samples monitored the biology of patients to chemotherapy given in a neoadjuvant setting, or presurgical setting. Evaluating chemotherapy's direct impact on tumor tissue took much less time than monitoring outcomes in thousands of patients over long time periods. The approach helped to standardize the imaging and tumor sampling processes, and led to miniaturized assays. Key findings included that tumor response was a good predictor of patient survival, and that tumor shrinkage during treatment was a good predictor of long-term outcome. Importantly, {{the vast majority of}} tumors identified as high risk by molecular signature. However, heterogeneity within this group of women and measuring response within tumor subtypes was more informative than viewing the group as a whole. Within genetic signatures, level of response to treatment appears to be a reasonable predictor of outcome. Additionally, its shared database has furthered the understanding of drug response and generated new targets and agents for subsequent testing.|$|E

These results showed the feasibility of capturing bone scintigraphy data as a single quantitative measure and thereby allowing bone scans to be explored as imaging biomarkers.

Methods: 60 patients with intestinal obstruction who underwent surgical treatment in our hospital between February 2013 and July 2016 were selected as the research subjects and divided into the control group (n= 34) who received conventional surgical treatment and the observation group (n= 26) who received surgery combined with perioperative r-hGH treatment.

40|$|Often the {{probability}} of responding depends directly on the outcome value. This case can be treated by postulating a parametric model for {{the distribution of the}} outcomes before nonresponse and a model for the response mechanism.

Modeling the distribution of the outcomes before nonresponse, however, can be problematic since no data is available from this distribution.

[...] However, the problem with this assertion in terms of the flow-mediated <b>response</b> <b>indicator</b> of endothelial dysfunction is that a morphological characteristic of atherosclerosis (baseline artery size) is inherent in the calculation of percentage flow-mediated dilation. Endothelial dysfunction is associated with reduced anticoagulant properties as well as increased adhesion molecule expression, chemokine and other cytokine release, as well as reactive oxygen species production from the endothelium. This leads to inflammation and myofibroblast migration and proliferation inside the vessel all of which play important roles in the development of atherosclerosis.|$|R

40|$|Indicators {{are needed}} to support the {{implementation}} of an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF), by providing information {{on the state of}} the ecosystem, the extent and intensity of effort or mortality and the progress of management in relation to objectives. Here, I review recent work on the development, selection and application of indicators and consider how indicators might support an EAF. Indicators should guide the management of fishing activities that have led to, or are most likely to lead to, unsustainable impacts on ecosystem components or attributes. The numbers and types of indicators used to support an EAF will vary among management regions, depending on resources available for monitoring and enforcement, and actual and potential fishing impacts. State indicators provide feedback on the state of ecosystem components or attributes and the extent to which management objectives, which usually relate to state, are met. State can only be managed if the relationships with fishing (pressure) and management (response) are known. Predicting such relationships is fundamental to developing a management system that supports the achievement of objectives. In a management framework supported by pressure, state and <b>response</b> <b>indicators,</b> the relationship between the value of an indicator and a target or limit reference point, reference trajectory or direction provides guidance on the management action to take. Values of pressure, state and <b>response</b> <b>indicators</b> may be affected by measurement, process, model and estimation error and thus different indicators, and the same indicators measured at different scales and in different ways, will detect true trends on different timescales. Managers can use several methods to estimate the effects of error on the probability of detecting true trends and/or to account for error when setting reference points, trajectories and directions. Given the high noise to signal ratio in many state indicators, pressure and <b>response</b> <b>indicators</b> would often guide short-term management decision making more effectively, with state indicators providing longer-term policy-focused feedback on the effects of management action...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{hypothesis}} that higher levels of corruption are detrimental to environmental sustainability. It does this by employing the Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI) and its component variables and indicators as promoted by the World Economic Forum and the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) created by Transparency International (TI). Both the CPI and ESI were shown to be statistically significantly related to income (proxied as GDP/capita) such that environmental sustainability declined with decreasing income while corruption worsened. The ESI for 2002 was also divided into indicators representing pressure, state, impact and response (i. e., the PSIR framework), and each of these were regressed onto a &# 8216;residual CPI&# 8217; (CPI of 2002 with the influence of income removed).

The only statistically significant relationships with &# 8216;residual CPI&# 8217; were for those of the <b>response</b> <b>indicators</b> of the ESI, although even here the R 2 values were low (< 20 %).

Methods: A total of 60 elderly patients intended to electively receive fiberoptic bronchoscopy and treatment under general anesthesia in our hospital were selected for study and according to different ways of anesthesia. They were divided into group A (propofol combined with sufentanil anesthesia), group B (0. 25 μg/ kg dexmedetomidine combined with propofol and sufentanil anesthesia), group C (0. 5 μg/kg dexmedetomidine combined with propofol and sufentanil anesthesia), group D (0. 75 μg/kg dexmedetomidine combined with propofol and sufentanil anesthesia) and group E (1. 0 μg/kg dexmedetomidine combined with propofol and sufentanil anesthesia).
