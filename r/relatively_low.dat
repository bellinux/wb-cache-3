5|$|Beryllium is a steel {{gray and}} hard metal that is brittle at room {{temperature}} and has a close-packed hexagonal crystal structure. It has exceptional stiffness (Young's modulus 287 GPa) and a reasonably high melting point. The modulus of elasticity of beryllium is approximately 50% {{greater than that of}} steel. The combination of this modulus and a <b>relatively</b> <b>low</b> density results in an unusually fast sound conduction speed in beryllium – about 12.9km/s at ambient conditions. Other significant properties are high specific heat (1925 J·kg−1·K−1) and thermal conductivity (216 W·m−1·K−1), which make beryllium the metal with the best heat dissipation characteristics per unit weight. In combination with the <b>relatively</b> <b>low</b> coefficient of linear thermal expansion (11.4×10−6 K−1), these characteristics result in a unique stability under conditions of thermal loading.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: While {{numerous}} {{studies have examined the}} determinants of trading volume, we document new evidence that stocks with <b>relatively</b> high (<b>low)</b> turnover in a given year tend to maintain <b>relatively</b> high (<b>low)</b> turnover for the subsequent 20 years. This persistent preference for trading high turnover stocks suggests that investors have strong liquidity preference. To further show that investor trading preference on individual firms is largely formed very early on when their stocks became publicly traded, we use initial turnover and find that it dominates all the previously identified trading volume determinants in explaining future turnover. Our findings imply that Amihud and Mendelson‟s (1986) clientele effect is very persistent, i. e., short-term investors persistently trade liquidity stocks, while long-term investors persistently hold illiquid stocks. Also, Booth and Chua‟s (1996) liquidity-purchasing theory of IPO underpricng is relevant because initial turnover has long-lasting impacts on future liquidity...|$|R

The Marcellus has a <b>relatively</b> <b>low</b> density, and these shales {{may not be}} chemically compatible with some drilling fluids. The shale is relatively fragile, and may fracture under pressure, causing a problem in circulating the drilling fluid back up through the borehole known as lost circulation. The formation may also be under-pressurized, further complicating the drilling process.|$|E

40|$|Catastrophizing and {{inadequate}} coping strategies {{are associated with}} the development and maintenance of chronic pain. These can be targeted in a structured cognitive-behavioural group intervention. Objective: Evaluation of the effectiveness and feasibility of a 6 -session structured cognitive-behavioural group intervention for chronic pain patients. Study group: Participants were 27 chronic pain patients of the Pain Center of the University Medical Center Groningen. Methods: An uncontrolled pilot study. Results: Results demonstrated that this cognitive-behavioural group intervention leads to positive change in catastrophizing and locus of control. Conclusions: It is concluded that a structured cognitive-behavioural group intervention of short duration is a much promising treatment for patients with chronic pain at <b>relatively</b> <b>lows</b> costs. The present results can be seen as an indication that a psychological approach has potential as a useful intervention for chronic pain patients.
