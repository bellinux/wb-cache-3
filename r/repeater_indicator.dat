5000|$|At {{the same}} time as the 420 was released, Jaguar added a chrome side strip and side <b>repeater</b> <b>indicator</b> to the Mark X and a centre bar to its grille. Along with {{alterations}} to the interior, these changes were used to justify renaming it the 420G ("G" [...] for Grand). The Motor magazine of October 1966 referred to the 420G as [...] "still one of the best looking large cars in the world today" [...] and commented on the similarity of its new radiator grille to that of the 420. Given the similarity between both the names and frontal styling of the 420 and 420G, the casual observer might be forgiven for mistaking one for the other.|$|E
50|$|The new {{trapezoidal}} single-frame grille, Bi-Xenon high-intensity {{discharge lamp}} (HID) headlamps, L-shaped tail-lamps, quad exhaust tail pipes, and discrete V8 badging below the side <b>repeater</b> <b>indicators</b> help distinguish the B7 {{from the previous}} B6 model.|$|R
5000|$|The Superb {{received}} a minor facelift in August 2006 incorporating Škoda's new radiator grille, headlights, side <b>repeater</b> <b>indicators</b> {{integrated into the}} door mirrors, and C-shaped tail lights {{in the style of}} Škoda Roomster and latest Škoda Octavia.|$|R
50|$|The {{cumulative}} visual {{changes from}} the first models included a revised front grille and headlights, redesigned front and rear bumpers, oval instead of round side <b>repeater</b> <b>indicators,</b> major changes to the interior and dashboard, redesigned rear light lenses, and a radio aerial repositioned {{from the top of}} the right-hand A-pillar to the middle of the roof, towards the rear.|$|R
50|$|The Series II {{was fitted}} with a subtle bodykit and {{slightly}} different interior trim. It also had other minor changes such as body coloured side mirrors and <b>indicator</b> <b>repeaters</b> on the front guards.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first model}} of FX4 was {{fitted with a}} 2178 cc Austin diesel engine and a Borg-Warner {{automatic}} transmission. In 1961, the manual transmission from the Austin Gipsy was available as an option. From 1962, the Austin 2199 cc petrol engine was available. However, almost all FX4 taxis were fitted with a diesel engine and, until the mid-1970s most had a manual transmission.In 1969, the cab was altered, to offer a new version {{in place of the}} abandoned replacement model and to amend some shortcomings of the original. The original Austins were provided with small rear stop and taillights and roof-mounted turn indicators, commonly known as [...] "bunny ears". On the revised model, the rear wings were modified to accept the taillights and turn indicators from the MkII Austin 1100/1300. Front indicators were also provided below the headlights and <b>repeater</b> <b>indicators</b> fitted to the front wings. The [...] "bunny ears" [...] were abandoned. The interior was also changed, with black vinyl seats and an altered partition to give the driver more legroom.|$|R
50|$|In 1970, the 404 Super Luxe and 404 (8 CV) Comfort are dis{{continue}}d, {{leaving the}} Grand Touring, Break and Family models {{to continue in}} petrol and diesel forms. The Grand Touring receives chrome headlight rims and reversing lights as standard. Wing-mounted <b>indicator</b> <b>repeaters</b> are no longer fitted. New XC7 engine fitted (de-tuned to 73 hp), but with torque equivalent to XC6.|$|R
50|$|The {{facelift}} featured revised {{front and}} rear fascias, new door mirrors with integrated turn <b>indicator</b> <b>repeaters,</b> {{the choice of a}} 2.2 litre diesel with particulate filter, and a new six speed automatic transmission with Jaguar Sequential Shift. The range continued to offer the 2.0 litre diesel, and two V6 petrol engines; 2.5 and 3.0 litre. In some European markets, the petrol engines were no longer marketed.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, the 300 Series {{received}} a major facelift. Amongst other small changes, (optionally body coloured) wrap-around bumpers with the <b>indicator</b> <b>repeaters</b> {{attached to them}} were fitted. Instrumentation changed from Smiths units to VDO. The older Volvo redblock engines in the 360 were upgraded to the low friction B200 unit. Capacities and outputs remained much the same. The carburettor version was designated B200K and the Bosch LE-Jet fuel injected version {{is known as the}} B200E.|$|R
50|$|For the London Motor Show in October 1966 the Mark X {{was renamed}} the Jaguar 420G (not to be {{confused}} with the smaller Jaguar 420). The 420G was distinct from the Mark X only with the addition of a vertical central bar splitting the grille in two, side <b>indicator</b> <b>repeaters</b> on the front wings, and a chrome strip along the wing and door panels (two tone paint schemes were also available with the chrome strip omitted).|$|R
50|$|The second {{generation}} Festiva {{continued to be}} sold in Australia until 2000 when it {{was replaced by the}} Ford Ka. Australian second-generation Festivas have U.S. side marker light cut-outs {{on each side of the}} vehicle (driver-side and passenger-side) at the front and rear. Instead of housing orange reflectors/lights at the front sides and red reflectors/lights at the rear sides, there are non-lit orange reflectors at all four locations. These redundant reflectors, coupled with the orange side <b>indicator</b> <b>repeater</b> (which is not required in the U.S., and was not included on the Aspire) make for a unique side profile.|$|R
50|$|The Canadian {{version of}} the Pony had to be changed {{slightly}} to meet standards of that country. The Pony was released for sale in Canada for the 1984 model year and ended in 1987. Differences between the Canadian Pony versus its European counterparts were 8 km/h bumpers, sealed-beam headlights, side marker lamps instead of <b>indicator</b> <b>repeaters</b> (also in a lower position), and slight alterations in interior instrumentation and trim application. Initial projections for 1984 called for 5000 sales, but the final total was an astounding 25,123, making the Pony one of Canada's best selling cars that year. The Pony was sold until 1987, even while Excels were for sale alongside.|$|R
2500|$|The second batch were {{registered}} {{and used by}} the factory in Northern Ireland, with registration numbers (license plates), AXI 1697, AXI 1698, AXI 1699 and are referred to by enthusiasts as the [...] "AXI cars". These three cars (VINs 5565, 5592 and 5638) differ from the first Wooler-Hodec cars in several ways. These three cars all had roof mounted radio antennas, <b>indicator</b> <b>repeater</b> lights, no side marker lights, white forward-facing door lights, fog-light switch, and textured body rubstrips on the stainless panels. No catalytic converters or Lambda equipment were fitted as British legislation did not require them. VIN 5565 with the registration number AXI 1697 was a fully UK homologated example {{which would have been}} shown at the British motor show at Birmingham, UK in October 1982. It includes a unique rearward-facing twin exhaust, no catalytic converters and the UK specification engine as used by Volvo, but retaining the usual Renault ancillaries. The transmission final drive was also set at 3.88:1 versus the standard 3.44:1. Attention was paid to other unique details such as correctly offset wing mirrors.|$|R
