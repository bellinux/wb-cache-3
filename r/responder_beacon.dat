50|$|Transit-time {{measurement}} underlies most {{radio navigation}} systems for boats and aircraft, for example, radar and the nearly obsolete Long Range Aid to Navigation LORAN-C. For example, in one radar system, pulses of electromagnetic radiation are sent {{out by the}} vehicle (interrogating pulses) and trigger a response from a <b>responder</b> <b>beacon.</b> The time interval between the sending and the receiving of a pulse is monitored and used to determine a distance. In the global positioning system a code of ones and zeros is emitted at a known time from multiple satellites, and their times of arrival are noted at a receiver along with {{the time they were}} sent (encoded in the messages). Assuming the receiver clock can be related to the synchronized clocks on the satellites, the transit time can be found and used to provide the distance to each satellite. Receiver clock error is corrected by combining the data from four satellites.|$|E
40|$|The {{profession}} of a miner {{is one of}} the most dangerous in the world. Among the main causes of fatalities in underground coal mines are the delayed alert of the accident and the lack of information regarding the actual location of the miners after the accident. In an emergency situation (failure or destruction of underground infrastructure), personnel search behind and beneath blockage needs to be performed urgently. However, none of the standard technologies – radio-frequency identification (RFID), Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT), Wi-Fi, emitting cables, which use the stationary technical devices in mines – provide information about the miners location with the necessary precision. The only technology that is able to provide guaranteed delivery of messages to mine personnel, regardless of their location and under any destruction in the mine, is low-frequency radio technology, which is able to operate through the thickness of rocks even if they are wet. The proposed new system for miner localization is based on solving the inverse problem of determining the magnetic field source coordinates using the data of magnetic field measurements. This approach is based on the measurement of the magnetic field radiated by the miner's <b>responder</b> <b>beacon</b> using two fixed and spaced three-component magnetic field receivers and the inverse problem solution. As a result, a working model of the system for miner's beacon search and localization (MILES – MIner's Location Emergency System) was developed and successfully tested. This paper presents the most important aspects of this development and the results of experimental tests...|$|E
50|$|Fug 126: By 1944 the Germans {{were aware}} of the {{operating}} concept of the British Rebecca/Eureka system and the Oboe and G-H systems via captured examples. From this they developed the Baldur system. This was a system or <b>responder</b> <b>beacons</b> working at 2-4 Meters wavelength. The airborne equipment FuG 126 was based on the SN2 radar. Accuracy was +- 100 meters. The system seems to have only deployed in small numbers as bomber operations were ceasing due to the air forces concentration just on fighters and CAS. A variant called FuG162k was produced for single seat fighter (reduced accuracy +- 500 meters) operation but it seems never to have been used.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{feasibility}} study of a smartphone-based SOS system. Compared to other emergency systems the presented system: a) is independent from existing network infrastructure and b) runs on off-the-shelf devices. The presented system exploits Wi-Fi service set identifiers (SSIDs) for the discovery of phones and to convey short emergency messages. It can operate in two setups: either the victims' phones send out a distress signal or the <b>responder's</b> device is <b>beaconing</b> a rescue signal. By means of attaching the responder device to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) the scalability of both setups were compared with each other. Both setups were explored at two different altitudes. This paper concludes with aspects for future work...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Providing ad-hoc {{solutions}} for positioning and tracking of emergency response teams {{is an important}} and safety-critical challenge. Although solutions based on inertial sensing systems are promising, {{they are subject to}} drift. We address the problem of positional drift by having the <b>responders</b> themselves deploy <b>beacons,</b> specifically ultrasound beacons, as they progress into an unknown environment. Our research focuses on a sensor network approach that does not require any pre-deployment of infrastructure. This paper targets two important aspects within the context of providing positioning service for emergency responders namely on how to locate the deployed static beacons, and on how to track the responders by using a combination of ultrasound and inertial measurements. The main contributions of this paper are: (i) characterisation of the errors encountered in an inertial-based pedestrian dead reckoning solution and ultrasound range measurements in a mobile setting, (ii) an algorithm for ultrasound beacon localisation (using multidimensional scaling), (iii) formulation of a Kalman filtering based algorithm for tracking the responder using a combination of ultrasound range and inertial measurements, and (iv) the presented algorithms are evaluated using data collected from real deployments and are compared against an ultra-wideband (UWB) precision location system. Our approach of preventing the drift in inertial estimates by combining with ultrasound measurements are promising and offers a viable solution to providing positioning and tracking support to emergency responders.
