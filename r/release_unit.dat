40|$|Abstract. A {{model for}} the flow of calcium in an atrial heart cell is given by a system of timedependent reaction-diffusion {{equations}} coupled by non-linear reaction terms. Calcium ions enter into the cell at <b>release</b> <b>units</b> distributed throughout the cell. At each position, the probability for calcium to be released increases along with the concentration of calcium, thus creating a feedback loop of waves re-generating themselves repeatedly. To validate the model, simulations on the time scale of several completed waves and on the spatial scale of the entire cell are desirable. This requires long-time studies on spatial meshes that {{need to have a}} high resolution to resolve the positions of the calcium <b>release</b> <b>units</b> throughout the entire cell. high resolution meshes needed to resolve the We detail the development of a special-purpose numerical method and parallel implementation for this problem. Parallel performance studies demonstrate the scalability of the implementation on a distributed-memory cluster.

40|$|Calcium release during excitation-contraction {{coupling}} of {{skeletal muscle}} cells is {{initiated by the}} functional interaction of the exterior membrane and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), mediated by the "mechanical" coupling of ryanodine receptors (RyR) and dihydropyridine receptors (DHPR). RyR is the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2 +) release channel and DHPR is an L-type calcium channel of exterior membranes (surface membrane and T tubules), which acts as the voltage sensor of excitation-contraction coupling.

40|$|AbstractExcitation {{contraction}} (e-c) {{coupling in}} skeletal and cardiac muscles involves {{an interaction between}} specialized junctional domains of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and of exterior membranes (either surface membrane or transverse (T) tubules). This interaction occurs at special structures named calcium <b>release</b> <b>units</b> (CRUs). CRUs contain two proteins essential to e-c coupling: dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs), L-type Ca 2 + channels of exterior membranes; and ryanodine receptors (RyRs), the Ca 2 + release channels of the SR. Special CRUs in cardiac muscle are constituted by SR domains bearing RyRs that are not associated with exterior membranes (the corbular and extended junctional SR or EjSR). Functional groupings of RyRs and DHPRs within calcium <b>release</b> <b>units</b> have been named couplons, and the term is also loosely applied to the EjSR of cardiac muscle. Knowledge of the structure, geometry, and disposition of couplons is essential to understand the mechanism of Ca 2 + release during muscle activation.

40|$|AbstractMuscle fibers release {{large amounts}} of calcium from an {{internal}} compartment, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), during activation. Two proteins {{are involved in this}} process and its control: plasma membrane calcium channels, or dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs), and SR calcium release channels, or ryanodine receptors (RyRs). The two proteins form part of a structural complex, perhaps unique to muscle cells, which allows an interaction between plasma membrane and SR, resulting in calcium release from the latter. The surface–SR interaction {{is a step in the}} coupling between electrical events in the plasma membrane and contraction (excitation–contraction coupling). The structural complexes have been called calcium <b>release</b> <b>units.</b> One key to further understanding the control of calcium homeostasis in muscle is knowledge of how DHPRs and RyRs assemble into calcium <b>release</b> <b>units.</b> We have studied the development of avian myocardium, using immunocytochemistry to locate DHPRs and RyRs and electron microscopy to follow the formation of calcium <b>release</b> <b>units</b> containing feet (RyRs) and large membrane particles (presumably DHPRs). We find that the initial step is a docking of SR vesicles to the plasma membrane, followed by the appearance of feet in the junctional gap between SR and plasma membrane. Feet aggregate in ordered arrays, and the arrays increase in size until they fill the entire junctional gap. Clustering of membrane particles, presumably DHPRs, is apparently coupled to clustering of feet, since the two junction components assemble within patches of membrane of approximately equal size and containing an approximately constant ratio of particles to feet. Thus, despite the fact that no evidence exists for a direct interaction between DHPRs and RyRs in cardiac muscle, some mechanism exists to ensure that the two molecules are clustered in proximity to each other and in the appropriate proportion...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMaurocalcine (MCa), a 33 {{amino acid}} toxin {{obtained}} from scorpion venom, {{has been shown}} to interact with the isolated skeletal-type ryanodine receptor (RyR 1) and to strongly modify its calcium channel gating. In this study, we explored the effects of MCa on RyR 1 in situ to establish whether the functional interaction of RyR 1 with the voltage-sensing dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) would modify the ability of MCa to interact with RyR 1. In developing skeletal muscle cells the addition of MCa into the external medium induced a calcium transient resulting from RyR 1 activation and strongly inhibited the effect of the RyR 1 agonist chloro-m-cresol. In contrast, MCa failed to affect the depolarization-induced Ca(2 +) release. In intact adult fibres MCa did not induce any change in the cytosolic Ca(2 +) concentration. However, when the surface membrane was permeabilized and calcium release events were readily observable, MCa had a time-dependent dual effect: it first increased event frequency, from 0. 060 +/- 0. 002 to 0. 150 +/- 0. 007 sarcomere(- 1) s(- 1), and reduced the amplitude of individual events without modifying their spatial distribution. Later on it induced the appearance of long-lasting events resembling the embers observed in control conditions but having a substantially longer duration. We propose that the functional coupling of DHPRs and RyR 1 s within a Ca(2 +) <b>release</b> <b>unit</b> prevents MCa from either reaching its binding site or from being able to modify the gating not only of the RyR 1 s physically coupled to DHPRs but all RyR 1 s within the Ca(2 +) <b>release</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|E
