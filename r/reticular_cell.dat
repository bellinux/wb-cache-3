40|$|We have {{developed}} a panel of six monoclonal antibodies, ED 10 -ED 15, directed against <b>reticular</b> <b>cells</b> in peripheral lymphoid organs.

40|$|The three {{dimensional}} {{architecture of}} the rat femur bone marrow stroma was observed by scanning electron microscopy. The bone marrow was fixed and vibrated by ultrasonication to dislodge the hematopoietic cells embedded in the meshes of the marrow reticulum. The stromal reticulum was exposed, while its three dimensional architecture was preserved. The marrow stromal reticulum consisted of intersinusoidal <b>reticular</b> <b>cells</b> and perivascular <b>reticular</b> <b>cells</b> (adventitial cells), and {{a small amount of}} reticular fibers. Two types of meshwork were noted in the bone marrow reticulum. Each mesh of one type was the size of one hematopoietic cell. This meshwork consisted of short and broad or stout cytoplasmic processes. A hematopoietic cell was enwrapped by attenuated cytoplasmic sheaths of the <b>reticular</b> <b>cells</b> and sequestered from the surrounding hematopietic cells. The other type of meshwork was composed of straight running, long and slender filopodia of the <b>reticular</b> <b>cells.</b> Several hematopoietic cells were tightly packed in each mesh of the meshwork of this type, thus presenting a polyhedral appearance. Attenuated adventitial cells enveloped the marrow blood vessels, and were connected with each other by their sheath-like cytoplasmic processes but round, variously sized intercellular spaces remained. The intersinusoidal <b>reticular</b> <b>cells</b> extended their processes to the adventitial cells and the adventitial cells also stretched their processes to the intersiusoidal reticulum...|$|R

40|$|SummaryWithin {{secondary}} lymphoid tissues, stromal reticular cells support lymphocyte function, and targeting reticular {{cells is}} a potential strategy for controlling pathogenic lymphocytes in disease. However, the mechanisms that regulate <b>reticular</b> <b>cell</b> function are not well understood. Here we found that during an immune response in lymph nodes, dendritic cells (DCs) maintain <b>reticular</b> <b>cell</b> survival in multiple compartments. DC-derived lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTβR) ligands were critical mediators, and LTβR signaling on reticular cells mediated cell survival by modulating podoplanin (PDPN). PDPN modulated integrin-mediated cell adhesion, which maintained cell survival. This DC-stromal axis maintained lymphocyte survival and the ongoing immune response. Our findings {{provide insight into the}} functions of DCs, LTβR, and PDPN and delineate a DC-stromal axis that can potentially be targeted in autoimmune or lymphoproliferative diseases...|$|E
40|$|<b>Reticular</b> <b>cells</b> and {{follicular}} dendritic cells (FDCs) {{build up}} a framework that underlies the compartmentalization of spleens and lymph nodes. Subpopulations of <b>reticular</b> <b>cells</b> express the smooth-muscle isoform of actin, indicative of a specialized contractile apparatus. We have investigated {{the distribution of the}} actin-binding protein caldesmon in spleen and lymph nodes of mice and rats. Caldesmon modulates contraction and regulates cell motility. Alternative splicing of transcripts from a single gene results in high-molecular-mass isoforms (h-caldesmon) that are predominately expressed by smooth-muscle cells (SMCs), and low-molecular-mass isoforms (l-caldesmon) that are thought to be widely distributed in non-muscle tissues, but the distribution of caldesmon in spleen and lymph nodes has not been reported. We have performed Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry using four different antibodies against caldesmon, among these a newly developed polyclonal antibody directed against recombinant mouse caldesmon. Western blot analysis showed the preponderance of l-caldesmon in spleen and lymph nodes. Our results from immunohistochemistry demonstrate caldesmon in SMCs, as expected, but also in <b>reticular</b> <b>cells</b> and FDCs, and suggest that the isoform highly expressed by <b>reticular</b> <b>cells</b> is l-caldesmon.

40|$|Even with {{prolonged}} antiretroviral therapy (ART), many {{human immunodeficiency}} virus-infected individuals have < 500 CD 4 + T cells/µL, and CD 4 + T cells in lymphoid tissues remain severely depleted, {{due in part}} to fi-brosis of the paracortical T-cell zone (TZ) that impairs homeostatic mechanisms required for T-cell survival. We therefore used antifibrotic therapy in simian immunodeficiency virus-infected rhesus macaques to determine whether decreased TZ fibrosis would improve reconstitution of peripheral and lymphoid CD 4 + T cells. Treat-ment with the antifibrotic drug pirfenidone preserved TZ architecture and was associated with significantly larger populations of CD 4 + T cells in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues. Combining pirfenidone with an ART regimen was associated with greater preservation of CD 4 + T cells than ART alone and was also asso-ciated with higher pirfenidone concentrations. These data support a potential role for antifibrotic drug treat-ment as adjunctive therapy with ART to improve immune reconstitution. Keywords.

40|$|Two {{pathologic}} conditions, <b>reticular</b> <b>cell</b> hyperplasia and amyloidosis, {{were studied}} in {{a strain of}} mice selectively bred for low leukocyte counts (LLC). At the age of 3 to 6 months, 70 % of the mice developed <b>reticular</b> <b>cell</b> hyperplasia in the inguinea lymph nodes, and at 11 to 18 months, about 100 % of them developed amyloidosis in the spleen and in the kidney, liver, and adrenal glands.

Distended rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) cisternae and hypertrophy of RER with or without the simultaneous presence of amyloid fibrils in the reticular cells of the spleen and Kupffer cells of the liver were observed. In this light, we believe that the pathologic conditions are manifestations of immunologic events that are characteristic of the LLC mice with immune deficiency or abnormality in the immune system.

40|$|Human spinal dura and arachnoid, {{obtained}} during neurosurgical operations, {{were studied}} by transmission electron microscopy. The ultrastructure of spinal meninges largely conformed to the morphology of the cranial meninges, but some minor differences were detected. The dura {{was composed of}} an outermost loosely arranged fibroelastic layer, a middle basically fibrous portion and an innermost cellular layer (dural border cell layer). The dural border cell layer was characterised by multiple interdigitating cell processes, no extracellular collagen, significant extracellular spaces and few cell junctions. Paravascular vesiculated nerve profiles were encountered within the fibroadipose epidural tissue. The arachnoid was composed of an outermost portion (arachnoid barrier cell layer), presenting tightly packed cells, numerous tight junctions and no extracellular collagen. In view of its numerous tight junctions, the arachnoid barrier cell layer is considered to represent an effective morphological and physiological meningeal barrier between the cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space and the blood circulation in the dura. The arachnoid barrier layer was always characterised by a distinct continuous basal lamina on its inner surface towards the innermost collagenous portion of the arachnoid (arachnoid <b>reticular</b> <b>cell</b> layer). The interweaving arachnoid trabecular cells within this layer possessed numerous mitochondria and were anchored to the inner surface of the arachnoid barrier cell layer by desmosomes. An additional layer of flattened branching cells was demonstrated along the inner surface of the arachnoid <b>reticular</b> <b>cell</b> layer and assumed to be an "arachnoid border cell layer'.

Although T cell zone reticular cells had lost podoplanin expression, they still formed a functional conduit system and showed enhanced expression of myofibroblastic markers. However, essential immune functions of FRCs, including homeostatic chemokine and interleukin- 7 expression, were impaired. These changes in T cell zone <b>reticular</b> <b>cell</b> function were associated with increased susceptibility to viral infection.

Young mice were injected intravenously with $ sp{ 125 }$I-mAb FDC-M 1, FDC-M 2, FDC-M 3 and then perfused to remove unbound antibody. Quantitative analyses of radioautographic LM sections of femoral bone marrow revealed discrete FDC-labelling throughout bone marrow sections, especially in outer areas near the surrounding bone and intermediate areas, forming both linear arrangements and irregular patches.

In the human species, 'inverted thymuses' contain a considerable amount of lipids in <b>reticular</b> <b>cells</b> that have phagocytized debris of thymocytes destroyed during involution.
