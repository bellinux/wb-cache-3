5|$|The {{combined}} {{grant and}} village-funded restoration included door, window, and roof repairs, along with {{interior and exterior}} <b>repainting.</b> The <b>repainting</b> matched the station's 1940s color scheme. On April 24, 2007, the National Park Service presented a plaque commemorating the restoration project at the station. In early May 2007, with the restoration completed, Ambler's Texaco Gas Station reopened as a visitor's center.|$|E

5000|$|The term <b>repaint</b> also {{refers to}} fashion dolls whose {{original}} manufacturer face paint is removed and then <b>repainted</b> by an artist. <b>Repaint</b> styles include highly realistic treatments, fantasy makeovers, and celebrity likenesses. These dolls are often OOAK, although some artists create <b>repaints</b> in small limited editions.|$|R

5|$|British Railways {{undertook}} a massive programme to establish itself by <b>repainting</b> all its locomotives {{with their new}} BR numbers and replacing their previous corporate identity with its own. Gone were the tenders proclaiming the railway companies' logos, emblems and even coats of arms, {{to be replaced by}} the stark 'BRITISH RAILWAYS' lettering. The enormity of this task meant that the necessary <b>repainting</b> was not necessarily carried out to coincide with an overall repaint. For the Coronation Class, all locomotives had been through this process by the end of 1948 except for Nos. 6223, 6238, 6248, 6250, and 6252–6255, a total of 29 locomotives. Only thirteen locomotives out of the 29 received new liveries to accompany their renumbering.|$|E
5|$|The {{observatory}} is {{no longer}} used for research purposes, though the telescope is still used as a teaching tool in the university's astronomy classes. In addition, a University of Illinois student astronomy organization uses the telescope. The observatory dome underwent a renovation that included <b>repainting</b> in 1996.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, a fire almost {{destroyed}} {{the upper level}} of the school building, but the congregation repaired the damage. Another renovation was begun in 1928, and included installing illuminated stained glass over the ark and bronze memorial tablets {{at the rear of}} the sanctuary, and <b>repainting</b> the sanctuary walls and columns in a trompe-l'œil manner imitating Jerusalem stone and marble.|$|E

5|$|Seasons {{may play}} a role in some regions. A {{dramatic}} change in colour and texture is created by seasonal snowy conditions in northern latitudes, necessitating <b>repainting</b> of vehicles and separate snow oversuits. The Eastern and northern European countries have a tradition for separate winter uniforms rather than oversuits. During the Second World War, the Waffen-SS went a step further, developing reversible uniforms with separate schemes for summer and autumn, as well as white winter oversuits.|$|E
5|$|Since 2009, VR {{has been}} <b>repainting</b> its fleet in new colours {{according}} to its changed visual identity. Green colour has replaced red, and each car now has two green parallelograms instead of one larger figure between carriages. Artwork showcasing Finnish nature decorates them. , Sm3 units 7x01 to 7x04, 7x06 to 7x10 and 7x12 have been repainted in the new livery.|$|E
5|$|The {{portrayal}} of nudes was officially discouraged in 17th-century Spain. Works could be seized or <b>repainting</b> {{demanded by the}} Inquisition, and artists who painted licentious or immoral works were often excommunicated, fined, or banished from Spain for a year. However, within intellectual and aristocratic circles, the aims of art were believed to supersede questions of morality, and there were many, generally mythological, nudes in private collections.|$|E
50|$|The {{series was}} {{primarily}} <b>repaints</b> of non-show Beast Wars figures and <b>repaints</b> of Generation 2 figures, including two unreleased Autoroller figures {{and the black}} Dreadwing/Smokecreen <b>repaint,</b> planned for the cancelled 1996 assortment of figures. In both cases the items were recolored and slightly remolded; <b>repainted</b> versions of five of the Seacons also served as new Predacon characters.|$|R

5|$|The urban {{regeneration}} company Clydebank Re-Built started a £3.75m restoration project in 2005, and the crane {{opened to the}} public in August 2007. The structure was shot-blasted to remove old paint and rust, allowing repairs to be undertaken before <b>repainting.</b> A lift for visitors to ascend to the jib and an emergency evacuation stair were installed, along with a wire mesh around the viewing area and floodlights to illuminate the crane at night.|$|E
5|$|With the new {{roller coaster}} The Smiler opening in 2013, Oblivion {{is no longer}} the only coaster in X Sector, as it had been since Black Hole's closure in 2005. In late January/early February 2013, Alton Towers began a process of <b>repainting</b> Oblivion's fading grey track, which had become very worn since opening in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Flying Scotsman {{returned}} to Britain in 1990 and continued {{working on the}} main line until its mainline certificate expired in 1993. 4472 then toured preserved railways. To raise funds for its upcoming overhaul it was {{returned to}} BR condition with the refitting of the German-style smoke deflectors and double chimney, and <b>repainting</b> in BR Brunswick green. By 1995 it was in pieces at Southall Railway Centre in West London, owned by a consortium that included McAlpine as well as music guru and railway enthusiast Pete Waterman.|$|E

50|$|DXs 5431 and 5517 {{had been}} <b>repainted</b> into the livery, but yellow cabs instead of grey. Both locos were <b>repainted</b> in the {{original}} version before being <b>repainted</b> in this variation, and later they had black chutes fitted {{on the right side}} of the long-hood.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, {{a set of}} Wal-Mart-exclusive toys sold {{simply as}} Transformers: Dinobots {{featured}} <b>repaints</b> of Beast Wars molds as six Dinobots. One of the Dinobots sets included Snarl (a <b>repaint</b> of Beast Wars Neo Saberback) and Sludge (a <b>repaint</b> of Beast Wars Neo Sling).|$|R
5|$|In 2002, Ruth Rosiene, a {{descendant}} of the Perkins and Ashlawn's owner, was featured in an article by The Day. Rosiene had been maintaining the house for years, which required <b>repainting</b> every four or five years. A photo in the article shows the latch on the door that was described as possibly original. The article notes that the original sliding shutters are now absent, whereas the original nomination form from 1979 stated they were not installed.|$|E
5|$|The museum {{stresses}} that the paintings {{be kept in}} good condition by whoever has them. Museum director, Anne Hawley has stated that the works {{should be kept in}} a stable environment of 50% humidity and 70°F. Additionally, they should be kept away from light and stored in acid-free paper. Hawley also noted to avoid rolling the paintings, which will crack the paint. If these guidelines are not followed, the paintings could be damaged and drop in value. More <b>repainting</b> would need to be done too, which hurts the paintings' integrity.|$|E
5|$|The {{principle}} of varying coloration either rapidly {{or with the}} changing seasons has military applications. Active camouflage could in theory make use of both dynamic colour change and counterillumination. Simple techniques such as changing uniforms and <b>repainting</b> vehicles for winter have been in use since the Second World War. In 2011, BAE Systems announced their Adaptiv infrared camouflage technology. It uses about 1000 hexagonal panels to cover the sides of a tank. The Peltier plate panels are heated and cooled to match either the vehicle's surroundings (crypsis), or an object such as a car (mimesis), when viewed in infrared.|$|E
5000|$|Longarm was a <b>repaint</b> of his Armada toy {{and came}} {{packaged}} {{with his new}} Autobot partner Prowl (who was a <b>repaint</b> of the Armada Red Alert toy), Starscream and Zapmaster; both <b>repaints</b> of their original Armada toys. This package was sold at Sam's Club stores.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>repaint</b> is a toy {{that was}} created entirely from a mold was {{previously}} available; however, {{the colors of the}} plastic and/or the paint operations have been changed. <b>Repaints</b> differ from redecos in that <b>repaints</b> do not alter the actual placement of paint applications while redecos do.|$|R
25|$|Some {{units have}} been <b>repainted</b> {{in the green}} GWR livery, without any {{interior}} refurbishment. The first unit <b>repainted</b> was 143603 in July 2017.|$|R
5|$|The restorers {{washed the}} {{surfaces}} {{using a variety}} of solvents. Distilled water was used wherever possible to remove soot and dissolve water-soluble gums. Retouching and <b>repainting</b> that had been part of previous later restorations were removed with a gelatinous solvent, applied in several stages for measured times, and washed with distilled water. Salt efflorescences of calcium carbonate were treated by the application of a solution of dimethylformamide. The final step was the application of a weak solution of acrylic polymer to consolidate and protect the surface, and further washing.|$|E
5|$|Between 1710 and 1713 {{a further}} {{restoration}} {{was carried out}} by the painter Annibale Mazzuoli and his son. They used sponges dipped in Greek wine which Colalucci suggests was necessitated by the accretion of grime caused by soot and dirt trapped in the oily deposits of the previous restoration. Mazzuoli then worked over the ceiling, according to Colalucci, strengthening the contrasts by overpainting details. They also repainted some areas the colours of which were lost because of the efflorescence of salts. Areas of <b>repainting</b> were hatched or treated with a linear brushstroke. Colalucci states that Mazzuoli also applied a great deal of glue varnish. The restoration concentrated on the ceiling and less attention was paid to the lunettes.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the orders}} of {{the captain of the}} Barracouta, Waddell {{immediately}} converted the warship back to a merchant ship, storing her cannon below, discharging all arms, and <b>repainting</b> the hull. At this point, Waddell decided to sail back to England and surrender the Shenandoah in Liverpool. Surrendering in an American port carried the certainty of facing a court with a Union point of view and the very real risk of a trial for piracy, for which he and the crew could be hanged. Sailing south around Cape Horn and staying well off shore to avoid shipping that might report Shenandoah's position, they saw no land for another 9,000 miles until they arrived back in England, having logged a total of over 58,000 miles around the world in a year's travel—the only Confederate ship to circumnavigate the globe.|$|E
