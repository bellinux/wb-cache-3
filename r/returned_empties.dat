5000|$|In essence this {{remained}} the situation into the 1960s. Surrounding lines and industries {{continued to be}} nibbled away, but Lowca met need and the LLR made that possible. The nationalisation of railways and coal in the 1940s had little impact on the LLR. The line continued to be worked by the USC, with NCB locos at Lowca itself. In 1950 two 0-6-0ST locomotives were bought new by the USC and formed the line's staple motive power until dieselisation in 1965. After this point the line's staple motive power was Yorkshire Engine Company 0-4-0 diesel electrics, typically paired back-to-back. Harrington No. 10 Pit at Lowca remained steam-worked until it closed in 1968, with a fleet of [...] "Austerity" [...] 0-6-0STs. These worked the pit environs and took incoming coal from British Railways' locomotives on the zig-zag at Bain's Siding and <b>returned</b> <b>empties</b> there for BR to take away to Solway Colliery, Workington for refilling.|$|E
