40|$|A {{series of}} tests was {{undertaken}} on a recirculation scheme in a deep level gold mine to establish the effect of controlled recirculation of the mine ventilation air on blast contaminant dissipation. Clarification was needed {{as to whether the}} existing <b>re-entry</b> <b>interval</b> of three hours would have to be extended with the introduction of controlled recirculation. The <b>re-entry</b> <b>interval</b> is a time interval, after blasting, stipulated by the Inspector of Mines during which the workings are being cleared of blast contaminants and during which time no persons are permitted tc enter the workings. The fresh and recirculated air flow rates were varied and their effects on blast contaminant dissipation measured. Gas concentrations of the oxides of nitrogen (N 0 X) and carbon monoxide were monitored continuously in the return air. Dust levels were monitored in the return air from two hours before the blast to four hours after the blast. Two gas models (mixed-volume and plug-flow) and residence time analysis were used to analyse the data. In all the tests, the critical blast contaminant for determining the <b>re-entry</b> <b>interval</b> was found to be NO*. In addition, the following parameters affected the re-entry interval; the amount of explosives ignited daily, the volume of the workings into which the NO* is dissipated by the ventilating air, the time taken for air to complete one circuit (the cycle time), leakage and short circuiting of air, and the fresh air flow rate. The recirculated air flow rate was found to have negligible effect on the <b>re-entry</b> <b>interval...</b>|$|E
40|$|In 12 {{greenhouses}} for chrysanthemum {{culture in}} the Netherlands, dermal exposure to hand and forearms, and respiratory exposure to chlorothalonil during harvesting activities have been measured. Two harvesting techniques were compared, during which respectively the highest and lowest levels of exposure were expected. The difference between both techniques was the way some actions (removing leaves and clods) were carried out: manually or automatically with a harvesting machine. It was observed that dermal exposure differed for the various harvesting techniques. The exposure was on average 3. 6 mg/h for manual harvesting, and 1. 1 mg/h for automatic harvesting. Re-entry time had a large influence on exposure. Working after a relatively short <b>re-entry</b> <b>interval</b> (11 - 17 days) resulted in an exposure of about a factor 6 to 9 higher than after a long <b>re-entry</b> <b>interval</b> (32 - 56 days).

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{undertaken}} {{to establish the}} extent of pesticide exposure in a farming community. Cholinesterase (ChE) activity in whole blood {{was used as a}} marker for assessing exposure to pesticides. Complete data were gathered for 63 farmers at Akumadan (exposed) and 58 control subjects at Tono, both prominent vegetable farming communities in Ghana, by means of a questionnaire and blood cholinesterase analyses (acetylcholine-assay). Although whole blood ChE was significantly lower in the exposed than the control participants, it was not significantly correlated with either confounders of age, sex, body weight, and height or high risks practices. The high risks practices revealed during the survey included lack of use of personal protective clothing, short <b>re-entry</b> <b>intervals,</b> and wrong direction of spraying of pesticides by hand or knapsack sprayer. About 97 % of exposed participants had experienced symptoms attributable to pesticide exposure. The frequent symptoms were reported as weakness and headache. There is the need to review safety precautions in the use and application of pesticides in Ghana...|$|R
40|$|SOFEA © (SOil Fumigant Exposure Assessment system) is a {{recently}} developed stochastic numerical modeling tool for evaluating and managing human inhalation exposure potential {{associated with the}} use of soil fumigants. SOFEA calculates fumigant concentrations in air arising from volatility losses from treated fields for entire agricultural regions using multiple transient source terms (treated fields), GIS information, agronomic specific variables, user specified buffer zones and field <b>re-entry</b> <b>intervals.</b> A modified version of the USEPA Industrial Source Complex Short Term model (ISCST 3) is used for air dispersion calculations. SOFEA uses field observed (or numerically generated) fumigant flux profiles from soil as transient source terms for both shank injection and drip-irrigation applications. Reference flux observations are scaled based upon depth of incorporation and the time of year to map the complete flux response surface from appropriate field/numerical observations. Weather information, field size, application date, application rate, application type, soil incorporation depth, pesticide degradation rates in air, tarp presence, field retreatment, and other sensitive parameters are varied stochastically using Monte Carlo techniques to mimic region and crop specific agronomic practices. Agricultural regions up to 19, 000 mi 2 can be simulated for temporal periods ranging from 1 day to more than 70 years for the purpose of assessing acute, sub-chronic, or chronic exposure profiles. Multi-year simulations are conducted using random field placement in all agricultural capable areas as well by selectively placing fields in historical or prospective use areas. Regional land cover, elevation, and population information can be used to refine source placement (treated fields), dispersion calculations, and risk assessments. Both current and anticipated/forecasted fumigant scenarios can be simulated to provide risk managers the necessary information to make sound regulatory decisions, and SOFEA has bee...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and test a new {{entrainment}} mapping measurement, the N + 1 difference. BACKGROUNDEntrainment mapping is useful for identifying re-entry circuit sites but is often limited by difficulty in assessing: 1) changes in QRS complexes or P-waves that indicate fusion, and 2) the postpacing interval (PPI) recorded directly from the stimulation site. METHODSIn computer simulations of <b>re-entry</b> circuits, the <b>interval</b> from a stimulus that reset tachycardia to a timing reference during the second beat after the stimulus was compared with the timing of local activation at the site during tachycardia to define an interval designated the N + 1 difference. The N + 1 difference was compared with the PPI-tachycardia cycle length (TCL) difference in simulations and at 65 sites in 10 consecutive patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT) after myocardial infarction and at 45 sites in 10 consecutive patients with atrial flutter. RESULTSIn simulations, the N + 1 difference was equal to the PPI-TCL difference. During mapping of VT and atrial flutter, the N + 1 difference correlated well with the PPI-TCL difference (r ≥ 0. 91, p < 0. 0001), identifying re-entry circuit sites with sensitivity of ≥ 86 % and specificity of ≥ 90 %. Accuracy was similar using either the surface electrocardiogram or an intracardiac electrogram (Eg) as the timing reference. CONCLUSIONSThe N + 1 difference allows entrainment mapping to be used to identify re-entry circuit sites when it is difficult to evaluate Egs at the mapping site or fusion in the surface electrocardiogram...|$|R
40|$|Estimated dermal and {{respiratory}} exposures {{of workers in}} chemigated corn to carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, and permethrin decreased as <b>re-entry</b> <b>interval</b> increased. Dermal exposure was primarily confined to the hands. Based on these data, insecticide impregnable gloves are recommended for workers. Carbaryl and permethrin were not detected in air and chlorpyrifos was below 0. 2 μg/ 1 (ACGIH 1989). Estimated respiratory exposures were below 0. 013 mg/kg/day. By 24 h, all chlorpyrifos estimated margins of safety were greater than 10 -fold, and carbaryl and permethrin exceeded 10 -fold at 2 h indicating the risk of sub-lethal toxicity was low.

However, the danger exists for workers by chronic exposure during the application, especially from pesticide being potential endocrine disruptors (EDS) (fentin acetate, benomyl, endosulfan, methomyl, methidathion). EDS can cause sterility or decreased fertility, impaired development, birth defects of the reproductive tract and metabolic disorders.

40|$|There {{is great}} concern over human {{exposure}} following {{the application of}} pesticides {{for the management of}} turf environments. This concern is expected and germane given the level and frequency of pesticide use, the extent of activities and time spent on turfgrass, and the exposure potential for infants, children, and adults alike. Much effort has been expended in the determination of applicator exposure issues and the means to mitigate problematic exposure situations before and during application of pesticides. However, there are potential exposure concerns for all who enter turfgrass areas following pesticide applications. The present research emphasizes dosimetry (measuring pesticide residues on cotton suits, gloves, and air samplers worn by golfers) and biomonitoring (measuring pesticide metabolites in urine of golfers) in conjunction with environmental monitoring to determine transfer and penetration factors. The direct and simultaneous determination of dosimetry and biomonitoring data provides a novel and complete database on how much pesticide is transferred from the treated turf to the golfer during the play of a round of golf, where transfer takes place, and subsequently how much pesticide is actually absorbed. Dermal exposure was determined to be the dominant exposure pathway to golfers. Exposure estimates based on a 1 h <b>re-entry</b> <b>interval</b> following full-course and full-rate applications of chlorpyrifos, carbaryl, and cyfluthrin are substantially below current US EPA acute Reference Dose (Rfd) values, indicating safe exposures. These already low exposures were successfully mitigated using several management strategies. ...|$|E
40|$|Phase {{distribution}} of airborne chemicals {{is important because}} intake and uptake mechanisms of each phase are different. The phase distribution and concentrations are needed to determine strategies of exposure assessment, hazard control, and worker protection. However, procedures for establishing phase distribution and concentration have not been standardized. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare measurements of an airborne semivolatile pesticide (chlorpyrifos) by phase using two different procedures. Six pesticide applications in two facilities were studied and at each site, samples were collected for three time slots: T 1, the first 1 or 2 hr after the commencement of application; T 2, a 6 -hr period immediately following T 1; and T 3, a 6 -hr period after the required <b>re-entry</b> <b>interval</b> (24 hr for chlorpyrifos). Two phase-separating devices were co-located at the center of each greenhouse: semivolatile aerosol dichotomous sampler (SADS) using flow rates of 1. 8 l x min(- 1) and 0. 2 l x min(- 1), corresponding to a total inlet flow rate of 2. 0 l x min(- 1) with a vapor phase flow fraction of 0. 1; and an electrostatic precipitator (ESP), along with a standard OVS XAD- 2 tube. Chlorpyrifos in vapor and particulate form in a SADS sampling train and that in vapor form in an ESP sampling train were collected in OVS tubes. Chlorpyrifos in particulate form in the ESP setting would have been collected on aluminum substrate. However, no chlorpyrifos in particulate form was recovered from the ESP. Overall (vapor plus particle) concentrations measured by OVS ranged 11. 7 - 186. 6 /m(3) at T 1 and decreased on average 77. 1...|$|E
