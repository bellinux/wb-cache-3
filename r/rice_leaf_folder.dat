40|$|The <b>rice</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>folder,</b> Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenée), {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} rice pests in Asian countries. Rice varieties resistant to the <b>rice</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>folder</b> are generally charac-terized by high silicon content. In this study, silicon amendment, at 0. 16 and 0. 32 g Si/kg soil, enhanced resistance of a susceptible rice variety to the <b>rice</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>folder.</b> Silicon addition to rice plants at both the low and high rates significantly extended larval development and reduced larval survival rate and pupation rate in the <b>rice</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>folder.</b> When applied at the high rate, silicon amendment reduced third-instars ’ weight gain and pupal weight. Altogeth-er, intrinsic rate of increase, finite rate of increase and net reproduction rate of the <b>rice</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>folder</b> population were all reduced at both the low and high silicon addition rates. Although the third instars consumed more in silicon-amended treatments, C:N ratio in rice leaves was significantly increased and food conversion efficiencies were reduced due to increased sili-con concentration in rice leaves.

The main objectives of the studies were to screen out the various genotypes of rice against the <b>rice</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>folder</b> in order not only to identify the primary and secondary metabolites in comparatively resistant genotypes responsible for resistance mechanism but also to find out the impact of abiotic factors, like relative humidity, temperature, rainfall etc. on the population fluctuations of <b>rice</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>folder</b> in addition to checking out of the efficacy of microbial and botanical insecticide against Cnaphalocrocis medinalis alone and in integration with an egg parasitoid Trichogramma chilonis for a successful control of the <b>rice</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>folder.</b> The data on post treatment increase in leaf-infestation and larval-population were recorded 10 days after the application of various treatments.

40|$|Egg {{mortality}} of <b>rice</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>folders</b> Cnaphalocrocis medinalisand Marasmia patnalis was studied in unsprayed irrigated rice fields in Laguna Province, the Philippines. Mortality {{was assessed by}} field exposure of laboratory-laid eggs for two days and by monitoring of field-laid eggs. Egg disappearance, the major mortality factor, was low {{in the first four}} weeks after transplanting and then increased. Egg parasitism by Trichogrammajaponicum was highest {{at the start of the}} crop and decreased to a low level towards crop maturity. Non-hatching of eggs was of minor importance. Over the total duration of the egg stage, the average disappearance of exposed laboratory-laid eggs was 40 %, and of field-laid eggs 46 %. Egg mortality due to parasitism averaged 15 % and 18 %, respectively. The potential impact of egg parasitism is probably partly obscured by the disappearance of parasitized eggs. Mortality rates were highly variable between egg cohorts, but with multiple regression analysis several factors were identified that statistically explained a significant part of this variation. The results suggest that the predatory crickets Metiochevittaticollis and Anaxipha longipennis play a major role in egg disappearance, and that egg parasitism is positively dependent on the overall density of host eggs of Trichogramma in the field...|$|R

In the present study, the physiological and cytological mechanisms underlying the enhanced resistance of plants with Si addition were investigated {{for one of}} the most destructive rice pests in Asian countries, the <b>rice</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>folder,</b> Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenée). Activities of defense-related enzymes, superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, and polyphenol oxidase, and concentrations of malondialdehyde and soluble protein in leaves were measured in rice plants with or without leaf folder infestation and with or without Si amendment at 0. 32 g Si/kg soil. Silicon amendment significantly reduced leaf folder larval survival. Silicon addition alone did not change activities of defense-related enzymes and malondialdehyde concentration in rice leaves. With leaf folder infestation, activities of the defense-related enzymes increased and malondialdehyde concentration decreased in plants amended with Si. Soluble protein content increased with Si addition when the plants were not infested, but was reduced more in the infested plants with Si amendment than in those without Si addition. Regardless of leaf folder infestation, Si amendment significantly increased leaf Si content through increases in the number and width of silica cells. Our results show that Si addition enhances rice resistance to the leaf folder through priming the feeding stress defense system, reduction in soluble protein content and cell silicification of rice leaves...|$|E
40|$|The {{jasmonic acid}} (JA) pathway plays {{a central role}} in plant defense {{responses}} against insects. Some phloem-feeding insects also induce the salicylic acid (SA) pathway, thereby suppressing the plant’s JA response. These phenomena have been well studied in dicotyledonous plants, but little is known about them in monocotyledons. We cloned a chloroplast-localized type 2 13 -lipoxygenase gene of rice, OsHI-LOX, whose transcripts were up-regulated in response to feeding by the rice striped stem borer (SSB) Chilo suppressalis and the rice brown planthopper (BPH) Niaparvata lugens, as well as by mechanical wounding and treatment with JA. Antisense expression of OsHI-LOX (as-lox) reduced SSB- or BPH-induced JA and trypsin protease inhibitor (TrypPI) levels, improved the larval performance of SBB {{as well as that of}} the <b>rice</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>folder</b> (LF) Cnaphalocrocis medinalis, and increased the damage caused by SSB and LF larvae. In contrast, BPH, a phloem-feeding herbivore, showed a preference for settling and ovipositing on WT plants, on which they consumed more and survived better than on as-lox plants. The enhanced resistance of as-lox plants to BPH infestation correlated with higher levels of BPH-induced H 2 O 2 and SA, as well as with increased hypersensitive response-like cell death. These results imply that OsHI-LOX is involved in herbivore-induced JA biosynthesis, and plays contrasting roles in controlling rice resistance to chewing and phloem-feeding herbivores. The observation that suppression of JA activity results in increased resistance to an insect indicates that revision of the generalized plant defense models in monocotyledons is required, and may help develop novel strategies to protect rice against insect pests...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial leaf blight {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{diseases}} in rice and affects yields. Thus, various methods have been applied to protect rice from this disease. Here, we show systemic translocation of the human drug niclosamide (5 -chloro-N-(2 -chloro- 4 -nitrophenyl) - 2 -hydroxybenzamide) in rice and its long-term effect on prevention of <b>rice</b> <b>leaf</b> blight. The development of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae-induced <b>rice</b> <b>leaf</b> blight was effectively inhibited in untreated systemic leaves as in niclosamide-treated leaves, although its effect gradually decreased in a time-dependent manner. Time-course examination after niclosamide treatment showed that the niclosamide level was highest after 3 h in non-treated distal leaves, suggesting fast systemic movement of niclosamide from the treated local site to untreated distal regions. Our data indicate that niclosamide controls <b>rice</b> <b>leaf</b> blight by its rapid systemic movement and that its effect is maintained for a long time...|$|R
