Interview schedule was used to collect data from a sample of 80 respondents. Data were analyzed using frequency, percentage, mean scores and standard deviation. Results indicate that majority (76. 3 %) of the respondents were males, middle aged and married. Major causes of <b>rural-urban</b> youth <b>migration</b> indicated by the respondents include inadequate employment opportunities in rural areas (M= 3. 6), search for better education (M= 3. 5), inadequate social infrastructure such as schools (M= 3. 4), poor medical care services in rural areas (M= 3. 4), looking for money through labour (M= 3. 4), apprenticeship programme (M= 3. 2), etc. Findings of the study also indicate that reduction of agricultural labour force (M= 3. 5), low agricultural productivity (M= 3. 3), high cost of labour (M= 3. 3), reduction on demand for locally grown foods (M= 2. 9), decrease in dependency ratio in the rural areas (M= 2. 7), reduction on number of mouths to feed (M= 2. 7), among others were major effects of <b>rural-urban</b> youth <b>migration</b> among farm families.

25|$|The 1872 census {{revealed}} that 91.3% {{of the population}} of the region constituting present-day India resided in villages. This was a decline from the earlier Mughal era, when 85% of the population resided in villages and 15% in urban centers under Akbar's reign in 1600. Urbanisation generally remained sluggish in British India until the 1920s, due to the lack of industrialisation and absence of adequate transportation. Subsequently, the policy of discriminating protection (where certain important industries were given financial protection by the state), coupled with the Second World War, saw the development and dispersal of industries, encouraging <b>rural–urban</b> <b>migration,</b> and in particular the large port cities of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras grew rapidly.

25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{suggest that}} urbanization creates slums because {{local governments are}} unable to manage urbanization, and migrant workers without an affordable place to live in, dwell in slums. Rapid urbanization drives economic growth and causes people to seek working and investment opportunities in urban areas. However, as evidenced by poor urban infrastructure and insufficient housing, the local governments sometimes are unable to manage this transition. This incapacity {{can be attributed to}} insufficient funds and inexperience to handle and organize problems brought by migration and urbanization. In some cases, local governments ignore the flux of immigrants during the process of urbanization. Such examples can be found in many African countries. In the early 1950s, many African governments believed that slums would finally disappear with economic growth in urban areas. They neglected rapidly spreading slums due to increased <b>rural-urban</b> <b>migration</b> caused by urbanization. Some governments, moreover, mapped the land where slums occupied as undeveloped land.|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} {{economic}} development is characterized by substantial <b>rural-urban</b> <b>migrations</b> and a decreasing share of agriculture in output and employment. The literature highlights two main engines behind this process of structural change: (i) improvements in agricultural technology combined with the effect of Engel's law of demand push resources out of the agricultural sector (the "labor push" hypothesis), and (ii) improvements in industrial technology attract labor into this sector (the "labor pull" hypothesis). We present a simple model that features both channels {{and use it to}} explore their relative importance. We evaluate the U. S. time series since 1800 and a sample of 13 industrialized countries starting in the 19 th century. Our results suggest that, on average, the "labor pull" channel dominates.

2500|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, after the revolution, little had changed. The career path for most artisans still involved apprenticeship under a master, followed by moving into independent production. [...] However, {{over the course of the}} Industrial Revolution, this model rapidly changed, particularly in the major metropolitan areas. For instance, in Boston in 1790, the vast majority of the 1,300 artisans in the city described themselves as [...] "master workman". By 1815, journeymen workers without independent means of production had displaced these [...] "masters" [...] as the majority. By that time journeymen also outnumbered masters in New York City and Philadelphia. This shift occurred as a result of large-scale transatlantic and <b>rural-urban</b> <b>migration.</b> Migration into the coastal cities created a larger population of potential laborers, which in turn allowed controllers of capital to invest in labor-intensive enterprises on a larger scale. Craft workers found that these changes launched them into competition with each other to a degree that they had not experienced previously, which limited their opportunities and created substantial risks of downward mobility that had not existed prior to that time.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{relevant}} {{statistical data}} and literature, this work analyses the demographical development of Slavonia – especially its ethnic structure - {{over a period}} of one century. It revises influences (direct and indirect) that socio-political changes have had on mechanical movements of the population. The foci of attention are the First and Second World Wars, political and territorial changes, agricultural colonization (private and state), economic migrations during the post-war period, de-ruralization and urbanization, <b>rural-urban</b> <b>migrations</b> and the Homeland War. The authors devote a special chapter to the influence of the Homeland War on the development of total population, interrelations between specific ethnic groups and the disruption of population age structure in Slavonia. The analysis has shown that the disrupted age structure – partly as a consequence of previous negative movement trends and major mechanical outflow of the population during the 1990 s, as well as significant war mortality among younger reproduction-capable groups – will have an affect on future demographic ageing of the observed populations. This leads the authors {{to the conclusion that the}} politically induced migrations, and in part assimilation, have had a dominant role in the ethnic homogenization of Slavonia and other parts of Croatia...|$|R

Current flood risk management techniques implemented by the authorities of the Cape Town City Council (CTCC) are not designed to support informal settlements. In fact, owing to a lack of information about the levels of flood risk within the individual settlements, either the CTCC has often been uninvolved or has implemented inappropriate remedies within such settlements. This study sought to investigate a methodology that the CTCC could use to improve flood risk assessment. Using a case study of an informal settlement in Cape Town, this study proposed a methodology of integration of community-based information into a Geographic Information System that can be used by the CTCC for risk assessment. In addition, this research demonstrated the use of a participatory multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) for risk assessment. A questionnaire was used to collect community-based information. The shack outlines of the informal settlement were digitised using CTCC aerial imagery. The questionnaires were captured using spreadsheets and linked to the corresponding shacks in the GIS. Risk weights were subsequently calculated using pairwise comparisons for each household, based on their responses to the questionnaires.

Since non-agricultural labor supply is closely linked to <b>rural–urban</b> labor <b>migration,</b> and except in cases where sufficiently strong incentives intrinsic to the labor market or the prospects for professional growth exist, people of working age tend to become less mobile as they get older. Moreover, since older urban workers tend to face greater risks for structural and frictional unemployment, and the enrollment rate in higher education has continued to rise, an older labor force also means a reduction in labor force participation rates.|$|R

We found that Chinese policy reforms in both rural and urban areas decreased the balkanization of labor markets and opened up employment opportunities for many rural-urban migrants. In rural areas, a set of agricultural market reforms, starting in 1978, increased farm incomes and simultaneously produced a large surplus labor supply. In urban areas, reforms beginning in the 1980 s created an effective demand for rural migrants.
