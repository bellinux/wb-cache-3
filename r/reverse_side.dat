5|$|The Liberty Bell {{appeared}} on a commemorative coin in 1926 to mark the sesquicentennial of American independence. Its first use on a circulating coin was on the <b>reverse</b> <b>side</b> of the Franklin half dollar, struck between 1948 and 1963. It also {{appeared on}} the Bicentennial design of the Eisenhower dollar, superimposed against the moon.|$|E

5|$|When the Eisenhower dollar coin was {{released}} in 1971, the patch design provided the eagle for its <b>reverse</b> <b>side.</b> The design was also used for the smaller Susan B. Anthony dollar unveiled in 1979, {{ten years after the}} Apollo 11 mission.|$|E

5|$|A {{commemorative}} half {{dollar for}} {{the battle was}} produced in 1936. As was typical for the period, mintage for the coin was very low, just 26,928. On January 24, 2011, the America the Beautiful quarters released a 25-cent coin commemorating Gettysburg National Military Park and the Battle of Gettysburg. The <b>reverse</b> <b>side</b> of the coin depicts the monument on Cemetery Ridge to the 72nd Pennsylvania Infantry.|$|E
5|$|In the United States {{green was}} {{connected}} with the dollar bill. Since 1861, the <b>reverse</b> <b>side</b> of the dollar bill has been green. Green was originally chosen because it deterred counterfeiters, who tried to use early camera equipment to duplicate banknotes. Also, since the banknotes were thin, the green on the back did not show through and muddle {{the pictures on the}} front of the banknote. Green continues to be used because the public now associates it with a strong and stable currency.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the Reichsmarschall standard, on a light blue field, {{featured}} a gold German eagle grasping a wreath surmounted by two batons overlaid with a swastika. The <b>reverse</b> <b>side</b> of the flag had the Großkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes ("Grand Cross of the Iron Cross") surrounded by a wreath between four Luftwaffe eagles. The flag was carried by a personal standard-bearer at all public occasions.|$|E

5|$|In Austria, Kepler {{left behind}} such a {{historical}} legacy {{that he was}} one of the motifs of a silver collector's coin: the 10-euro Johannes Kepler silver coin, minted on September 10, 2002. The <b>reverse</b> <b>side</b> of the coin has a portrait of Kepler, who spent some time teaching in Graz and the surrounding areas. Kepler was acquainted with Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg personally, and he probably influenced the construction of Eggenberg Castle (the motif of the obverse of the coin). In front of him on the coin is the model of nested spheres and polyhedra from Mysterium Cosmographicum.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, both Capcom and Marvel {{announced}} that the game would include reversible packaging. The front cover art featured the work of Capcom illustrator Shinkiro, while the <b>reverse</b> <b>side</b> featured the art of Marvel Comics' Mark Brooks. Brook's alternate cover featured all twelve of the game's new characters in his own comic book style. Both pieces of art were printed on a single reversible cover for the entire first run of Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 in North America.|$|E
5|$|Ragnall's {{grant to}} the priory of Paisley is {{preserved}} in two documents: one {{dates to the}} late twelfth- or early thirteenth century, and a later copy is contained in an instrument which dates to 1426. Appended to the latter document is {{a description of a}} seal impressed in white wax, which the fifteenth-century notary alleged to have belonged to Ragnall. On one side, the seal is described to have depicted a ship, filled with men-at-arms. On the <b>reverse</b> <b>side,</b> the seal was said to have depicted a man on horseback, armed with a sword in his hand.|$|E

5|$|The large armlet of pierced gold (opus interrasile) showed {{traces of}} {{hematite}} on the <b>reverse</b> <b>side,</b> which {{probably would have}} been used as a type of jeweller's rouge. This is the earliest known and documented use of this technique on Roman jewellery. Gilt items showed the presence of mercury, indicating the mercury gilding technique. The black inlay on the cast silver tigress shows the niello technique, but with silver sulphide rather than lead sulphide. The settings of stones where garnet and amethyst remain, in the body chain, have vacant places presumed to be where pearls were set, and show elemental sulphur as adhesive or filler.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} badge is a gold Maltese Cross {{of eight}} points, enamelled in white. Each {{point of the}} cross is decorated by a small gold ball; each angle has a small figure of a lion. The centre of the cross bears three crowns on the obverse side, and a rose, a thistle and a shamrock, emanating from a sceptre on the <b>reverse</b> <b>side.</b> Both emblems are surrounded by a red circular ring bearing the motto of the Order, which are in turn flanked by two laurel branches, above a scroll bearing the words Ich dien in gold letters.|$|E
5|$|The obverse {{is similar}} to coins from Merovingian France, {{especially}} from the southern parts, as well as showing influences from Visigothic Spain. The <b>reverse</b> <b>side,</b> however, has no known predecessors in Merovingian or Visigothic coinage. Although by the late 6th century, Merovingian and Visigothic kings were putting their names on their coins, no surviving coins from either kingdom name a bishop. The design of the figure is derived from Byzantine imperial coins, and the cross itself is large and closely resembles an altar cross.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} a host of {{geological}} maps of the U.S. produced in the 20th century. Bailey Willis produced a geological map of the U.S. in 1906. George W. Stose produced a 1:2,500,000 scale map in 1932, and a 1:500,000 scale map together with R.W. Smith in 1939. A.K. Lobeck produced a Geologic map of the United States (with text on the <b>reverse</b> <b>side)</b> in 1941 Those {{are just a few}} that have been produced. The most recent map being produced is the National Map that is a cooperative project.|$|E
5|$|Adud al-Dawla, {{like the}} {{previous}} Buyid rulers, maintained the Abbasids in Baghdad, which gave legitimacy to his dynasty {{in the eyes}} of some Sunni Muslims. However, he showed more interest than his predecessors to the pre-Islamic culture of Iran, and was proud of his Iranian origin. He visited Persepolis alongside Marasfand, the Zoroastrian chief priest (mobad) of Kazerun, who read the pre-Islamic inscriptions in the city for him. Adud al-Dawla later left an inscription in the city, which tells about his awareness of being heir of an ancient pre-Islamic civilization. Adud al-Dawla even claimed descent from the Sasanian king Bahram V Gor, minted coins of him wearing a Sasanian type crown, and carried the traditional Sasanian inscription; Shahanshah, may his glory increase. While the <b>reverse</b> <b>side</b> of the coin said: May Shah Fanna Khusraw live long.|$|E
5|$|Moonrise was {{published}} as a hardcover by HarperCollins on July 25, 2005, in Canada, and August 2, 2005, in the US and UK.
