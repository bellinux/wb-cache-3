25|$|Shi'ahs {{offer this}} as a one rakat salah {{at the end of}} salatul layl (the night prayer), which is an {{optional}} prayer according to some shi'ah scholars, and a wajib (obligatory) prayer according to others. This is to be prayed any time after Isha, up until fajr. The best time to pray it is the last third of the night (the night being divided into three, between maghrib and fajr of that night). It is considered highly meritorious by all shi'ah Muslims, and is said to bring numerous benefits to the believer, mainly gaining proximity to Allah. There are various methods of salatul-layl's performance, including shorter and longer versions, in the longer version the believer must perform 8 nawafil salah, in sets of 2 rakats each, then they must pray a 2 rakats salah called 'salatul shafa'ah' this is to include surah nas after surah fatihah in the first rakat and surah falaq after surah fatihah in the secound rakat, and unusually no qunut (a du'ah recited before going into ruku' of the second rakat of most prayers performed by shi'ahs) It is after this that the believer performs salatul witr, it's long method being - Starting with takbiratul ehram, then surah fatihah, then surah ikhlas, then surah falaq, then surah nas, then the hands are raised to recite qunut, upon which the believer can recite any du'a, however there are many recommended du'as for this purpose. Within qunut, the believer must pray for the forgiveness of 40 believers, then further prayers are read where the believer asks for forgiveness for himself a certain number of times using specified phrases and amounts of times to repeat those phrases. The believer then completes the salah in the usual way, by completing his qunut, reciting takbir whilst <b>rasing</b> his hands, going into ruku' and reciting the usual phrase for that, then returning up right and reciting takbir whilst doing so and upon being upright recites 'sami allahu liman hamida' (verily Allah has heard the one who has praised him) thereupon the believer recites takbir whilst raising his hands and goes into sajda. He recites the proscribed phrase in sajda rises, recites takbir whilst rising and then again whilst returnin to sajdah, then rises with takbir again and recites tashahud and salam, thus ending this prayer. It is then optional to recite certain other du'as and dhikr (remembrance of Allah through certain phrases and some of his names being repeated) It is then recommended to perform and sajdah ash-shukr (prostration of thanks) and to then recite ayatul kursi (verse of the throne) and then perform another sajdah ash-shukr.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Current {{arthritis}} self-efficacy scales {{have attracted}} some criticism. Therefore, {{the aim of}} this study was to develop and validate a measure of self-efficacy for use in British rheumatoid arthritis patients [Rheumatoid Arthritis Self-efficacy (<b>RASE)</b> scale]. Methods: Phase I: item generation of self-management strategies by rheumatology professionals and patients to create a pilot <b>RASE.</b> Phase II: examination of the internal structure (n= 88) using correlation coefficients and principal component analysis (PCA) to create the final <b>RASE.</b> Phase III: reliability in 23 patients. Phase IV: comprehension, construct validity and sensitivity to change in 48 rheumatoid arthritis patients undergoing a self-management programme, using correlation coefficients, PCA and inter-item correlation. Results: Phase I: of 166 self-management items generated, 100 commonly cited items were selected for the pilot <b>RASE.</b> Phase II: using a correlation matrix and PCA, a 28 -item <b>RASE</b> was created. Phase III: good 4 -week reliability was seen (r= 0. 889, P< 0. 001). Phase IV: the final <b>RASE</b> was shown to be independent of mood, disease status and disability and weakly associated with other self-efficacy scales (r= 0. 313, P< 0. 05). The <b>RASE</b> was sensitive to change following an education programme (+ 5. 167, P< 0. 025), and was associated with behaviour initiation (r= 0. 35, P< 0. 01). Conclusions: Careful construction means that the <b>RASE</b> examines beliefs in potential ability to perform tasks, rather than actual ability, performance or outcome expectancy. It shows good face validity and reliability, plus reasonable construct validity and sensitivity. Further studies are needed to support the validation of this new scale...|$|R

2500|$|For the 1953 racing season, Amm debuted the {{controversial}} Norton Kneeler 350cc motorcycle at the 1953 North West 200 Race.

Despite testing the Norton Kneeler for practice for the 1953 Isle of Man TT Races, Amm reverted to the non-steamlined Norton motorcycles due to handling problems with cross-winds on the Mountain Section of the course and also opposition by the TT Race Scrutineers. It proved a good choice as Amm won the 1953 Junior TT Race at an average race speed of 90.52mph from Ken Kavanagh in 2nd place and Fergus Anderson in 3rd place. [...] Another win in the 1953 Senior TT Race for Amm at an average race speed of 93.85mph completed a prestigious Junior/Senior TT double win for the works Norton team. Following Amm during the 1953 Senior TT Race, Geoff Duke commented on Amm's distinctive riding style;- [...] "After I had caught and passed Ray Amm on the Norton, he passed me at Ballugh when I missed a gearchange!

However, Amm returned to the abortive Norton Kneeler project in November 1953 to set a number of world speed records at Montlhéry, France <b>rasing</b> the hour speed endurance record to a distance of 133.70miles. Also at Montlhéry in November 1953, Amm shared a streamlined Norton Sidecar outfit with Eric Oliver to set further speed records.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—When {{developers}} add {{features and}} fix bugs, they often make systematic edits—similar edits to multiple locations. Systematic edits {{may indicate that}} developers should instead refactor to eliminate redundancy. This paper explores this ques-tion by designing and implementing a fully automated refactoring tool called <b>RASE,</b> which performs clone removal. <b>RASE</b> (1) extracts common code guided by a systematic edit; (2) creates new types and methods as needed; (3) parameterizes differences in types, methods, variables, and expressions; and (4) inserts return objects and exit labels based on control and data flow. To our knowledge, this functionality makes <b>RASE</b> the most advanced refactoring tool for automated clone removal. We evaluate <b>RASE</b> with real-world systematic edits and com-pare to method based clone removal. <b>RASE</b> successfully performs clone removal in 30 of 56 method pairs (n= 2) and 20 of 30 method groups (n≥ 3) with systematic edits. We find that scoping refactoring based on systematic edits (58 %), rather than the entire method (33 %), increases the applicability of automated clone removal. Automated refactoring is not feasible in the other 42 % cases, which indicates that automated refactoring does not obviate the need for systematic editing. I...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Patient {{education}} in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) aims to improve health outcomes by prompting people to adopt self-management behaviours. One precursor for initiating behaviour change is self-efficacy (SE), {{a belief that}} you can do a task. This study tested the sensitivity to change of a new scale to measure SE for self-management in people with RA, the Rheumatoid Arthritis Self-Efficacy scale (<b>RASE).</b> Exploratory analysis examined potential predictors of change in SE. Methods: People with RA at 11 rheumatology centres, who had accepted an education programme as part of clinical care, completed questionnaires at baseline, and two and eight weeks after their programme end. Programmes were not standardized, as this was a pragmatic study in clinical practice. Results: A total of 128 patients participated. After controlling for baseline scores, the <b>RASE</b> showed small but significant improvements in SE from baseline (<b>RASE</b> 107. 57, CI 105. 42 - 109. 72) to two weeks after programme end (<b>RASE</b> 110. 80, CI 108. 60 - 112. 99), and eight weeks (<b>RASE</b> 110. 62, CI 108. 40 - 112. 85, p < 0. 001). Standardized response means, calculated both by absolute and percentage change, were 0. 339 and 0. 371 at two weeks after programme end, and 0. 321 and 0. 352 at eight weeks. Changes in the <b>RASE</b> were associated with behaviour initiation at two and eight weeks (r = 0. 419, r = 0. 342, p < 0. 001). No substantial predictors of change in SE could be identified. Conclusions: The <b>RASE</b> is sensitive to change in a cohort of people with RA in the UK receiving education programmes as routine clinical care. Exploratory analysis did not identify clinical or psychological factors that predict change in SE, suggesting that programmes should not be restricted to particular patients...|$|R
