5000|$|The Super Duty was {{introduced}} in 1958, {{the same year as}} the FE and MEL series V8 engines, as a replacement for the Lincoln Y-block in truck applications. The Super Duty was available in displacements of 401, 477 and 534 cubic inches (6.6L, 7.8L and 8.8L). These engines were large, heavy, high torque engines and operated at a relatively low RPM. They were never designed as automobile engines and were commonly found in large, industrial use vehicles including dump trucks, garbage trucks, concrete mixing trucks, large buses and other medium and heavy duty trucks of the time. The Super Duty engine was built in Ford's Cleveland engine plant number 2. They had a unique intake system where the intake dumped into the head and all four cylinders pulled the mixture out of a log type port in the head. They could spit when cold and blow the choke plate out into the air cleaner because of the large port configuration. In later engines this was corrected; they had a spider type intake more modern style. The exhaust valves were sodium filled that when hot it liquefied and carried heat away from the valve head and took it to the valve spring that dispensed heat into the oil coming off the rocker arm which is the reason for a water to oil cooler. The piston assembly weighed three times more than other gas engine manufactures. The block was unique in that it was a 90 degree v 8 but the top deck was 60 degrees. The head was flat on the combustion chamber side so by doing this they achieved a wedge combustion chamber. With this design it left a big hole so they put a large pop top piston to try to displace some volume. They used a deep skirted block for strength. They governed these at about 3400 rpm due to their great rotating mass. When ford built the 385 series engine and started to change over a 460 or 429 weighed about half of the 477.

25|$|To {{adapt the}} BMW M52 engine to the Defender chassis, the {{engineers}} {{were able to}} utilize some of the parts from the recently developed BMW M51 diesel powered Range Rover 2.5 DSE. They used the clutch housing, clutch, flywheel, and slave cylinder from that vehicle to connect the engine to the R380 gearbox, {{but they had to}} produce a new clutch housing adaptor (bell housing) for the petrol M52 engine in the Defender. The unique clutch housing adaptor was necessary because the petrol M52 engine is tilted 10 degrees compared to the diesel M51 engine and it needed to be longer to match the input shaft of the R380 gearbox borrowed from the 300Tdi Defender. Due to the large diameter gearbox input shaft, the standard BMW pilot bearing could not be fitted, so a unique pilot bushing made of Oilite bronze was developed. It had an inside diameter of 7/8 inch with an outside diameter of 32mm. A mixture of non-metric and metric specifications are common on Land Rovers. Other unique parts that were developed for the 2.8i were the air intake ducts {{both before and after the}} Donaldson FPG RadialSeal™ air cleaner, engine mounts, <b>radiator</b> cowl, cooling <b>hoses,</b> fuel lines, clutch lines, air conditioning system, engine wiring, tachometer gauge, exhaust system, and a specially tuned Siemens MS41.0 DME with a Lucas 10AS alarm in place of the Drive Away Protection system (EWS) used on BMWs. There were also major changes for the 1999 model year, which included updated instrumentation, different chassis and engine wiring, an updated cooling system with aluminum radiator, and an updated fuel system with new fuel tank. The 1.667:1 gear ratio LT230 transfer box gave the vehicle a “rev happy” nature which delighted many off-road enthusiasts and made the vehicle particularly well suited for traversing a wide range of grueling terrain such as sand dunes. The high gear ratio also helped the 2.8i sprint from 0–100km/h in 9.3 seconds, making it the fastest production Defender ever made.|$|R

50|$|On the Escort's first outing at World Championship level, the 1993 Monte Carlo Rally, Delecour {{took the}} lead with Biasion second. The pair led the event until the final night, when a late charge by Didier Auriol, driving a Toyota Celica, saw him win, with the Fords second and third. Nevertheless, the new car had {{demonstrated}} its potential, which was underlined the following month when Malcolm Wilson, driving a car prepared by his own team, briefly led the Swedish Rally before retiring after an accident. The works team returned for the Portuguese Rally: Delecour led almost from the start and won the event with Biasion second, establishing both car and driver as serious contenders for that year's World Championship. Delecour won again in Corsica, and Biasion in Greece - his first win for three years - putting them first and second in the drivers' championship, and Ford in the joint lead in the manufacturers' title. However, {{during the second half}} of the season Toyota driver Juha Kankkunen won in Argentina, Finland and Australia, whilst with the exception of Delecour's second place (behind Colin McRae) in New Zealand the Fords' results were relatively poor, giving Toyota the manufacturers' title. Both works Escorts then retired on the San Remo Rally, Delecour after an accident and Biasion with engine failure after a <b>radiator</b> <b>hose</b> split, but the event was won by Italian Franco Cunico, in a privately entered Escort Cosworth. It was the first time in several years that a privateer had won at this level, and in doing so he outpaced the works Lancia Delta Integrale of reigning World Champion Carlos Sainz, demonstrating the superiority of the Escort over the previously dominant Lancia.

40|$|Cooling {{system in}} the engine {{functions}} as the protector of the machine by absorbing the heat. Heat engine is produced by fuel in the cylinder. The heat is deliberately created to generate energy, but it will cause excessive heat if it is left unchecked (over heating effect).

40|$|The current thesis {{consists}} of a chapter as literature review in which different scientific sources {{and the results of}} investigation of various researchers are reviewed, followed by 5 chapters (2 to 6) and an appendix covering the results of the experimental work performed. The results can be divided in 3 main sections: Section 1 : Short-fibre rubber composites. In the first section rubber composites reinforced with short aramid fibres are focused upon; the reinforcement mechanisms and the mechanical and viscoelastic properties of the composites are explored. • In the second chapter, short fibre reinforced NR and EPDM rubbers are the subjects of investigation. In the different short fibre-rubber systems examined, clear chemical adhesion only happened in the case of peroxide-cured EPDM with RFL-treated fibres. This phenomenon was most clearly reflected in the tensile curves for this system, showing a large reinforcement factor particularly at tensile elongations below 100 %. Next to potential chemical bonding, mechanical interaction between fibres and rubber matrix plays an important role. Surface phenomena on the fibres, as bending/buckling, dog-bone shaped fibre ends and surface roughness due to the RFL-coating cause mechanical interlocking. So, {{even in the absence of}} chemical adhesion, adding short aramid fibres improves the mechanical properties of rubber compounds because of the mechanical interaction. • Chapter three describes the results of the investigation of the composite morphology and interaction of two different types of short aramid fibres in an EPDM <b>radiator</b> <b>hose</b> compound and its corresponding model system. PPTA fibres with RFL-dip could not be dispersed completely to filament level due to the gluing effect of the dip. Irrespective of the mixing time, PP/ODPTA fibres could better withstand the applied shear stresses during mixing and maintain a high level of fibre length, which resulted in better mechanical properties in composites reinforced with these fibres compared to those reinforced with PPTA fibres. On the other side, the RFL-dip acted as protective layer and prevented the fibres from excessive breaking, which was especially the case for PPTA. It was shown that for RFL-coated fibres, chemical bonding only happens between a part of RFL-treated filaments and EPDM rubber. Still the composites containing these fibres showed better mechanical properties compared to those reinforced with standard finish. The reason for this superiority is not only the partial chemical bonds, but two more factors are involved: better mechanical interlocking of the RFL-treated fibres and the surrounding matrix (due to the roughness of the coating), and the higher final length of these fibres after mixing. • Due to the importance of viscoelastic properties in performance of a lot of rubber parts, especially tires, the dynamic properties of the short fibre-reinforced compounds are the subject of the fourth chapter. It was shown that mechanical and chemical interactions between short fibres and a rubber matrix, which are the reasons for an increase in storage modulus, can affect loss properties in different ways, depending on the type of matrix, temperature, dynamic strain and the possible application of a static pre-strain. In this respect two main influencing factors needed to be considered: 1) Reinforcement as a result of interaction between fibres and rubber which results in an increase in storage modulus of the composite; 2) If there is no perfect interphase and fibres and rubbers are not fully bonded, sliding of the rubber matrix along the fibre surface causes additional losses due to friction. There is no general rule that adding fibre increases or decreases the loss angle and it totally depends on the balance of these two factors at different strain, frequency and temperature regimes. The importance of mechanical interaction in short fibre reinforcement was emphasized again to be an important parameter also in determining the viscoelastic properties of the composites. Section 2 : RFL-rubber interaction. This section {{consists of}} two chapters dedicated to the subject of the adhesion mechanism between rubbers and the RFL-layer itself. The effect of RFL-aging, the role of rubber curing systems and inter-diffusion of the latex part of RFL and elastomer are focused upon. • In chapter five the effect of physical interaction between fibres and rubbers was shown to be minor. Un-aged RFL is able to generate good adhesion to both sulphur and peroxide cured rubbers due to the generation of chemical bonds. As a result of the aging of RFL, ozone is able to decrease the number of double bonds of the latex part of the RFL, which negatively affects the RFL-rubber adhesion in sulphur-cured systems, while it has almost no effect in peroxide-cured systems. It was also discussed that, unlike in sulphur vulcanization in which bonding happens only between the latex in the RFL and rubber, peroxide is able to generate bonds also between elastomer and the resin structure of the RFL-coating. It was also shown that mechanical interlocking increases the total interaction between (roughened) fibres and rubbers when the adhesion tests are done in the shear mode, while this effect is not reflected in peeling tests. • In the sixth chapter the adhesion of aramid fibres after being coated with RFL, in compounds based on NR and in NR blended with a small amount of SBR is investigated. It was shown that though having very similar tensile properties, the latter compound has much better adhesion to RFL which is also less sensitive to RFL aging, compared to the pure NR compound. It is argued that an interphase region is formed between RFL and the elastomer, which is stronger for the compound containing SBR due to its enhanced compatibility with the latex part of the RFL. Even if the RFL-treated fibres are aged, better compatibility causes better mutual diffusion between the latex of the RFL and the elastomer chains and increases the chance of co-vulcanization between rubber and intact latex chains in greater depth from the initial contact zone. This can partly compensate the negative effect of RFL aging. Section 3 : Enhancement of rubber-fibre interaction. The last section based on the results of the two previous sections, deals with two different approaches for enhancement of the interaction between the aramid fibres and rubber matrices. • In the appendix, two different methods were employed to enhance the interaction between fibres and rubbers based on the two mentioned mechanisms. Increasing the roughness of the surface of aramid fibres with a laser, and functionalizing the surface of the fibres with chloroformates and isocyanates. Laser irradiation is performed on uncoated fibres (standard fibres) and the SEM pictures showed that roughening was successfully achieved. For chemical modification, fibres with an epoxy sub-coating only, were chosen because of the existence of hydroxyl/amine groups on the surface which provide reactive sites for the reaction with the chemicals mentioned. The presence of bound reactants on the fibre surface was demonstrated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, the tensile curves showed enhanced properties of the composites reinforced with these modified fibres...|$|E
