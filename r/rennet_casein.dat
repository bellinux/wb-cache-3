40|$|Process cheese {{models were}} {{prepared}} by blending acid or <b>rennet</b> <b>casein,</b> milk fat, sodium chloride, 2. 5 % emulsifying salt {{and water and}} heating to 80 C. Acid casein cheese models were subjected to sodium hydroxide conditioning at 65 C in the cooker. Model process cheeses were acidified with lactic acid and treated by addition of undenatured and heat-denatured whey protein, four different emulsifying salts and sodium oxalate. Meltability and toughness of the model cheese increased to a maximum with increased sodium hydroxide conditioning of acid casein to pH 7. 20. These same properties decreased with addition of undenatured and heat-denatured whey protein to both casein cheese models. Loss of emulsion occurred during the meltability test of <b>rennet</b> <b>casein</b> cheese models with 3. 0 and 4. 5 % added whey protein. Emulsifying salts affected the models differently. Disodium phosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate in <b>rennet</b> <b>casein</b> models eliminated the melting property. These same salts in acid casein models produced excellent meltability. Trisodium citrate produced cheeses with good meltability in both acid and <b>rennet</b> <b>casein</b> cheese models. Acid casein cheese models prepared with sodium aluminum phosphate had fair meltability and were very tender (no rupture upon compression). Chelation of calcium by sodium oxalate in <b>rennet</b> <b>casein</b> cheese emulsified with disodium phosphate or tetrasodium pyrophosphate improved meltability with a corresponding increase in toughness. Scanning electron micrographs of model process cheeses indicated a direct relationship between extent of emulsification and poor meltability of rennet and pH conditioned acid casein model cheeses. Acid casein model cheeses prepared with different emulsifying salts did not exhibit this same relationship. Addition of whey protein concentrate to rennet case~n model cheese produced fibrous structures around the fat globules. No structural abnormalities were noted in the acid casein cheeses prepared with whey protein concentrate...|$|E
40|$|Four {{batches of}} filled type {{processed}} and two batches of analogous fresh kashar cheeses were produced. For the filled type, <b>rennet</b> <b>casein,</b> sodium caseinate, calcium caseinate and soy protein isolate {{were added to}} the sliced elastic cheese curd so that the percentage of each was 5 % in total molten mass (CRC, CSC, CCC, CSOY, respectively). The first batch of imitation cheeses was prepared using <b>rennet</b> <b>casein,</b> soy protein isolate, hydrogenated cottonseed oil, NaCl, carrageenan, water, emulsifier (R 1) and the other was prepared with sodium caseinate, modified starch, hydrogenated cottonseed oil, water and emulsifier (R 2). Natural fresh kashar obtained from a local dairy plant was used as a control. The cheese samples were analysed for physicochemical, textural and melting characteristics. All the imitation groups had lower dry matter (P< 0. 01) and protein (P< 0. 01), but higher fat in dry matter (P< 0. 01) content than the control. The <b>rennet</b> <b>casein</b> filled group and the R 2 batch gave the best results among the imitation cheese groups with respect to textural and melting properties...|$|E
40|$|High {{temperatures}} Induce certain {{changes in}} milk constituents, but {{the degree of}} these changes depends on both the temperature and time of heat treatment. The most pronounced changes take place in milk proteins. The forewarming of milk causes an increase in acidity, the precipitation of soluble Ca-phosphate, whey protein denaturation and coagulation, {{as well as the}} interaction with casein micelles, the Maillard browning reaction, the dephosphorylation of casein, the hydrolysis of casein micelles, changes in whey proteins, an extension of the rennet coagulation time and an exchange of the rheological properties of the acid and <b>rennet</b> <b>casein</b> gels, changes in the zeta-potential and casein micelle hydration, the interaction between the milk proteins and proteins of milk fat globule membrane...|$|E
40|$|The water holding {{capacity}} of casein gels was investigated by measuring the swelling and de-swelling {{under a variety of}} conditions of temperature and salt concentration. Transglutaminase cross-linked sodium caseinate (15 % w/w) gels will swell in good solvents or shrink in poor solvents until an equilibrium casein volume fraction is reached, and this is determined by the cross-link density. The results are interpreted using extended Flory-Rehner theory for weak polyelectrolytes. NaCl and CaCl 2 solutions tend to shrink the gels through the decreased Donnan pressure. In contrast, high volume fraction <b>renneted</b> <b>casein</b> (48 % w/w) gels tend to swell in NaCl and CaCl 2. These results are consistent with theory since the equilibrium volume fractions appear to be at an intermediate value (estimated about 20 %). Experiments on casein micelles, which can be considered nano-gels, show the same behavior and trends. Physically cross-linked gels such as a highly concentrated <b>renneted</b> <b>casein</b> gel and casein micelles show the same (de-) swelling behavior. Cross-linked caseinate gels (15 % w/w) have a lesser tendency to swell due to the lower casein volume fraction. Physically cross-linked gels will eventually completely dissolve in a good solvent. The results presented give a clear picture of the parameters that determine the equilibrium water content of a food polymer gel...|$|R
40|$|Results {{are given}} on the milk {{clotting}} properties and casein hydrolytic behaviour of partially purified extracts of four new cysteine plant endopeptidases: balansain, hieronymain, asclepain f, and philibertain g. Milk coagulation behaviour was different for the assayed proteases: balansain and hieronymain showed a similar performance, whereas asclepain f exhibited the lowest clotting activity; philibertain g exhibited the highest one when was previously incubated with cysteine. According {{to the relative}} ratio of clotting activity to proteolytic activity, balansain, philibertain g and hieronymain appear as possible vegetable <b>rennets.</b> <b>Casein</b> hydrolysates were produced with each enzyme and the hydrolysis pattern was analysed by tricine SDS-PAGE. The α S 2 - and α S 1 -casein fractions, associated with cheese texture, showed different degradation patterns: higher degradation kinetics was obtained for philibertain g, followed by balansain and hieronymain, whereas asclepain f showed the lowest activity. The β-casein fraction, related to bitterness, showed similar initial degradation kinetics for balansain and asclepain f; degradation was faster {{in the case of}} philibertain g and slower for hieronymain. In the case of the κ-casein fraction, involved in milk clotting, the most remarkable behaviour was that of hieronymain, as this casein fraction was quickly degraded by the protease. ...|$|R
40|$|To be able {{to improve}} the quality of dairy {{products}} and dairy processes, knowledge of casein molecules, casein micelles and casein aggregates is important. The rheological properties of casein products, casein gels and adsorbed layers of casein, have been widely investigated. However, the micellar properties of casein could, until recently, only be studied by ensemble methods such as dynamic light scattering and microscopic techniques, using dried or frozen samples. Nano-techniques, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) have now made it possible to make complementary nanorheological measurements in a liquid environment. In this thesis, the observed nanorheological properties of single casein micelles, adsorbed thin casein layers and rennet-induced casein-retentate gels, are presented and discussed. The ultimate objective of these studies was to investigate the relationship between the local and the macroscopic rheological properties of cheese. The <b>renneted</b> <b>casein</b> gels were produced from casein retentate from ultrafiltration (UF), as another objective of the work was to increase our knowledge on cheese production from concentrated milk. Natural rennet-induced cheese is essentially a particulate calcium phosphate-para-casein matrix, composed of interconnected and overlapping strands of partially fused para-casein aggregates, which are in turn made up of para-casein micelles. To increase our knowledge on the nanorheological behaviour of the building blocks of the casein matrix, the first step was to investigate single adsorbed casein micelles. In the AFM measurements, the nanorheological properties of adsorbed casein micelles could not be explained by any model describing an elastic material (Paper I). Preliminary results led to investigations of the possibility that surface tension phenomena could explain the rheological behaviour. Results from computer modelling confirmed that essential features of such model corresponded to the relation between force and indentation from AFM measurements. A surface tension of 10 mNm- 1 was calculated for a casein micelle attached to a hydrophobic graphite surfaces in a Ca-imidazole buffer environment (Paper III) ...|$|R
40|$|Fundamental {{aspects of}} casein drying have been {{investigated}} to provide relevant information for design, operation and control of industrial casein driers. Casein desorption isotherms were sigmoid in shape and of type II according to the BET classification. A modified Henderson equation could describe the equilibrium moisture content (EMC) of casein {{as a function of}} water activity (equilibrium relative humidity) and temperature. Under similar drying conditions, the EMC of casein decreased in the order mineral acid > rennet > lactic. Studies on mineral acid casein indicated that the EMC was not affected by wet processing conditions but more severe drying conditions caused a significant decrease. Drying mechanisms were studied in a laboratory tunnel drier and a fluidized bed drier. The batch drying curve in the tunnel drier consisted of a short constant rate period (CRP) and two linear falling rate periods (FRP). The critical moisture content was about 1. 5 kg water/kg dry solids. In contrast the batch drying curve in the fluidized bed drier had a long constant rate period down to a critical moisture content of around 0. 5 kg water/kg dry solids, followed by a single linear falling rate period. The effects of drying conditions and casein manufacturing conditions were studied in the fluidized bed drier. The CRP drying rate was directly proportional to the air temperature driving force. The FRP drying rate also increased with an increase in air temperature. An increase in air velocity caused an increase in the CRP drying rate but did not affect the drying rate in the FRP. A rise in casein precipitation pH from 4. 3 to 4. 8 caused a significant reduction in the CRP drying rate but had only a small effect on the FRP drying rate. The precipitation and hot wash temperatures of casein curd had no significant effect on the drying rates. Curd plasticization did not affect the drying rate in the CRP but increased the FRP drying rate. In the CRP, larger particles (> 2. 00 mm) tended to dry more slowly than smaller particles because of reduced fluidization efficiency, but particle sizes ranging from 0. 50 to 3. 35 mm did not appear to affect drying rates in the FRP. In general the CRP was affected by factors which altered the gas phase heat and mass transfer whereas the FRP tended to be influenced by factors affecting the solid phase heat and mass transfer. Measurements in a commercial plant indicated that bigger casein particles leaving the drier had significantly higher moisture contents than the smaller particles. Moisture equilibration between the big and small particles was reached in about 3 hours. Studies on drying of single casein particles indicated that lactic casein particles had higher air contents than <b>rennet</b> <b>casein</b> and mineral acid casein particles when drying from a mean initial MC of 1. 2 kg water/kg dry solids to a final MC of 0. 02 kg water/kg dry solids. This caused particle shrinkage of about 40 % for all three types of casein which was brought about by both evaporation of moisture and contraction of the casein matrix. Below about 0. 40 kg water/kg solids, the casein matrix no longer contracted significantly and the voids left by the evaporating moisture became air pores. A pulsed NMR technique was used to obtain the self diffusion coefficient (D) and transverse relaxation time (T 2) of water in mineral acid, lactic and <b>rennet</b> <b>casein</b> particles, as well as the moisture distribution images within mineral acid casein particles. The self diffusion coefficient and transverse relaxation time for all casein types decreased with decreasing moisture content. But at the same moisture content the T 2 values for acid caseins were much higher than for <b>rennet</b> <b>casein.</b> This may be attributed to the extra mineral content of <b>rennet</b> <b>casein.</b> The maximum self diffusion coefficient of water within a casein particle was about 25 % that of pure water. The T 2 of pure water was about 200 times that for acid caseins and 750 times for <b>rennet</b> <b>casein.</b> Moisture equilibration between particles took about 3 hours to reach an equilibrium D value which compares well with the value above. The proton density image within a wet casein particle showed regions of high moisture content and some regions of very low moisture content which may be air gaps. The effects of temperature and time on casein colour and casein solubility in alkali were studied for a range of moisture contents. In general low moisture samples were more soluble than high moisture samples. However for holding temperatures up to 100 °C and holding time up to 2 hours, the maximum insolubility of casein occurred at a moisture concent of around 0. 43 kg water/kg dry solids. Casein colour was not affected by holding temperatures of up to 100 °C at holding times of up to one hour. However a 2 hour holding time at 100 °C caused severe discoloration of casein. The implications of these results for commercial casein drying are discussed and a new design concept for casein dry processing is proposed...|$|E
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{was developed to}} quantitatively analyze the rheological data of <b>rennet</b> <b>casein</b> gels cooled at different rates, and the kinetic parameters were estimated and correlated with the microstructure development of the protein network. The kinetic model identified structure development to be first order, displaying multiple steps during cooling. By distinguishing the data into two regions with respect to gelation, the activation energies for these two regimes were estimated for four protein concentrations. At slower cooling rates and higher concentrations prior to gelation, the activation energies were higher, corresponding with {{a greater number of}} particle collisions prior to floc formation. This trend was reversed after gelation: a lower activation energy was observed for slower cooling rates and higher concentrations. This observation resulted from a higher order of flocs at a slower cooling rate and more flocs at a higher concentration, simplifying floc cross-linking. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{large-scale}} isolation of beta-casein from renneted skim milk was developed. The Curd from renneted skim milk was dispersed in hot (>= 70 degrees C) water to inactivate residual chymosin. The heated curd was subsequently recovered by centrifugation. resuspended {{in water and}} incubated at 5 degrees C, during which P-casein dissociated from the curd, the suspension was centrifuged and the aqueous phase lyophilised. The isolated protein consisted mainly of beta-cascin, containing a minor amount of gamma-caseins and traces of other caseins. Unless chymosin was fully inactivated by heating, some beta-casein was hydrolysed at the Leu(192) -Tyr(193) bond. The yield of beta-casein increased with incubation time, up to similar to 20 % of the beta-cascin present in the milk after 24 h at 5 degrees C. Reducing milk pH to 5. 5 or 6. 0, prior to renneting, caused {{a high level of}} contamination with alpha(s) -cascins. This isolation procedure can be easily scaled-up to an industrial process and the beta-casein-depleted curd may be used for the manufacture of <b>rennet</b> <b>casein</b> or processed cheese.

40|$|An "artificial milk" system, {{prepared}} under controlled conditions, was developed. This {{was used}} {{for the study of the}} initial phase of <b>rennet</b> action on <b>casein</b> which results in gel formation. It was also used for a study of factors contributing to syneresis of rennet-casein gels. "Artificial milks" containing calcium alone (60 - 125 mg% added calcium) added as Ca Cl 2 2 H 2 O were shown to contain micelles very similar in gross structure and physical organisation to those in normal skim milk. It was demonstrated by electron microscopy that the presence of phosphate ion in the "artificial milks", whether as Na 2 HPO 4 or as H 3 PO 4, sharply reduced the size of casein micelles which were then quite unlike those in skim milk. Rennet action at 0 °C on both sodium caseinate and calcium caseinate "milks" was found to significantly reduce the viscosity and hydration constant 'K' of the caseinate systems. An ultracentrifugal technique using haemoglobin as an indicator, showed that <b>rennet</b> action on <b>casein</b> micelles in calcium caseinate "milks" released, at or about gel point, a quantity of "immobilised" water which amounted to about 70 % of the weight of the "wet" protein. Electron Micrographs of calcium-caseinate "milks", calcium caseinate - calcium phosphate "milks" and skim milk indicated that gel formation was essentially a micelle-surface phenomenon. No indication was found for the distortion of the micelles due to rennet action, nor did rennet action appear to reduce the size of the micelles. Whole casein was found to contain both cystine and cysteine. However, sulphydryl - disulphide or disulphide exchange reactions did not appear to play a significant role in gel formation or in the syneresis of rennet-casein systems. The studies indicated that the presence of para-kappa casein in its entirety, probably on the micelle surface, was necessary for the development of a 3 -dimensional gel network. Modification of para-kappa casein through scission of the disulphide bond was found to give a precipitate rather than a gel network after rennet action. Calcium was shown to be important for both gel formation and syneresis. In its absence, neither phenomena occurred in rennet-casein systems. Despite this observed fact, evidence has been presented to show that syneresis was not a continuation of the gelation phenomena. Factors which greatly affected syneresis were found not to affect gel formation. Both <b>rennet</b> modification of <b>casein</b> and the presence of calcium was found to be necessary for syneresis to occur. In the absence of either, no syneresis was observed even when the pH was lowered below the isoelectric point. The level of calcium in the "milks" was found to greatly influence both the rate and the extent of syneresis. A sharp drop in syneresis was observed in rennet-casein systems containing between 125 mg% and 175 mg% added calcium. It was postulated that the addition of such a level of calcium neutralised by interaction, the available negative charges on the caseinate and that this caused the gel network to acquire a net positive charge, thus giving rise to electrostatic forces promoting swelling and opposing syneresis. Dinitrophenylation studies and studies on heated "artificial milk" systems containing reducing sugars showed that β casein played a major role in the interactions causing syneresis. αs and kappa casein did not appear to play a significant role in this phenomenon. The studies emphasised the important and possibly direct role played by the free amino groups of β-casein, probably the epsilon amino groups of lysine, in syneresis. The attractive forces causing shrinkage of the system after gel formation has occurred initially appear to be primarily electrostatic in character. It appears possible that free amino groups are exposed by rennet action on kappa casein and these are involved with calcium in the gelation phenomenon. It is postulated that both gelation and subsequently syneresis result from the formation of co-ordinate covalent linkages between calcium and the separately involved free amino groups of the kappa casein for gelation and β casein for syneresis...|$|R
40|$|Rapid, {{cost-effective}} {{monitoring of}} milk technological traits {{is a significant}} challenge for dairy industries specialized in cheese manufacturing. The objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate the ability of mid-infrared spectroscopy to predict rennet coagulation time, curd-firming time, curd firmness at 30 and 60  min after rennet addition, heat coagulation time, casein micelle size, and pH in cow milk samples, and to quantify associations between these milk technological traits and conventional milk quality traits. Samples (n =  713) were collected from 605 cows from multiple herds; the samples represented multiple breeds, stages of lactation, parities, and milking times. Reference analyses were undertaken in accordance with standardized methods, and mid-infrared spectra in the range of 900 to 5, 000  cm− 1 were available for all samples. Prediction models were developed using partial least squares regression, and prediction accuracy was based on both cross and external validation. The proportion of variance explained by the prediction models in external validation was greatest for pH (71 %), followed by rennet coagulation time (55 %) and milk heat coagulation time (46 %). Models to predict curd firmness 60  min from <b>rennet</b> addition and <b>casein</b> micelle size, however, were poor, explaining only 25 and 13 %, respectively, of the total variance in each trait within external validation. On average, all prediction models tended to be unbiased. The linear regression coefficient of the reference value on the predicted value varied from 0. 17 (casein micelle size regression model) to 0. 83 (pH regression model) but all differed from 1. The ratio performance deviation of 1. 07 (casein micelle size prediction model) to 1. 79 (pH prediction model) for all prediction models in the external validation was < 2, suggesting that none of the prediction models could be used for analytical purposes. With the exception of casein micelle size and curd firmness at 60  min after rennet addition, the developed prediction models may be useful as a screening method, because the concordance correlation coefficient ranged from 0. 63 (heat coagulation time prediction model) to 0. 84 (pH prediction model) in the external validation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis thesis {{evaluated}} {{the basis of}} calcium-protein interactions in casein systems {{in order to develop}} novel casein-based food matrices with different structures and functionalities. Initially, in Chapter 2 the effects of calcium chelating salts (CCS) (disodium phosphate and trisodium citrate) on calcium-ion activity (ACa++), calcium distribution and protein solubility were investigated in model CaCl 2 solutions (50 mmol L- 1) and <b>rennet</b> <b>casein</b> dispersions (12 % w/w). In both model systems, adding trisodium citrate either alone or as part of a mixed chelating salt system resulted in high levels of dispersed “chelated” calcium; conversely, disodium phosphate addition resulted in lower levels, while the ACa++ decreased with increasing concentration of both CCS. Addition of either salt resulted in only a modest increase in soluble protein. Hence, the results suggested that CCS may play a more subtle role in modulating hydration during manufacture of casein-based matrices than simply solubilising calcium or protein. Therefore, {{despite the fact that the}} <b>rennet</b> <b>casein</b> dispersion used was relatively concentrated, an even more concentrated protein system was required to clarify the role of calcium chelators in casein hydration and matrix formation during manufacture of concentrated casein-based food matrices e. g. processed and analogue cheese. Hence, this work was further built upon in Chapter 3, where a small-scale manufacturing protocol for concentrated casein-based food matrices was developed using a Thermomix. Manufacture was stopped at various time-points, and the matrix formed and any free liquid still remaining were collected. The dispersed and insoluble phases were separated by centrifugation and the calcium (total calcium and ACa++) and protein contents of the dispersed phase analysed. The levels of calcium in the dispersed phase increased and ACa++ decreased during manufacture of casein matrices formulated with CCS; ~ 23 % of the total calcium was solubilised by the end of manufacture. In the absence of CCS, the levels of calcium solubilised were significantly (P 0. 05) detected between matrices containing half or reduced fat levels for any of these attributes. In Chapter 6 CCS-free casein-based matrices prepared with different types of lipid (i. e. milk fat or rapeseed oil) were formulated with high (774 mg. 100 g- 1) or low (357 mg. 100 g- 1) calcium levels again by blending rennet and acid casein. Their physico-chemical characteristics (i. e. composition, texture, microstructure and water mobility) and in vitro digestibility were compared to conventionally formulated high-calcium (723 mg. 100 g- 1) casein matrices made from <b>rennet</b> <b>casein</b> with CCS. The CCS-free, high-calcium matrices were significantly (P < 0. 05) softer than those with low calcium levels and showed the highest rates of disintegration during simulated gastric digestion. Despite having a higher moisture-to -protein ratio, the high-calcium matrices containing CCS had broadly similar hardness values to those of high-calcium concentration prepared without CCS, but had higher cohesiveness. The high-calcium matrices containing CCS had quite a different microstructure and increased water mobility compared to those made without CCS and showed the slowest rate (P < 0. 05) of disintegration in the gastric environment. Gastric resistance was shown to be unaffected by the type of lipid phase present in the matrix. Conversely, fatty acid release was similar for all casein matrices prepared from milk fat, however, high-calcium matrices (CCS-free) prepared from rapeseed oil showed higher lipolysis. The results demonstrated that modifying the composition (i. e. calcium concentration, moisture to protein ratio, inclusion of CCS) and consequently the physical characteristics (e. g. texture, microstructure and water mobility) of casein-based food matrices affects their behavior during in vitro digestion. In particular, the results obtained showed that the physical properties of such matrices could be modified to alter resistance to gastric degradation which may have consequences for the kinetics of nutrient release and delivery of bioactives sentitive to the gastric environment...|$|E
40|$|Adhesion to the {{intestinal}} epithelium {{is considered an}} important feature of probiotic bacteria, which may increase their persistence in the intestine, allowing them to exert their beneficial health effect or promote the colonisation process. However, this feature might be largely dependent on the host specificity or diet. In the present study, we investigated the effect of selected milks and milk protein fractions {{on the ability of}} selected lactobacilli to adhere to the cells of an intestinal model based on co-culture Caco- 2 /HT 29 -MTX cell lines. Most milk digesta did not significantly affect bacterial adhesion except for UHT-treated milk and sheep milk. The presence of UHT-treated milk digesta reduced the adhesion of Lactobacillus gasseri R by 61 % but not that of Lactobacillus casei FMP. However, sheep milk significantly increased the adherence of L. casei FMP (P < 0. 05) but not of L. gasseri R. Among the protein fractions, <b>rennet</b> <b>casein</b> (RCN) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) showed reproducible patterns and strain-specific effects on bacterial adherence. While RCN reduced the adherence of L. gasseri R to < 50 % compared to the control, it did not {{have a significant effect on}} L. casei FMP. In contrast, BSA reduced L. casei FMP adherence to a higher extent than that of L. gasseri R. Whey protein (WH) tended to increase the adherence of both strains by 130 %– 180 %. Recently, interactions between the host diet and its microbiota have attracted considerable interest. Our results may explain one of the aspects of the role of milk in the development of microbiota or support of probiotic supplements. Based on our data, we conclude that the persistence of probiotic strains supplemented as part of dairy food or constitutional microbiota in the gut might be affected negatively or positively by the food matrix through complex strain or concentration dependent effects...|$|E

Commercial herring meals produced by several methods showed only small differences in protein utilization values. In most cases when differences in nitrogen balance values were found they were mainly due to corresponding differences in the protein digestibility. Press cake meals were slightly better utilized than whole meals, this difference was not accounted for by a corresponding difference in digestibility. Steam drying did not produce meals of better protein value than flame drying. No effect on the protein quality of herring meals was found of the preservatives sodium nitrite or formalin used during the storage of the raw material. Extraction of a whole meal with light petrol did not improve the protein quality wheras extraction of another whole meal with ethyl alcohol, ethyl ether and acetone improved the quality. Four foreign fish meals were of about the same protein value as Norwegian herring meal, whereas one was decidedly better. A sand-eel press cake meal was better than a whole meal produced from this raw material. The whole meal was of about the same protein quality as the herring meals. A flash dried whale meat meal was of about equal protein value as herring meals, but decidedly better than a slowly dried whale meal. A squid meal, a spray dried herring solubles meal and two fish off-fall meals were of decidedly poorer protein quality than the herring meals. <b>Rennet</b> <b>casein</b> was of about the same protein value as the herring meals, whereas the reference protein source, spray dried egg albumin, was better {{than all the other}} protein sources tested.

40|$|Extracts of milk coagulating enzymes were obtained, {{adult bovine}} from the abomasums of pasture fed cattle and lamb rennet from the abomasums of {{partially}} milk fed lambs slaughtered {{between three and}} six months of age. Both rennets were, {{in the presence of}} sodium chloride, most stable at 10 °C or lower at pH 4. 7 for adult bovine and pH 4. 1 for lamb. Heat treatment in a sodium chlorine solution (200 mg/ml) at 68 °C for 60 minutes destroyed less than 35 % of the activity of each rennet. Under the same conditions calf rennet was completely inactivated. The cheesemaking properties of adult bovine and lamb rennets were compared with calf rennet. Adult bovine and calf rennets responded similarly to changes of pH however lamb rennet appeared less active than calf rennet at higher pH's when measured in caseinate solution but appeared more active than calf rennet when measured in milk by a curd tension method. The optimum temperature for milk coagulating activity was 40 °C for adult bovine and calf rennets but only 30 °C for lamb rennet when measured in caseinate solution. The curd tension of milk coagulated with the three rennets increased with time but both adult bovine and lamb rennets appeared more sensitive to milk calcium levels than calf <b>rennet.</b> Whole <b>casein,</b> αs-, β- and k-caseins were hydrolysed in a similar manner by the three rennets. Adult bovine rennet was the most proteolytic on whole and β- <b>caseins</b> while calf <b>rennet</b> hydrolysed αs- and k-caseins more rapidly than the other rennets. Two pepsins, of similar amino acid compositions, were isolated, one from adult bovine rennet and one from lamb rennet which also contained a rennin. All three enzymes were purified so that lamb rennin and pepsin each produced only a single band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis but the adult bovine pepsin produced two bands and appeared to be heterogeneous. Cheese made with adult bovine, lamb or a 50 / 50 mixture of calf-adult bovine rennets were compared with cheese made with calf rennet and found to be similar in manufacturing characteristics, flavour and body after three and six months storage at 6 or 13 °C. Polyacrylaride gel electrophoretograms of these cheese after one to twelve months storage at 6 °C showed that the milk coagulant had no effect on the casein degradation products produced in the cheese although the rate of degradation varied slightly. Perchloric acid was found to be a good protein precipitant for quenching casein-rennet reactions and was utilize in a ethod which was developed for assaying milk coagulating activity. Rennet was added to sodium caseinate solution and one minute later the reaction quenched with perchloric acid. The quantity of peptides hydrolysed from the casein was measured at 217 nm and was directly proportional to rennet activity over a limited range of activity. A method for removing mucoproteins, the major impurity in rennet, was developed and a commercial scale plant commissioned. A diethylaminoethyl cellulose based resin, equilibrated with a citrate buffer, retained the rennet enzymes while the mucoproteins passed through uninhibited. The enzymes were eluted with the same buffer made 1. 0 M with sodium chloride. The eluent was more active than the original rennet, was crystal clear in appearance and remained so during twelve months storage when normally mucoproteins would have precipitated out of solution to form a cloud in the rennet...|$|R
40|$|Caseins are {{regarded}} as one of the principal functional food proteins which provide foaming, emulsifying, and water binding properties in food systems. Most of commercial caseins are produced by destabilizing <b>casein</b> micelles by <b>rennet</b> coagulation or acid precipitation, hence the native casein micelles are disrupted. With the advancement of microfiltration technology, it is possible to separate casein by microfiltration (MF) of skim milk while maintaining its micellar structure. The MF retentate of skim milk is called micellar casein concentrate (MCC). Fresh liquid MCC can be further concentrated by ultrafiltration (UF) to remove excess water, and at the same time remove low molecular weight (MW) compounds which can pass through the UF membrane. The liquid MCC can also be spray dried to produce powder. The MCC is a milk protein ingredient with properties that are different from other available protein ingredients, thus it might serve particular functions that other protein ingredients can't deliver. MCC could be used for high-protein, low-lactose drinks, cheesemaking, including production of low-fat Cheddar cheese. Our 1 st objective was to develop a process to produce a high concentration liquid MCC (18 % protein) with a long refrigerated shelf-life. To achieve a long refrigerated shelf-life, the processing of MCC 18 was designed to maximize the removal of low MW compounds, e. g. lactose, nonprotein nitrogen (NPN) which can be easily metabolized by microbes, while minimizing the microbial count in the final product. The production of MCC 18 was replicated 3 times. Skim milk was ultrafiltered (UF) which removed more than a half of lactose and NPN. The UF skim milk retentate was microfiltered (MF) in 3 stages to remove approximately 95 % of the serum protein and further remove lactose and NPN. The final MF retentate was concentrated to 18 % protein by UF, then batch pasteurized. The MCC 18 was collected immediately in sterile plastic vials and stored at 4 °C. The MCC 18 contained 21. 75 % total solids, 18. 27 % true protein, 0. 31 % nonprotein nitrogen and 0. 13 % lactose. The mean aerobic bacterial and spore counts of MCC 18 at day 0 were 2. 1 log cfu/mL and 2. 3 log cfu/mL, respectively. The MCC 18 produced in this study maintained a bacterial count < 20, 000 cfu/mL for 16 wk when stored at refrigeration temperature of 4 °C. The conversion of skim milk to MCC and its coproducts (serum protein concentrate and lactose concentrate) could be used as an alternative to balance milk production seasonality. Our 2 nd objective was to produce low-fat Cheddar cheese (LFCC) by combining reducedfat Cheddar cheese (RFCC) made by a fat removal process with MCC to try to achieve texture and flavor characteristics of full-fat Cheddar cheese (FFCC). The production of LFCC was replicated 3 times with a different batch of commercial FFCC, from which RFCC was produced, as an ingredient for LFCC-making. The LFCC was formulated to achieve 6 % fat, 28 % protein, 1. 2 % salt by combination of RFCC, MCC powder, water, salt, lactic acid and rennet. The 6 % fat target was used to comply with the FDA standard for a low-fat label claim. The pH of the LFCC mixture was adjusted to 5. 3 by lactic acid. Rennet was added, followed by pressing and packaging. Chemical and sensory data were analyzed by ANOVA using the Proc GLM of SAS to determine if there were differences on chemical compositions and sensory among different cheeses. Descriptive sensory scores were used to construct a PCA biplot to visualize flavor profile differences among cheeses. The LFCC had 83 % less fat, 32 % less sodium, higher protein and moisture than FFCC. When the cheese texture was evaluated in the context of a filled-gel model consisting matrix and filler (100 % minus % matrix), the LFCC had lower filler volume than FFCC, yet the LFCC had a softer texture than FFCC. The LFCC contained some of the original FFCC cheese matrix that had been disrupted by the fat removal process, and this original FFCC matrix was embedded in a LFCC matrix formed by the action of <b>rennet</b> on <b>casein</b> from the continuous phase of hydrated MCC. Thus, the texture of the LFCC was desirable and was softer than the FFCC it was made from, whereas commercial RFCC (50 % and 75 % fat reduction) were firmer than the FFCC. The sulfur flavor in LFCC was closer to FFCC, than commercial RFCC. The LFCC had bitter and grape-tortilla off-flavors which came from the dried MCC ingredient. The commercial RFCC and experimental LFCC made in this study were missing the typical aged Cheddar character (catty, nutty, fruity, brothy, milkfat) found in FFCC...|$|R
40|$|Strains of lactic streptococci {{characterized}} as bitter cheese starters multiplied rapidly during normal cheesemaking and reached high {{populations in the}} curd before salting. The multiplication of starter strains which are typically non-bitter was inhibited by the cooking temperatures used in normal Cheddar cheesemaking, even though acid production continued. The populations reached were substantially lower than with bitter starters. If manufacturing conditions were altered so that non-bitter strains reached high numbers in the curd, cheeses were bitter. Conversely, bitterness was absent, or of reduced intensity, when growth of conventionally bitter starters was restricted during cheese manufacture, either {{by the use of}} raised cooking temperatures, or by bacteriophage attack. The results of 60 cheesemaking trials with 10 starter strains confirmed this association between the size of starter population reached during cheesemaking and {{the presence or absence of}} bitterness. A new model is proposed to account for the development of bitterness in Cheddar cheese. Unlike other schemes where the production of bitter peptides is attributed directly to <b>rennet</b> action on <b>casein,</b> the new hypothesis considers that the starter strain is responsible for the formation of bitter-flavoured peptides and does not merely act to remove them. All starters are potentially able to produce either bitter or non-bitter cheese, depending upon the conditions of manufacture (including bacteriophage development) and, hence, the population reached. The response to selected manufacturing conditions rather than any single difference between particular starter strains determines the likelihood of bitterness development. The key cheesemaking trials were repeated using aseptic techniques under controlled bacteriological conditions. Previous studies of aseptically manufactured cheese utilize starters which gave little Cheddar flavour or exhibited pronounced flavour defects. In this investigation, cheese made aseptically with Streptococcus cremoris AM 2 alone, possessed full Cheddar flavour and no off-flavours provided that normal manufacturing procedures were followed. Cheeses made with AM 2 at a low cooking temperature (33 °C) and ML 8 cheeses made at the normal cooking temperature (38 °C) were extremely bitter and lacking in Cheddar flavour. When appropriate levels of bacteriophage were present during manufacture, bitterness was abolished entirely from both the ML 8 and low-cook AM 2 cheeses. There were accompanying increases in Cheddar flavour scores. A search for temperate bacteriophages and lysogenic strains in the lactic streptococci used as starters in cheesemaking showed that the occurrence of lysogeny or defective lysogeny could be relatively widespread. A temperate bacteriophage was inducible from Str. cremoris R 1 by ultraviolet irradiation or mitomycin C treatment. Induced lysates produced plaques on lawns of 3 closely related Str. cremoris strains, AM 1, SK 11 and US 3. Strain SK 11 was readily lysogenised. Str. cremoris AM 1 was the most reliable indicator strain, although the age of the culture used for seeding plates was critical. Zones of lysis, but no plaque formation were observed on lawns of 9 additional Str. cremoris strains. Several other strains of both Str. cremoris and Str. lactis were inducible by either treatment but no indicator strains for the induced phages were found. The significance of lysogeny in cheesemaking cannot yet be assessed...|$|R
40|$|Several polysaccharides are of {{interest}} in dairy products because {{of their ability to}} bind water and other components of the food systems, often leading to major changes in their functional properties. This work aimed to measure and understand the effects of specific polysaccharides in cheeses on the rheological properties related to functionality. The following polysaccharide−cheese systems were used: the microbial polysaccharides xanthan gum (xanthan), high acyl gellan gum (Gellan-H) and low acyl gellan gum (Gellan-L) in processed cheese and an exopolysaccharide (EPS) from a lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in very low fat Mozzarella cheese. Locust bean gum (LBG) was also used with xanthan. Model processed cheese using <b>rennet</b> <b>casein</b> and soya oil was developed on a small scale (30 g) using a controlled temperature, stirrer speed and time of mixing. Initially, lactose content, moisture losses and sample preparation were standardised to lower the variability in rheological measurements. The effects of xanthan, xanthan+LBG, Gellan-H and Gellan-L on the rheology of the processed cheese were studied. As the polysaccharide concentration increased from 0. 0 to 2. 0 % (wt/wt), the fracture stress (firmness) increased whereas the fracture strain (longness) decreased for gellan gum and the effect depended on the polysaccharide. The crossover temperature (where G' = G''), an indicator of viscoelasticity, was increased dramatically by these polysaccharides. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed polysaccharide clusters in the protein matrix for Gellan-H, xanthan and xanthan+LBG but not very distinct clusters for Gellan- L. The effect of Gellan-H and Gellan-L on the water mobility and spreading properties of model processed cheese was investigated. Spreading properties were measured by elongational viscosity, and water mobility was measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry. The NMR data revealed that both polysaccharides significantly reduced the water mobility in the cheese but that the reduction was greater for Gellan-H. The rheology data showed that the addition of polysaccharide increased the elongational viscosity for processed cheese containing both Gellan-H and Gellan-L. In situ exopolysaccharide (EPS) -producing cultures are widely used to improve moisture retention and texture in low fat cheese manufacture but are limited by a low level of EPS production. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop an “all-dairy” ingredient with an increased content of EPS and greater functionality of the EPS for dairy applications such as Mozzarella cheese. An EPS-producing Streptococcus thermophilus was chosen and its growth was optimised for the development of the bioingredient. The fermented biomass was harvested at the end of the exponential phase and freeze dried. The reduced viable cell count and the retention of ropiness of the powder from the drying process enabled a higher level of EPS inoculation in a preliminary Mozzarella cheese manufacturing trial. Pilot-scale very low fat model Mozzarella cheese was manufactured with and without added EPS powder and in situ EPS culture (EPS-C). Large strain rheology, elongational viscosity, melt and NMR relaxometry were used to determine the effects of the in situ and added EPS on the functionality of the cheeses. Cheeses made with the EPS ingredient (EPS-P) retained the highest moisture content (66. 0 %) without any visible serum exudation. The cheeses made with non-EPS-producing cultures (CTR) and EPS-C had lower moisture contents of 57. 5 and 60. 2 % respectively. Such higher moisture retention of the cheeses made with EPS-P was reflected in the rheological properties of the final cheeses. The cheeses made with EPS-P exhibited greater meltability, lower elongational viscosity and lower modulus of deformability (stiffness) and fracture stress than those made with EPS-C and CTR. Future work to develop this area of the functional effects of the addition of polysaccharides to cheese would include protein−polysaccharide interactions and better definition of the water affinity of polysaccharide compared with that of protein...|$|E
