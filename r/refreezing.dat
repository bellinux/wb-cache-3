The main {{concern is that the}} lake could become contaminated with the antifreeze that the Russians used to keep the bore hole from <b>refreezing.</b> Scientists of the United States National Research Council have taken the position that it should be assumed that microbial life exists in Lake Vostok and that after such a long isolation, any life forms in the lake require strict protection from contamination.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of time, a snowpack may settle under its own weight until its density is {{approximately}} 30% of water. Increases in density above this initial compression occur primarily by melting and <b>refreezing,</b> caused by temperatures above freezing or by direct solar radiation. In colder climates, snow lies on the ground all winter. By late spring, snow densities typically reach a maximum of 50% of water. Snow that persists into summer evolves into névé, granular snow, which has been partially melted, refrozen and compacted. Névé has a minimum density of , which is roughly half of the density of liquid water.|$|E

A {{study published in}} Nature in 2013 found that optically thin liquid-bearing clouds extended this July 2012 extreme melt zone, while a Nature Communications study in 2016 suggests that clouds in general enhance Greenland ice sheet's meltwater runoff by more than 30% due to decreased meltwater <b>refreezing</b> in the firn layer at night.|$|E
25|$|At {{temperatures}} {{close to}} the freezing point of water, or during times of moderate solar radiation, a gentle freeze-thaw cycle will take place. The melting and <b>refreezing</b> {{of water in the}} snow strengthens the snowpack during the freezing phase and weakens it during the thawing phase. A rapid rise in temperature, to a point significantly above the freezing point of water, may cause avalanche formation at any time of year.|$|E

40|$|Problem Statement This paper {{responds}} to criticism of Kurt Lewin’s three step model of organizational change in increasingly turbulent environments. It explores whether the <b>refreeze</b> step of Kurt Lewin’s notable three step model is still applicable to organizational change {{processes in the}} age of globalisation and digitalisation. Method Literature review and critical analysis of applied examples are used to provide an overview of Kurt Lewin’s three-step change model. Authors’ observations and reflections are integrated in the discussion. The changing contemporary environment and the implications for the <b>refreeze</b> step of Lewin’s model are accordingly discussed. Conclusions The paper concludes that a balance of stability and movement; of discrete and emergent change; is the reality for today’s organizations, and forms the touchstone for Lewin’s formulation of change theories. Alignment is observed between notions of desired equilibrium in Lewin’s model and the contemporary underpinnings of sustainability. Technology and the modern pace of organizational change are also factors to consider. There has hence been an adaptation of his theoretical heritage that is current and sufficiently robust to withstand the criticisms of the <b>refreeze</b> stage...|$|R

25|$|The snowpack on slopes with sunny {{exposures}} {{is strongly}} influenced by sunshine. Diurnal cycles of thawing and <b>refreezing</b> can stabilize the snowpack by promoting settlement. Strong freeze-thaw cycles result {{in the formation of}} surface crusts during the night and of unstable surface snow during the day. Slopes in the lee of a ridge or of another wind obstacle accumulate more snow {{and are more likely to}} include pockets of deep snow, wind slabs, and cornices, all of which, when disturbed, may result in avalanche formation. Conversely, the snowpack on a windward slope is often much shallower than on a lee slope.|$|E
500|$|Like other {{precipitation}} in cumulonimbus clouds, hail {{begins as}} water droplets. As the droplets rise {{and the temperature}} goes below freezing, they become supercooled water and will freeze on contact with condensation nuclei. A cross-section through a large hailstone shows an onion-like structure. [...] This means the hailstone is made of thick and translucent layers, alternating with layers that are thin, white and opaque. [...] Former theory suggested that hailstones were subjected to multiple descents and ascents, falling into a zone of humidity and <b>refreezing</b> as they were uplifted. [...] This up and down motion {{was thought to be}} responsible for the successive layers of the hailstone. [...] New research, based on theory as well as field study, has shown this is not necessarily true.|$|E
500|$|After deposition, snow {{progresses}} {{on one of}} two {{paths that}} determine its fate, either ablation (mostly by melting) or transitioning from firn (multi-year snow) into glacier ice. During this transition, snow [...] "is a highly porous, sintered material {{made up of a}} continuous ice structure and a continuously connected pore space, forming together the snow microstructure". Almost always near its melting temperature, a snowpack is continually transforming these properties in a process, known as metamorphism, wherein all three phases of water may coexist, including liquid water partially filling the pore space. Starting as a powdery deposition, snow becomes more granular when it begins to compact under its own weight, be blown by the wind, sinter particles together and commence the cycle of melting and <b>refreezing.</b> Water vapor plays a role as it deposits ice crystals, known as hoar frost, during cold, still conditions.|$|E

50|$|Out {{ahead of}} {{the passage of a}} warm front, falling snow may {{partially}} melt and <b>refreeze</b> into a frozen rain drop before it reaches the ground.

Overall, the city features an average of 277 days without measurable precipitation each year. Despite snowstorms often being spread weeks apart, snow often covers the ground for weeks after major winter storms due to the low night temperatures <b>refreezing</b> the snowpack, even when daytime temperatures are above freezing. The maximum daily snow cover has been [...] on December 20, 1967, although the mean maximum for a full winter is only [...] and the lowest maximum only [...] in the dry winter of 1955–56. However, due to the infrequent and scattered nature of the snowstorms, persistent snow pack into spring is rare. One notable exception occurred during the severe winter of 1915–16, when successive Pacific storms buried the city under over [...] of snow, and some residents were snowbound in their homes for several days.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{evidence}} {{in favour of}} glacial flow was known by the early 19th century, other theories of glacial motion were advanced, such as the idea that melt water, <b>refreezing</b> inside glaciers, caused the glacier to dilate and extend its length. As {{it became clear that}} glaciers behaved to some degree as if the ice were a viscous fluid, it was argued that [...] "regelation", or the melting and <b>refreezing</b> of ice at a temperature lowered by the pressure on the ice inside the glacier, was what allowed the ice to deform and flow. [...] James Forbes came up with the essentially correct explanation in the 1840s, although it was several decades before it was fully accepted.|$|E

40|$|Space-borne {{imaging radar}} is a {{suitable}} {{tool for the}} detection of thaw and freeze processes, as the backscattering of radar waves is highly dependent on the dielectric properties of the surface. The backscattered intensity from frozen and unfrozen wet soils in Siberia differed by 3 to 4 dB using C-band radar. The timing of ice formation and melt on lakes and rivers has successfully been determined from space-borne SAR data. The study site is located in the southern central part of the Lena River Delta, Northern Siberia, Russia, at 72 °N, 126 °E. The area is a polygonal arctic tundra landscape, located in a zone of continuous permafrost and covered by ponds, lakes (15 m 2 to 1. 3 km 2) and river arms. A time series of twelve TerraSAR-X images (Stripmap mode) and six RADARSAT- 2 (Fine quad-pol) images acquired during spring 2011 and nine RADARSAT- 2 images recorded during fall 2011 were analyzed for this study. The dates of snow-melt, lake- and river-ice decay and onset, and soil thaw / <b>refreeze</b> obtained from the SAR-based study were compared to meteorological data from Samoylov Island, located in the investigation area, and Tiksi, located about 110 km southeast of the study site. Soil thaw and <b>refreeze</b> was investigated in regions with different soil properties and vegetation cover. Temporal variations of the mean backscattered radar intensity were analyzed for the different land units. The results show that snow-melt events are clearly displayed in the mean backscatter values of the ROIs within the time series. The thaw of the active layer could not be observed in the X-band data, in which the mean backscatter values are mainly the same for both, the frozen and the thawed landscape. The backscatter values of the C-band data are about 3 dB higher during the thaw period than during the freezing period, and vice versa for the <b>refreeze</b> of the soils. Lake- and river-ice decay and <b>refreeze</b> was monitored in the frame of this study as well. Ice-decay could be observed in both, the TerraSAR-X and the RADARSAT- 2 data. Classification methods were applied to distinguish between ice and open water surfaces of lakes and river arms. The results show that lake-ice decay is not only dependent on lake size and location, as the timing of lake-ice decay of neighboring lakes of the same size was different in some cases. Thus it is assumed that lake depths are different, but this needs confirmation from other data sources. A very high spatial image resolution is useful to distinguish land surfaces and water bodies. The ice cover on lakes remains in spring several weeks after the active layer thaw has started. In fall, the ice-onset in the water bodies is later than the <b>refreeze</b> of the soils. As snow-melt, <b>refreeze,</b> thaw processes, and ice-decay on water bodies happen quite quickly, it is necessary to acquire an image series with a high temporal resolution...|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{energy absorbed}} by the snowpack by insolation, {{temperature}} rise or rainfall causes melting on the snowpack surface. The snowmelt water penetrates downward in the snow layer due to diffusion, infiltration or gravity, and some of this water <b>refreezes</b> in the snow layer because it loses heat to the surrounding snow and ice during such downward transfer. The remaining snowmelt water that does not <b>refreeze</b> and reaches {{the bottom of the}} snow layer is supplied to the border between the snowpack and the ground surface as outflow {{from the bottom of the}} snowpack.

40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{have shown}} that the firn layer on the Greenland Ice Sheet features subsurface bodies of liquid water {{at the end of the}} winter season. Using a model with basic firn hydrology, thermodynamics, and compaction in one dimension, we find that a combination of moderate to strong surfacemelt and a high annual accumulation rate is required to form such a perennial firn aquifer. The high accumulation rate ensures that there is pore space available to store water at a depth where it is protected from the winter cold. Low-accumulation sites cannot provide sufficiently deep pore space to store liquid water. However, for even higher accumulation rates, the total cold content of the winter accumulation becomes sufficient to <b>refreeze</b> the total amount of liquid water. As a consequence, wintertime or springtime observations of subsurface liquid water in these specific accumulation conditions cannot distinguish between a truly perennial firn aquifer and water layers that will ultimately <b>refreeze</b> completely...|$|R
