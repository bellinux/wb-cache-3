50|$|Nowadays, {{the canal}} is of {{enormous}} importance to <b>Rhine</b> <b>navigation,</b> {{being part of}} the main Rhine waterway and the first section of the Waal-Rhine fork.|$|E
50|$|From 1934 to the 1940s the <b>Rhine</b> <b>Navigation</b> Office ('Rheinschiffahrtsamt') used 21 {{different}} stamps (3 sets) {{to collect}} Rhine harbour dues. The exact issue date of series 2 and 3 is unknown.|$|E
50|$|Johann Gottfried Tulla (born 20 March 1770 in Karlsruhe; died 27 March 1828 in Paris) was a German {{engineer}} who accomplished the straightening of the <b>Rhine,</b> improving <b>navigation</b> and alleviating {{the effects of}} flooding. His measures gave the Upper Rhine a completely new appearance. The river was deepened and channelled between embankments, new sections were dug to straighten out its meandering course, and numerous small islands were removed. The effect was to reduce the river's length between Basel and Worms from 355 km to 275 km (220 to 170 miles). However, the straightening of the Upper Rhine may have increased the flood risk {{in the region of}} the Middle and Lower Rhine, partial floodplain restoration is performed in a joint program of Germany and France.|$|R
40|$|Rainfall, melted {{snow and}} {{evaporation}} affect the rivers water level and periods of drought may impair freight transport by inland navigation during {{a number of}} days. Indeed, water depth conditions the loading of vessels, hence their transport cost and their competitive position versus alternative modes, rail and trucking. The ECCONET research project funded by the European Commission endeavored to measure the potential effects of these phenomena on the <b>Rhine</b> and Danube <b>navigation</b> {{in the context of}} the observed weather variability and expected climate change scenarios. Many inter-disciplinary issues and methodologies are involved in such an analysis. These were tackled in several technical reports on statistical data, climate evolution prognoses, vessels specifications, adjustment strategies, etc. The present paper uses as inputs part of the wealth of information gathered during that project. The paper presents a long-term multimodal transport analysis over the period 2005 - 2050, which is based on two climate impact scenarios on the Rhine and Danube hydrology. The geographic multimodal transport model NODUS is calibrated with respect to transport costs on estimated 2005 and forecast 2050 matrixes of freight transport flows between origins and destinations within Continental Europe per mode and per type of commodities. The model is used to analyze the effects of climate induced changes in the distributions of water depth on transport costs and on the resulting modal splits between the three competing modes, rail, road and inland waterway transports. The model integrates the effects of planned future European investments in the networks’ infrastructure, and gives some insights on the cost savings that some improved vessels designs and operations could provide...|$|R
5000|$|The Mannheimer Akte (Mannheim Act) (officially : Revised <b>Rhine</b> <b>Navigation</b> Act of 17 October 1868) is an {{international}} agreement that regulates vessel traffic on the Rhine. The principles of the Treaty are:- ...|$|E
50|$|The Commission and its Secretariat {{is based}} in Strasbourg (France), in Le Palais du Rhin. It has 18 staff members who deal with general {{management}} of the 50 meetings annually, external representation, administering social security for ship crews on the Rhine and functioning as {{the seat of the}} <b>Rhine</b> <b>navigation</b> tribunal.|$|E
50|$|Legally, the Commission's {{authority}} {{comes from}} agreements {{made at the}} Congress of Vienna, held in 1815 {{in the aftermath of}} the Napoleonic Wars. The first meeting took place on 15 August 1816 in Mainz. In 1831, the Convention of Mainz was adopted, establishing a number of the first laws governing <b>Rhine</b> <b>navigation.</b> In 1861, the commission's seat was moved to Mannheim, and on 17 October 1868, the Convention of Mannheim was agreed to.|$|E
50|$|Koblenz is a {{principal}} seat of the Mosel and Rhenish wine trade, and also does a large business in the export of mineral waters. Its manufactures include automotive parts (braking systems - TRW Automotive, gas springs and hydraulic vibration dampers - Stabilus), aluminium coils (Aleris Aluminum), pianos, paper, cardboard, machinery, boats, and barges. Since the 17th century, it has been home to the Königsbacher brewery (the Old Brewery in Koblenz's city centre, and now a plant in Koblenz-Stolzenfels). It is an important transit centre for the Rhine railways and for the <b>Rhine</b> <b>navigation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Shipping House (Scheepvaarthuis) is a {{building}} on the western tip of the Waalseiland near Amsterdam harbour {{that is one of}} the top 100 Dutch heritage sites and generally regarded as the first true example of the Amsterdam School, a style characterised by [...] "expressive dynamism, lavish ornamentation and colourful embellishments". It is situated on the Prins Hendrikkade and was erected on the spot where Cornelis Houtman's first trip to the East Indies had begun in 1595. The first part was built 1913 - 1916 (during World War I); the second part was built 1926 -1928. Originally, it was the headquarters of six leading Amsterdam shipping companies: the Netherlands Steamship Company (SMN), the Royal Packet Navigation Company (KPM), the Java-China-Japan Line (JCJL) and the Royal Dutch Steamboat Company (KNSM) with subsidiary New <b>Rhine</b> <b>Navigation</b> Company (NRM) and acquired in 1912 Royal West India Mail Service (KWIM).|$|E
50|$|Under the Rheinschifffahrtsakte (<b>Rhine</b> <b>navigation</b> treaty) of 1831, Mainz {{lost its}} right to impose a stapelrecht (pile right, a medieval right {{apparently}} first granted by Charlemagne to some cities, including Mainz, to require river traders to unload goods in its marketplace for a specified number of days and offer them for sale or make payment in lieu) and thus its trading port and its high tariffs could be avoided. On 13 April 1840 the Taunus Railway between Frankfurt, Mainz-Kastel and Wiesbaden was opened and took transit traffic and tourism away from Mainz. On the other hand, Mainz was the largest city of the Grand Duchy of Hesse and was thus an attractive destination for the developing railway network. In Mainz, the local Hessian Ludwig Railway Company (Hessische Ludwigsbahn) obtained concessions to build railway lines from Mainz, beginning in 1845 with the Mainz-Ludwigshafen railway, on which construction began in 1847. The completion of the line was delayed due to the Revolutions of 1848 to 23 March 1853. The original Mainz station was built on land next to the Rhine outside the city wall between the Wood Tower, Fort Malakoff and today's Museum of Ancient Seafaring, and opened in August 1853.|$|E
