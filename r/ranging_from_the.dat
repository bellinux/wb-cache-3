5|$|Columbian mammoths {{inhabited}} the southern half of North America, <b>ranging</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> northern United States across Mexico {{as far south}} as Costa Rica.

Some areas were covered by grass, herbaceous plants, trees and shrubs; their composition varied from region to region, and included grassland, savanna and aspen parkland habitats. There were also wooded areas; although mammoths would not have preferred forests, clearings could provide them with grass and herbs.|$|E
