5|$|Bill Fulcher supplanted Bud Carson. Fulcher {{appeared}} to be the <b>right</b> <b>choice</b> but quit after two seasons, overwhelmed by the Tech fan base. Fulcher's tenure included a terrible feud with Eddie McAshan, which peaked before the 1972 UGA game. McAshan had requested additional tickets for the game so that his family could attend. Fulcher refused the ticket request and McAshan sat out of practice in protest. Fulcher responded by suspending the quarterback for the UGA game and the upcoming Liberty Bowl. The story exploded on the national scene when Jesse Jackson attended the UGA game, allowing McAshan to sit with him outside of the stadium in protest.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the work carried out by {{accountants}} and auditors requires a high level of ethics. Shareholders, potential shareholders, and other users of the financial statements rely heavily on the yearly financial statements of a company as they can use this information to make an informed decision about investment. They rely on the opinion of the accountants who prepared the statements, as well as the auditors that verified it, to present a true and fair view of the company. Knowledge of ethics can help accountants and auditors to overcome ethical dilemmas, allowing for the <b>right</b> <b>choice</b> that, although it may not benefit the company, will benefit the public who relies on the accountant/auditor's reporting.|$|E

During the campaign, Palin evoked a more strongly divided response than Joe Biden among voters and was viewed both more favorably and unfavorably when compared to her opponent. A plurality of the television audience rated Biden's performance higher at the 2008 vice-presidential debate. Following the presidential election, 69% of Republicans felt Palin had helped John McCain's bid, while 20% felt Palin hurt.

25|$|Willard E. Hotchkiss became Armour Institute's third {{president}} {{at a time}} when the school was still feeling the effects of the Depression. A political scientist and economist, he had been serving as dean of the graduate school of business at Stanford University. With considerable experience in dealing with business economic problems, he was considered the <b>right</b> <b>choice</b> at an important time in Armour Institute's history. Under his leadership, a department of social sciences, fifth-year courses in architecture and in chemical and civil engineering were established. While graduate-level courses had long been offered, few advanced degrees had been awarded. Hotchkiss led the expansion of study programs leading to Master of Science degrees. In his last year as president, the Research Foundation of Armour Institute of Technology was established to develop technological innovation for industry. Two years later, the famous Snow Cruiser vehicle was engineered for use in Admiral Richard Byrd's South Pole expedition.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to perform a program {{evaluation}} of the <b>Right</b> <b>Choices</b> Program to determine the program 2 ̆ 7 s effectiveness in delivering constructive interventions that modify student behavior once students have left the program and have returned to their regular learning environment. This mixed-method evaluation consisted of an experimental-comparison design approach that included interviews with program participants, completing focus groups, and comparison of the number of out-of-school suspensions that participants received after completing the <b>Right</b> <b>Choices</b> Program. The researcher and trained interviewers administered a survey to the 16 certified staff members working in the <b>Right</b> <b>Choices</b> Program including the executive director and the program coordinator. A stratified random proportionate sample was used to produce functionally equivalent groups from the NC WISE data for the out-of-school suspension comparison. This study then examined the benefits and limitations of the program based on teacher and staff perceptions and analysis of the suspension data from NC WISE. The four research questions that guided the study along with their findings were: What are the contextual issues that warrant an alternative program? These issues can be summarized as behavioral challenges, emotional issues, drug and violent offenses, number of out-of-school suspensions, and behind academically. What are the capabilities of this school system to provide alternative sources? The large southeastern urban school district was capable and willing to fund alternative programs that could show positive results as long as drug and violent acts, out-of-school suspensions, and dropouts were trending up. Is the <b>Right</b> <b>Choices</b> Program following its design as planned? The focus groups showed strong agreement that the program was expanding and going in the right direction and there was agreement that the program was going as prescribed and should be continued. What is the impact of the <b>Right</b> <b>Choices</b> Program on student behavior and attitudes? The <b>Right</b> <b>Choices</b> test group received 234 out-of-school suspensions after attending the program and the matched pairs control group received 426 out-of-school suspensions for the same period of time; this represented a 45...|$|R

25|$|The sensational {{incident}} {{of the track}} events was the non-selection of Marlene Matthews in the 4 x 100m relay. Matthews trained with the relay team up until the selection was made but Cuthbert, Strickland, Fleur Mellor and Norma Croker were picked for the team. There was outrage at the selection which increased when Matthews went on to run third in both the 100m and 200m finals. Personally she was devastated and felt {{that she had been}} overlooked for her poor baton change. Strickland was disappointed with the way Matthews was treated and maintained it was an opinion held in New South Wales that she had baton problems. One of the selectors, Doris Magee from NSW, said that selecting Matthews increased the risk of disqualification at the change. But Cuthbert maintained that the selectors made the <b>right</b> <b>choice</b> saying that Fleur Mellor was fresh, a specialist relay runner and was better around the curves than Matthews.|$|E
25|$|Oxenham is {{best known}} for her Abbey Series of 38 titles which chart the lives of the main {{characters}} from their mid-teens until their daughters reach a similar age. The Hamlet Club, formed in the first book in the series Girls of the Hamlet Club, was set up to combat snobbery in the school. Underlying the club’s overt activities of folk-dancing and rambles was its motto 'To be or not to be', and its badge, the Whiteleaf Cross. These were both symbols of deeper meanings. The motto, deliberately using a quote from the Shakespeare play Hamlet, is taken to mean to make the <b>right</b> <b>choice,</b> usually duty above self-interest, when it arises. Throughout the Abbey Series the various main characters come up against this choice and its consequences, and are shown growing and maturing through making difficult decisions. The badge, taken from a landmark local to the area in which the series is set, is also symbolic—as is any cross—of sacrifice.|$|E

The designer also watched what the computer players did, noting [...] "dumb" [...] actions and trying to discover why the computer made them.
