5|$|The League of Nations lacked {{an armed}} force {{of its own}} and {{depended}} on the Great Powers to enforce its resolutions, which they were very unwilling to do. Its two most important members, Britain and France, were <b>reluctant</b> to use sanctions and even more <b>reluctant</b> to resort to military action {{on behalf of the}} League. Immediately after the First World War, pacifism became a strong force among both the people and governments of the two countries. The British Conservatives were especially tepid to the League and preferred, when in government, to negotiate treaties without the involvement of that organisation. Moreover, the League's advocacy of disarmament for Britain, France, and its other members, {{while at the same time}} advocating collective security, meant that the League was depriving itself of the only forceful means by which it could uphold its authority.|$|E

5|$|According to Capitol Record's A, Joe Weinberger, he was {{approached}} by West and almost signed a deal with him, but another person in the company convinced Capitol's president not to. Desperate to keep West from defecting to another label, then-label head Damon Dash reluctantly signed West to Roc-A-Fella Records. Jay-Z later admitted that Roc-A-Fella was initially <b>reluctant</b> to support West as a rapper, claiming that many saw him as a producer first and foremost, and that his background contrasted with that of his labelmates.|$|E

5|$|After the Second World War, {{there was}} a large {{increase}} in the number of gangs in Sophiatown. Part of the reason for this was that there were about 20000 African teenagers in the city who were not at school and did not have jobs. Township youths were unable to find jobs easily. Employers were <b>reluctant</b> to employ teenagers as they did not have any work experience, and many of them were not able to read or write. They also considered them to be undisciplined and weak.|$|E

Initially <b>reluctant,</b> Lecter then assents.|$|E
5|$|After {{these steps}} {{alleviated}} their most urgent needs, the Austro-Hungarian Navy selected the German Type UB II design for its newest submarines in mid 1915.

The Navy agreed to the proposal and purchased the plans from AG Weser of Bremen.|$|E
5|$|Agrippa's {{death in}} 12BC {{elevated}} Tiberius and Drusus {{with respect to}} the succession. At Augustus’ request in 11 BC, Tiberius divorced Vipsania and married Julia the Elder, Augustus' daughter and Agrippa's widow. Tiberius was very <b>reluctant</b> to do this, as Julia had made advances to him when she was married and Tiberius was happily married. His new marriage with Julia was happy at first, but turned sour.|$|E
5|$|Almost all the shrines are nondescript small {{rectangular}} buildings {{without any}} ornamentation. There is no representative of deities adorning {{the outside of}} the buildings. This is in contrast to any other Hindu temple in Sri Lanka or India. Almost all shrines are built of stone except that one dedicated to Valli which shows timber construction. They have been left as originally constructed and there are not any plans to improve upon them, because people are <b>reluctant</b> to tamper with the original shrine complex.|$|E
5|$|Although Adams has {{experimented with}} {{painting}} with watercolor and oil paints (his 1989 covers for Appleseed were rendered {{with a combination}} of ink, watercolor and color pencil), his color work is so sporadic that he says he has to relearn what he has forgotten in the interim each time, and is usually dissatisfied with the results. Because a significant portion of his income is derived from selling his original artwork, he is <b>reluctant</b> to learn how to produce his work digitally.|$|E

Later in the month, a memorial service was held in London in Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|Although Timberlake {{expressed}} interest in recording songs with rock influences, Timbaland was initially <b>reluctant</b> to pursue the idea {{because he was not}} accustomed to producing such music. Nonetheless, he suggested that they could produce a handful, since they were afraid of alienating Timberlake's urban fan base. Because of this concern, they produced several reprises, encores and preludes with a rock influence, instead of full-length songs.|$|E
