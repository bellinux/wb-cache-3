The effects of depth-of-cuts are not conclusive in all aspects except for the observation of higher cutting tool wear for lower depth-of-cut.

40|$|Abstract: Recent {{experiments}} {{into the}} ductile-regime machining of Silicon Nitride {{have confirmed that}} Silicon Nitride behaves in a ductile manner under high pressure and micrometer depths of cut. This paper reports results {{from a series of}} numerical simulations carried out to model and understand the ductile machining of Silicon Nitride. The cutting process is modeled using the commercial software package ADVANTEDGE. Effects of various parameters like cutting speed, feed, <b>rake</b> <b>angles</b> and tool tip radius that favor brittle-to-ductile transitions are the focus of the parametric study. Feed, tool tip radius and depth of cut are in the range of tens of microns while speeds are in the range of 1 m/min to 300 m/min. Results from this study indicate that ductile cutting may be possible at high speeds, small tool tip radii, high negative <b>rake</b> <b>angles</b> and small depths of cut...|$|R

50|$|The {{heads of}} some burrs (such as {{tungsten}} carbide burrs) contain the blades which remove material. These blades may be positioned at different angles {{in order to}} change {{the property of the}} burr. More obtuse angles will produce a negative <b>rake</b> <b>angle</b> which increases the strength and longevity of the burr. More acute angles will produce a positive <b>rake</b> <b>angle</b> which has a sharper blade, but which dulls more quickly. The heads of other commonly used burrs are covered in a fine grit which has a similar cutting function to blades (e.g. high speed diamond burrs).|$|E
50|$|Depending on the {{material}} being milled, and what task should be performed, different tool types and geometry may be used.
