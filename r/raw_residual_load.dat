40|$|The {{electricity}} supply {{will become more}} volatile in energy systems with increasing shares of Renewable Energy Sources (RES). Since electricity demand varies as does the supply by RES, the remaining <b>residual</b> <b>load</b> must be covered by flexible technologies that are required to balance {{the different types of}} fluctuations. In this study, these flexibility options are divided into three categories: increasing the <b>residual</b> <b>load,</b> decreasing the <b>residual</b> <b>load</b> and shifting the electricity demand / supply temporally or spatially. Furthermore, typical technological options are discussed for each category, and four flexibility criteria are used to compare their technical and economic characteristics. These include the activation time, duration of flexibility provision, number of activations and activation costs. The study reveals that various options exist and no one technology dominates. However, within the flexibility categories, it can be shown that some appliances have advantages in three of the four categories compared to the other options. Ultimately, the choice of the most appropriate flexibility option depends on the requirements of the energy system. It can be concluded that a mix of technologies will be needed to cover the future flexible demand that may include short-term changes of the <b>residual</b> <b>load</b> as well as long-term downturns of RES generation...|$|R

These piles were installed in the CEFEUP/ISC' 2 experimental site, located in the Campus of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (Portugal), in a contact zone between the gneissic rocks and the granite mass.

40|$|Conference paperThe {{development}} of <b>residual</b> (or locked-in) <b>loads</b> in driven pre-formed piles {{has been investigated}} extensively over the past 40 years or so. In contrast, cast-in-situ piles are often erroneously assumed {{to be free of}} <b>residual</b> <b>loads.</b> This paper aims to review the limited number of published studies into the processes which lead to the {{development of}} <b>residual</b> <b>loads</b> in bored, augered and driven cast-in-situ piles during curing. Unlike precast piles, concrete for cast-in-situ piles must be given sufficient time to cure and develop strength in the ground prior to loading.

By continuously monitoring strain and temperature development between casting and static load testing, these processes can be identified as initial concrete set, hydration curing and soil disturbance and consolidation effects in the vicinity of the pile. A limited database of reported studies which monitor such processes is presented, together with the proposed methods for deducing the level of <b>residual</b> <b>load</b> from strains present at the time of testing.

The high <b>residual</b> <b>load</b> obtained from the series reinforced with 5 DH {{may be the result}} of a unique combination of a lengthy hook, a high ductility wire and high tensile strength. Regarding the series reinforced with 5 DH fibres, there is also a noteworthy observation; the CMOD value corresponds to the maximum load is equal to 2  mm, while relatively small CMOD values (less than 0.7  mm) were registered for the other types of the hook ended fibres. In the case of the series reinforced with 3 DH- 35, the decrease of the <b>residual</b> <b>load</b> up to 53  % of its peak load was observed, mainly due to the fibre pulled out and fully deformed at small crack widths. On the other hand, the series reinforced with 5 DH fibres showed high resistance to fibre pullout and resulted in somewhat lower regression of <b>residual</b> peak <b>load</b> at larger crack widths. Thus it could be attributed to the fact that the fibre mechanical anchorage is much higher for 5 DH fibres than those offered by other hooked-end fibre types.|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, {{modeling}} {{investment and}} dispatch problems in electricity economics {{has been limited}} by computation power. Due to this limitation, simplifications are applied. One common practice, for example, {{is to reduce the}} temporal resolution of the dispatch by clustering similar load levels. The increase of intermittent electricity from renewable energy sources (RES-E) changes the validity of this assumption. RES-E already cover a certain amount of the total demand. This leaves an increasingly volatile residual demand to be matched by the conventional power market.

The instrumentation can range from a telltale or two through a sophisticated array of strain gages, and from tests with the limited purpose of separating shaft and toe resistances through tests {{for the purpose of}} detailing the shaft resistance distribution along the pile.

40|$|TheNetherlands is a densely {{populated}} country and {{is located in}} an areawhere the shallowsubsurfacemainly consists ofHolocene and Pleistocene soils. To build permanent structures, enough bearing capacity is needed to provide sufficient support for these structures. However, Holocene (soft) soils typically do not provide sufficient support. In {{the western part of}} the country, the soft soils from the Holocene overlay the stiffer Pleistocene soils. To still be able to construct at locations where soft soils are found, pile foundations are needed to transfer the loads through the soft soil onto the stiff soil in order to provide for sufficient bearing capacity. The normativemethod for determining pile bearing capacity in the Netherlands uses a relatively straightforward semi-empirical approach known as the 4 D/ 8 D or the Dutch method. This method was based on the work of [vanMierlo and Koppejan, 1952] who introduce the logarithmic spiral theory. Apart from small modifications and elaborations, the method has been used ever since. To get to a reasoned solution on how to calculate and design pile foundations the Eurocode [Normcommissie 351 006 ’Geotechniek’, 2017 a] was introduced. One of the (original) aims of the Eurocode was to harmonise rules and regulations regarding, amongst others, pile foundations. To prepare this harmonisation, Belgium, France and the Netherlands took a closer look into their calculation methods. For the Netherlands this research was performed by a committee who presented their findings in CUR 229 - “Axiaal belaste palen” [CUR B&I, 2010]. From CUR 229 it was found the pile tip capacity was overestimated. In other words, the calculated pile tip capacity was higher than the measured pile tip capacity. This overestimation led to a reduction of ®p of 30 % starting on the 1 st of January 2017. (®p is the factor which reduces the pile tip resistance for different pile types, see Appendix A.) A point of interest is the overestimation of the pile tip capacity, which seems to become more prominent when the pile goes deeper into a non-cohesive soil. It was even found, a lower ®p is not required for piles installed less than 8 D into the bearing layer. The reduction of ®p seems to contradict with practice, because no cases of damage are known regarding the bearing capacity of pile foundations. Several explanations for this might be valid. For example, hidden safeties may prevent overall safety issues to arise. In addition, errors may occur in the determination of the pile capacity from pile load tests or in the Dutch method for calculating pile tip capacity. This leads to the two main subjects for this thesis. On the one hand, the hidden mechanism of <b>residual</b> <b>loads</b> is considered and on the other hand, the zone of influence at the pile tip during failure is analysed. To analyse the above-named subjects, the 4 D/ 8 D method was put under scrutiny. First, it was compared to other (international) analytical methods, which determine the bearing capacity directly from CPT data. Furthermore, the zone of influence around the pile tip is considered inmore detail by analysing the analytical approach and comparing this to the results of numerical models. This led to the conclusion that the observed overestimation can partly be explained by the inaccuracy of the assumed zone of influence around the pile tip, especially regarding the extent of this zone above the pile tip (8 D). As this extent is too large, the 4 D/ 8 D method results in a too low average cone resistance in the 8 D zone (for piles installed less than 8 D into the bearing soil layer). In combination with the ‘old’ ®p, this leads to a reasonably accurate estimation of the pile tip capacity compared to the measured tip capacity. However, the observed extent of the zone of influence above the pile tip, in the FEMmodels, is in the order of 1 to 1. 5 D. The average cone resistance in this zone will in most cases be higher than in a zone extending 8 D above the pile tip. The hidden mechanism of <b>residual</b> <b>loads</b> is implemented in a numerical model, with the use of a static load on top of the pile. The <b>residual</b> <b>loads</b> are caused by the installation of the pile and so, they are considered to be installation effects. No analytical or numerical models or procedures were found in literature to quantify the xiii xiv 0. Abstract <b>residual</b> <b>load.</b> <b>Residual</b> <b>loads</b> were implemented using a procedure defined in this thesis, taking into account the maximum pile tip capacity as indicator for the order of magnitude for the <b>residual</b> <b>load.</b> This is done, because a drawback of FEM models is; they are not able to calculate large strains, which occur during installation of a pile. Therefore the installations effects (like <b>residual</b> <b>loads)</b> have to be implemented indirectly. The horizontal compression due to installation is modelled as an installation effect according to the procedure of [Broere and van Tol, 2006]. Both installation effects are validated using data from CUR 229 and they are subjected to a sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, the softening or peak behaviour of soils might have a significant influence on the zone of influence around the pile and on the <b>residual</b> <b>loads,</b> as for both cases, the soil is loaded up to failure. Most regular constitutive models do not take into account this behaviour. Due to the fact the Hypo Plasticity (HP) model takes into account this peak behaviour, it was used to performthe FEM analysis. During the final stages of this thesis, scaled pile load tests were performed. The results of these tests were analysed to find the presence and order of magnitude of the <b>residual</b> <b>load</b> in a pile. However, as the test results were incomplete, only first assumptions were made that indicated the presence of <b>residual</b> <b>loads.</b> No substantiated conclusion could be drawn regarding the magnitude. Due to the observed importance of <b>residual</b> <b>loads</b> in this thesis, the <b>residual</b> <b>loads</b> should be measured during load tests more extensively using Osterberg cells or fibre optics. The installation effects are modelled in the Hypo Plasticity model with reasonable confidence, but future research is needed on models that can model the installation process (for example theMaterial PointMethod). Furthermore, the small strain parameters of the HP model should be taken into account. This thesis questions the 4 D/ 8 D method and shows some of its inaccuracies. However, more extensive research should be done considering the extent of the zone of influence and the limiting value defined by in the Dutchmethod. Also, the interaction between the shaft and the pile tip resistance has to be evaluated, as this thesis indicates they interfere with each other if the Dutch method is considered. Besides the zone of influence and the <b>residual</b> <b>loads,</b> the failure criterion stated by NEN 9997 - 1 is questioned. Failure of a pile happens when the pile tip has moved 10 %D [Normcommissie 351 006 ’Geotechniek’, 2017 a], but the FEM models show more displacements at failure, where failure is defined by themoment the models cannot stabilise anymore and therefore fail to calculate for a certain load step.

Some of these studies have also speculated that flexible capture systems may be valuable in future electricity systems with high shares of renewable energy as they could allow fossil fuel plants with capture to rapidly respond to changes in <b>residual</b> <b>load.</b> However, few studies have actually examined the role that plants with flexible capture could play in future power systems. Thus, this study examines the role that power generation with flexible capture systems could play in a future European power system where 80 % of generation (by energy) is supplied by renewables. The results show that conventional base- and mid-load capacity decreases while the peak-load capacity (i. e., open cycle gas turbines) increases.

Three energy scenarios out to 2040 were defined, one oriented towards the Integrated Energy and Climate Protection Concept of the Federal State Government and two alternatives. Timely-resolved load profiles for gas and electricity for 2015, 2020, 2030 and 2040 have been generated at the level of individual municipalities. The profiles include residential and industrial electrical load, gas required for heating (conventional and current-controlled CHP), as well as gas and electricity demand for mobility.

To investigate the contribution of PEVs, the availability of mobile battery storage and the control mechanism for load management are crucial. This study therefore combined the following: a stochastic model to determine mobility behavior, an optimization model to minimize vehicle charging costs and an agent-based electricity market equilibrium model to estimate variable electricity prices. The variable electricity prices are calculated based on marginal generation costs. Hence, because of the merit order effect, the electricity prices provide incentives to consume electricity when the supply of renewable generation is high.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to explore the relationship between fire insult and the remaining flexural strength of a thermally damaged commonly used composite plastic. The samples were subjected to 20 kW/m through 40 kW/m heat fluxes for varying amounts of time. Selected samples were allowed to ignite to ensure that both radiant and fire exposures were considered. Resulting sample temperatures and mass loss quantities were recorded as a function of time through the use of implanted thermocouples and a load cell. All samples were allowed to cool in a zero moisture environment prior to being structurally loaded to failure using a 3 -point bending machine. The results obtained tend to demonstrate a clear linear relationship between the depth of un-charred material (on a Non-Ignition sample) and its <b>residual</b> <b>load</b> carrying capacity. Furthermore, a linear correlation between the total amount of energy imposed on a sample and its residual strength is evident. The type of correlation depends on whether the sample ignited or not...|$|R
30|$|After {{peak load}} was reached, the load {{carrying}} capacity deterioration started, the lower the fibres content, the higher the loss of strength. The load bearing capacity descends immediately after the first visible crack initiated, which {{may be attributed to}} the bond slip of some fibres at the cracked surface. This also reflected the higher loss of strength for the shorter fibre reinforced concrete as the short fibre may be relatively easier to be pulled out. Gradual reduction of loading capacity continues until all fibres slip from the cracking regions. As mentioned, the maximum load increases with an increase of fibre content for all four types of hooked-end steel fibres. However, the <b>residual</b> <b>load</b> of the tested beams with long fibres also shows a more ductile trend than that with short fibres over the entire CMOD range. This may be attributed to the positive effect of long steel fibres, as the short fibres are gradually pulled out with the increase of the CMOD, while the high mechanical anchoring provided by the lengthy hook of 4 DH and 5 DH fibres continues to transfer the stress between fibres and matrix, generating higher strain and stress (<b>residual</b> <b>load)</b> at the post-cracking stage.|$|R
30|$|To {{serve the}} {{flexible}} charging and the static household loads, the utility needs to optimally procure gas turbine (GT) capacity, dispatch this capacity and decide on transactions on the reserve market {{while at the}} same time integrating available (zero-cost) wind generation. To this end, flexible loads should ideally be scheduled such that the <b>residual</b> <b>load,</b> which needs to be covered through costly conventional generation, is minimized. Furthermore, scheduling needs to establish a generation plan which ensures efficient operation of the conventional generators.|$|R
30|$|The peak <b>loads</b> and <b>residual</b> {{strength}} of SFRC beams under 3 -point bending increased {{with the increase}} of fibre dosage. The order of performance in terms of peak load was: 5 DH- >  4 DH- >  3 DH- 60 - >  3 DH- 35. The <b>residual</b> <b>loads</b> evaluated at 4  mm CMOD was about 91, 87, 79 and 53  % of their peak load for series reinforced with 80  kg/m 3, of 5 DH, 4 DH, 3 DH- 60 and 3 DH- 35 respectively.|$|R
40|$|Subject of this {{analysis}} is to show how storage is operated optimally under renewable and load uncertainty in the electricity system context. We estimate a homogeneous Markov Chain representation of the <b>residual</b> <b>load</b> in Germany in 2014 on an hourly basis and design a very simple dynamic stochastic electricity system model with non-intermittent generation techno - logies and storage. We compare these results to perfect foresight findings and identify a significant over estimation of the storage potential under perfect foresight...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} for {{assessing}} the grid interaction of a building’s electricity consumption and generation is presented. It consists of the Grid Support Coefficients GSCabs and GSCrel. GSCabs "weights" the electricity consumption profile with a time-resolved reference quantity which expresses the availability of electricity in the public grid (here: stock electricity price, <b>residual</b> <b>load,</b> cumulative energy consumption or fraction of wind and PV in the electricity mix). GSCrel relates GSCabs to the worst and best achievable values {{on a scale of}} − 100 to 100 in order to increase the comparability of the results. The new evaluation method is applied to analyze the electricity consumption and/or production of 52 different energy supply systems in buildings, where detailed monitoring data are available. These examples include twelve heat pumps or chillers in office buildings, 38 heat pumps in residential buildings and two combined heat and power units (CHP) in multi-family buildings, all located in Germany. The in-depth analysis shows that the analyzed present-day buildings predominantly consume electricity at times with a low or average electricity availability. Optimal scheduling of all heat pumps could flatten the <b>residual</b> <b>load</b> significantly. In order to achieve this, thermal storages several times larger than the ones currently installed would be required...|$|R
40|$|Electricity {{generation}} from {{renewable energy}} sources (RES-E) is supposed to increase signi ficantly within the coming decades. However, uncertainty about the progress of necessary infrastructure investments, public acceptance and cost developments of renewable energies renders the achievement of political plans uncertain. Implementation risks of renewable energy targets are challenging for investment planning, because different RES-E shares fundamentally change the optimal mix of dispatchable power plants. Speci cally, uncertain future RES-E deployment paths induce uncertainty about the steepness of the <b>residual</b> <b>load</b> duration curve and the hourly <b>residual</b> <b>load</b> structure. In this paper, we show how uncertain future RES-E penetrations impact the electricity system and try to quantify effects for the Central European power market. We use a multi-stage stochastic investment and dispatch model to analyze effects on investment choices, electricity generation and system costs. Our main findings include that the uncertain achievement of RES-E targets significantly effects optimal investment decisions. First, a higher share of technologies with a medium capital/operating cost ratio is cost-efficient. Second, the value of storage units in systems with high RES-E penetrations might decrease. Third, {{in the case of}} the Central European power market, costs induced by the implementation risk of renewable energies seem to be rather small compared to total system costs...|$|R
