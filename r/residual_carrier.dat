(so called <b>residual</b> <b>carrier).</b> Sometimes 12.5% is used as the <b>residual</b> <b>carrier</b> so the output power applied to the antenna system is considerably lower than the nominal power.|$|E

40|$|A semiempirical model {{describing}} {{the influence of}} interface states on characteristics of gate capacitance and drain resistance versus gate voltage of top gated graphene field effect transistors is presented. By fitting our model to measurements of capacitance–voltage characteristics and relating the applied gate voltage to the Fermi level position, the interface state density is found. Knowing the interface state density allows us to fit our model to measured drain resistance–gate voltage characteristics. The extracted values of mobility and <b>residual</b> charge <b>carrier</b> concentration are compared with corresponding results from a commonly accepted model which neglects the effect of interface states. The authors show that mobility and <b>residual</b> charge <b>carrier</b> concentration differ significantly, if interface states are neglected.

50|$|In {{analogue}} broadcasting the {{composite video signal}} modulates the carrier by a type of amplitude modulation named VSB. The polarity of the modulation is negative, i.e., higher {{the level of the}} CVS, lower the level of the RF signal. If the level of CVS is 0 volt the level of the RF signal is % 100. The modulation index is so arranged that, the maximum level of CVS yields a RF level of % 10 (sometimes % 12.5). This value is known as the level of the <b>residual</b> <b>carrier.</b> If the modulation index yields more than % 10 for maximum level input (high <b>residual</b> <b>carrier),</b> the efficiency of the transmission drops, i.e., low contrast. On the other hand, if the RF level is below % 10 (low <b>residual</b> <b>carrier),</b> aural and visual signals begin to interfere each other. So {{it is important to keep}} %10 for 1000 mV input.|$|E
5000|$|An {{example of}} the {{modulated}} carrier {{is shown in the}} accompanying figure. In this figure, the level of the modulating VF signal is 1 volt (white level). 1 V. yields <b>residual</b> <b>carrier</b> (10%) [...] Short duration full carrier (100%) is the sync pulse and the 73% is so called back porch (black level). The duration of the signal is approximately 100 µs.|$|E
5000|$|The signal modulates {{a carrier}} by {{amplitude}} modulation, where {{an increase in}} the video modulating signal produces a decrease in the carrier amplitude, called [...] "negative modulation". When there is no modulating signal, the carrier has the full level and when there is a modulating video frequency (VF) signal the level of IF is lower. Since the level when transmitting a black scene is lower than the white level, the level of carrier when transmitting black is higher than the level of carrier when transmitting white. The modulators are set to yield 10% or 12.5% of carrier level when modulated by 1 V signal (which corresponds to white scene) This percentage is known as <b>residual</b> <b>carrier.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Most blind channel {{estimation}} methods for Direct-Sequence Code-Division Multiple-Access (DS/CDMA) systems {{does not take}} into account the carrier offset resulting from imperfect carrier recovery. The method presented here estimates jointly the carrier offset and propagation channel thus allowing for the carrier offset compensation. Our technique combines the subspace decomposition with a Jacobi-like Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA) and exploits the fact that CM criterion is invariant to the presence of <b>residual</b> <b>carriers.</b> Channel identifiability is proved for the case when different users have different carrier offsets. Numerical studies illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

The metal-insulator transition at $T_{SDW}$ = 12 K leads {{to a reduction in}} carrier concentration by seven orders of magnitude. Below 1 K, charge transport displays the behavior known as Variable Range Hopping (VRH). Until now, the Seebeck response of electrons in this regime has been barely explored and even less understood.

5000|$|Single {{sideband}} {{transmission is}} a form of amplitude modulation but in effect filters the result of modulation. An amplitude-modulated signal has frequency components both above and below the carrier frequency. If one set of these components is eliminated as well as the <b>residual</b> <b>carrier,</b> only the remaining set is transmitted. This saves power in the transmission, as roughly 2/3 of the energy sent by an AM signal is unnecessary to recover the information contained on it. It also saves [...] "bandwidth", allowing about one-half the carrier frequency spacing to be used. The drawback is that the receiver is more complicated, since it must re-recreate the carrier to recover the signal. Small errors in the detector process can greatly affect the pitch of the received signal, so single side band is not usual for music or general broadcast. Single side band is used for long-range voice communications by ships and aircraft, Citizen's Band, and amateur radio operators. LSB (lower sideband) is generally used below 9 MHz and USB (upper sideband) above 9 MHz.|$|E

A significantly reduced Mg incorporation in the top barrier related to the generation of stacking faults is observed for heteroepitaxial samples. Exciton localization is observed for both types of samples, while an enhancement of the exciton binding energy compared to bulk ZnO is only found for homoepitaxial SQWs for 2 nm <= d(W) <= 4 nm. Consistently, for homoepitaxial samples, the carrier dynamics are mainly governed by radiative recombination and carrier cooling processes at temperatures below 170 K, whereas thermally activated non-radiative recombination dominates in heteroepitaxial samples.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{contributions}} to the electrical resistance of monolayer and bilayer graphene, revealing transitions between different regimes of charge carrier scattering. In monolayer graphene at low densities, a nonmonotonic variation of the resistance is observed {{as a function of}} temperature. Such behaviour is consistent with the influence of scattering from screened Coulomb impurities. At higher densities, the resistance instead varies {{in a manner consistent with}} the influence of scattering from acoustic and optical phonons. The crossover from phonon-, to charged-impurity, limited conduction occurs once the concentration of gate-induced carriers is reduced below that of the <b>residual</b> <b>carriers.</b> In bilayer graphene, the resistance exhibits a monotonic decrease with increasing temperature for all densities, with the importance of short-range impurity scattering resulting in a "universal" density-independent (scaled) conductivity at high densities. At lower densities, the conductivity deviates from this universal curve, pointing to the importance of thermal activation of carriers out of charge puddles. These various assignments, in both systems, are made possible by an approach of "differential-conductance mapping", which allows us to suppress quantum corrections to reveal the underlying mechanisms governing the resistivity...|$|R

40|$|In {{a system}} {{according}} to the proposed technique (see figure), the signal received by each element of the array antenna would be subjected to downconversion, and spread-spectrum demodulation and correlation as necessary; this processing would be performed separately from, and simultaneously with, similar processing of signals received by the other antenna elements. For the GPS implementation, following downconversion to baseband, the signals would be digitized, and all subsequent processing would be digital. In the digital process, <b>residual</b> <b>carriers</b> would be removed and each signal would be correlated with a locally generated model pseudo random-noise code, all following normal GPS procedure. As part of this procedure, accumulated values would be added in software and the resulting signals would be phase-shifted in software by the amounts necessary to synthesize the desired antenna directional gain pattern of peaks and nulls. The principal advantage of this technique over the conventional radio-frequency-combining technique is that the parallel digital baseband processing of the signals from the various antenna elements would be a relatively inexpensive and flexible means for exploiting the inherent multiple-peak/multiple-null aiming capability of a phased-array antenna. In the original intended GPS application, the peaks and nulls could be directed independently for each GPS signal being tracked by the GPS receiver. This will improve the SNR simultaneously for each GPS signal being tracked while steering multiple nulls toward sources of interference.
