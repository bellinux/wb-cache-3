50|$|Population ageing {{arises from}} two (possibly related) {{demographic}} effects: increasing longevity and declining fertility. An increase in longevity raises {{the average age}} of the population by increasing the numbers of surviving older people. A decline in fertility reduces the number of babies, and as the effect continues, the numbers of younger people in general also <b>reduce.</b> <b>Of</b> these two forces, it is declining fertility that is the largest contributor to population ageing in the world today. More specifically, it is the large decline in the overall fertility rate over the last half century that is primarily responsible for the population ageing in the world’s most developed countries. Because many developing countries are going through faster fertility transitions, they will experience even faster population ageing than the currently developed countries in the future.|$|E

5000|$|If the {{temperature}} in the building is higher than {{the temperature}} outside, the heat leaks through the elements of construction. Windows are usually the most vulnerable elements of the building in terms of heat losses. The heat loss though window constructions is about 20-25% of total heat loss. Heat insulation of translucent constructions can be improved by increasing the number of glasses and chambers of multiple glass panes, but will result in increased construction cost and decreased optical transmission. The reasonable alternative is the usage of low-emissivity glass, which is practically the same as ordinary glass in terms of optical transmission, but it also reflects the heat radiation back into the room. The major indicator which characterizes the ability of glass to reflect heat radiation is its emissivity (E) or the [...] "emission factor". The emission factor of ordinary glass is 0.83; the factor for low-emissive glass can reach 0.03, so that more than 90% of accumulated heat will be reflected back into the room. The lower the emission factor is, the more effective is the material to reflect the heat, and the more heat it will accumulate. To compare, the emission factor of a multiple glass pane with two chambers, which is made of ordinary glass, {{is the same as the}} emission factor of a multiple glass pane with one chamber, which was produced with usage of low-emissive glass. Besides energy-efficient functions in cold seasons of the year, low-emissive glass possesses the ability to reflect the excess of outside heat energy in summer seasons; the optical transmission coefficient is affected insignificantly in this way. The additional factor of <b>reduce</b> <b>of</b> heat transfer of multiple glass panes is the usage of low thermal conductivity gases - Ar or Kr - to fill the chambers. In present-day multiple glass panes Ar is more often used, which helps to reduce heat losses by 10-20%, though the cost of multiple glass panes is insignificantly increased.|$|E
