50|$|In {{the last}} decade, the {{research}} and development of photovoltaic (PV) system technology has been accelerated due to its free of pollution, silent operation, long life time and low maintenance cost and the improvement of solar cell technologies and the increasing demand for PV systems have led to a reduction of the price of PV module, the costs of PV systems are still too high. Therefore, it is an important to design the PV systems which can maximize energy production from Sun through solar modules. The output power of solar module is a function of solar <b>radiance,</b> <b>temperature</b> and operating point because of its nonlinear current-voltage (I-V) relationship. Therefore, the maximum power point tracker (MPPT) is widely used to maximize the power output of the solar module. As such, many MPPT techniques have been developed and implemented. The techniques used generally are Hill Climbing, Perturb and Observe (P&O), Incremental Conductance (INC), Factional Open-Circuit Voltage and Fractional Short-Circuit Current. The past results show that P&O and Incremental Conductance are in general the most efficient techniques. For these two techniques, the derivatives of voltage and power measured from the solar module are still required.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{a context}} of {{radiative}} temperature field measurement, this paper deals with an innovative method, called bicolor near infrared thermoreflectometry, for the measurement of true temperature fields without prior knowledge of the emissivity field of an opaque material. This method is achieved by a simultaneous measurement, in the near infrared spectral band, of the <b>radiance</b> <b>temperature</b> fields and of the emissivity fields measured indirectly by reflectometry. The theoretical framework of the method is introduced and {{the principle of the}} measurements at two wavelengths is detailed. The crucial features of the indirect measurement of emissivity are the measurement of bidirectional reflectivities in a single direction and the introduction of an unknown variable, called the ``diffusion factor. '' <b>Radiance</b> <b>temperature</b> and bidirectional reflectivities are then merged into a bichromatic system based on Kirchhoff's laws. The assumption of the system, based on the invariance of the diffusion factor for two near wavelengths, and the value of the chosen wavelengths, are then discussed in relation to a database of several material properties. A thermoreflectometer prototype was developed, dimensioned, and evaluated. Experiments were carried out to outline its trueness in challenging cases. First, experiments were performed on a metallic sample with a high emissivity value. The bidirectional reflectivity was then measured from low signals. The results on erbium oxide demonstrate the power of the method with materials with high emissivity variations in near infrared spectral band...|$|E

Geophysica M 55 aircraft observations of water vapor, ozone, aerosol and CO 2 during August 2006 show perturbed values at altitudes ranging from 14 km to 17 km (above the main convective outflow) and satellite data indicates that air detrainment is likely to have originated from convective cloud east of the flights.

This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} radio occultation (RO) {{measurements of the}} tropopause region are able to improve radiometric tropospheric profile retrievals, as represented by the ATOVS (Advanced TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder) temperature and humidity soundings from the NOAA 16 (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) satellite. First, a simulation study is presented wherein a statistical regression was used to infer temperature and humidity retrievals from ATOVS brightness temperatures and GPS (Global Positioning System) refractivity data. The ATOVS and GPS combination yields improved tropospheric profiles when compared to those inferred from either system alone. A sensitivity test was also performed to investigate how large GPS refractivity error can be and still improve the radiometric retrievals; even tripling the GPS refractivity observation errors yields improved retrievals. Second, the preparations to repeat the same study with real GPS (CHAMP) and ATOVS data are described. Collocations of GPS and CHAMP data were collected and the CHAMP data were evaluated against NWP profiles.
