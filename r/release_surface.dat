40|$|Perforated {{matrices}} {{were obtained}} using as excipient hydroxypropylcelluloses having different viscosity degrees. Furosemide release {{was affected by}} the polymer viscosity, while it {{was not related to}} the <b>releasing</b> <b>surface</b> area. In fact, the matrix having the highest hole diameter, and consequently the lowest <b>releasing</b> <b>surface</b> area, showed the highest release rate. The application of an impermeable coating on all the surfaces, except the hole <b>surface,</b> restricted the <b>releasing</b> <b>surface</b> area reducing the release rate. Furosemide release from the perforated coated matrices was the same regardless of the hole diameter (surface) as the data were related to the unitary <b>releasing</b> <b>surface.</b> The comparative analysis of the drug release mechanism showed the decrease of the erosion (polymer dissolution) component and the increase of the drug diffusion component of the process as the perforated matrices were coated. These results can be justified by the restriction of the matrix swelling produced by the impermeable coating. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|Frontogenesis is a {{meteorological}} {{process of}} tightening of horizontal temperature gradients to produce fronts. In the end, {{two types of}} fronts form: cold fronts and warm fronts. A cold front is a narrow line where temperature decreases rapidly. A warm front is a narrow line of warmer temperatures and essentially {{where much of the}} precipitation occurs. Frontogenesis occurs {{as a result of a}} developing baroclinic wave. According to Hoskins & Bretherton (1972, p. 11), there are eight mechanisms that influence temperature gradients: horizontal deformation, horizontal shearing, vertical deformation, differential vertical motion, latent heat <b>release,</b> <b>surface</b> friction, turbulence and mixing, and radiation. Semigeostrophic frontogenesis theory focuses on the role of horizontal deformation and shear.|$|E

40|$|Escherichia coli {{subjected}} to cold osmotic shock released 30 to 40 % of their fatty acid esters and 42 % of their cellular hexosamine. In contrast, Enterobacter, although they released 40 % of fatty acid esters, release only 25 % of hexosamine. Proteus released less than 15 % of either fatty acid esters or hexosamine. These differences {{are taken to}} explain the differences among the Enterobacteriaceae in <b>releasing</b> <b>surface</b> enzymes after osmotic shock.

40|$|Abstract. Five {{ground-based}} differential interferometric {{synthetic aperture}} radar (GB-DInSAR) surveys were con-ducted between 2005 and 2007 at the rock slope instability at Randa, Switzerland. Resultant displacement maps revealed, for the first time, {{the presence of an}} active basal rupture zone and a lateral <b>release</b> <b>surface</b> daylighting on the exposed 1991 failure scarp. Structures correlated with the boundaries of in-terferometric displacement domains were confirmed using a helicopter-based LiDAR DTM and oblique aerial photogra-phy. Former investigations at the site failed to conclusively detect these active release surfaces essential for kinematic and hazard analysis of the instability, although their existence had been hypothesized. The determination of the basal and lateral release planes also allowed a more accurate estimate of the currently unstable volume of 5. 7 ± 1. 5 million m 3. Th...|$|E
40|$|A Finite Element Method (FEM) is {{developed}} to calculate rotationally symmetric acoustic propagation over short range intervals (0 - 5 km) in shallow oceans (0 - 200 m deep) at low frequencies (0 - 50 Hz). The method allows full two-way wave propagation in range dependent environments and includes coupling {{to a full}} elastic seabed. Numerical results from a computer program are presented for propagation upslope, downslope, over seamounts and across trenches in the seabed. The seabed is modelled as a pressure <b>release</b> <b>surface,</b> a fluid halfspace and an elastic, solid halfspace {{and the implications of}} each type of model are discussed. The halfspaces, being represented by a new set of infinite elements, are modelled without truncation. The results are presented primarily as plots of transmission loss against range for a fixed depth receiver. Subsidiary results show the effect of depth averaging the receiver location, and extract mode amplitude data to reveal the strength of mode coupling and backscatter in different environments...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{concept of}} looping combustion/partial {{oxidation}} of carbon is presented. The underlying concept is {{the recognition of}} the feature of most carbons to extensively uptake oxygen upon exposure to air at moderate temperatures and to <b>release</b> <b>surface</b> oxides as carbon oxides (CO, CO 2) when the oxidized fuel is brought to moderate-to-high temperature in an oxygen-free atmosphere. On this basis, continuous or semicontinuous processes of carbon looping combustion can be envisaged which are based on proper combination of carbon oxidation (under air-blown operating conditions) and desorption (in oxygen-free atmosphere) steps. The resulting processes enable the generation of highly concentrated CO 2 effluents, much like conventional CLC processes. The soundness of the CarboLoop process is demonstrated by discontinuous experiments in which alternated oxidation (at 500 °C) and desorption (at 700 °C) steps were performed in a TG analyzer. Experiments were carried out using char from a bituminous coal. Carbon conversion degrees of about 50 % were obtained after three cycle...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbradable {{materials}} {{are used as}} inner coatings in aeronautical compressors. In the event of blade–casing interaction, the abradable coating accommodates the incursion of the blade tip {{in order to protect}} the blade and the casing from severe damage. In this study, an experiment was conducted in conditions representative of the full-scale situation in terms of velocity, temperature and the dynamical characteristics of blades. The mechanisms of incursion accommodation were investigated based on dynamical data and a post mortem analysis of the coating and the wear debris. First, dynamical blade tip incursion was estimated by considering blade vibrations and coating waviness. The tip incursion was found to be significantly different from the measured displacement of the blade foot. Next, a post mortem analysis of the coating was performed at the surface and sub-surface. Four mechanisms were identified, namely debris <b>release,</b> <b>surface</b> shearing, compaction and reversible deformation. Care was taken to provide orders of magnitude for the different mechanisms relating to residual thickness loss of the coating...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Electrospinning is a {{technique}} used to produce micron to submicron diameter polymeric fibers. The surface of electrospun fibers is important when considering end-use applications. For example, the ability to introduce porous surface features of a known size is required if nanoparticles need to be deposited {{on the surface of}} the fiber or if drug molecules are to be incorporated for controlled <b>release.</b> <b>Surface</b> features, or pores, became evident when electrospinning in an atmosphere with more than 30 % relative humidity. Increasing humidity causes an increase in the number, diameter, shape, and distribution of the pores. Increasing the molecular weight of the polystyrene (PS) results in larger, less uniform shaped pores. This work includes an investigation of how humidity and molecular weight affect the surface of electrospun PS fibers. The results of varying the humidity and molecular weight on the surface of electrospun PS fibers were studied using optical microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) coupled with image analysis...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe problem {{of determining the}} acoustic pressure in a wedge shaped wave guide is examined. Two computer models, one using the method of images, the other using coupled normal modes, are compared. This comparison is over the benchmark wedge of the Acoustic Society of America. Three scenarios were examined: isovelocity water over a pressure release bottom, isovelocity water over a penetrable, lossless bottom, and isovelocity water over a penetrable, lossy bottom. In all cases good agreement was seen between both models, with some differences due to a rigid subbottom in the normal mode model. The {{strengths and weaknesses of}} each model is examined. An analytic solution in normal modes of the waveguide with a pressure <b>release</b> <b>surface,</b> rigid bottom, and a discontinuous speed of sound profile is presented.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis work reports theoretical {{investigations of the}} surface motion in solids caused by reflection of an intense acoustic pulse at a pressure <b>release</b> <b>surface</b> done using the surface velocity reflection coefficient. A formula was derived for the surface velocity reflection coefficient which relates the surface particle velocity for an incident compression wave to the particle velocities of the incident and reflected waves. To obtain the surface profiles, two different assumptions were used. The first assumption was the conventional one. In this assumption, surface motion was neglected during the period that the pulse strikes the surface and {{it is called the}} fixed surface approximation. The second assumption is to consider the motion and distortions of the surface and is called the moving surface approximation. Four different materials were investigated and the results were compared for different materials and in the two different approximations. [URL] (Junior Grade), Turkish Nav...|$|E
