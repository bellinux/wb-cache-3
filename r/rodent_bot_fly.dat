50|$|The Cuterebrinae, {{the robust}} <b>bot</b> <b>flies,</b> are a {{subfamily}} of Oestridae which includes large, parasitic flies; {{this group has}} historically been treated as a family, but all recent classifications place them firmly within the Oestridae. Both genera spend their larval stages in the skin of mammals. The genus Cuterebra, or <b>rodent</b> <b>bots,</b> attack <b>rodents</b> and similar animals.

40|$|The {{energy and}} {{nutrient}} demands of parasites on their hosts are frequently invoked {{as an explanation}} for negative impacts of parasitism on host survival and reproductive success. Although cuterebrid <b>bot</b> <b>flies</b> are among the physically largest and most-studied insect parasites of mammals, the only study conducted on metabolic consequences of <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> parasitism revealed a surprisingly small effect of <b>bot</b> <b>flies</b> on host metabolism. Here we test the prediction that <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> parasitism increases the resting metabolic rate (RMR) of free-ranging eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus), particularly in juveniles who have not previously encountered parasites and have to allocate energy to growth. We found no effect of <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> parasitism on adults. In juveniles, however, we found that RMR strongly increased {{with the number of}} <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> larvae hosted. For a subset of 12 juveniles during a year where parasite prevalence was particularly high, we also compared the RMR before versus during the peak of <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> prevalence, allowing each individual to act as its own control. Each <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> larva resulted in a ~ 7. 6 % increase in the RMR of its host while reducing juvenile growth rates. Finally, <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> parasitism at the juvenile stage was positively correlated with adult stage RMR, suggesting persistent effects of <b>bot</b> <b>flies</b> on RMR. This study is the first to show an important effect of <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> parasitism on the metabolism and growth of a wild mammal. Our work highlights the importance of studying cost of parasitism over multiple years in natural settings, as negative effects on hosts are more likely to emerge in periods of high energetic demand (e. g. growing juveniles) and/or in harsh environmental conditions (e. g. low food availability) ...|$|R

40|$|Given the ubiquity and {{evolutionary}} importance of parasites, {{their effect on}} the energy budget of mammals remains surprisingly unclear. The eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus (L., 1758)) is a burrowing rodent that is commonly infected by cuterebrid <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> (Cuterebra emasculator Fitch, 1856) larvae. We measured resting metabolic rate (RMR) and cold-induced [Vo. sub. 2]-max (under heliox atmosphere) in 20 free-ranging individuals, of which 4 individuals were infected by one or two larva. We found that RMR was significantly higher in chipmunks infected by <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> larvae (mean [+ or -] SE = 0. 88 [+ or -] 0. 05 W) than in uninfected individuals (0. 74 [+ or -] 0. 02 W). In contrast, V[O. sub. 2]-max was significantly lower in chipmunks infected by <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> larvae (4. 96 [+ or -] 0. 70 W) than in uninfected individuals (6. 37 [+ or -] 0. 16 W). Consequently, the aerobic scope (ratio of [Vo. sub. 2]-max to RMR) was negatively correlated {{with the number of}} <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> larvae (infected individuals = 5. 74 [+ or -] 1. 03 W; noninfected individuals = 8. 67 [+ or -] 0. 26 W). Finally, after accounting for the effects of body mass and <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> parasitism on RMR and [Vo. sub. 2]-max, there was no correlation between the two variables among individuals within our population. In addition to providing the first estimate of [Vo. sub. 2]-max in T. striatus, these results offer additional evidence that <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> parasitism has significant impacts on the metabolic ecology of this host species...|$|R
40|$|<b>Bot</b> <b>flies</b> of {{the genus}} Cuterebra are {{restricted}} to the New World and are distributed {{throughout most of the}} temperate and tropical areas. Their larvae are obligatory parasites of mammals, producing myiasis in dermic and subdermic tissues of these animals (Catts 1982; Pape 2001). There is almost 70 species of Cuterebra and these flies {{are one of the most}} highly studied groups of insect parasites of New World wild mammals (Slansky 2007). However, the knowledge available on the ecology and natural history of most species comes from studies carried out in temperate regions (e. g. Wolf & Batzli 2001; Alcock & Kemp 2004; Jaffe et al. 2005). In the Neotropical region, the studies concerning the prevalence and dynamics of <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> larval parasitism in wild mammals are scarce and have been carried out mainly with rodents.

40|$|Abstract. An adult {{quarter horse}} mare was {{presented}} with acute colic and fever. Physical examination and abdominocentesis showed septic peritonitis, and the mare was euthanatized. Necropsy and histopathologic ex-amination revealed a focal partial perforation of the right ventral colon, which contained a single <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> larva, identified as a third-instar larva of Gasterophilus intestinalis. This larva was embedded deep within the mus-cularis and the submucosa. Although <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> larvae are known to attach to aberrant sites within the digestive tract, {{this is the first}} known report of deep penetration of the colon by a gasterophilus larva, with the resulting leakage of intestinal content leading to septic peritonitis. Key words: Aberrant migration; colic; Gasterophilus; horses; parasite; peritonitis. <b>Bot</b> <b>fly</b> larvae of the genus Gasterophilus commonly in-fect horses throughout the world. The second- and third-stage larvae are normally found attached to the mucosa of the stomach (typically, G. intestinalis), duodenum (G. na-salis, G. haemorrhoidalis), or rectum (G. haemorrhoidalis, G. inermis), where they cause focal superficial mucosal ul-ceration. 2 There is little evidence of significant advers...|$|R

Ophthalmomyiasis caused by Hypoderma spp. should {{be recognized as a}} potentially reversible cause of vision loss. Ophthalmomyiasis interna is invasion of the globe by larvae of any species of oestrid flies; ophthalmomyiasis externa involves only the external ocular structures (1). Dermatobia hominis, endemic to tropical or subtropical areas, and Oestrus ovis (sheep <b>bot</b> <b>fly)</b> cause most cases of ophthalmomyiasis (2). Both typically cause ophthalmomyiasis externa (2). Only 2 <b>bot</b> <b>flies</b> inhabit Nearctic circumpolar regions: the Caribou <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> (Hypoderma tarandi) and the Caribou nasal <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> (Cephenemyia trompe), a nonhuman pathogen (2). H. tarandi is a nonbiting fly whose obligate endoparasitic larvae typically affect caribou throughout their circumpolar range (2, 3). From late June to early September. the fly lays eggs directly on the guard hairs of the caribou (2, 3). Once deposited, eggs hatch into larvae that penetrate skin (3). They move subcutaneously to reach the animal’s dorsal region, where they cut breathing holes and are encased within granulomatous cysts, termed warbles. There they develop for 9 – 11 months; in May or June of the following year, they leave the animal and pupate on the ground (3). Mated adult females are capable of long flights (≈ 900 km) in search of suitable hosts (3). Infestations by H. tarandi in humans are rare but are likely underreported (4). Related species, H. bovis and H. lineatum, inhabit various regions of North America, Europe, and Asia and have also been implicated in human disease (2, 5). A third species that affects cattle and yaks in China (H. sinense) is also responsible for human infestations (2). The pathophysiology of human ophthalmomyiasi...|$|R

The many factors that can influence parasitic species composition (e. g. host and parasite genetics, relationships with their hosts and environment, and animal management) include the movement of domestic animals in association with migrating human populations in southern Europe over thousands of years. From its geographical position, which was strategically important in controlling commercial trade routes in early Western civilization, the Mediterranean sea has for more than 3000 years constituted the hub of many different cultures, populations, genes and agricultural practices.
