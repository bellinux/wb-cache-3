The software community, at that time, recognized the need for data and information about computer software, its development process and the software technology area in general. The rapid expanison of software engineering technology and the proliferation of tools and techniques made it difficult for an individual or organization to remain cognizant of the current status of the software engineering field. This situation resulted in the duplication of efforts in software research and seriously hampered the transfer of technology from the software <b>research</b> <b>environment</b> to the user sector of the software community.|$|E

500|$|Psilocybin {{has been}} a subject of medical {{research}} since the early 1960s, when Leary and Alpert ran the Harvard Psilocybin Project, in which they carried {{out a number of}} experiments to evaluate the therapeutic value of psilocybin in the treatment of personality disorders, or to augment psychological counseling. In the 2000s (decade), there was a renewal of research concerning the use of psychedelic drugs for potential clinical applications, such as to address anxiety disorders, major depression, and various addictions. In 2008, the Johns Hopkins research team published guidelines for responsibly conducting medical research trials with psilocybin and other hallucinogens in humans. These included recommendations on how to screen potential study volunteers to exclude those with personal or family psychiatric histories that suggest a risk of adverse reactions to hallucinogens. A 2010 study on the short- and long-term subjective effects of psilocybin administration in clinical settings concluded that despite a small risk of acute reactions such as dysphoria, anxiety, or panic, [...] "the administration of moderate doses of psilocybin to healthy, high-functioning and well-prepared subjects {{in the context of a}} carefully monitored <b>research</b> <b>environment</b> is associated with an acceptable level of risk"; the authors note, however, that the safety of the drug [...] "cannot be generalized to situations in which psilocybin is used recreationally or administered under less controlled conditions." ...|$|E

[...] The British built from scratch what became an expansive research facility at Porton Down, which remains a significant military research institution into the 21st century. [...] Unlike many earlier military-funded scientific ventures, the research at Porton Down did not stop when the war ended or an immediate goal was achieved. [...] In fact, every effort was made to create an attractive <b>research</b> <b>environment</b> for top scientists, and chemical weapons development continued apacethough in secretthrough the interwar years and into World War II.
