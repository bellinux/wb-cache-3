When calculating the regression model based on the Principal Component Regression (PCR), the selection of factors for calibration represents {{the most important and}} time consuming step. During this step relevant spectral information has to be separated from interfering artefacts, as e. g. noise, minority effects, etc. This is achieved by Genetic Algorithms (GAs), which are designed to find good solutions for this combinatoric optimization problem by making use of adaptive processes. Based on examples taken from typical application fields of NIR spectroscopy, the evaluation and optimization of calibrations is described in detail.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the possibility of}} period doubling transition to temporal chaos of a coherent structure in a finite dimensional Hamiltonian system with moderately small friction. A solitary wave in a periodically driven chain of particles provides a typical example. To this end the equations of motion are transformed to those of one driven dominant oscillator with one degree of freedom, weakly coupled {{to a set of}} oscillators representing the other degrees of freedom. The equations for the dominant oscillator alone confirm the possibility of such a transition to chaos for well chosen driving. However, taking into account coupling to the other degrees of freedom, one must conclude that the supposed infinite period doubling sequence for small or no dampling survives only in a heavily damaged state. In practice a <b>reproducable</b> completed sequence cannot be expected unless the damping is strong enough...|$|E

A comparison with a northern German specimen indicated low genetic variation also on an interpopulation level. Taking into account population histories (mass extinction, domestication, reintroductions) and the mating systems adopted, long-term effective population sizes in fallow deer should have been low, and low genetic variability could be expected.

40|$|Accepted for {{publication}} in Radiochimica ActaThe solubility of ThO 2 (cr) was studied since many years but a large discrepancy in solubility values is noticed in the literature. The present work suggests that this discrepancy is related to differences in the surface properties of thorium oxide. To understand the role of surface properties on solubility values, we conducted experiments with ThO 2 (cr) spheres with <b>reproducable</b> surface properties. Batch dissolution experiments were conducted in 0. 01 M NaCl solution at pH = 3. 0 and 4. 0 for periods of time up to 270 days. The solutions were spiked with 229 Th to determine precipitation (sorption) rates of thorium, while dissolution rates were determined by measuring 232 Th released from ThO 2 (cr) spheres. We assume that 229 Th atoms are exchanged only with active sites involved in Th-dissolution. Using 229 Th as local sensor of attachement and detachment processes at the ThO 2 (cr) surface under close-to-equilibrium conditions, allows to assess surface reactivity of the solid during solubility experiments...|$|E
