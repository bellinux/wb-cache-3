It consists of 16 QPDs, 16 signal processors for the QPDs, one laser diode, one analogue-to-digital converter, and one personal computer. In this paper, in order to reduce the noise of the QPDs, each QPD has individual signal processors. Calibration, stability test, and machine tool repeatability test have been performed.

40|$|Title of the paper: Accuracy of dual energy X-ray {{absorptiometry}} (DXA) for {{the determination}} of the body composition of pigs in vivo New methods for the measurement of the body composition in vivo (or post mortem) like DXA need to be evaluated before routine use in livestock research or performance testing. Two body weight groups of pigs I) 30 – 50 kg (n= 61) and II) 70 – 90 kg (n= 62) were studied in this analysis. The whole bodies of the pigs were analyzed by a GE Lunar DPX-IQ scanner in vivo for the amount and percentage of fat, lean tissue, bone mineral, and the bone mineral density as well. Three days later, pigs were slaughtered and after a 24 h cooling period, the <b>reference</b> <b>parts</b> (shoulder, loin, side, and ham) of the left carcass half were dissected into lean meat, fat, bone, tendons, connective tissue and skin according to the EU reference method. Generally, DXA variables explained a high proportion of variation (R²> 0. 8; √MSE= 70 – 784 g) in the tissue masses of the <b>reference</b> <b>parts</b> (fat, muscle, bone) in both weight groups. The fat percentage of the <b>reference</b> <b>parts</b> and the DXA whole body results (in vivo) showed a very high relationship with a maximum R²= 0. 82 (√MSE= 1. 47 %) for group II. Slightly lower was the relationship between the lean meat content (%) of the <b>reference</b> <b>parts</b> and DXA results in vivo (R 2 = 0. 72; √MSE= 1. 75) for group II. The bone percentage was predicted with R²= 0. 3 (√MSE= 0. 64), caused by the very different analysis methods. Generally, DXA is a suitable method for growth studies in the above body weight range. In order to predict the percentage of muscle (lean meat) or fat tissue accurately by DXA, pigs should weigh > 50 kg, since the soft tissue percentages of group I resulted in R²≤ 0. 38 (√MSE≤ 2. 55) ...|$|R
50|$|Capacitive {{displacement}} {{sensors can be}} used to {{make very}} precise thickness measurements. Capacitive displacement sensors operate by measuring changes in position. If the position of a <b>reference</b> <b>part</b> of known thickness is measured, other parts can be subsequently measured and the differences in position {{can be used to}} determine the thickness of these parts. In order for this to be effective using a single probe, the parts must be completely flat and measured on a perfectly flat surface. If the part to be measured has any curvature or deformity, or simply does not rest firmly against the flat surface, the distance between the part to be measured and the surface it is placed upon will be erroneously included in the thickness measurement. This error can be eliminated by using two capacitive sensors to measure a single part. Capacitive sensors are placed on either side of the part to be measured. By measuring the parts from both sides, curvature and deformities are taken into account in the measurement and their effects are not included in the thickness readings.|$|E
40|$|Driven by {{the high}} {{importance}} of resource efficiency the importance of lightweight construction rises across all industries. Due to their high lightweight construction potential, carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) are increasingly applied. But CFRP manufacturing often is an expensive small-scale production where {{it is necessary to}} use removable mold cores to manufacture hollow parts. To improve the complex process of mold core making future process chains including additive manufacturing (i. e. 3 D-printing) can be used. This paper provides a proposal for a hollow CFRP <b>reference</b> <b>part</b> based on facts taken directly from the field of application. The <b>reference</b> <b>part</b> will allow the evaluation of economic and ecological impact of process chains in mold core making for the CFRP production. Therefore, representative parts from different industry sectors were selected and analytically examined regarding their geometrical features. Based on a scientific recomposition of these features the <b>reference</b> <b>part</b> was developed...|$|E
40|$|A laser {{ultrasonic}} {{system is a}} non-contact inspection device with a long stand-off distance and it is applicable to hard-to-access locations such as in a nuclear power plant. In this paper, multiple surface waves generated by line-shaped multiple pulse laser beams are adopted to precisely detect a surface-breaking crack with its depth information. When a surface crack is positioned {{at the center of}} multiple pulse laser beams, acquired surface waves are composed of two parts, a <b>reference</b> <b>part</b> and a data part. The <b>reference</b> <b>part</b> is the front part of the acquired multiple surface waves and the data part is the rear part of the surface waves. Detail crack depth information can be extracted from the normalized multiple surface waves by using the <b>reference</b> <b>part.</b> The crack depth information is extracted by acquiring the difference between two peak frequencies of the reference and the data signal. Also, during a scanning test, we can elucidate a crack advent by observing the amplitude variation and frequency spectrum variation of the multiple surface waves when the crack is positioned in the range of the multiple pulse laser beams...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{diffusion}} of Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) was recently boosted by the expiration of the FDM patent {{and the subsequent}} worldwide development of low cost FDM machines by {{a huge number of}} small companies. In most of the cases, FDM machines are worth what they cost. Thus the performance of expensive industrial FDM systems is better than that of low cost machines, also known as 3 D printers. In this paper a benchmarking is carried out between a Dimension EliteTM by Stratasys and a 3 D TouchTM by Bits from Bytes (BFB). The study and comparison is based on a <b>reference</b> <b>part</b> that was designed to fit into the building volume of most of low cost FDM machines. The part includes several classic geometries (planes, cylinders, spheres and cones) of different sizes to cover several ranges of basic sizes as defined by the ISO 286 standard. Geometric features appear both in the concave and convex shapes to account for all design possibilities. The proposed <b>reference</b> <b>part</b> allows to consider a higher number of features for each range of basic sizes with respect to other benchmarking models presented in the literature. Moreover the part does not require support structures for its production, allowing for manufacturing on 3 D printers that come with a unique extruder. Replicas of the <b>reference</b> <b>part</b> are printed out of ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material with different layer thicknesses using the compared machines. After inspecting the replicas by means of a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM), the dimensional accuracy of the compared FDM systems is reported through part quality using IT grades associated with the ISO basic sizes.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{three different}} search engines {{for the detection}} of CAD-parts in large databases. The analysis of the contained information is performed by the export of the data that is stored in the structure trees of the CAD-models.

The first search engine is specializes in the discovery of standard parts, like screws or washers. The second program uses certain user input as search parameters, and therefore has the ability to perform personalized queries. The third one compares one given <b>reference</b> <b>part</b> with all parts in the database, and locates files that are identical, or similar to, the <b>reference</b> <b>part.</b> All approaches run automatically, and have the analysis of the structure tree in common.
