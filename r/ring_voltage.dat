50|$|Early {{crossbar}} exchanges {{were divided}} into an originating side and a terminating side, while the later and prominent Canadian and US SP1 switch and 5XB switch were not. When a user picked up the telephone handset, the resulting line loop operating the user's line relay caused the exchange to connect the user's telephone to an originating sender, which returned the user a dial tone. The sender then recorded the dialed digits and passed them to the originating marker, which selected an outgoing trunk and operated the various crossbar switch stages to connect the calling user to it. The originating marker then passed the trunk call completion requirements (type of pulsing, resistance of the trunk, etc.) and the called party's details to the sender and released. The sender then relayed this information to a terminating sender (which could be on either the same or a different exchange). This sender then used a terminating marker to connect the calling user, via the selected incoming trunk, to the called user, and caused the controlling relay set to pass intermittent <b>ring</b> <b>voltage</b> of about 90 V AC at 20 Hz to ring the called user's phone bell, and return ringing tone to the caller.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this note {{is to examine the}} {{likelihood}} and problems associated with operation of the Fermilab Booster rf systems as it presently exists, or with only minor modifications, at beam intensity approaching 5 x 10 {sup 13 } protons per pulse. Beam loading of the rf system at such an intensity will be one order of magnitude larger than at the present operation level. It is assumed that the injection energy will be raised to 1 GeV with no major increase in the injected energy spread (longitudinal emittance). The beam will be bunched by adiabatic capture as is presently done although {{it may be necessary to}} remove one or two bunches prior to acceleration to allow clean extraction at 8 GeV. At very high intensity the charge in each bunch will interact with the vacuum chamber impedance (and with itself) in such a way as to reduce in some cases the bucket area generated by the rf voltage.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the change in charge on a silicon MOS capacitor (MOS-C) subjected to a voltage step. The transient charge (Q-t) is controlled by the generation and recombination processes in the silicon.

A thorough experimental investigation of Q-t transients is given including the effects of the guard <b>ring</b> <b>voltage,</b> applied bias, voltage step magnitude, and voltage step polarity. The measurements were performed with an automated apparatus, using a micro computer controlled measuring system developed for the purpose.

The present Q-t method of determining lifetime is also compared to other Q-t analyses and with the C-t, C-V, and fast ramp methods. Good agreement is obtained with other Q-t and C-t methods, but not with the C-V and fast ramp methods.
