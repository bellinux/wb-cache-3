50|$|Natta {{first used}} {{polymerization}} catalysts based on titanium chlorides to polymerize propylene and other 1-alkenes. He discovered that these polymers are crystalline materials and ascribed their crystallinity {{to a special}} feature of the polymer structure called stereoregularity. The concept of stereoregularity in polymer chains is illustrated in {{the picture on the}} left with polypropylene. Stereoregular poly(1-alkene) can be isotactic or syndiotactic depending on the relative orientation of the alkyl groups in polymer chains consisting of units −CH2−CHR−, like the CH3 groups in the figure. In the isotactic polymers, all stereogenic centers CHR share the same configuration. The stereogenic centers in syndiotactic polymers alternate their <b>relative</b> <b>configuration.</b> A polymer that lacks any regular arrangement in the position of its alkyl substituents (R) is called atactic. Both isotactic and syndiotactic polypropylene are crystalline, whereas atactic polypropylene, which can also be prepared with special Ziegler-Natta catalysts, is amorphous. The stereoregularity of the polymer is determined by the catalyst used to prepare it.|$|E

Products with fused topology result.(6)Rearrangement after elimination of ditosylates has been observed; the chlorinated cycloheptadiene thus produced isomerizes to conjugated heptadiene 3 during the reaction.(7)Cyclopropanation with conjugated diazo compounds produces divinylcyclopropanes that then undergo rearrangement. When cyclic starting materials are used, bridged products result.(8)Substrates containing three-membered heterocyclic rings can also undergo the reaction. cis-Divinylepoxides give oxepines at elevated temperatures (100 °C). trans Isomers undergo an interesting competitive rearrangement to dihydrofurans through the intermediacy of a carbonyl ylide and the same ylide intermediate has been proposed as the direct precursor to the oxepine product 4. Conjugated dienyl epoxides form similar products, lending support {{to the existence of}} an ylide intermediate.(9)Divinyl aziridines undergo a similar suite of reactions providing azepines or vinyl pyrrolines depending on the <b>relative</b> <b>configuration</b> of the aziridine starting material.

5000|$|Terrestrial plants {{control the}} {{orientation}} of their primary growth through the sensing of several vectorial stimuli such as the light gradient or the gravitational acceleration. This control has been called tropism. However, a quantitative study of shoot gravitropism demonstrated that, when a plant is tilted, it cannot recover a steady erected posture under the sole driving of the sensing of its angular deflection versus gravity. An additional control through the continuous sensing of its curvature by the organ and the subsequent driving an active straightening process are required. [...] Being a sensing by the plant of the <b>relative</b> <b>configuration</b> of its parts, it has been called proprioception. This dual sensing and control by gravisensing and proprioception has been formalized into a unifying mathematical model simulating the complete driving of the gravitropic movement. This model has been validated on 11 species sampling the phylogeny of land angiosperms, and on organs of very contrasted sizes, ranging from the small germination of wheat (coleoptile) to the trunk of poplar trees. [...] This model also shows that the entire gravitropic dynamics is controlled by a single dimensionless number called the [...] "Balance Number", and defined as the ratio between the sensitivity to the inclination angle versus gravity and the proprioceptive sensitivity. This model has been extended {{to account for the}} effects of the passive bending of the organ under its self-weight, suggesting that proprioception is active even in very compliant stems, although {{they may not be able}} to efficiently straighten depending on their elastic deformation under the gravitational pull.Further studies have shown that the cellular mechanism of proprioception in plants involves myosin and actin, and seems to occur in specialized cells.
