In this way, the loss of crops is kept to a minimum, because only one or a few lines become susceptible to a pathogen within a given season, and all other crops are unaffected by the disease.

40|$|Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the most-widely {{cultivated}} {{and third}} most-produced grain crop in the world. Wheat contributes 19 % calories and 21 % protein {{of the global}} population diet. With an astounding increase in this global population, that is projected to reach 9 billion by 2050, demand for wheat {{is expected to reach}} 900 million tons by 2050. However, narrow genetic base and continued pressure from abiotic and biotic stresses pose a tough challenge to achieve the expected increase in grain yield. Research leading to the evolution of synthetic hexaploid wheat (Triticum durum x Aegilops tauschii) and synthetic derived wheat (SDW) (elite bread wheat X synthetic hexaploid wheat) provided a tremendous opportunity to improve wheat production. Preliminary studies showed that SDW had the potential to increase grain yield due to larger seed size and weight. However, heads per square meter and seeds per head are also major determinants of grain yield. Single seed weight was found to be highly heritable in SDW populations in our previous studies. Therefore, we hypothesized that indirectly selecting for heads per square meter and seeds per head, while maintaining single seed weight, will boost yield further. Multi location yield trials were conducted in 2013 and 2014 to determine grain yield and it?s components, morphological traits, resistance to green bug (Schizaphis graminum, Rond), leaf rust (Puccinia triticina), stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. Tritici), and powdery mildew (Erysiphe graminis f. sp. Tritici). We estimated quantitative genetic parameters including variance components, heritability, and genetic gain. In addition, we determined response to direct selection and correlated response to an indirect selection using heads per square meter and seeds per head as the indirect selection components. We further estimated the efficiency of indirect selection. Multi-location yield trials indicated certain SDW produced higher grain yield than their <b>recurrent</b> <b>parents</b> and common check varieties. Comparison of the top ten yielding SDW lines mean with the mean of <b>recurrent</b> <b>parents</b> showed SDW lines produced 11. 7 % higher grain yield than <b>recurrent</b> <b>parents.</b> The SDW lines maintained a similar number of seeds per head and heads per square meter as <b>recurrent</b> <b>parents</b> but had 10 % higher single seed weight. Also, SDW showed higher levels of leaf and stripe rust, greenbug, and powdery mildew resistance compared to their <b>recurrent</b> <b>parents.</b> There were certain indications to show that some resistance was transmitted from primary synthetics. Genetic analyses, such as the genotypic coefficient of variation, heritability, and genetic gain showed that there is tremendous scope for grain yield improvement by utilizing SDW. Genetic gain results indicated that grain yield can be improved by 15. 6 % per cycle at 10 % selection intensity (i = 1. 76). The efficiency of indirect selection for yield, using heads per meter square, was only 0. 41. Similarly, seeds per head and single seed weight had an efficiency of 0. 46 and 0. 21, respectively. These results indicate that SDW contributed some favorable alleles for yield, biotic stress resistance, and abiotic stress tolerance. These results also showed that SDW contributions were advantageous under both rainfed and irrigated conditions, which makes them an invaluable source for increasing genetic diversity and improving performance of Texas A&M AgriLife wheat germplasm...|$|R

30|$|Yield and agro-morphologic data of 20 pyramided two parental lines {{revealed}} that the pyramided lines possessed excellent features of <b>recurrent</b> <b>parent</b> and also yielding ability with tolerance to bacterial blight resistance. This indicates that some pyramid lines {{are very close to}} the <b>recurrent</b> <b>parent</b> and some are even better than the <b>recurrent</b> <b>parent</b> with respect to yield. The higher yield of the pyramided lines may be due to inheritance of some yield traits or QTLs of mega variety (Swarna BB pyramid) used here as the donor parent, besides the <b>recurrent</b> <b>parent</b> Jalmagna to the pyramided line. The complete recovery of the yield and grain quality characters of Jalmagna along with transfer of three BB resistance genes of CRMAS 2232 â 85 is a very significant achievement. This is particularly so because yield and agro-morphologic traits is multigenic traits encoded by loci that are distributed across the rice genome. The traits recovery of Jalmagna was due to integration of many polymorphic markers in the backcross breeding program. As per our analysis, we find that there is a variation from the theoretically expected 75 % contribution from the <b>recurrent</b> <b>parent</b> genome to the BC 1 F 1 plants. All the selected BC 1 F 1 plants had a <b>recurrent</b> <b>parent</b> genome contribution more than the expected 75 %.

40|$|Two {{populations of}} {{interspecific}} introgression lines (ILs) {{in a common}} <b>recurrent</b> <b>parent</b> were developed for use in pre-breeding and QTL mapping. The ILs were derived from crosses between cv Curinga, a tropical japonica upland cultivar, and two different wild donors, Oryza meridionalis Ng. accession (W 2112) and Oryza rufipogon Griff. accession (IRGC 105491). The lines were genotyped using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) and SSRs. The 32 Curinga/O. meridionalis ILs contain 76. 73 % of the donor genome in individual introgressed segments, and each line has an average of 94. 9 % <b>recurrent</b> <b>parent</b> genome. The 48 Curinga/O. rufipogon ILs collectively contain 97. 6 % of the donor genome {{with an average of}} 89. 9 % <b>recurrent</b> <b>parent</b> genome per line. To confirm that these populations were segregating for traits of interest, they were phenotyped for pericarp color in the greenhouse and for four agronomic traits-days to flowering, plant height, number of tillers, and number of panicles-in an upland field environment. Seeds from these IL libraries and the accompanying GBS datasets are publicly available and represent valuable genetic resources for exploring the genetics and breeding potential of rice wild relatives.

30|$|Currently, {{over two}} dozen CSSL or BIL {{libraries}} in rice {{are being developed}} at different research institutions around the world (TableÂ  2). As a collaboration between the University of Arizona, United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS), and the University of Arkansas, it is anticipated that four BIL libraries will be developed using both O. glaberrima and O. barthii donors and two US rice cultivars, LaGrue, a long-grain tropical japonica adapted to the southern region of the USA and M- 202, a medium grain temperate japonica adapted to California, as <b>recurrent</b> <b>parents</b> (TableÂ  2; Eizenga and Sanchez, personal communication). At USDA-ARS, Stuttgart, AR, under the RiceCAP program, three BILs libraries are being developed using O. nivara and O. meridionalis as donors and two US tropical japonica cultivars, Bengal and Lemont as recipient parents {{with a view to}} map sheath blight and blast resistance genes (TableÂ  2; Eizenga, personal communication).|$|R
40|$|The {{segregation}} of self-compatibility from L. temulentum was examined in backcross generations derived from hybrids between this species and the self-incompatible species, L. perenne and L. multiflorum, {{the latter being}} used as <b>recurrent</b> <b>parents.</b> Segregation patterns for self-compatibility were determined by percentage self seed set and by in-vitro self-pollination scores in the resulting backcross generations. Self-compatibility in L. temulentum is controlled in a gametophytic manner by a single gene mutation of either the Z locus or a locus tightly linked to it. Self-compatibility can be fixed in the homozygous form (i. e. 100 per cent pollen-tube growth on selfed stigmas) by selfing half compatible backcross plants. The S locus is still present in L. temulentum and functions when combined with a functional Z locus derived from either L. perenne or L. multiflorum. This has evolutionary significance for {{the relationship of the}} self-compatible and -incompatible Lolium species. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|A lot {{of plant}} {{materials}} {{are needed for}} successful back cross program of interspecific FI rice to their <b>recurrent</b> <b>parents.</b> Multiplication of the steril FI plants through tiller propagation is not adequate. The research aims to develop technique of vegetatif multiplication of interspesific hybrid rice utilizing nodal segments. In the vegetatif multiplication experiment, several factors were examined as treatments: nutrition culture (MS, Yoshida, and water), stum position (first, second and third) and growth media (vermiculite, husk charcoal, and sand). The plant materials are interspecific FI rice i. e. Ranah Sanra (genom AA) x O. officinalis 100870 (genom CC), Hawara Bunar (genom AA) x O. Punctata 9101411 (genom BB), Grogol (genom AA) x O. punctata 9101411 (genom BB), CT 6510 - 24 - 1 - 3 (genom AA) x O. malamphuzaensis 100957 (genom BBCC). Results of the study indicated that MS and Yoshida nutrition, stum without sheath, base of stum and sand media gave better growth more than other treatments...|$|R
