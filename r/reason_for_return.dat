Using an empirical study of Sichuan and Anhui provinces, we analyze the selectivity of return migrants and their reasons for return, focusing not only on how returnees compare with continuing migrants, but also on their decisionmaking. The analysis indicates that returnees are negatively selected among migrants and suggests that failure migrants are more prevalent than are typically portrayed in the literature. The results also highlight family demand as an important <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>return.</b> These findings suggest that migrants’ institutional and social inferiority in the city undermines their likelihood to succeed in the destination and reinforces their desire to return when family needs arise.

40|$|Objective: The {{number of}} {{pharmaceutical}} items issued on prescription is continually rising {{and contributing to}} spiralling healthcare costs. Although there is some data highlighting the quantity, in terms of weight of medicines returned specifically to community pharmacies, {{little is known about}} the specific details of such returns or other destinations for wasted medications. This pilot study has been designed to investigate the types and amounts of medicines returned to both general practices (GPs) and associated local community pharmacies determining the reasons why these medicines have been returned. Method: The study was conducted in eight community pharmacies and five GP surgeries within East Birmingham over a 4 -week period. Main outcome Measure: <b>Reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>return</b> and details of returned medication. Results: A total of 114 returns were made during the study: 24 (21. 1) to GP surgeries and 90 (78. 9) to community pharmacies. The total returns comprised 340 items, of which 42 (12. 4) were returned to GPs and 298 (87. 6) to pharmacies, with the mean number of items per return being 1. 8 and 3. 3, respectively. Half of the returns in the study were attributed to the doctor changing or stopping the medicine; 23. 7 of returns were recorded as excess supplies or clearout often associated with patients' death and 3. 5 of returns were related to adverse drug reactions. Cardiovascular drugs were most commonly returned, amounting to 28. 5 of the total drugs returned during the study. Conclusions: The results from this pilot study indicate that unused medicines impose a significant financial burden on the National Health Service as well as a social burden on the United Kingdom population.

The cohort comprised 168 patients aged 18 - 64 years who were working prior to the injury and sustained a range of acute unintentional orthopaedic injuries resulting in hospitalization. Baseline data was obtained by survey and medical record review. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression {{analysis was used to}} examine the association between potential predictors and {{the duration of}} time away from work during the six month study. The study achieved 89 % follow-up. Results Of the 168 participants recruited to the study, 68 % returned to work during the six month study. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis identified that blue collar work, negative pain attitudes with respect to work, high initial pain intensity, injury severity, older age, initial need for surgery, the presence of co-morbid health conditions at study entry and an orthopaedic injury to more than one region were associated with extended duration away from work following the injury.

40|$|Introduction: Although {{there are}} {{approximately}} 1. 1 million case presentations of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in the emergency department (ED) each year, little data is available to clinicians to identify patients {{who are at risk}} for poor outcomes, including 72 -hour ED return after discharge. An understanding of patients at risk for ED return visits during the hyperacute phase following head injury would allow ED providers to develop clinical interventions that reduce its occurrence and improve outcomes. Methods: This institutional review board-approved consecutive cohort study collected injury and outcome variables on adults with the purpose of identifying positive predictors for 72 -hour ED return visits in mTBI patients. Results: Of 2, 787 mTBI patients, 145 (5 %) returned unexpectedly to the ED within 72 hours of hospital discharge. Positive predictors for ED return visits included being male (p= 0. 0298), being black (p= 0. 0456), having a lower prehospital Glasgow Coma Score (p= 0. 0335), suffering the injury due to a motor vehicle collision (p= 0. 0065), or having a bleed on head computed tomography (CT) (p= 0. 0334). ED return visits were not significantly associated with age, fracture on head CT, or symptomology following head trauma. Patients with return visits most commonly reported post-concussion syndrome (43. 1 %), pain (18. 7 %), and recall for further clinical evaluation (14. 6 %) as the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>return.</b> Of the 124 patients who returned to the ED within 72 hours, one out of five were admitted to the hospital for further care, with five requiring intensive care unit stays and four undergoing neurosurgery. Conclusion: Approximately 5 % of adult patients who present to the ED for mTBI will return within 72 hours of discharge for further care. Clinicians should identify at-risk individuals during their initial visits and attempt to provide anticipatory guidance when possible. [West J Emerg Med. 2015; 16 (2) : 481 – 485. ...|$|E

40|$|The returns {{management}} (RM) {{process has}} traditionally {{been seen as a}} value recovery process, which has resulted in an efficiency focus in the returns flow. This thesis present, the effects on a fashion e-commerce organisation, which is underprioritising or neglecting RM in general and consumer returns specifically. In the reported and described single-case study and through a real-life experiment, performed with the case organisation nelly. com, it is shown that the consumer returns rates are not only influenced by the product itself. They represent a complex problem that has its reasons and causes, whereby the product (size, fit, quality, et cetera) together with consumer buying and returning behaviour ultimately have a combined effect on the organisation. The results from the thesis are based on previous research and rest heavily on the research performed {{since the start of the}} research journey. Consumer returns form part of the value creation in e-commerce and therefore returns management is a strategic part of the business as such. Handling consumer returns in a traditional or efficient returns system without knowing the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>return</b> and the state of the returned item is nothing other than gambling with resources. The proposed returns information system (RIS) framework in the thesis addresses this issue and facilitates the downstream application of the gatekeeping activity, near or at the end-user location; managerial attention is required at the strategic process level to build a proper returns system that is partly, and quite likely, decentralised. Products, suppliers, customers and internal processes cause consumer returns and therefore a returns manager needs to address these with other functions and SC partners. This result is partly new and the proposed alignment of RM as a strategic process is new in the sense that RM is part of value creation. This thesis empirically supports the conclusion that “one size fits all” is outdated and does not fit with ecommerce business. The results imply that managers need to gain a profound understanding of consumers’ buying behaviour and also to create differentiated delivery and returns processes to be able to grow within the existing customer segments and possibly to attract new or non-customers who are out of reach at present. Seeing the RM process as strategic in e-commerce, as proposed in the thesis, facilitates the development of the process to become both effective and efficient. Returns management has the potential for revenue creation and cost reduction.

40|$|The 1965 Immigration Act {{released}} {{a stream of}} immigration from Asia and Latin America that continues to shape the U. S. population composition. While some of these migrants promptly returned to their countries of origin, many spent {{many years in the}} U. S. and face retirement with truncated work histories, legal impediments to old-age support programs, and social networks scattered in two countries. This dissertation examines one issue in the aging process for Latin American immigrants, namely the location of their retirement. I examine the extent to which older immigrants return to their home countries during later life and whether retirement income plays a role in this decision. A daunting challenge in studying this topic is data limitations. The migration literature notes numerous inconsistencies across data sources due to their different strengths and limitations. To address this issue, I do an in-depth examination of the magnitude and characteristics of return migration among older Mexican immigrants using multiple data sources to assess the consistency of the outcomes. In chapter 2, I discuss the rate of return migration among Mexican immigrants aged 50 years and their characteristics compared to their U. S. -residing counterparts using the Integrated Public-Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) for Mexico, the National Survey of Demographic Dynamics (ENADID), and the Mexican Health and Aging Survey (MHAS). I find that the five-year incidence of return migration from the U. S. to Mexico ranges from two percent when generated using IPUMS Mexico to six percent when using the MHAS. However, while the rate of return migration among this population is inconsistent across data sources, certain characteristics are not. All data sources suggest that return migrants are predominantly male and have intermediary levels of education. Characteristics that are inconsistent across data sources are marital, employment, and citizenship status. Aside from the magnitude and characteristics of return migration, Ialso examine one possible <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>return</b> migration during laterlife, namely higher levels of retirement income. Mexicans withgreater retirement benefits may view this income stream as a meanstoward greater luxury in the home country. Conversely, these migrantsmay return migrate only upon concluding that they cannot make endsmeet in the U. S. Each scenario has vastly different implications forthe U. S. economy. I examine this question in two chapters in orderto take advantage of two forms of data: survey and administrativedata. Pooling IPUMS U. S. A. and IPUMS Mexico, I conduct logisticregressions to determine if higher levels of retirement income areassociated with an increased probability of return migration. I alsodo a sensitivity analysis to assess possible biases associated withpooling two data sources. Results from this chapter suggest thatMexican immigrants with lower levels of retirement income are morelikely to return to their home country during later life than thosewith higher levels of retirement income. This pattern holds assumingvarious rates of Hispanic undercount. However, in the absence of anatural experiment, one cannot attach a causal interpretation to the results of this chapter. The experimental nature of chapter 4 does enable a causalinterpretation. In chapter 4, I use a natural experiment whereby theSocial Security Administration substantially lowered the SocialSecurity benefits of the 1917 - 1921 birth cohorts due to a mistake intheir benefit calculation formula. These birth cohorts have sincebeen referred to as the ``notch" generation as graphs depictingaverage benefit amounts by birth cohort show a visible notch for thisgroup. In chapter 4, I use this natural source of exogeneity toobserve whether the ``notch" generation was more likely to returnmigrate {{than those who did not}} receive these lower benefits. Resultsof this chapter indicate that Social Security benefits do not affectthe probability of return migration for Latin American primary SocialSecurity beneficiaries...|$|E
