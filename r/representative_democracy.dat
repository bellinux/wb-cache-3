5|$|Following the Constitution of India, Uttarakhand, {{like all}} Indian states, has a {{parliamentary}} system of <b>representative</b> <b>democracy</b> for its government.|$|E
5|$|<b>Representative</b> <b>democracy</b> {{began in}} the 1940s {{when the number of}} elected seats in the {{legislature}} gradually increased, until a fully elected Legislative Assembly of Singapore was established in 1958. At present, Singapore legislation establishes various mechanisms that fulfil the doctrine of <b>representative</b> <b>democracy.</b> Parliamentary elections in Singapore are required to be held regularly to elect the Parliament through universal suffrage. Although the right to vote in Singapore law is not expressly mentioned in the Constitution, the Government has affirmed that the right may be implied into the constitutional text.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution further {{provides}} for the composition of a parliament which encompasses members of parliament (MPs) elected through Single Member Constituencies and Group Representation Constituencies, Non-constituency Members of Parliament (NCMPs) and Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs). MPs are representatives of the electorate and have the role of raising concerns that the people may have. The Government's view is that <b>representative</b> <b>democracy</b> is better understood as regarding political parties rather than individual MPs as the fundamental element in the political system. While the judiciary is not a direct manifestation {{of the concept of}} <b>representative</b> <b>democracy,</b> it serves as a check on the Government and the legislature by ensuring that their powers are exercised within the limits established by the Constitution, such as the fundamental liberties in Part IV.|$|E

50|$|Direct {{democracy}} (also {{known as}} pure democracy) {{is a form}} of democracy in which people decide (e.g. vote on, form consensus on) policy initiatives directly. This differs from the majority of modern <b>democracies,</b> which are <b>representative</b> <b>democracies.</b>|$|R
5|$|Thio {{also argued}} that without a constitutionally {{expressed}} right to vote, the judiciary is handicapped in interpreting this implied right, given its conservative approach to reading the Constitution {{and the fact that}} it is unlikely to appeal to normative ideas such as <b>representative</b> <b>democracy.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, {{potentially}} severe {{restrictions on}} free speech, {{some of which}} are elaborated upon below, may act as a disincentive to people expressing political views. These restrictions inevitably have a bearing on how <b>representative</b> <b>democracy</b> is upheld, and have also been said to impact the content of free speech as opposition parties are tempered by the fear of defamation suits.|$|E
5|$|Possible reforms {{might be}} for {{prospective}} candidates {{to have the right}} to publicly respond to negative accusations before the PEC, and for the PEC to be more transparent with regard to the reasons for their decisions concerning the eligibility of candidates. A more democratized process open to public scrutiny would give citizens a role to play, thus enhancing the notion of <b>representative</b> <b>democracy.</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we analyse {{the problem of}} vote {{swapping}} in <b>representative</b> <b>democracies.</b> Vote swapping consists of exchanging votes between two voters from two different jurisdictions in order to beat a candidate that both voters dislike. The recent debates and legal disputes about this manipulation device raise some important ethical issues. We adopt an axiomatic approach, first establishing the relationship between vote swapping and a restricted form of gerrymandering, which {{is another way of}} manipulating elections in <b>representative</b> <b>democracies.</b> We then look for voting rules that are immune to such manipulations and show that any such voting rules only exist if either the voters or the candidates are given unreasonable powe...|$|R
50|$|In {{the public}} sector of {{countries}} constituted as <b>representative</b> <b>democracies,</b> voters elect politicians to public office. Such politicians hire many managers and administrators, and in some countries like the United States political appointees lose their jobs on {{the election of a}} new president/governor/mayor.|$|R
50|$|Modern <b>representative</b> <b>democracies</b> {{attempt to}} bridge the gulf between the Hobbesian 'state of nature' and the grip of {{authoritarianism}} through 'social contracts' that enshrine {{the rights of the}} citizens, curtail the power of the state, and grant agency through the right to vote.|$|R
5|$|Singapore was colonized by the British in the 19th century, {{during which}} society was ruled {{according}} to English law. The {{result was the}} transplantation of the Western idea of <b>representative</b> <b>democracy</b> into Singapore's legal system. This idea has taken root and developed tremendously {{since the end of}} World War II into what it is today.|$|E
5|$|The Legislature of Singapore {{consists}} of the President and the Parliament. The concept of <b>representative</b> <b>democracy</b> is embodied in the Legislature and is given effect in part through various parliamentary innovations that have been introduced over the years, such as Group Representation Constituencies, Non-constituency Members of Parliament and Nominated Members of Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Voting is {{regarded}} as key to <b>representative</b> <b>democracy,</b> which requires that the leaders of a country are elected by the people. The basis of this concept is that everyone should be treated equally and everyone has equal rights. Every person, therefore, {{has a right to}} one vote, and no more, in the choice of representatives. The right to vote is a primary right, a right of fundamental importance by which other rights are protected. It is one of the important bulwarks of a <b>representative</b> <b>democracy</b> and in this regard, the ballot box is the people's ultimate mechanism to control the shaping of government policies. However, it must be recognized that voting is not an infallible litmus test for democracy; rather, it functions as a procedural device that is normally regarded as the best instrument for securing the ideal of self-governance.|$|E
50|$|The {{vision is}} {{critical}} of aspects of modern <b>representative</b> <b>democracies</b> arguing {{that the level of}} political control by the people isn't sufficient. To address this problem parpolity suggests a system of Nested Councils, which would include every adult member of a given society.|$|R
5000|$|In his Lectures, Tytler {{displayed}} a cynical view {{of democracy in}} general and <b>representative</b> <b>democracies</b> such as republics in particular. He believed that [...] "a pure democracy is a chimera", and that [...] "All government is essentially {{of the nature of}} a monarchy".|$|R
50|$|In many <b>representative</b> <b>democracies,</b> {{party leaders}} compete {{directly}} for high political office. It is thus typical in such states (e.g., in the Westminster system) {{for the party}} leader to seek election to the legislature, and, if elected, to simultaneously serve as the party's parliamentary leader.|$|R
5|$|Constitutionally, Turkey is a {{parliamentary}} <b>representative</b> <b>democracy.</b> Since its foundation as a republic in 1923, Turkey {{has developed a}} strong tradition of secularism. Turkey's constitution governs the legal framework of the country. It sets out the main principles of government and establishes Turkey as a unitary centralised state. The President of the Republic {{is the head of}} state and has a largely ceremonial role. The president is elected for a five-year term by direct elections and Tayyip Erdoğan is the first president elected by direct voting.|$|E
5|$|He {{was known}} for his support of <b>representative</b> <b>democracy</b> and his populist style. For example, he would hold town halls and let {{constituents}} vote on motions to decide what he would do in Congress on their behalf and these meetings helped Bedell understand the problems of his constituents; as a result, he backed issues that were important to his farming constituency, such as waterway usage fees and production constraints.|$|E
5|$|Singapore has a multi-party {{parliamentary}} system of <b>representative</b> <b>democracy</b> {{in which the}} President of Singapore {{is the head of}} state and the Prime Minister of Singapore is the head of government. Executive power is vested in the President and the Cabinet. Cabinet has the general direction and control of the government and is collectively responsible to the Parliament. There are three separate branches of government: the legislature, executive and judiciary.|$|E

50|$|Allende {{is often}} cited in non-academic discussions about whether a 'communist' {{government}} has ever been democratically elected. While Allende legitimately won a democratic election, {{the significance of this}} has been disputed by some because he only had a plurality, not a majority, in the popular vote. This voting pattern is not unknown in <b>representative</b> <b>democracies.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Constitution vests {{the three}} {{branches}} of the state with different aspects of governmental power. The executive {{is made up of}} the President and the Cabinet, which is headed by the Prime Minister. The Cabinet is accountable to the electorate and is an embodiment of <b>representative</b> <b>democracy.</b> The President is elected by the people to act as a constitutional safeguard in protecting the national reserves and preserving the integrity of the public service. To qualify as a presidential candidate, stringent criteria must be satisfied.|$|E
5|$|Upholding {{the concept}} of <b>representative</b> <b>democracy</b> {{requires}} the protection of freedom of expression. This paves the way for discussion {{of the state of}} affairs in the country, as expressed by representatives of the people, which include members of the ruling party elected into government as well as opposition politicians. Free discourse about political ideas and government plans can facilitate the acknowledgement of current weaknesses or limitations. This is justified in the name of public interest as the legislature, administration and governmental institutions will then strive to make improvements.|$|E
5|$|Wotton contested the {{constitutionality}} of Queensland's parole conditions to the High Court of Australia. The Australian constitution contains an implied freedom of political communication, as is necessary in a <b>representative</b> <b>democracy,</b> plus rights to freedom of association and assembly. The case was heard by the High Court in August 2010, where Wotton was represented {{by a team of}} lawyers including Levitt Robinson Solicitors, Ron Merkel QC, assisted by Kristen Walker, Alistair Pound and Ben Schokman.|$|E
50|$|One {{school of}} scholarship, based {{mainly in the}} United States, {{considers}} mixed government to be the central characteristic of a republic, and holds that the U.S. has rule by the one (the President) (monarchy), the few (the Senate, which was originally supposed to represent the States) (aristocracy), and the many (House of <b>Representatives)</b> (<b>democracy).</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{universal}} use {{of elections}} {{as a tool}} for selecting representatives in modern <b>representative</b> <b>democracies</b> is in contrast with the practice in the democratic archetype, ancient Athens, where the Elections were considered an oligarchic institution and most political offices were filled using sortition, also known as allotment, by which officeholders were chosen by lot.|$|R
40|$|In <b>representative</b> <b>democracies,</b> {{citizens}} and politicians are coupled by a double link: citizens elect politicians to govern and {{to represent them}} in deliberative assemblies (local, regional and national parliaments); governments and parliaments make decisions (in the name of those they represent) and citizens have to then comply with these decisions. Traditionally, the communication channel is basicall...|$|R
5|$|Result {{from the}} {{expansion}} of the British Empire, British cultural influence can be observed in the language and culture of a geographically wide assortment of countries such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, the United States, and the British overseas territories. These states are sometimes collectively known as the Anglosphere. As well as the British influence on its empire, the empire also influenced British culture, particularly British cuisine. Innovations and movements within the wider-culture of Europe have also changed the United Kingdom; Humanism, Protestantism, and <b>representative</b> <b>democracy</b> have developed from broader Western culture.|$|E
5|$|The General Court, as the {{legislative}} and judicial bodies, and the Governor, {{as the chief}} executive of the colony, constituted a political system of division of power. It followed a recommendation in John Calvin's political theory to set up several institutions which complement and control each other in a system of checks and balances in order to minimize the misuse of political power. In 1625, the settlers had repaid their debts and thus gained complete possession of the colony. The colony was de facto a republic, since neither an English company nor the King and Parliament exerted any influence—a <b>representative</b> <b>democracy</b> governed on the principles of the Mayflower Compact ("self-rule").|$|E
5|$|The NMP {{scheme was}} not {{introduced}} without controversy, which may {{lead one to}} question {{the effectiveness of the}} scheme in strengthening <b>representative</b> <b>democracy.</b> Despite the protests of many PAP MPs, the party whip was enforced to effect the passing of this scheme. Criticism of the scheme mainly revolved around the dilution of the democratic legitimacy of the Parliament since the electorate has no say in choosing the NMP based on his or her merits. Further, there may be doubts as to the NMP's commitment and willingness to serve as an MP, since the NMP bypasses the electoral process. The scheme has also given rise to allegations that it serves as another platform for the PAP to undercut support for the opposition.|$|E

50|$|In prosperous western <b>representative</b> <b>democracies,</b> {{the poor}} form a {{minority}} of the population, and may not have the power to use the state to initiate redistribution when a majority of the electorate opposes such designs.

50|$|In politics, {{representation}} {{describes how}} some individuals {{stand in for}} others {{or a group of}} others, for a certain time period. Representation usually refers to <b>representative</b> <b>democracies,</b> where elected officials nominally speak for their constituents in the legislature. Generally, only citizens are granted representation in the government in the form of voting rights; however, some democracies have extended this right further.|$|R
