5|$|In an {{interview}} with Fortune magazine, Activision's CEO of Publishing Eric Hirshberg found that even after five years without a game, the Guitar Hero brand still enjoyed high social media attention, with over 10 million followers on the Guitar Heros Facebook page. However, Hirshberg stated that Activision realized they needed to <b>reinvent</b> <b>the</b> series so that consumers would not consider it {{much the same as}} previous games and to help sway those that were turned off by the earlier saturation of music games.|$|E
5|$|Paramount {{turned down}} several {{proposals}} in the mid-2000s {{to restart the}} franchise. These included pitches from film director Bryan Singer, Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski, and Trek actors Jonathan Frakes and William Shatner. The studio also turned down an animated web series. Instead, Paramount hired a new creative team to reinvigorate the franchise in 2007. Writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman and Lost producer, J. J. Abrams, had the freedom to <b>reinvent</b> <b>the</b> feel of Trek.|$|E

5|$|The World Without Us applies a more {{ecological}} view to Earth Abides. Before writing it, the author, Alan Weisman, {{had written}} four books, including, Gaviotas: A Village to <b>Reinvent</b> <b>the</b> World, in 1998, about the eco-village of Gaviotas in Colombia; and An Echo In My Blood, in 1999, about his family's history immigrating from Ukraine to the United States. He {{has worked as}} an international journalist for American magazines and newspapers, {{and at the time}} of writing the book was an Associate Professor of Journalism and Latin American Studies at the University of Arizona. The position required him to teach only one class in the spring semester, and he was free to travel and conduct research the rest of the year.|$|E
5|$|The next title, Tomb Raider Chronicles, {{depicted}} the late Lara Croft via her friends' flashbacks. The game introduced stealth attacks, which would {{carry over to}} the next game, Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness. While the original development team worked on Chronicles, Core Design assigned a new team to develop Angel of Darkness for the PlayStation 2. Anticipating innovative changes from next generation consoles, Adrian Smith—co-founder of Core Design—wanted to <b>reinvent</b> <b>the</b> character {{to keep pace with}} the updated technology. Core Design conducted market research, including fan polls, to aid in Angel of Darknesss development. The development team felt it could not alter the character and instead opted to place her in a situation different from previous games. The PlayStation 2 hardware allowed for more manoeuvres and a more detailed character model; the number of polygons in Croft's model increased to 4,400. The team sought to add more melee manoeuvres to better match Lara Croft's portrayal as an expert fighter in her backstory. Movement control was switched from the directional pad to the analogue control stick to provide more precision. After the original team finished Chronicles, it joined the development of Angel of Darkness. Excess content, missed production deadlines, and Eidos's desire to time the game's launch to coincide with the release of the 2003 Tomb Raider film resulted in a poorly designed game; Croft was brought back to life without explanation and the character controls lacked precision.|$|E

25|$|On October 5, 2011, Steve Jobs died, {{marking the}} end of an era for Apple. The first major product {{announcement}} by Apple following Jobs's passing occurred on January 19, 2012, when Apple's Phil Schiller introduced iBooks Textbooks for iOS and iBook Author for Mac OS X in New York City.

25|$|In 1898, German Emperor Wilhelm II visited Saladin's tomb {{to pay his}} respects. The visit, {{coupled with}} anti-imperialist sentiments, led {{nationalist}} Arabs to <b>reinvent</b> <b>the</b> image of Saladin and portray him as a hero of the struggle against the West. The image of Saladin they used was the romantic one created by Walter Scott and other Europeans in the West at the time, conveniently ignoring Saladin's Kurdish ethnicity. It replaced Saladin's reputation as a figure who had been largely forgotten in the Muslim world, eclipsed by more successful figures, such as Baybars of Egypt.|$|E

25|$|In Japan 2 {{business}} schools offer the accredited MBA degree (AACSB, AMBA or EQUIS). The {{concept of an}} MBA is still not considered mainstream as traditional companies still perceive that knowledge and learning with respect to business and management can only be effectively gained through experience and not within a classroom. In fact, some companies {{have been known to}} place recent MBA recipients in unrelated fields, or try to re-acclimate their Japanese employees who have spent years overseas earning the degree. As a consequence, academic institutions in Japan are attempting to <b>reinvent</b> <b>the</b> perception of the MBA degree, by taking into account the local corporate culture.|$|E
25|$|A Fistful of Dollars was {{at first}} {{intended}} by Leone to <b>reinvent</b> <b>the</b> western genre in Italy. In his opinion, the American westerns of the mid- to late-1950s had become stagnant, overly preachy and not believable. Despite {{the fact that even}} Hollywood began to gear down production of such films, Leone knew that there was still a significant market in Europe for westerns. He observed that Italian audiences laughed at the stock conventions of both American westerns and the pastiche work of Italian directors working behind pseudonyms. His approach was to take the grammar of Italian film and to transpose it into a western setting.|$|E
25|$|The Providencia Avenue area {{became an}} {{important}} commercial hub in the eastern sector. This development was extended to Barrio Alto, which became an attractive location {{for the construction of}} high-rise buildings. Major companies and financial corporations were established in the area, which gave rise to a thriving modern business center known as Sanhattan. The departure of these companies to Barrio Alto and the construction of shopping centers all around the city created a crisis in the city center. To <b>reinvent</b> <b>the</b> area, the main shopping streets were turned into pedestrian walkways, such as the Paseo Ahumada, and the government instituted tax benefits for the construction of residential buildings, which attracted young adults.|$|E

500|$|Two other singles were {{released}} that year: [...] "Fix You" [...] in September and [...] "Talk" [...] in December. Critical reaction to X was mostly positive, though slightly less enthusiastic {{than that of}} its predecessor. The New York Times critic Jon Pareles described Coldplay as [...] "the most insufferable band of the decade", whereas NME awarded the album 9/10 calling it [...] "Confident, bold, ambitious, bunged with singles and impossible to contain, 'X' doesn't <b>reinvent</b> <b>the</b> wheel but it does reinforce Coldplay as the band of their time". Comparisons between Coldplay and U2 became increasingly common. Chris Martin later revealed that the reviews that ranged from mixed to negative, note-worthy for their remarks on comparing them to U2, made him feel [...] "liberated".|$|E
