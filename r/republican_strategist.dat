[...] <b>Republican</b> <b>strategist</b> Ed Rollins questioned whether Trump could [...] "say the right things" [...] or [...] "be willing to let somebody put an organization together." [...] A New York Daily News/WNBC-TV poll showed that 74% of New Yorkers believed the campaign was being used only for Trump [...] "to promote himself." [...] Roger Stone commented that the perception problem would [...] "solve itself" [...] once the campaign would reveal the number of petition signatures it collected. [...] By mid-November, the campaign started receiving advice from political consultant Douglas Friedline, who ran Ventura's successful 1998 gubernatorial campaign. [...] Upon Friedline's advice, Trump assembled communications and campaign staff, and began planning events in strategic states. As a further step in organization, Trump set up a campaign website at the domain www.donaldjtrump2000.com and used Ventura's webmaster, Phil Madsen, to create an online community of supporters.|$|E

2500|$|Associate Justice Harold See was {{the heavy}} {{favorite}} to win the Republican nomination because of his support from the state business community and the party hierarchy, including Chief Justice Hooper.

[...] Judge Moore also beat two other opponents, Criminal Appeals Judge Pam Baschab, and Jefferson County Presiding Circuit Judge Wayne Thorn, in the Republican Primary—without a runoff—garnering over 50% of the statewide primary vote.
