40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the effect of sugar beet re-growth after water stress {{defoliation}} on <b>root</b> <b>rots</b> of three cultivars (Europa, Rival Corsica), which were spring sown in Thessaly, central Greece, for two growing seasons (2003 - 04). At the beginning of July, sugar beets were subjected to water deficit with irrigation withholding. A month later, three defoliation levels (control - C, moderate - MD, severe - SD) and irrigation were applied. Thus, sugar beets were forced to re-grow and three harvests (15, 30 and 40 days after defoliation - DAD) were conducted. <b>Rotted</b> <b>roots</b> per hectare were counted and pathogens were identified. Data were analyzed as a four-factor randomized complete block design with years, defoliation levels, sampling times and cultivars as main factors. The number of <b>rotted</b> <b>roots</b> was increased with the defoliation level and was significantly higher for SD sugar beets (3748 roots ha– 1). No {{significant differences were found}} between C and MD treatments (1543 and 2116 roots ha– 1, respectively). Rival was the most susceptible cultivar to <b>root</b> <b>rots.</b> Sugar beets were more susceptible to rotting 15 and 40 DAD (2778 and 2998 roots ha– 1). The causal agents of <b>root</b> <b>rots</b> were the fungi, Fusarium spp., Rhizopus stolonifer, Macrophomina phaseolina and Rhizoctonia solani...|$|R
5|$|Methods for {{controlling}} {{the spread of}} Armillaria <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> include physical removal of infected trees, stumps and large roots; fumigation of soil around infected hosts; and injection of fumigants directly into infected hosts. These methods are often not practical due to high cost, introduction of toxic chemicals that affect other organisms, or health and safety issues for the operator. Biological control is another method that has been investigated to control <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> caused by A.luteobubalina. In one study, thinning stumps of Eucalyptus diversicolor were simultaneously inoculated with A.luteobubalina {{and one of the}} saprobic wood decay fungi Coriolus versicolor, Stereum hirsutum and Xylaria hypoxylon; all three fungi significantly reduced infection by A.luteobubalinea. These results were echoed in another study of stumps in karri regrowth forests, where it was shown that the presence of other wood decay fungi suppressed the growth of A.luteobubalina on the stump base.|$|E
5|$|Planted bulbs are {{susceptible}} to nematodes, the most serious of which is Ditylenchus dipsaci (Narcissus eelworm), {{the main cause of}} basal plate disease in which the leaves turn yellow and become misshapen. Infested bulbs have to be destroyed; where infestation is heavy avoiding planting further narcissi for another five years. Other nematodes include Aphelenchoides subtenuis, which penetrates the roots causing basal plate disease and Pratylenchus penetrans (lesion nematode) the main cause of <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> in narcissi.|$|E
5|$|Purified water {{should be}} used for {{watering}} purposes, although 'hard water' is tolerated. This is done to minimise the build-up of minerals and chemicals in the soil. Water purity greater than 100p.p.m. of total dissolved solids is often quoted as ideal. A reverse osmosis unit can be used to filter the water or, alternatively, bottled distilled water can be purchased. Watering should be done regularly. However, plants {{should not be allowed to}} sit in water, as this may lead to <b>root</b> <b>rot.</b>|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{stands of}} western larch, Larix occidentalis, on the St. Joe, Coeur d'Alene, and Kaniksu National Forests, Idaho, {{show signs of}} gradual {{deterioration}} following repeated defoliation by larch casebearer, Coleophora Zaricella Hbn. (Tunnock et al. 1969). Stand deterioration can occur after 4 years of continued heavy defoliation. The main symptom is epicormic branching. Upon examination, many of these dead and dying larch have been infested by the western larch borer, Tetropium veZutinum LeConte, or infected by <b>root</b> <b>rotting</b> fungi. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if larch severely weakened by larch casebearer feeding would die if they were not attacked by borers or <b>root</b> <b>rots...</b>|$|R
25|$|The Index of Plant Diseases in the United States lists 133 fungi and 10 {{other causes}} of {{diseases}} on Carya species (4,9). Most of the fungi are saprophytes, {{but a few}} are damaging to foliage, produce cankers, or cause trunk or <b>root</b> <b>rots.</b>|$|R
5|$|Despite {{not being}} an {{agricultural}} weed in itself, it hosts {{a number of}} insects and diseases, including both pests and beneficial insects. It is also a potential reservoir of the cucumber mosaic virus, Erysiphum cichoraceum (the cucurbit powdery mildew) and Texas <b>root</b> <b>rot.</b> A study found V.thapsus hosts insects from 29 different families. Most of the pests found were western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis), Lygus species such as the tarnished plant bug (L. lineolaris), and various spider mites from the family Tetranychidae. These make the plant a potential reservoir for overwintering pests.|$|E
5|$|Fungal {{diseases}} include wirestem, {{which causes}} weak or dying transplants; Fusarium yellows, which result in stunted and twisted plants with yellow leaves; and blackleg (see Leptosphaeria maculans), {{which leads to}} sunken areas on stems and gray-brown spotted leaves. The fungi Alternaria brassicae and A.brassicicola cause dark leaf spots in affected plants. They are both seedborne and airborne, and typically propagate from spores in infected plant debris left on the soil surface for up to twelve weeks after harvest. Rhizoctonia solani causes the post-emergence disease wirestem, resulting in killed seedlings ("damping-off"), <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> or stunted growth and smaller heads.|$|E
5|$|Violet <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> {{caused by}} the fungus Helicobasidium purpureum {{sometimes}} affects the roots, covering them with a purplish mat to which soil particles adhere. The leaves become distorted and discolored and the mycelium can spread through the soil between plants. Some weeds can harbour this fungus and it is more prevalent in wet, acid conditions. Erysiphe heraclei causes a powdery mildew that can cause significant crop loss. Infestation by this causes results in yellowing of the leaf and loss of foliage. Moderate temperatures and high humidity favor {{the development of the}} disease.|$|E
30|$|Wood rot {{disease is}} {{classified}} according {{to each of}} the three areas affected - <b>root</b> <b>rots,</b> <b>root</b> and butt <b>rots</b> and stem rots (Arya and Perelló 2010). All wood rots grow inside the wood cells and degrade cell wall components. Brown rot fungi use cell wall polysaccharides and leave the lignin, while white rot fungi degrade lignin as well as all other wood components (Adaskaveg et al. 1993; Adaskaveg et al. 1991).|$|R

5|$|Cowpea is {{susceptible}} to nematode, fungal, bacterial and virus diseases, which can result in substantial loss in yield. Common diseases include blights, <b>root</b> <b>rot,</b> wilt, powdery mildew, root knot, rust and leaf spot. The plant is {{susceptible to}} mosaic viruses, which cause a green mosaic pattern {{to appear in the}} leaves. The cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), discovered in 1959, has become a useful research tool. CPMV is stable and easy to propagate to a high yield, making it useful in vector development and protein expression systems. One of the plant's defenses against some insect attacks is the cow pea trypsin inhibitor (CpTI). CpTI is the only gene obtained outside of B. thuringiensis that has been inserted into a commercially available genetically modified crop.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{tests have}} shown P.semilanceata to {{suppress}} {{the growth of the}} soil-borne water mold Phytophthora cinnamomi, a virulent plant pathogen that causes the disease <b>root</b> <b>rot.</b> When grown in dual culture with other saprobic fungi isolated from the rhizosphere of grasses from its habitat, P.semilanceata significantly suppresses their growth. This antifungal activity, which can be traced at least partly to two phenolic compounds it secretes, helps it compete successfully with other fungal species in the intense competition for nutrients provided by decaying plant matter. Using standard antimicrobial susceptibility tests, Psilocybe semilanceata was shown to strongly inhibit the growth of the human pathogen methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The source of the antimicrobial activity is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} fungi infect {{the roots of}} waratahs, causing {{significant}} plant morbidity or death. Typical symptoms include yellow leaves, wilting, blackening and dieback or part {{or all of the}} plant, or lack of proteoid roots. The most common pathogen is the soil-borne water mold Phytophthora cinnamomi, which appears to be more problematic in cultivated plants than in wild populations. Mass plantings at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney and at Mount Annan planted before the 2000 Summer Olympics were devastated by the disease. Rhizoctonia solani can cause damping off or <b>root</b> <b>rot,</b> and is an uncommon pathogen. Cylindrocarpon scoparium and C. destructans (now Nectria radicicola) are also uncommon causes of infection and result in decay of the crown of the plant. Although significant problems, fungi {{are less likely to be}} the cause of plant morbidity than poor drainage or soil conditions.|$|E

5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that the spread of Armillaria <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> in {{eucalypt}} forests is associated with infected stumps that remain after an area has been logged. Armillaria luteobubalina can persist on these stumps, using them as a source of food for up to 25 or more years. In one case reported in Ovens, Victoria, the disease was spread to blueberry plants (Vaccinium species) via buried fragments of infected Eucalyptus that remained following preparation of the previously forested site for planting. In individual forest stands, fungal infection is usually found in discrete disease patches separated by stands of healthy trees—a discontinuous distribution. Large-scale aerial photography can be used to identify regions of forest infected by the species. The species also causes damage to trees and bushes in coastal dune woodlands, shrubland, and heath communities. It can be found on a wide range of hosts, but is most commonly associated with (in order of decreasing frequency) jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), bull banksia (Banksia grandis), marri (E.calophylla), Lasiopetalum floribundum, and Acacia saligna. It has also infected scattered populations of wandoo (E. wandoo). The fungus has also been reported to infect Nothofagus species in Argentina, and Pinus radiata in Chile.|$|E

40|$|Seed and {{seedling}} diseases, <b>root</b> <b>rots,</b> and wilts {{are caused}} {{by a number of}} soilborne fungi, all of which are facultative saprophytes and can survive in soil for long periods {{in the absence of a}} susceptible host. In general, these diseases are serious yield constraints where short rotations or monoculture of legume crops are the rule. Seedling diseases and <b>root</b> <b>rots</b> are enhanced by poor seed vigor, poor seedbed preparation, and other biotic and abiotic stresses which predispose the host plant. Control of these diseases requires an integrated approach of genetic resistance/tolerance, cultural practices, appropriate seed treatments, and high seed vigor. The most economical and durable control of Fusarium wilt is to grow resistant varieties. New races of a wilt pathogen have arisen due to increased selection pressure from growing resistant varieties in short rotations but have not outpaced the development of resistant cultivars...|$|R
50|$|Needle cast {{diseases}} {{in general are}} somewhat difficult to diagnose simply because their symptoms are similar to low pH, poor nutrition, fertilizer or chemical burn, and even <b>root</b> <b>rots.</b> Correct diagnosis requires microscopic examination of {{the size and shape}} of the fungal producing ascospores. Unfortunately these fungal spores are produced quite infrequently; after the disease infects needles, it will not produce symptoms or additional spores until the following year. In addition, Cyclaneusma may not be the only fungus present on the diseased needles. Saprophytic fungi live on dead tissue and may therefore continue to worsen the infection on needles after they have fallen. Saprophytes will also be present if the needles were killed by fertilizer burn or <b>root</b> <b>rots.</b> Due to these obstacles, it is important to examine the spores directly after infection (while spores are being produced) in order to ensure that Cyclaneusma is indeed the pine’s cause of death.|$|R

40|$|A {{faba bean}} rhizospheric Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate RZ 9 {{was used for}} {{studying}} its antifungal activity and protecting effects of faba bean and common bean against the root pathogen Fusarium culmorum strain MZB 47. The dual culture tests showed that RZ 9 inhibits MZB 47 in vitro growth by 56 %. When mixing RZ 9 cell suspension with MZB 47 macroconidia at equal proportion, the macroconidia viability was reduced with 70 %. Pathogenicity tests conducted in sterile conditions showed that MZB 47 caused an intense <b>root</b> <b>rotting</b> in faba bean ‘Aquadulce’ plantlets and a slight level in common bean ‘Coco blanc’. This was associated to significant decreases in plant growth only in ‘Aquadulce’, reducing shoot dry weight (DW) by 82 % and root DW by 70 %. In soil samples, MZB 47 caused severe <b>root</b> <b>rotting</b> and induced significant decreases in shoot DW (up to 51 %) and root DW (up to 60 %) for both beans. It was associated to a decrease in nodule number by 73 % and 52 % for faba bean and common bean, respectively. Biocontrol assays revealed that the inoculation of RZ 9 to MZB 47 -treated plantlets enhanced shoot DWs (25 % and 110 %) and root DWs (29 % and 67 %), in faba bean and common bean, respectively. Moreover, <b>root</b> <b>rotting</b> levels decreased and nodule number increased in treated compared to untreated plantlets.
