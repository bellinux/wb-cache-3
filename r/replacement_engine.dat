25|$|In May 2011 the National Railway Museum (NRM) {{announced}} that the remaining HST prototype power car 41001 would undergo full restoration work. A long-term loan was agreed between the NRM and the 125 Group of volunteers for the locomotive and a Paxman Valenta RP200L engine. The <b>replacement</b> <b>engine</b> (no. S508) was required as the original Valenta engine (no. S183) had been sectioned for display purposes. The S508 engine was lifted into the locomotive at Neville Hill TMD on 29 June 2012.|$|E
500|$|The {{loss of the}} {{prototype}} and {{some changes in the}} construction of the production model delayed the fulfilment of the contract. Further tests were conducted on the wing and it was found to withstand a g-force of 14. Modifications were made for the production model, including the use of flat plexiglass panels in the windscreen and the canopy to provide better visibility for the pilot. The instrument layout was improved and the upper rear fuselage behind the pilot's seat was re-shaped. The folding undercarriage leg covers were replaced by single plates. The main changes were the replacement of the engine with a modified version of the Hispano-Suiza 12Y engine made under licence by the Czechoslovak company Avia and the replacement of the cannon by a Swiss-made Oerlikon FF 20 mm cannon. The <b>replacement</b> <b>engine</b> was less powerful, generating [...] at [...] German-made Telefunken radios were to be installed but delays meant that only the first aircraft was delivered with a radio fitted. The production aircraft were numbered 2–13, as {{the prototype}} was number 1. The aircraft were built at the Rogožarski factory in Belgrade and the parts were assembled at the company hangar at Zemun. The first six aircraft were delivered by late March 1940 but delivery of the rest of the order was not completed until July due to delays by foreign suppliers. The first production aircraft was delivered to the VVKJ Test Group, where it was determined that the production aircraft were free of the faults in the prototype. The Test Group determined that the maximum speed, previously estimated at , was , at [...] By July 1940, a further series of 25 IK-3s had commenced construction at the Rogožarski factory.|$|E

50|$|<b>Replacement</b> <b>engines</b> {{are used}} to replace classic car engines that are in poor {{condition}} or broken, or to install a more powerful engine in a vehicle. <b>Replacement</b> <b>engines</b> are often used to make old cars more reliable for daily driving.

During testing it was found that a third vertical stabiliser was also required.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Rolls-Royce {{was also}} working {{on a series of}} triple-spool designs as {{replacements}} for the Conway, which promised to deliver higher efficiencies. In this configuration, three groups of turbines spin three separate concentric shafts to power three sections of the compressor area running at different speeds. In addition to allowing each stage of the compressor to run at its optimal speed, the triple-spool design is also more compact and rigid, although more complex to build and maintain. Several designs were being worked on at the time, including a 10,000lbf (44kN) thrust design [...] known as the RB203 intended to replace the Rolls-Royce Spey. Work started on the Conway <b>replacement</b> <b>engine</b> in July 1961 and a twin-spool demonstrator engine to prove the HP compressor, combustor, and turbine system designs, had been run by 1966. Rolls-Royce chose the triple-spool system in 1965 as the simplest, lowest cost {{solution to the problem of}} obtaining lower fuel consumption and reduced noise levels at a constant power setting. Work on the RB211 as essentially a scaled-down RB207 began in 1966-7 with the first certificated engines being scheduled to be available by December 1970 at 33,260lb take-off thrust and at a price of $511,000 each.|$|E

In addition, S&S Cycle developed their own proprietary pushrod v-twin engine, dubbed the X-Wedge that features a 56° cylinder angle instead of the 45° angle used in Harley-Davidson v-twin engines, and which was developed with the custom motorcycle builder (OEM) in mind. The X-Wedge is the basis for the engine from a number of high end motorcycle manufacturers such as Arch Motorcycle and Confederate Motorcycle. The X-Wedge recently found a different kind of application, having been chosen to be the power plant utilized by Morgan Motor company, based out of the United Kingdom, for their development of the Morgan 3 Wheeler cycle car.|$|R

The Buffalos sent to Finland were de-navalized; all the naval equipment, such as tailhooks and life-raft containers were removed, resulting in a lighter aircraft. The Finnish F2A-1s also lacked self-sealing fuel tanks and cockpit armor.|$|R
25|$|The {{introduction}} of the TriStar led {{to an increase in}} maintenance personnel and the modification of an existing hangar at the airline's Luton base to accommodate the new widebody.
