In a {{subsequent}} <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiations</b> with Croatian authorities, the SAO SBWS representatives reported 56 or 57 Croats were killed in Dalj on 1 August. Twenty-five bodies of the victims, including two civilians, were transferred to ZNG-held Osijek. Post-mortem examinations indicated {{some of the victims}} were beaten and then executed.|$|E
5|$|During 1987, {{relations}} improved steadily, with U.S. military inspectors {{present at}} Soviet military manoeuvres, {{an agreement to}} establish centers on Reducing Nuclear Threat, and a first <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiations</b> aimed at banning nuclear tests. The thaw in relations {{was reflected in the}} cultural sphere. Matlock’s invitation to ballerina Maya Plisetskaya to attend a reception at Spaso House provided a way for Matlock to judge Gorbachev’s intentions, as earlier Soviet leaders would have considered it a provocation.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} a tunnel under Loveland Pass existed {{at least since the}} 1940s. Serious {{discussion}} began when the state of Colorado lobbied for the Interstate Highway System to route a transcontinental highway across Colorado. After a <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiations</b> with Utah officials, it was decided the best option was to follow the U.S. Route 6 corridor. Engineers recommended to tunnel under the pass, rather than attempt to build a route across it that conformed to Interstate Highway standards.|$|E
30|$|If the {{numerical}} value of α is low (i.e., − 0.9 ≤α≤− 0.6), the negotiator agent A takes his previous counter-price (which {{was made in}} previous <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> which is A’s turn to move) into account as the counter-price that should be proposed to the trading opponent in the current <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiation</b> which is A’s turn to move. Such an action is the most affectionate pressure {{that can be applied}} to the trading opponent. See Algorithm (5) which is applied by customer agents and Algorithm (6) which is applied by provider agents.|$|R

5|$|During the Bahraini {{uprising}} of 2011, the Khawalid brothers {{objected to}} {{compromise with the}} opposition and instead preferred crackdown. After a failed <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiations</b> led by the CP, the Khawalid brothers led the crackdown, described as the widest in Bahrain's modern history. The Commander in Chief of the army, Khalifa bin Ahmed, was given wide authority with the announcement of martial law; he led a main crackdown operation, presided over military courts and made several interviews with regional and local media. Another Al Khawalid involved in the crackdown was the then-director of the National Security Agency, which {{was found to be}} responsible for arbitrary arrests and systematic torture. The crackdown empowered the Khawalid brothers faction further and marginalized the CP, who found himself and allies stripped from their powers.|$|E
5|$|The Cuban {{government}} joined {{negotiations on}} 28 January 1988, {{and all three}} parties held a <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiations</b> on 9 March. The South African government joined negotiations on 3 May and the parties met in June and August in New York and Geneva. All parties agreed to a ceasefire on 8 August. Representatives from the governments of Angola, Cuba, and South Africa signed the New York Accords, granting independence to Namibia and ending the direct involvement of foreign troops in the civil war, in New York City on 22 December 1988. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 626 later that day, creating the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM), a peacekeeping force. UNAVEM troops began arriving in Angola in January 1989.|$|E
5|$|Three more {{attempts}} {{to revive the}} plan were made after Operation Flash in early May, when Croatia captured a portion of western Slavonia previously controlled by the RSK. The first initiative, that began later that month, failed because the RSK demanded that the Croatian forces pull back from western Slavonia (which Croatia declined to do). The second attempt failed simply because neither party wanted to negotiate. The final <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiations</b> where the Z-4 Plan was proposed by international diplomats occurred in early August, when a major Croatian attack against the RSK seemed imminent. Despite last-ditch efforts by Galbraith to persuade Milošević and the RSK leadership to accept the plan, disagreement among the RSK leaders allowed Croatia {{to claim that the}} RSK had no intention of negotiating. The Croatian delegation, which had little interest in the negotiations and wanted to lay the diplomatic groundwork for the imminent military operation, presented its own demands to the RSK (which were also rejected). On 4 August Croatia launched Operation Storm, defeated the RSK and effectively ended the political process which {{led to the creation of}} the Z-4 Plan.|$|E

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} simple formal model that can explain {{why and how}} European states engaged in the <b>negotiation</b> <b>of</b> federalist {{treaties}} {{in the fields of}} European defense and security. Using the non-cooperative model of multilateral bargaining derived from the Stahl-Rubinstein game, we show that the specific sequencing <b>of</b> treaty <b>negotiations</b> adopted by federalists explains why, against all odds, states preferred federalist-inspired treaties to intergovernmental treaties. We argue that federalists succeeded in convincing states to sign their treaties, rather than alternative treaties, by spreading the risk of rejection attached to various components of European security treaties into successive periods <b>of</b> <b>negotiations,</b> a process that they repeated in each new <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiation.</b> In doing so, we show that Jean Monnet and his transnational network of European federalists had an influence on the process of EU integration because they segmented treaties into components with different probabilities of acceptance, and structured the different <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiations</b> <b>of</b> these components by starting with the less risky ones, rather than because they convinced states to change their preferences and adopt federalist treaties instead of intergovernmental treaties...|$|R
25|$|While the {{countries}} {{agreed to a}} moratorium on undersea drilling in 1967, increased speculation {{about the existence of}} large oil deposits combined with the need to diversify economies after the regional cod fishery collapse triggered a new <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiations.</b>|$|E
25|$|The next <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiations</b> {{began in}} 2011, when the {{previous}} contract expired.

25|$|After {{a devastating}} 2003 <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiations</b> {{resulting}} in wage freezes and insurance increases, the 2005 negotiations team had a resolute goal to ‘hold the line’ on insurance increases while negotiating a fair wage increase.

25|$|As {{preparations}} for the district court hearing began, the government tried to secure a wage settlement. Independent talks failed.

Arnall threatened to give the steel companies no price rise, then Putnam ordered a $3-per-ton price increase. Neither tactic budged the steelmakers. Sawyer threatened to impose a wage increase; that stratagem failed. Sawyer then formally gave the workers a small pay raise; once more, the talks stalled.|$|E
25|$|Not {{willing to}} deal with Hanno again, and feeling insulted by Hamilcar for not having met {{with them in the}} first <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiations,</b> the mercenaries agreed to {{negotiate}} with Gesco. Given their newly strengthened bargaining position, the mercenaries vastly inflated their original demands, even requiring the extension of the payments to the Libyans whom Carthage had conscripted (and who were not mercenaries) as well as other Numidians and to the escaped slaves and the like who had joined their ranks against Carthage. Once again Carthage {{had no choice but to}} agree.|$|E
25|$|On 27 February 2009, a {{free trade}} {{agreement}} (FTA) with the ASEAN regional bloc of ten countries and Australia, and its close partner New Zealand was signed.

25|$|In the {{following}} year, Titus Lartius Flavus was appointed the first dictator, {{and as his}} magister equitum he nominated Cassius. The reason for the institution of these offices was the fear of impending war with both the Sabines and the Latins. After a failed <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiations,</b> war was declared against the Sabines, but as both sides were reluctant to come to blows, no hostilities ensued. War with the Latins came in 498 BC, with the Battle of Lake Regillus. Following the Roman victory, Cassius {{is said to have}} urged the senate to destroy the Latin towns.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the many}} changes McCardell made was to fire 11,000 of the company's 15,000 mid- and upper-level managers, whom McCardell felt were {{too close to}} UAW shop stewards. McCardell took {{personal}} control of IH's labor relations, and appointed a new vice president of human resources, W. Grant Chandler (who was to assist McCardell in all union negotiations). McCardell's actions stripped the company of nearly all its experienced labor negotiators, and those who remained were mostly ignored during the upcoming <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiations.</b> McCardell and Chandler had little labor relations experience, however, and none in heavy manufacturing or in negotiating with the UAW.|$|E
