5|$|The Japanese {{angelshark}} {{is typically}} inoffensive towards humans, but if disturbed, can inflict a severe bite. Across {{much of its}} range, it is a frequent catch (intentional or not) in bottom trawls and probably also set nets and demersal gillnets; the meat is eaten and the <b>rough</b> <b>skin</b> is made into a type of leather called shagreen for use in wood finishing.|$|E
5|$|On the {{infrequent}} {{occasions when}} they swim in oceanic waters, grey reef sharks often associate with marine mammals or large pelagic fishes, such as sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus). There is {{an account of}} around 25 grey reef sharks following a large pod of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.), along with 25 silky sharks (C. falciformis) and a single silvertip shark. Rainbow runners (Elagatis bipinnulata) have been observed rubbing against grey reef sharks, using the sharks' <b>rough</b> <b>skin</b> to scrape off parasites.|$|E
5|$|Though silvertip {{sharks are}} quite mobile, they exhibit {{fidelity}} to certain areas {{and there are}} reports of territorial behavior. They are usually encountered alone or in pairs. Small groups of adult females have been seen in deep water. Individual silvertip sharks behave very aggressively towards one another, and many are heavily scarred. They are also reported to dominate Galapagos sharks (C. galapagensis) and blacktip sharks (C. limbatus) of equal size when competing for food. This shark sometimes forms mixed-species aggregations with grey reef sharks. Rainbow runners (Elagatis bipinnulata) have been observed rubbing against silvertip sharks, using the sharks' <b>rough</b> <b>skin</b> to scrape off parasites. They sometimes follow marine mammals such as bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) in open water, and are themselves followed by pilot fish (Naucrates ductor).|$|E

5|$|Throughout its range, the bowmouth {{guitarfish}} {{is caught}} incidentally or intentionally by artisanal and commercial fisheries using trawls, gillnets, and line gear. The fins are extremely valuable {{due to their}} use in shark fin soup, and are often the only parts of the fish kept and brought to market. However, the meat may also be sold fresh or dried and salted, and it is highly esteemed in India. When caught as bycatch in trawls, the bowmouth guitarfish is considered a nuisance because its strength and <b>rough</b> <b>skin</b> {{make it difficult to}} handle, and as the heavy ray thrashes in the net it can damage the rest of the catch. In Thailand, the enlarged thorns of this species are used to make bracelets.|$|E
5|$|During group interactions, Galapagos {{sharks are}} {{dominant}} to blacktip sharks (C. limbatus) but deferent to silvertip sharks (C. albimarginatus) of equal size. When confronted or cornered, the Galapagos shark may perform a threat display {{similar to that}} of the grey reef shark, in which the shark performs an exaggerated, rolling swimming motion while arching its back, lowering its pectoral fins, puffing out its gills, and gaping its jaw. The shark may also swing its head from side to side, so as to keep the perceived threat within its field of vision. A known parasite of the Galapagos shark is the flatworm Dermophthirius carcharhini, which attaches to the shark's skin. In one account, a bluefin trevally (Caranax melampygus) was seen rubbing against the <b>rough</b> <b>skin</b> of a Galapagos shark to rid itself of parasites.|$|E
25|$|The {{skin of the}} ray is used as an under layer for {{the cord}} or leather wrap (known as ito in Japanese) on Japanese swords due to its hard, <b>rough,</b> <b>skin</b> texture that keeps the braided wrap from sliding on the handle during use.

25|$|Galeus is a genus of catshark, {{belonging}} to the family Scyliorhinidae, commonly known as sawtail catsharks in reference to a distinctive saw-toothed crest of enlarged dermal denticles, found along the upper edges of their caudal fins. They {{are found in the}} Atlantic, the western and central Pacific, and the Gulf of California, inhabiting deep waters at or close to the sea floor. Members of this genus are rather small, slim sharks with firm bodies and thick, <b>rough</b> <b>skin.</b> Their heads are usually fairly long and pointed, and have large mouths with well-developed furrows at the corners. They have large pectoral and anal fins, and two similar dorsal fins placed well back. Many species are ornately patterned with dark saddles and/or blotches. Sawtail catsharks feed on various invertebrates and fishes, and may be either egg-laying or live-bearing. These harmless sharks are sometimes caught as bycatch but are of minimal commercial value.|$|E
500|$|The cloudy {{catshark}} (Scyliorhinus torazame) is {{a common}} species of catshark, belonging to the family Scyliorhinidae.

It is also characterized by extremely <b>rough</b> <b>skin</b> and coloration consisting of a series of dark brown saddles along its back and tail, along with various darker and lighter spots in larger individuals.|$|E
500|$|Humans {{have used}} the {{angelshark}} for thousands of years. Ancient Greek authors, such as Diphilus and Mnesitheus, described its meat as [...] "light" [...] and [...] "easily digestible", and Pliny the Elder noted in his Naturalis Historia (77â€“79 AD) that its <b>rough</b> <b>skin</b> was valued by craftsmen for polishing wood and ivory. Aristotle recorded elements of its natural history, including that it bore live young, and correctly recognized {{that it was a}} shark despite its resemblance to rays and skates. The use of this species for food has continued into modern times; it is sold fresh or dried and salted, often under the name [...] "monkfish" [...] (which also refers to the goosefishes of the genus Lophius). The angelshark may also be a source for shark liver oil and fishmeal.|$|E
50|$|The skate family Rajidae {{contains}} 14 genera {{and around}} 200 species. They are found worldwide, but are relatively uncommon near coral reefs and in shallow tropical seas. A few species occur in brackish water. The disc shape is rhomboidal, and the tail long. Two dorsal fins are found and the caudal fin is much reduced. The pelvic fins have two lobes. Most species have <b>rough</b> <b>skins</b> with dermal denticles which are especially obvious along the spine. The eggs are laid in a protective hard case with string-like elongations {{at the four}} corners.|$|R

500|$|Nursehounds have nocturnal {{habits and}} {{generally}} hide inside small holes during the day, often associating {{with other members}} of its species. A benthic predator, it feeds on a range of bony fishes, smaller sharks, crustaceans, and cephalopods. Like other catsharks, the nursehound is oviparous in reproduction. Females deposit large, thick-walled egg cases, two at a time, from March to October, securing them to bunches of seaweed. The eggs take 712 months to hatch. Nursehounds are marketed as food in several European countries under various names, including [...] "flake", [...] "catfish", [...] "rock eel", and [...] "rock salmon". It was once also valued for its <b>rough</b> <b>skin</b> (called [...] "rubskin"), which was used as an abrasive. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the nursehound as Near Threatened, as its population in the Mediterranean Sea seems to have declined substantially from overfishing.|$|E
500|$|The <b>rough</b> <b>skin</b> (called [...] "rubskin") of the {{nursehound}} {{was once}} used to polish wood and alabaster, to smooth arrows and barrels, {{and to raise}} the hairs of beaver hats {{as a replacement for}} pumice. Rubskin was so valued that a pound of it was worth a hundredweight of sandpaper. The liver was also used as a source of oil, and the carcasses cut up and used to bait crab traps. The meat of this species is marketed fresh or dried and salted, though it is considered [...] "coarse" [...] in some quarters. In the United Kingdom, {{it is one of the}} species sold under the names [...] "flake", [...] "catfish", [...] "huss" [...] "rock eel", or [...] "rock salmon". In France, it is sold as grande roussette or saumonette, as after being skinned and beheaded it resembles salmon. This species is also sometimes processed into fishmeal, or its fins dried and exported to the Asian market. In European waters, commercial production of this species is led by France, followed by the UK and Portugal; it is caught using bottom trawls, gillnets, bottom set longlines, handlines and fixed bottom nets. In 2004, a total catch of 208 tons was reported from the northeastern Atlantic.|$|E

50|$|The <b>rough</b> <b>skinned</b> newt uses {{a form of}} {{chemical}} based avoidance behavior to evade being eaten by predators, mainly the common garter snake. The snakes, after swallowing, digesting, and metabolizing a rough-skinned newt, release a chemical signature. This stimulus can be detected by a nearby newt and trigger an avoidant response, which allows them to minimize predation risks. In this way, newts are able to differentiate whether a snake is resistant or sensitive to the toxin {{in order to avoid}} being preyed upon. However, newts do not avoid the corpses of a recently digested newt that has been left to decompose. This behavior is unlike salamanders that have been documented in avoiding other damaged salamanders.|$|R
