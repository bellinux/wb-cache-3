5|$|One {{proposed}} change is to admit more permanent members. The candidates usually mentioned are Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan. They comprise {{the group of}} G4 nations, mutually supporting one another's bids for permanent seats. The United Kingdom, France and Russia support G4 membership in the U.N. Security Council. This sort of <b>reform</b> <b>has</b> traditionally been opposed by the Uniting for Consensus group, which is composed primarily of nations who are regional rivals and economic competitors of the G4. The group is led by Italy and Spain (opposing Germany), Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina (opposing Brazil), Pakistan (opposing India), and South Korea (opposing Japan), in addition to Turkey, Indonesia and others. Since 1992, Italy {{and other members of}} the group have instead proposed semi-permanent seats or the expansion of the number of temporary seats.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:The {{distributional}} {{consequences of}} trade <b>reforms</b> <b>have</b> attracted greater attention {{in recent decades}} {{due to the fact}} that most countries experienced an increase in inequality during the post-reforms period. This paper attempts to review some selected studies covering both theory and recent empirical research. There are some emerging evidence that trade <b>reforms</b> <b>have</b> improved wage distribution though the majority of studies concludes that the <b>reforms</b> <b>have</b> worsened wage inequality in many countries...|$|R
40|$|Corporate {{governance}} <b>reforms</b> <b>have</b> been {{motivated to}} a considerable degree by concerns about the possible malfunctioning of the executive remuneration determination process in large firms. It is not clear, however, how effective these <b>reforms</b> <b>have</b> been in altering pay-setting procedures {{in the direction of}} aligning executive and shareholder interests. This paper reviews some initial evidence and suggests that a mixed picture emerges. It appears that <b>reforms</b> <b>have</b> been more successful in reducing executive tenure - and hence pay-offs in the event of failure - than they have been in linking rewards to performance for continuing executives. It is clear, however, that <b>reforms</b> <b>have</b> facilitated the role for institutional shareholders in approving remuneration packages. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005. ...|$|R

40|$|Major {{economic}} <b>reforms</b> <b>have</b> {{been carried}} through in Sweden {{during the last}} two decades. Most of the <b>reforms</b> <b>have</b> been made in response to long-standing rather than to acute problems. There has usually been a strong perception among economists, policy makers and the general public of the problems that the <b>reforms</b> <b>have</b> sought to address. Reforms in other countries have sometimes provided inspiration. Most of the reforms were based on a broad political consensus. A heavy input from economic research has often been used as a basis for change...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} three decades a series of <b>reforms</b> <b>have</b> taken place in the family courts. A common goal by these <b>reforms</b> <b>has</b> been the need to extend the access to justice.

For this reason, <b>reform</b> programs <b>have</b> given priority to eradicate court delay over other problems that courts face. The chapter critically analyses the consequences of those reforms...|$|R
50|$|There {{were major}} {{reforms in the}} Irish church during the 12th century. These <b>reforms</b> <b>have</b> been {{generally}} been interpreted {{as a reaction to}} previous secularisation, but could also be seen as a continuous development. The <b>reforms</b> <b>had</b> consequences for, and were influenced by, relations within the church as well as secular politics.|$|R
25|$|Shareholder {{activism}} is rare {{despite the}} fact that the corporate law gives shareholders strong powers over managers. Under Prime Minister Shinzō Abe, corporate governance <b>reform</b> <b>has</b> been a key initiative to encourage economic growth.

25|$|The {{policy has}} evolved {{significantly}} {{since it was}} created by the Treaty of Rome (1957). Substantial reforms over the years have moved the CAP away from a production-oriented policy. The 2003 <b>reform</b> <b>has</b> introduced the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) or as it is known as well the Single Farm Payment (SFP). The most recent reform was made in 2013 by Commissioner Dacian Ciolos and applies for the period 2014 to 2020.|$|E
25|$|Australian {{political}} parties are polarised on LGBT rights issues, with stronger support from centre-left parties {{such as the}} Australian Greens and the Australian Labor Party, as well as among moderate members of the centre-right Liberal Party.

25|$|In the U.S., <b>reform</b> <b>has</b> {{typically}} {{limited the}} scope of tort law and damages available, such as limiting joint and several liability, the collateral source rule, or capping noneconomic damages for emotional distress or punitive damages. These reform statutes are sometimes rejected as unconstitutional under the state constitutions by state supreme courts, with the Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution possibly also relevant. Theoretical and policy considerations are central to fixing liability for pure economic loss and of public bodies.|$|E
25|$|The European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) of the EU, {{which used}} to fund the CAP has been {{replaced}} in 2007 with the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). CAP <b>reform</b> <b>has</b> steadily lowered {{its share of the}} EU budget but it still accounts for nearly half of the EU expenditure. France is the biggest beneficiary of the policy by around 20%, followed by Germany and Spain (~13% each), Italy (~11%) and the UK (~9%).|$|E
25|$|Reaction {{to police}} {{brutality}} {{resulted in the}} Watts riots of 1965 and again, after the Rodney King beating, in the Los Angeles riots of 1992. Charges of police brutality dogged the Department {{through the end of}} the 20th century. In the late 1990s, as a result of the Rampart scandal involving misconduct of 70 officers, the federal government was forced to intervene and assumed jurisdiction of the Department with a consent decree. Police <b>reform</b> <b>has</b> since been a major issue confronted by L.A.'s recent mayors.|$|E

25|$|In the Northern Territory, in March 2004, the {{territory}} Government enacted the Law Reform (Gender, Sexuality and De Facto Relationships) Act 2003 to remove legislative discrimination against same-sex couples {{in most areas}} of territory law (except the Adoption Act) and recognise same-sex couples as de facto relationships. The act removed distinctions based on a person's gender, sexuality or de facto relationship in approximately 50 acts and regulations. As in NSW and the ACT, <b>reform</b> <b>has</b> also included enabling the lesbian partner of a woman to be recognised as the parent of her partner's child across state law.|$|E
25|$|The {{call for}} {{application}} of the subsidiarity principle to the CFP lies within the argument for its decentralisation. De-centralisation featured prominently in discussions related to the 2002 CFP reform, but the reform itself actually increased centralisation within the CFP, removing the right of Member States to block quota proposals and increasing the EU's role in enforcement. This increasing monopoly and disregard for {{the wishes of the}} fisheries industry led to alienation of stakeholders and resulted in reduced compliance. The failure of this increasingly centralised <b>reform</b> <b>has</b> proved to de-centralisation advocates that stakeholder participation in the governance process is crucial to the future success of fisheries governance.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} year in office her {{government}} rolled back anti-immigration legislation enacted by the previous government, and passed a tax-reform with support from the liberal-conservative opposition. The tax reform raised the top tax threshold, effectively lowering tax rates for high income earners. The aim of the tax <b>reform</b> <b>has</b> been to increase labour output to fend off a projected shortage within the next decades. The stated goal is to entice Danes to work more in order to compensate for the decreasing workforce, by lowering tax on wages and gradually lowering welfare payments to those outside of the labour market to increase the economic benefit of working relative to receiving welfare.|$|E

Working Papers describe research in progress by the author(s) and are published to elicit comments and to further debate. This paper presents a number of facts about growth in Latin America, and shows how critical correlates of growth have evolved over time. In comparison with other regions, Latin America has consistently exhibited higher macroeconomic volatility, lower openness, and higher income inequality, though openness and macroeconomic stability have improved since the early 1990 s. The paper then discusses three views of why <b>reforms</b> <b>have</b> not led to higher growth in Latin America: that <b>reforms</b> <b>have</b> gone too far; that <b>reforms</b> <b>have</b> not gone far enough; and that <b>reforms</b> <b>have</b> missed the point...|$|R
25|$|In 2009, the Pakistani {{government}} implemented an autonomy {{package for}} Gilgit-Baltistan, which entails rights {{similar to those}} of Pakistan’s other provinces. Gilgit-Baltistan thus gains province-like status without actually being conferred such status constitutionally. Direct rule by Islamabad has been replaced by an elected legislative assembly under a chief minister. The 2009 <b>reform</b> <b>has</b> not satisfied locals who demand citizenship rights and it has continued to leave Gilgit Baltistan's constitutional status within Pakistan undefined; although it has added to the self-identification of the territory. According to Antia Mato Bouzas, the PPP-led Pakistani government had attempted a compromise between its official position on Kashmir and the demands of a population where the majority may have pro-Pakistan sentiments.|$|E
25|$|The House of Freedoms' {{proposal}} of constitutional <b>reform</b> <b>has</b> {{been done in}} a unilateral way - no agreement with the opposition, whereas the current Italian Constitution was written after World War II by all the national political forces (except the fascists), ranging from Liberals, to Christian Democrats, to Socialists, to Communists and others. According to the House of Freedom, this policy was adopted in order to correct the constitutional reform approved by the former centre-left majority in 2001 (Constitutional law 3/2001) with the same modus - no agreement with the opposition. However, the new reform deeply modifies constitutional system of Italy, while the 2001 reform just partially modified {{a section of the}} Constitution.|$|E
25|$|The 2008 Conference in Blackpool was {{dominated}} by the governance review debate and vote. The proposals were for a restructuring of {{the running of the}} Union but the vote was lost by 25 votes (a two-thirds majority was required). The review was criticised for what was felt by detractors to be an attack on the organisation's democratic accountability. Its supporters however defended the review as providing a more 'innovative' corporate structure which was hoped to make it more credible in negotiating policy, rather than simply 'reactive'. This was not well received by many in the executive with President, Gemma Tumelty, vowing to press ahead with reform. The perceived lack of progress on governance <b>reform</b> <b>has</b> also prompted Imperial College Union to hold a referendum on disaffiliation.|$|E
