5|$|The 1961 season saw {{the chase}} of Babe Ruth's 1927 single season home run record by <b>Roger</b> <b>Maris</b> and Mickey Mantle. Both Maris and Mantle would {{continue}} to reach the home run record until Mantle got injured late in the season, leaving Maris to reach the record. On {{the last day of}} the season, Maris broke the record with his 61st home run of the year off Red Sox pitcher Tracy Stallard at Yankee Stadium. Former Hall of Fame shortstop for the Yankees, Phil Rizzuto, called the shot in what was one of his first games as an announcer. The Yankees won the game 1–0 to win their 26th American League pennant and then to win their 19th World Series title.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{competition}} {{as varied as}} television and football, baseball attendance at all levels declined. While the majors rebounded by the mid-1950s, the minor leagues were gutted and hundreds of semipro and amateur teams dissolved. Integration proceeded slowly: by 1953, only six of the 16 major league teams had a black player on the roster. That year, the Major League Baseball Players Association was founded. It was the first professional baseball union to survive more than briefly, but it remained largely ineffective for years. No major league team had been located west of St. Louis until 1958, when the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants relocated to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively. The majors' final all-white bastion, the Boston Red Sox, added a black player in 1959. With {{the integration of the}} majors drying up the available pool of players, the last Negro league folded the following year. In 1961, the American League reached the West Coast with the Los Angeles Angels expansion team, and the major league season was extended from 154 games to 162. This coincidentally helped <b>Roger</b> <b>Maris</b> break Babe Ruth's long-standing single-season home run record, one of the most celebrated marks in baseball. Along with the Angels, three other new franchises were launched during 1961–62. With this, the first major league expansion in 60 years, each league now had ten teams.|$|E
5|$|Ruth set the Major League Baseball single-season {{home run}} record four times, first at 29 (1919), then 54 (1920), 59 (1921), and finally 60 (1927). Ruth's 1920 and 1921 seasons are {{tied for the}} widest margin of victory for a home run {{champion}} as he topped the next highest total by 35 home runs in each season. The single season mark of 60 stood for 34 years until <b>Roger</b> <b>Maris</b> hit 61 home runs in 1961. Maris' mark was broken 37 years later by both Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa during the 1998 home run record chase, with McGwire ultimately setting the mark at 70. Barry Bonds, who also has the most career home runs, set the current single season record of 73 in 2001. The 1998 and 2001 seasons each had 4 players hit 50 or more home runs – Greg Vaughn, Ken Griffey, Jr., Sosa, and McGwire in 1998 and Alex Rodriguez, Luis Gonzalez, Sosa, and Bonds in 2001. A player has hit 50 or more home runs 42 times, 25 times since 1990. The lowest home run total to lead a major league was four, recorded in the NL by Lip Pike in 1877 and Paul Hines in 1878.|$|E

50|$|With two homers on the second-to-last day of {{the season}} and one more in the season finale. McGwire ended with 24 homers in the Cardinals uniform and 58 overall for the season. That was a single-season for a {{right-handed}} batter and fueled a winter of speculation that he might be the chosen one to break <b>Roger</b> <b>Maris's</b> hallowed record.|$|R
50|$|The 1961 Chicago White Sox {{season was}} the team's 61st {{season in the}} major leagues, and its 62nd season overall. They {{finished}} with a record 86-76, good enough for fourth place in the American League, 23 games behind the first-place New York Yankees. Their pitching staff surrendered 13 of <b>Roger</b> <b>Maris's</b> 61 home runs that year, {{the most of any}} team.|$|R

50|$|Fisher {{was used}} {{primarily}} as a starting pitcher during his 11-year MLB career. He is known for giving up a few historic home runs. One was Ted Williams's 521st in his final major league at bat (September 28, 1960). Another was <b>Roger</b> <b>Maris's</b> 60th home run of the 1961 season (September 26, 1961). Also, he gave up the first home run in Shea Stadium history, to Willie Stargell (April 17, 1964).|$|R
50|$|The 1998 Major League Baseball {{home run}} chase in Major League Baseball was the race between first baseman Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals and right fielder Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs that {{resulted}} in both players breaking <b>Roger</b> <b>Maris's</b> long-standing and highly coveted record of 61 home runs. McGwire broke Maris's record on September 8 against the Cubs and finished with 70 home runs. Sosa finished with 66.|$|R
25|$|In the 1991 movie City Slickers {{starring}} Billy Crystal, Crystal's {{character is}} seen wearing a Mets hat.

25|$|Mark McGwire {{admitted}} to using steroids throughout his professional baseball career. The admission of steroid use caused {{many cases of}} questioning {{of whether or not}} his long list of accomplishments should be rebutted.

25|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, in , Buck {{along with}} Carl Erskine broadcast {{a series of}} late-afternoon Saturday games on ABC. were the lead announcing crew for this series, which lasted one season. Despite temporarily losing the Game of the Week package in 1961, ABC still televised several games in prime time (with Buck returning to call the action). This occurred as <b>Roger</b> <b>Maris</b> was poised to tie and subsequently break Babe Ruth's regular season home run record of 60.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, St. Louis Cardinals {{first baseman}} Mark McGwire and Chicago Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa {{engaged in a}} home run race for the ages. With both rapidly {{approaching}} <b>Roger</b> <b>Maris's</b> record of 61 home runs (set in 1961), seemingly the entire nation watched as the two power hitters raced {{to be the first}} to break the record. McGwire reached 62 first on September 8, 1998, with Sosa also eclipsing it later. Sosa finished with 66 home runs, just behind McGwire's unheard-of 70. However, recent steroid allegations have marred the season in the minds of many fans.|$|R
50|$|The 1994 San Francisco Giants {{season was}} the Giants' 112th season in Major League Baseball, their 37th season in San Francisco since their move from New York {{following}} the 1957 season, and their 35th at Candlestick Park. After winning 103 games in 1993, the Giants record dropped to 55-60 in a strike-shortened season. This {{was also the}} season in which Matt Williams hit a career high 43 home runs through 115 games {{by the time the}} strike hit, on pace to finish with 61; had the season continued, Williams may {{have had a chance to}} break <b>Roger</b> <b>Maris's</b> then-single season record of 61 home runs set in 1961.|$|R
5000|$|On September 21, 1998, Davidson {{controversially}} {{ruled that}} a ball hit by St. Louis Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire in Milwaukee County Stadium was an automatic double instead of a home run. Davidson said that a fan reached over the outfield fence to catch the ball, interfering with a ball in play. The home run {{would have been the}} 66th of the season for McGwire, who had broken <b>Roger</b> <b>Maris's</b> single-season home run record earlier that month. McGwire and Cardinals president Bill DeWitt said after watching replays that they thought it should have been ruled a home run, and DeWitt attempted to appeal the ruling to Major League Baseball.|$|R

25|$|Walter Haas died in 1995, and {{the team}} was sold to San Francisco Bay Area real estate {{developers}} Steve Schott (third cousin to one-time Cincinnati Reds' owner Marge Schott), silent partner David Etheridge and Ken Hofmann, prior to the 1996 season. Once again, the Athletics' star players were traded or sold, as the new owners' goal was to cut payroll drastically. Many landed with the St. Louis Cardinals, including McGwire, Eckersley, and manager La Russa. In a turn of events eerily reminiscent of the A's <b>Roger</b> <b>Maris</b> trade 38 years before, Mark McGwire celebrated his first full season with the Cardinals by setting a new major league home run record.|$|E
25|$|One other {{note about}} ABC {{baseball}} coverage during this period. Despite temporarily losing the Game of the Week package in 1961, ABC still televised several games {{in prime time}} (with Jack Buck returning to call the action). This occurred as <b>Roger</b> <b>Maris</b> was poised to tie and subsequently break Babe Ruth's regular season home run record of 60. As with all Major League Baseball games in those days, the action was totally blacked out of major league markets. As a matter of fact, as documented in the HBO film 61*, the Maris family was welcomed into ABC's Kansas City, Missouri affiliate KMBC-TV so they could watch the in-house feed of the game, which was blacked out of Kansas City.|$|E

500|$|Davis {{received}} a tweet on June 30 from Michael Tran in Michigan asking {{him if he}} had ever used steroids. He responded [...] "No", that same day. Davis said later in an interview, [...] "I have not ever taken any PEDs. I'm not sure fans realize, we have the strictest drug testing in all of sports, even more than the Olympics. If anybody {{was going to try to}} cheat in our game, they couldn't. It's impossible to try to beat the system. Anyway, I've never taken PEDs, no. I wouldn't. Half the stuff on the list I can't even pronounce." [...] Later, Davis would say that he believed <b>Roger</b> <b>Maris's</b> 61 home run season was the true single-season home run record, due to the steroid scandal surrounding Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, and Mark McGwire.|$|R
25|$|Landrith made {{immediate}} headlines when he {{was involved}} in a scuffle against the New York Yankees on June 11. Rookie Oriole outfielder Boog Powell was hospitalized after Yankees pitcher Bud Daley beaned Powell {{in the head with a}} pitch in the top of the 4th. In the bottom of the 4th, Baltimore pitcher Robin Roberts immediately threw a fastball over the head of Yankees star <b>Roger</b> <b>Maris.</b> Maris started walking toward the mound, bat in hand. Roberts was afraid that if things got physical he would break his hand. Landrith jumped on Maris' back, clearing the benches. No punches were thrown in the incident, nor were any suspensions or fines levied by American League president Joe Cronin. The Orioles won 5-3.|$|E
25|$|In 1962, {{after another}} memorable pennant chase with the Dodgers which {{resulted}} in a second three-game playoff series with the Dodgers (after 1951) which the Giants again won by coming from behind with three runs in the ninth inning of Game 3, the Giants brought a World Series to San Francisco only to lose it four games to three to the New York Yankees. The seventh game went {{to the bottom of the}} ninth inning, with the Yankees ahead 1–0. With Matty Alou on first base and two outs, Willie Mays sliced a double down the right field line. Right fielder <b>Roger</b> <b>Maris</b> quickly got to the ball and rifled a throw to the infield, preventing Alou from scoring the tying run and keeping him at third base.|$|E
25|$|It {{would take}} another sixteen years before another player, Bernie Geoffrion, managed to score 50 {{goals in a}} single season, also while playing for Montreal. When Bobby Hull finally managed to break the season record with 54 goals in 1966, fans of the then-retired Canadiens legend, noting that Hull was playing in a 70-game schedule, demanded that the NHL {{continue}} to recognize Richard's record (similar to what Major League Baseball initially did with Babe Ruth's single-season home run record after <b>Roger</b> <b>Maris</b> broke it under similar circumstances a few years previously). Hull's fans countered that Richard had achieved his record during World War II (during which many NHLers enlisted in the military — Richard, who was notoriously prone to injury throughout his career, was deemed unfit for service) and argued that Richard's failure to match the record in peacetime, with the caliber of the NHL not similarly hindered even though he played in eleven 70-game seasons, compromised any right {{he might have to}} special consideration for the record on account of the shorter wartime schedule.|$|E
5000|$|Chapter 6: September (first half): Lupica {{writes about}} the Yankees, Wells’ quest for a second perfect game, and the home run race between McGwire and Sosa, {{both of them were}} {{attempting}} to break <b>Roger</b> <b>Maris’s</b> home run record of 61 set in 1961. Maris, a native of Minnesota spent much of his youth in Fargo, North Dakota and Lupica writes about Maris, who died in 13 years earlier in 1985, his hometown and his boyhood friends. McGwire broke Maris’ record on September 8 when he hit his 62nd home run. Lupica watched it on television with his sons and then called his father so that three generations of Lupica could share the experience. As the chapter draws to an end, Sosa also hits his 62nd home run and he and McGwire are tied for the lead as the season enters its final two weeks.|$|R

500|$|When Arnold Johnson (a {{friend of}} Topping and Yankees general manager George Weiss) became {{the owner of}} the Kansas City Athletics in 1955, his new team made many {{transactions}} with the Yankees. From 1956 to 1960, the Athletics traded many young players to the Yankees for cash and aging veterans. The trades strengthened the Yankees' roster, but brought criticism from rival clubs. Before their 1960 season, the Yankees made one such trade with the Athletics in which they acquired outfielder <b>Roger</b> <b>Maris.</b> In his first Yankees season, Maris led the league in slugging percentage, RBIs, and extra base hits, finished second with 39 home runs, and won the AL MVP Award. The 1960 Yankees won the AL pennant for the 10th time in 12 years under Stengel, and outscored the Pirates 55–27 in the seven World Series games. However, the team lost four of them, falling short of a Series championship after Bill Mazeroski hit a walk-off home run in the final game, ending a contest that Appel called [...] "one of the most memorable in baseball history."
