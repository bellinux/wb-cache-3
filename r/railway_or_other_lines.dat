The track {{being a part}} of the engine, only the single-source Transrapid vehicles and infrastructure can be operated. There is no multisourcing foreseen concerning vehicles or the highly complicated crossings and switches. Unlike classical <b>railways</b> <b>or</b> <b>other</b> infrastructure networks,as jointly administrated by the Bundesnetzagentur (Federal Network Agency) in Germany, a Transrapid system does not allow any direct competition.|$|R

50|$|This type {{of fishing}} line is expensive, {{sometimes}} four times the cost of equivalent monofilament. This can become a considerable expense, especially considering that the line is so thin that you need more of it to fill a reel spool. Sometimes, a backing of monofilament <b>or</b> <b>other</b> <b>line</b> is used under the braided line on the spool.|$|R
50|$|Sydsvenska Kuriren {{was one of}} six {{newspapers}} (and one of four communist newspapers) {{that was}} subject to a 'transport ban' during the Second World War. The 'transport ban', based on a law in place between 1940 and 1944, meant amongst other things that the newspaper could not be transported through the postal services, <b>railways</b> <b>or</b> <b>other</b> forms of public transport. In April 1940 the newspaper again became a twice-weekly, published on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The last issue of Sydsvenska Kuriren was published on March 28, 1942. Edvin E. Persson had returned as editor of Sydsvenska Kuriren during the latter period.|$|R
50|$|To {{decouple}} a subcircuit from AC signals or {{voltage spikes}} on {{a power supply}} <b>or</b> <b>other</b> <b>line,</b> a bypass capacitor is often used. A bypass capacitor is to shunt energy from those signals or transients past the subcircuit to be decoupled, right to the return path. For a power supply line, a bypass capacitor from the supply voltage line to the power supply return (neutral) would be used.|$|R

At the {{intersection}} of the lines inside the game area and the pitch limits <b>or</b> <b>other</b> <b>lines</b> within the game area, there are circles which determine the positions of the midfielders ("mijlocaşi") and side players ("mărginaşi"). The 1m and 3m semicircles are used for batting and serving. A waiting line is drawn for attacking players to wait their turn to bat.|$|R
40|$|A video {{published}} on the BGS YouTube channel shows {{an example of a}} retaining wall failure, a familiar hazard in ground engineering. An engineer designed a wall to hold the dry sandy soil whilst houses have been built above. Examples of this can be seen where roads <b>or</b> <b>railways</b> <b>or</b> <b>other</b> excavations have been built that cut into the land. Unfortunately, this wall has not been designed correctly and has started to fail. This slope failure is translational in nature {{and you can see the}} slip planes that have formed. Slope failures in (wet) clays and silts tend to fail at shallower angles and be of a 'rotational' or 'flow' type failure...|$|R

30|$|It {{is worth}} {{mentioning}} {{that there are}} two power flow dips in the result of M 2, which are the operation conditions when No. 176 line and No. 186 line are the contingencies, respectively. The reason is that two lines are parallel, leading to the impedances of these two parallel lines considerably smaller than that of lines around. When the power system operates normally <b>or</b> <b>other</b> <b>lines</b> are the contingencies, large amount of active power tends to flow on these two lines. However, when these two lines are the contingencies, large amount of active power is distributed on <b>other</b> <b>lines,</b> thereby reducing the maximum of line power flows.|$|R

Most of the male inhabitants worked in agriculture, but many had jobs in Lucknow city, in the <b>Railways</b> <b>or</b> <b>other</b> organizations. Farmers in Guraura grew sugar cane, wheat, or various kinds of daal (gram, lentils). They kept some cattle or buffalo for milk and for work.

40|$|This {{study is}} the first to find that mate {{availability}} explains much of the race gap in non marital fertility in the United States. Both a general and an education-based metric have strong effects. The novel statistical power arises from difference-indifferences for blacks and whites, multiple cohorts, periods, and coefficient restrictions consistent with both the data and models in which differences in mate availability can induce blacks and whites to respond in opposite directions to changes in mate availability. Results are robust to several alternative specifications and tests and appear relevant where marriages are segmented along racial, religious, <b>or</b> <b>other</b> <b>lines.</b> ...|$|R

Once the link is established, when an item is presented to the checking account that would result in an overdraft, funds are transferred from the linked account to cover the overdraft. A nominal fee is usually charged for each overdraft transfer, and if the linked account is a credit card <b>or</b> <b>other</b> <b>line</b> of credit, the consumer may be required to pay interest under the terms of that account.|$|R
