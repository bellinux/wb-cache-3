5|$|Although {{international}} agreement on staging (INSS) has been used, {{the need for}} an international consensus on risk assignment has also been recognized in order to compare similar cohorts in results of studies. Beginning in 2005, representatives of the major pediatric oncology cooperative groups have met to review data for 8,800 neuroblastoma patients treated in Europe, Japan, USA, Canada, and Australia between 1990 and 2002. This task force has proposed the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) classification system. Retrospective studies revealed the high survival rate of 12–18 month old age group, previously categorized as high-risk, and prompted the decision to reclassify 12–18 month old children without N-myc (also commonly referred to as MYCN) amplification to intermediate <b>risk</b> <b>category.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{management}} professor Peter Drucker credits Kafka {{with developing}} the first civilian hard hat while employed at the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute, {{but this is}} not supported by any document from his employer. His father often referred to his son's job as an insurance officer as a , literally [...] "bread job", a job done only to pay the bills; Kafka often claimed to despise it. Kafka was rapidly promoted and his duties included processing and investigating compensation claims, writing reports, and handling appeals from businessmen who thought their firms had been placed in too high a <b>risk</b> <b>category,</b> which cost them more in insurance premiums. He would compile and compose the annual report on the insurance institute for the several years he worked there. The reports were received well by his superiors. Kafka usually got off work at 2 p.m., so that he had time to spend on his literary work, to which he was committed. Kafka's father also expected him to help out at and take over the family fancy goods store. In his later years, Kafka's illness often prevented him from working at the insurance bureau and at his writing. Years later, Brod coined the term [...] ("The Close Prague Circle") to describe the group of writers, which included Kafka, Felix Weltsch and him.|$|E

40|$|Background Net Reclassification Indices (NRI) have {{recently}} become popular statistics {{for measuring the}} prediction increment of new biomarkers. Methods In this review, we examine {{the various types of}} NRI statistics and their correct interpretations. We evaluate {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the NRI approach. For pre-defined <b>risk</b> <b>categories,</b> we relate NRI to existing measures of the prediction increment. We also consider statistical methodology for constructing confidence intervals for NRI statistics and evaluate the merits of NRI-based hypothesis testing. Conclusions Investigators using NRI statistics should report them separately for events (cases) and nonevents (controls). When there are two <b>risk</b> <b>categories,</b> the NRI components are the same as the changes in the true and false positive rates. We advocate use of true and false positive rates and suggest it is more useful for investigators to retain the existing, descriptive terms. When there are three or more <b>risk</b> <b>categories,</b> we recommend against NRI statistics because they do not adequately account for clinically important differences in movements among <b>risk</b> <b>categories.</b> The category-free NRI is a new descriptive device designed to avoid pre-defined <b>risk</b> <b>categories.</b> The category-free NRI suffers from many of the same problems as other measures such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. In addition, the category-free NRI can mislead investigators by overstating the incremental value of a biomarker, even in independent validation data. When investigators want to test a null hypothesis of no prediction increment, the well-established tests for coefficients in the regression model are superior to the NRI. If investigators want to use NRI measures, their confidence intervals should be calculated using bootstrap methods rather than published variance formulas. The preferred single-number summary of the prediction increment is the improvement in the Net Benefit...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: to {{correlate}} classification in <b>risk</b> <b>categories</b> with the clinical profiles, outcomes and origins of patients. Method: analytical cross-sectional study conducted with 697 medical forms of adult patients. The variables included: age, sex, origin, signs and symptoms, exams, personal antecedents, classification in <b>risk</b> <b>categories,</b> medical specialties, and outcome. The Chi-square and likelihood ratio tests {{were used to}} associate classifications in <b>risk</b> <b>categories</b> with origin, signs and symptoms, exams, personal antecedents, medical specialty, and outcome. Results: most patients were women {{with an average age}} of 44. 5 years. Pain and dyspnea were the symptoms most frequently reported while hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most common comorbidities. Classifications in the green and yellow categories were the most frequent and hospital discharge the most common outcome. Patients classified in the red category presented the highest percentage of ambulance origin due to surgical reasons. Those classified in the orange and red categories also presented the highest percentage of hospitalization and death. Conclusion: correlation between clinical aspects and outcomes indicate there is a relationship between the complexity of components in the categories with greater severity, evidenced by the highest percentage of hospitalization and death...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The paper aims {{to provide}} a {{quantitative}} methodology for dealing with (true) Knightian uncertainty {{in the management of}} credit risk based on information-gap decision theory. Design/methodology/approach – Credit risk management assigns clients to credit <b>risk</b> <b>categories</b> with estimated probabilities of default for each category. Since probabilities of default are subject to uncertainty the estimated expected loss given default on a loan-book can be subject to significant uncertainty. Information-gap decision theory is applied to construct optimal loan-book portfolios that are robust against uncertainty. Findings – By choosing optimal interest-rate ratios among the credit <b>risk</b> <b>categories</b> one can simultaneously satisfy regulatory requirements on expected losses and an institution's aspirations on expected profits. Research limitations/implications – In the analysis presented here only defaults over specific time frames have been considered. However, performance requirements expressed in terms of defaults and profits over multiple time frames that allow for transitions of clients between credit <b>risk</b> <b>categories</b> over time could also be incorporated into an information-gap analysis. Practical implications – An additional management analysis tool for applying information-gap modeling to credit risk has been provided. Originality/value – This paper provides a new methodology for analyzing credit risk based on information-gap decision theory.

It also performs better among population subgroups where Framingham risk score does not perform well, especially young subjects, women, family history of premature coronary artery disease and ethnic differences in coronary risk. The absence of CAC is also associated with excellent prognosis, with 10 -year event rate of 1 %. Studies have also compared with other commonly used markers of cardiovascular disease risk such as Carotid intima-media thickness and highly sensitive C-reactive protein. CAC also performs better compared with carotid intima-media thickness and highly sensitive C-reactive protein in prediction of coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease events. CAC scans are associated with relatively low radiation exposure (0. 9 – 1. 1 mSv) and provide information that can be used not only for risk stratification but also can be used to track the progression of atherosclerosis and the effects of statins...|$|R
