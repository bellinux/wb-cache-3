5000|$|To {{bring out}} the best {{attributes}} of letterpress, printers must understand the capabilities and advantages of what can be a very unforgiving medium. For instance, since most letterpress equipment prints only one color at a time, printing multiple colors requires a separate press run in register with the preceding color. When offset printing arrived in the 1950s, it cost less, and made the color process easier. The inking system on letterpress equipment is the same as offset presses, posing problems for some graphics. Detailed, white (or [...] "knocked out") areas, such as small, serif type, or very fine halftone surrounded by fields of color can fill in with ink and lose definition if Rollers are not adjusted correctly. However, a skilled printer overcomes most of these problems. However, a letterpress provides the option of a wider <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> including handmade, organic, and tree-free. Letterpress printing provides a wide range of production choices. The classic feel and finish of letterpress papers takes printing back to an era of quality and craftsmanship. Even the smell of the ink, more apparent on a letterpress-printed page than with offset, may appeal to collectors.|$|E

40|$|Thesis contributed {{as part of}} {{collection}} donated by Tom Malone. Height growth patterns and site index were developed using stem analysis of four dominant or codominant trees from 64 plots located in 50 year-old plus, natural, fully stocked, even-aged stands of paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) in Interior and Southcentral Alaska. Observed height-over-age data were modeled using the Chapman-Richards nonlinear growth model. Plots were grouped into five site quality classes based on tree height at breast-height age of 50 years. Polymorphic site index curves were developed from the data. The families of curves indicate different height growth patterns (polymorphism). Comparison of existing Alaskan anamorphic site index curves with the polymorphic site index curves developed in this study demonstrates differences in predicted heights {{at different levels of}} site quality. The polymorphic site index curves developed in this study should replace existing anamorphic curves since they represent a more accurate pattern of height growth for the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> birch in Alaska...|$|E

For the entire <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> rank r, we fit each c_i(r) to a common distribution function that is parameterized by two scaling exponents.

40|$|Up {{until the}} mid twentieth century the Water of Leith was an {{important}} industrial centre for Edinburgh, particularly in papermaking. At the height of industrial production there were 76 mills at work along this 24 -mile stretch of river; many of those mills were papermills undertaking a range of production activities. These mills were {{at the heart of}} the communities along the Water of Leith, with most employees coming from the local area and many living in mill housing provided by the firms. This book examines the papermaking industry on the Water of Leith during the twentieth century, from before the Second World War through to the closure of the last mill in the 1989. It focuses on what it was like to work in the mills, the technological change and innovations in papermaking that occurred in these mills, the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> and paper products produced in the Water of Leith area, how the mills shaped the communities along the river, and the effects on community life caused by the subsequent demise of the industr...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} work {{carried out by}} me in the Preservation Services Branch of the National Library of Australia during the period 1983 to early 1984. Conservation activities at the Library are organised in three broad categories, with the following goals:. preparation for exhibitions. ongoing full conservation of the Library collections, in a staged process. methods development and materials investigation. The internship program was devised to allow time to be spent {{in each of these}} three areas. The amount of time spent in each area roughly reflected the allocation of conservation staff resources to each section at that time. In the exhibitions program, objects were prepared for display at the National Gallery of Australia. These included watercolours and hand-coloured prints. Under the ongoing conservation program, a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> objects were treated. Objects from the Library's Special Collections are treated in order of priority determined by Librarian staff. Works treated included newspapers, both bound and unbound, movie posters, and magazines. Work in the third area involved both routine testing method's of conservation materials, involvement in a phase preservation project, and investigations into new methods of preventive conservation...|$|E
40|$|In {{the period}} of {{reconstruction}} following World War II, designer Frederick Ward {{was concerned about the}} lack of affordable modern furniture for working and lower middle class Australians with which to furnish their small suburban houses and apartments. Limited investment capital, shortages of materials and of labour, had impacted on Australia’s early post-war production of consumer goods, and high tariffs made imports expensive. Ward’s experience in designing moderately priced furniture in the 1930 s and in managing the construction of aircraft by an inexperienced workforce during the war, led {{to the idea of a}} <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> patterns. Available by mail order through Australian Home Beautiful from 1947, Patterncraft furniture could be made with basic skills, using common materials and a limited set of tools. Ward developed a subsequent innovation of furniture kits called Timber-pack, comprising pre-cut pieces ready to glue and assemble, further stimulating the widespread enthusiasm for DIY furniture construction among people with limited skills or without access to timber. The Patterncraft system and furniture packs helped Australians furnish their modest homes with objects they had made themselves, avoiding debt, and constituting a unique effort by a designer at responding to social need while gaining a modest economic benefit.

40|$|In {{the period}} of {{reconstruction}} that followed World War 11, record numbers of Australians set up home together and yet they did so in difficult circumstances. There were shortages {{of all kinds of}} materials, of labour and limited investment capital, all of which slowed the pace of the conversion from wartime manufacturing to the production of consumer goods. Melbourne designer Fred Ward devised a solution to the lack of affordable modern furniture that made use of skills servicemen and civilians had acquired during the war, it was the Patterncraft <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> patterns, available by mail order through Australian Home Beautiful magazine from 1947. Ward had designed affordable modernist furniture in ‘native’ timbers for Myer Emporium that successfully addressed the middle class market from the mid 1930 s. His work of rendering plans for the construction of Mosquitoes and Beaufighters by swiftly trained non-specialists during the war and his connection with Keith Murdoch and Australian Home Beautiful provided the basis for the national success of the Patterncraft. A subsequent innovation of furniture kits (packs) was a paradigm shift for the furniture industry and stimulated a widespread enthusiasm for DIY furniture construction in Australia, sanctioned by this leading designer and the popular taste-making publication, Australian Home Beautiful...|$|E
