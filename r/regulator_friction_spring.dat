These nonlinearities need to be to estimated either for better control or to use the parameters for diagnosis of the system.

This thesis considers recursive grey-box identification for a nonlinear model of the transmission in an industrial robot. The nonlinearities that are identified are <b>friction,</b> <b>spring</b> stiffnes, hysteresis and backlash. These nonlinearities {{are a part of the}} models that are presented in this thesis.

The models and algorithms presented in this thesis work in a principle point of view. Despite this they work in varying extent for the different types of parameters. Estimation of linear and nonlinear <b>friction</b> and linear <b>spring</b> stiffnes works relatively well. Nonlinear spring stiffnes and hysteresis have not been possible to estimate.

The freecoaster is a {{mechanism}} found in the rear hub of a bicycle which allows a bicycle to roll backwards without the bikes' pedals having to move along with it.

Currently the mechanism that performs this action is accomplished through an unreliable <b>friction</b> <b>spring,</b> coupled with a cone and driver.

Though a significant improvement over the extractor of the Model 1865 Springfield Rifle, the Model 1866 extractor was still excessively complicated and the extractor spring somewhat prone to breakage. However, it is a misconception that a broken extractor disabled the weapon. In the official 1867 government user booklet “Description and Rules for the Management of the Springfield Breech-Loading Rifle Musket, Model 1866”, the following is stated regarding a broken extractor and/or ejector: “It should be understood that the ejector and <b>friction</b> <b>springs</b> are convenient rather than necessary, and that the piece is not necessarily disabled if {{one or both of}} them should break, for the shell can be easily removed by the fingers after being loosened by the extractor hook.” Furthermore, the “ramrod” of the rifle can be used quite effectively to remove a stuck case in an emergency.

40|$|Background and Purpose: During {{minimally}} invasive procedures, an assistant controls {{the camera and}} often a laparoscopic grasper. Ideally, the surgeon {{should be able to}} manipulate the instruments because the indirect way of control complicates the surgeon's observation and actions and disturbs eye-hand coordination. Reported replacements for the assistant are active positioners, "robots," such as the Aesop 9 ̆ 9 and the EndoAssist 9 ̆ 9. Because positioning instruments is often a static task, the Academic Medical Center has developed a passive assistant for instrument positioning (PASSIST) to allow solo surgery. Methods: The PASSIST was designed to be simple, fully autoclavable, slender, and stiff. The joints have adjustable <b>friction</b> and <b>spring</b> compensation for stabilizing the instrument in a fixed position, enabling intuitive single-hand repositioning. Results: The PASSIST has been tested in three laparoscopic procedures: cholecystectomy, laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy, and spondylodesis. In all of these procedures, the assistant could be replaced satisfactorily, and the surgeon was able to manipulate all of the instruments on his own. Conclusion: Solo surgery using the PASSIST is feasible. The positioner enables the surgeon to manipulate the viewpoint, to have a stable image, and therefore to improve observation and manipulating actions.

40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2003 A {{conventional}} {{muzzle brake}} is a baffle device located at some distance {{in front of}} the muzzle exit of a gun. The purpose of a muzzle brake is to alleviate the force on the weapon platform by diverting a portion of the muzzle gas resulting in a forward impulse being exerted on the recoiling parts of the weapon. A very efficient muzzle brake unfortunately gives rise to an excessive overpressure in the crew environment due to the deflection of the emerging shock waves. The novel active muzzle brake of this dissertation is based on a concept developed by Qinetiq. The novel technique involves the main brake chamber being closed for {{a very short period of}} time after the projectile has uncorked from the barrel eliminating the main emerging shock wave from developing to full strength with the result that the novel muzzle brake gives rise to a very low overpressure. This has the advantage that the gun crew suffers from less strain to the ears and vulnerable organs. Inherently the novel brake suffers a loss in efficiency due to the chamber being closed for a while and a method had to be developed to improve the efficiency of the conventional part. This dissertation deals with the development of a novel active muzzle brake intended for a 155 mm artillery weapon, but scaled to an 88 mm 25 pounder G 1 as an interim phase. Several constraints and requirements have been set regarding the physical properties and performance criteria of the prototypes. The interim phase of the project was executed within three years in which six prototypes were developed and evaluated. Major challenges in the development were to design a control and restoring mechanism that would survive the harsh conditions at muzzle exit and to enhance the efficiency. The establishment of linear movement of the closure mechanism and <b>friction</b> <b>springs</b> as the restoring mechanism was a major breakthrough in this respect. The first four prototypes were designed using empirical data and first order modeling as background while a CFD technique was used to refine the last two prototypes. Of the six prototypes developed, the first two were unsuccessful in demonstrating the novel technique. The one was unable to survive the muzzle exit conditions and the control mechanism on the second muzzle brake opened too soon. Of the remaining four, the last prototype passed all the specified constraints and proved to be a candidate for the 155 mm upgrade. Not only was the structure robust enough, the general appearance of the novel muzzle brake is futuristic. This prototype is also a candidate if a much more efficient muzzle brake, with similar overpressure characteristics of a less efficient muzzle brake, is needed. Master...|$|R
