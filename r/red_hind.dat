60|$|There is in La Plata a large {{handsome}} grasshopper (Zoniopoda tarsata), {{the habits}} of which in its larva and imago stages are in strange contrast, like those in certain lepidoptera, in which the caterpillars form societies and act in concert. The adult has a greenish protective colouring, brown and green banded thighs, bright <b>red</b> <b>hind</b> wings, seen only during flight. It is solitary and excessively shy in its habits, living always in concealment among the dense foliage near {{the surface of the}} ground. The yonng are intensely black, like grasshoppers cut out of jet or ebony, and gregarious in habit, living in bands of forty or fifty to three or four hundred; and so little shy, that they may sometimes be taken up by handfuls before they begin to scatter in alarm. Their gregarious habits and blackness--of all hues in nature the most obvious to the sight--would alone be enough to make them the most conspicuous of insects; but they have still other habits which appear as if specially designed to bring them more prominently into notice. Thus, they all keep so close together at all times as to have their bodies actually touching, and when travelling, move so slowly that the laziest snail might easily overtake and pass one of their bands, and even disappear beyond their limited horizon in a very short time.|$|E

40|$|Acoustic cues {{present in}} the {{reproductive}} calls of many animal species potentially encode important information about the caller. Here, we test the response of a free-ranging population of peri-oestrus <b>red</b> deer <b>hinds</b> to variation in a specific acoustic cue to body size in the male roar, the formant frequencies. Our results revealed: (1) that hinds showed greater overall attention (judged by longer looking responses and lower response latencies) to roars simulating males of sub-adult body size than to those simulating a large adult male and (2) that hinds without dependent off- spring had greater looking responses to male roars and lower response latencies than hinds with dependent offspring to roars simulating sub- adult males. These findings indicate that free-ranging <b>red</b> deer <b>hinds</b> may use formants as acoustic cues to gauge the body size and maturity of males in their natural environment, possibly to facilitate earlier detection and avoidance of young stags that are known to harass them...|$|R

40|$|Mating signals can be {{used both}} in {{contexts}} of species recognition and mate quality assessment. This study examines species recognition abilities in oestrous females presented with male mating calls from both conspecifics and closely related allopatric heterospecifics. Red deer and sika deer are naturally allopatric polygynous species capable of hybridization during sympatry. Male mating calls are sexually selected and differ greatly between species. Previous work indicated that most but not all oestrous <b>red</b> deer <b>hinds</b> prefer male mating calls from conspecifics over heterospecific sika deer. Using two-speaker playback experiments, we extend this examination by measuring the preference responses of oestrous sika deer hinds to these stimuli. We predicted that oestrous sika deer hinds will show little flexibility in behavioural responses and prefer conspecific calls over heterospecific calls, {{similar to those of}} <b>red</b> deer <b>hinds.</b> In contrast, sika deer hinds showed high levels of flexibility and no difference in overall preference behaviours, suggesting that vocal behaviour does not provide a solid barrier to hybridization in this species. The asymmetry in heterospecific preference responses between these species is discussed in relation to possible causation and hybridization patterns observed in free-ranging populations...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine whether do-paminergic or opioidergic pathways are modulated by thyroid gland secretions for seasonal suppression of LH secretion in <b>red</b> deer <b>hinds.</b> Ovariectomized (n 5 5) or ovariectomized and thy-roidectomized (n 5 4) hinds, treated with estradiol implants, received the dopamine agonist bromocriptine or the antagonist sulpiride during pulse bleeds in July (breeding season) and Oc-tober (nonbreeding season). Comparison of July and October mean plasma LH concentration (3. 5 6 1. 3, 0. 7 6 0. 1 ng/ml, respectively), pulse frequency (1. 9 6 0. 4, 0. 7 6 0. 2 pulses/ 4 h), and pulse amplitude (1. 3 6 0. 5, 0. 7 6 0. 02 ng/ml) showed low-er (p, 0. 05) levels in October, and these levels were not sig-nificantly affected by thyroidectomy or drug treatment. In the absence of estradiol implants, the hinds received bromocriptine or morphine during the breeding season (July) and their antag-onists, sulpiride or naloxone, respectively, in the nonbreeding season (November). In euthyroid hinds there was a seasonal de-crease (p, 0. 05) in mean plasma LH concentration, pulse fre-quency, and pulse amplitude, which did not occur in thyroidec-tomized hinds. There were no effects of drug treatment on LH concentration except for a small increase following sulpiride in November. Plasma prolactin concentration was significantly in-creased by antagonists and decreased by agonists on most oc-casions. We conclude that in <b>red</b> deer <b>hinds,</b> seasonal regulation of LH secretion does not involve dopamine or endogenous opioids and the thyroid gland is required specifically for LH sup-pression {{in the absence of}} estradiol...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to compare estradiol/progesterone ratios of different age categories of <b>red</b> deer <b>hinds</b> and use it as a predictor of estrus synchronization success and consequently conception rate. To accomplish this we used 38 <b>red</b> deer <b>hinds</b> to establish serum progesterone and estradiol levels in young (21 animals), mature (10 animals) and old (7 animals) hinds during the estrus synchronization procedure (transvaginal/cervical AI). The following estrus synchronization was used: at the start of the experiment each hind received a controlled intravaginal drug-releasing device (CIDR, Pharmacia&Upjohn, New Zealand) containing 0. 3 g of progesterone. The device was removed on day 11, simultaneously with an application of 250 IU of Pregnant Mare Serum Gonadotropin (PMSG, Folligon® Intervet International, Boxmeer, Holland). Transvaginal/ cervical AI (artificial insemination) was performed 48 hours after CIDR withdrawal (day 13). Blood samples were obtained from the jugular vein using a Venoject® vacutainer without an anticoagulant for hormonal tests on the same experimental day (0, 11 th and 13 th day). A statistically (p< 0. 01) higher progesterone level was found in young hinds on the 11 th day after controlled intravaginal drug-releasing device insertion. A significantly higher (p< 0. 01) estrogen level was observed in the young in regard to mature and old hinds on the expected day of estrus (13 th day). Estradiol/progesterone ratios showed a statistically significant difference (p< 0. 01) on insemination day (13 th day) between old and young hinds (98. 67 : 46. 59) and between old and mature hinds (98. 67 : 51. 79).

40|$|Four {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to investigate factors controlling the seasonal onset of reproductive activity in <b>red</b> deer <b>hinds.</b> Firstly (Chapter 4), the role of photorefractoriness to long daily photoperiods in the initiation of the seasonal reproductive activity in breeding <b>red</b> deer <b>hinds</b> was examined. Red deer hinds (n= 10) were prematurely exposed to a long daily photoperiod of 15. 3 h from 22 July to 8 November 1986 i. e. winter-spring (EPW), or maintained under natural photoperiods (NP). Six hinds experienced the natural changes in daily photoperiod until mid-summer but were exposed to a 15. 5 h of light each day from 30 January to 30 April 1987, i. e. summer-autumn (EPS), whilst hinds in the other groups experienced naturally decreasing daily photoperiods. On 5 occasions (July 1986, January, February, March and April 1987), blood samples were collected from 4 NP and 4 EPW hinds every 20 minutes for 4 h to monitor secretion of luteinising hormone and half hourly for another 4 h following an i. v. injection of 2 µg GnRH to measure pituitary responsiveness. In January, March and April 1987 EPS hinds were also intensively sampled for 4 h. Plasma progesterone concentrations and mean date of calving indicated that the onset of breeding activity was not affected by light treatment in the EPW hinds but was delayed by 3 weeks in the EPS hinds. In contrast, supplementary lighting caused a premature elevation of plasma prolactin concentrations and advanced pelage moulting in EPW hinds only. Plasma LH secretion patterns indicated that LH pulse frequency and mean LH concentrations were greater during the breeding season than during pregnancy or, seasonal or postpartum, anoestrus. The reduction in LH secretion was partially explained by a diminished pituitary responsiveness to GnRH. Daily plasma melatonin secretion patterns indicated that {{the duration of the}} nocturnal increase in melatonin concentrations was responsive to changes in photoperiod and provided a suitable endocrine signal for measuring day length. The results suggest that, unlike the sheep and prepubertal <b>red</b> deer <b>hind,</b> the onset of seasonal breeding activity in breeding <b>red</b> deer <b>hinds</b> is not affected by long daily photoperiods in spring but is delayed if the autumnal decrease in daily photoperiod is delayed. Therefore neither the development of photorefractoriness nor the spring increase in daily photoperiods initiated the transition from seasonal anoestrus to reproductive activity in the breeding hind. However, long daily photoperiods may have entrained the annual cycle of pelage shedding and prolactin secretion. It is possible that the neuroendocrine pathway by which photoperiodic signals entrain the seasonal cycle of reproduction is separate from those which regulate other seasonal events in the breeding <b>red</b> deer <b>hind.</b> Secondly (Chapter 5), in a study of seasonality of reproduction, 4 pubertal hinds were monitored for live weight and plasma LH and progesterone concentrations from December 1987 to October 1988 (i. e. 12 - 22 months of age). In addition the pattern of LH secretion was also studied in 4 ovariectomised pubertal hinds implanted s. c. with controlled release implants containing 12 mg oestradiol- 17 β between 4 March and 25 May and between 15 June and 19 September, 1988. On several occasions (15 December, 29 February, 15 March, 24 April, 14 June, 29 June, 18 September (all hinds) and 3 October (ovariectomised hinds only) blood samples were collected every 20 minutes for 4 h to monitor secretion of luteinising hormone and following an i. v. injection of 2 µg GnRH to measure pituitary responsiveness. Plasma progesterone profiles indicated that 4 - 6 ovarian cycles, lasting about 19 d each, occurred in each intact hind. Regular ovarian cycles commenced in late April (26 April ± 3. 4 d, mean ± s. e. m.) and ceased 3 months later in July (21 July ± 7. 2 d). The number of LH pulses in the intact hinds was higher in June (1 - 2 pulses/ 4 h) than in the non-breeding season (< 1 pulse/ 4 h) probably due to a seasonal increase in GnRH secretion. It appears that the seasonal increase in LH pulsatility and onset of reproductive activity in the entire hinds were temporally related to a reduction in the sensitivity of LH secretion to the negative feedback effects of oestradiol in ovariectomised pubertal hinds. In the third trial (Chapter 6), 20 male and 20 female red deer calves were immunised at birth against a melatonin conjugate or injected with adjuvant only (controls). Booster injections were given on 5 occasions over the next 2 years. Stags which produced significant melatonin binding activity in response to immunisation, were heavier than the controls between 7 and 11 months of age and at 16, 20, 30 and 34 months of age. A similar but smaller effect on live weight was seen in the immunised hinds. Immunisation against melatonin did not affect the calving date of the hinds or antler development and time of casting of antlers in the stags. These results indicated that disruption of the photoperiodic signal by immunisation against melatonin may have prevented the entrainment of annual rhythms in feed intake and growth but without affecting the seasonal cycles in antler growth and ovarian activity. Finally in a series of 3 trials (Chapter 7), anoestrous <b>red</b> deer <b>hinds</b> were induced to ovulate with the GnRH analogue, buserelin. Hinds were pre-treated with intravaginal devices containing 0. 6 g progesterone (CIDR-Type S) for 14 days prior to CIDR withdrawal on 4 March. In Year 1, 15 hinds were treated with 1 CIDR each and 8 hinds were injected i. m. with 4 µg buserelin (a GnRH analogue) at CIDR removal followed by 2 nd injection of 10 µg 48 h later. In Year 2, 16 hinds were treated with 2 CIDRs each and 8 hinds were injected Lm. with 4, 3, 2, 2 and 10 µg buserelin at - 48, - 24, 0, 24 and 48 h respectively from CIDR withdrawal. In Year 3, 15 hinds were treated with 2 CIDRs and 11 hinds (Groups Band BO) injected with buserelin identical to the protocol in Year 2. At CIDR withdrawal 6 of these buserelin treated hinds (Group BO) and 4 other progesterone-primed hinds (Group 0) were injected with 500 µg oestradiol benzoate. In addition, during the breeding season, 4 hinds (Group C) were treated with double CIDRs only for 14 d from 1 April. When oestrous behaviour and the pattern of plasma LH secretion were monitored in Year 3, oestrous behaviour was less noticeable and delayed in Group B hinds and peak LH levels were lower and increased later relative to Group 0, BO and C hinds. Two weeks after CIDR withdrawal, 6 buserelin-treated hinds in both Year 1 and Year 2, and 3 / 5 B, 2 / 4 0, 3 / 6 BO and 4 / 4 C group hinds in Year 3 had a single corpus luteum present. Plasma progesterone concentrations were elevated for about 12 d in most hinds with a corpus luteum in Year 2 and in most B, BO and C Group hinds in Year 3. However, progesterone secretion was low in several Year 1 and all Group 0 hinds in Year 3 indicating that the induced corpora lutea in these hinds were functionally subnormal. There was no evidence that any of the buserelin-induced ovulations resulted in pregnancy, probably because the induced ovulations were not accompanied by normal hormonal and behavioural patterns.
