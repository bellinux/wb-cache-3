25|$|Noun phrase {{morphology}} is agglutinative and {{consists of}} suffixes which simply attach {{to the end of}} a stem. These suffixes are in many cases fused with the article (-a for singular and -ak for plural), which in general is required to close a noun phrase in Basque if no other determiner is present, and unlike an article in many languages, it can only partially be correlated with the concept of definiteness. Proper nouns do not take an article, and indefinite nouns without the article (called mugagabe in Basque grammar) are highly restricted syntactically. Basque is an ergative language, meaning that inflectionally the single argument (subject) of an intransitive verb is marked in the same way as the direct object of a transitive verb. This is called the absolutive case and in Basque, as in most ergative languages, it is <b>realized</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> zero morph; in other words, it receives no special inflection. The subject of a transitive verb receives a special case suffix, called the ergative case.|$|E
500|$|The episode's prison {{setting was}} <b>realized</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mixture of {{location}} filming at a real prison, and constructed sets. The first scene shot for the episode was the heart-to-heart between Johnson and May. As big fans of Stephen King, the writers had the character Santino read a Spanish version of King's book Pet Sematary while in his jail cell. For the prop of the Darkhold, introduced in this episode, Lilla {{suggested that the}} book's cover should feature the word [...] "Darkhold" [...] as an , with the series' props department designing a new font to achieve this. The prop department had two weeks to create the book before it was needed for filming the episode, with the final book assembled by a bookbinder using aged, vellum pages that were filled with text and illustrations inspired by Leonardo DaVinci's Vitruvian Man.|$|E

2500|$|In 1984, New York City hired {{physicist}} Alan J. Friedman to {{help with}} the museum's transition from a focus on science fiction to relevance to everyday lives of ordinary citizens. At the time Friedman was appointed, the museum was basically an empty shell, having [...] "an inch of water on the floor. All the exhibits had been given away. Even the light fixtures had been yanked out of the wall”, but renovations continued. After it reopened in 1986, giving New York City a science museum {{for the first time since}} it had closed seven years earlier, plans for the display of an atom were <b>realized</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> $40,000 exhibit for a quantum atom that was a part of a $400,000 expansion and renovation at the museum. The museum's growth and ability to draw crowds was unexpected and led to the city's pursuit of further funds and expansion.|$|E

40|$|The {{presented}} paper {{includes the}} design and implementation of a 65 nm CMOS low-noise amplifier (LNA) based on inductive source degeneration. The amplifier is <b>realized</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> active balun enabling a single-ended input which is an important requirement for low-cost system on chip implementations. The LNA has a tunable bandpass characteristics from 4. 7 GHz up to 5. 6 GHz and a continuously tunable gain from 22 dB down to 0 dB, which enables the required flexibility for multi-standard, multi-band receiver architectures. The gain and band tuning is <b>realized</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> optimized tunable active resistor in parallel to a tunable L-C tank amplifier load. The amplifier achieves an IIP 3 linearity of - 8 dBm and a noise figure of 2. 7 dB at the highest gain and frequency setting <b>with</b> <b>a</b> low power consumption of 10 mW. The high flexibility of the proposed LNA structure together with the overall good performance makes it well suited for future multi-standard low-cost receiver front-ends...|$|R
