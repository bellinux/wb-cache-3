Several items Karobes developed and successfully marketed like carpets, reclining seats or head and back rests were later adopted by car manufacturers and not sold separately. The company's catalogues in the early 1970s offered {{a wide range of}} products, from heel pads (for high-heels) to spotlight hoods, steering wheel gloves, vinyl <b>roof</b> <b>kits</b> and wiper attachments. One of the company's inventors, Leslie Morrison Keegan, filed several patents for head rests and seat covers in the late 1950s, for example ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of thermal insulation materials in roof applications {{is affected by}} the thermal impact of solar radiation. This is particularly true for flat roofs where the insulation material is applied directly under a water-proof membrane. The two most important aspects of this application are: • The high temperature levels due to solar radiation; • The significant temperature variations during the different periods of the day and of the year. This research study examined the temperature spread inside a water proof kit and in particular the maximum temperatures that can be reached in the insulation layer. The research study consisted of two phases: • Modelling: Using a calculation model, the temperature gradient was calculated for all the different layers of a typical water-proof kit configuration simulating the possible variation of several climatic parameters. • Practical validation: the real conditions on two different roofs were measured to proof the validity of the model. The study results showed that the insulation layer in contact with the external water-proof membrane of flat roofs can reach temperature peaks of more than 70 °C during the period of highest solar radiation. In the hot Mediterranean climate of southern Europe, temperatures can reach 80 °C. The maximum temperatures on curved roofs in more moderate climate zones can reach 67 °C. The project showed daily temperature variations of close to 40 °K inside the insulation material and about 50 °K on the surface. These temperature peaks exceed the maximum functional temperatures of several insulation materials. With a view to guaranteeing the quality and durability of <b>roof</b> <b>kits,</b> specifiers and architects should be aware of how high temperature levels reached in zones of intensive solar radiation affect the dimensional stability of insulation material...|$|E

50|$|The Doctor {{intercepts}} {{a police}} transmission and sends {{his men to}} ambush the helicopter. Helen manages to warn Kit, who rams the helicopter into the building. In the resulting chaos everyone escapes, but the Doctor captures Helen and takes her to the <b>roof.</b> <b>Kit</b> finds Helen with a bomb strapped to her, and the Doctor taunts him to choose between taking revenge on him or saving the life of another loved one. Kit throws a knife, hitting the Doctor in the shoulder before the latter escapes. Kit finds out that the wiring {{is the same as}} the last bomb, and this time successfully defuses it. A few seconds later, he gets a call from the Doctor. Kit informs the Doctor that the dagger he threw was smeared with snake venom from Helen's wound, and the Doctor dies in agony.|$|R

60|$|It {{was some}} {{gratification}} to Mr Quilp to find, {{as he took}} his place upon the <b>roof,</b> that <b>Kit's</b> mother was alone inside; from which circumstance he derived {{in the course of}} the journey much cheerfulness of spirit, inasmuch as her solitary condition enabled him to terrify her with many extraordinary annoyances; such as hanging over the side of the coach at the risk of his life, and staring in with his great goggle eyes, which seemed in hers the more horrible from his face being upside down; dodging her in this way from one window to another; getting nimbly down whenever they changed horses and thrusting his head in at the window with a dismal squint: which ingenious tortures had such an effect upon Mrs Nubbles, that she was quite unable for the time to resist the belief that Mr Quilp did in his own person represent and embody that Evil Power, who was so vigorously attacked at Little Bethel, and who, by reason of her backslidings in respect of Astley's and oysters, was now frolicsome and rampant.|$|R

Bangladesh Red Crescent Society initially asked 400 million Taka (US$5,807,594) to the international community. As part of the Bangladeshi cricket team's tour in New Zealand, a charity Twenty20 match was held with all funds raised going to the victims. In addition, the International Cricket Council donated US$250,000 to the funds {{at the start of}} the match. The Ministry of Food and Disaster Management allocated 4,000 metric tonnes of rice, 7,500 tents, 18,000 blankets, and 30 million Taka (US$435,569) in relief grants. About 13,000 housing packages, consisting of iron sheets for <b>roofing</b> and family <b>kits</b> were prepared for immediate distribution. A special 350 million Taka (US$5,081,645) fund for housing was established by November 22, 2007. At that time, 732 medical teams were deployed to the affected areas.|$|R
40|$|Bioclimatic {{design is}} an {{effective}} architectural approach for creating environmentally responsive buildings, improving comfort {{and quality of life}} for its users while using fewer resources. However, globalization of construction strategies and standardized systems are often applied to various locations without considering the specificity of each climate and site. Thus, working contrary to bioclimatic premises and reducing the overall building performance. This work analyzes the case of the One-Day Church (ODC) global project from Maranatha Volunteers International (MVI), which consists of building churches around the world using a standard <b>roof</b> and frame <b>kit,</b> and local materials. It proposes design improvements for three macro-climates, namely hot-humid, hot-arid, and temperate. This study reviews the concepts of environmental design for each climate and takes into consideration the organization values and church architecture for this religious group. The baseline model and proposed changes are simulated, and the results show that the strategies were responsible for improving daylighting levels, natural ventilation, envelope performance, and overall hours of comfort. In conclusion, applying a set of variations on the design based on macro-climate requirements can significantly improve the environmental performance of one-size-fits-all designs, creating a better space for those building users. These bioclimatic strategies may be applied to other standardized construction projects, such as emergency shelters, and in general to demonstrate the benefits of a bioclimatic approach...|$|R
40|$|As I {{near the}} {{completion}} of my undergraduate degree in Architecture, I am often asked if architecture is my future. I typically reply, "I don't know," and then continue with, "what I {{really need to do}} is design and build something — no bigger than a shed, and I think that will be the litmus test for my future as an architect or designer. " I sense the need to move from 1 / 8 " = 1 '- 0 " to 1 " = 1 ". The full-scale world is all I am concerned with. It is a world that was utterly neglected in my studies as an architecture student. Last autumn, alongside my Dad and a family friend, I helped assemble a Sears backyard shed that came as a kit of parts waiting to be formed into floors, walls and a <b>roof.</b> This particular <b>kit</b> of parts must have sat in our garage for over a year, but the pieces went up willingly enough, as it was only daylong project. Having followed the directions and making sure the end result looked as the diagrams indicated, we assumed we now had a shed to last. But, Kalamazoo — where my parents reside — is accustomed to regular snowfall in the winter months. The Sears shed must not have been designed for such regular snowfall, because within three months of assembling the shed, nature disassembled it, collapsing the roof {{under the weight of the}} snow. My opportunity had arrived. The following is a log documenting the construction of a new backyard shed. For most, a humble project; for me, a project infused with sentiment and introspection, concepts of beauty and ethics, and a chance to turn from a critic to a creator. Oh, to most who ever see this shed it will appear as nothing more than any familiar organization of brick and metal, a proper orientation of walls and a roof - nothing to even mark a memory in one's mind. But, I don't build for them. Honors College"December 13, 2010. "Thesis (B. ?. ...|$|R
