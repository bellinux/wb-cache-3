The paper presents the optimal <b>receding</b> horizon filtering equations.

This result could be a theoretical basis for the optimal control in nonlinear stochastic systems with incomplete information over the most recent time interval.

40|$|International audienceIn this article, we {{consider}} a <b>receding</b> horizon control of discrete-time state-dependent jump linear systems, {{a particular kind}} of stochastic switching systems, subject to possibly unbounded random disturbances and probabilistic state constraints. Due {{to the nature of the}} dynamical system and the constraints, {{we consider}} a one-step <b>receding</b> horizon. Using inverse cumulative distribution function, we convert the probabilistic state constraints to deterministic constraints, and obtain a tractable deterministic <b>receding</b> horizon control problem. We consider the <b>receding</b> horizon control law to have a linear state-feedback and an admissible offset term. We ensure mean square boundedness of the state variable via solving linear matrix inequalities off-line, and solve the <b>receding</b> horizon control problem on-line with control offset terms. We illustrate the overall approach applied on a macroeconomic system...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of crossmodal dynamic visual capture {{occurs when the}} direction of motion of a visual cue causes a weakening or reversal of the perceived direction of motion of a concurrently presented auditory stimulus. It is known {{that there is a}} perceptual bias towards looming compared to <b>receding</b> stimuli, and faster bimodal reaction times have recently been observed for looming cues compared to <b>receding</b> cues (Cappe et al., 2009). The current studies aimed to test whether visual looming cues are associated with greater dynamic capture of auditory motion in depth compared to <b>receding</b> signals. Participants judged the direction of an auditory motion cue presented with a visual looming cue (expanding disk), a visual <b>receding</b> cue (contracting disk), or visual stationary cue (static disk). Visual cues were presented either simultaneously with the auditory cue, or after 500 ms. We found increased levels of interference with looming visual cues compared to <b>receding</b> visual cues, compared to asynchronous presentation or stationary visual cues. The results could not be explained by the weaker subjective strength of the <b>receding</b> auditory stimulus, as in Experiment 2 the looming and <b>receding</b> auditory cues were matched for perceived strength. These results show that dynamic visual capture of auditory motion in the depth plane is modulated by an adaptive bias for looming compared to <b>receding</b> visual cues...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the design of}} a dynamic state feedback <b>receding</b> horizon controller, which guarantees robust constraint satisfaction, robust stability and offset-free control of constrained linear systems in the presence of time-varying setpoints and unmeasured disturbances. This objective is obtained by first designing a dynamic linear offset-free controller and computing an appropriate domain of attraction for this controller. The linear (unconstrained) controller is then modified by adding a perturbation term, which is computed by a (constrained) robust <b>receding</b> horizon controller. The <b>receding</b> horizon controller has the property that its domain of attraction contains that of the linear controller. In order to ensure robust constraint satisfaction, in addition to offset-free control, the transient as well as the limiting behavior of the disturbance and setpoint need {{to be taken into account}} in the design of the <b>receding</b> horizon controller. The fundamental difference between the results in this paper and the existing literature on <b>receding</b> horizon control is that, in this paper, the transient effect of the disturbance and setpoint sequences on the so-called “target calculator ” is explicitly incorporated in the formulation of the <b>receding</b> horizon controller.
