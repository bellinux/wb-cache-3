40|$|Background: Preeclampsia is {{of major}} {{complications}} of pregnancy that {{is associated with}} maternal morbidity and mortality. Therefore, prediction and early diagnosis of preeclampsia would be helpful for better controlling of related complications. Our study aimed to investigate risk factors helping to predict and early diagnose of preeclampsia. Materials and Methods: A total of 739 nulliparous women at their 24 - 28 th weeks of the first pregnancy were enrolled in this multi-center cohort study. Incidence or absence of preeclampsia in this population was evaluated up to the end of pregnancy period. For each case, a record sheet was assigned that contained information about haematocrit level in weeks 24 - 28 th of pregnancy, blood pressure, result of <b>roll-over</b> <b>test</b> in weeks 24 - 28 th of pregnancy and the presence of disease up to end of the study. Diagnosis of preeclampsia was made based on gold standard. Results : Overall, 3. 9 % of all cases developed preeclampsia. The mean maternal age, body mass index (BMI), years of education and positive <b>roll-over</b> <b>test</b> were significantly higher in preeclampsia group (P < 0. 001). However, the mean gestational age and changes in the levels of haematocrit were significantly higher in normotensive cases (P < 0. 001). Our combined model could predict preeclampsia with a sensitivity of 93 % and a specificity of 80 %. Conclusion: Simple combined model of demographic characteristics including maternal age, BMI, years of education and positive roll-over tests can predict preeclampsia without any cost for the patients...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE:To {{determine}} the <b>roll-over</b> <b>test</b> (ROT) performance in predicting pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) in primigravidae aged 15 - 29 {{years in a}} public primary care service. METHOD: Prospective cohort study enrolling 369 consecutive and initially normotensive primigravidae. The ROT was applied within 28 - 32 weeks of pregnancy. PIH was defined as diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 90 mm Hg or systolic blood pressure (SBP) 140 mm Hg, or a rise in DBP 15 mm Hg or a rise in SBP 30 mm Hg. The ROT prognostic properties were calculated, and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed. RESULTS: For the 20 mm Hg cutoff point, sensitivity was 20 % and specificity was 93 %. Positive and negative predictive values were, respectively, 23 % and 92 %, for a PIH cumulative incidence of 9. 5 %. With other cutoff points, the ROC curve showed a poor discriminatory value of the test. CONCLUSION: The ROT was not useful for predicting PIH in a primary prenatal care setting...|$|E
40|$|Object of the European project Litebus is the study, {{design and}} {{test of the}} cabin of a coach in {{composite}} materials: the cabin frame is made of composite pillars. The paper presents a study on this component, in terms of stiffness that can be offered to the global structure of the coach for the <b>roll-over</b> <b>test</b> and bus homologation according to the standards. Different pillars are taken into consideration, made of glass and carbon fibers, and with different sections. Static experimental tests are performed on these pillars, clamping at one edge and using them as cantilever beams, measuring the displacement {{as a function of}} the applied load. An analysis of the different failure modes of the pillars is also proposed. In parallel, numerical simulations are run and validated on the basis of the experimental tests. The aim of these models is to propose an interpretation of the experimental tests and to correctly define the material mechanical properties. In this way, a valid tool for a tailored design of the structure is obtained...|$|E

It features a double ring propeller guard that has been <b>roll-over</b> <b>tested.</b> The [...] fuel tank is made from aluminium. In flight steering is accomplished via foot pedals, or optionally a control stick, that actuate the canopy brakes, creating roll and yaw. On the ground the aircraft has lever-controlled nosewheel steering. The main landing gear incorporates gas strut suspension. The aircraft is factory supplied {{in the form of an}} assembly kit that requires 30-50 hours to complete.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} of pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) {{which is one}} of the three main causes of maternal-neonatal morbidity and mortality is 5 - 7 %, and prediction of this disorder is very important in maternal and neonatal health.  Methods: The type of this study is analytical (comparative-prospective) and its purpose is to evaluate the isometric exercise test (lET) and <b>roll-over</b> <b>test</b> (ROT) as methods ofPIH prediction. 116 nulliparaes, with study characteristics, after filling a questionaire and physical exam, underwent ROT, and then lET after 5 minutes, between 28 - 32 weeks of their pregnancy. The samples are followed up regularly until 24 hr after delivery in Mashad university prenatal clinics and hospitals. Statistical analysis was done by SPSS with a: 0. 05.  Results: As a result, lET has a higher validity than ROT(sensitivity: 78. 9 % vs. 47. 4 %, p< 0. 0001, specificity: 94. 80 vs. 83. 5 %,p: 0. 007,positivepredictivevalue: 75 % vs. 36 %,p: 0. 0001, negative predictive value: 95. 8 % vs. 89 %, p: 0. 046), also validity of IETandROTtogetheris: sensitivity: 85. 7 %, specificity: 96. 3 %,PPV: 66. 6 % andNPV: 98. 8 %.  Conclusion: The validity of lET in this study was shown to be higher than ROT, and by use of a very simple and cost -effective lET, we are able to predict PIH with the highest validity and if possible, use both tests in order to raise validity...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to compare uric acid, iron and TIBC levels in normal and preeclamptic pregnant women and determine their relations with maternal and fetal complications. Materials and methods: A case control {{study was conducted in}} 200 normal and preeclamptic pregnant women. At 32 - 40 weeks of pregnancy (third trimester) a blood test was taken in order to measure the uric acid, iron and TIBC and their relation with maternal and fetal complications. Results: Uric acid level showed significant difference (4. 58 &plusmn; 0. 73, 4. 87 &plusmn; 0. 58, p= 0. 002) between "ntwo groups of pre-eclamptic and normal women. &nbsp; The iron and TIBC level had no significant difference in either group. The uric acid level and iron had significant differences between two groups with and without maternal complication, respectively (4. 69 &plusmn; 0. 66, 5. 05 &plusmn; 0. 59, p&lt; 0. 05) (387. 42 &plusmn; 82, "n 405. 24 &plusmn; 57, p&lt; 0. 05). There was not any difference in three parameters between groups with and without fetal complication. The BMI was significantly higher in preeclamptic group and has positive relation with uric acid level. If we consider 29 as BMI cut-off point; it will be associated with 73 % sensitivity and 67 % specificity in preeclampsia determination. Using 4. 55 as uric acid cut-off point, "nthe sensitivity is 76 % and specificity is 49 %. Conclusion: Although the higher level of uric acid, higher BMI scale and positive <b>roll-over</b> <b>test</b> are associated with preeclampsia, but they are not very strong predictors as single test. &nbsp...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the favorable effects of multi mineralâ��Vitamin D supplementation on pregnancy outcomes among women at risk for preâ��eclampsia. Methods: This randomized doubleâ��blind controlled clinical trial was conducted among 46 women at risk for preâ��eclampsia at 27 weeksâ�� gestation with positive <b>roll-over</b> <b>test.</b> Pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive either the multi mineralâ��Vitamin D supplements (n = 23) or the placebo (n = 23) for 9 â��week. Multi mineralâ��Vitamin D supplements were containing 800 mg calcium, 200 mg magnesium, 8 mg zinc, and 400 IU Vitamin D 3. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after 9 â��week intervention to measure related factors. Newbornâ��s outcomes were determined. Results: Although no significant difference was seen in newbornâ��s weight and head circumference between the two groups, mean newbornsâ�� length (51. 3 Â± 1. 7 vs. 50. 3 Â± 1. 2 cm, P = 0. 03) was significantly higher in multi mineralâ��Vitamin D group than that in the placebo group. Compared to the placebo, consumption of multi mineralâ��Vitamin D supplements resulted in increased levels of serum calcium (+ 0. 19 vs. â�� 0. 08 mg/dL, P = 0. 03), magnesium (+ 0. 15 vs. â�� 0. 08 mg/dL, P = 0. 03), zinc (+ 8. 25 vs. â�� 21. 38 mg/dL, P = 0. 001) and Vitamin D (+ 3. 79 vs. â�� 1. 37 ng/ml, P = 0. 01). In addition, taking multi mineralâ��Vitamin D supplements favorably influenced systolic blood pressure (SBP) (â�� 1. 08 vs. 6. 08 mmHg, P = 0. 001) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (â�� 0. 44 vs. 3. 05 mmHg, P = 0. 02). Conclusions: Multi mineralâ��Vitamin D supplementation for 9 â��week in pregnant women at risk for preâ��eclampsia resulted in increased newbornâ��s length, increased circulating levels of maternal serum calcium, magnesium, zinc and Vitamin D, and led to decreased maternal SBP and DBP.
