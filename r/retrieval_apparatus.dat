40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to identify and}} demonstrate the deficiencies, suggests the reasons for them, and propose amelioration, {{in the nature of}} record retrieval services given by the state institues in Turkey. It is the contention of this study (its hypotheses) that the major deficiencies in records retrieval services are basicly by product of existing system of archival applications in these institutions that are not based on the modern tecniques and methods, The method chosen for this study is descriptive method. The data to test our hypotheses has been obtained from three official institutions by participatory observation. In conclusion, it has been observed that; - There is a casual relationship between the records retrieval and <b>retrieval</b> <b>apparatus,</b> - The methods and tecniques used, in applications are either incompatible or insuffucient, - From the viewpoint of methods and tecniques applied, the problem is condensed in preparing the means of record retrieval, in filing and in arragement, - Studies toward computerasztion is still in preparatory stage, - The institutions concerned fail to possess the organized structure and the archival system for effective record retrieval services. In order to unravel the strands in the observed inadequecies in the record retrieval services of the state institutions. This study suggests that, - An organized structure should be implemented for archives, - The modern methods andtechniques related to archives should be used in applications, - Computerised method should be preferred to manual method in order to provide economy and efficiency, in the archival applications and services...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} and evaluates a retrieval scheme, or {{more precisely}} an additional retrieval mechanism based on interdocument relationships, that can be integrated in almost all existing retrieval schemes (e. g., Boolean, hybrid Boolean, vector-processing or probabilistic models). The intent of our approach consists of inferring knowledge about document contents based on the relevance assessments of past queries. Through a learning process, our scheme establishes relevance links between documents found relevant for the same request. Based on this information {{and a list of}} retrieved records for the current request, the proposed mechanism tries to improve the ranking of the retrieved items in a sequence most likely to satisfy user intent. The underlying hypothesis of this mechanism states that future requests addressed to the system should have some degree of similarity with previous queries, or that the <b>retrieval</b> <b>apparatus</b> will process requests for which it has already found a partial, appropriate answer in the past. Participation: Category: B Query: ad-hoc, fully automatic Introduction To find pertinent information from a large text collection, most retrieval models represent both documents and requests by a set of weighted keywords. To extract relevant records from this collection, the retrieval function computes a similarity value or estimates a probability of relevance based on both document and query surrogates. When applying such a scheme, the system considers documents as separate entities. To relax this assumption, some studies have proposed various techniques and have reported evaluations describing the importance of interdocument relationships (e. g., [Kwok 88], [Turtle 91]). Our main research objective is also to analyze and assess interdocument relationshi [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The glycine {{receptor}} (GlyR) is {{the major}} inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor in spinal cord and brainstem. Heteropentameric GlyRs are clustered and anchored at inhibitory postsynaptic sites by the binding of the large intracellular loop between transmembrane domains 3 and 4 of the GlyRbeta subunit (GlyRbeta-loop) to the cytoplasmic scaffolding protein gephyrin. GlyRs are also cotransported with gephyrin along microtubules in the anterograde and retrograde direction due to the binding of gephyrin to microtubule-associated motor proteins. Additionally, GlyRs undergo lateral diffusion in the plasma membrane from extrasynaptic to synaptic sites and vice versa. Since its discovery, gephyrin has remained for many years the only binding partner interacting directly with the GlyRbeta subunit. In an attempt to elucidate further mechanisms involved in GlyR function and regulation at inhibitory postsynaptic sites, a proteomic screen for putative binding partners to the GlyRbeta loop was performed. Three proteins were identified as putative interactors. In this thesis, the interaction between these putative binding proteins and the GlyRbeta subunit was analyzed and characterized. Binding studies with glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins revealed that all putative binding proteins, Syndapin (Sdp), Vacuolar Protein Sorting 35 (Vps 35) and Neurobeachin (Nbea), interact specifically with the GlyRbeta loop. The Sdp family of proteins are F-BAR and SH 3 domain containing proteins. Inmmunocytochemical experiments showed that SdpI {{as well as the}} isoforms SdpII-S and SdpIIL colocalize with the full-length GlyRbeta subunit in a mammalian cell expression system. In cultured spinal cord neurons, a partial colocalization of endogenous SdpI with several excitatory and inhibitory synaptic markers was demonstrated. Mapping experiments using deletion mutants narrowed the SdpI binding site down to 22 amino acids. Peptide competition experiments confirmed the specificity of the interaction between SdpI and this sequence of the GlyRbeta subunit. Point mutation analysis revealed a SH 3 -proline rich domain dependent interaction between SdpI and the GlyRbeta subunit, respectively. In addition, binding studies in mammalian cells showed that both splice variants of SdpII as well as SdpI interact with the GlyR scaffolding protein gephyrin. Although the SdpI and gephyrin binding sites do not overlap, protein competition studies revealed that interaction of the E-domain of gephyrin with the GlyRbeta loop interferes with SdpI binding. Since SdpI is a dynamin binding protein involved in vesicle endocytosis and recycling pathways, a possible function of SdpI in the regulation of GlyR synaptic distribution was investigated. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed a SdpI-GlyR association in the vesicle-enriched fraction of rat spinal cord tissue. Immunocytochemical studies of SdpI knock out mice showed that the clustering and distribution of GlyRs in the brain stem is unchanged. However, acute down-regulation of SdpI in rat spinal cord neurons by viral shRNA expression led to a reduction in the number and size of GlyR clusters, an effect that could be rescued upon shRNA-resistant SdpI overexpression. Further immunocytochemical analysis of the localization of gephyrin, the gamma 2 subunit of the type A gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABAARgamma 2 subunit) and the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT) under SdpI knock-down conditions showed that both the number and average size of the gamma 2 -subunit containing GABAA receptor clusters were significantly reduced in spinal cord neurons. In contrast to GlyR and GABAARgamma 2 immunoreactivity, the number and average size of gephyrin and VIAAT clusters were barely reduced upon SdpI downregulation. These results suggest that SdpI has a role in GlyR trafficking that can be compensated by other syndapin isoforms or other trafficking pathways. Furthermore, SdpI might be required for the clusters of GlyRs and gamma 2 -subunit containing GABAARs in spinal cord and brainstem. Vps 35 is the core protein of the retromer complex, which mediates the endosome to Golgi <b>apparatus</b> <b>retrieval</b> of different types of receptors in mammals and yeast. Here, protein-protein interaction assays revealed {{for the first time that}} Vps 35 interacts directly with the GlyRbeta loop as well as with gephyrin. The generation of specific Vps 35 antibodies allowed to determine the distribution of this protein in the central nervous system. Immunocytochemical analyses revealed the presence of Vps 35 in the somata and neurites of spinal cord neurons, suggesting a possible interaction of Vps 35 with the GlyR under physiological conditions. Nbea is a BEACH domain containing, neuron-specific protein. Binding studies revealed a direct interaction between two regions of Nbea and the GlyRbeta loop. Immunocytochemical experiments confirmed a somatic and synaptic distribution of Nbea in primary cultures. In spinal cord neurons, a partial colocalization of Nbea with excitatory and inhibitory synaptic markers suggests a possible interaction of Nbea with the GlyR at inhibitory synaptic sites...|$|R
