Nearly 38% of <b>residual</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oils</b> are consumed in the shipping sector. In the process of converting excess residual oils into lighter oils by coking processes, pet coke is generated as a byproduct.

Pet coke is also used in Methanation plants to produce synthetic natural gas, etc. in order to avoid a pet coke disposal problem.|$|E
50|$|Many {{refineries}} {{are using}} the lower end residual oil with higher sulphur content to produce more lighter oils (petrol, diesel, etc) by installing petroleum coker units. This process generates a solid fuel called Pet coke which has higher calorific value and sulphur. As developed countries have banned use of high sulphur pet coke and residual oils, these fuels further are converted in to synthetic natural gas and methanol in Methanation plants to avoid their disposal problem. Nearly 38% of <b>residual</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oils</b> are consumed in the shipping sector.

50|$|Organic {{chemistry}} {{is concerned with}} the chemistry of carbon and the elements and compound with which it reacts. These compounds include mineral oil and all of its products and much of the output of industries manufacturing pharmaceuticals, paints, detergents, cosmetics, fuels etc. Typical examples of organic chemical changes include cracking heavy hydrocarbons at an oil refinery to create more gasoline from crude oil, as gasoline is in higher demand than the heavier hydrocarbons, such as <b>residual</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oils.</b> Other reactions include, methylation, condensation reactions, polymerisation, halogenation etc.|$|E
5000|$|Residual fuels are the [...] "dregs" [...] of the {{distillation}} process {{and are a}} thicker, heavier oil, or oil with higher viscosity, which are so thick {{that they are not}} readily pumpable unless heated. <b>Residual</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oils</b> are cheaper than clean, refined diesel oil, although they are dirtier. Their main considerations are for use in ships and very large generation sets, due to the cost of the large volume of fuel consumed, frequently amounting to many tonnes per hour. The poorly refined biofuels straight vegetable oil (SVO) and waste vegetable oil (WVO) can fall into this category, but can be viable fuels on non-common rail or TDI PD diesels with the simple conversion of fuel heating to 80 to 100 degrees Celsius to reduce viscosity, and adequate filtration to OEM standards. Engines using these heavy oils have to start and shut down on standard diesel fuel, as these fuels will not flow through fuel lines at low temperatures. Moving beyond that, use of low-grade fuels can lead to serious maintenance problems because of their high sulphur and lower lubrication properties. Most diesel engines that power ships like supertankers are built so that the engine can safely use low-grade fuels due to their separate cylinder and crankcase lubrication.|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of principal petroleum products at terminal and bulk plant levels is performed through integrated refiner-marketers and independent distributors. Refiner-maketers take 68 % {{of the supply}} of motor fuels, 39 % of distillates and 67 % of <b>residual</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oils.</b> The major oil companies are all engaged in marketing of petroleum products and exercise a substantial control over this division {{in order to maintain}} the price structure and afford adequate outlets. The main control over independent distributors has been through the denial of supplies, exclusive dealing, price discrimination, squeezing of margins and threat of elimination by means of oil tank trucks...|$|E

The decline {{is the result of}} price competition with natural gas and environmental restrictions on emissions. For power plants, the costs of heating the oil, extra pollution control and additional maintenance required after burning it often outweigh the low cost of the <b>fuel.</b> Burning <b>fuel</b> <b>oil,</b> particularly <b>residual</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil,</b> produces uniformly higher carbon dioxide emissions than natural gas.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} the multi-stage combustion of high-sulphur <b>residual</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oils</b> in thermal power stations which ensures minimum contamination of the atmosphere. In {{the first stage of}} combustion, high-pressure steam and fuel gas are produced. The latter is cooled and freed of ash and sulphur compounds. The steam and the purified gas are then used for power generation. The method gives a high rate of sulphur removal and considerable reduction of nitrogen oxide emission. This new power station concept employs gas turbines and steam/gas turbines to achieve the optimal use of energy. A discussion of technical and economic aspects concludes the paper. ...|$|E
40|$|Particle formation, deposition, and {{particle}} induced corrosion in large-scale medium-speed {{diesel engines}} The demands for higher efficiency in power-plant type diesel engines require {{an increase of}} the combustion temperatures. The aim is to extract the additional energy stored in hotter exhaust gases by installing a secondary steam turbine in the exhaust pipe, and efficiencies {{on the order of}} 50 % are achievable. However, reduction of lubrication and cooling in the cylinder and cylinder head are required, which means even higher temperature loads to materials. In addition, the engines are usually operated with low-grade <b>residual</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oils</b> with high ash content. In this work particle formation mechanisms, characteristics, morphology and composition in large-scale diesel engines are studied. These studies provided the necessary background information for laboratory-scale deposition and corrosion research, based of which a corrosion propagation model is presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Some {{aspects of}} the formation, control and {{dispersion}} of atmospheric pollution from fossil fuels are considered, especially the variation of concentration {{in time and space}} with weather and topography, the summation and interaction of many pollutants from various sources, and the large spatial scale involved. POLLUTANTS FORMED FROM FUEL FOSSIL fuels are responsible for most of the tonnage of air pollutants and much of the damage they cause. In weight, the main products are water and carbon dioxide; the latter has attracted interest because its "greenhouse " effect is important in the heat balance of the Earth. Man-made climatic changes of this type would be difficult to detect, however, because of natural fluctuations and the complicated feedback processes involved (SAWYER, 1972). Sulphur dioxide is an important pollutant. The sulphur content of fuels shows a wide range, from negligible amounts in gas up to several per cent in some coals and <b>residual</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oils.</b> The amounts of other pollutants depend greatly on the management of combustion, i. e. on the details and interactions of atomisation, flow pattern, mixing...|$|E

Inorganic sulfides and elemental sulfur were present in lower percentages. The Ni XANES spectra from all of the samples agree fairly well with that of NiSO 4, while most of the V spectra closely resemble that of vanadyl sulfate (VO{center_dot}SO{sub 4 }{center_dot}xH{sub 2 }O). The other metals investigated (Fe, Cu, Zn, and Pb) were also present predominantly as sulfates. Arsenic is present as an arsenate (As{sup + 5 }).

Natural gas market analysts generally emphasize weather and inventories as drivers of natural gas prices.
