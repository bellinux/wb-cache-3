5|$|Ancient India, {{particularly}} the centuries {{in which the}} Mahavira and the Buddha lived, were one of intense intellectual debates, especially {{on the nature of}} <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> self or soul.

As her battles grow more desperate and more people she cares for fall victim to the Elder Bairns, Saya begins finding faults in her <b>reality,</b> <b>and</b> eventually uncovers a disturbing truth about herself, the town and her surviving friends.|$|E
5|$|Dialogi and Summa Technologiae (1964) are Lem's {{two most}} famous {{philosophical}} texts. The Summa is notable {{for being a}} unique analysis of prospective social, cybernetic, and biological advances; in this work, Lem discusses philosophical implications of technologies that were completely {{in the realm of}} science fiction at the time, but are gaining importance today—for instance, virtual <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> nanotechnology.|$|E
5|$|In a final {{gesture of}} love and comprehension, after a {{lifetime}} of despising his father's stories and his father as story-teller, Will finishes the story his father has begun, pulling together the themes, images and characters of his father's storied life to blend <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> fantasy in act of communion and care. By unselfishly releasing the anger he has held about his father's stories, Will gains the understanding that all we are our stories and that his father's stories gave him a <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> substance and a dimension that was as real, genuine, and deep as the day-to-day experiences that Will sought out. Will comes to understand, then, that his father—and the rest of us—are our stories and that the deeper reality of our lives may, in fact, not be our truest self.|$|E

5|$|Millions {{of years}} ago, creatures known as Sarnathians ruled the Earth, {{centring}} their values on torture of other creatures that {{were opposed to}} their rule. Their aim was to rule the universe using a mysterious orb that granted them great power. Thousands of years later, the orb became too powerful and eventually caused a tear in the inter-dimensional fabric of the Realm of <b>Reality</b> <b>and</b> the Realm of Unreality, thus rendering the Sarnathians extinct.|$|E
5|$|N. R. Malkani finds Aurobindo's {{theory of}} {{creation}} to be false, as the theory talks about experiences and visions which are beyond normal human experiences.

Malkani says that awareness is already a <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> suggests {{there would be no}} need to examine the creative activity subjected to awareness.|$|E

5|$|The {{analogy of}} a game was first {{proposed}} by Hans-Georg Gadamer {{in an attempt to}} demonstrate the epistemic unity of language.

As pain medications are only somewhat effective, expectations regarding their benefit may differ from <b>reality,</b> <b>and</b> {{this can lead to}} decreased satisfaction.|$|E
