500|$|Although the decreed {{definition}} of the kilogramme specified water at 0°C — a highly stable temperature point — the scientists tasked with producing the new practical realisation chose to redefine the standard and perform their measurements at the most stable density point: the temperature at which water <b>reaches</b> <b>maximum</b> density, which was measured {{at the time as}} 4°C. They concluded that one cubic decimetre of water at its maximum density was equal to 99.92072% of the mass of the provisional kilogram made earlier that year. Four years later in 1799, an all-platinum standard, the [...] "Kilogramme des Archives", was fabricated with the objective that it would equal, as close as was scientifically feasible for the day, to the mass of cubic decimetre of water at 4°C. The kilogramme was defined to be equal to the mass of the Kilogramme des Archives and this standard stood for the next ninety years.|$|E

[...] In the diagram, the Fanno line <b>reaches</b> <b>maximum</b> entropy at H= 0.833 and the flow is choked. [...] According to the Second law of thermodynamics, entropy must always increase for Fanno flow. [...] This means that a subsonic flow entering a duct with friction will have an increase in its Mach number until the flow is choked. [...] Conversely, the Mach number of a supersonic flow will decrease until the flow is choked. [...] Each point on the Fanno line corresponds with a different Mach number, and the movement to choked flow is shown in the diagram.|$|E
40|$|Stomatal conductances of {{normally}} oriented and inverted {{leaves were}} measured as light levels (photosynthetic photon flux densities) were increased {{to determine whether}} abaxial stomata of Vicia faba leaves were more sensitive to light than adaxial stomata. Light levels were increased over uniform populations of leaves of plants grown in an environmental chamber. Adaxial stomata of inverted leaves <b>reached</b> <b>maximum</b> water vapor conductances at a light level of 60 micromoles per square meter per second, the same light level at which abaxial stomata of normally oriented leaves <b>reached</b> <b>maximum</b> conductances. Abaxial stomata of inverted leaves <b>reached</b> <b>maximum</b> conductances at a light level of 500 micromoles per square meter per second, the same light level at which adaxial stomata of normally oriented leaves <b>reached</b> <b>maximum</b> conductances. Maximum conductances in both normally oriented and inverted leaves were about 200 millimoles per square meter per second for adaxial stomata and 330 millimoles per square meter per second for abaxial stomata. Regardless of whether leaves were normally oriented or inverted, when light levels were increased to values high enough that upper leaf surfaces <b>reached</b> <b>maximum</b> conductances (about 500 micromoles per square meter per second), light levels incident on lower, shaded leaf surfaces were just sufficient (about 60 micromoles per square meter per second) for stomata of those surfaces to <b>reach</b> <b>maximum</b> conductances. This `coordinated' stomatal opening on the separate epidermes resulted in total leaf conductances for normally oriented and inverted leaves that were the same at any given light level. We conclude that stomata in abaxial epidermes of intact Vicia leaves are not more sensitive to light than those in adaxial epidermes, and that stomata in leaves of this plant {{do not respond to}} light alone. Additional factors in bulk leaf tissue probably produce coordinated stomatal opening on upper and lower leaf epidermes to optimally meet photosynthetic requirements of the whole leaf for CO 2...|$|R

2500|$|The above {{equation}} can {{be manipulated}} to solve for M {{as a function of}} H. However, due to the form of the T/T* equation, a complicated multi-root relation is formed for M = M(T/T*). Instead, M can be chosen as an independent variable where ΔS and H can be matched up in a chart as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 shows that heating will increase an upstream, subsonic Mach number until M = 1.0 and the flow chokes. [...] Conversely, adding heat to a duct with an upstream, supersonic Mach number will cause the Mach number to decrease until the flow chokes. [...] Cooling produces the opposite result for each of those two cases. The Rayleigh flow model <b>reaches</b> <b>maximum</b> entropy at M = 1.0 For subsonic flow, the maximum value of H occurs at M = 0.845. [...] This indicates that cooling, instead of heating, causes the Mach number to move from 0.845 to 1.0 [...] This is not necessarily correct as the stagnation temperature always increases to move the flow from a subsonic Mach number to M = 1, but from M = 0.845 to M = 1.0 the flow accelerates faster than heat is added to it. Therefore, this is a situation where heat is added but T/T* decreases in that region.|$|E
