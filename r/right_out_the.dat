They argued I was taking illegal liberty with the most incredible educational system in existence, and that I must be stopped immediately.

Schiff created a backstory for the character as a widower and wore his own wedding ring, something Sorkin and fellow executive producer Thomas Schlamme, who were planning for the character to be divorced, did not notice until the show's eighth episode. [...] "I had always imagined that his first wife had died, which accounts for his sadness, and why someone would devote himself to public service and be so singular about it", Schiff said.

5000|$|Van Morrison, {{speaking}} to biographer Ritchie Yorke about the writing {{and meaning of}} the song, said in part:"Madame George" [...] was recorded live. The vocal was live and the rhythm section and the flute too and the strings were the only overdub. The title of the song confuses one, I must say that. The original title was [...] "Madame Joy" [...] but the way I wrote it down was [...] "Madame George". Don't ask me why I do this because I just don't know. The song is just a stream of consciousness thing, as is [...] "Cyprus Avenue"..."Madame George" [...] just came <b>right</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> song is basically about a spiritual feeling.|$|E

5000|$|The FT-12 {{is one of}} Tippmann's newest paintball markers. Debuting in 2012, the FT-12 {{is aimed}} at rental and {{beginner}} use. The FT-12 uses a new body design never seen before in a Tippmann, using die-cast receivers. Splitting along the sides to open at the top, the FT-12 gives users a top-down view at the internals. The new body design can allow field owners to easily and quickly maintain their markers, with a savings of 75% in work time. The entire marker can be disassembled and reassembled in seconds, with everything coming <b>right</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> top. The FT-12 also utilizes an internal gasline, which prevents damage and leaks. The FT-12 also uses a [...] "closed bolt" [...] cocking system, similar to the A5, keeping dirt and debris from entering the marker through the cocking arm opening.|$|E

50|$|Murphy's World is {{actually}} the Realm of Faerie, the Land of Myths and Legends, the place of popular folklore and dreams (with a dash of pop culture) — comically twisted, yet maintaining an internal sense of 'logic'. It operates according to Murphy's Laws, which means that belief creates reality, {{and as a result}} reality is utterly fragmented. The real culprit is the planet's sun, Ludo. The strange distorting energies with which this amber orb assaults the little planet effectively toss any sense of predictability of natural laws or supernatural forces <b>right</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> metaphysical window. Murphy's World also happens to be in possession of an extensive but rather faulty network of interdimensional teleportation gates (through which many of the inhabitants have unwillingly arrived), connecting Murphy's World to just about everywhere. Thus, many residents of the planet are like Murphy — reluctant alien immigrants. New arrivals can pop up (in, down, or sideways) anywhere; confused, embarrassed, and wondering how to get home. Unfortunately, spaceships usually crash upon entering the atmosphere, and return gateways are often invisible, faulty, or out of order.|$|E
5000|$|The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) {{initiated}} a temporary ban on short selling on 799 financial stocks from September 19, 2008 until October 2, 2008 {{in an effort}} to slow the bear market. Lindzon was an opponent to the short lived SEC short selling ban in 2008 calling it [...] "a disservice to investors and market participants." [...] “I think the market was {{well on its way to}} a crash and I think it would have ended a lot faster if they hadn’t intervened this way,” Lindzon said. “For people who were really doing good work on Wall Street to get punished like this, it's a shame that their models went <b>right</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window.” [...] " [...] An assessment of the effect of the temporary ban on short-selling in the United States and other countries in the wake of the financial crisis showed that it had only [...] "little impact" [...] on the movements of stocks, with stock prices moving in the same way as they would have moved anyhow, but the ban reduced volume and liquidity.|$|E
5000|$|The Gremlin ties up Bugs’s ears {{leaving him}} {{confused}} and hits his foot with a monkey wrench, further taunting Bugs by [...] "laughing" [...] {{the first seven}} notes of [...] "Yankee Doodle" [...] once aboard the aircraft. Bugs recovers and gives chase, repeatedly getting slighted by the gremlin, which includes repeated strikes with a monkey wrench and the [...] "laughed" [...] musical taunt. Bugs chases the gremlin inside a bomber, and finds himself locked from the outside. Then the gremlin takes the plane to the air, unbeknownst to Bugs. Bugs manages to {{burst out of the}} plane’s exit door, narrowly escaping plunging to his death when he realizes the plane is airborne. He manages to get back in, only to slide <b>right</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> other door due to strategically placed banana skins; when the gremlin opens the door again, he finds Bugs (who has apparently and humorously aged several years through sheer terror) clinging to it with his heart beating [...] "4F" [...] (Army code for drastically limiting medical condition, hospitalization required). His cat-and-mouse game with the gremlin continues, until Bugs realizes that the Gremlin is flying the plane toward a pair of skyscrapers. Bugs rushes into the cockpit, takes control of the airplane, rolls it vertically and flies through an extremely narrow slot between the towers to avoid what seemed to be an inevitable impact.|$|E

Barrie was promoted to Major Series Lacrosse the next season.The Owen Sound Woodsmen hosted the 2007 Presidents Cup tournament.

In the league semi-final, the Woodsmen then beat the Merchants 2-games-to-none.
