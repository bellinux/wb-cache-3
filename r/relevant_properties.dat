50|$|Another type of reductionism is color physicalism. Physicalism is {{the view}} that colors are {{identical}} to certain physical properties of objects.

50|$|Often, {{functional}} {{as well as}} antigenic assays {{are applied}} to derive useful information from multiple exosomes. Well-known examples of assays to detect proteins in total populations of exosomes are mass spectrometry and Western blot. However, a limitation of these methods is that contaminants may be present that affect the information obtained from such assays. Preferably, information is derived from single exosomes. <b>Relevant</b> <b>properties</b> of exosomes to detect include size, density, morphology, composition, and zeta potential.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Consider {{a finite}} set of alternatives, and an {{associated}} collection of random variables representing some given <b>relevant</b> <b>property</b> of each alternative, {{such as its}} utility, cost or reliability. Suppose {{that there is a}} process that selects exactly one of these alternatives, an alternative with an extreme (maximal or minimal) value. In economics, discrete-choice analysis based on random utility theory is the most well-known modelling approach to such a process. Among practitioners, it is widely believed that in order to analyze such situations, one needs to resort to particular parametric forms of the underlying probability distributions of the random variables. We show that this is not so. Indeed, parametric forms impose unnecessary theoretical and empirical constraints and may hide more general properties. For the special case of statistical independence, we further provide a characterization of the invariance property that all random variables, representing the <b>relevant</b> <b>property</b> of the alternatives, have the same distribution, conditional upon being chosen...|$|R

5000|$|Requiring a {{property}} to be universal, however, {{is different from}} requiring it to be morally relevant.

50|$|With the {{epidemiology}} of representations, Sperber {{has argued}} that the notion of meaning is disregarded in memetics and that this is questionable since the study of society and culture without an explanation of how meaning is perceived and reproduced is contradictory.

5000|$|There are {{two methods}} for {{distinguishing}} between particles.

For a given type of dust grains, the emission from red giants and supergiants is essentially controlled by a single parameter — the overall dust optical depth. This leads to tight correlations among different spectral properties that explain many available observations and enable systematic studies of large data bases. 1...|$|R
