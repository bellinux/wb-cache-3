40|$|The {{utilization}} of crumb rubber in asphalt mixture has significantly {{evolved in the}} past few decades. However, the modification through dry process method has been a far less popular compared to the wet process due to a few drawbacks that affect its performance. One such concern that is often ignored by researcher relates to the <b>rubber–bitumen</b> interaction that causes swelling of the rubber particles within compacted asphalt mixture. <b>Rubber–bitumen</b> interaction refers to the absorption of bitumen particularly the maltenes fraction by rubber particles. This study investigated the effects of mixture design variables on the <b>rubber–bitumen</b> interaction and properties of rubberized asphalt mixtures fabricated through the dry method. The effects of <b>rubber–bitumen</b> interaction at different rubber sizes, bitumen contents, and curing periods were investigated using the “Basket Drainage Method”. While, the mechanical properties of rubberized asphalt mixtures were measured using resilient modulus and dynamic creep tests. Four types of gyratory compacted specimens of a dense grade mixture of asphaltic concrete were fabricated. The four specimen types comprised a control specimen without rubber and three other specimens with 2 % crumb rubber of varying sizes (1. 18, 3. 35 and 5. 0 mm). Results showed that higher <b>rubber–bitumen</b> interaction can be obtained with the use of fine rubber size and high bitumen content, thus exhibiting greater rubber swelling particularly in the first 4 h of curing. Specimen with fine rubber can be easily compacted to achieve the target density which shows consistency in the volumetric properties. The addition of crumb rubber reduces the resilient and creep modulus of asphalt mixtures compared to the control mix. However, by initiating the rubber swelling extensively prior to compaction can possibly improve the compatibility and volumetric properties, thus enhancing better performance of the rubberized asphalt mixtures...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{recycled}} scrap tires in asphalt mixtures {{is not a}} recent development with reclaimed tire crumb {{being used in the}} asphalt industry for over 40 years. Reclaimed tire crumb can be incorporated into asphalt mixtures using two different methods, referred to as the wet and dry processes. This study investigates the effect of <b>rubber-bitumen</b> interaction on the properties of rubberized asphalt mixture using dry process. The <b>rubber-bitumen</b> interaction is a significant issue in dry process even though this interaction is neglected in most of the previous studies. The =rubber swelling‘ activity occurs within the compacted asphalt mixture {{as a result of the}} bitumen absorption by the rubber particles that could result in inconsistent density of the compacted asphalt mixture, thus, affecting its performance. First, the effect of using different rubber gradation, bitumen content, and curing time on the interaction between rubber and bitumen or in other words the degree of bitumen absorption was investigated using =Basket Drainage Method‘. The investigation focused on the influence of these variables in achieving the target density as for rubberized asphalt mixture, it is important to achieve low target air void content after compaction for its stability. The relationships between the aforementioned variables and the target density of the mixture design were determined. An aggregate gradation of Asphalt Concrete with nominal maximum aggregate size 14 (AC 14) was used for preparing the gyratory compacted samples modified with 2 % crumb rubber with different rubber sizes. Finally these samples were tested for evaluating its performance in terms of dynamic creep and resilient modulus and compared with the conventional mixture. The results indicate a decrease in the resilient modulus and an increase in the dynamic creep for the rubberized asphalt mixtures. Fine rubber particles and the interaction time provided were observed to positively affect the mixture properties. Samples with fine rubber particles were found easily to compact compared to the one with coarse rubber...|$|E
40|$|The problem {{associated}} with {{solid waste management}} is on the increase both in the industries, urban cities and in the rural areas. In the United States of America, Asia and Europe, there are over hundreds of waste to wealth combustion plants from where solid wastes are incinerated.

40|$|This {{experimental}} study utilises the microwave technology {{to process the}} waste tyre rubber aggregates to enhance the interaction properties of waste rubber and bitumen by smoothing its surface. This {{was to make the}} waste rubber less reactive to the bitumen sample at the elevated temperatures of around 140 - 170 °C. Parameters such as the microwave power, the height of the sample inside the processing chamber and the processing time have been considered and optimised. The results show that the microwave processing technique designed in this study has significantly smoothened the surface of waste rubber. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) surface analysis has been carried out to confirm the changes and smoothness of the rubber surface in comparison to the untreated waste rubber aggregates. In addition, Microwave spectroscopy analysis has been carried out to confirm the reduction in the absorption properties of waste rubber. The microwave curves of the bitumen samples extracted from the treated <b>rubber-bitumen</b> blend are comparable to the pure bitumen sample with minute shifts in the resonant peaks. The results show the potential of the technique and recommends designing a dedicated processing unit to further improve it through parameters such as volumetric and uniform surface treatment, penetration depth of the microwaves...|$|E
40|$|Tire Rubber Modified Binders (TR-MBs), {{produced}} through {{wet process}} and used worldwide (e. g. asphalt rubber), {{have been demonstrated}} to provide various benefits to pavements and, moreover, represent a good opportunity for recycling tire rubber. However, this technology is still struggling to be fully adopted in Europe, {{mainly because of the}} poor stability of TR-MBs during high temperature storage, which leads to high initial costs in modifying existing asphalt plants. No-agitation TR-MBs (also known as terminal blends) are proving to be a great option and their development could also be the key to spreading the use of tire rubber in paving applications in Europe. This paper aims to enrich this field of research by presenting the results of a study focused on the compatibility of tire <b>rubber-bitumen</b> blends {{as well as on the}} effect of processing temperature variation on storage stability of TR-MBs. The experimental program was carried out by a preliminary selection of materials, followed by the production of the TR-MBs, via practical laboratory protocols. A continual comparison between two commercially used SBS-MBs, with high and medium levels of modification, and the TR-MBs produced, helped to understand the effect of varying the selected processing conditions on binder properties. The results showed that an accurate binder design is fundamental in order to obtain high performance binders and to improve compatibility of TR-MBs. Moreover, the study highlights that dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) is a suitable technique to assess the storage stability of modified binders...|$|E
40|$|Used tyres {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} types of waste and one of the polymer materials which are most difficult to recycle. There are many different applications for used tyres today. Part of the tyres can be retreated and re-used, but most of the used tyres are recycled. By dissolving the tyres, it is possible to filter out various chemical substances. These substances coming from the used tyres can be used for creating a new material or improving an existing one. One of the technologies involves adding chemically recycled tyres to the bitumen used in road pavement construction. The substances obtained from the recycled tyres can be used in the water proofing of bitumen. Methods of pyrolysis and solvolysis are used for recycling tyres into raw materials. In this research tyre recycling with thermal solvolysis is studied by using a conventional oven and microwave oven in order to obtain waterproofing materials with improved exploitation properties. Promising results are obtained in the pre-studies on the tyre recycling in the microwave allowing to reduce energy consumption before thermal processing of tyres as well as during the thermal processing process compared with methods involving heating in traditional furnace. Dissolving time of the recycled tyre pieces depending on the size of the pieces as well as energy consumption depending on furnace type, operating temperature and time have been assessed during the experimental part. Adhesive properties of the <b>rubber-bitumen</b> composite obtained during the experiments were tested. After testing the adhesive properties on the concrete surfaces it can be concluded that rubber-asphalt composite obtained in a microwave oven has the best adhesion because no waterproofing peeling has been found...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} {{continuous}} quality {{improvement of the}} road pavements, leads {{to the development of}} new binders, such as asphalt rubber (AR). AR is produced by the digestion of crumb rubber from used tires on bitumen. The resulting AR is a heterogeneous material with high viscosity. The study of this product during its production is essential due to the sudden and sharp increase in the volume of AR in this phase. Knowledge of the extent of this phenomenon has obvious implications {{in the design of the}} AR production equipment. In addition, to predict the performance of the AR in the pavement, its components (i. e. bitumen and rubber) should be analyzed separately. Thus, the objective of this paper is to present new experimental methods for the evaluation of the referred parameters, namely: i) a method to control the AR density during its production; ii) a modified “basket drainage method” to separate the swelled rubber from the residual bitumen after the AR production and; iii) a “sphere AR production simulator” (SARPS) method developed to reproduce the bitumen aging during the AR production (without the contribution of the rubber interaction). The effectiveness of these procedures was assessed by applying conventional CEN tests in the different bituminous materials obtained with the previous methods (base bitumen, sphere bitumen, residual bitumen and AR). SARPS method, combined with the “basket drainage method”, was found to be a simple and effective way to monitor <b>rubber-bitumen</b> interaction. SARPS was also a simple and adequate method to evaluate the aging of bitumen during AR production. Finally, it was also possible to assess the evolution of the bitumen, rubber and AR densities during the AR binder production...|$|E
40|$|Bearing in {{mind the}} need to answer {{one of the most}} {{frequent}} needs for civil construction, in general, and major project such as road infrastructures in particular, this paper presents the results of a laboratory experimental study in order to evaluate the performance improvement that is possible to achieve when modifying road bitumen with CRM (Crumb Rubber Modifier) from discarded tire rubber (TR), using a Wet Process. The environmental advantage is double, since the aim of the research is to obtain high performance road bitumen thanks to the re-use of a discarded material, such as the rubber tires, which otherwise would be dumped in scrap-yard. In particular, this experimental study aimed to define a laboratory optimization protocol that allowed to discriminate amongst the different asphalt–rubber blends, in relation to the different content of rubber, {{as well as to the}} blending times, with the possibility of carefully controlling the production temperature throughout the production process. In order to do this, simple and widespread laboratory equipments and procedures have been adopted, such as the Brookfield rotational viscometer, capable of ensuring the representativeness of the final product to be tested. After the optimization study, a comparison was made between the conventional and rheological properties of the optimized rubber–asphalt blend with those of two commercially available PMBs, modified with synthetic rubber type Styrene–Butadiene–Styrene, with two different level of modification: a medium and a high level of polymer, respectively termed as ‘‘Medium’’ and ‘‘High’’ in this study. This comparison allows one to appreciate to what extent control of the modification process is able to affect the properties of the final product and shows that the preliminary optimization of the mixing parameters carried out with the proposed protocol allows one to obtain a <b>rubber–bitumen</b> blend with improved performances, above all reduced temperature susceptibility, as proved by an increase in the Superpave™ high temperature performance grading, up to a two grade jump, which it is possible to obtain only for SBS modified bitumen with high content of polymer. Therefore, this study proves that, thanks to the appropriate re-use of crumb rubber form scrap tires, with the proposed optimization protocol it is possible obtain improved bitumen with high content of recycled materials that, with respect to specific needs of regions with warm climates such as the Mediterranean area, can be considered as ‘‘high-performance blends’’...|$|E
40|$|With the {{exponential}} {{growth in the}} number of automobiles in Malaysia in recent years, the problem generated by waste tyres has also increased. Therefore, incorporating waste tyres as an additive in road pavement might be an option to overcome the increase in the number of waste tyres as well as address some of the pavement problems, such as rutting deformation. Crumb rubber modified binder is acknowledged to provide better rutting resistance. Many research works have been implemented on the effects of chemical additives to further increase the performance of crumb rubber modified binders. Recent studies have shown that the properties of crumb rubber modified binders can be improved by adding crosslinking agents, such as trans-polyoctenamer (TOR) for which the main function is to activate the <b>rubber-bitumen</b> interaction and improve crosslinking. This study was conducted to determine a method to improve the rutting resistance of SMA 20 bituminous mixtures. Accordingly, different percentages of crumb rubber were added to bitumen using different blending methods (continuous blend and terminal blend) in order to produce different concentrations of crumb rubber modified binder. In addition, a crosslinking agent, namely, trans-polyoctenamer (TOR), was introduced in the crumb rubber modified binder with the intention of further improving the binder properties and minimizing the rutting problem. In order to analyse the performance of the binders and mixtures as well as to evaluate the relationship of the rutting characteristics between them, a series of binder tests and bituminous mixture tests were performed. In the final analysis, the author found that the binder tests were not adequate to evaluate the rutting characteristics of bituminous mixtures. For instance, in the case of the crumb rubber modified binder prepared using the terminal blend method, most of the binder tests show that the terminal blend binder displays the best performance; however, in respect of the bituminous mixtures it became worse. To further study the creep behaviour (rutting characteristics) of bituminous mixtures, the dynamic creep test was performed using the universal testing machine (UTM) at different temperatures and stress levels. Finally, the creep behaviour of the specimens was estimated using the Zhou three-stage creep model. The results show that crumb rubber and TOR significantly affected the rutting parameters, especially at high stress levels and temperatures. Moreover, based on the Zhou model, it was concluded that resistance to permanent deformation (rutting resistance) was improved by the application of crumb rubber and TOR. In addition, multiple linear regression (stepwise method) was used for statistical analysis for which the main objective was to develop an equation (regression model) that could be used for predicting the rutting of the mixtures for all factors engaged. A secondary purpose was to use regression analysis as a means of explaining the causal relationship among the factors (significant level) ...|$|E
