40|$|The {{increased}} demand for aluminum as a primary structural metal stems from a quest in automotive, aerospace, and marine industries to be more energy efficient and sustainable. This unprecedented demand drives aluminum casting methods towards increased productivity looking to, cast larger ingots faster. The unfortunate consequence {{of this approach is}} an enhanced variation of metallurgical properties over the cross section of slab ingots. <b>Rolling</b> <b>slab</b> ingots of AlCu 4. 5 using a typical Direct-Chill casting technique have been cast and sectioned for analysis. This alloy allowed us to compare our results with the available literature and to elucidate the marked differences in spatial variation of microstructure and composition found in radial and lateral symmetry castings. In an attempt to couple conventional theory with our results, sump and temperature profiles were measured in-situ and modeled using a commercial finite element analysis software package. The combination of experimental and modeling results indicate that the variations in the cooling parameters through the cross section are largely responsible for the spatial variances in metallurgical properties, pointing to a possible refinement of DC casting parameters. by Samuel R.

40|$|A {{study of}} strain path related effects on {{recrystallisation}} in aluminium {{has been carried}} out. The recrystallisation process has been studied after deformation in torsion and one pass hot rolling. For both deformation models, the work has been a combination of experimental studies of the deformation microstructure and recrystallisation process, as well as use of models for prediction of the deformation- and recrystallisation process. For deformation in torsion AA 1050 and AA 3103 has been studied. Cyclic deformation to zero net strain resulted in restoration of the initial grain structure, while monotonic deformation yielded an increasingly more elongated grain structure. Studies by EBSD revealed no difference in subgrain size as function of strain path, but the subgrain misorientation was larger after monotonic deformation. Similarly, the distance between high angle boundaries was smaller after monotonic deformation. The recrystallised grain size was larger after cyclic deformation, compared to monotonic deformation to the same cumulative strain. In AA 1050 the difference in recrystallised grain size was mainly sees as an effect of difference in grain boundary area, leading to fewer nuclei after cyclic deformation. A small difference in driving pressure {{also contributed to the}} difference in recrystallised grain size. In AA 3110 an additional effect of weakening of deformation zones surrounding particles was purposed, resulting in lower density of PSN-nuclei after cyclic deformation and accordingly larger grain size. The experimental study of the hot rolling pass was performed on an AA 3103 alloy. A slight increase in Vickers hardness was seen from center to surface of the <b>rolling</b> <b>slab</b> after deformation. The microstructure after rolling was predicted by a combination of FEM-simulations and a microstructure model. This approach resulted in a larger predicted gradient in flow stress through thickness than calculated from the hardness measurements. The recrystallisation kinetics were monitored and were found to be fastest in the surface areas. The experimentally measured gradient in recrystallisation kinetics from center to surface was much larger than what was modeled. This was seen as an effect of the models limited coverage of changes in the density of nuclei as a result of other mechanisms than a difference in the driving pressure. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

The {{paper is}} dealing with {{application}} of theoretical equations derived for rock disintegration onto materials with similar behavior—thick scales on hot metal rolling slabs. Penetration of water jet through a hot, rock-like material (e. g. scale) and work of the steam bubbles emerging from the water jet on {{the boundary between the}} scale layer and the hot metal material are described by a set of appropriate equations. The model is applied on the fan jets used for de-scaling process, and it provides both the qualitative and the quantitative results. These results make possible to determine the depth of penetration of water jet into the material of the scales and calculate the sizes of pieces of the disintegrated scales. Both mechanisms of water jet acting on scales, mechanical penetration to a certain depth in the material and the formation of steam bubbles inside the material, create mechanical stresses in the material of scales, especially the tensile and the shear ones. Pieces of scales are separated due to exceeding the limits of the stress and strain in the material of scales. The presented analytical equations describing the process in a simple way yield the quick and apprehensible calculation of applicable results. It is an alternative to solution of a rather complicated set of differential equations describing the mass and heat flow. The proposed theoretical base runs with technical factors and properties that can be obtained from tables or analogies with other materials or processes. The typical water pressure range of rolling mills is 16 – 24 MPa, the equivalent diameter of the applied water nozzle is 2 mm, the average traverse speed of the <b>rolling</b> <b>slab</b> is set to 1 m s− 1, and the mean stand-off distance of the nozzle from the steel slab surface is 150 mm.

Simultaneously, the calculated length of the peeled layer {{in the direction of the}} jet movement ranges from 30 to 70 mm and the cutting width determined from the jet shape and the stand-off distance is 80 – 120 mm.

40|$|Abstract: Most of the {{commercial}} metallic materials undergo at least one hot deformation stage during fabrication. Hot deformation processing leads {{to the production of}} plates, strips, rods, pipes and other shapes at lower overall cost when compared to the cold deformation/annealing route. Comprehensive study of the metallurgical phenomena during hot deformation has enormous potential application in the control of industrial rolling processes. Understanding of the microstructural and mean flow stress evolution lead to sound steel developments and innovative rolling schedules. The models predict parameters such as grain size, fractional softening (static and dynamic) and strain induced precipitation which are useful to improve rolling schedules. Effects such as incomplete softening and strain accumulation can be easily detected as well as their consequences on the final grain size and mechanical properties. In this regard, special attention must be given to steels, the most important metallic material in terms of history, present and future. In this paper, three hot rolling routes will be analyzed in order to produce high strength linepipe steels.

In the present paper, the experimental methods used for investigating interfacial heat transfer and friction conditions are described. These include hot flat <b>rolling</b> of steel <b>slabs</b> and hot axisymmetric forging of steel cylinders and rings. Temperature measurements and computations demonstrate that for similar conditions, the effective interfacial heat transfer coefficients (IHTC) derived for hot rolling are significantly higher than those for forging, mainly due to the contribution of scale cracking during rolling. On the basis of experimental observations and numerical analysis, physical models for interfacial heat transfer in forging and rolling have been established. In addition, hot 'sandwich' rolling and hot tensile tests with finite element modelling have been carried out to evaluate teh hot ductility of the oxide scale. The results indicate that the deformation, cracking and decohesion behaviour of the oxide scale depend on deformation temperature, strain and relative strengths of the scale layer and scale - steel interface.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{focussed}} on improving the material yield in closed-die forging and rolling. The former {{is restricted to}} the manufacturing of heavy crown wheels and front axle beams and the latter to the hot <b>rolling</b> of steel <b>slabs.</b> To enhance the yield the commercial FE-codes Form 2 D and Dyna 3 D are used. Results from forging simulations are strengthened by full scale experiments. The research is carried out in near contact with the Swedish steel and engineering industry. In closed die forging, two bulk forming problems are treated: How to improve the tool design and how to change the pre-form geometry for decreasing the amount of material exiting the flash gap? In <b>slab</b> <b>rolling,</b> two problems related to material defects are considered: How to eliminate existing surface cracks and how to prevent the formation of voids around macro-inclusions embedded in the steel matrix? Internal voids might be the reason for scrapping the whole workpiece. Considering the forging of crown wheels, a new concept is proposed. For making the central hole of the product, the traditional method was forging a thin circular plate which was then sheared off and scrapped. Using the new technique this operation is replaced by forging a conical tap in the centre, which is then discarded. Doing so, the inner scrap material decreased with about 15 %. The idea {{has been used in}} production for seven years. – Regarding the forging of front axle beams, a quasi- 3 D method is used comprising full scale measurements of the axial material flow. Here the theoretical material yield increased 2 - 7 %. Regarding rolling, the initial surface cracks in the simulations are V-shaped with a crack angle of 6 o and of depth 5 - 20 mm. The inclusions are cylindrical and either three times harder or three times softer than the matrix. The behaviour of the cracks and the inclusions are studied as influenced by process parameters. Current industrial input data are used as a reference. – It is concluded that longitudinal cracks cannot be totally eliminated. During rolling their V-shape gradually changes to Y-shape and a remaining oxide flake separates the crack bottom surfaces. For minimizing the detrimental influence of the entrapped oxide, an early closure of the crack bottom is important. Throughout the remaining rolling schedule the entrapped oxide is then torn to pieces with large areas of virgin metal in between ensuring a strong bond. The following recommendations are given for the longitudinal cracks: Light drafts/pass {{at the beginning of the}} rolling schedule followed by heavy ones. – Contradictory to longitudinal cracks it is concluded that transversal cracks are possible to eliminate. When eliminated, the initial bottom of the crack coincides with the slab surface. No folds are formed. For the transversal cracks light drafts/pass are proposed together with reversal rolling, the latter for avoiding crack folding. – Voids are easiest formed around hard macro-inclusions in the centre of the slab. Large rolls and heavy drafts are recommended to avoid this. QC 2010072...|$|R

The study was based around three main components, namely a mathematical model of the process, its associated adaptation and an expert system. A novel architecture was developed to integrate the three components into a setup control system, along with some additional functions. The objective of the mill setup system {{is to determine the}} optimum mill actuator set points and control targets prior to the <b>rolling</b> of the <b>slab.</b> It is the function of the mill setup and supervisory control system to ensure that the material produced is of primary quality and that a high productivity level is achieved.;The novel control architecture incorporates three main components. Firstly, process models are used to predict the states of the rolling process prior to rolling. These models predict the rolling load, motor power and strip temperature, thermal camber of the work rolls, deflection of the mill stack and the profile and shape of the strip. Adaptation ensures that there is a good agreement between measurements and the model predictions. The adaptation is split into two main levels. A Kalman filter is used to predict short term errors in the process model from one pass to the next. Long term variations in the process are tracked using the recursive least squares algorithm. Finally the expert system is used to schedule the mill, diagnose possible faults occurring within the process and to supervise the activities of the other components in the control system.;The system is demonstrated in simulation and comparisons are made with and without the expert system control. The results show that there are distinct improvements to be gained with the application of artificial intelligence to an industrial control problem, in this case a hot aluminium rolling mill...|$|R
40|$|Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is {{a problem}} of finding a minimum {{travelling}}-cost route of n cities (Fig. 1). Asymmetric TSP (ATSP) is a variant of TSP, where the travelling cost from city i to j is different from the one from j to i. TSP with time window (TSP-TW) is another variant of TSP in which a travelling time between two cities and a staying time for visiting each city are additionally defined and an allowed time-window for visiting each city is given as a constraint. These are combinatorial optimization problems, which are considered impossible to find optimal solutions in polynomial time. This study deals with asymmetric TSP with time window (ATSP-TW). The formulation of ATSP-TW is shown in Fig. 2. An example of ATSP-TW is a slab sequencing problem in steel manufacturing. When rolling out a lot of slabs with various thicknesses and widths is conducted, the difference in thicknesses and widths of neighboring slabs causes the deterioration of product quality, which is reflected as the increase of production cost. Generally this cost is proportional to the differences of thicknesses or widths, but it is asymmetric; for example, the cost when <b>rolling</b> a wide <b>slab</b> after a narrow one is smaller than the cost in reverse order. Slab sequencing problem {{is a problem}} to determine the rolling order with minimal cost in consideration of the processing time and deadline of each slab. Here, we aim to obtain a sub-optimal solution at the reasonable calculation time within five minutes for a large-scale ATSP-TW with up to approximately 300 cities. We are trying a method that relaxes the problem by adding the time-window constraint to the evaluation function and applies simulated annealing (SA), a kind of metaheuristics, for solving the problem...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{preformed}} on a Gleeble 3500 Thermomechanical Simulator {{to study}} the hot ductility behaviour of C-Mn-A 1 steel {{and the influence of}} Nb, Ti and Nb-Ti additions. The simple hot tensile test has been shown to correlate well to the problem of transverse cracking. Therefore, the principle aim of this research is to gain a greater understanding of transverse cracking during the straightening of continuously cast slabs. In particular, attention was paid to thin slab casting conditions. Hot tensile test specimens were either solution treated in melted in-situ (direct cast) and cooled to the deformation temperature. Solution treatment tests simulated conventional casting, where slabs are cooled to room temperature than heated prior to rolling. Direct cast tests simulated hot direct <b>rolling</b> conditions, where <b>slabs</b> are rolled directly after casting without being cooled below the austenite to ferrite transformation. Specimens were cooled to the deformation temperature at two cooling rates, 100 K/min and 200 K/min. The cooling rate of 100 K/min corresponds to the average cooling rate experienced for a conventionally cast slab, 250 mm in thickness. The cooling rate of 200 K/min corresponds to the average cooling rate for thin-cast slabs, 50 mm in thickness. The development of the combination of thin slab casting of hot direct rolling requires hot ductility work to be performed under direct cast conditions and at higher cooling rates. Surface quality is of the utmost importance in thin slab casting so the elimination of transverse cracking is of prime economic importance. There are significant differences between as-cast (direct cast) and reheated (solution treatment) microstructures. In particular, changes in precipitate behaviour, austenite grain size, and the relationship between segregation and the position of austenite gran boundaries was investigated. An attempt has been made to determine what influences these differences in microstructure have on hot ductility. Niobium bearing steels were selected for the reason that there are still problems with Nb steels regarding transverse cracking. Furthermore, there have been contradictory reports on the effects of Ti additions on the transverse cracking behaviour of NB steels. There is evidence from commercial practice that indicates that small additions of Ti improve the transverse cracking susceptibility of Nb steels. However, laboratory results generally show Ti additions have little influence or even a detrimental effect on hot ductility. Disparities in the thermal history simulated in laboratory tests to actual conditions near the surface of a continuously cast slab is the most likely reason for this discrepancy. Therefore, the influence of more closely simulating the thermal history conditions near the surface of a continuously cast slab was evaluated for the Nb-Ti steel. Experimental work involved metallographic and scanning electron microscopy examination of the fracture surface. Transmission electron microscopy was used to determine precipitation characteristics. Tensile tests were conducted to determine mechanical properties, where reduction in area (RA) was used as a measure of ductility. The dendritic structure for direct cast and solution treatment specimens was revealed using a heat treatment procedure (normalising). Particle size was correlated to reduction of area for precipitates in the single-phase austenite temperature region. It was shown that particles below 15 nm were detrimental to hot ductility. The relationship between interparticle spacing and reduction of area was also determined. Microalloying additions to C-Mn-A 1 steels significantly widen the ductility trough but the depth remains similar. Low ductility was found at higher temperatures in the microalloyed steels due the intergrandular failure as a result of grain boundary sliding in the austenite. Grain boundary sliding was favoured by the slow strain rate and was enhanced by fine microalloyed nitrates and/or carbides. Fine particles can pin austenite grain boundaries, allowing sufficient time for cracks to link together, ultimately causing intergranular fracture. Increasing the cooling rate generally lowered ductility further by promoting finer precipitation. The trough depth is similar in all steels as the formation of thin ferrite films controls ductility at the minimum trough position. The formation of thin films of ferrite allowed strain to concentrate in the softer ferrite phase and intergrandular failure occurred due to microvoid coalescence. Direct cast conditions always led to lower ductility compared to solution treatment conditions. This is explained in terms of differences in the microstructure, namely, grain size, segregation and precipitation. It is recommended that direct cast conditions should be used to determine hot ductility behaviour as it more accurately simulates continuous casting conditions. It was found that simulating the thermal history near the surface of a continuously coast slab, as opposed to cooling directly to the deformation temperature, improved ductility of the Nb-Ti steel. This improvement in ductility was attributed to the thermal history providing favourable conditions for coarsening of NbTi (C,N) ...|$|R
