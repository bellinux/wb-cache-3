25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, rival CBS gained ground by {{allowing}} radio stars {{to use their}} own production companies to produce programs, which became a profitable move for much of its talent. In the early years of radio, stars and programs commonly hopped between networks when their short-term contracts expired. During 1948 and 1949, beginning with the nation's top <b>radio</b> <b>star,</b> Jack Benny, many NBC performers – including Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy, Burns and Allen and Frank Sinatra – jumped to CBS.|$|E
40|$|In {{the linkage}} between the optical and the radio {{reference}} frames the <b>radio</b> <b>stars</b> are the important objects.

Keywords: Astrometry, Reference frames, <b>radio</b> <b>stars.</b> 1. INTRODUCTION Using the <b>radio</b> <b>stars</b> is one method of {{the linkage between}} the optical and radio reference frames. From 1980 to 1982 and from 1985 to 1988 respectively with the astrolabe, photoelectric astrolabe and astrograph at Shanghai Observatory, about 100 <b>radio</b> <b>stars</b> have been observed.

25|$|Allen first hosted The Linit Bath Club Revue on CBS, {{moving the}} show to NBC and {{becoming}} The Salad Bowl Revue (in a nod to new sponsor Hellmann's Mayonnaise, which was marketed by {{the parent company of}} Linit) later in the year. The show became The Sal Hepatica Revue (1933–34), The Hour of Smiles (1934–35), and finally Town Hall Tonight (1935–39). In 1939–40, however, sponsor Bristol-Myers, which advertised Ipana toothpaste as well as Sal Hepatica during the program, altered the title to The Fred Allen Show, over his objections. Allen's perfectionism (odd to some, considering his deft ad-libs) caused him to leap from sponsor to sponsor until Town Hall Tonight allowed him to set his chosen small-town milieu and establish himself as a bona fide <b>radio</b> <b>star.</b>|$|E
500|$|Sheldon Leonard, {{producer}} of The Danny Thomas Show, and Danny Thomas hired veteran comedy writer Arthur Stander (who had written {{many of the}} [...] "Danny Thomas" [...] episodes) to create a pilot show for Andy Griffith, featuring him as {{justice of the peace}} and newspaper editor in a small town. [...] At the time, Broadway, film, and <b>radio</b> <b>star</b> Griffith was interested in attempting a television role, and the William Morris Agency told Leonard that Griffith's rural background and previous rustic characterizations were suited to the part. After conferences between Leonard and Griffith in New York, Griffith flew to Los Angeles and filmed the episode. [...] On February 15, 1960, The Danny Thomas Show episode [...] "Danny Meets Andy Griffith" [...] aired. [...] In the episode Griffith played fictional Sheriff Andy Taylor of Mayberry, North Carolina, who arrests Danny Williams (Thomas's character) for running a stop sign. [...] Future players in The Andy Griffith Show, Frances Bavier and Ron Howard, appeared in the episode as townspeople Henrietta Perkins and Opie Taylor (the sheriff's son). General Foods, sponsor of The Danny Thomas Show, had first access to the spin-off and committed to it immediately. On October 3, 1960, at 9:30pm, The Andy Griffith Show made its debut.|$|E

5000|$|John's Children {{reformed}} in {{the mid-1990s}} with Boz Boorer on guitar and former <b>Radio</b> <b>Stars</b> member Martin Gordon on bass, performing gigs [...] in the UK, Italy, Spain and the USA. In 1999, Ellison, Townson and Gordon were joined by guitarists Trevor White (a former member of Sparks) and Ian Macleod (<b>Radio</b> <b>Stars)</b> to perform a selection of John's Children, Jet and <b>Radio</b> <b>Stars</b> repertoire, released as [...] "Music for the Herd of Herring" [...] and recorded in the UK, the Netherlands and Germany.|$|R

Between the demise of Jet and its reincarnation as <b>Radio</b> <b>Stars</b> in 1976, he performed briefly with pioneer of American punk Ian North; along with drummer Paul Simon, Gordon played a handful of dates with Ian's Radio before rejoining members of Jet to form <b>Radio</b> <b>Stars.</b>|$|R
5000|$|An {{official}} spokesperson {{indicates that}} [...] "Radio Stars {{should not be}} confused with <b>radio</b> <b>stars,</b> namely stars that produce by means of chemical and electrical discharges, emissions of various radio frequencies, whether constant or pulsed. <b>Radio</b> <b>Stars,</b> no matter whether constant or pulsed, will under no circumstances produce discharges or emissions. Well, under no circumstances to which we can refer in polite company, at any rate".|$|R
2500|$|Allen has {{two stars}} on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: a <b>radio</b> <b>star</b> at 6713 Hollywood Blvd. and a TV star at 7001 Hollywood Blvd. His widow, Portland Hoffa, married bandleader Joe Rimes in 1959 and celebrated a second silver wedding anniversary well before her own death of natural causes in Los Angeles on Christmas Day, 1990. Allen was {{inducted}} into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1988. A pedestrian passageway in the Boston Theater District, designated [...] "Allen's Alley", also honors his memory.|$|E
2500|$|The Jack Benny Program {{evolved from}} a variety show {{blending}} sketch comedy and musical interludes into the situation comedy form we now recognize, crafting particular situations and scenarios from the fictionalization of Benny the <b>radio</b> <b>star.</b> Common situations included hosting parties, income tax time, nights on the town, [...] "backstage" [...] interactions between Jack and his cast at the radio studio during show rehearsals, contract negotiations, or traveling by train or plane to and from Jack's many personal appearances throughout the country (hence the [...] "Train leaving on track five" [...] gag).

2500|$|T-ara {{made their}} debut on MBC's <b>Radio</b> <b>Star</b> talk show on July 29, 2009.

[...] (놀아볼래?, [...] "Wanna Play?") from their debut single. Their debut was looked upon negatively by webpostings, where people {{stated that it}} was lipsynched and commented that it seemed like an [...] "elementary school" [...] performance. The group announced afterwards that future performances would be live. In September 2009, Eunjung, Soyeon, Hyomin and Jiyeon collaborated with labelmates Kwangsu, Jihyuk, and Geonil of Supernova for the single [...] "TTL (Time to Love)". It was released on September 15, 2009, and became both groups' first number one song as it topped many of the online charts. T-ara and Supernova collaborated again for [...] "TTL Listen 2", a sequel to [...] "TTL (Time to Love)", which was released on October 9, 2009, and included all the members from both groups.|$|E
