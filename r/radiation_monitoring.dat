5|$|Chronic underinvestment in {{research}} since 1990 forced many scientific professionals {{to leave the}} country. As a result, Bulgaria scores low in terms of innovation, competitiveness and high-value added exports. Principal areas {{of research and development}} are energy, nanotechnology, archaeology and medicine. The Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (BAS) is the leading scientific establishment and employs most Bulgarian researchers in its numerous institutes. It has been active in the field of space science with RADOM-7 <b>radiation</b> <b>monitoring</b> experiments on the International Space Station and Chandrayaan-1, and domestically developed space greenhouses on the Mir space station. Bulgaria became the sixth country in the world to have an astronaut in space with Georgi Ivanov's flight on Soyuz 33 in 1979. Bulgaria is an active member of CERN and has contributed to its activities with nearly 200 scientists since its accession in 1999.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} a compact <b>radiation</b> <b>monitor</b> {{prototype}} has been developed. The present device and its technology will directly contribute towards the CPT-SCOPE project, a Norwegian-German student project developing a <b>radiation</b> <b>monitor</b> for space application. The present design utilises an {{application specific integrated circuit}} (ASIC) {{which provides a}} low-power and small-form factor solution. Such system is required for small satellites and CubeSats. The development of the device has been carried out in multiple design steps. A functioning <b>radiation</b> <b>monitor</b> prototype has been developed, implemented and tested. First measurements of cosmic ray background, beta particle and low-energetic gamma ray sources verify its functionality. This marks a major milestone towards a compact <b>radiation</b> <b>monitor</b> for nanosatellites. While this work deals with a technology demonstrator, it directly contributes to the CPT-SCOPE project. The finished CPT-SCOPE instrument and its flight aboard BEXUS 20 in October 2015 will be the next milestone. In the future this should lead towards CPT-SCOPE 2. 0, a CubeSat-ready compact <b>radiation</b> <b>monitor.</b> The project demonstrated the usability of COTS components in hybrid with specialised, radiation-hard integrated circuits for radiation detection.
