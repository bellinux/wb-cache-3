25|$|Springtails are {{currently}} used in laboratory tests {{for the early}} detection of soil pollution. Acute and chronic toxicity tests have been performed by researchers, mostly using the parthenogenetic isotomid Folsomia candida. These tests have been standardized. Details on a <b>ringtest,</b> on the biology and ecotoxicology of Folsomia candida and comparison with the sexual nearby species Folsomia fimetaria (sometimes preferred to Folsomia candida) are given in a document written by Paul Henning Krogh. Care should be taken that different strains {{of the same species}} mays be conducive to different results. Avoidance tests have been also performed. They have been standardized, too. Avoidance tests are complementary to toxicity tests, but they also offer several advantages: they are more rapid (thus cheaper), more sensitive and they are environmentally more reliable, because in the real world Collembola move actively far from pollution spots. It may be hypothesized that the soil could become locally depauperated in animals (and thus improper to normal use) while below thresholds of toxicity. Contrary to earthworms, and like many insects and molluscs, Collembola are very sensitive to herbicides and thus are threatened in no-tillage agriculture, which makes a more intense use of herbicides than conventional agriculture.|$|E

50|$|A <b>ringtest</b> {{is part of}} an {{external}} quality assurance programme for a measuring method. Usually a reference institute sends identical samples which have to be analysed for special parameters to different laboratories. The industrial, medical or research laboratory gets a limited time with a deadline to send in the analysis results. The statistical evaluation and interpretation of the laboratories’ results is a great help for all participating labs as it opens the possibility to assess the quality of their analysis compared to other laboratories. For accredited laboratories (e.g. ISO 17025 etc.) the participation in ringtests is obligatory. Nevertheless, also non accredited labs take part in ringtests.|$|E

40|$|Arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} (AM) fungi colonize {{roots and}} form {{two kinds of}} mycelium, intraradical mycelium (IRM) and extraradical mycelium (ERM). Arbuscules are characteristic IRM structures that highly branch within host cells in order to mediate resource exchange between the symbionts. They are ephemeral structures {{and at the end}} of their life span, arbuscular branches collapse from the tip, fungal cytoplasm withdraws, and the whole arbuscule shrinks into fungal clumps. The exoskeleton of an arbuscule contains structured chitin, which is a polymer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), whereas a collapsed arbuscule does not. The molecular mechanisms underlying the turnover of chitin in AM fungi remain unknown. Here, a GlcNAc transporter, <b>RiNGT,</b> was identified from the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis. Yeast mutants defective in endogenous GlcNAc uptake and expressing <b>RiNGT</b> took up 14 C-GlcNAc, and the optimum uptake was at acidic pH values (pH 4. 0 – 4. 5). The transcript levels of <b>RiNGT</b> in IRM in mycorrhizal Lotus japonicus roots were over 1000 times higher than those in ERM. GlcNAc- 6 -phosphate deacetylase (DAC 1) and glucosamine- 6 -phosphate isomerase (NAG 1) genes, which are related to the GlcNAc catabolism pathway, were also induced in IRM. Altogether, data suggest the existence of an enhanced recycling mode of GlcNAc in IRM of AM fungi...|$|R

With microarray technology the expression of thousands of genes can be measured in parallel. The gene expression profiles of Folsomia candida exposed to environmental toxicants allow fast and sensitive detection of pollution, and additionally clarifies molecular mechanisms causing toxicology.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was the {{organisation}} and performance of an international <b>Ringtest</b> for the Enchytraeid Reproduction Test (ERT) which was developed on behalf of the German Federal Environmental Agency (UBA) several years ago. An existing Draft Guideline presented during a workshop in Bad Soden (Germany) in 1995 was used to run the test. A total of 29 institutions (governmental agencies, universities, contract laboratories, and industry) from 15 different countries participated in the <b>Ringtest.</b> Most participants performed four test. Two of these tests were conducted with the fungicide Carbendazim (Formulation Derosal) and two with 4 -Nitrophenol. For each chemical one test was designed according to an ECx approach and the other according to a NOEC approach. Several courses and workshops were organised to inform and train the participants. Six <b>Ringtest</b> newsletters (RTL) were prepared and distributed to all participants during the project. A task force consisting of 6 members supported the organisation of the <b>Ringtest.</b> A major aspect {{of the project was}} the detailed statistical evaluation of the test results. Additionally, these results are thought to be an important contribution to the recent discussion on ecotoxicological test design. As a result of the <b>Ringtest,</b> the ERT Draft Guideline, which losely follows formal requirements of the OECD test guidelines programme, was significantly improved. (orig.)

40|$|Bread {{winter wheat}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} cash crops for French organic farmers. Nevertheless, most of varieties available on the market were bred for conventional farming systems (with high inputs of mineral fertilizers and chemicals for crop defense). In order to obtain correct levels of yield and quality, it is important i) to screen current varieties to find the best suited for organic conditions, and ii) to rapidly obtain suitable varieties that are specifically bred for organic farming conditions. Bread wheat variety trials under organic conditions have been coordinated since the year 2001, to centralize and evaluate results at national level. The <b>ringtest</b> not only aims to compare varieties, but also to support organic breeding, as it provides an opportunity to evaluate the ability of advanced lines bred for organic farming to meet the needs of farmers and millers for agronomic and quality traits. Trials are also used to study specific traits required for organic farming (such as weed competitiveness), so that they can become selection criteria in specific breeding programmes. In addition, protocols and results obtained in variety trials in organic farming give information to discuss about possibility of low input VCU testing (Value for Cultivation or Use) ...|$|E
40|$|An EU project, FAIR 5 -CT- 1997 - 3443, {{has been}} {{undertaken}} to distinguish illegal use of zeranol from consumption of food contaminated with Fusarium spp. toxin. One {{of the tasks}} was development of screening and confirmatory methods of analysis. This paper describes a new method based on two-step clean-up and GC-MS analysis. The first clean-up step is matrix-dependant; the second is applicable to both urine and meat. The MS is operated in negative chemical ionisation mode. The method is quantitative for zeranol and taleranol, alpha- and beta-zearalenol, and zearalenone and qualitative for zearalanone. Validation was performed {{according to the latest}} EU performance criteria (Commission Decision 2002 / 657). For analysis of urine CC(alpha) and CC(beta) for the method (microg L(- 1)) were 0. 06 - 0. 11 for zeranol, 0. 07 - 0. 12 for taleranol, 0. 07 - 0. 11 for alpha-zearalenol, 0. 21 - 0. 36 for beta-zearalenol, 0. 35 - 0. 60 for zearalenone, and 0. 19 - 0. 33 zearalanone. Within-laboratory reproducibility was 16. 2, 11. 2, 31. 9, 30. 1, 26. 6, and 54. 2 % for zeranol, taleranol, alpha-zearalenol, beta-zearalenol, zearalenone, and zearalanone, respectively. It was found that all the compounds are stable in urine at - 20 degrees C for at least a year. Part of the validation program was organisation of a small proficiency study (<b>ringtest)</b> and a correlation study with an LC-MS-MS method developed by the Veterinary Science Division (VSD; Belfast, UK-NI).

40|$|Dit rapport beschrijft de resultaten van een in 1995 georganiseerde cooperatieve studie ' 17 beta-estradiol in runderserum'. Het doel van deze <b>ringtest</b> was het evalueren van de huidige analytische mogelijkheden van verantwoordelijke controlerende laboratoria, zowel Routine- of Veldlaboratoria (RFL) als Nationale Referentie Laboratoria (NRL) met betrekking tot de controle op aanwezigheid van residuen van 17 beta-estradiol. Voor dit doel werden vijf gevriesdroogde monsters serum, met verschillende massa concentraties 17 beta-estradiol, bereid en gedistribueerd over 19 deelnemende laboratoria. Twee verschillende technieken werden gebruikt: (radio) immunochemische methoden en methoden gebaseerd op gas chromatografie-massaspectrometrie (GC-MS). De laboratoria die werkten met een GC-MS-methode vonden massa concentraties met een Z-score tussen - 2 and + 2 (Z < 2). Dit betekent dat er goede overeenstemming was tussen de laboratoria. De meeste laboratoria die een (R) IA-methode toepasten vonden concentraties met een Z-score tussen - 2 and + 2 (goede overeenstemming onderling). Een klein aantal laboratoria rapporteerden een afwijkend resultaat (2 < Z < 3). This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} a cooperative study organised in 1995. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the analytical possibilities within the responsible control laboratories (Routine or Field Laboratories (RFLs) and National Reference Laboratories (NRLs) with respect to the control for residues of 17 beta-estradiol. For this purpose five different samples of lyophilised bovine serum, containing different mass concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol, were prepared and distributed among 19 participating laboratories. The laboratories were asked to analyse the samples with their in-house procedures. The evaluation is based on Z-scores, a quantitative value describing the difference between an individual value from the overall average value, in relation to the standard deviation of the population of results. As for GC-MS all laboratories found mass concentrations with a Z-score between - 2 and + 2 (Z < 2) indicating good agreement between laboratories. As for (R) IA most laboratories found mass concentrations with a Z-score between - 2 and + 2 indicating good agreement.
