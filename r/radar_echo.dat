25|$|Later in the war, the Norden was {{combined}} with other systems to widen the conditions for successful bombing. Notable among these was the radar system called the H2X (Mickey), which were used directly with the Norden bombsight. The radar proved most accurate in coastal regions, as the water surface and the coastline produced a distinctive <b>radar</b> <b>echo.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{investigation}} {{identified a}} combination of erroneous information, in relation to en-route reporting points {{and the existence of}} a <b>radar</b> <b>echo</b> from another aircraft that overflew the Sabadell NDB {{at the same time as}} the Dan-Air crew mistakenly reported passing it, as the accident's probable cause. This combination resulted in an involuntary error on the part of both ATC and aircraft that could not be corrected by the time the air traffic controller realised that his instructions to the aircraft's crew were given in response to a mutual misunderstanding, which resulted from a navigational error on the crew's part that had gone unnoticed.|$|E
40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} are provided for sensing two-dimensional identification marks provided on a substrate or {{embedded within a}} substrate below a surface of the substrate. Micropower impulse radar is used to transmit a high risetime, short duration pulse to a focussed radar target area of the substrate having the two dimensional identification marks. The method further includes the steps of listening for <b>radar</b> <b>echoes</b> returned from the identification marks during a short listening period window occurring a predetermined time after transmission of the radar pulse. If <b>radar</b> <b>echoes</b> are detected, an image processing step is carried out. If no <b>radar</b> <b>echoes</b> are detected, the method further includes sequentially transmitting further high risetime, short duration pulses, and listening for <b>radar</b> <b>echoes</b> from each of said further pulses after different elapsed times {{for each of the}} further pulses until <b>radar</b> <b>echoes</b> are detected. When <b>radar</b> <b>echoes</b> are detected, data based on the detected echoes is processed to produce an image of the identification marks...|$|R
40|$|The {{dependence}} of mesospheric VHF <b>radar</b> <b>echoes</b> during summer months on geomagnetic activity {{has been investigated}} with observation data of the OSWIN radar in Kühlungsborn (54 &deg; N) and of the ALWIN radar in Andenes (69 &deg; N). Using daily mean values of VHF <b>radar</b> <b>echoes</b> and of geomagnetic activity indices in superimposed epoch analyses, the comparison of both data sets shows in general stronger <b>radar</b> <b>echoes</b> {{on the day of}} the maximum geomagnetic activity, the maximum value one day after the geomagnetic disturbance, and enhanced <b>radar</b> <b>echoes</b> also on the following 2 – 3 days. This phenomenon is observed at middle and polar latitudes and can be explained by precipitating particle fluxes during the ionospheric post storm effect. At polar latitudes, the <b>radar</b> <b>echoes</b> decrease however during and one day after very strong geomagnetic disturbances. The possible reason of this surprising effect is discussed...|$|R

The telescope was also used to receive messages bounced off the Moon (a [...] "moonbounce") {{as part of the}} 50th anniversary First Move festival. In April 1961, a <b>radar</b> <b>echo</b> from Venus was achieved using {{the telescope}} while the planet was at a close approach, confirming measurements of the distance of the planet made by American telescopes.|$|E
500|$|The BWER is {{a nearly}} {{vertical}} channel of weak <b>radar</b> <b>echo,</b> surrounded {{on the sides}} and top by significantly stronger echoes. The BWER, sometimes called a vault, {{is related to the}} strong updraft in a severe convective storm that carries newly formed atmospheric particulates, called hydrometeors, to high levels before they can grow to radar-detectable sizes. BWERs are typically found at mid-levels of convective storms, [...] to [...] above the ground, and are a few kilometers in horizontal diameter. Identifying the location of the updraft region is important because it is linked to locations where severe weather normally occurs. The presence of a BWER has been part of a method to diagnose thunderstorm strength as part of the Lemon technique since 1977. The updraft strength within the BWER supports the growth of large hailstones just above the vault, which can be displaced slightly into the direction of motion of the parent supercell storm.|$|E

The wood-and-fabric-construction of the Po-2 gave only a minimal <b>radar</b> <b>echo,</b> making it hard for an opposing fighter pilot to acquire his target. As Korean war U.S. veteran Leo Fournier remarked about [...] "Bedcheck Charlie" [...] in his memoirs: [...] "... no one could get at him. He just flew too low and too slow." [...] On 16 June 1953, a USMC AD-4 from VMC-1 piloted by Major George H. Linnemeier and CWO Vernon S. Kramer shot down a Soviet-built Polikarpov Po-2 biplane, the only documented Skyraider air victory of the war. The Po-2 is also the only biplane credited with a documented jet-kill, as one Lockheed F-94 Starfire was lost while slowing down to 110mph – below its stall speed – during an intercept in order to engage the low flying Po-2.|$|E
2500|$|While {{carrying}} out the left turn as instructed, the crew reported in error that they had passed the Sabadell NDB.

50|$|With radar, {{relative}} distance measurements (by {{timing of}} the <b>radar</b> <b>echo)</b> and relative velocity measurements (by measuring the doppler effect of the <b>radar</b> <b>echo)</b> are possible. However, the returned signal strength from radar decreases rapidly, as the inverse fourth power of the range to the object. This limits radar observations to objects relatively near the Earth, such as artificial satellites and Near-Earth objects.|$|E
40|$|Polarimetric weather <b>radar</b> <b>echoes</b> {{resulting}} from an observed resolution volume are commonly defined {{to be the}} composite of echoes from {{a large number of}} individual randomly distributed hydrometeors and refractive index irregularities of the atmosphere. In this contribution we shall examine some important statistical aspects of polarimetric weather <b>radar</b> <b>echoes.</b> The statistical properties of polarimetric weather <b>radar</b> <b>echoes</b> are readily obtained from basic principles, most of them are well known and their properties, {{from the point of view}} of interpretation of weather radar observables, are important features. Using time series weather radar data recorded with the coherent polarimetric C-band weather radar “POLDIRAD” (DLR, Wessling, Germany) allows us to examine the statistical properties of polarimetric weather <b>radar</b> <b>echoes</b> and also enables us to examine the dependence of the statistical properties of measured polarimetric weather radar signals on instrumental features. The proposed analysis can be used to detect possible radar-hardware malfunctions and can also serve as a diagnostic tool for validating or trouble-shooting radar hardware modifications...|$|R

50|$|Development of {{the high}} {{locations}} was difficult and led to delays in the start-up. Experience with chaff {{has already been done}} and could be considered. However, the recording from flying objects in the area with constant <b>radar</b> <b>echo</b> (for example, in large-scale <b>radar</b> <b>echo</b> of a mountain which is located in the line of sight of the radar behind the flying object) is problematic and could only be improved by improve the electronic components. As such, the SFR system was only in use for about 10 years before it was replaced by the FLORIDA Airspace monitoring and management system.|$|E
5000|$|A further {{uncertainty}} {{arises from}} <b>radar</b> <b>echo</b> measurements at the Arecibo Radio Telescope, which could only {{pick up an}} unexpectedly weak <b>radar</b> <b>echo,</b> implying that [...] is either smaller than estimated or reflects radio waves only weakly. In the former case {{it would have to}} have an unusually high albedo. This would be evidence in support of the speculation that it, or at least the material of which it is composed, is different from most other asteroids so far discovered on near-Earth orbits, or represents a fragment thrown off by the collision of a medium-sized asteroid with the Earth or the Moon.|$|E
50|$|Polar mesospheric summer echoes (PMSE) is the {{phenomenon}} of anomalous <b>radar</b> <b>echoes</b> found between 80-90 km in altitude from May through early August in the Arctic, and from November through to February in the Antarctic.

30|$|An {{efficient}} vibration {{estimation method}} for {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) systems based on phase-analysis method is presented. Small vibrations, which consist of multiple frequency components and are usually rather weak, introduce phase modulation in <b>radar</b> <b>echoes.</b> They contain important signatures of objects. Extracting and analyzing the phase from <b>radar</b> <b>echoes</b> {{is one of the}} significant approaches to acquire vibration characteristics. In order to separate different targets in different range cells, the proposed method acts the range compression and range migration correction on the <b>radar</b> <b>echoes,</b> followed by extracting the phase history of each target’s <b>radar</b> <b>echoes.</b> Since the phase history contains the time-varying ranges from the targets to airborne radar besides the vibration signal, we apply wavelet transform to the phase history to extract the vibration signal. Then the vibration signatures would be estimated quantitatively. The method is a more efficient and convenient approach to estimate the vibration amplitudes and frequencies of one or more targets, whose vibration signal is a single-frequency or multi-frequency signal. Moreover, it can be applied in the case where the airborne radar moves along the desirable or undesirable trajectory. Simulation results indicate that this method provides a larger range of estimable vibration frequency, higher estimation precision, and lower computation complexity.|$|R
