40|$|Within {{the human}} T-cell {{receptor}} δ (TCRD) gene {{we have identified}} a new cluster of seven δ recombining elements (δRec 2. 1 – 2. 7), located 2 · 6 – 5 · 2 kilobases downstream of the Vδ 2 gene segment. The δRec 2 elements are isolated recombining signal sequences (RSS), which were shown to rearrange with the Dδ 3 and Jδ 1 segments of the TCRD gene {{as well as with}} the ψJα of the TCRA gene. <b>Rearrangements</b> involving the δRec 2 elements were found in all peripheral blood (PB) samples from 10 healthy individuals, although their frequency was about 100 -fold lower than that of classical δRec <b>rearrangements.</b> The total frequency of δRec 2 <b>rearrangements</b> was lower in PB T lymphocytes, as compared with thymocytes, suggesting that they are deleted during T-cell development. The decrease of the frequency of the δRec 2 -Dδ 3 <b>rearrangements</b> was most prominent: 11 times lower in PB T lymphocytes than in thymocytes. Since the δRec 2 -Jδ 1 <b>rearrangements</b> contained the Dδ 3 segment in the junctional region, we assume that they are derived from the δRec 2 -Dδ 3 <b>rearrangements.</b> In contrast, the majority of δRec 2 -ψJα <b>rearrangements</b> did not contain the Dδ 3 segment, indicating that they are single step <b>rearrangements.</b> The δRec 2 -Jδ 1 and δRec 2 -ψJα <b>rearrangements</b> seem to be T-lineage specific, but the δRec 2 -Dδ 3 <b>rearrangements</b> were also found at very low frequencies in B lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Our results suggest that δRec 2 <b>rearrangements</b> are transient steps in the recombinatorial process of the TCRAD locus and are probably deleted by subsequent Vα-Jα <b>rearrangements.</b> We hypothesize, that in a similar manner to the classical δRec <b>rearrangements,</b> the δRec 2 <b>rearrangements</b> might also contribute to T-cell differentiation towards the TCR-αβ lineage...|$|R

In 5 % of cases the DH-JH <b>rearrangements</b> were the sole IGH gene <b>rearrangements.</b> Sequence analysis of the 31 identified incomplete <b>rearrangements</b> revealed preferential usage of segments from the D(H) 2, D(H) 3 and D(H) 7 families (78 %). While D(H) 2 and D(H) 3 gene <b>rearrangements</b> occur frequently in normal B cells and B cell precursors, the relatively frequent usage of D(H) 7 - 27 (19 %) in precursor-B-ALL patients is suggestive of leukemic transformation during prenatal lymphopoiesis. Among J(H) gene segments in the incomplete DH-JH <b>rearrangements,</b> the J(H) 6 segment was significantly overrepresented (61 %).

We have sampled human colonic lamina propria plasma cells and naive and memory B cell subsets from human Peyer’s patches by microdissection of immunohistochemically stained tissue sections and used PCR methods and sequence analysis to compare IgV�J � <b>rearrangements</b> in the plasma cell and B cell populations. <b>Rearrangements</b> that were either in-frame or out-of-frame between V and J were compared. Usage of IgV � families in the in-frame <b>rearrangements</b> from the plasma cells resembled that observed in the mantle cells, suggesting that antigenic selection for cellular specificity does not dramatically favor any particular V � segment. However, in marked contrast, out-of-frame <b>rearrangements</b> involving V� 1 and V� 2 families are rarely observed in intestinal plasma cells, whereas <b>rearrangements</b> involving V� 5 are increased.

Out-of-frame <b>rearrangements</b> of IgV�J � from plasma cells, including those involving the V� 5 family, have a significant tendency not to involve J� 1, consistent with the hypothesis that this population includes <b>rearrangements</b> generated by secondary recombination events.

MYC <b>rearrangements</b> correlated with germinal center B-cell origin (P= 0. 02), MYC protein expression (P= 0. 032), and larger tumor mass size (P= 0. 0003). Patients with MYC <b>rearrangements</b> {{were more likely to be}} treatment resistant (P< 0. 0001). All types of MYC <b>rearrangements</b> were associated with poorer disease-specific survival, that is, 20 / 39 dead, median disease-specific survival 42 months, compared with 98 / 393 dead among the non-rearranged cases, median disease-specific survival not reached (P= 0. 0002).

40|$|Molecular <b>rearrangements</b> occupy {{center stage}} in the {{development}} of organic synthesis and, consequently, in the impressive achievements that have resulted in the total synthesis of many complex natural products in the last decades. The purpose of this chapter, in this volume of a book series dedicated to the Studies in Natural Product Chemistry, is to show a set of selected and organized molecular <b>rearrangements</b> based on a personal choice of expertise related to the synthesis of complex bioactive molecules. Our selection addresses [3, 3]-sigmatropic <b>rearrangements,</b> which continue to provide excellent opportunities for reaching high chemical diversity, operating in efficient synthetic schemes. [3, 3]-Sigmatropic <b>rearrangements,</b> such as the Cope and Claisen <b>rearrangements,</b> are among the most basic and useful transformations in synthetic organic chemistry. This is possibly {{due to the fact that}} these <b>rearrangements</b> are efficient methods for the synthesis of quaternary, sterically hindered chiral centers, and for the stereoselective formation of carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds. In addition, [3, 3]-sigmatropic <b>rearrangements</b> can be easily integrated in, and adapted to, cascade processes as a simple method to prepare complex molecules in atom-efficient reactions. Consequently, in the context of [3, 3]-sigmatropic <b>rearrangements,</b> we focus on the transformations of propargylic esters, whose <b>rearrangements,</b> in different experimental conditions, have been largely exploited for the synthesis of interesting key and useful intermediates. The <b>rearrangements</b> can be promoted by protic acids, Lewis acids, and noble metals such as Pt, Au, or Cu salts, or complexes that have recently emerged as the most popular and potent electrophilic activators of alkynes toward a number of nucleophilic agents, under homogeneous conditions.

Methods DNA diagnostics of large genomic <b>rearrangements</b> was based on Multiple Ligation dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA).
