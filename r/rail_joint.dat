40|$|Insulated <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> are {{a safety}} valve in {{railways}} {{that are used}} {{as part of the}} signalling system to determine the position of a train. Insulated <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> are the weakest part of the railroad, where their life ranges between a third and half of the life of rails. One of the most significant issues in insulated <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> is metal flow, and damage and loss of the end post.

40|$|Abstract: Adhesively bonded {{insulated}} <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> {{are used}} to electrically isolate sections of track into discrete blocks to detect the positions of trains, and are sometimes useful in detecting rail breaks. Recent advances in high-strength rails allow {{for the use of}} higher-weight cars. With this increased axle loading of the freight lines, bonded <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> are encountering early breakdown through either electrical or mechanical failure. Service lives as short as 12 – 18 months have been reported on some rail lines, significantly lower than the lifetime of other railway components. The cost of replacing the joints has significantly increased the desire for a joint with improved durability. Commercially available bonded <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> are typically double butt-strap joints consisting of two steel reinforcing joint bars, bonded to the rails with an epoxy adhesive that may contain a fibreglass or aramid cloth layer. This paper investigates a tapered bonded joint that was proposed to reduce the high stresses that can result in the more typical butt-strap joint configuration. The first type of analysis models the <b>rails</b> and <b>joint</b> bars as beams, and the adhesive and ground as distributed elastic springs. Approximate solutions are obtained {{with the use of the}} Rayleigh–Ritz method. The finite-element method is used in the second type of analysis. Deflections, bending moments, andstresses areobtained. Basedon theseanalyses, tapered insulated joints shouldpro-vide some advantages over conventional insulated <b>rail</b> <b>joints,</b> such as lower deflections, bending moments, and shear stresses in the adhesive...|$|R

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{extensive}} usage of continuous welded rails, a number of <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> still exist in the track. Although {{a number of them}} exist as part of turnouts in the yards where the speed is not of concern, the Insulated <b>Rail</b> <b>Joints</b> (IRJs) that exist in ballasted tracks remain a source of significant impact loading. A portion of the dynamic load generated at the <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> due to wheel passage is transmitted to the support system which leads to permanent settlements of the ballast layer with subsequent vertical misalignment of the sleepers around the <b>rail</b> <b>joints.</b> This vertical misalignment of the adjacent sleepers forms a source of high frequency dynamic load raisers causing significant maintenance work including localised grinding of railhead around the joint, re-alignment of the sleepers and/or ballast tamping or track component renewals/repairs. These localised maintenance activities often require manual inspections and disruptions to the train traffic leading to significant costs to the rail industry. Whilst {{a number of studies have}} modelled the effect of joints as dips, none have specifically attended to the effect of vertical misalignment of the sleepers on the dynamic response of <b>rail</b> <b>joints.</b> This paper presents a coupled finite element track model and a rigid body track vehicle interaction model through which the effects of vertical misalignment of sleepers on the increase in dynamic loads around the IRJ are studied. The finite element track model is employed to determine the generated dip from elastic deformations as well as the vertical displacement of sleepers around the joint. These data (dip and vertical misalighments) are then imported into the rigid body vehicle-track interaction model to calculate the dynamic loads...|$|R

40|$|Insulated <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> are {{designed}} {{in a similar}} way to butt jointed steel structural systems, the difference being a purpose made gap between the main rail members to maintain electrical insulation for the proper functioning of the track circuitry at all times of train operation. When loaded wheels pass the gap, they induce an impact loading with the corresponding strains in the railhead edges exceeding the plastic limit significantly, which lead to metal flow across the gap thereby increasing the risk of short circuiting and impeding the proper functioning of the signalling and broken rail identification circuitries, of which the joints are a critical part. The performance of insulated <b>rail</b> <b>joints</b> under the passage of the wheel loading is complex due to the presence of a number of interacting components and hence is not well understood. This paper presents a dynamic wheel-rail contact-impact modelling method for the determination of the impact loading; a brief description of a field experiment to capture strain signatures for validating the predicted impact loading is also presented.
