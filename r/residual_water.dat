25|$|Mud flows (lahars) are remobilized {{hydrated}} ash deposits from pyroclastic {{flows and}} ash fall deposits, moving downslope even at very shallow angles at high speed. Because {{of their high}} density {{they are capable of}} moving large objects such as loaded logging trucks, houses, bridges, and boulders. Their deposits usually form a second ring of debris fans around volcanic edifices, the inner fan being primary ash deposits. Downstream of the deposition of their finest load, lahars can still pose a sheet flood hazard from the <b>residual</b> <b>water.</b> Lahar deposits can take many months to dry out, until they can be walked on. The hazards derived from lahar activity can exist several years after a large explosive eruption.|$|E

In this paper is studied a very efficient way to purify the <b>residual</b> <b>waters</b> using natural ions exchangers. There are made a series of studies above the zeolites, as a class of specific structure silicates. The main characteristic of the zeolites is the presence of some loose water molecules, the conceding and readmission of these being done without any damage to the crystal lattice. The paper contains a kinetic study regarding the copper’s elimination from the <b>residual</b> <b>waters,</b> using the Mirşid volcanic tuff.

25|$|When {{initially}} mixed, Portland {{cement and}} water rapidly form a gel of tangled chains of interlocking crystals, and {{components of the}} gel continue to react over time. Initially the gel is fluid, which improves workability and aids in placement of the material, but as the concrete sets, the chains of crystals join into a rigid structure, counteracting the fluidity of the gel and fixing the particles of aggregate in place. During curing, the cement continues to react with the <b>residual</b> <b>water</b> {{in a process of}} hydration. In properly formulated concrete, once this curing process has terminated the product has the desired physical and chemical properties. Among the qualities typically desired, are mechanical strength, low moisture permeability, and chemical and volumetric stability.|$|E

[...] This third reaction occurs more abundantly in reactors that increase the residence time of the reactive gases and organic materials, as well as heat and pressure. Catalysts are used in more sophisticated reactors to improve reaction rates, thus moving the system closer to the reaction equilibrium [...] for a fixed residence time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. More {{and more}} often, in {{treating}} waters associated with mining projects, {{it is not}} acid rock drainage that {{is the focus of}} concern. Consequently, we have coined a new phrase “mining influenced waters ” to include all the types of water that can be encountered. These waters can be divided into four categories. For acid rock drainage (ARD) the primary treatment problem is the elimination of mineral acidity in the form of soluble iron and aluminum. For mineral processing waters, the water is usually basic and the primary treatment problem is usually the elimination of cyanide, arsenic and selenium. For marginal waters, the water is circum-neutral but contains contaminants slightly above aquatic standards. For these waters, the treatment problem is often reducing small concentrations of contaminants in high flows of <b>water.</b> Finally, for <b>residual</b> <b>waters,</b> the primary treatment problem is the removal of high levels of total dissolved solids. For <b>residual</b> <b>waters,</b> there are few treatment options and these waters are becoming a serious environmental problem in some mining operations.
