5000|$|France 2 {{announced}} on 9 February 2017 {{that they would}} participate at the contest with the song [...] "Requiem", performed by Alma.

It was reported on 21 February 2017 that Alma and her production team were producing a bilingual version of [...] "Requiem"—the two languages being French and English—which implies that France 2 have not been disqualified from the contest.|$|R

50|$|The {{event was}} unusual in that no gold medal was awarded. The final match between Ahlgren and Böhling was {{declared}} a draw {{after more than}} 9 hours of wrestling.

5000|$|Despite this achievement, Ilanit stated {{she feels}} the song could have placed higher with {{revealing}} an argument she had with composer Hirsh over her own desire for a composition which [...] "attacks" [...] the listener by starting with the refrain, exploiting the three-minute limitation <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contest's</b> entries, against Hirsh decision to compose the intro as [...] "something artistic and mysterious".|$|R

50|$|Russian officials, {{including}} multiple MPs and Maria Zakharova, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, {{were clearly}} {{unhappy with the}} decision and said the song was a political statement and an allusion on the 2014 annexation of Crimea, forbidden by the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contest.</b> They threatened to boycott the 2017 contest. Despite this, Russia's entrant Sergey Lazarev congratulated Jamala on her win.|$|R

50|$|By that time, the Reformation {{had already}} removed the {{religious}} solemnities formerly observed and {{replaced them with}} programmes of recreational activities. Owing to the combination of betting, feasting, and drinking, parish festivals built up a reputation for their rowdiness. The local, rural nature of the fairs also occasioned many variations in the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contests,</b> leading to disagreements between parishes. The fairs had mostly died out by the 1860s.|$|R
50|$|Near {{the end of}} {{the first}} day, Julien Tinnes and Sami Koivu (remote) {{successfully}} exploited Firefox and Safari on OS X with a vulnerability in Java. At the time, OS X had Java enabled by default which allowed for reliable exploitation against that platform. However, due to having reported the vulnerabilities to the vendor already, Tinnes' participation fell outside the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contest</b> and was unable to be rewarded.|$|R
50|$|Sweden {{has hosted}} the Eurovision Song Contest six times {{and is the}} only country to have hosted the event in five {{different}} decades, three times in Stockholm (1975, 2000, and 2016), twice in Malmö (1992 and 2013) and once in Gothenburg (1985).Together with Croatia and Malta it was the only country to never be relegated, under the previous <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contest,</b> that wasn't a part of the Big Four.|$|R

5000|$|After the contest, [...] "Run Away" [...] {{would also}} become {{the subject of}} a major {{internet}} meme surrounding the saxophone solos performed by saxophonist Sergey Stepanov who, in a phenomenon similar to Rickrolling and Trololo, was dubbed the [...] "Epic Sax Guy" [...] in videos on YouTube. The <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contest</b> prohibited musical instruments being played on stage, meaning Stepanov was not actually playing the saxophone at all, but rather synchronising movements with a prerecorded track.|$|R
500|$|The {{contest is}} {{produced}} {{each year by}} the European Broadcasting Union.

25|$|If an EBU Active Member {{wishes to}} {{participate}} they must fulfil conditions as {{laid down by}} the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contest.</b> A separate copy is drafted annually. As of 2015, this included the necessity to have broadcast the previous year's programme within their country. After Russia's withdrawal from the 2017 event in Ukraine, and Channel 1 Russia's refusal to air the event, there is some confusion as to whether this rule still exists. C1R has announced that they intend to enter in 2018.|$|R
50|$|Rechter {{served in}} the Israeli Artillery Corps band.

Kaveret had {{represented}} Israel in the 1974 Eurovision Song <b>Contest.</b> As the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contest</b> only allowed for 6 on-stage performers (Kaveret had 7 members), Rechter was asked to be the conductor of their entry.
