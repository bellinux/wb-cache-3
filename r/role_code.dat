5000|$|The {{interaction}} is [...] "what the system does." [...] The {{interaction is}} implemented as Roles which are played by objects at run time. These objects combine {{the state and}} methods of a data (domain) object with methods (but no state, as Roles are stateless) from one or more Roles. In good DCI style, a Role addresses another object {{only in terms of}} its (methodless) Role. There is a special Role called [...] which binds to the object playing the current <b>Role.</b> <b>Code</b> within a Role method may invoke a method on [...] and thereby invoke a method of the data part of the current object. One curious aspect of DCI is that these bindings are guaranteed to be in place only at run time (using a variety of approaches and conventions; C++ templates can be used to guarantee that the bindings will succeed). This means that interactions, the Role methods, are generic. In fact, some DCI implementations use generics or templates for Roles.|$|E

40|$|Key words: code switching, used, by bawean community. The {{background}} of this thesis, {{language is a}} tool we use to communicate with other people. It is a social aspect of human life, a fundamental part of human in society, and a form behavior. Obviously, language plays its important role in human life. In daily conversation, it is impossible that the people just speak with the regional people that used regional language. Sometimes they will face reality that force them to speak in varieties of language. By using the variants of languages can support the people to make the conversation or interaction more fluently. As a matter of fact, Bawean community in Tulungagung switch their language when they communicate to Javanese interlocutor. The formulation of the research problem: 1) What are the types of code switching used by Bawean community to their Javanese interlocutors? 2) What are the factors of Bawean community used code switching in their interaction to Javanese interlocutors? 3) What are the <b>roles</b> <b>code</b> switching of Bawean community in Tulungagung? The purpose of this study: 1) to know the types of code switching used by Bawean community to their Javanese interlocutors? 2) To know the factors of Bawean community used code switching in their interaction to Javanese interlocutors. 3) To know the <b>roles</b> <b>code</b> switching of Bawean community in Tulungagung. The research method: 1) the research {{of this study is}} quantitative survey. 2) the population of this study was the Bawean community in Tulungagung. 3) the sample is part of Bawean community in Tulungagung that consist of 50 people. 4) The research instruments is the researcher it self, observation, documentation, interview, and questionnaire, observation guide, interview guide, questionnaire guide. 5) Data analysis technique. The research finding: 1) The types code switching used by Bawean community to their Javanese interlocutors are situational code switching, metaphorical code switching, inter sentential switching, intern code switching, and tag switching. 2) The factors of Bawean community used code switching in their communication to Javanese interlocutors are caused of the speaker, the interlocutor, the presence participant, the topic discussion, humorous usage, and prestigious usage. 3) The <b>roles</b> <b>code</b> switching of Bawean community in Tulungagung are as a language alternation, improve social interaction, express group identity, address a different audience, and being emphatic about something...|$|R

50|$|Implementation {{techniques}} differ across programming languages. What {{is common}} to many approaches is that Roles are represented by such constructs as generics, templates, classes, or traits. Code for the basic domain logic is implemented separately, following conventional object-oriented practice and most commonly using classes. Each <b>Role's</b> <b>code</b> is injected into the domain object that will play it during the use case enactment. To implement Roles, method injection is usually needed. Traits are one common programming language technique to support method injection. Some languages, such as Scala, have native support for traits, while other languages (e.g., Ruby and Python) allow run time injection of methods. In Java, pre-compiler tricks based on annotations are needed to support DCI.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{study the}} <b>role</b> of <b>codes</b> in the {{optimization}} {{and design of}} a large-scale Video-on-Demand (VoD) system based on distributed caching, that we have architected and built at Berkeley. We show how network codes can convert a combinato-rial problem into a tractable one, and enable a fully distributed algorithm that jointly optimizes the three-fold problem of cache content placement, cache-to-users topology selection, and cache-to-users rate-allocation. While {{a description of the}} general VoD system optimization and design can be found in [1], this paper focuses on the critical <b>role</b> of <b>codes</b> in enabling our VoD system. Specifically, we motivate and describe a specific class of network codes, called DRESS codes, that offer desirable tradeoffs between cache-to-user and cache-to-cache communication aspects of the problem needed to sustain a scalable VoD system.

40|$|I {{argue that}} Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), {{particularly}} the corporate code of conduct, {{has been one}} of global business’ preferred strategies for quelling popular discontent with corporate power. By “business strategy” I mean organized responses, through organizations like the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), to the threat public regulation poses to business’s collective self-interest.

In this essay I outline two periods of corporate crisis, and account for the <b>role</b> <b>codes</b> have played in quieting public concern over increasing corporate power: 1) When developing countries along with Western unions and social activists were calling for a ‘New International Economic Order’ that would more tightly regulate the activity of Transnational Corporations (1960 - 1976); and 2) When mass anti-globalization demonstrations and high profile corporate scandals are increasing the demand for regulation (1998 -Present) ...|$|R

In recent years, the growth of extreme programming (XP) has brought considerable attention to collaborative programming. Developed over a 15 year period by Kent Beck and his colleagues, Ron Jeffries and Ward Cunningham [1], XP is a computer software development approach that credits much of its success {{to the use of}} pair programming by all programmers, regardless of experience [9]. The pair programming dimension of XP requires that teams of two programmers work simultaneously on the same design, algorithm, code, or test. Sitting shoulder to shoulder at one computer, one member of the pair is the “designated driver, ” actively creating code and controlling the keyboard and mouse. The “non-driver ” constantly reviews the keyed data in order to identify tactical and strategic deficiencies, including erroneous syntax and logic, misspellings, and implementations that don’t map to the design.

40|$|Context: "Code smell" is {{commonly}} presented as indicative {{of problems in}} design of object-oriented systems. However, some empirical studies have presented findings refuting this idea. One of the reasons of the misunderstanding is the low number of studies focused {{on the role of}} human on code smell detection. Objective: Our aim is to build empirical support to exploration of the human <b>role</b> on <b>code</b> smell detection. Specifically, we investigated strategies adopted by developers on god class detection. God class {{is one of the most}} known code smell. Method: We performed a controlled experiment and replicated it. We explored the strategies from the participant's actions logged during the detection of god classes. Result: One of our findings was that the observation of coupling is more relevant than the observation of attributes like LOC or complexity and the hierarchical relation among these. We also noted that reading source code is important, even with visual resources enha ncing the general comprehension of the software. Conclusion: This study contributes to expand the comprehension of the human <b>role</b> on <b>code</b> smell detection through the use of automatic logging.

40|$|Context: Code smells define {{potential}} problems in design of software. However, some empirical {{studies on the}} topic have shown findings in opposite direction. The misunderstanding is mainly caused by lack of works focusing on human <b>role</b> on <b>code</b> smell detection. Objective: Our aim is to build empirical support to exploration of the human <b>role</b> on <b>code</b> smell detection. Specifically, we investigated what issues in code make a human identify a class as a code smell. We called these issues decision drivers. Method: We performed a controlled experiment and replicated it twice. We asked participants to detect god class (one of the most known smell) on different software, indicating what decision drivers they adopted. Results: The stronger drivers were "class is high complex" and "method is misplaced". We also found the agreement on drivers' choice is low. Another finding is: some important drivers are dependent of alternative support. In our case, "dependency" was an important d river only when visual resources were permitted. Conclusion: This study contributes with the comprehension of the human role on smell detection through the exploration of decision drivers. This perception contributes to characterize what we called the "code smell conceptualization problem"...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} a {{language}} sample {{is to determine the}} level of the child’s development. It is important to observe the stages of his/her development in relation to the “norm. ” Nonetheless, a sample transcript is not necessarily representative of the child’s ability. Factors such the child being too shy or too tired may contribute to inaccuracy of the transcript. It is possible that the child is capable of a lot more than he/she is demonstrating throughout the transcript. Furthermore, when evaluating the child’s language development, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic analysis are looked at. There are multiple factors, however, when evaluating the development of Russian speaking children. Unlike for English speaking children, there is hardly any data available for Russian children’s norms. Typically, when examining a language sample obtained from an English speaking child, one would pay attention to the Mean Length of Utterance, which is a number of morphemes that the child produces during each utterance, Brown’s fourteen morphemes, Templin’s Type – Token Ration, Semantic <b>Roles</b> <b>Coding</b> Sheet, and the pragmatic analysis (Retherford, 2000).
