5|$|At {{one point}} during the battle, the flag Moultrie had {{designed}} and raised over the fort was shot down. Sergeant William Jasper reportedly <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> battlement and raised the flag again, holding it up and rallying the troops until a flag stand could be provided. He was credited by Moultrie with reviving the troops' spirits, and later given commendations for bravery. A painting of this event (pictured above) depicts Jasper's actions.|$|E
5|$|On September 5, 2009, in Michigan's {{season opener}} against Western Michigan, Robinson scored a {{touchdown}} {{on his first}} collegiate (fumbled) snap. As the ESPN television broadcast focused on his untied shoelaces, Robinson took the snap in the shotgun formation, <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right, broke a tackle at the 40-yard line, then cut left and ran 43 yards for a touchdown.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} human activity in the area is {{the remains of a}} Roman road which served as the route between Roman camps at Coccium (Wigan) and Mamucium (Manchester). The road <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north of Astley, past Keeper Delph and through Tyldesley. Evidence for the presence of Anglo-Saxons in the sparsely populated, heavily wooded and isolated region is provided by place names incorporating the Old English suffix leah, such as in Leigh, Tyldesley, Shakerley and Astley.|$|E
5|$|The station {{building}} on Railton Road was opened in 1862 by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway. Initial service {{was only to}} Victoria, but by 1869 services <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> City of London, King's Cross, Kingston via Wimbledon, and Kent, including express trains to Dover Harbour for continental Europe. The arrival of the railways transformed Herne Hill from a wealthy suburb with large residential estates into a densely populated urban area.|$|E
5|$|After {{the second}} match ended, Rick Rude and the Junkyard Dog {{made their way}} to the ring. Their match began as Rude {{attacked}} Junkyard Dog from behind, who retaliated by headbutting Rude several times. Subsequently, Rude climbed to the wrestling ring's top rope and pulled down his tights to reveal another pair of tights with a picture of Cheryl Roberts on them. As a result, Jake Roberts, Cheryl Roberts' husband, <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ring and attacked Rude, forcing the referee to disqualify the Junkyard Dog.|$|E

5|$|André faced Hogan for {{the title}} on the February 5, 1988 {{broadcast}} of The Main Event, with Dave Hebner as the scheduled referee. André pinned Hogan to win the championship and handed the belt to DiBiase. The pinfall was controversial, however, as Hogan's shoulders {{were not on the}} mat when the referee made the three count. After the match, the real Dave Hebner, who looked identical to referee that had officiated the match, <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ring to attack the impostor referee. Hulk Hogan then threw the impostor out of the ring onto DiBiase and his bodyguard Virgil. According to the storyline, DiBiase had paid an unnamed referee to get plastic surgery to look exactly like Dave Hebner. In reality, the second referee was Dave's twin brother Earl Hebner, who was making his on-screen debut with the WWF.|$|E
5|$|As the {{combined}} Texian force prepared for battle, they sent a messenger to instruct the alcalde {{of the city}} to surrender. At 11pm, the alcade responded that the town would remain neutral, neither surrendering nor fighting. Several of the locals did, however, supply axes to the Texian militia. The Texians divided themselves into four groups, each assigned a different approach to the presidio. In the pre-dawn hours of October 10, the Texians attacked. The lone sentinel managed to give the alarm but was immediately shot dead. The Texians quickly hacked through a door on the north wall of the fortress and <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> interior courtyard. Hearing the commotion, the Mexican soldiers had lined the walls to defend the fort.|$|E
5|$|From 1911 to 1941 {{women were}} {{forbidden}} from {{serving in the}} RAN; the demands World War II placed on personnel and resources led to a change of policy. On 21 April 1941, the Australian Naval Board sent a letter authorising the entry of women into the <b>RAN</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Commodore-in-Charge, Sydney. The letter {{led to the formation}} of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service (WRANS) and the Royal Australian Naval Nursing Service (RANNS). The two separate women's services existed until 1984, when they were incorporated into the permanent force. Today, female members of the RAN have a wide variety of roles open to them; women serve on submarines, command ships and shore postings and are expected to play an increasingly important role in the future of the RAN.|$|E

5|$|Immense {{quantities}} {{of dust and}} coal rose {{high into the air}} in an inverted cone...In the village of Heworth, this cloud caused a darkness like that of early twilight and covered the roads so thickly that the footsteps of passengers were deeply imprinted in it. As soon as the explosion was heard, wives and children of the workmen <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pit. Wildness and terror were pictured in every countenance. The crowd soon collected to several hundreds, some crying out for a husband, others for a parent or a son, and all affected by a mixture of horror, anxiety and grief.|$|E
5|$|In the 77th minute, Keenor, Ferguson and Davies {{passed the}} ball among {{themselves}} before playing it wide to Thirlaway. Ferguson <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> centre {{and the ball}} was crossed towards him. Ferguson leapt and headed {{the ball into the}} net to equalise for Cardiff. It looked like Cardiff were about to go ahead, however, a last minute tackle by Alfred Bower prevented Ernie Curtis from scoring, giving the Welsh team another corner. The ball was fired towards the goal mouth, and was shot into the goal from close range by Davies putting Cardiff ahead. The final two attacks of the game were both by Cardiff, with Russell saving a header by Ferguson and then Curtis firing the ball over the crossbar.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Maryland {{advanced}} to the Oklahoma 20-yard line, and Tatum elected for a field goal attempt. Now against the wind, the kick failed, with the ball going wide right. The Sooners took over on downs and halfback Jack Ging completed a pass to end Max Boydston for a five-yard gain. Ging then rushed for threeyards. On the next play, Calame pitched to Grigg who <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left and picked up 12yards for a first down. Calame then completed a pass to back Bob Burris for sixyards. Grigg faked a pass and <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right for a gain of 12yards and a first down on the Maryland 39-yard line. The Terrapins stopped two Sooner rushing attempts before Calame connected with Burris again for an 11-yard gain. Burris then rushed for threemore yards {{to advance to the}} Maryland 25. Tatum called a time-out. On third down with oneyard to go, Calame faked a handoff to Ging and executed an option run to the left. He pitched to Grigg and threw a block. Grigg was tackled at the goal-line but managed to extend his body into the endzone. Buddy Leake made the extra point. Shortly before halftime, Calame suffered a separated collarbone. With back-up Pat O'Neal also injured, only third-string quarterback Jack Van Pool remained, and he had little game experience.|$|E

5|$|On July 11, a {{crowd of}} 10,000 people met Fox in Toronto, where he was honoured in Nathan Phillips Square. As he <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> square, he was joined on the road by many people, {{including}} National Hockey League star Darryl Sittler, who presented Fox with his 1980 All-Star Game jersey. The Cancer Society estimated it collected $100,000 in donations that day alone. As he continued through southern Ontario, he was met by Hockey Hall of Famer Bobby Orr who presented him with a cheque for $25,000. Fox considered meeting Orr the highlight of his journey.|$|E
5|$|On the January 1, 2007 {{episode of}} Raw, Maria {{attempted}} to interview Kevin Federline, but was instead slapped by Melina.

In the following weeks she faced Melina in two tag team matches, where she won one.|$|E
5|$|The Baptists had {{sustained}} {{injuries in}} its opening {{game against the}} Georgia Bulldogs, and their practice schedule was hampered by rain. Near {{the end of the}} first quarter, Godchaux finally got off a good punt to Mercer's 10-yard line and Tom Ryan made the tackle. Godchaux returned Mercer's punt ten yards, beginning a drive gaining six yards off-tackle. On the next play Doc Kuhn passed to Tot McCullough for twelve yards and first down on the nine-yard line. Rupert Smith <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> five-yard line, and then to the two. Red Williams fumbled on the next play, but it was recovered by Alf Sharpe in the end zone.|$|E

5|$|The Holmenkollen Line was {{the first}} light rail line, which opened in 1898 and ran west of the city. Later light rail lines in the west were the Røa Line (opened in 1912), the Lilleaker Line (1919), the Sognsvann Line (1934) and the Kolsås Line (1942). From 1928, they <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city centre via the Common Tunnel. East of the city, the Ekeberg Line opened in 1917, {{followed}} by the Østensjø Line (opened in 1926) and the Lambertseter Line (1957). The light rail lines were built by three private companies, Holmenkolbanen, Ekebergbanen and Bærumsbanen. By 1975, all had been bought by Oslo Sporveier.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Texas in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a third down-and-three situation at its 47-yard line. On the first play of the quarter, Brown completed a first-down pass to wide receiver Matt Davis at the Tech 47-yard line. After a Texas pass was batted down, Mitchell <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left for a gain of two yards. On third down, Brown was pressured by the Virginia Tech defense and threw an interception to Virginia Tech's William Yarborough, who caught the ball at the Tech 31-yard line.|$|E
5|$|The halt was {{approached}} {{from the road}} by a path leading up the embankment on which the railway <b>ran.</b> <b>To</b> <b>the</b> west, a bridge carried the line over Northrepps Road from where it proceeded on another embankment before reaching Cromer Tunnel which was built by the Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway to take the line under the Great Eastern's Cromer High to Norwich route.

However, as Barsham Tunnel was opened out before 1912, Cromer Tunnel is actually the only tunnel.|$|E
