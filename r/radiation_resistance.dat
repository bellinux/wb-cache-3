5|$|ZnO has wide direct {{band gap}} (3.37 eV or 375nm at room temperature). Therefore, its most common {{potential}} applications are in laser diodes and light emitting diodes (LEDs). Some optoelectronic applications of ZnO overlap with that of GaN, which has a similar bandgap (~3.4 eV at room temperature). Compared to GaN, ZnO has a larger exciton binding energy (~60 meV, 2.4 times of the room-temperature thermal energy), which results in bright room-temperature emission from ZnO. ZnO can be combined with GaN for LED-applications. For instance as transparent conducting oxide layer and ZnO nanostructures provide better light outcoupling. Other properties of ZnO favorable for electronic applications include its stability to high-energy radiation and its possibility to be patterned by wet chemical etching. <b>Radiation</b> <b>resistance</b> makes ZnO a suitable candidate for space applications. ZnO is the most promising candidate {{in the field of}} random lasers to produce an electronically pumped UV laser source.|$|E

These have a very low <b>radiation</b> <b>resistance</b> (and a high capacitive reactance) making them inefficient antennas. More of a transmitter's current is dissipated as heat due to the finite resistance of the conductors which is greater than the <b>radiation</b> <b>resistance.</b> However they can nevertheless be practical receiving antennas for longer wavelengths.|$|E

If ohmic losses in the conductors are neglected, the <b>radiation</b> <b>resistance</b> (considered relative to the feedpoint) is identical to the resistive (real) component of the feedpoint impedance. Unfortunately this exercise tells us nothing about the reactive (imaginary) component of feedpoint impedance, whose calculation is considered below.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{electron}} temperature on the radiation {{fields and the}} resistance of a short dipole antenna embedded in a uniaxial plasma have been studied. It is found that for ω ω_p the antenna excites two separate modes of radiation. One of the modes is the electromagnetic mode, while the other mode is of hot plasma origin. A characteristic interference structure is noted in the angular distribution of the field. The far fields are evaluated by asymptotic methods, while the near fields are calculated numerically. The effects of antenna length ℓ, electron thermal speed, collisional and Landau damping on the near field patterns have been studied. The input and the <b>radiation</b> <b>resistances</b> are calculated and are shown to remain finite for nonzero electron thermal velocities. The effect of Landau damping and the antenna length on the input and <b>radiation</b> <b>resistances</b> has been considered. The radiation condition for solving Maxwell's equations is discussed and the phase and group velocities for propagation given. It is found that for ω ω_p the hot plasma mode has similar characteristics. ...|$|R

Radiation induced attenuation measured in two single-mode fibre types shows discrepancies when coiled around a low bending radius spool: the observed attenuation is lower than expected. A series of dedicated tests reveals that this invalid measurement {{is related to the}} displacement of the mode field towards the cladding when the fibre is bent with a low radius, and to the different <b>radiation</b> <b>resistances</b> of the core and cladding glasses. For irradiation tests of optical fibres, the spool radius should therefore be carefully chosen...|$|R
25|$|Dipoles whose {{length is}} {{approximately}} half the wavelength {{of the signal}} are called half-wave dipoles and are widely used as such or {{as the basis for}} derivative antenna designs. These have a <b>radiation</b> <b>resistance</b> which is much greater, closer to the characteristic impedances of available transmission lines, and normally much larger than the resistance of the conductors, so that their efficiency approaches 100%.

Sporogenesis by the biphasic system was more rapid, convenient, and economical, and yielded as many or more heat-resistant (80 C, 10 min) spores per milliliter as by the conventional technique. Of several aqueous phases [thiamine-hydrochloride, yeast extract, (NH 4) 2 SO 4] tested with strain 62 A, the highest spore colony counts were obtained with 2. 0 % (NH 4) 2 SO 4.

40|$|Among Field-Coupled technologies, NanoMagnet Logic (NML) {{is one of}} {{the most}} promising. Low dynamic power consumption, total absence of static power, {{remarkable}} heat and <b>radiations</b> <b>resistance,</b> in association with the possibility of combining memory and logic in the same device, make this technology the ideal candidate for low power, portable applications. However, the necessity of using an external magnetic field to locally control the circuit represents, currently, the weakest point of this technology. The high power losses in the clock generation system adopted up to now wipes out the most important advantages of this technology. In this chapter we discuss a clock system based on a piezoelectric actuator that allows electrical control of NanoMagnet Logic circuits. The low power consumption coupled with the fact that electric fields are easier to generate at the nanoscale level makes this clock system a strong candidate as the final and effective clocking mechanism for this technology. Another remarkable advantage of the proposed solution resides in its compatibility with currently available technology...|$|R

The unpolished materials used in the heater tests showed poor performance leading to loss of a signi­ficant percentage of the input power. The present work deals with the refur­bishment of the radiation heat shields used in a furnace for heating graphite structure. The effect of refurbishment of the heat shields by the buffing and subsequently electro­polishing was found to improve the performance of the shields as heat reflectors. The com­position of the electrolyte was chosen in such a way that the large shields of Mo, Inconel and SS can be polished using the same reagents in different ratios. The present work deals with the development of a standard electropolishing procedure for large metallic sheets and subsequently qualifying them by roughness and emissivity measure­ments. The improvement noted in the shielding efficiency of the furnace in the subsequent runs is also discussed here. </span...|$|R
