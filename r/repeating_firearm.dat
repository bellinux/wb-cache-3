5000|$|The pepper-box {{revolver}} {{or simply}} pepperbox (also [...] "pepper-pot", from its {{resemblance to the}} household pepper grinder) is a multiple-barrel <b>repeating</b> <b>firearm</b> that has three or more barrels grouped around a central axis. It mostly appears {{in the form of}} a multi-shot handheld firearm. Pepperboxes exist in all ammunition systems: matchlock, wheellock, flintlock, percussion, pinfire, rimfire and centerfire.|$|E
50|$|A {{single shot}} firearm {{can only be}} fired once per {{equipped}} barrel before it must be reloaded or charged via an external mechanism or series of steps. A <b>repeating</b> <b>firearm</b> can be fired multiple times, but can only be fired once with each subsequent pull of the trigger. Between trigger pulls, the firearm's action must be reloaded or charged via an internal mechanism.|$|E
50|$|The Winchester Repeating Arms Company was a {{prominent}} American maker of <b>repeating</b> <b>firearms,</b> located in New Haven, Connecticut. The Winchester brand {{is owned by the}} Olin Corporation and the name is used under license by two subsidiaries of the Herstal Group; Fabrique Nationale (FN) of Belgium and the Browning Arms Company of Ogden, Utah.|$|R
25|$|A {{revolver}} {{works by}} having several firing chambers {{arranged in a}} circle in a cylindrical block that are brought into alignment with the firing mechanism and barrel one at a time. In contrast, other <b>repeating</b> <b>firearms,</b> such as bolt-action, lever-action, pump-action, and semi-automatic, have a single firing chamber and a mechanism to load and extract cartridges into it.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{firearms}} are [...] "single shot": i.e., {{each time}} a cartridge is fired, the operator must manually re-cock the firearm and load another cartridge. The classic single-barreled shotgun is a good example. A firearm that can load multiple cartridges as the firearm is re-cocked is considered a [...] "repeating firearm" [...] or simply a [...] "repeater". A lever-action rifle, a pump-action shotgun, and most bolt-action rifles are good examples of <b>repeating</b> <b>firearms.</b> A firearm that automatically re-cocks and reloads the next round with each trigger pull is considered a semi-automatic or autoloading firearm.|$|R
50|$|A {{magazine}} is an ammunition storage and feeding device within or {{attached to a}} <b>repeating</b> <b>firearm.</b> Magazines can be removable (detachable) or integral to the firearm. The magazine functions by moving the cartridges stored in the magazine into {{a position where they}} may be loaded into the chamber by the action of the firearm. The detachable {{magazine is}} often referred to as a clip, although this is technically inaccurate.|$|E

50|$|The {{firing pin}} or striker is {{generally}} {{located in the}} bolt of a <b>repeating</b> <b>firearm.</b> Firearms {{that do not have}} bolts, such as revolvers and many types of single-shot actions, generally have a very short firing pin in the frame, or else attached to the hammer itself. These types of firearms are almost never striker fired, as there is insufficient space to house a striker mechanism. Strikers are most commonly found in semi-automatic pistols and bolt-action firearms.|$|E
50|$|Military use {{of combat}} {{shotguns}} through the 20th century {{has created a}} need for ammunition maximizing the combat effectiveness of such weapons within the limitations of international law. Twelve gauge has been widely accepted as an appropriate bore diameter to provide an effective number of projectiles within an acceptable recoil. Early 12 gauge popularity for sporting purposes produced {{a large number of}} <b>repeating</b> <b>firearms</b> designs readily adaptable to military purposes.|$|R
50|$|Caseless {{ammunition}} is {{an attempt}} to reduce the weight and cost of ammunition by dispensing with the case, which is typically precision made of brass or steel, as well as to simplify the operation of <b>repeating</b> <b>firearms</b> by eliminating the need to extract and eject the empty case after firing. Its acceptance has been hampered by problems with production expenses, heat sensitivity, sealing, and fragility. Its use to date has been limited to prototypes and low-powered firearms.|$|R
5000|$|While the Rocket Ball {{provided}} {{the means of}} making practical <b>repeating</b> <b>firearms,</b> {{it was not an}} ideal solution. The limited volume in the base of the bullet severely limited the amount of powder that could be used, and thus limited the potential velocity and range of the cartridge. With muzzle energy of only about 56 foot-pounds (76 joules), the Rocket Ball was less powerful than even the most feeble of modern [...] "pocket pistol" [...] cartridges, such as [...]25 ACP.|$|R
5000|$|Many modern {{single shot}} or break barrel [...]45-70 rifles {{can be easily}} reamed by a {{competent}} do-it-yourselfer to shoot [...]45-90 Express. These rifles include the Ruger No. 1, New England Firearms Buffalo Classic, and the Pedersoli Kodiak Mark IV. When used in modern <b>repeating</b> <b>firearm</b> such as a converted Marlin 1895, Enfield, or Winchester 1886 the cartridge overall length of the [...]45-90 Express needs be kept to under 2.85 inches to reliably cycle through the action.|$|E
5000|$|Lever {{action is}} a type of firearm action which uses a lever located around the trigger guard area (often {{including}} the trigger guard itself) to load fresh cartridges into the chamber of the barrel when the lever is worked. This contrasts to bolt-action, semi-automatic, or selective-fire weapons. Most lever-action firearms are rifles, but some lever-action shotguns and a few pistols have also been made. One of the most famous lever-action firearms is the Winchester Model 1873 rifle, but many manufacturers—notably Marlin and Savage—also produce lever-action rifles. Even Colt's Mfg. Co. produced 1883 until 1885 6403 lever-action Colt-Burgess rifles. Mossberg produces the 464 in centerfire [...]30-30 and rimfire [...]22. While the term lever-action generally implies a <b>repeating</b> <b>firearm,</b> it is also sometimes —and incorrectly— applied to a variety of single-shot or falling-block actions that use a lever for cycling, such as the Martini-Henry or the Ruger No. 1.|$|E
5000|$|The Colt Paterson is a revolver. It was {{the first}} {{commercial}} <b>repeating</b> <b>firearm</b> employing a revolving cylinder with multiple chambers aligned with a single, stationary barrel. Its design was patented by Samuel Colt on February 25, 1836, in the United States, France, and England, and it derived its name from being produced in Paterson, New Jersey. Initially this 5-shot revolver was produced in [...]28 caliber, with a [...]36 caliber model following a year later. As originally designed and produced, no loading lever was included with the revolver; a user had to disassemble the revolver partially to re-load it. Starting in 1839, however, a reloading lever and a capping window were incorporated into the design, allowing reloading without requiring partial disassembly of the revolver. This loading lever and capping window design change was also incorporated after the fact into most Colt Paterson revolvers that had been produced from 1836 until 1839. Unlike later revolvers, a folding trigger was incorporated into the Colt Paterson. The trigger only became visible upon cocking the hammer.|$|E
50|$|The {{mounting}} {{civil war}} in Japan and the opposition of various feudal lords against the Bakufu during the Late Tokugawa Shogunate led to serious rearming until the 1867 Boshin War. At the same time, technological progress was extremely fast in the West, {{with the introduction of}} the rifle, breech-loading and even <b>repeating</b> <b>firearms,</b> so that Japanese armies were equipped with composite technologies, with weapons imported from countries as varied as France, Germany, The Netherlands, Britain and the United States, and coexisting with traditional Tanegashima guns.|$|R
50|$|Certain antique {{firearms}} (generally muzzle loading {{black powder}} flintlock firearms manufactured before 1 January 1901) can {{in some states}} be legally held without a licence. In other states {{they are subject to}} the same requirements as modern firearms. All single-shot muzzleloading firearms manufactured before 1 January 1901 are considered antique firearms. Four states require licences for antique percussion revolvers and cartridge <b>repeating</b> <b>firearms,</b> but in Queensland and Victoria a person may possess such a firearm without a licence, so long as the firearm is registered (percussion revolvers require a licence in Victoria).|$|R
5000|$|Though {{frequently}} {{classified as}} only single-shot firearms, one tilting block rifle usually {{falls under the}} category of <b>repeating</b> <b>firearms.</b> The Krag-Petersson Rifle, upon ejecting a round from the chamber, would load a round from the underbarrel magazine onto the loading surface of the tilting block, then raise it to the mouth of the chamber where the user could then easily push it forward into the chamber. Though this would not meet most standards of [...] "repeating" [...] for most modern users, the classification has been in use historically.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>repeating</b> <b>firearm</b> or [...] "repeater" [...] is {{a firearm}} that holds {{more than one}} {{cartridge}} and can be fired more than once between chargings. One example of a repeater is the American Springfield Model 1892-99—also made at the Springfield Armory in Springfield, Massachusetts—which were used during the Spanish-American War. Some repeating firearms require manipulation of a bolt (as in bolt action), lever, or slide to eject the fired cartridge case, draw a fresh cartridge from the magazine, and insert it into the firing chamber, and [...] "cock" [...] (draw to the rear and place under spring tension) the hammer or striker, so that pulling the trigger will fire the weapon. Others use either the firearm's recoil or {{a small portion of}} the propellant gas drawn from the barrel, to operate the firearm's mechanism and ready it for the next shot. Such firearms are sometimes called [...] "self-loading," [...] but are more commonly known as semi-automatic, if they fire one shot for every pull of the trigger, or automatic or [...] "full-auto" [...] if they continue to fire until the trigger is released and the magazine is empty.|$|E
5000|$|Horse archers were {{eventually}} rendered obsolete by the maturity of firearm technology. In the 16th and subsequent centuries, various cavalry forces armed with firearms gradually started appearing. Because the conventional arquebus and musket were too awkward for a cavalryman to use, lighter weapons {{such as the}} carbine had to be developed, that could be effectively used from horseback, much {{in the same manner}} as the composite recurve bow presumably developed from earlier bows. 16th-century Dragoons and Carabiniers were heavier cavalry equipped only with firearms, but pistols coexisted with the composite bow, often used by the same rider, well into the 17th century in Eastern European cavalry such as Muscovites, Kalmyks, Turks and Cossacks. Mounted archery remained an effective tactical system in open country until the introduction of <b>repeating</b> <b>firearms.</b> It has been proposed that firearms began to replace bows in Europe and Russia not because firearms were superior but because they were easier to use and required less practice [...] The Comanches of North America found their bows more effective than muzzle loading guns. [...] "After... about 1800, most Comanches began to discard muskets and pistols and to rely on their older weapons." [...] Bows were still used in the fighting that ended the freedom of Native Americans in the United States, but almost all warriors who had immediate access to modern <b>repeating</b> <b>firearms</b> used these guns instead.|$|R
5000|$|An {{exception}} to this trend was the Comanche culture of North America, where mounted archery remained competitive with muzzle-loading guns. [...] "After... about 1800, most Comanches began to discard muskets and pistols and to rely on their older weapons." [...] <b>Repeating</b> <b>firearms,</b> however, were superior in turn, and the Comanches adopted them when they could. Bows remained effective hunting weapons for skilled horse archers, used to some extent by all Native Americans on the Great Plains to hunt buffalo {{as long as there}} were buffalo to hunt. The last Comanche hunt was in 1878, and it failed for lack of buffalo, not lack of appropriate weapons.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{produced}} principally {{to satisfy the}} demands of the growing sport of long-range [...] "Match Shooting", which opened at Creedmoor, New York, on June 21, 1872. Target/Match shooting was extremely popular in the US from about 1871 until about 1917, enjoying a status similar to golf today, and the Winchester company, which had built its reputation on <b>repeating</b> <b>firearms,</b> had in 1885 challenged the single-shot giants of Sharps, Remington, Stevens, Maynard, Ballard [...] et al., not only entering the competition, but excelling at it, with Major Ned H. Roberts (inventor of the [...]257 Roberts cartridge) describing the Model 1885 Single Shot as [...] "the most reliable, strongest, and altogether best single shot rifle ever produced." ...|$|R
50|$|George H. Sharpe's {{replication}} {{of the success}} of the Bureau of Military Information with all Union Army groups and his formation of the Central Information Bureau was key in maintaining pertinent military knowledge to the various fronts. Additional combat multipliers were the resuscitation of the Union Army Balloon Corps under the ingenious scientist Thaddeus Lowe for real-time military intelligence spread by telegraph, the forced retirement of the ineffectual and sabotaging Army Ordinance Bureau Brigadier General James Ripley, and the reintroduction of <b>repeating</b> <b>firearms,</b> including the Spencer Repeating Rifle, the Coffee Mill Gun, and the Gatling Gun. The British and French entrance in the war infuriated large portions of the United States populace, and recruiting stations once more filled with veteran volunteers and Irish immigrants.|$|R
25|$|Losses {{were far}} higher than during the recent defeat of Mexico, which saw roughly {{thirteen}} thousand American deaths, including fewer than two thousand killed in battle, between 1846 and 1848. One reason for {{the high number of}} battle deaths during the war was the continued use of tactics {{similar to those of the}} Napoleonic Wars at the turn of the century, such as charging. With the advent of more accurate rifled barrels, Minié balls and (near the end of the war for the Union army) <b>repeating</b> <b>firearms</b> such as the Spencer Repeating Rifle and the Henry Repeating Rifle, soldiers were mowed down when standing in lines in the open. This led to the adoption of trench warfare, a style of fighting that defined much of World War I.|$|R
500|$|While {{long range}} rifles became the {{standard}} {{weapon in the}} 1830s, armies were slow to adapt their tactics and uniforms, perhaps {{as a result of}} mainly fighting colonial wars against less well armed opponents. Not until the First Boer War of 1880/81 did a major European power meet an opponent well equipped with and well versed in the use of modern long range <b>repeating</b> <b>firearms,</b> forcing an immediate change in tactics and uniforms. Khaki-coloured uniform became standard service dress for both British and British Indian Army troops stationed in British India in 1885, and in 1896 khaki drill uniform was adopted by British Army for the service outside of Europe in general, but not until the Second Boer War, in 1902, did the entire British Army standardise on khaki (officially known as [...] "drab") for Service Dress.|$|R
50|$|In {{military}} {{and law enforcement}} use, the bolt action has been mostly replaced by semi-automatic and selective-fire firearms, though the bolt action remains the dominant design in dedicated sniper rifles. Bolt-action firearms are still very popular for hunting and target shooting. Compared to most other manually operated firearm actions, it offers an excellent balance of strength (allowing powerful cartridge chamberings), ruggedness, reliability, and potential accuracy, all with light weight and much lower cost than self-loading firearms, and can also be disassembled and re-assembled much faster due to fewer moving parts. The major disadvantage is a slightly lower practical rate of fire than other manual <b>repeating</b> <b>firearms,</b> such as lever-action and pump-action firearms, and a far lower practical rate of fire than semi-automatic weapons, {{but this is not}} a very important factor in many types of hunting, target shooting, and other precision-based shooting uses.|$|R

50|$|Category B (restricted) {{includes}} semi-automatic or <b>repeating</b> short <b>firearms,</b> single-shot short centerfire firearms, single-shot rimfire firearms {{less than}} 28 cm overall, semi-automatic long firearms with greater than 3-round capacity (including the chamber) (or {{which can be}} converted to such), repeating and semi-automatic long firearms with smoothbore barrels less than 60 cm long, and semi-automatic firearms which resemble fully automatic weapons.|$|R
2500|$|The {{third factor}} {{was not as}} much a change of tactics, as an ability to inflict {{peripheral}} damage {{as a consequence of}} the changed battlefield dynamic, which resulted in the destruction of Comanche lodges, food supplies, and horse herds. [...] This left the survivors without even the most limited means to survive. [...] The killing of women and children had occurred before, on both sides, but this marked a watershed in terms of open use as of attacks on non-combatants as a tactic of war. [...] The Texans had had limited success against the Comanche until <b>repeating</b> <b>firearms</b> ended their battlefield domination, and new Ranger fighting tactics took the battle to the Comanche heartland. [...] In the face of the attack on their homeland, the Comanche were defeated and forced to retreat. Only Peta Nocona's leadership saved the day as he was able to retire skillfully enough that the entire battle disintegrated into a running individual gun battle over several miles.|$|R
2500|$|There were {{numerous}} technological innovations during the Civil War {{that had a}} great impact on 19th century science. The Civil War was one of the earliest examples of an [...] "industrial war", in which technological might is used to achieve military supremacy in a war. New inventions, such as the train and telegraph, delivered soldiers, supplies and messages at a time when horses were considered to be the fastest way to travel. It was also in this war when countries first used aerial warfare, in the form of reconnaissance balloons, to a significant effect. It saw the first action involving steam-powered ironclad warships in naval warfare history. <b>Repeating</b> <b>firearms</b> such as the Henry rifle, Spencer rifle, Colt revolving rifle, Triplett & Scott carbine and others, first appeared during the Civil War; they were a revolutionary invention that would soon replace muzzle-loading and single-shot firearms in warfare, as well as the first appearances of rapid-firing weapons and machine guns such as the Agar gun and the Gatling gun.|$|R
