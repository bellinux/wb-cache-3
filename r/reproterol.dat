40|$|Our {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{in order to}} evaluate hemodynamic effects of intravenous administration of <b>Reproterol</b> in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD). <b>Reproterol</b> is a monomulecolar combination of catecholamine and theophilline. Diastolic pulmonary pressure and wedge pressure decreased 20 minutes after <b>Reproterol</b> while total pulmonary resistances were reduced 10 minutes after drug administration; sistolic pulmonary pressure and cardiac index increased only after 10 minutes; heart rate increased until 15 th minute. <b>Reproterol,</b> as a catecholamine-theophylline combination, has an additional site of action {{over and above the}} pure catecholamine effect owing to inhibition of phosphodiesterase; so an increase in cAMP content is achieved either by increasing the synthesis or by blocking the breakdown. Our results assess that <b>Reproterol</b> has a beneficial effect on pulmonary hemodynamics in COLD...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the effect of inhaled adenosine on bronchomotor tone in 16 healthy and 24 allergic and non-allergic bronchopathic subjects. We determined the inhaled adenosine dose-response curves after no treatment and after treatment with aminophylline (240 mg in 10 min), <b>reproterol</b> (90 mcg in 2 min) and salbutamol (100 mcg in 2 min) administered intravenously 15 min before adenosine and <b>reproterol</b> (500 mcg) and salbutamol (200 mcg) administered by inhalation from a metered aerosol 30 min before adenosine on separate days. Without prior treatment, inhaled adenosine caused bronchoconstriction in both groups of subjects (normal, and atopic and non-atopic asthmatic ones), but the peripheral airways revealed only a moderate change in normal subjects. Aminophylline caused a greater inhibition of adenosine bronchoconstriction than did <b>reproterol.</b> These results suggest that inhaled adenosine bronchoconstriction involved purinergic transmission {{and that it is}} mediated via a P 1 /Ri (A- 1 /R 1) receptor. Aminophylline is a potent antagonist at purinoceptor level. <b>Reproterol</b> inhibits bronchoconstriction by a mechanism independent of its effect on beta-adrenergic receptors. Because salbutamol, i. e. a beta 2 -agonist bronchodilator, did not inhibit adenosine-induced bronchoconstriction (or very nearly so), our results support the view that <b>reproterol</b> antagonizes P 1 /Ri (A 1 /R 1) tracheobronchial receptors...|$|E
40|$|<b>Reproterol</b> is a {{synthetic}} selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist with a xanthine side chain. The bronchial and cardiovascular responses to inhaled <b>reproterol</b> were studied in 14 asthmatics. The study was placebo controlled and double-blind, comparing doubling doses of <b>reproterol</b> from 500 micrograms- 8 mg. The peak improvement in FEV 1 showed a non-linear dose-response, {{with an initial}} plateau at the 1 mg dose producing a mean increase in FEV 1 of 17 %, but significant further improvement at the 8 mg dose, producing a mean improvement of 29 % in FEV 1. The time taken for improvement in airways obstruction to start shortened with increasing doses. The duration of bronchodilation was dose-dependent, with the 8 mg dose showing a significantly longer duration of action than the lower doses. The time to drop below 75 % of the maximum achieved bronchodilation was 125 min, and was independent of the dose. There were no significant changes in pulse or blood pressure at any dose. The study shows that <b>reproterol</b> is a well tolerated selective beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonist whose duration of action and peak effect can be significantly increased by increasing the dose to 8 mg, without producing more unwanted effects...|$|E
40|$|The use of ß-agonists as growth {{promoters}} in cattle breeding is forbidden {{in many countries}} for reasons of fair trade and consumer protection. In recent years the use of liquid chromatography (LC) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) {{has been shown to}} be the method of choice for the control of ß-agonists. In this study an LC-MS/MS multiresidue analysis method is presented for trace analysis of 22 ß-agonists. A truly generic concept has been designed based on mixed-mode solid-phase extraction and positive electrospray ionisation LC-MS/MS operated in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. This method allows application to a wide variety of sample matrices such as urine, feed and hair, following minor modifications to the analysis procedure only. The method features fit-for-purpose sensitivity in urine as shown by CC¿ and CCß values of less than 0. 2 and less than 0. 5 ¿g/l respectively, for all ß-agonists studied (terbutaline and <b>reproterol,</b> less than 0. 3 and less than 1. 0 respectively). Similar but semiquantitative application to feed and hair showed CCß values of less than 10. 0 and less than 5. 0 ¿g/kg, respectively. A further simplification and improvement is demonstrated using Ultra Performance LC (UPLC¿) and fast-switching MS/MS. The successful validation of this method following the latest EU requirements and its application to real samples demonstrate that a new versatile tool has been achieved for veterinary control of ß-agonists...|$|E
40|$|A {{unification}} of doping-control screening procedures of prohibited small molecule substances—including stimulants, narcotics, steroids, ß 2 -agonists and diuretics—is highly urgent {{in order to}} free resources for new classes such as banned proteins. Conceptually this may be achieved {{by the use of}} a combination of one gas chromatography–time-of-flight mass spectrometry method and one liquid chromatography–time-of-flight mass spectrometry method. In this work a quantitative screening method using high-resolution liquid chromatography in combination with accurate-mass time-of-flight mass spectrometry was developed and validated for determination of glucocorticosteroids, ß 2 -agonists, thiazide diuretics, and narcotics and stimulants in urine. To enable the simultaneous isolation of all the compounds of interest and the necessary purification of the resulting extracts, a generic extraction and hydrolysis procedure was combined with a solid-phase extraction modified for these groups of compounds. All 56 compounds are determined using positive electrospray ionisation {{with the exception of the}} thiazide diuretics for which the best sensitivity was obtained by using negative electrospray ionisation. The results show that, with the exception of clenhexyl, procaterol, and <b>reproterol,</b> all compounds can be detected below the respective minimum required performance level and the results for linearity, repeatability, within-lab reproducibility, and accuracy show that the method can be used for quantitative screening. If qualitative screening is sufficient the instrumental analysis may be limited to positive ionisation, because all analytes including the thiazides can be detected at the respective minimum required levels in the positive mode. The results show that the application of accurate-mass time-of-flight mass spectrometry in combination with generic extraction and purification procedures is suitable for unification and expansion of the window of screening methods of doping laboratories. Moreover, the full-scan accurate-mass data sets obtained still allow retrospective examination for emerging doping agents, without re-analyzing the samples...|$|E
