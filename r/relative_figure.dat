Liquidity creation is also a better measure because it provides us the absolute amount rather than a <b>relative</b> <b>figure,</b> which is offered by loan growth. Furthermore, loans may grow faster based on the policies adopted by government and not as a result of excessive risk taking but increase in liquidity creation shows the true risk taken by banks, regardless of the government policy.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} pedestrian activity classification and gait analysis based on the microelectromechanical-systems inertial measurement unit (IMU). The work targets two groups of applications, including the following: 1) human activity classification and 2) joint human activity and gait-phase classification. In the latter case, the gait phase {{is defined as a}} substate of a specific gait cycle, i. e., the states of the body between the stance and swing phases. We model the pedestrian motion with a continuous hidden Markov model (HMM) in which the output density functions are assumed to be Gaussian mixture models. For the joint activity and gait-phase classification, motivated by the cyclical nature of the IMU measurements, each individual activity is modeled by a "circular HMM. " For both the proposed classification methods, proper feature vectors are extracted from the IMU measurements. In this paper, we report the results of conducted experiments where the IMU was mounted on the humans' chests. This permits the potential application of the current study in camera-aided inertial navigation for positioning and personal assistance for future research works. Five classes of activity, including walking, running, going upstairs, going downstairs, and standing, are considered in the experiments. The performance of the proposed methods is illustrated in various ways, and as an objective measure, the confusion matrix is computed and reported.

Under the Transuranic Waste Research and Development Program, a completed evaluation of stainless steel drums showed that although the material has superior corrosion-resistant properties, its higher cost makes a thorough investigation of other container systems mandatory. A program to investigate more economical, nonmetallic containers is proposed. Preliminary fire tests in mild steel drums have been completed with fire propagation not appearing {{to be a problem}} unless container integrity is lost. Investigation of the corrosion of mild steel drums and the evaluation of potential corrosion inhibitors, in a variety of humid environments, continues. Experimental results of both laboratory and field investigations on radiolysis of transuranic elements in hydrogenous waste are discussed.

Comparison to models reveals that the disks are best described by an inner radius between 0. 01 and 0. 07 AU, and a flared disk geometry with a flaring index between 1. 05 and 1. 2. Furthermore, we can exclude values of the disk scale-height lower than 10 AU (measured at a fiducial radius of 100 AU). We combined the Herschel data with recent ALMA {{observations of}} the brown dwarf GY 92 204 (ISO-Oph 102), and by comparing its SED to the same grid of disk models, we derived an inner disk radius of 0. 035 AU, a scale height of 15 AU with a flaring index of beta~ 1. 15, an exponent for dust settling of - 1. 5, and a disk mass of 0. 001 MSun.

40|$|Research {{questions}} and used data The aim of my thesis is simple but extensive. In addition to exact research aims I have analysed how the Finnish {{juvenile justice system}} differs from systems {{in which there is}} a juvenile court institution. A detailed comparison is made between Finland, England and Wales, and Germany. Research questions are as follows: Which typical questions arise when we are discussing juvenile crime? What are the special characteristics of juvenile criminal justice especially when compared with adult criminal justice? What are the main principles on which special arrangements concerning juvenile crime are based? How does offender s young age and his characteristics influence the types of punishments and other form of sanctions? What is the division of labour between criminal law and child welfare? What role does diversion play in each system and what does it concretely mean? What is the distribution of punishment types given to juveniles? The used data is extensive. It consists of legislation, official documents, and jurisprudential, criminological and comparative criminal policy literature. In empirical parts of the study statistics, enforcement documents, criminal records and court decisions (as well as empirical data from my previous research) are used. On comparative parts of the study I have been forced to settle for secondary sources. Findings At the beginning of the 21 st century a heated parliament debate concerning the age of criminal responsibility took place in Finland. The claim was to lower it. The results of this study suggest (as has been claimed several times before by specialists) that there are practically no reasonable grounds to reform. Finnish juvenile criminal justice has little to offer to minor s dysfunction and social problems on which childrens´ crime are mainly due to also since the child welfare authorities deal with these cases. Changes to age categories would only be reasonable if the orientation of juvenile criminal justice would be changed in favour of child welfare aspect. This would mean that a part of the tasks nowadays handled by the child welfare authorities would be reassigned to the juvenile criminal justice system. However, criminological research and experiences in other countries do not support this view either. The vast majority of penalties imposed by courts for all age-groups consist of fines in Finland. The younger the offender the higher the share of fines (75 % in age-group 15 17, 60 % in 18 20 and 55 % for offenders over 20 years). This is a quite exceptional characteristic in international comparison. In Germany the corresponding percentage of fines for juveniles is 11 and in England and Wales 20. Among the use of different community sanctions (fines not included) are huge differences between compared countries. In Finland the share of community sanctions is 24 %, in Germany 78 % (leisure-time arrest and short-term arrest included) and in England and Wales 74 %. Respectively the share of imprisonment is in Finland 1 %, in Germany 11 % (prison and long-term detention) and 7 % in England and Wales. However, the number of juveniles getting some kind of criminal sanction (diversion included) is somewhat higher in Finland than in England and Wales or in Germany. In England and Wales the <b>relative</b> <b>figure</b> (per 100 000, relevant population) of sanctioned juveniles is 7087 (2004), in Germany 8495 (2004) and in Finland 9311 (2004). This analysis tried to figure out the number of children 10 17 years who are placed in child welfare institution against their own will and with a background of delinquent history in Finland. It was estimated that there are about 100 (10 14 -years) and 150 (15 17 -years) delinquents minor in child welfare institutions. At the same time there are only few (typically 2 7) juvenile prisoners. In England and Wales and in Germany number of juvenile prisoner (aged 15 17, per 100 000 relevant population) is much higher than in Finland. In England and Wales the <b>relative</b> <b>figure</b> (per 100 000 relevant population, including remand) of juvenile prisoner is 124 (2006), in Germany 64 (2005) and in Finland 4 (2006). In Finland, overall prison rate is about 70 prisoner per 100 000 inhabitants. Difference between juvenile prison rate and overall prison rate is huge. In England and Wales and Germany there are no great differences on this matter. However, these figures are misleading because of the differences between systems. There are much more (about 150) delinquent juveniles placed in child welfare institutions in Finland than there are juvenile prisoners. The child welfare institutions in Finland are very small and home-like in contrast to juvenile prisons in Finland but especially in England and Wales, or in Germany. When child welfare figures are added to juvenile prisoners figures, we find that there are about 77 juveniles (per 100 000, relevant population) placed outside their home because of their delinquent behaviour in Finland. The corresponding figures are about 150 in England and Wales, and 73 in Germany. The German figure would double if we took into account the juveniles placed in youth detention centres. The conclusion follows; taking into account child welfare side of Finnish system the differences are reasonable and comparable. In Finnish juvenile justice system the child welfare measures are far more commonly used way of control juveniles than utilising punishments. One could characterize Finnish juvenile justice system compared to England and Wales and Germany as follows: there are no juvenile courts, the use of monetary penalties is high, the significance of prior sanction in sentencing is quite low, community penalties are not very intensive, sanctions concerning violation of the conditions of community sentences are quite lenient and the parents are not held responsible for their child s crimes. Maybe the most important feature is to react on juvenile crimes more in the context of child welfare instead of criminal justice. The comparison of juvenile justice systems without taking into consideration both criminal justice and child welfare systems is misleading. Väitöskirjassa tarkastellaan nuorten rikosten käsittelyä ja seuraamuksia Suomessa, Saksassa ja Englannissa. Teoksessa käsitellään nuorisorikosoikeudellisen sääntelyn kehityskaaria (luku II) sekä eritellään nuoriin sovellettavan rangaistusjärjestelmän perusteita ja tavoitteita (luku III). Luvussa IV esitetään vertailumaiden nuorten rikosten käsittelyjärjestelmien perusteiden kuvaukset, arvioidaan Suomen 15 vuoden rangaistusvastuuikärajan tarkoituksenmukaisuutta sekä tarkastellaan eri maiden nuorisorikollisuuden tasoja ja rangaistusten jakaumia. Teoksen laajimmassa luvussa V kartoitetaan nuoriin sovellettavien seuraamusten sääntelyratkaisut ja soveltamiskäytännöt vertailumaissa, sekä arvioidaan eri järjestelmien soveltamisesta saatuja kokemuksia pääosin tilastollisen materiaalin valossa. Luvussa VI pohditaan lastensuojelun ja rikosoikeuden rajapintaa. Aineistona on käytetty kotimaisia ja ulkomaisia virallisasiakirjoja ja oikeuskirjallisuutta, kriminologista, vertailevaa ja kriminaalipoliittista kirjallisuutta, tilastoja sekä useita empiirisiä aineistoja. Vertailun osalta on tyydytty sekundaarilähteisiin. Suomessa voimassa oleva 15 vuoden rangaistusvastuuikäraja on perusteltu. Sen muuttamiseen ei ole ilmennyt pitäviä perusteita. Sakkorangaistuksella on Suomessa poikkeuksellisen suuri asema nuorten rikosseuraamuksena. Nuorten avoseuraamuksia on Suomessa vähän ja niitä myös käytetään vähän. Ehdollisen vankeuden valvonnan ja nuorisorangaistuksen väljä sisältö paikkaavat osittain avoseuraamusten vähäistä määrää. Suomen avoseuraamukset eivät ole kansainvälisessä katsannossa kovin intensiivisiä. Vankilan käyttö nuorten rangaistuksena on Suomessa kriminaalipoliittisesti tarkoituksenmukaisella tavalla harvinaista. Jos alaikäiseen on välttämättä kohdistettava vapaudenrajoitustoimia, hänet tulee sijoittaa lastensuojeluun erikoistuneeseen laitokseen, ei vankilaan. Käytännössä Suomessa tapahtuu juuri näin. Alaikäisten lainrikkojien paikka ei ole vankilassa vaan lastensuojelun huollollisten toimien piirissä. Väitöskirjan keskeinen tulos on se, ettei pelkkien rikosoikeudellisten käytäntöjen vertailu ole mielekästä. Jotta Suomessa omaksuttu nuorisorikosoikeudellinen järjestelmä tulee oikein ymmärretyksi, rikosoikeuden ohella tulee huomioida lastensuojelun toimet, jotka ovat viime vuosina yleistyneet melko paljon. Suomessa on alaikäisiä vankeja vain muutamia, mutta ainakin osaksi rikosperusteella laitoksiin sijoitettuja nuoria on tutkimuksessa esitetyn arvion mukaan moninkertainen määrä, noin 150. Lastensuojelulain mukaiset toimet ovat rangaistusjärjestelmää merkittävästi laajemmin käytetty nuorisorikollisuuden tuki- ja kontrollimuoto.

40|$|Laser-induced {{breakdown}} spectroscopy (LIBS) is a portable, remote, non-invasive analytical technique which effectively distinguishes {{neutral and}} ionic species {{for a range}} of low- to high-Z elements in a multi-element target. Subsequently, LIBS holds potential in special nuclear material (SNM) sensing and nuclear forensics requiring minimal sample preparation and detecting isotopic shifts which allows for differentiation in SNM (namely U) enrichment levels. Feasible applications include not only nonproliferation and homeland security but also nuclear fuel prospecting and industrial safeguard endorsement. Elements of higher mass with complex atomic structures, such as U, however, result in crowded emission spectra with LIBS, and characteristic emission lines are challenging to discern. Preliminary research suggests double-pulse LIBS (DPLIBS) improves signal sensitivity for analytes of lower atomic mass over conventional single-pulse LIBS (SPLIBS). This study investigates signal sensitivity for low- and high-Z analytes in a glass matrix containing U (1. 3 %) comparing DPLIBS to SPLIBS. DPLIBS involves sequential firing of 1064 Nd: YAG (FWHM 9 ns) pre-pulse and 10. 6 µm TEA CO 2 (FWHM 50 - 100 ns) heating pulse in near collinear geometry; SPLIBS entails only the Nd:YAG laser.

5000|$|O'Callahan {{grew up in}} Brookline, Massachusetts, {{near the}} many {{hospitals}} of the Boston Longwood Medical Area, in a neighborhood which he has fictionalized in his stories as Pill Hill. He {{is the son of}} Edward J. and Helen Gately O'Callahan, two teachers who founded the Wyndham Secretarial and Finishing School on Marlborough Street in Boston's Back Bay, a women's secretarial college that sought to teach not only clerical skills but a broader liberal education. In the mid-1940s, his parents bought a 32-room mansion in Pill Hill built in 1883 for Charles Storrow and landscaped by Frederick Law Olmsted. As O'Callahan put it: They didn't have any money, they were teachers. But nobody wanted those big old houses because nobody wanted to heat them. So my parents bought it and didn't heat it."

The Servei d'Investigació i Estudis Sociolinguistics (Department for Research and Sociolinguistc Studies), an official centre of the Department of Education of the Valencian Government, carried out the interviews which have been used in this study in 1992, 1995, 2005 and 2010. With this data, we have studied the evolution of the knowledge, usage and attitude Valencian people have with regard to their language. In general terms, the evolution of Catalan is shown to be negative, and its usage is decreasing in social and private spheres. The reasons for this decrease – which can be observed in <b>relative</b> <b>figures</b> – can be justified, on one hand, by the arrival of a great number of immigrants in this period and, on the other, by the political change which took place in 1995 in the Valencian Government, which has meant a regression in the process of linguistic recovery...|$|R
50|$|The {{controversy}} {{over whether the}} more expensive rt-PA was clinically superior over streptokinase as a thrombolytic agent climaxed in the scientific press between 1988 and 1992. To end this controversy, the GUSTO trial (Global Utilization of Streptokinase and t-PA for Occluded Coronary Arteries) was set up, a head-to-head comparison between rt-PA and streptokinase. In the GUSTO-trial 41,021 heart attack patients were treated in 1,081 hospitals in 15 countries. Cardiologist Eric Topol of the Cleveland Clinic (USA), statistician Robert Califf of Johns Hopkins (USA) and David Stump https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=206572&privcapId=29617 of Genentech coordinated the trial. In absolute figures the 30-day mortality rate in the rt-PA group was 1% lower (or in <b>relative</b> <b>figures</b> 14%) compared to the mortality in the streptokinase group. After the GUSTO studies, rt-PA became the thrombolytic drug of choice {{for most of the}} cardiologists in the Western world and would save the lives of many tens of thousands of heart attack patients.|$|R

40|$|The {{floating}} point computation runs at the Central Information and Computing Complex (CICC) cluster of JINR accommodate requests for traditional sequential applications, parallel computing applications, {{as well as}} Grid applications launched within various virtual organizations. During {{the second half of}} 2008, the CICC JINR comprised a heterogeneous computing array of multicore processors with a total of 560 cores grouped in seven modules. Performance measurements made in 2007 and system exploitation evidenced the existence of bottlenecks which were identified and alleviated. As a result of the implemented optimizations, the system works efficiently for all three abovementioned categories of jobs. Within the Russian Data Intensive Grid (RDIG) consortium, which comprises, besides the CICC JINR, 14 Russian computing centres, our cluster covered a sizeable part of the RDIG share to the LHC projects during 2007 – 2008.

40|$|Many {{scientific}} and engineering problems involve physical modeling of complex processes. Sometimes multiple candidate models are available, and their performance {{can be compared}} by how well their outputs match observations. Various summary statistics {{can be used for}} this purpose, but no matter which statistics are chosen, it is important that comparisons based on them be considered in light of the inherent variability of the data used in their calculation. In this article, we consider the variability of a summary statistic through an empirical likelihood. The approach is nonparametric in the sense that a moving-block bootstrap procedure is used to obtain the empirical likelihood. <b>Relative</b> <b>figures</b> of merit for each candidate model are formed as the ratio of each candidate model 2 ̆ 7 s likelihood to the largest likelihood. We use a small simulation study to show that our procedure can correctly distinguish between different time series models, and then we demonstrate how the method can be used to evaluate the output of 20 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) atmospheric models based on their agreement with the observations...|$|R
