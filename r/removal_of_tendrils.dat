40|$|This {{study was}} carried out at Khulis, Khulis Governorate, Makkah region, {{on the first of}} April during the growing season of 2007, to study the {{morphology}} and anatomy <b>of</b> <b>tendrils</b> in different eight of cucurbit genera. The results showed a great variation among the most tested cucurbit genera concerning the twisting, branching, number <b>of</b> <b>tendrils</b> per node and presence <b>of</b> <b>tendril</b> trunk. Also, shape of transverse sections were ovate, sinuate-rhombic, sinuate-emarginate oblong, emarginate-ovate, spherical, notched-ovate and reniform. Furthermore, presence of collenchymatous, sclerenchymatous tissues, number of vascular bundles in Transverse Section (TV) and arrangement of vascular bundles varied according to the studied species. It could be conclude from this research that there are a numerous of qualitative traits <b>of</b> <b>tendrils</b> which {{plays an important role in}} identification of cucrbitaceous plants for examples; the twisting, branching, transverse section shape, collenchymatous tissue, scleranchymatous tissue, tylosis and arrangement of vascular bundles...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{here the}} presence of actin and myosin in pea (Pisum sativum L.) tendrils. The molecular weight <b>of</b> <b>tendril</b> actin is 43, 000, the same as rabbit skeletal muscle actin. The native molecular weight <b>of</b> <b>tendril</b> myosin is about 440, 000. Tendril myosin is composed of two heavy chains of molecular weight approximately 165, 000 and four (two pairs) light chains of 17, 000 and 15, 000. At high ionic strength, the ATPase activity <b>of</b> pea <b>tendril</b> myosin is activated by K+-EDTA and Ca 2 + and is inhibited by Mg 2 +. At low ionic strength, the Mg 2 +-ATPase activity <b>of</b> pea <b>tendril</b> myosin is activated by rabbit skeletal muscle F-actin.

40|$|A coiling-inducing {{factor was}} {{isolated}} from <b>tendrils</b> <b>of</b> Bryonia dioica Jacq. and identified by infrared, 1 H-, 13 C-nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry as a-linolenic acid. When applied to detached tendrils, exogenous a-linolenic acid, but not linoleic acid or oleic acid, induced tendril coiling. Further investigations showed that metabolites of a-linolenic acid, jasmonic acid and, even more so, methyljasmonate, are highly effective inducers <b>of</b> <b>tendril</b> coiling in B. dioica. Methyljasmonate was most active when administered by air and, in atmospheric concentrations {{as low as}} 40 – 80 nM, induced a full free-coiling response with kinetics similar to mechanical stimulation. Even atmospheric levels as low as 4 – 5 nM methyljasmonate were still {{found to be significantly}} active.

40|$|The helical coiling <b>of</b> plant <b>tendrils</b> has fascinated {{scientists}} for centuries, yet {{the underlying}} mechanism remains elusive. Moreover, despite Darwin’s widely accepted interpretation <b>of</b> coiled <b>tendrils</b> as soft springs, their mechanical behavior remains unknown. Our experiments on cucumber tendrils demonstrate that tendril coiling occurs via asymmetric contraction {{of an internal}} fiber ribbon of specialized cells. Under tension, both extracted fiber ribbons and old tendrils exhibit twistless overwinding rather than unwinding, with an initially soft response followed by strong strain-stiffening at large extensions. We explain this behavior using physical models of prestrained rubber strips, geometric arguments, and mathematical models of elastic filaments. Collectively, our study illuminates the origin <b>of</b> <b>tendril</b> coiling, quantifies Darwin’s original proposal, and suggests designs for biomimetic twistless springs with tunable mechanical responses...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Botrytis {{bunch rot}} {{is a disease}} that {{requires}} management under New Zealand conditions {{in order to prevent}} financial losses for wine grape producers. A survey was conducted to investigate the potential spore production <b>of</b> <b>tendrils</b> in 16 vineyards from the Marlborough and Hawke’s Bay wine growing regions. Significant differences in spore production potential <b>of</b> <b>tendrils</b> were detected between sampling before flowering and after fruit set. Significant regional differences were also detected, with tendrils from Marlborough producing fewer spores. Under ideal laboratory conditions for incubation of the fungus, spore production by tendrils was low {{at the start of the}} season and was reduced further following application of the industry standard fungicide programme. Based on these experiments and a review of other data it is recommended that tendril removal is not required at pruning as part of vineyard disease management...|$|R

40|$|Pea tendrils contain high {{concentrations}} of flavonoids, mainly quercetin-triglucosyl-p-coumarate (QGC).

5000|$|Characteristics of the Paestan style include decorations such as lateral palmettes, {{a pattern}} <b>of</b> <b>tendrils</b> with calyx and umbrel known as [...] "asteas flower", crenelation-like {{patterns}} on garments, and curly hair {{hanging over the}} back of figures. Figures that bend forwards, resting on plants or rocks, are equally common. Special colours are used often, especially white, gold, black, purple and shades of red.|$|R
60|$|<b>Tendrils</b> <b>of</b> {{which the}} {{extremities}} are permanently and slightly curved, are sensitive {{only on the}} concave surface; other tendrils, {{such as those of}} the Cobaea (though furnished with horny hooks directed to one side) and those of Cissus discolor, are sensitive on all sides. Hence the <b>tendrils</b> <b>of</b> this latter plant, when stimulated by a touch of equal force on opposite sides, did not bend. The inferior and lateral surfaces <b>of</b> the <b>tendrils</b> <b>of</b> Mutisia are sensitive, but not the upper surface. With branched tendrils, the several branches act alike; but in the Hanburya the lateral spur-like branch does not acquire (for excellent reasons which have been explained) its sensitiveness nearly so soon as the main branch. With most tendrils the lower or basal part is either not at all sensitive, or sensitive only to prolonged contact. We thus see that the sensitiveness <b>of</b> <b>tendrils</b> is a special and localized capacity. It is quite independent of the power of spontaneously revolving; for the curling of the terminal portion from touch does not in the least interrupt the former movement. In Bignonia unguis and its close allies, the petioles of the leaves, as well as the tendrils, are sensitive to a touch.|$|R

60|$|The {{position}} <b>of</b> the <b>tendrils</b> alone suffices to {{show their}} homological nature. In two instances one <b>of</b> two <b>tendrils</b> produced a flower at its tip; this, however, did not prevent its acting properly and curling round a twig. In a third case both lateral branches which {{ought to have been}} modified into tendrils, produced flowers like the central branch, and had quite lost their tendril-structure.|$|R
50|$|In {{the field}} of plant systematics, he used {{criteria}} such as stem structure and/or leaf arrangement as a basis of anatomical criteria. As a plant physiologist, he conducted investigations on the movement of leaves, the curling <b>of</b> <b>tendrils,</b> the effect <b>of</b> low temperatures on seed germination {{and the influence of}} ultraviolet radiation on flower formation. He was particularly interested in the botanical family Piperaceae.|$|R
60|$|The spiral {{contraction}} <b>of</b> <b>tendrils</b> {{is quite}} independent {{of their power}} of spontaneously revolving, for it occurs in tendrils, {{such as those of}} Lathyrus grandiflorus and Ampelopsis hederacea, which do not revolve. It is not necessarily related to the curling of the tips round a support, as we see with the Ampelopsis and Bignonia capreolata, in which the development of adherent discs suffices to cause spiral contraction. Yet in some cases this contraction seems connected with the curling or clasping movement, due to contact with a support; for not only does it soon follow this act, but the contraction generally begins close to the curled extremity, and travels downwards to the base. If, however, a tendril be very slack, the whole length almost simultaneously becomes at first flexuous and then spiral. Again, the <b>tendrils</b> <b>of</b> some few plants never contract spirally unless they have first seized hold of some object; if they catch nothing they hang down, remaining straight, until they wither and drop off: this is the case with the <b>tendrils</b> <b>of</b> Bignonia, which consist of modified leaves, and with those of three genera of the Vitaceae, which are modified flower-peduncles. But in the great majority <b>of</b> cases, <b>tendrils</b> which have never come in contact with any object, after a time contract spirally. All these facts taken together, show that the act of clasping a support and the spiral contraction of the whole length <b>of</b> the <b>tendril,</b> are phenomena not necessarily connected.|$|R
60|$|Sachs {{attributes}} all {{the movements}} <b>of</b> <b>tendrils</b> to rapid growth {{on the side}} opposite to that which becomes concave. These movements consist of revolving nutation, the bending {{to and from the}} light, and in opposition to gravity, those caused by a touch, and spiral contraction. It is rash to differ from so great an authority, but I cannot believe that one at least of these movements--curvature from a touch--is thus caused. {38} In the first place it may be remarked that the movement of nutation differs from that due to a touch, in so far that in some cases the two powers are acquired by the same tendril at different periods of growth; and the sensitive part <b>of</b> the <b>tendril</b> does not seem capable of nutation. One of my chief reasons for doubting whether the curvature from a touch is the result of growth, is the extraordinary rapidity of the movement. I have seen the extremity <b>of</b> a <b>tendril</b> <b>of</b> Passiflora gracilis, after being touched, distinctly bent in 25 seconds, and often in 30 seconds; and so it is with the thicker <b>tendril</b> <b>of</b> Sicyos. It appears hardly credible that their outer surfaces could have actually grown in length, which implies a permanent modification of structure, in so short a time. The growth, moreover, on this view must be considerable, for if the touch has been at all rough the extremity is coiled in two or three minutes into a spire of several turns.|$|R

60|$|All tendrils are sensitive, but {{in various}} degrees, to {{contact with an}} object, and curve towards the touched side. With several plants a single touch, so slight as only just to move the highly {{flexible}} tendril, is enough to induce curvature. Passiflora gracilis possesses the most sensitive tendrils which I have observed: a bit of platina wire 0.02 of a grain (1.23 mg.) in weight, gently placed on the concave point, caused a tendril to become hooked, as did a loop of soft, thin cotton thread weighing one thirty-second of a grain (2.02 mg.) With the <b>tendrils</b> <b>of</b> several other plants, loops weighing one sixteenth of a grain (4.05 mg.) sufficed. The point <b>of</b> a <b>tendril</b> <b>of</b> Passiflora gracilis began to move distinctly in 25 seconds after a touch, {{and in many cases}} after 30 seconds. Asa Gray also saw movement in the <b>tendrils</b> <b>of</b> the Cucurbitaceous genus, Sicyos, in 30 seconds. The <b>tendrils</b> <b>of</b> some other plants, when lightly rubbed, moved in a few minutes; with Dicentra in half-an- hour; with Smilax in an hour and a quarter or half; and with Ampelopsis still more slowly. The curling movement consequent on a single touch continues to increase for a considerable time, then ceases; after a few hours the tendril uncurls itself, and is again ready to act. When the <b>tendrils</b> <b>of</b> several kinds of plants were caused to bend by extremely light weights suspended on them, they seemed to grow accustomed to so slight a stimulus, and straightened themselves, as if the loops had been removed. It makes no difference what sort <b>of</b> object a <b>tendril</b> touches, with the remarkable exception <b>of</b> other <b>tendrils</b> and drops <b>of</b> water, as was observed with the extremely sensitive-tendrils of Passiflora gracilis and of the Echinocystis.
