An examination of <b>stock</b> <b>repurchase</b> announcements during the period 1994 to 1998 [SECOND DRAFT INCLUDES DATA TO 2002] indicate that stock prices do not adjust to pre announcement levels if the repurchases are not carried through.

40|$|We present {{univariate}} {{and multivariate}} {{evidence to show}} that firms which engage in initial <b>stock</b> <b>repurchases</b> have some specific economic and financial attributes when compared to size-and industry-matched firms. We find that initial repurchase firms are younger, have lower leverage and operating risk, and higher payouts, operating cash flows, profitability and market-to-book than matched non-repurchase firms. Compared to secondary or “seasoned” repurchase matched firms, these initial repurchase firms are also younger and have higher cash, profitability, sales growth and market-to-book, as well as lower payouts, leverage and retained earnings. Therefore, we analyze the determinants and motivations that may explain why firms <b>repurchase</b> their own <b>stock</b> for the first time by studying the theoretical hypotheses found in the financial literature that are most important in explaining initial <b>stock</b> <b>repurchases.</b> The results support the free cash flow and risk reduction signaling hypotheses and the flexibility motivation for conducting <b>stock</b> <b>repurchases.</b> We do not find strong support for any other theoretical explanations of <b>stock</b> <b>repurchases,</b> such as undervaluation signaling, timing, tax effects and options and dilution hypotheses. <b>Stock</b> <b>Repurchases,</b> Initial <b>Stock</b> Repurchases; Payout Policy, Theoretical Hypotheses. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{has three}} essays. In the first essay, I investigate whether {{the decision to}} <b>repurchase</b> <b>stock</b> is driven by investor demand for repurchases. Specifically, I hypothesize that firms cater to investor demand for repurchases by initiating repurchases when investors place premiums on the <b>stock</b> prices of <b>repurchasing</b> firms. I propose proxies (analogous to Baker and Wurgler (2004)) that measure the repurchase premium. I find that the lagged repurchase premium is positively and significantly related to repurchase initiation and continuation decisions, even after controlling for tax effects, year trends and alternate investment opportunities. I find that a greater fraction of dividend paying firms also <b>repurchase</b> <b>stock</b> when the <b>repurchase</b> premium has been high. The fraction of dividend payers that <b>repurchase</b> <b>stock</b> {{is found to be}} negatively related to the lagged dividend premium, establishing the competing attractiveness of dividends and repurchases based on the respective dividend and repurchase premium. Firms are more likely to <b>repurchase</b> <b>stock</b> when the <b>repurchase</b> premium is high and the difference between the repurchase and dividend premium is positive. The second essay looks at a relatively new way of buying back shares, called Accelerated Share Repurchases (ASRs). ASRs are credible commitments by firms to repurchase shares immediately. Including an ASR in a repurchase program reduces the flexibility that firms have to alter an announced program in response to subsequent changes in the price and liquidity of its stock, unexpected shocks to cash flow and/or investment, etc. We investigate whether firms' decisions to include ASRs in their repurchase programs are associated with factors expected to influence the costs of lost flexibility and the benefits of enhanced credibility and immediacy. The third essay looks at stock market trading characteristics around ASR announcements. I find that the trading costs decrease following an ASR announcement. On average, market quality improves; trading volume increases; and trade size increases following an ASR announcement. The information asymmetry component of spread also increases post ASR...|$|R

However, the signaling hypothesis is supported only in the long-run test, not the short-run test, suggesting that market underreaction exists to the signaling initially. Of the control variables, the target purchase ratio and ownership by the largest shareholders are found significant, suggesting that the magnitude of repurchase and the ownership increase motive by the largest shareholders are also important factors that explain the <b>repurchase.</b> <b>Stock</b> <b>repurchase,</b> undervaluation, signaling, free cash flow...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{relationship}} between the extent of <b>stock</b> <b>repurchase</b> and measures of corporate governance. Design/methodology/approach – Using a sample of <b>stock</b> <b>repurchase</b> announcements by banks after the 2002 tax reform, the paper uses an event study methodology to confirm the positive market response to <b>stock</b> <b>repurchase</b> announcements. A regression analysis is then used to study the determinants of the abnormal response to the bank <b>stock</b> <b>repurchases.</b> Regression analysis is also used to analyze whether corporate governance variables are significant determinants of bank extent of <b>stock</b> <b>repurchases</b> and size. Findings – Corporate governance techniques have little impact on market response to bank stock announcements, but are related to some extent to manager decisions regarding the <b>stock</b> <b>repurchase.</b> Board structure and executive/director stock ownership do not influence the market's response to repurchases. However, in some cases board structure is positively related to management's decision regarding the extent and size of the repurchase offer. Proportion of insider equity holdings has less influence on <b>stock</b> <b>repurchase</b> characteristics. Practical implications – Board structure may have a more important role to play in the banking industry in regards to managerial decision-making than equity ownership. Equity ownership in banks tends to be driven by bank size and therefore may have less of an impact on reducing agency problems within the banking industry. Originality/value – The sample is taken after the 2002 tax reform, which provides an analysis of repurchases without tax effect implications.
