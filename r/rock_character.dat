500|$|Jenna's storyline in {{the episode}} {{received}} mixed reception. Canning enjoyed her subplot but found it predictable and stereotypical, while Sepinwall reported {{it did not}} work, and wrote that Jenna's stories need to have Liz or Jack featured prominently or that she be put with Scott Adsit's 30 <b>Rock</b> <b>character,</b> Pete Hornberger, as in this episode, [...] "as her insanity's only amusing when contrasted against a relatively normal character. As with Sepinwall, Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad believed Jenna's subplot was fair, observing it was great in parts but [...] "it just went on too long and got tedious and silly." [...] He believed {{it would be a}} good idea to have Jenna dating or perhaps marrying a recurring character, but opined [...] "The Ones" [...] did not choose that path. Tom O'Neil from the Los Angeles Times, in an August 2009 article, was thrilled for Krakowski receiving an Emmy nomination for her work on 30 Rock, but felt that [...] "The Ones" [...] would not be the episode for which she'd win the Outstanding Supporting Actress award.|$|E
500|$|The show made {{reference}} of Jack's love triangle storyline with CNBC host Avery Jessup and {{his high}} school sweetheart Nancy Donovan, played by actresses Elizabeth Banks and Julianne Moore, respectively. This plot was first introduced in the April 22, 2010, episode [...] "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter". The love triangle dilemma would continue throughout the season.

500|$|This {{episode was}} {{inspired}} by the real-life acquisition of NBC Universal by cable company Comcast in November 2009. After winning her fourth Screen Actors Guild Award as her 30 <b>Rock</b> <b>character</b> at the 16th Screen Actors Guild Awards ceremony in January 2010, Fey was asked whether or not the show would make reference to the Comcast acquisition to which she said that it would be dealt with. [...] "The sale of NBC to another company is integral to our show and it will be hard for Jack." [...] In the episode, Kabletown—a fictional Philadelphia company network—has taken over GE Sheinhardt NBC Universal, and Jack tries to contribute his ideas to the company. In April 2010, the NBC network created a website for the Kabletown company. When asked by a contributor from The Philadelphia Inquirer why the characters on 30 Rock refer to the network's new owner as [...] "Kabletown, with a K", co-showrunner and executive producer Robert Carlock revealed that the reason for this was that the staff writers came up with the name [...] "Cabletown", however, they later learned that there was a real company with a similar name, so NBC's legal team department [...] "wanted to emphasize the difference, and after a while, everyone just liked the sound of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepiwall for HitFix {{called this}} the best overall episode since season four's December 2009 episode [...] "Dealbreakers Talk Show #0001". He {{wrote that the}} episode had [...] "some incredibly funny jokes", but noted that the [...] "most hilarious moments" [...] from [...] "When It Rains, It Pours" [...] came from the main characters themselves. Sepinwall enjoyed Jack's videos to his unborn son, noting it was [...] "...the [...] I know and love best: supremely confident and... oblivious to his own insanity." [...] Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club liked that the series had moved on from making the Liz character [...] "asexual and vaguely repellent" [...] for men. In his recap, Rabin much enjoyed the episode and said [...] "If {{the rest of the}} season is as good as the first two episodes, we could have a big-time comeback on our hands." [...] Juli Weiner of Vanity Fair wrote that Paul Giamatti was a delight as his 30 <b>Rock</b> <b>character.</b> Entertainment Weekly contributor Annie Barrett was thrilled that the Tracy character was a contestant on Cash Cab, noting once the game began [...] "everything felt so right". Samantha Urban of The Dallas Morning News preferred [...] "When It Rains, It Pours" [...] to the episodes of Community and The Office, which aired on NBC the same night. Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student wrote that Giamatti played his part brilliantly, and that his involvement in the main plot was [...] "well-written, well-organized, and by far the best thing about the episode".|$|E

In an interview with Entertainment Weeklys Michael Ausiello, Banks revealed that she approached the show's staff about making an appearance on the show. [...] "I definitely put feelers out, like, 'I would love to be on your show.' And they did it. They made it happen! I'm a huge fan, so this is a dream come true." [...] She said that on her first day on set she [...] "begged" [...] producers if she could use a teleprompter—in which she is first introduced in the episode on the set of her show The Hot Box, with her interviewing Jack and another guest (Douglas Rees)—so that she could deliver her lines quickly, explaining that her fast delivery would help [...] "sell" [...] the comedy and her 30 <b>Rock</b> <b>character.</b> They agreed to it, though, a problem ensued when they could not figure the prompter out, which resulted in Banks [...] "throwing fastballs at [...] and him battling them back as fast as possible and hoping they could cut it together faster than we were doing it." [...] Banks revealed to Ausiello that she had no intention on becoming a series regular, explaining that she has been having [...] "too much fun" [...] making movies to commit to a television show full-time. According to a February 2010 report in the New York Post, after the airing of this episode, the Avery character was based on CNBC news anchor Melissa Francis, and it was Francis who [...] "pitched" [...] the character to a 30 Rock producer.
