40|$|The {{subject and}} main {{objective}} of this thesis is the legal <b>regulation</b> <b>on</b> state supervision of the insurance business and to capture its development over time. The thesis first analyses the need for state supervision of the insurance business and its main objectives. The thesis next {{provides an overview of}} the development of the legal <b>regulation</b> <b>on</b> state supervision from the foundation of the first insurance company in the territory of the Czech Republic to the current legal <b>regulation</b> <b>on</b> state supervision.

The thesis concludes by outlining that the main trend within the development of the legal <b>regulation</b> <b>on</b> state supervision of the insurance business is the strengthening of the supervision through more and more complex legal regulation. The author of the thesis leaves it open whether this current trend would lead to optimal legal <b>regulation</b> <b>on</b> state supervision as this must be tested through further developments...|$|R

5|$|The case arose when a Minnesota county taxed an Indian's {{mobile home}} {{located on the}} reservation. The Court ruled that the state {{did not have the}} {{authority}} to impose such a tax or, more generally, to regulate behavior on the reservation. Bryan has become a landmark case that has led to Indian gaming on reservations and altered the economic status of almost every Indian tribe. Later decisions, citing Bryan, ruled that Public Law 280 allows states to enact prohibitions, or crimes, that would apply on reservations, but could not impose <b>regulations</b> <b>on</b> conduct that was otherwise allowed. The case has also called into question the ability of the states to impose any sort of <b>regulations</b> <b>on</b> tribal reservations, such as labor standards and certain traffic regulations.|$|E

5|$|Nativist {{sentiment}} {{increased in}} St. Louis {{during the late}} 1840s, leading to mob attacks and riots in 1844, 1849, and 1852. The 1844 riots derived from popular outrage and resentment toward human dissection, which was then taking place at the Saint Louis University Medical College. The discovery of human remains prompted rumors of grave robbing, and a mob of more than 3,000 residents attacked the medical college, destroying most of its interior facilities. The worst nativist riot in St. Louis took place in 1854. The local militia was used to end the fighting. 10 people were killed, 33 wounded, and 93 buildings were damaged. <b>Regulations</b> <b>on</b> elections prevented fighting in future elections in 1856 and 1858.|$|E

5|$|The small American {{merchant}} {{class and}} {{officers of the}} HBC loaned settlers more credit than most could refund. Fears of creditors demanding restitution from the farmers lead to wheat receipts and scrips issued by the government declared valid currency in 1845. The law decreeing wheat as currency was ridiculed for not establishing financial standards for the merchants, who were de facto bankers. Between 1847 and 1848 the local market for wheat became flooded from overproduction, causing a decline in its value. The legislature repealed previous <b>regulations</b> <b>on</b> 20 December 1847, making only gold, silver and treasury drafts on valid currency. Thus, the creditors of the territory were able to protect their financial standing by removing wheat as tender.|$|E
5|$|Animals are {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} diseases and conditions that may affect their health. Some, like classical swine fever and scrapie are specific to one type of stock, while others, like foot-and-mouth disease affect all cloven-hoofed animals. Where the condition is serious, governments impose <b>regulations</b> <b>on</b> import and export, on the movement of stock, quarantine restrictions and the reporting of suspected cases. Vaccines are available against certain diseases, and antibiotics are widely used where appropriate. At one time, antibiotics were routinely added to certain compound foodstuffs to promote growth, but this practice is now frowned on in many countries because of the risk that it may lead to antibiotic resistance. Animals living under intensive conditions are particularly prone to internal and external parasites; increasing numbers of sea lice are affecting farmed salmon in Scotland. Reducing the parasite burdens of livestock results in increased productivity and profitability.|$|E
