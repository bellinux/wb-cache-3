It explores the degree to which two sets of European Union legal provisions for the co-ordination of national employment and fiscal policies have led to an adaptation of media discourses in selected Member States over time. Overall, the study finds only a modest degree of Europeanization with regard to media attention, representation of "foreign" voices and thematic convergence, but notes important differences between the two selected <b>governing</b> <b>modes</b> and to a lesser degree between the selected countries.

In shedding light on the emergence and first implementation of this <b>governing</b> <b>mode,</b> this paper aims at addressing two research questions.

As the field of human biotechnology is relatively new, voluntary professional self-regulation constituted the initial <b>governing</b> <b>mode.</b> In the meantime, with the exception of Ireland, all Western European countries have moved towards greater state intervention. Nevertheless they have done so in contrasting ways and the resulting governance modes for assisted reproductive technology (ART) and embryonic stem-cell research vary greatly. Instead of imposing their steering capacity in a ‘top-down’ fashion, governments have taken pre-existing self-regulatory arrangements in the field into account and built up governance mechanisms in conjunction with private actors and pre-existing modes of private governance. Our analysis demonstrates that the form and content of the initial self-regulation explain why the self-steering capacity of the medical profession was largely or at least partially preserved through hybrid governance systems in Britain and in Germany, while in France the self-regulation was entirely replaced by governmental intervention...|$|R

An experimental research program, focused on y-bracing, was conducted at the BHRC structural engineering laboratory. Specimens presented in this paper include three full-scale single bay frames, with symmetric y-bracing of different cross sections and connection types. In addition, one specimen with Chevron bracing was tested as a reference. A quasi-static cyclic loading was applied increasingly until yielding and failure occurred in the specimens. The results show that out-of-plane buckling is the <b>governing</b> <b>mode</b> of behavior, despite differences in the detailing of cross sections and connections. Hysteretic energy dissipation and damping of y-bracing are remarkably improved due to the flexural deformation of brace members.

The receivers were kept {{far away from the}} source to eliminate the arrival of body waves. Three different sources to nearest receiver distances (S), namely, 46 m, 56 m and 66 m, were chosen. Dispersion curves were drawn for all the sites. The maximum wavelength (lambda(max)), the maximum depth (d(max)) up to which exploration can be made and the frequency content of the signals depends on the site stiffness and the value of S. A stiffer site yields greater values of lambda(max) and d(max). For stiffer sites, an increase in S leads to an increase in lambda(max). The predominant time durations of the signals increase from stiffer to softer sites. An inverse analysis was also performed based on the stiffness matrix approach in conjunction with the maximum vertical flexibility coefficient of ground surface to establish the <b>governing</b> <b>mode</b> of excitation.
