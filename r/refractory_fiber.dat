These 24 and three existing fiber compositions were evaluated: The shrinkage and the crystalline and vitreous phases were determined vs heat treatment time and temperature. Four theoretical models were developed: Shrinkage, devitrification kinetics, density change, and fiberization. Although some of the fibers formed during Phase II had properties as good as the reference ASZ fiber, no fiber had a significantly improved performance.

40|$|In the FFTF Shutdown Program, sodium {{from the}} primary and {{secondary}} heat transport loops, Interim Decay Storage (IDS), and Fuel Storage Facility (FSF) will be transferred to four large storage tanks for temporary storage. Three of the drain tanks will be cylindrical vertical tanks having a diameter of 28 feet, height of 22 feet and fabricated from carbon steel. The vertical tanks were {{the subject of a}} previous report and are not the subject of this report. The fourth tank is a horizontal cylindrical tank 18 feet in diameter, having an overall length of 31 feet and fabricated from carbon steel. The purpose of this work is to document the thermal analyses that were performed to ensure that the FFTF horizontal sodium storage tank design is feasible from a thermal standpoint. The key criterion for this analysis is the time to heat up the storage tank containing frozen sodium at ambient temperature to 400 F. Normal operating conditions include an ambient temperature range of 32 F to 120 F. A key parameter in the evaluation of the sodium drain tank is the type of insulation.

40|$|Gas-fired {{infrared}} neaters {{have been}} in use in industrial processing {{for a number of}} years. Recent material technology advances have made significant heating efficiency improvements. This technology pertains to the infrared generators that utilize a <b>refractory</b> <b>fiber</b> matrix material originally developed for use in rocket nose cones. The matrix contains thousands of specially treated, high emissive power, alumina silica fibers, which upon heating become incandescent and release their energy outwardly, at the speed of light, in the form of infrared radiation. The heating zone is contained in the upper 1 / 16 " of the face of the matrix {{while the rest of the}} matrix acts as an insulator to prevent heat energy from being conducted backwards where it will be lost as heat available to do work. This narrow heating zone has several dramatic advantages. The generators are operating within 95 % of full output within 5 seconds, can cool down enough to touch within about 3 seconds, and can be modulated to change the heat intensity rapidly because of the low mass of fibers that are actually heated. This is an important consideration in textile web processing because burning and fires can be prevented and no time or money is wasted waiting for heaters to cool down or warm up. The conversion of gross fuel gas energy to emitted radiant energy is highly efficient because the flame front produced by the combusting fuel is maintained in the presence of thousands of fibers per square inch. This very large surface area, per unit area, provides an excellent means for the hot gas molecules to conduct their heat energy to the fiber molecules. In most cases, textile manufacturers have reported fuel savings of 40 - 60 % in their heating operations using this new technology. This paper will briefly review the three types of heat transfer, discuss the physics involved in radiation heat transfer, specifically in-This paper was presented at the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC...|$|E

The second group contains <b>refractory</b> <b>fibers,</b> chemoresistant and antifriction fibers, fibers on the basis of polyvinyl alcohol, microfiltering films, and paperlike and nonwoven materials.

40|$|<b>Refractory</b> ceramic <b>fibers</b> (RCF) {{are widely}} used to replace {{asbestos}} in applications requiring high heat resistance. Ferruginous bodies mimicking asbestos bodies (ABs) have been detected in the lungs of RCF production workers. This raises the question about their presence in other occupational groups and whether "typical ABs" still reflect past asbestos exposures in all settings. An AB counting by phase-contrast light microscopy and a screening test by analytical electron microscopy were systematically performed on all bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) submitted to our laboratory in 1992 through 1997 (n = 1, 800). When RCF were detected in electron microscopy, the structures considered as "typical ABs" were marked under light microscopy and prepared for further chemical and structural analysis. Pseudo-ABs on RCF were detected in samples from nine subjects (0. 5 %). All of them had worked either as foundry workers, steel workers, or welders. In these subjects, alumino-silicate fibers compatible with RCF accounted for 42 % of the core fibers analyzed, other nonasbestos fibers for 28 %, and asbestos fibers for 30 %.

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} {{mechanical}} performance of metakaolin-based geopolymers reinforced with refractory aluminosilicate particles and fibers, after exposure to elevated temperatures.

Specimens exposed to temperatures between 600 °C and 1000 °C exhibited reduced shrinkage with the inclusion of higher contents of particles and fibers, while retaining good mechanical strength. This behavior is attributed to the cracking control achieved in these materials, which contributes to the enhancement of their volumetric stability through the combined effect of a strong interaction between reinforcing particles and the matrix leading to crack deflection, and the potential densification of the matrix–fiber interface at increased exposure temperatures, rising the stiffness of the final composite.

We observed a strong correlation between geometric-mean length and ability to induce CL in seven samples > 6 microm in length over the time course (largest r(2) = 0. 9760). Although we also observed a close positive correlation between geometric-mean width and the ability to induce CL in eight samples < 1. 8 microm in width at 15 min (r(2) = 0. 8760), a sample of 2. 4 microm in width had a low ability to induce CL. Moreover, the relationship between width and the rate of increase in ability to induce CL had a negative correlation at 30 - 60 min (largest r(2) = 0. 7473).

Typical densities are less than 500 kilograms per cubic meters, and porosities generally exceed 0. 8. Because of their open porosity, these materials are permeable to gas glow. There are numerous instances in which internal gas transport in a thermal protection system could be important; examples include the penetration of hot boundary-layer gases into the insulation, the flow of decomposition (pyrolysis) products from the interior, the use of convective flows to mitigate ice formation caused by cryopumping, and the design of refractory vents for pressure equilibration during atmospheric entry. Computational analysis of gas flow through porous media requires values of permeability which have not previously been available for the rigid fibrous insulations used in thermal protection systems.
