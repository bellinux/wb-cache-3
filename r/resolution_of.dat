40|$|Abstract. <b>Resolutions</b> <b>of</b> cusp {{singularities}} {{are crucial}} to many techniques in computational number theory, and therefore finding explicit <b>resolutions</b> <b>of</b> these singularities {{has been the focus}} of a great deal of research. This paper presents an implementation of a sequence of algorithms leading to explicit <b>resolutions</b> <b>of</b> cusp singularities arising from totally real cubic number fields. As an example, the implementation is used to compute values of partial zeta functions associated to these cusps. 1...|$|R
