5|$|Pam asks Jim {{to talk to}} {{her father}} and {{convince}} him to work things out with her mother. But shortly after they talk, Pam learns her father has sought a separation and will be looking for his own apartment. Pam assumes it is because of something Jim said to her father, and blames him for their breakup. Pam later confronts her father about why he left her mother while Jim looks on through the window. Pam returns to the office and tells Jim her father left because Jim told him how much he loves Pam, and he realized that he had never felt that way about her mother even at their best. Pam comes to terms with the separation and tearfully embraces Jim. Later, she expresses confidence that the two are true soul mates. Andy overhears her comments about her <b>real</b> <b>life</b> <b>scenario,</b> still thinks she is talking about the film they watched and concludes that he cannot be a movie critic because he is not as insightful as Jim and Pam.|$|E

Unit Training Assemblies (UTAs) are performed jointly with PRANG’s 156th AW in a consolidated drill concept. These trainings are performed jointly with 156th AW personnel. It allows 1ABG personnel to acquire hands-on experience of what their duty will be if PRANG units are mobilize and deployed.

50|$|Assessment day {{is usually}} {{organised}} {{by the human}} resource department of the organisation. There might be other managers of the company in the assessors panel to provide technical input. Larger organisations sometimes also hire or invites their occupational psychologists on the panel to provide professional reviews on the candidate's behaviour. Occasionally, if an assessment day involves role play exercises, some companies bring professional actors to play that part to assess the behaviour of candidates. For example, {{to play a role}} of a dissatisfied client. The idea behind this is to create a <b>real</b> <b>life</b> <b>scenario.</b> Some candidates often prefer this idea and find it easier to behave in the way as they would do in real life. Ultimately, the purpose of employers having an assessment day is to measure that how well candidates will deal with a situation that they might encounter in the job.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} use chaos theory {{efficiently}} in cryptography, the chaotic maps should be implemented {{such that the}} entropy generated by the map can produce required Confusion and diffusion. Properties in chaotic systems and cryptographic primitives share unique characteristics that allow for the chaotic systems {{to be applied to}} cryptography. If chaotic parameters, as well as cryptographic keys, can be mapped symmetrically or mapped to produce acceptable and functional outputs, it will make it next to impossible for an adversary to find the outputs without any knowledge of the initial values. Since chaotic maps in a <b>real</b> <b>life</b> <b>scenario</b> require a set of numbers that are limited, they may, in fact, have no real purpose in a cryptosystem if the chaotic behavior can be predicted. One of the most important issues for any cryptographic primitive is the security of the system. However, in numerous cases, chaos-based cryptography algorithms are proved unsecure. The main issue in many of the cryptanalyzed algorithms is the inadequacy of the chaotic maps implemented in the system.|$|E

30|$|However, in our investigations, {{there is}} only a single {{experimental}} simulation in which the participants (agents) remain same throughout and the inclusion of control factors (section “Control factors”) makes the opinion formation dynamically adaptive. Moreover in real world interactions, people form new opinions while interacting with each other and share these newly formed opinions within an iteration. Thus, to incorporate this phenomenon and to link the model closer to <b>real</b> <b>life</b> <b>scenario,</b> we execute an update process on the repository itself.|$|E
