40|$|The {{implementation}} of advanced high strength steels (AHSS) into {{the automotive industry}} offers distinct advantages relative to achieving light weighting goals and improved structural performance. The challenge for the automotive industry {{is a need to}} develop the processes and know-how to implement these new materials into their product economically. Currently the primary method used to develop spot welding practices for new material involves both extensive and costly laboratory trial and error experimentation. The finite element method was used as a low cost alternative for the fundamental development of joining practices for AHSS. Specifically, the effect of electrode geometry on nugget formation in typical AHSS resistance spot weld applications was investigated. The weld joint chosen for the study was based on an Auto-Steel Partnership (A/SP) state-of-the-art B-Pillar to <b>rocker</b> <b>joint</b> using 1. 6 mm GI DP 780 to 1. 6 mm GI DP 780 (B pillar reinforcement to rocker outer reinforcement). The effect of electrode cap geometry was modeled using SORPAS ® resistance spot welding FEA software. The results were verified experimentally at the University of Waterloo Centre for Advanced Material...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For being {{convenient}} for researching the dynamic characteristic and the improvement {{and use of}} the planar six bar mechanism, for improving the dynamic technical performance, the three-dimensional solid model of the mechanism was established with ADAMS. Each part of the model in ADAMS was set up. Simulation analysis on the working process of the mechanism was achieved. The structure optimization parameters of the mechanism were obtained. The result proves that the vertical location of revolute joint of link and rocker, the location of revolute joint of crank and frame, the horizontal locations of two revolute joints of link are almost no impact on the vertical speed of slider. The vertical locations of revolute joint of frame and <b>rocker</b> and revolute <b>joint</b> of block and slider have less impact on the vertical speed and acceleration of slider. The vertical location of revolute joint of link and crank, the horizontal locations of revolute joint of frame and <b>rocker</b> and revolute <b>joint</b> of block and slider have greater impact on the maximum vertical speed and acceleration of slider...|$|R
5000|$|Her {{demands for}} a public {{investigation}} into her husband's death did not endear Zenzl Mühsam to the Nazi authorities, {{and when she was}} warned by the American journalist, Dorothy Thompson, that she was about to be arrested by the Gestapo, on 15 July 1934 she crossed the border into Czechoslovakia. [...] She was accompanied by her nephew, Joseph Elfinger, whose father had recently been sent to the Dachau concentration camp. [...] In September 1934, {{with the help of a}} book dealer called Fritz Picard and Camill Hofmann, the Czechoslovak press attaché, she managed to smuggle her dead husband's papers into Prague as [...] "diplomatic baggage". By this time she had already been able to report on the German Concentration Camps in front of international journalists, though it is not clear whether this attracted much notice. Erich Mühsam's will had also been published, appointing Rudolf <b>Rocker</b> as <b>joint</b> literary executor in collaboration with Zenzl. [...] In January 1935 she published [...] "The Ordeal of Erich Mühsam". Back in Germany the government responded by removing her German citizenship.|$|R
50|$|Rocker soles may replace regular soles on any {{style of}} footwear. Some rocker bottom shoes are purpose built {{to reduce the}} {{function}} or replace the lost function of a joint. For example, {{a person with a}} hallux rigidus (stiff big toe) may use a rocker bottom shoe to replace the flexion lost at the metatarsal <b>joint.</b> <b>Rocker</b> bottom shoes are also used to compensate for the lost range of motion, however caused, at the tibiotalar joint (ankle joint). In such cases, the wearer maintains solid and stable footing while standing, but the rock of the heel assists with the propulsive phase of gait, making walking more natural and less painful to the affected joints. Beneficiaries of this type of sole modification include people suffering from arthritis or any other disorder or injury causing pain and/or loss of motion in foot joints.|$|R
40|$|Soil-pipe {{interaction}} studies {{leading to}} the laboratory observations {{of the effects of}} differential ground movement between a heavy yielding structure and a pipeline firmly connected to it is presented in this paper. Such differential movements induce excessive stress concentrations on the pipeline. Plastics pipes fail as a consequence of such movements, though their flexibility should make them less vulnerable than rigid pipes. In order to evaluate the displacement, bending moment, shear force, vertical soil resistance at soil pipe interface under these conditions, innovative experimental techniques were developed and these are described in this paper. The soil resistance on a pipe section is characterised by the load-displacement behaviour of the embedded pipe section subjected to lateral displacement, vertical displacement, axial displacement along the axis of the pipe and rotation about the pipe axis. A mathematical analysis to complement the laboratory studies is developed and presented by treating the pipelines as a beam on elastic foundation. The magnitude and location of the maximum bending moments arising from yielding of the heavy structure is examined. The experimental observations of the behaviour of pipes subjected to such differential ground movement are compared with the results from the theoretical predictions. The provision of <b>rocker</b> pipe <b>joints</b> that entertain a permitted rotation helps to redistribute the adverse bending moments to acceptable levels and thereby alleviate distress in the pipeline. The paper gives results that demonstrate theoretically and experimentally the appropriateness of the use of flexibly jointed rocker pipes to prevent such failures. Field examples of the adoption of such joints is also presented and discussed culminating with the expression of the need for rational design procedures for pipeline foundations including rocker pipes to be incorporated into codes of practice such as EN 1295 is emphasised...|$|R
