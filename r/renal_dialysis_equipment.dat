40|$|Introduction Defibrillation of {{patients}} connected to medical equipment {{that is not}} defibrillation proof risks ineffective defibrillation and harm to the operator {{as a result of}} aberrant electrical pathways taken by the defibrillation current. Many <b>renal</b> <b>dialysis</b> systems are not currently defibrillation proof. Although national and international safety standards caution against defibrillating under this circumstance, it appears to be an area of confusion that we have investigated in more detail. Methods Thirty <b>renal</b> <b>dialysis</b> units across the UK were invited to participate in a telephone survey of current practice from 1 October 2004 to 1 October 2005. The Medical Healthcare Regulatory Agency and <b>renal</b> <b>dialysis</b> machine manufacturers were contacted for advice, and current safety standards were reviewed. Results Twenty-eight <b>renal</b> <b>dialysis</b> units completed the survey. Seven (25 %) units would not disconnect patients from <b>dialysis</b> <b>equipment</b> during defibrillation, collectively reporting 14 patients who had required defibrillation during dialysis. Eighteen (64. 3 %) units would disconnect patients from <b>dialysis</b> <b>equipment</b> during defibrillation, collectively reporting 29 patients who had required defibrillation during dialysis. No complications were identified by this survey, through the MHRA or through a literature search. Conclusion Defibrillation {{of patients}} while undergoing <b>renal</b> <b>dialysis</b> is common practice in the UK. Although no adverse events have been reported, this practice risks injury to the patient and clinical staff, and equipment damage if the <b>dialysis</b> <b>equipment</b> is not defibrillation proof. It is in breach of national and international safety standards and should not be practiced...|$|R

40|$|<b>Renal</b> <b>dialysis</b> and {{transplantation}} {{have been}} used for many years for adults with kidney failure but only recently for children. In May 1967 a renal-dialysis-transplantation program was established at The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto for patients aged 6 to 18 years living within 240 km of Toronto. In 1973, children aged 1 to 5 years began to be accepted into the program, and by August 1977, 90 children (mean age 11 years) from all parts of Canada had been admitted to the program. The creation of vascular access in very small patients is difficult; the most successful types of access have been central shunts (established above the knee or the elbow) and bovine grafts. Specially made <b>dialysis</b> <b>equipment</b> is necessary for young patients. Young children should only be accepted in a dialysis-transplantation program that has a medical staff expert in meeting the specific needs of such children...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the level of oral home-care among subjects on <b>renal</b> <b>dialysis.</b> The study included 90 subjects, 37 (41. 1 &#x 0025;) male and 53 (58. 9 &#x 0025;) female, on <b>renal</b> <b>dialysis.</b> The mean age was 45. 63 &#x 002 B;/- 16. 77. Four indices were used; the plaque index (PI); the debris index (DI); the calculus index (CI) and the gingival index (GI). Results showed that all subjects did not have optimal oral hygiene, means of PI, DI, CI and GI., were 2. 0444, 1. 9556, 1. 8944 and 1. 8167 respectively. No significant differences were observed between male and female. Frequency of plaque distribution indicated that 69. 9 &#x 0025; of the individuals had poor oral hygiene.

40|$|ABSTRACT It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that hemodiabysis patients might benefit from zinc supple-ments. However, little attention is given to the trace element content of <b>renal</b> <b>dialysis</b> fluids or to contamination of such fluids with trace metals. Pne- and postdiabysis plasma copper and zinc concentrations of patients at two hospital dialysis units were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The plasma zinc concentration increased substantially in 34 of 37 patients as a result of dialysis. Measurement of dialysate zinc concentrations after priming the dialysis apparatus with or without disposable coils demonstrated that the coils were the primary source of zinc. Because of the possibility of zinc toxicity, zinc nutritional status should be carefully evaluated before recommending zinc supplementation for dialysis patients. Unemic patients dialyzed with certain disposable Cuprophan-membrane coils receive substantial quantities ofzinc during dialysis; other Cuprophan-membranc coils tested released negligible quantities of zinc. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 33 : 1088 - 1095, 1980. There is considerable evidence indicating that patients suffering from chronic renal dis-eases and renal insufficiency often have low plasma or serum zinc concentrations, and may exhibit symptoms associated with zinc deficiency such as anorexia, taste and smell dysfunction, and impaired wound healing (8). Recent reports suggest that some patients can benefit from oral zinc supplementation, since such supplementation may be of value in treating the impaired taste acuity, anorexia, or impotence often found in dialysis patients (7, 8). Our investigation shows that patients dialyzed with certain disposable coils receive substantial quantities of zinc during dialysis and are probably not zinc deficient. In most dialysis units, little attention is given to the trace element content of <b>renal</b> <b>dialysis</b> fluids or to the possibility of contam-ination of such fluids with trace metals. Iso-lated cases of acute copper or zinc toxicity, on occasion fatal, have occurred in hemodi-alysis patients as a result of contamination of <b>dialysis</b> <b>equipment</b> or fluids with these metal...|$|R

40|$|Aim: The {{prevalence}} of {{end-stage renal disease}} (ESRD) treated with <b>renal</b> <b>dialysis</b> is poorly-known in France {{because there is no}} national registry of dialysis patients. The specific aims of this study were to determine the total number of patients treated with <b>renal</b> <b>dialysis</b> and to determine their social, demographic and clinical characteristics as well as to define the overall care they received. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional descriptive study from June 2 to June 8, 2003 in all <b>renal</b> <b>dialysis</b> units (including pediatric units) by including all the patients residing in France with ESRD who were dialyzed during that week, irrespective of their age or the treatment they received. We gathered socio-demographic (age, gender, place of residence and occupation), clinical data (the year they entered <b>dialysis,</b> initial <b>renal</b> disease, co-morbidities, associated handicaps), and information concerning their overall treatment plan (waiting list for kidney transplant, therapeutic regimen, dialysis technique used). Results: 30 882 patients residing in France were treated with <b>renal</b> <b>dialysis.</b> The unadjusted {{prevalence of}} dialysis was 513. 1 patients per million population (pmp), 498. 2 pmp in metropolitan France and 1 035. 7 pmp in the overseas territories (DOM). The clinical and socio-demographic characteristics of the patients as well as their therapeutic regimen were different in Metropolitan France and in the overseas territories. Conclusion: This study constitutes the first comprehensive inventory of dialysis in France where the prevalence of ESRD is {{among the highest in the}} world...|$|R

40|$|Background. <b>Renal</b> <b>dialysis</b> has {{recently}} been recognised as {{a risk factor for}} lower limb amputation (LLA). However, exact rates and associated risk factors for the LLA are incompletely understood. Aim. Prevalence and risk factors of LLA in end-stage renal failure (ESRF) subjects on <b>renal</b> <b>dialysis</b> were investigated from the existing literature. Methods. Published data on the subject were derived from MEDLINE, PubMed, and Google Scholar search of English language literature from January 1, 1980, to July 31, 2015, using designated key words. Results. Seventy studies were identified out of which 6 full-text published studies were included in this systematic review of which 5 included patients on haemodialysis alone and one included patients on both haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. The reported findings on prevalence of amputation in the <b>renal</b> failure on <b>dialysis</b> cohort ranged from 1. 7 % to 13. 4 %. Five out of the six studies identified diabetes as the leading risk factor for amputation in subjects with ESRF on <b>renal</b> <b>dialysis.</b> Other risk factors identified were high haemoglobin A 1 c, elevated c-reactive protein, and low serum albumin. Conclusions. This review demonstrates high rate of LLA in ESRF patients receiving dialysis therapy.
