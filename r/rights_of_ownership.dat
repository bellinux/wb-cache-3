5|$|In 1511, Melaka was conquered by Portugal, {{after which}} it {{was taken by the}} Dutch in 1641. In 1786, the British Empire {{established}} a presence in Malaya, when the Sultan of Kedah leased Penang Island to the British East India Company. The British obtained the town of Singapore in 1819, and in 1824 took control of Melaka following the Anglo-Dutch Treaty. By 1826, the British directly controlled Penang, Melaka, Singapore, and the island of Labuan, which they established as the crown colony of the Straits Settlements. By the 20th century, the states of Pahang, Selangor, Perak, and Negeri Sembilan, known together as the Federated Malay States, had British residents appointed to advise the Malay rulers, to whom the rulers were bound to defer to by treaty. The remaining five states in the peninsula, known as the Unfederated Malay States, while not directly under British rule, also accepted British advisers {{around the turn of the}} 20th century. Development on the peninsula and Borneo were generally separate until the 19th century. Under British rule the immigration of Chinese and Indians to serve as labourers was encouraged. The area that is now Sabah came under British control as North Borneo when both the Sultan of Brunei and the Sultan of Sulu transferred their respective territorial <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership,</b> between 1877 and 1878. In 1842, Sarawak was ceded by the Sultan of Brunei to James Brooke, whose successors ruled as the White Rajahs over an independent kingdom until 1946, when it became a crown colony.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} 1969 Orange Bowl, Robert Cade entered into an {{agreement}} providing Stokely-Van Camp, Inc. (S-VC), a canned-food packaging company, with the U.S. rights to production {{and sale of}} Gatorade as a commercial product. In the same year, a licensing arrangement made Gatorade the official sports drink of the National Football League (NFL), representing {{the first in a}} history of professional sports sponsorship for the Gatorade brand. A year after its commercial introduction, S-VC tested multiple variations of the original Gatorade recipe, finally settling on more palatable variants in lemon-lime and orange flavors. This reformulation also removed the sweetener cyclamate—which was banned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1969 - replacing it with additional fructose. In the early 1970s, legal questions arose regarding whether or not the researchers who invented Gatorade were entitled to ownership of its royalties, since they had been working under a research grant from the federal government which provided financial stipends. The University of Florida also claimed partial <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership,</b> which was brought to resolution in 1973 {{in the form of a}} settlement awarding the university with a 20-percent share of Gatorade royalties. As of 2009, the university had received more than $150 million from its share, and was receiving approximately $12 million per year.|$|E

This thesis draws comparisons between the relevant legal regulations of various countries and contains a selection of Czech case law together with the opinions of legal scholars and practicing professionals. The principal finding of this thesis is that from a certain point of view the passage of a new Civil Code seems to be desirable despite the current impossibility to precisely assess its impact on the <b>Right</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ownership...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{strategic}} {{value of}} Bear Island was {{recognised in the}} late 19th century, when Imperial Russia and Imperial Germany demonstrated their interests in the Barents Sea. The German journalist and adventurer Theodor Lerner visited the island in 1898 and 1899 and claimed <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership.</b> In 1899, the German fishery association Deutsche Seefischerei-Verein (DSV) started investigations of whaling and fishery in the Barents Sea. The DSV was secretly {{in contact with the}} German naval command and considered the possibility of an occupation of Bear Island. In reaction to these advances, the Russian Navy sent out the protected cruiser [...] to investigate, and the Russians hoisted their flag over Bear Island on July 21, 1899. Although Lerner protested the action, no violence occurred and the matter was settled diplomatically with no definitive claims of sovereignty over Bear Island by any nation.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1841 case of Fouldes v Willoughby , a ferryman was {{sued for}} {{conversion}} {{by the owner}} of two horses which he had put on board to be carried across a river. The ferryman subsequently refused to carry them, and when the owner declined to take them back on shore, the ferryman turned them loose on the landing place. The owner remained aboard the ferry. He {{made no attempt to}} retrieve his horses, which were subsequently lost to him. It was argued that this was an interference with the possession of the horses, and would be a trespass. [...] It was a mere asportation without any conversion or interference with <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership,</b> since the action in putting the horses ashore had recognized the right owner. [...] Consequently, the court held that trover was not an appropriate remedy. This was a signal case which brought into sharp distinction the alternate theories of trespass and trover. Trespass was the appropriate action, {{but it was not a}} conversion. This case was decided two years before the case of Johnson v Weedman (see infra) in which Abraham Lincoln successfully argued that a bailee who rode a horse for 15 miles had not incurred enough damage to invoke an action in trover. [...] This case was likely a precedent to [...] Johnson v Weedman.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my thesis is to analyse current {{legislation}} in the Czech Republic regarding {{the relation of the}} protection of the environment and the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership,</b> focusing in particular on the most recent and most controversial issues. A further part of the analysis examines whether the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> actually aids sustainable development of the environment and environmental protection. The changes which entail private recodification are highlighted for affected fields. The methodology is primarily critical analysis of current legislation, including relevant case laws and practical examples. The reason for choosing this subject of research is its topicality, the interest in the protection of environment and expectation of a dynamic development of these issues in the future. The thesis is composed of four chapters. The first two chapters form the theoretical basis required for the subsequent analysis. In relevant areas there are always parts of the interpretation which look at the new Civil Code. Chapter One defines terms such as the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership,</b> the environment and the protection of environment. The subsequent part gives a list of the relevant sources of law that govern the relationship between the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> and the environment, both international and national.

6000|$|Had he been {{required}} to make confession of his creed he would probably have framed it in some such way as this: [...] "I disbelieve in all Church dogmas, and {{do not go to}} church; I have no definite ideas about a future state, and do not want to have; but in a private way I try to identify myself as much as possible with what I see about me, feeling that if I could ever really be at one with the world I live in I should be happy. I think it foolish not to trust my senses and my reason; as for what my senses and my reason will not tell me, I assume that all is as it had to be, for if one could get to know the why of everything in one would be the Universe. I do not believe that chastity is a virtue in itself, but only so far as it ministers to the health and happiness of the community. I do not believe that marriage confers the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership,</b> and I loathe all public wrangling on such matters; but I am temperamentally averse to the harming of my neighbours, if in reason it can be avoided. As to manners, I think that to repeat a bit of scandal, and circulate backbiting stories, are worse offences than the actions that gave rise to them. If I mentally condemn a person, I feel guilty of moral lapse. I hate self-assertion; I am ashamed of self-advertisement. I dislike loudness of any kind. Probably I have too much tendency to negation of all sorts. Small-talk bores me to extinction, but I will discuss a point of ethics or psychology half the night. To make capital out of a person's weakness is repugnant to me. I want to be a decent man, but--I really can't take myself too seriously." ...|$|E
6000|$|My {{grandmother}} and uncle were already {{seated in the}} canopied pew when we pedestrians entered the church. Mary Warren turned into another aisle, and proceeded to the pew reserved for the rector, accompanied by my sister, while the other two ladies passed up to the chancel, and took their customary places. I followed, {{and for the first}} time in my life was seated beneath the offensive canopy, vested with all the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership.</b> By the term [...] "canopy," [...] however, the reader is not to imagine anything like festooned drapery--crimson colors and gilded laces; our ambition had never soared so high. The amount of the distinction between this pew and any other in the church was simply this: it was larger and more convenient than those around it, an advantage which any other might have equally enjoyed who saw fit to pay for it, as had been the case with us, and it was canopied with a heavy, clumsy, ill-shaped sort of a roof, that was a perfect caricature of the celebrated baldachino of St. Peter's in Rome. The first of these advantages probably excited no particular envy, for it came within the common rule of the country, of [...] "play and pay;" [...] but as for the canopy, that was aristocratic, and was not to be tolerated. Like the leasehold tenure, it was opposed to the [...] "spirit of the institutions." [...] It is true, it did no real harm, as an existing thing; it is true, it had a certain use, as a memorial of past opinions and customs; it is true, it was property, and could not be touched without interfering with its privileges; it is true, that every person who saw it secretly felt there was nothing, after all, so very inappropriate in such a pew's belonging to a Littlepage; and, most of all, it was true that they who sat in it never fancied for a moment that it made them any better or any worse than the rest of their fellow-creatures. There it was, however; and, next to the feudal character of a lease, it was the most offensive object then existing in Ravensnest. It may be questioned if the cross, which occupied the place that, according to provincial orthodoxy, a weathercock should have adorned, or Mr. Warren's surplice, was one-half as offensive.|$|E

Article 345 TFEU, formerly Article 295 EC and, before that, Article 222 EEC, is an Article that limits, but not prevents, the application of the TFEU Treaty as a whole {{to the way in which}} rules of a Member State deal with the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> undertakings. The conclusion can be drawn that Article 345 TFEU only concerns the private or public <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> undertakings, with which the Community shall not concern itself and which can thus be regulated by the Member States themselves. Most importantly, the Article does not concern the content <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership,</b> nor the objects <b>of</b> a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership.</b> It does therefore not form an obstacle to the development of a European property law. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|R
