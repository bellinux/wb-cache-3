40|$|Flagellar bending was {{analysed}} using {{photographs of}} hyperactivated hamster and mouse spermatozoa. The flagellar waveform consists of several bends; {{the centre of}} each bend was therefore located on the flagellum, and {{the angle of the}} bend measured. The direction of the bend was determined by using the asymmetry of hook-shaped head to assess the asymmetry of flagellar waveform. The bend that occurred {{in the same direction as}} the curve of head was defined as the <b>reverse</b> <b>bend</b> and the bend in the opposite direction as the principal bend. In hamster spermatozoa, flagellar bending was asymmetric to the direction of the <b>reverse</b> <b>bend</b> after incubation for 5 min. After incubation for 4 h the asymmetry had increased, as the angles of the <b>reverse</b> <b>bends</b> had increased in all regions of the flagellum but the principal bend had not. In mouse spermatozoa incubated for 5 min, flagellar bending was relatively symmetric. In the hyperactivated mouse spermatozoa incubated for 3 h, the angle of the principal bend increased in the distal region and those of the <b>reverse</b> <b>bends</b> increased in almost all regions of the flagellum. Since the increase in the <b>reverse</b> <b>bend</b> was relatively high, flagellar bending became asymmetric to the direction of the <b>reverse</b> <b>bend</b> as in hamster spermatozoa. These increases in asymmetry were also evident in the measure-ment of the total changes in angular direction between the proximal and distal end of flagella in both species. The increase in asymmetry could provide an explanation for the changes in the motility patterns seen in spermatozoa after the onset of hyperactivation.

40|$|Abstract. The U-bending {{process is}} a common sheet-metal forming process widely {{employed}} to fabricate sheet parts like channels, beams, and frames of various sizes applied in almost all industrial fields. In recent years, the precision requirements are increased on the U-bent parts. To achieve these requirements, in this study, the effects of part geometry on the spring-back/spring-go feature including work piece length, U-channel width, punch and die radii, and work piece thickness, were investigated by using the finite element method (FEM) and laboratory experiments. The FEM simulation results clearly revealed the influence of part geometry on spring-back/spring-go feature via the changes of stress distribution analyses on the bending allowance zone, the bottom of bent part, and the U-leg of bent part. Specifically, the part geometry affected on the bending characteristic on the bending allowance zone, {{as well as it}} affected on the spring-back feature. In addition, the part geometry also affected on the formation of <b>reversed</b> <b>bending</b> characteristic on the bottom and U-leg of bent parts, as well as it affected on the spring-go feature. The bending angle could be achieved by compensating these bending and <b>reversed</b> <b>bending</b> characteristics. Therefore, to meet the required bending angle, the suitable design of part geometry was strongly considered to maintain the balancing of the bending and <b>reversed</b> <b>bending</b> characteristics. The laboratory experiments were carried out to validate the accuracy of the FEM simulation results.

40|$|Asymmetrical bending waves can be {{obtained}} by reactivating demembranated sea urchin spermatozoa at high Ca " concentrations. Moving-film flash photography shows that asymmetrical flagellar bending waves are associated with premature termination of the growth of the bends in one direction (the <b>reverse</b> <b>bends)</b> while the bends in the opposite direction (the principal bends) grow for. one full beat cycle, and with unequal rates of growth of principal and <b>reverse</b> <b>bends.</b> The relative proportions of these two components of asymmetry are highly variable.

40|$|Purpose: In {{the present}} study, the {{deformation}} {{mechanics of the}} springback phenomenon in the L-bending ofsheet-metal was examined and a new method that could efficiently reduce springback in the L-bending of sheetmetalwas proposed. Design/methodology/approach: Both the finite element analysis and experiments were performed to analyzethe deformation mechanics {{and the effects of}} process parameters on the formation of springback. Findings: The axial stress distribution in the bent sheet obtained by the finite element simulations was classifiedinto three zones: the bending zone under the punch corner (zone I), unbending zone next to the bending zone(zone II), and the stress-free zone (zone III). It is found that the stress distribution in zone I is quite uniformand hence has little influence on the springback. While the stress distribution in zone II results in a positivespringback, whereas the stress distribution in zone III produces a negative springback. The total springbacktherefore depends on the combined effect of those produced by zone II and zone III. A <b>reverse</b> <b>bend</b> approachthat can efficiently reduce springback was also proposed to reduce the springback in the L-bending process. Thefinite element analysis performed {{in the present study was}} validated by experiments as well. Research limitations/implications: Although the <b>reverse</b> <b>bend</b> approach can reduce springback efficiently, itmay cause uneven surface at the die corner area. Hence, the use of <b>reverse</b> <b>bend</b> approach must be cautious ifhigh surface quality is required.

40|$|The coined-bead {{technique}} is commonly {{applied in the}} V-bending process to eliminate the spring-back feature and to achieve the required bending angle. In the present research, {{which is based on}} a stress distribution analysis, the effects of a coined-bead geometry in the V-bending process on the increased compressive stress in the bending allowance zone and on the increased <b>reversed</b> <b>bending</b> zone in the leg of the workpiece were observed and characterized. The research also illustrated the variations in spring-back and spring-go characteristics for different coined-bead widths and heights. As the bead width increased, the spring-go decreased, increased, and decreased again for different simulated bead heights and workpiece materials. The research was able to disprove previously suggested theories for coined-beaded V-bending, which suggested that a smaller bead width should be applied to cancel out the spring-back characteristic. In addition, the spring-back characteristic returned when an oversized bead width was applied. Therefore, to achieve the required bending angle, the size of the bead width was optimized both to provide a balance between a favorable stress distribution in the bending zone and <b>reversed</b> <b>bending</b> zone and to reduce the bending load...|$|E

The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the effect of {{successive}} TIG (tungsten inert gas) welding repairs on the <b>reverse</b> <b>bending</b> fatigue strength of AISI 4130 steel, which is widely used in components critical to the flight-safety.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{principle}} possibility of stripping extraction {{in combination with}} <b>reverse</b> <b>bends</b> in isochronous separate sector cyclotrons (and/or FFAGs). If one uses <b>reverse</b> <b>bends</b> between the sectors (instead of drifts) and places stripper foils at the sector exit edges, the stripped beam has a reduced bending radius {{and it should be}} able to leave the cyclotron within the range of the <b>reverse</b> <b>bend</b> - even if the beam is stripped at less than full energy. We are especially interested in $H_ 2 ^+$-cyclotrons, which allow to double the charge to mass ratio by stripping. However the principle could be applied to other ions or ionized molecules as well. For the production of proton beams by stripping extraction of an $H_ 2 ^+$-beam, we discuss possible designs for three types of machines: First a low-energy cyclotron for the simultaneous production of several beams at multiple energies - for instance 15 MeV, 30 MeV and 70 MeV - thus allowing to have beam on several isotope production targets. In this case it is desired to have a strong energy dependence of the direction of the extracted beam thus allowing to run multiple target stations simultaneously. Second we consider a fast variable energy proton machine for cancer therapy that should allow extraction (of the complete beam) at all energies in the range of about 70 MeV to about 250 MeV into the same beam line. And third, we consider a high intensity high energy machine, where the main design goals are extraction with low losses, low activation of components and high reliability. The price that has to be paid for these advantages is an increase in size and/or in field strength compared to proton machines with standard extraction at the final energy.
