5|$|Jane sits at {{her kitchen}} table with a pistol when a figure leaps through her window and hacks off one of her arms. The wound sprays blood over the kitchen walls before Jane falls to the floor. The killer {{continues}} to hack at her until she is dead, at which point Neal is revealed to be the murderer. Upon learning the details of Berti's sadistic murder spree, Neal recovered a previously <b>repressed</b> memory involving his murder of a girl who had sexually humiliated {{him when he was}} a youth in Rhode Island. The memory torments Neal and inflames his previously <b>repressed</b> lust for blood, driving him insane.|$|E
5|$|The German {{occupation}} administration <b>repressed</b> {{political dissent}} and launched numerous unpopular measures, including the deportation of Belgian workers to Germany and forced labour on military projects. It also supported the radical Flemish Movement by making numerous concessions {{as part of}} the Flamenpolitik in an attempt to gain support among the country's Flemish population. As a result, numerous resistance movements were founded which attempted to sabotage military infrastructure, collect intelligence for the Allies or print underground newspapers. Low-level expressions of dissent were common although frequently <b>repressed.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1959, Luba-Lulua {{animosity}} {{was brought}} to a head by {{the discovery of a}} colonial proposal to move Luba farmers out of Lulua land to the less fertile land on Luba territory.

40|$|The alpha 2 protein of {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{normally}} <b>represses</b> {{a set of}} cell-type-specific genes (the a-specific genes) that are transcribed by RNA polymerase II. In this study, we determined whether alpha 2 can affect transcription by other RNA polymerases. We find that alpha 2 can <b>repress</b> transcription by RNA polymerase I but not by RNA polymerase III. Additional experiments indicate that alpha 2 <b>represses</b> RNA polymerase I transcription through the same pathway that it uses to <b>repress</b> RNA polymerase II transcription. These results implicate conserved components of the transcription machinery as mediators of alpha 2 repression and exclude several alternate models...|$|R

5|$|Mavis {{was portrayed}} as moralising, <b>repressed,</b> and dithering, and often {{appeared}} in comic scenes with her boss Rita Sullivan or her husband Derek Wilton. She was generally well received by critics, {{described as a}} national institution and one of Coronation Street's best loved characters, an old-fashioned spinster. Barlow has been praised for her portrayal of Mavis, a character notably spoofed by impressionist Les Dennis during the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The innate {{sexuality}} of bloodsucking {{can be seen}} in its intrinsic {{connection with}} cannibalism and folkloric one with incubus-like behaviour. Many legends report various beings draining other fluids from victims, an unconscious association with semen being obvious. Finally Jones notes that when more normal aspects of sexuality are <b>repressed,</b> regressed forms may be expressed, in particular sadism; he felt that oral sadism is integral in vampiric behaviour.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the late}} 1950s, the Afro-Dominican culture {{of most of}} the island was <b>repressed</b> by the colonial {{government}} and the influence of the Roman Catholic Church, both of which taught that African-derived music was evil, demonic and uncultured.

5|$|Anarchism as {{a social}} {{movement}} in Cuba held great influence with the working classes during the 19th and early 20th century. The movement was particularly strong following {{the abolition of slavery}} in 1886, until it was <b>repressed</b> first in 1925 by President Gerardo Machado, and finally by Fidel Castro's Marxist–Leninist government following the Cuban Revolution in the late 1950s. Cuban anarchism mainly took the form of anarcho-collectivism based on the works of Mikhail Bakunin and, later, anarcho-syndicalism. The Latin American labor and by extension the Cuban labor movement itself was at first more influenced by anarchism than Marxism.|$|E

5|$|Expression of Hsp90A also {{correlates}} with disease prognosis. Increased levels of Hsp90A {{are found in}} leukemia, breast and pancreatic cancers {{as well as in}} patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In human T-cells, HSP90AA1 expression is increased by the cytokines IL-2, IL-4 and IL-13. HSP90, alongside other conserved chaperones and co-chaperones that interact to safeguard proteostasis, is <b>repressed</b> in aging human brains. This repression was found to be further exacerbated in the brains of patients with age-onset neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Huntington's disease.|$|E
