50|$|The work {{included}} dredging and reconfiguration {{of most of}} the channels, a new lock at Bow, {{rebuilding of}} Marshgate Lock on a new site further to the east, and {{the construction of a new}} lock at Carpenter's Road, at the northern end of the City Mills River. The whole project took around four years to complete, with work starting in 1931. Work on the lock itself, which was 92 ft long and 20 ft wide, began in 1933, and it was completed in 1934. It was built with rising <b>radial</b> <b>gates</b> at both ends. The use of rising <b>radial</b> <b>gates</b> was fairly common in continental Europe, but Carpenter's Road was the first use of them in Britain. The choice was dictated by the fact that the structure had to act both as a navigation lock and as a means of discharging flood water. It also had to be able to cope with variable water levels in both the City Mills River to the south, and the tidal Waterworks River to the north, where either one could be higher than the other. It was therefore built with two rising <b>radial</b> <b>gates,</b> one at each end.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: As the key {{components}} of large-scale hydraulic <b>radial</b> <b>gate,</b> hinge system {{play an important role}} in supporting the gate and sustaining loads. They must satisfy the requirements of intensity, rigidity and supporting stability. Due to the complicated working conditions of the gate, it is difficult to calculate stress and strain of the hinge system based on traditional design method. In this paper, taking the <b>radial</b> <b>gate</b> in Silin hydropower station as an example, finite element technology is introduced into the analysis of the hinge system. The approach of this work includes steps of (1) obtaining the maximum load of the hinge system by analyzing and comparing different working conditions of the gate, (2) modeling the hinge system by meshing, loading and boundary constraints, and (3) computing stress and strain of its major components under the most dangerous condition. The results verify design feasibility and structural reliability of the hinge system...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of an enhanced approach {{for the use of}} radial gates as flow measurement structures is important in irrigation networks. In this study, new theoretical relationships were developed to estimate the discharge coefficient (Cd) for a single <b>radial</b> <b>gate</b> with three different sills, at free and submerged flow conditions. These equations were calibrated and verified by using about 2600 laboratory data from the world-wide literature. Results indicated that the flow rate under the radial gates can be estimated by an error in the order of ± 5 %. The reliability of the proposed relationships and in particular the scale effects, were tested using 530 field data of radial gates operating on different canal networks. The predictions of the flow rates from the proposed method are shown to be superior compare with the other predictive methods. In the presence of multi radial gates in a given cross section, the total discharge is estimated by an error up to ± 30 % when using single <b>radial</b> <b>gate</b> relationships. This discrepancy is considered to be mainly due to the influence of different gate openingsand the difference between gate and canal widths. A self-developed correction factor, k, was introduced to account for the dimensionless effective parameters such as the ratio of gate-to-canal width, the geometry of the gates, and the ratios of upstream and downstream depths to the average gates openings. The results are promising the predictive errors of the total flow rates are reduced by ± 5 % and ± 10 % for 74 % and 94 % of the flow data, respectively...|$|E
