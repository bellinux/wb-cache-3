50|$|Patent {{prosecution}} {{describes the}} interaction between applicants and their representatives, and <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> office with regard to <b>a</b> <b>patent,</b> or <b>an</b> application for <b>a</b> <b>patent.</b> Broadly, patent prosecution can be split into pre-grant prosecution, which involves negotiation with <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> office for the grant of <b>a</b> <b>patent,</b> and post-grant prosecution, which involves issues such as post-grant amendment and opposition.|$|R
5000|$|The {{process of}} [...] "negotiating" [...] or [...] "arguing" [...] with <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> {{office for the}} grant of <b>a</b> <b>patent,</b> and {{interaction}} with <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> office with regard to <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> after its grant, is known as patent prosecution. Patent prosecution is distinct from patent litigation which relates to legal proceedings for infringement of <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> after it is granted.|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> {{is to protect}} inventions. Patents provide the owner of <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> with the {{exclusive}} right to make, use and sell <b>a</b> <b>patented</b> invention.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> {{standard}} <b>patent</b> {{application is}} <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> application containing {{all of the}} necessary parts (e.g. a written {{description of the invention}} and claims) that are required for the grant of <b>a</b> <b>patent.</b> <b>A</b> standard <b>patent</b> may or may not result in the grant of <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> depending upon the outcome of an examination by the patent office it is filed in. In the U.S., <b>a</b> standard <b>patent</b> application is referred to as a [...] "non-provisional" [...] application.|$|R

50|$|To {{obtain the}} grant of <b>a</b> <b>patent,</b> <b>a</b> person, either legal or natural, must file an {{application}} at <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> office with the jurisdiction to grant <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> in the geographic area over which coverage is required. This is often <b>a</b> national <b>patent</b> office, but may be a regional body, such as the European Patent Office. Once the patent specification complies with {{the laws of the}} office concerned, <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> may be granted for the invention described and claimed by the specification.|$|R
40|$|We {{argue that}} <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> system makes {{collusion}} among innovators more difficult. Our simple argument {{is based on}} two properties of the <b>patent</b> system. First, <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> not only protects against infringement but also against retaliation by former collusion members. Second, a deviator has an equal chance with former collusion members to get <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> on new innovations. We show that if <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> system reduces spillovers, it renders collusion impossible. Moreover, {{it is possible to}} design <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> system that simultaneously increases knowledge spillovers and eliminates collusionPatens, Collusion, Secrecy, Innovation...|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>patent</b> {{application}} is <b>a</b> request pending at <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> {{office for the}} grant of <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> for the invention described and claimed by that application. An application consists of {{a description of the}} invention (the patent specification), together with official forms and correspondence relating to the application. The term patent {{application is}} also used to refer to the process of applying for <b>a</b> <b>patent,</b> or to the patent specification itself (i.e. the content of the document filed with a view to initiating the process of applying for <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> [...] ).|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} obtaining the grant of <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> {{begins with the}} {{preparation}} of a specification describing the invention. That specification is filed at <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> office for examination and ultimately <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> for the invention described in the application is either granted or refused.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> {{chemical}} <b>patent,</b> {{pharmaceutical patent}} or drug <b>patent</b> is <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> for <b>an</b> invention in the chemical or pharmaceuticals industry. Strictly speaking, in most jurisdictions, there are essentially {{no differences between}} the legal requirements to obtain <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> for <b>an</b> invention in the chemical or pharmaceutical fields, in comparison to obtaining <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> in the other fields, {{such as in the}} mechanical field. <b>A</b> chemical <b>patent</b> or <b>a</b> pharmaceutical <b>patent</b> is therefore not a sui generis right, i.e. a special legal type of patent.|$|R
50|$|The {{review process}} {{in no way}} abrogates the {{responsibility}} of the patent examiner to assess <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> application. Prior art submitted by Peer-to-Patent Australia is solely designed to assist <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> examiner. The patent examiner remains the arbiter of whether <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> is to be granted.|$|R
50|$|This {{part of the}} act {{primarily}} {{deals with}} what patent and inventions are, the requirements needed for the grant of <b>a</b> <b>patent,</b> the procedure for applying for <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> and also gives the rights conferred by the patent {{as well as what}} will invalidate <b>a</b> <b>patent.</b>|$|R

5000|$|During the 1990s, {{federal courts}} began {{reversing}} earlier {{decisions made by}} the patent office that restricted the patenting of software. In 1997, software companies Trend Micro, Integralis, McAffee and Symantec fought <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> war over antivirus software. In 1999, <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> for [...] "one-click ordering technology" [...] led to <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> war between Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble. In 2004, Sony and Kodak engaged in <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> war over digital cameras, a dispute which lasted until 2007.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "{{validity}} search" [...] is a {{prior art}} search done after <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> issues. The {{purpose of a}} validity (or invalidity) search is to find prior art that the patent examiner overlooked so that <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> can be declared invalid. This might be done by an entity infringing, or potentially infringing, the patent, {{or it might be}} done by <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> owner or other entity that has a financial stake in <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> to confirm the validity of <b>a</b> <b>patent.</b> Crowdsourcing, where <b>a</b> large number of interested people search for prior art, may be effective where references would otherwise be difficult to find.|$|R

50|$|Under United States <b>patent</b> law, <b>a</b> {{continuing}} <b>patent</b> {{application is}} <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> application that follows, and claims priority to, <b>an</b> earlier-filed <b>patent</b> application.|$|R
5000|$|Once <b>an</b> {{invention}} is <b>patented</b> in Canada, {{exclusive rights}} are {{granted to the}} patent holder as defined by s.42 of the Patent Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. P-4). Any interference with the patent holder's [...] "full enjoyment of the monopoly granted by the patent" [...] is considered <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> infringement. Making, constructing, using, or selling <b>a</b> <b>patented</b> invention without the patent holder's permission can constitute infringement. Possession of <b>a</b> <b>patented</b> object, use of <b>a</b> <b>patented</b> object in <b>a</b> process, and inducement or procurement of an infringement may also, in some cases, count as infringement.|$|R

50|$|Examination is {{the process}} by which <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> office determines whether <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> {{application}} meets the requirements for granting <b>a</b> <b>patent.</b> The process involves considering whether the invention is novel and inventive, whether the invention is in an excluded area and whether the application complies with the various formalities of the relevant patent law.|$|R
50|$|In 1979, Hefton and {{collaborator}} Magdalena G. Eisinger filed <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> for {{the process}} of growing human epidermal cells in tissue culture.

5000|$|Depending {{upon the}} office at which <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> {{application}} is filed, that application could either be an application for <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> in <b>a</b> given country, or may be an application for <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> in <b>a</b> range of countries. The former are known as [...] "national (patent) applications", and the latter as [...] "regional (patent) applications".|$|R
50|$|Judging {{patentability}} is {{one aspect}} of the official examination of <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> application performed by <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> examiner and may be tested in post-grant patent litigation.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>patent</b> {{examiner}} (or, historically, <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> clerk) is <b>an</b> employee, {{usually a}} civil servant with a scientific or engineering background, working at <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> office.

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>patent</b> {{portfolio}} is <b>a</b> collection of <b>patents</b> owned by <b>a</b> single entity, {{such as an}} individual or corporation. The patents may be related or unrelated. Patent applications may also be regarded as included in <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> portfolio.|$|R
50|$|In United States patent law, <b>patent</b> misuse is <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> holder's use of <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> to {{restrain}} trade beyond enforcing the exclusive rights that <b>a</b> lawfully obtained <b>patent</b> provides. If <b>a</b> court finds that <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> holder committed patent misuse, the court may rule that the patent holder {{has lost the}} right to enforce the patent. Patent misuse that restrains economic competition substantially can also violate United States antitrust law.|$|R
50|$|According to the Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices, the U.S. Copyright Office may {{register}} {{a claim to}} copyright in <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> or <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> application, provided that the work contains a sufficient amount of original authorship. (The copyrighted work might consist of the written description for an invention or the drawings or photographs contained in the patent.) Likewise, the Office may {{register a}} claim to copyright in articles, publications, or other non-patent literature that may be submitted with <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> application. However, as with any other copyrighted work, the copyright in <b>a</b> <b>patent,</b> <b>a</b> <b>patent</b> application, or non-patent literature does not extend to any “idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery” that may be disclosed in these works. 17 U.S.C. § 102(b).|$|R
