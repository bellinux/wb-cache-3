2500|$|Because of {{the weather}} and the poverty of the soil, the plateau is mostly heath and bare dirt with only a few common juniper shrubs and some moor birches. The {{principal}} vascular plants one encounters are snowbed willow, Alpine bearberry, Alpine hawkweed, crowberry, cowberry, blue whortleberry and alpine azalea. But that which renders the vegetation of the Fulufjället plateau particularly unique in Sweden is its richness in lichens, with in particular the vast carpets of <b>reindeer</b> <b>lichen</b> and of fönsterlav, not affected there by the pasture of domestic reindeer, unlike most of the Swedish mountains.

60|$|In {{the morning}} I {{started for the}} saltpetre-works, a {{distance}} of fourteen leagues. Having ascended the steep coast-mountains by a zigzag sandy track, we soon came {{in view of the}} mines of Guantajaya and St. Rosa. These two small villages are placed at the very mouths of the mines; and being perched up on hills, they had a still more unnatural and desolate appearance than the town of Iquique. We did not reach the saltpetre works till after sunset, having ridden all day across an undulating country, a complete and utter desert. The road was strewed with the bones and dried skins of many beasts of burden which had perished on it from fatigue. Excepting the Vultur aura, which preys on the carcasses, I saw neither bird, quadruped, reptile, nor insect. On the coast-mountains, at the height of about 2000 feet, where during this season the clouds generally hang, a very few cacti were growing in the clefts of rock; and the loose sand was strewed over with a lichen, which lies on the surface quite unattached. This plant belongs to the genus Cladonia, and somewhat resembles the <b>reindeer</b> <b>lichen.</b> In some parts it was in sufficient quantity to tinge the sand, as seen from a distance, of a pale yellowish colour. Farther inland, during the whole ride of fourteen leagues, I saw only one other vegetable production, and that was a most minute yellow lichen, growing on the bones of the dead mules. This was the first true desert which I had seen: the effect on me was not impressive; but I believe this was owing to my having become gradually accustomed to such scenes, as I rode northward from Valparaiso, through Coquimbo, to Copiapó. The appearance of the country was remarkable, from being covered by a thick crust of common salt, and of a stratified saliferous alluvium, which seems to have been deposited as the land slowly rose above the level of the sea. The salt is white, very hard, and compact: it occurs in water-worn nodules projecting from the agglutinated sand, and is associated with much gypsum. The appearance of this superficial mass very closely resembled that of a country after snow, before the last dirty patches are thawed. The existence of this crust of a soluble substance over the whole face of the country shows how extraordinarily dry the climate must have been for a long period.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Species composition, detritus, {{and soil}} data from 97 boreal forest stands along a {{transect}} in central Canada were analysed using Correspondence Analysis {{to determine the}} dominant environmental/site variables that differentiate these forest stands. Picea mariana stands were densely clustered together on the understorey DCA plot, suggesting a consistent understorey species composition (feather mosses and Erica-ceae), whereas Populus tremuloides stands had the most di-verse understorey species composition (ca. 30 species, mostly shrubs and herbs). Pinus banksiana stands had several charac-teristic species of <b>reindeer</b> <b>lichens</b> (Cladina spp.), but saplings and Pinus seedlings were rare. Although climatic variables showed large variation along the transect, the CCA results indicated that site conditions are more important in determining species composition and differentiating the stand types.

40|$|The {{lichen flora}} of the Nordic countries, {{containing}} about 2, 000 species, {{is regarded as}} one of the best known in the world. Lichenological research of the region has been continuous since the time of Erik Acharius (1757 - 1819), the 'father of lichenology', but there is no modern treatment of the region's impressive lichen flora. The last attempt was made in the 1870 s by Th. M. Fries, but his major work, "Lichenographia Scandinavica", unfortunately remained unfinished. A number of specialist lichenologists have united forces to produce this much needed "Nordic Lichen Flora". This, the fourt volume dedicated to the family Parmeliaceae, includes 152 species, the editors, together with 11 colleagues, treating the 41 genera as separate chapters. The corticolous lichens of the Parmeliaceae are often dominant in the landscape of northern boreal forests, as are members of the terricolous Cladoniaceae, the <b>reindeer</b> <b>lichens,</b> the family to be treated in the next volume of the "Nordic Lichen Flora"...|$|R
50|$|Many lichens {{are very}} {{sensitive}} to environmental disturbances and can be used in cheaply assessing air pollution, ozone depletion, and metal contamination. Lichens have been used in making dyes, perfumes, and in traditional medicines. A few lichen species are eaten by insects or larger animals, such as <b>reindeer.</b> <b>Lichens</b> are widely used as environmental indicators or bio-indicators. If air is very badly polluted with sulphur dioxide there may be no lichens present, just green algae may be found. If the air is clean, shrubby, hairy and leafy lichens become abundant. A few lichen species can tolerate quite high levels of pollution and are commonly found on pavements, walls and tree bark in urban areas. The most sensitive lichens are shrubby and leafy while the most tolerant lichens are all crusty in appearance. Since industrialisation many of the shrubby and leafy lichens such as Ramalina, Usnea and Lobaria species have very limited ranges, often being confined to the parts with the purest air.|$|R

30|$|The {{majority}} of studies documenting {{the relationship between}} lichens and disturbance regimes suggest that lichens are highly impacted by burning, {{both in terms of}} diversity and abundance, across a range of habitats (Klein 1982, Antos et al. 1983, Mistry 1998, Reinhart and Menges 2004, Johansson and Reich 2005). Reduced lichen cover may persist in burned areas due to slow growth and colonization rates, and as the result of unprotected organelles in ground-layer lichens (Antos et al. 1983, Holt and Severns 2005). Nonetheless, a study of <b>reindeer</b> <b>lichens</b> (Cladonia spp. P. Browne) in grasslands of Minnesota, USA, suggests that recovery is largely a factor of fire intensity and frequency, whereby lichens subjected to low intensity fires are quicker to recover compared to those exposed to higher intensity burns (Johansson and Reich 2005). Many of the studies detailing lichen community response to fire in North America have focused on soil lichens within grassland habitats of the West (Bowker et al. 2004, Holt and Severns 2005, Johansson and Reich 2005), and therefore provide limited insight to the response of corticolous lichen communities in forest and woodland settings.|$|R
40|$|In the 1970 s, mean lichen biomass ranged by the earmark districts (comprising of 2 - 9 {{adjacent}} herding associations) between 54 kg and 380 kg DM per ha correlating negatively {{with animal}} density per lichen ranges (range 1. 5 - 14. 3 ind. per km 2). Biomasses were far below economic carrying capacity of lichen ranges (900 kg DM per ha).

The increase in production has been some higher than expected on the basis of animal numbers. The reasons for the increasing trends in animal numbers, recruitment and production remains some unclear, but they may include favorable winter conditions, supplementary feeding, medical treatment against parasites and proper harvesting policy...|$|R

40|$|Question How does pioneer {{vegetation}} of acid inland dunes {{respond to}} addition of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) ? Location Two inland dune reserves in The Netherlands with {{low and high}} N deposition. Methods During 2. 5 yr, N and P addition (control, N, P, NP) took place in three different vegetation types of inland dunes (Polytrichum piliferum mats, Campylopus introflexus mats and lichen-dominated vegetation). In each site, changes in the vegetation were recorded in three replicate quadrats of 1 m × 1 m per treatment. Differences in element content of grasses and lichens were recorded, together with vegetation parameters, including cover and height of grasses, bryophytes and lichens. Results In the site with high N deposition, grasses were taller, had higher N:P ratios and a generally lower lichen cover than in the low-deposition area. Experimental N application resulted in higher N and lower base metal concentrations in grasses {{and an increase in}} grass cover and size. In contrast, lichens showed a general decline in the N treatment and the lichen:grass ratio decreased. The effect of N addition was larger in the low-deposition area. The P treatment had an opposite effect: lichens increased in size and cover and overgrew grasses, especially when <b>reindeer</b> <b>lichens</b> were present. This suggests that the cryptogam layer was P-limited even in the low N deposition site. Conclusions Pioneer vegetation in inland dunes is susceptible to N and P addition.
