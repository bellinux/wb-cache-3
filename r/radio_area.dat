50|$|Most {{buildings}} in Kebayoran Baru were designed following {{the principle of}} functionalism, that is making use of the latest building material (reinforced concrete) and taking into consideration the principle of tropical design - to maximize natural lighting while minimizing the heat {{without the use of}} electricity. Post-war modernism style e.g. the so-called Yankee-type or Jengki style were popular in Kebayoran Baru, so called because of its heavy influence from the American post-war modernism. For example, middle class houses in Kebayoran were designed with square or rectangular layout, but the first floor is tilted forward to protect the facade of the lower level from the sun. Lower-level official houses in Kebayoran make use of front patio. Larger villas in Kebayoran were usually designed by well-known Indies architects at that time such as Job & Sprey and Liem Bwan Tjie.

30|$|Two {{original}} {{contributions are}} presented in this work. First, a real VoLTE traffic framework is created {{that is based on}} IMS/MMTel which has been accepted as a unified solution at the GSMA mobile world congress 2010, followed by moving a call to a UTRAN <b>radio</b> <b>area.</b> VoLTE gives the ability to conduct voice and data simultaneously, {{which is one of the}} key strengths of this technology. For this reason, this research considered a heterogeneous network of 4 G LTE and 3 G UMTS. An extensive simulation using the OPNET Modeler Wireless Suite was created to simulate both 4 G LTE network and 3 G UMTS (including many scenarios). The coexistence scenarios of LTE and UMTS technologies were considered to provide voice call continuity. Details of the simulation network are explained in Section 5. In order to give a realistic scenario, three different RT and non-RT traffic flows were generated with different QoS requirements and characteristics; VoLTE is delay-sensitive, video conferencing is bandwidth-sensitive, and FTP is loss-sensitive.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method for}} {{improving}} the playback quality of one segment terrestrial television broadcasting (called 1 seg, hereafter) at mobile terminals staying in a weak 1 seg radio reception area (called WRA terminals) by wireless multi-hop video streaming from terminals in strong 1 seg <b>radio</b> <b>area</b> (called SRA terminals). First, we formulate the problem to derive the set of video forwarding paths that maximize the number of WRA terminals to be “relieved ” by receiving the forwarded video, under the constraints on the wireless bandwidth and {{the maximum number of}} hops. Since this problem is NP-hard and deriving the optimal solution in real-time is infeasible, we propose a greedy algorithm that each WRA terminal find a video forwarding path from a SRA terminal receiving the required 1 seg channel based on the information periodically exchanged among neighboring terminals. In order {{to increase the number of}} relieved terminals, we introduce a technique to let a SRA terminal change its watching 1 seg channel, forward the video to a WRA terminal, and ask for the relief for itself. Through computer simulations, we confirme that the proposed algorithm with 2 -hop relief paths improved the video playback quality in more than 60 % of the total WRA staying time. I...|$|E
