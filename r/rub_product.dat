40|$|Even though alcohol-based hand {{disinfectants}} {{have been}} used for decades as a routine measure in Europe, in the USA until recently handwashing was the procedure of choice. Alcohol-based <b>rub</b> <b>products</b> were recommended only if no handwashing facility or running water was available. It was only during the late 80 s and early 90 s that the advantages of alcohol-based products began to elicit interest. In 1995 Larsen published new application guidelines for hand disinfection and in 1996 the CDC included alcohol-based hand disinfection in its “Isolation guideline”. However, these recommendations were rarely implemented in practice. In 1996 Didier Pittet first gave me a demonstration of alcohol-based <b>rub</b> <b>products</b> at his Geneva hospital, and the following year experts at Lausanne University provided me with the products available at that time. In 1998 and 2000 I had the opportunity to exchange information and experiences with numerous European experts, including Dr. Molitor, who also gave me additional insights into the mechanism of action of such products. As a result of myriad scientific demonstrations, interest in these <b>rub</b> <b>products</b> now began to be expressed in the USA too. In 1999 an interdisciplinary working group for hand hygiene was set up, comprising representatives from CDC’s Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC), the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, whose intention was to formulate new guidelines for hand hygiene in the healthcare sector. The insights that I gained from Dr. Molitor and from other European experts were of enormous value and helped to weigh up {{the pros and cons of}} alcohol-based hand disinfection, both in respect of the different products available and on comparing them with hand washing. The new CDC guideline for hand hygiene was published in 20002 and for the first time in the USA it featured the requirement that alcohol-based <b>rub</b> <b>products</b> be used as the method of choice provided that the hands were not visibly soiled or contaminated with protein-based material. Unfortunately, we have no reliable data, but it is estimated that today up to 95 % of doctors and nurses in American hospitals preferentially use alcohol-based <b>rub</b> <b>products</b> – thus reflecting a situation that has long been common practice in Europe...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Hand hygiene (HH) is a {{critical}} component for controlling hospital-acquired infection (HAI). The present {{study was designed to}} develop an intervention approach to improve compliance with HH among healthcare workers in a hospital setting. Methods: The HH intervention study was conducted in Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital, Guiyang, China and organized by its Department of HAI Management. It was an observational, prospective, quasiexperimental (before-after intervention) study. The study was divided into two phases: the baseline phase and the intervention phase. The investigative team included clinical monitoring staff and infection control practitioners who received a series of instructions on HH compliance, monitoring skills, and measurement of the use of HH products. Results: Based on 27, 852 observations in a 17 -month period, the rate of compliance with HH improved from 37. 78 % at baseline to 75. 90 % after intervention. Significant improvement in compliance and an increase in consumption of HH products was observed after intervention. The per patient-day consumption of alcohol-based hand <b>rub</b> <b>products</b> and handwash agents increased by 4. 75  mL and 4. 55  mL, respectively. The consumption of paper towels increased 3. 41 sheets per patient-day. During the same period, the prevalence rate of HAI decreased 0. 83 %. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that a significant improvement in compliance with HH can be achieved through a systemic, multidimensional intervention approach involving all categories of healthcare workers in a hospital setting, which may result in a decrease of the HAI rate...|$|R

We use a quasi-experimental, before and after, study design with prospective hospital-wide surveillance of HAIs to assess the cost effectiveness of HHPs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A 4 -year hospital-wide HHP, with particular emphasis on using an alcohol-based hand rub, was implemented in April 2004 at a 2, 200 -bed teaching hospital in Taiwan. Compliance was measured by direct observation {{and the use of}} hand <b>rub</b> <b>products.</b> Poisson regression analyses were employed to evaluate the densities and trends of HAIs during the preintervention (January 1999 to March 2004) and intervention (April 2004 to December 2007) periods. The economic impact was estimated based on a case-control study in Taiwan. We observed 8, 420 opportunities for hand hygiene during the study period. Compliance improved from 43. 3 % in April 2004 to 95. 6 % in 2007 (p<. 001), and was closely correlated with increased consumption of the alcohol-based hand rub (r =  0. 9399). The disease severity score (Charlson comorbidity index) increased (p = . 002) during the intervention period. Nevertheless, we observed an 8. 9 % decrease in HAIs and a decline in the occurrence of bloodstream, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and intensive care unit infections. The intervention had no discernable impact on HAI rates in the hematology/oncology wards. The net benefit of the HHP was US$ 5, 289, 364, and the benefit-cost ratio was 23. 7 with a 3 % discount rate. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a HHP reduces preventable HAIs and is cost effective...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Effective {{neutralization}} {{in testing}} hand hygiene preparations {{is considered to}} be a crucial element to ensure validity of the test results, especially with the difficulty to neutralize chlorhexidine gluconate. Aim of the study was to measure the effect of chemical neutralization under practical test conditions according to EN 1500. Methods We have investigated two ethanol-based hand <b>rubs</b> (<b>product</b> A, based on 61 % ethanol and 1 % chlorhexidine gluconate; product B, based on 85 % ethanol). The efficacy of products (application of 3 ml for 30 s) was compared to 2 -propanol 60 % (v/v) (two 3 ml rubs of 30 s each) on hands artificially contaminated with Escherichia coli using a cross-over design with 15 volunteers. Pre-values were obtained by rubbing fingertips for 1 minute in liquid broth. Post-values were determined by sampling immediately after disinfection in liquid broth with and without neutralizers (0. 5 % lecithin, 4 % polysorbate 20). Results The neutralizers were found to be effective and non-toxic. Without neutralization in the sampling fluid, the reference disinfection reduced the test bacteria by 3. 7 log 10, product B by 3. 3 log 10 and product A by 4. 8 log 10 (P = 0. 001; ANOVA). With neutralization the reference disinfection reduced the test bacteria by 3. 5 log 10, product B by 3. 3 log 10 and product A by 2. 7 log 10 (P = 0. 011; ANOVA). In comparison to the reference treatment Product B lead to a lower mean reduction than the reference disinfection but the difference was not significant (P > 0. 1; Wilcoxon-Wilcox test). Without neutralizing agents in the sampling fluid, product A yielded a significantly higher reduction of test bacteria (4. 8; P = 0. 02) as compared to the situation with neutralizing agents (2. 7; P = 0. 033). Conclusion The crucial step of neutralization lies in the sampling fluid itself in order to stop any residual bacteriostatic or bactericidal activity immediately after the application of the preparation, especially with chlorhexidine gluconate-containing preparations. This is particularly important at short application times such as the 30 s. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{implement}} {{and evaluate}} instruction of hand <b>rubbing</b> with alcohol-based <b>products</b> using the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and indications. Design Newly matriculated P 1 students {{were required to}} attend a 75 -minute class during which an instructor presented hand hygiene {{in the context of}} professionalism and the incidence of health care-associated infections and community-acquired antimicrobial-resistant infections in pharmacy practice settings. Students then practiced the eight-step World Health Organization (WHO) method using a WHO infographic and alcohol-based hand sanitizer and watched a New England Journal of Medicine video to reinforce skill instruction and to introduce the WHO indications for hand hygiene. Assessment Individual hand rubbing skill was assessed by individual observation using a ten-point rubric. Knowledge was tested by exam. Change in student attitudes and motivation to perform hand hygiene were measured by survey. All students (n = 77) demonstrated mastery of WHO hand rubbing. Correct answers to exam questions ranged from 83 % to 100 % per question. Student attitudes and motivation to perform hand hygiene increased significantly. Conclusions Mastery of WHO hand rubbing can be achieved with limited class time. This skill may protect both students and patients from health care-associated infections and community-acquired infections while providing a strong visual demonstration of professionalism to patients and other providers...|$|R
