Interestingly, TPABT and TPEBT, which have asymmetric structures, give obviously higher solid fluorescence quantum efficiencies in comparison with those of the corresponding symmetric structures, DTPABT and DTPEBT, respectively. In particular, the thin film of TPEBT exhibited the highest fluorescence quantum efficiency of ca. 38 % with the highest aAIE. Moreover, TPEBT and DTPEBT with TPE groups showed two-photon absorption cross-sections of (d) 1. 75 * 10 3 GM and 1. 94 * 10 3 GM at 780 nm, respectively, which are obviously higher than the other two <b>red</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>materials</b> with triphenylamine groups.

40|$|Oral {{diseases}} are worldwide {{the most common}} diseases, with dental caries and periodontal inflammatory diseases as most frequently occurring diseases. Both are strongly associated with dental plaque, which is the mass of bacteria (biofilm) that grows on surfaces in the mouth. Some dental plaque fluoresces red when illuminated with violet light. In this thesis red fluorescence of dental plaque and its applicability as an indicator for oral diseases were studied. During in vitro research {{it was found that}} the thickness and age of a biofilm are associated with fluorescence intensity. Also the nutrients available to the biofilm, affected the amount of red fluorescence: Higher fluorescence intensities were seen from biofilms grown in the presence of serum (gingivitis simulation) compared to sucrose (simulation of cariogenicity). The fluorescence was not homogeneously distributed throughout the biofilms. In vivo, the total quantity of disclosed plaque correlated moderately with <b>red</b> <b>fluorescent</b> plaque, while ‘old’ blue disclosed plaque correlated weakly with <b>red</b> <b>fluorescent</b> plaque.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Demineralisation around {{orthodontic}} brackets {{is a considerable}} risk of orthodontic treatment. It can occur very early during treatment and involve {{a large number of}} teeth with aesthetic and dental health consequences. Early detection of demineralisation is very important in terms of treatment and prevention. The presence of bacteria is one of the requirements for demineralisation to take place and it is unclear whether the type of bacteria in the plaque or the quantity of certain types of bacteria are significant influences on demineralisation. AIM: To identify any general changes in the bacterial composition of dental plaque in adolescents undergoing fixed orthodontic appliance therapy. A secondary aim is to determine the incidence of white spot lesion development and if this was related to the identified <b>red</b> <b>fluorescent</b> plaque. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal cohort study. METHODS: Fourteen 11 to 23 year old consecutive patients attending the Orthodontic Department of Liverpool University Dental Hospital were recruited for this study. ToothcareTM and QLF were used to identify <b>red</b> <b>fluorescent</b> plaque and enamel demineralisation on the labial surfaces of the anterior teeth before and after the placement of fixed orthodontic appliances. The bacterial composition of the <b>red</b> <b>fluorescent</b> supragingival plaque was determined by DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction amplification of the 16 r rRNA gene and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. 13 RESULTS: The incidence of white spot lesions was recorded as 4. 2 % of the total surfaces of the teeth included as detected with QLF, the development of white spot lesions was not associated with the presence of <b>red</b> <b>fluorescent</b> plaque. There were differences in the bacterial composition of <b>red</b> <b>fluorescent</b> supragingival plaque in terms of P. gingivalis, S. mutans and S. gordonii between different participants, although changes in the plaque composition between visits for the same participant was not significantly associated with the development of white spot lesions in adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: With the limitations of this study, the placement of fixed {{orthodontic brackets}} in adolescents does not significantly change the bacterial composition of <b>red</b> <b>fluorescent</b> supragingival plaque around the brackets and that the development of white spot lesions cannot be correlated to <b>red</b> <b>fluorescent</b> plaque alone...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A rare {{phenomenon}} of SDS-induced activation of a latent protease activity {{associated with the}} purified silkworm excretory <b>red</b> <b>fluorescent</b> protein (SE-RFP) was noticed. SE-RFP aliquots incubated with SDS for different time intervals indicated that the protein undergoes an obligatory breakdown {{into a number of}} subunits which exhibit autoproteolytic (acting upon themselves) and/or heteroproteolytic (acting on other proteins) activities. A strong serine protease activity of SE-RFP subunits on Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) polyhedral protein was detected by zymography technique. A complete inhibition of BmNPV infection to silkworms was observed by the oral administration assay of the SE-RFP. Here, it is proposed that the SE-RFP prevents the initial infection of BmNPV to silkworms by obliterating the polyhedral protein.

A two-tone disclosing solution was applied. Total disclosed plaque was clinically assessed using the mQH index. In addition, total and blue disclosed plaque was scored on clinical photographs using the mQH index. Results A strong correlation was observed between the total disclosed plaque scored on photographs and the clinical scores (r = 0. 70 at site level; r = 0. 88 at subject level). The correlation between <b>red</b> <b>fluorescent</b> plaque and total plaque, as assessed on the photographs, was moderate to strong and significant (r = 0. 50 at the site level; r = 0. 70 at the subject level), with the total plaque scores consistently higher than the <b>red</b> <b>fluorescent</b> plaque scores.
