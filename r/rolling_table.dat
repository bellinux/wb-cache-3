40|$|Objective: We {{evaluated}} {{the safety of}} simultaneous bilateral renal procedures performed using hand-assisted laparoscopy (HAL) with the patient in the supine position. Materials and Methods: After securely strapping the patient to the table, a hand-port device is placed via a 7 -cm supraumbilical or peri-umbilical incision with two to four 5 -mm to 12 -mm trocars placed bilaterally. During a 3 -year period, 8 bilateral HAL renal operations were initiated (upper pole partial nephrectomies, 3 nephroureterectomies, 3 bilateral nephrectomies, and right nephrectomy with left adrenalectomy). Results: Mean patient age was 41 years. One patient with ADPKD required conversion to open due to failure to progress secondary to excessive perirenal fat and 22 -cm kidneys. The other 7 were completed successfully with a mean operative time of 417 minutes and mean EBL of 336 cc. Two patients received transfusions. Two small splenic lacerations, managed conservatively, were the only complications. Conclusions: Bilateral hand-assisted laparoscopic renal surgery with the patient in the supine position (<b>rolling</b> the <b>table</b> side to side) is feasible {{in the majority of}} patients. However, very large kidneys (eg, ADPKD) may be better approached with the patient in the lateral decubitus position or via an open subcostal incision.

40|$|We are {{interested}} in using low degree-of-freedom robots to perform complex manipulation tasks by not grasping. By not grasping, the robot can use rolling, slipping, and free flight to control more degrees-of-freedom of the part. To demonstrate this we study the controllability properties of planar dynamic nonprehensile manipulation. We show that almost any planar object is small-time locally controllable by point contact, and the controlling robot requires only two degrees-of-freedom (a point translating in the plane). We then focus on a one joint manipulator (with a two-dimensional state space) and show that even this simplest of robots, by using slipping and rolling, can control an object to a full-dimensional subset of its six-dimensional state space. We have developed a one joint robot to perform a variety of dynamic tasks, including snatching an object from a <b>table,</b> <b>rolling</b> an object {{on the surface of}} the arm, and throwing and catching...|$|R

40|$|Conveyor belt {{cropping}} is a cropping principal that {{is characterized}} by the plants being placed in one end of the cropping area and then transported along it throughout their development. When they reach the end of the cropping area, they are fully grown and ready for harvesting. Along the cropping area there are areas where work with the plants is done. There are several advantages in using such a system. The work environment is better because the climate can be adjusted to the wishes {{of the people in the}} work areas and because individual aids can be installed. The labour requirement is reduced because work that was done earlier is no longer required and work efficiency increases thanks to the improved climate. The utilization of the cropping area increases when movable tables are installed instead of <b>rolling</b> <b>tables</b> and because there are possibilities to space plants gradually. Since the movable cropping areas with plants is one single unit, the need of transport in the firm is reduced. Some transport inputs can be omitted. The work organization is simplified because there are fewer plants in the same size category and since the batches are more numerous. This enables the usual working peaks, for instance at harvest, to be avoided. A continuous production is achieved which makes the grower less sensitive to temporary price changes in the plants grown and decreases the losses when the crop is changed. The biological advantages are that the cropping area can be split in different climates and that the climate can be adjusted to the stage of plant development. There are some requirements for conveyor belt cropping: - Uniformity in the development of plants. - The harvest time must be quite short. - Cropping areas must be movable and there must be transport equipment to move the areas. To get uniformity in development and a short harvest time the cropping must be close to the biological optimum. Therefore only one kind of plant should be present on the cropping area at the same time. This is because few crops have the same demands on environment. The plants must be genetically defined and free from diseases. During the winter the cropping will be run with inputs of carbon dioxide and illumination. Conveyor belt cropping is especially suited to crops which react uniformly to management inputs, for example in order to initiate flowering. Chrysanthemum belongs to these. Other suitable crops for conveyor belt cropping are plants with only vegetative development, for example lettuce and Hedera. To optimize the use of the cropping area a production plan ought to be prepared which considers the variation in cropping time during the year. Because the plants are moved during the cropping and the cropping time varies with radiation, the empty space after harvest can not always be filled up. A model capable of optimization will calculate how many plants are needed in the cropping area for maximum utilization. Crops with short harvest time and with slight variation in cropping time during the year are the ones best suited to conveyor belt cropping. The report ends with a description of the cropping, equipment and production planning at some growers. When better models of cropping and development are available, the possibilities to controll the crops will increase and more kinds of plants will become suitable for conveyor belt cropping. There are also good opportunities to automate the cropping system to reduce human labour inputs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we present an {{implicit}} time-stepping scheme for multibody systems with intermittent contact by incorporating the contact constraints {{as a set}} of complementarity and algebraic equations within the dynamics model. Two primary sources of stability and accuracy problems in prior time stepping schemes for differential complementarity models of multibody systems are the use of polyhedral representations of smooth bodies and the approximation of the distance function (arising from the decoupling of collision detection from the solution of the dynamic time-stepping subproblem). Even the simple example of a disc <b>rolling</b> on a <b>table</b> without slip encounters these problems. We assume each object to be a convex object described by an intersection of convex inequalities. We write the contact constraints as complementarity constraints between the contact force and a distance function dependent on the closest points on the objects. The closest points satisfy a set of algebraic constraints obtained from the KKT conditions of the minimum distance problem. These algebraic equations and the complementarity constraints taken together ensure satisfaction of the contact constraints. This enables us to formulate a geometrically implicit time-stepping scheme (i. e., we do not need to approximate the distance function) as a nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP). The resulting time-stepper is therefore more accurate; further it is the first geometrically implicit time-stepper that does not rely on a closed form expression for the distance function. We demonstrate through example simulations the fidelity of this approach to analytical solutions and previously described simulation results. I...|$|R
