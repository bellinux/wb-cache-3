50|$|As a {{judicial}} officer, Bird had acquired insight into land ownership in India, {{and the impact}} on it of the legal framework.

Retaining his seat as a member of board of revenue <b>recently</b> <b>constituted</b> at Allahabad, he took sole charge of the settlement operations, which he brought to completion by the end of 1841. The conclusions were stated in a major report. Bird retired from the service in 1842, and was succeeded on the board of revenue by James Thomason.|$|R
40|$|Theoretical {{debate about}} the nature of {{charitable}} foundations has traditionally become polarized around two distinct conceptual approaches: the non-profit or third sector approach, versus the social economy approach. This research tries to find a common ground between these two approaches, and to highlight the specificities of the foundation as an organizational formula, supporting its current socio-economic relevance with latest quantitative data on the contemporary Spanish foundation sector. In order to achieve this purpose, data from the main empirical studies about the sector during the last decade are compared, with a special focus on those obtained by the <b>recently</b> <b>constituted</b> Institute for Strategic Analysis of Foundations (INAEF). Foundations, social economy, non-profit organizations, third sector, socioeconomic impact, INAEF. ...|$|R

We here report the use of a <b>recently</b> <b>constituted</b> contig of cosmid, BAC, and P 1 clones that allowed new polymorphic markers to be positioned. These were typed in 53 unrelated disease families from an isolated Finnish population in which a putative single ancestral EPM 1 mutation has segregated for an estimated 100 generations.

50|$|Considered one of {{the strongest}} fortifications in the Atlantic Wall, Le Havre was also aided by strong natural defences that {{included}} bodies of water preventing access from the south, east and west. The north side of the port was heavily fortified, with a 6 - 7 m deep and 3 m wide anti-tank ditch stretching across the entire approach, pillboxes fitted with anti-tank and machine guns and 1,500 mines. Intelligence before the attack estimated there were between 7,300 and 8,700 soldiers in the city, of which 4,000 were artillery troops, 1,300 were naval personnel and the rest a mixture of low-quality infantry and a battalion from the <b>recently</b> <b>constituted</b> 36th Grenadier Regiment formed out of the survivors of the 36th Infantry Division after its destruction at Bobruysk in Belarus in June 1944.|$|R
40|$|The use of Life Cycle Cost (LCC) {{tools in}} civil {{engineering}} is increasing, {{due to the}} need of infrastructure owners and operators to guarantee their assets maximum performance with an optimized budget.

40|$|Is {{there any}} reason to {{discriminate}} among the rival claims self-proclaimed conservatives make for being truly conservative? This article argues {{that at least some of}} these claims can legitimately be dismissed by an independent third. Drawing on and critically interrogating the theories of conservatism provided by Huntington, Oakeshott, as well as Brennan and Hamlin, this article argues that many characterizations of conservatism mistake contingent circumstances explaining why people historically were or conceivably might be reluctant to promote social change for a fully-formed conservative ideology. Not least, risk- and uncertainty-centred accounts, which have gained in popularity as of <b>recently,</b> <b>constitute</b> no viable basis for plausible claims to being truly conservative. Rather than specifying what it takes to be a true conservative, these accounts provide a formalized description of one kind of contingent circumstances that may lead a principled non-conservative to adopt conservative political attitudes...|$|R
40|$|Negation has <b>recently</b> <b>constituted</b> a {{fascinating}} {{area of study}} both in descriptive and theoretical linguistics because of the varying positions that the negative morpheme occupies in the world's languages {{and the need to}} determine the position of this morpheme at Deep Structure. In addition, while some languages employ a single negative morpheme ubiquitously, some others employ more than three morphemes, with the use of many of the morphemes predicated on the tense of the verb. This paper investigates the structure of negative constructions in Mokpe and two related coastal Bantu languages of Cameroon. Although Mokpe and these other languages employ two or more negative morphemes, these morphemes are not free variants; the use of any of them is constrained by the tense/aspect of the verb under consideration. A "Principles and Parameters Theory" treatment of negation in Mokpe is offered...|$|R

40|$|Central to most {{research}} in the field of creativity is the perception that creativity is an external and essentialist phenomenon. Recent studies, particularly in the area of art and design education, are beginning to question this understanding and seek alternative methods for exploring creativity. This paper takes the view that perceptions of creativity are historically and discursively constructed and that cultural shifts {{in the early twentieth century}} have more <b>recently</b> <b>constituted</b> the western understanding of creativity through a discourse of work. As an example, the paper will use a multi-perspectival analytical approach to explore the discursive construction of creativity as work in the situated context of a tertiary art and design studio environment. The paper concludes with a discussion of complications that may arise in the tertiary art and design environment as a result of the potential ambiguity created by the discourse of creativity as work. 21 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In this study, we {{aimed to}} test the {{performance}} of risk parity portfolios against classically optimized Markowitz portfolios and conclude which technique leads to better performing portfolios in well developed, informationally efficient markets. We constructed 5 risk parity portfolios, the Inverse Volatility portfolio, the Maximum Diversification portfolio, the Equal Risk Contribution portfolio, the Alpha Risk Parity portfolio and the Beta Risk Parity portfolio and 2 benchmark classical portfolios, the Equally Weighted (1 /N) and the Minimum Variance portfolio to measure performance against. The data used is the 50 <b>constituting</b> <b>stocks</b> of the EuroSTOXX 50 index. The index itself {{was used as the}} market benchmark that was included in the analysis. The study is designed in a horse race style measuring performance using mean returns, mean excess returns, maximum drawdowns, Sharpe ratios and information ratios. Our findings indicate that a risk parity portfolio will win the horse race against a classical portfolio, however risk parity portfolios are very sensitive to the asset universe and to make the most out of these techniques, a wide asset scope, managerial skill as well as other resources are needed which might not make them easily available to the average investor...|$|R

50|$|On 25 September 1764 {{he arrived}} {{with his family}} at Halifax, Nova Scotia, having been {{appointed}} judge of the vice-admiralty court over all America, which had been <b>recently</b> <b>constituted</b> by act of parliament. In the proclamation that announces {{the opening of the}} court he is styled “The Right Worshipful William Spry, Doctor of Laws.” The other officers of the new court were: vice-admiral, the Earl of Northumberland; registrar, the Hon. Spencer Percival; marshal, Charles Howard, gent. These officers probably expected to fulfil their duties by deputies. Judge Spry opened his court at Halifax on 9 October 1764. Its creation had been opposed in the colonies, and the passage of the Stamp Act the next year, with the accompanying disturbances, probably prevented its extension to other provinces. The Court was abolished in 1768. Judge Spry was appointed Governor of Barbados in June 1767. Spry arrived at Barbados the following year, and died in office in 1772.|$|R
