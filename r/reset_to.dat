5|$|On November 21, 2015, 10586 was {{temporarily}} pulled from public distribution. The upgrade was re-instated on November 24, 2015, with Microsoft {{stating that the}} removal was due to a bug that caused privacy and data collection settings to be <b>reset</b> <b>to</b> defaults when installing the upgrade.|$|E
5|$|Some users {{reported}} {{that during the}} installation of the November upgrade, some applications (particularly utility programs such as CPU-Z and Speccy) were automatically uninstalled during the upgrade process, and some default programs were <b>reset</b> <b>to</b> Microsoft-specified defaults (such as Photos app, and Microsoft Edge for PDF viewing), both without warning.|$|E
5000|$|One obvious {{application}} of forged TCP <b>reset</b> is <b>to</b> maliciously disrupt TCP connections {{without the consent}} of the two parties which own the endpoints. However, network security systems using forged TCP resets have been designed as well. A prototype [...] "Buster" [...] software package was demonstrated in 1995 that would send forged <b>resets</b> <b>to</b> any TCP connection which used port numbers in a short list. Linux volunteers proposed doing something similar with Linux firewalls in 2000, and the open source Snort used TCP <b>resets</b> <b>to</b> disrupt suspicious connections as early as 2003.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{modification}} {{to the existing}} anticollision protocol put forth in version 1. 0 Protocol Specification for 900 MHz Class 0 RFID Tag. The version 1. 0 specification uses a binary tree approach to singulate one RF tag ID at a time.

The present standard <b>resets</b> <b>to</b> the root node of the binary tree for every read cycle...|$|R
5000|$|By late 2007, Comcast {{began using}} forged TCP <b>resets</b> <b>to</b> cripple {{peer-to-peer}} and certain groupware applications on their customers' computers. This started a controversy, which {{was followed by}} the creation of the Network Neutrality Squad (NNSquad) by Lauren Weinstein, Vint Cerf, David Farber, Craig Newmark and other well-known founders of and champions of openness on the Internet. In 2008, the NNSquad released the NNSquad Network Measurement Agent, a Windows software program written by John Bartas, which could detect Comcast's forged TCP resets and distinguish them from real endpoint-generated <b>resets.</b> The technology <b>to</b> detect the <b>resets</b> was developed from the earlier open-source [...] "Buster" [...] software which used forged <b>resets</b> <b>to</b> block malware and ads in web pages.|$|R
5|$|Closed circuit rebreathers {{are usually}} {{controlled}} {{to provide a}} fairly constant partial pressure of oxygen during the dive (set point), and may be <b>reset</b> <b>to</b> a richer mix for decompression. The effect {{is to keep the}} partial pressure of inert gases as low as safely practicable throughout the dive. This minimizes the absorption of inert gas in the first place, and accelerates the elimination of the inert gases during ascent.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{her four}} funnels were removed, and the forward two were cut {{at an angle}} to {{resemble}} those of a German destroyer. The bow was packed with 4.5 tons of high explosives, which were set in concrete. It was decided that the explosive charge would be timed to detonate after the raiders had left the harbour. To prevent the Germans towing her away, the crew would open the ship's seacocks before abandoning the ship. Should she become disabled or sunk before getting to the dock, four motor launches had been detailed to take off the crew and put the commandos ashore. The charge would be <b>reset</b> <b>to</b> explode after the last boat had left.|$|E
5|$|While it {{contains}} some small role-playing elements, Dawn of Mana diverges from the prior two-dimensional action role-playing game titles {{of the series}} to focus directly on action-adventure gameplay in a full 3D world. Incorporating the Havok physics engine, the gameplay focuses on the player grabbing and throwing objects and monsters in order to startle enemies before attacking them with a sword and magic. Keldric grows more powerful as the player journeys through an area, only to <b>reset</b> <b>to</b> his base abilities with each new zone unless difficult extra challenges are met. Unlike many of its predecessors, the game does not feature any cooperative multiplayer component.|$|E

5|$|Each {{season of}} the series is played as a nine-episode tournament with six episodes of opening rounds, two semi-finals, and a final. Each opening round starts with three teams of three contestants {{answering}} questions about the Bible. The teams then nominate their strongest contestants to answer questions by themselves without any assistance from their teammates. After {{this part of the}} round, the third-placed team is eliminated and the two highest-scoring teams compete in a final round with the scores being <b>reset</b> <b>to</b> zero. The remaining teams answer as many questions correctly as possible within one minute, and the highest-scoring team from this round wins a $20,000 prize which is given to the team's nominated charity. The winning team then advances to a semi-final game against two other winning teams; the winning team from this game advances to a final game where the grand prize is raised to $100,000. Thus, the team that wins the season-long tournament earns a total of $140,000 for their charity.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} {{successfully}} matches {{a number of}} consecutive notes correctly, they boost their individual scoring multiplier up to a maximum 4x value; missing a note will <b>reset</b> <b>to</b> the multiplier back to 1x. Throughout each song's respective charts for the instruments are special highlighted phrases; completing all the notes in this phrase, and for guitar/bass players, using the whammy bar on marked sustained notes, fills part of a Star Power meter. When this meter is at least half full, the player can activate Star Power by performing special actions on their controllers: either tilting the guitar controller upward briefly or pressing the Star Power activation button for guitar and bass; striking two pads simultaneously on the drums; and either double tapping the microphone or pressing one of the buttons on the game console's regular controllers for vocals. When Star Power is activated, the overall band scoring multiplier is increased for a limited time until the Star Power meter is drained. After completing a song, the band is awarded a number of stars based on the overall score; in normal modes for Warriors of Rock, up to six stars can be earned; the final being achievable only through zero misses and zero extra strums.|$|E

50|$|A shutter {{cycle is}} the process of the shutter opening, closing, and <b>resetting</b> <b>to</b> where it is ready to open again. The life-expectancy of a {{mechanical}} shutter is often expressed as a number of shutter cycles.|$|R

25|$|Also in FIBA play, if {{the offense}} retains {{control of a}} ball {{following}} a rebound, the shot clock is <b>reset</b> <b>to</b> 14 seconds.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{a referee}} can impose a {{double or triple}} minor. The infraction is counted as two or three {{separate}} minor penalties. If a team scores a power play goal during such a penalty, only the current block of two minutes being counted down is canceled; the penalty clock is then <b>reset</b> <b>to</b> the next lowest interval of two minutes (ex. a goal with a double-minor penalty clock at 3:45 is <b>reset</b> <b>to</b> 2:00). Expiration rules of double- or triple-minor penalties due to goals being scored are identical to that of regular minor penalties being served back-to-back.|$|E
25|$|In September 2013, the ICC {{announced}} {{that for a}} trial period starting in October 2013, a team's referrals would be <b>reset</b> <b>to</b> two after 80 overs in an innings in Test matches. Previously each team had a maximum of two unsuccessful reviews in an innings.|$|E

25|$|If {{the scores}} are {{identical}} {{at the end}} of the match, the contest is resolved by the Golden Score rule.

50|$|This form of {{oscillator}} sync is less common. This form is {{very similar}} to Hard Sync, with one small difference. In Reversing Soft Sync, rather than <b>resetting</b> <b>to</b> zero, the wave is inverted; that is, its direction is reversed. Reversing Soft Sync is more associated with analog triangle core oscillators than analog sawtooth core oscillators.|$|R
