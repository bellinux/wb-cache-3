25|$|The single-seat F-15C and two-seat F-15D models entered {{production}} in 1978 and conducted their first flights in February and June of that year. These models were fitted with the Production Eagle Package (PEP 2000), which included 2,000 lb (900kg) of additional internal fuel, provisions for exterior conformal fuel tanks, {{and an increased}} maximum takeoff weight of up to 68,000lb (30,700kg). The increased takeoff weight allows internal fuel, a full weapons load, conformal fuel tanks, and three external fuel tanks to be carried. The APG-63 radar uses a programmable signal processor (PSP), enabling the radar to be <b>reprogrammable</b> for additional purposes such as the addition of new armaments and equipment. The PSP {{was the first of}} its kind in the world, and the upgraded APG-63 radar was the first radar to use it. Other improvements included strengthened landing gear, a new digital central computer, and an overload warning system, which allows the pilot to fly up to 9 g at all weights.|$|E

2500|$|To {{accomplish}} this, {{a series}} of [...] "trigger" [...] stages are employed. All the data from each crossing is held in buffers within the detector while {{a small amount of}} key information is used to perform a fast, approximate calculation to identify features of interest such as high energy jets, muons or missing energy. This [...] "Level 1" [...] calculation is completed in around 1nbsp&µs, and event rate is reduced by a factor of about thousand down to 50nbsp&kHz. All these calculations are done on fast, custom hardware using <b>reprogrammable</b> field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA).|$|E

50|$|Intel {{processors}} have <b>reprogrammable</b> microcode {{since the}} P6 microarchitecture. The BIOS may contain patches to the processor microcode that fix {{errors in the}} initial processor microcode; reprogramming is not persistent, thus loading of microcode updates is performed each time the system is powered up. Without <b>reprogrammable</b> microcode, an expensive processor swap would be required; for example, the Pentium FDIV bug became an expensive fiasco for Intel as it required a product recall because the original Pentium processor's defective microcode could not be reprogrammed.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, the Naval Surface Warfare Center funded an {{experiment}} proposed by Steve Casselman {{to develop a}} computer that would implement 600,000 <b>reprogrammable</b> gates. Casselman was successful and a patent related to the system was issued in 1992.|$|E
50|$|Many early computers, {{such as the}} Atanasoff-Berry computer, {{were not}} <b>reprogrammable.</b> They {{executed}} a single hardwired program. As there were no program instructions, no program storage was necessary. Other computers, though programmable, stored their programs on punched tape, which was physically fed into the machine as needed.|$|E
50|$|Altera {{was founded}} in 1983 and {{delivered}} the industry's first <b>reprogrammable</b> logic device in 1984 - the EP300 - which featured a quartz window in the package that allowed users to shine an ultra-violet lamp on the die to erase the EPROM cells that held the device configuration.|$|E
50|$|The Open Graphics Project (OGP) {{was founded}} {{with the goal}} to design an {{open-source}} hardware / open architecture and standard for graphics cards, primarily targeting free software / open-source operating systems. The project created a <b>reprogrammable</b> development and prototyping board and had aimed to eventually produce a full-featured and competitive end-user graphics card.|$|E
50|$|Another {{good example}} {{of a system that}} relied on semigraphical {{characters}} is the venerable Sharp MZ80K, which had no high-resolution graphics, nor <b>reprogrammable</b> characters, but relied fully on an extended font set with many pseudo graphical characters. With these it was still possible to generate games that looked like the system had high-resolution graphics.|$|E
50|$|All {{of these}} {{technologies}} improved {{the flexibility of}} ROM, but at a significant cost-per-chip, so that in large quantities mask ROM would remain an economical choice for many years. (Decreasing cost of <b>reprogrammable</b> devices had almost eliminated the market for mask ROM by the year 2000.) Rewriteable technologies were envisioned as replacements for mask ROM.|$|E
50|$|The {{replacement}} FIM-92C {{had been}} developed from 1984 and production began in 1987. The first examples were delivered to front-line units in 1989. C-type missiles were fitted with a <b>reprogrammable</b> electronics system to allow for upgrades. The missiles which received a counter-measures upgrade were designated D and later upgrades to the D were designated G.|$|E
50|$|Exosat was {{the first}} ESA {{spacecraft}} to carry on board a digital computer (OBC), with its main purpose being scientific data processing. Spacecraft monitoring and control were secondary. To provide the data handling subsystem with an exceptional flexibility of operation, the OBC and Central Terminal Unit were in-flight <b>reprogrammable.</b> This flexibility far exceeded any other ESA spacecraft built up to then.|$|E
50|$|The EPROM was {{nonvolatile}} and <b>reprogrammable.</b> It was {{the catalyst}} for innovations and developments that led to flash memory technology. The EPROM was also a key innovation in the personal computer industry. Intel founder Gordon Moore called it “as important {{in the development of}} the microcomputer industry as the microprocessor itself.” It remained Intel’s most profitable product well into the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|It {{was not a}} Turing {{complete}} computer, which distinguishes it {{from more}} general machines, like contemporary Konrad Zuse's Z3 (1941), or later machines like the 1946 ENIAC, the 1949 EDVAC, the University of Manchester designs, or Alan Turing's post-War design of ACE at NPL and elsewhere. Nor did it implement the stored program architecture that made practical fully general-purpose, <b>reprogrammable</b> computers.|$|E
50|$|The first Bars series radar was the N011, {{which was}} {{originally}} an X band Pulse-Doppler radar {{developed for the}} Su-27. In this original N011 form, it deployed a mechanically scanned planar array with 960 mm diameter, ±85 degrees scan sector. The peak output power reached 8 kW {{with an average of}} 2 kW. The N011 features a low noise UHF input amplifier, and fully digitized signal processing unit using <b>reprogrammable</b> digital computers.|$|E
5000|$|The KSV-21 was {{originally}} built by SafeNet but {{has since been}} purchased by Raytheon [...] as a tamper-resistant <b>reprogrammable</b> module and is backwards compatible with the KOV-14 Fortezza Plus card. It adds features including support for SCIP, Enhanced Firefly and NSA's 21st century Key Management Initiative. It can perform Type 1 encryption and hash operations at 80 Mbit/s. As of 2008, the KOV-14 is beginning to be phased out and replaced by the KSV-21.|$|E
5000|$|Industrial {{service robots}} {{can be used}} to carry out simple tasks, such as {{examining}} welding, as well as more complex, harsh-environment tasks, such as aiding in the dismantling of nuclear power stations. Industrial robots have been defined by the International Federation of Robotics as [...] "an automatically controlled, <b>reprogrammable,</b> multipurpose manipulator programmable in three or more axes, which may be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications".|$|E
5000|$|Mode S {{equipped}} {{aircraft are}} assigned a unique ICAO 24-bit address or (informally) Mode-S [...] "hex code" [...] upon national registration and this address becomes {{a part of}} the aircraft's Certificate of Registration. Normally, the address is never changed, however, the transponders are <b>reprogrammable</b> and, occasionally, are moved from one aircraft to another (presumably for operational or cost purposes), either by maintenance or by changing the appropriate entry in the aircraft's Flight management system.|$|E
50|$|Bixby {{comes with}} three parts, known as Bixby Voice, Bixby Vision and Bixby Home. With Bixby Voice, the user can trigger Bixby by calling it or {{pressing}} {{and holding the}} button located below the volume rocker, dubbed the Bixby Button. A while before the phone's release, the Bixby Button was <b>reprogrammable</b> and could be set to open other applications or assistants, such as Google Assistant. Near the phone's release, however, this ability was removed with a firmware update.|$|E
50|$|Cumma was a Catalyst {{company that}} created a {{self-serve}} kiosk and <b>reprogrammable</b> video game cartridges. The intent was that a video game user - even a child - could use the kiosk to load a new game for $5-$10 via the kiosk, rather than buy a full new cartridge for a game that may have a short practical play life. Cumma launched with great fanfare at the Consumer Electronics Show in 1984, but ultimately {{did not come to}} market.|$|E
50|$|The 92-93 LT1s used speed density fuel management, batch-fire fuel {{injection}} and a dedicated Engine Control Module (ECM). In 94 the LT1 {{switched to a}} mass airflow sensor and sequential port injection. A new, more capable computer controlled the transmission {{as well as the}} engine and got a new name: Powertrain Control Module (PCM). Where the EC5M held its calibration information in a replaceable PROM chip, the 94-95 OBD1 PCMs are <b>reprogrammable</b> through the diagnostic port.|$|E
50|$|The AIM-9M-8/9 {{incorporated}} {{replacement of}} five circuit cards {{and the related}} parentboard to update infrared counter counter measures (IRCCM) capability to improve 9M capability against the latest threat IRCM. The first AIM-9M-8/9 modifications, fielded in 1995, involved deskinning the guidance section and substitution of circuit cards at the depot level, which is labor-intensive and expensive—as well as removing missiles from inventory during the upgrade period. The AIM-9X concept is to use <b>reprogrammable</b> software to permit upgrades without disassembly.|$|E
