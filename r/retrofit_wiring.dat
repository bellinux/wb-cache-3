50|$|In 2012, Leviton {{launched}} its Universal Dimming device line which dims any dimmable light-emitting diode, compact fluorescent light, or incandescent lightbulb. This results in dramatic energy savings. The company also released its Zipline Fluorescent Energy Retrofit Module, which eliminated <b>retrofit</b> <b>wiring</b> of ballasts.|$|E
50|$|The alleged {{torture and}} homicides {{took place at}} the {{military}} detention center known as the Bagram Theater Internment Facility, which had been built by the Soviets as an aircraft machine shop during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (1980-1989). A concrete-and-sheet metal facility that was <b>retrofitted</b> with <b>wire</b> pens and wooden isolation cells, the center is part of Bagram Air Base in the ancient city of Bagram near Charikar in Parvan, Afghanistan.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{intercom}} systems communicated over {{a set of}} low-voltage signal wires {{installed in}} {{the walls of a}} building. The installation was typically done during the buildingâ€™s construction, but buildings could be <b>retrofitted</b> with communication <b>wires,</b> at a cost. Non-radio [...] "wireless" [...] intercom designs were developed that used a building's existing electrical wiring to carry communication signals. Such systems work similarly to normal wired intercom designs, with intercom stations using wires to connect to electrical outlets in rooms. This method of intercom connection is most useful in offices and homes served by a single electrical service. Products are available from a variety of manufacturers including Westinghouse and GE.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} shear performances of reinforced concrete beams <b>retrofitted</b> by using <b>wire</b> mesh and Self Compacting Concrete (SCC). Four concrete beams reinforced internally with steel and externally with both wire mesh (?? 4, 06 mm) and SCC (25 mm) applied to the specimens were tested under three-point bending. The shear failure was initiated by a major diagonal crack within the beam shear span. This diagonal crack extended horizontally at the level of the wire mesh. Results show that SCC with wire mesh is very effective for shear retrofitting. Increases in shear capacity of 71. 82 % for BWS over the BN as control, un-retrofitted beams were noted...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{conducted}} several flexural {{tests of}} RC (reinforced concrete) columns retrofitted by SMA (shape memory alloy) wires. The RC columns with lap spliced reinforcements {{at the base}} show less ductile behaviour than those with continuous reinforcements. SMA wire jackets can increase the ductility of the RC columns with lap spliced reinforcements and thus this study used the two kinds of SMA <b>wires</b> to <b>retrofit</b> such RC columns; {{the first one is}} NiTi SMA wire that remains in martensite at room temperature and the other is NiTiNb SMA wire that is austenite at room temperature. Both the SMA wires show shape memory effect and provide active confinement for concrete. The SMA wires were prestrained to 7 % strain and released. At the state, some residual strain remained and can be recovered by heating. The prestrained SMA wires were wrapped around the plastic hinge region of the RC columns and then the temperature of the wires raised by heating. Then, the SMA wires induced an active confinement on the RC columns. Each wire was measured for recovery and residual stress to obtain the information of active confinement. This active confinement and the resistance of the SMA wires increased the ductile behaviour of the RC columns in lateral direction. The parameters in this study are the kinds of SMA and the pitch of the wires. All types of the specimens <b>retrofitted</b> the SMA <b>wires</b> showed good ductile behaviour without degrading the flexural strength...|$|R
