5|$|After SpongeBob and Patrick leave, Plankton steals the Krabby Patty {{formula and}} {{uses it to}} produce and sell Krabby Patties at his restaurant, the Chum Bucket, {{claiming}} that Krabs bequeathed him the <b>recipe.</b> <b>As</b> a contingency, he hires a hitman named Dennis to eliminate SpongeBob and Patrick. Squidward discovers the truth about Plankton stealing Neptune's crown and tries to alert Neptune. However, Plankton uses mind-controlling bucket helmets, disguised as souvenirs, to control Bikini Bottom's residents, including Squidward, and renames the city Planktopolis and exiles Mindy.|$|E
25|$|On the Mediterranean coast, Valencians used seafood {{instead of}} meat and beans to make paella. Valencians regard this <b>recipe</b> <b>as</b> authentic, as well. In this recipe, the seafood is served in the shell. A variant on this is paella del senyoret which uses seafood without shells. Later, however, Spaniards living outside of Valencia {{combined}} seafood with meat from land animals and mixed paella was born. This paella is sometimes called preparación barroca (baroque preparation) due to the variety of ingredients and its final presentation.|$|E

500|$|Curry {{was created}} by the arrival of the British in India in the seventeenth century, {{beginning}} as bowls of spicy sauce used, Lizzie Collingham writes, to add [...] "bite to the rather bland flavours of boiled and roasted meats." [...] The 1758 edition of Hannah Glasse's The Art of Cookery contains what Clarissa Dickson Wright calls a [...] "famous recipe" [...] which describes how [...] "To make a currey the Indian way"; it flavours chicken with onions fried in butter, the chicken being fried with turmeric, ginger and ground pepper, and stewed in its own stock with cream and lemon juice. Dickson Wright comments that she was [...] "a bit sceptical" [...] of this <b>recipe,</b> <b>as</b> it had few of the expected spices, but was [...] "pleasantly surprised by the end result" [...] which had [...] "a very good and interesting flavour".|$|E
2500|$|On February 1, 2015, the University of Oklahoma's {{newspaper}} OU Daily {{ran a story}} regarding White's February 2 show at McCasland Field House {{that included}} the publication of White's tour rider. The rider, especially the guacamole recipe it included and White's ban of bananas backstage, received significant media coverage. It was later reported that {{in response to the}} rider's publication White's booking agency, William Morris Endeavor Entertainment, had banned its acts from playing shows at the University of Oklahoma. On February 15 White released an open letter addressed to [...] "journalists and other people looking for drama or a diva" [...] in which he referred to the guacamole <b>recipe</b> <b>as</b> his tour manager's [...] "inside joke with local promoters" [...] and [...] "just something to break up the boredom" [...] while criticizing journalists who wrote about the rider as [...] "out of their element." [...] In the same letter he forgave OU Daily for publishing the story and reaffirmed his desire to perform in Oklahoma.|$|E
2500|$|The {{marketing}} management school, {{evolved in the}} late 1950s and early 1960s, is fundamentally linked with the marketing mix framework, a business tool used in marketing and by marketers. In his paper [...] "The Concept of the Marketing Mix", Neil H. Borden reconstructed {{the history of the}} term [...] "marketing mix". [...] He started teaching the term after an associate, James Culliton, described the role of the marketing manager in 1948 as a [...] "mixer of ingredients"; one who sometimes follows recipes prepared by others, sometimes prepares his own <b>recipe</b> <b>as</b> he goes along, sometimes adapts a recipe from immediately available ingredients, and at other times invents new ingredients no one else has tried. The marketer E. Jerome McCarthy proposed a four Ps classification (Product, Price, Promotion, Place) in 1960, which has since been used by marketers throughout the world. Robert F. Lauterborn proposed a four Cs classification (Consumer, Price, Promotion, Place) in 1990 which is a more consumer-oriented version of the four Ps that attempts to better fit the movement from mass marketing to niche marketing. Koichi Shimizu proposed a 7Cs Compass Model (corporation, commodity, cost, communication, channel, consumer, circumstances) to provide a more complete picture of the nature of marketing in 1981.|$|E

2500|$|Brussels waffles are {{prepared}} with an egg-white-leavened or yeast-leavened batter, traditionally an ale yeast; occasionally {{both types of}} leavening are used together. They are lighter, crisper and have larger pockets compared to other European waffle varieties, and are easy to differentiate from Liège Waffles by their rectangular sides. In Belgium, most waffles are served warm by street vendors and dusted with confectioner's sugar, though in tourist areas they might be topped with whipped cream, soft fruit or chocolate spread. Variants of the Brussels waffles – with whipped and folded egg whites cooked in large rectangular forms – date from the 18th century. However, the oldest recognized reference to [...] "Gaufres de Bruxelles" [...] (Brussels Waffles) by name is attributed from 1842/43 to Florian Dacher, a Swiss baker in Ghent, Belgium, who had previously worked under pastry chefs in central Brussels. Philippe Cauderlier would later publish Dacher's recipe in the 1874 edition of his recipe book [...] "La Pâtisserie et la Confiture". Maximilien Consael, another Ghent chef, had claimed to have invented the waffles in 1839, though there's no written record of him either naming or selling the waffles until his participation in the 1856 Brussels Fair. It {{should be noted that}} neither man created the recipe; they simply popularized and formalized an existing <b>recipe</b> <b>as</b> the Brussels waffle.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{see nothing}} else so {{remarkable}} in this <b>recipe,</b> <b>as</b> {{that it is}} chiefly made up {{of some of the}} commonest things that grow; plants that you set your foot upon at your very threshold, in your garden, in your wood-walks, wherever you go. I doubt not old Aunt Keziah knows them, and very likely she has brewed them up in that hell-drink, the remembrance of which is still rankling in my stomach. I thought I had swallowed the Devil himself, whom the old woman had been boiling down. It would be curious enough if the hideous decoction was the same as old Friar Bacon and his acolyte discovered by their science! One ingredient, however, one of those plants, I scarcely think the old lady can have put into her pot of Devil's elixir; for it is a rare plant, that does not grow in these parts." ...|$|E
6000|$|On the whole, the apothecary had as {{comfortable}} {{a time as}} a man of his years could expect. The air of the house and of the old graveyard seemed to suit him. What so seldom happens in man's advancing age, his night's rest did him good, whereas, generally, an old man wakes up ten times as nervous and dispirited as he went to bed, just as if, during his sleep he had been working harder than ever he did in the daytime. It had been so with the Doctor himself till within a few months. To be sure, he had latterly begun to practise various rules of diet and exercise, which commended themselves to his approbation. He sawed some of his own fire- wood, and fancied that, as was reasonable, it fatigued him less day by day. He took walks with Pansie, and though, of course, her little footsteps, treading on the elastic air of childhood, far outstripped his own, still the old man knew that he was not beyond the recuperative period of life, and that exercise out of doors and proper food can do somewhat towards retarding the approach of age. He was inclined, also, to impute much good effect to a daily dose of Santa Cruz rum (a liquor much in vogue in that day), which he was now in the habit of quaffing at the meridian hour. All through the Doctor's life he had eschewed strong spirits: [...] "But after seventy," [...] quoth old Dr. Dolliver, [...] "a man is all the better in head and stomach for a little stimulus"; and it certainly seemed so in his case. Likewise, I know not precisely how often, but complying punctiliously with the <b>recipe,</b> <b>as</b> an apothecary naturally would, he took his drop of the mysterious cordial.|$|E
