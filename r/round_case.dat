40|$|Objectives: Since its introduction, {{there have}} been many {{refinements}} in the technique and implementation of robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). However, it is unclear whether operative outcomes are influenced by surgical case order. We evaluated the effect of case order on perioperative outcomes for RARP within a large health maintenance organization. Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of RARP cases performed at our institution from September 2008 to December 2010 using a single robotic platform. Case order was determined from surgical schedules each day and surgeries were grouped into 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd <b>round</b> <b>cases.</b> Fourth <b>round</b> <b>cases</b> (n = 1) were excluded from analysis. We compared clinicopathological variables including operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), surgical margin rates and complication rates between groups. Results: Of the 1018 RARP cases in this cohort, 476 (47 %) were performed as 1 st <b>round</b> <b>cases,</b> 398 (39 %) 2 nd <b>round</b> <b>cases</b> and 144 (14 %) 3 rd <b>round</b> <b>cases</b> by a total of 18 surgeons. Mean operative time was shorter as cases were performed later in the day (213 min vs. 209 min vs. 180 min, P < 0. 0001) and similarly, EBL also decreased with surgical order (136 mL vs. 134 mL vs. 103 mL, P = 0. 01). Transfusion rates, surgical margin rates and complication rates did not significantly differ between groups. Patients undergoing RARP later in the day {{were much more likely to}} have a hospital stay of 2 or more days than earlier cases (10 % vs. 11 % vs. 32 %, P = 0. 01). Conclusions: Surgical case order may influence perioperative outcomes for RARP with decreased operative times and increased length of hospital stay associated with later cases. These findings indicate that select perioperative factors may improve with ascending case order as the surgical team "warms up" during the day. In addition, 3 rd <b>round</b> <b>cases</b> can increase hospital costs associated with increased lengths of hospital stay. Knowledge of these differences may assist in surgical planning to improve outcomes and limit costs...|$|R

50|$|Milk is {{a product}} of great demand all year round. As a result of this demand, farmers have been given an {{incentive}} to produce milk during winter months. In order to achieve this public demand for milk, dairy farmers needed to change their breeding routines. estrous synchronization enabled this change in the herdâs breeding routine to allow dairy farmers to produce milk for human consumption year <b>round.</b> <b>Case</b> studies for the productivity of these incentives on dairy farms have shown to have positive results.Oestrus synchronisation has proven to have many advantages in the dairy and beef industries. The application of estrous synchronisation enables the farmer to reduce costs involved in the hire of AI technicians and semen import. Concentrated calving and uniform weaning saves time and is cheaper than having individual cows in heat throughout the year.However, there are also disadvantages with estrous synchronisation. It requires a high level of management and skills to be able to manage numerous calving operations at a synchronised time. Furthermore, maintaining nutrition and herd health are major factors {{when it comes to the}} achieving optimum reproductive performance through estrous synchronisation.|$|E

40|$|HËastad et al. (2008) prove, using Razâs lemma (STOC â 95) {{the first}} {{efficient}} parallel repetition theorem for protocols with a non-constant number of rounds, for a natural generalization of public-coin protocols. They {{show that a}} parallel prover that convinces a fraction 1 â Î³ of the embedded verifiers of a k-wise repeated m-message verifier {{can be turned into}} a prover with error probability 1 â Î³ â O(m â â log (É) /k). This improves previous results of Impagliazzo et al.

An important implication of the strengthened parallel repetition theorem is the first efficient concurrent repetition theorem for protocols with a non-constant number of rounds. In concurrent repetition, the verifiers execute completely independently and only report their final decision, i. e., the prover chooses arbitrarily in which order it interacts with the individual verifiers. This should be contrasted with parallel repetition where the verifiers are synchronized in each round. ...|$|E

40|$|A 35 -year-old female patient {{sustained}} three contiguous vertebral fractures at the thoracolumbar junction while {{jumping off}} {{the third floor}} in a suicide attempt. Initial fracture treatment occurred {{in the setting of}} a multiple injury scenario. While the Th 12 and the L 1 vertebral fractures were considered stable, the L 2 fracture exhibited a complete burst configuration with 80 % canal compromise due to a posterior wall fragment causing paraplegia. A posterior pedicle screw stabilisation with indirect fracture reduction was carried out initially from T 12 to L 3. At 1 Â year follow-up the patient presented to us for new onset radiculopathy L 2, and loss of correction. A circumferential revision surgery with an expandable cage was carried out to restore the anterior and posterior columns. Unfortunately again loss of reduction with kyphosis occurred, this time at the upper instrumented vertebra, which made another revision necessary. In this situation a longer construct was chosen using a combined approach and a Mesh cage. This later procedure was complicated by a postoperative paraparesis believed to be vascular in origin. SixÂ months later a further complication involving MSSA deep wound infection required a series of irrigation debridement for healing. At the 2. 5 Â years follow up the spine was stable and the patient had a neurologic recovery allowing her to ambulate with crutches.

40|$|Congenital {{scoliosis}} {{associated with}} split cord malformation raises {{the issue on}} how to best manage these patients to avoid neurologic injury while achieving satisfactory correction. We present {{the case of a}} 12 -year-old girl who first presented when she was 11 -year old with such combination but without much physical handicap or neurological deficit. The corrective surgery offered at that time was refused by the family. She again presented after 1 Â year with documented severe aggravation of the curve resulting in unstable walking and psychological upset. Her imaging studies showed multiple malformations in lower cervical and thoracic spine and a split cord malformation type 2 (fibrous septum with diplomyelia) at the apex of the deformity. A one-stage correction was deemed neurologically too risky. We therefore performed during a first stage a thoracotomy with anterior release. This was followed by skeletal traction with skull tongs and bilateral femoral pins. After gradual increase in traction weights a reasonable correction was achieved without any neurological deficit, over the next 10 Â days. A second-stage operation was done on the 11 th day and a posterior instrumented fusion was performed. Post-operative recovery was uneventful and there were no complications. She was discharged with a Boston Brace to be worn for 3 Â months. At 2 -year follow-up the patient outcome is excellent with excellent balance and correction of the deformity. In this grand <b>round</b> <b>case,</b> we discuss all the different option of treatment of congenital scoliosis associated with split cord malformation.

Once optimal correction is achieved with the traction, a posterior instrumentation can be safely done...|$|E
40|$|Delayed {{post-traumatic}} osteonecrosis, {{also known}} by its eponym Kummellâs disease, is a rarely reported clinical entity that likely occurs with higher frequency than recognized. We highlight {{a case of a}} 75 -year-old female household ambulator who presented with significant thoracolumbar pain and delayed T 12 collapse after a ground-level fall. The patient had sustained a trivial fall at home 4 Â months prior to this presentation and had been hospitalized in our institution at that time for a general medical workup. Dedicated spine radiographs were not obtained during this visit. However, lateral chest radiograph demonstrated an intact T 12 vertebral body. The patient was able to mobilize successfully with therapy and was discharged home. During the interim between the initial fall and subsequent presentation, she resumed physical activity including ambulating independently and performing various housework. Approximately 4 Â months following her initial injury, the patient returned to a local emergency department with vague complaints of abdominal pain without any history of recent fall or injury. After an unremarkable workup, the patient was sent home. Ten days later, she represented to our institutionâs emergency room with worsening pain. Radiographs and CT scan demonstrated interval collapse of the T 12 vertebral body. A linear vacuum cleft was noted on X-rays and CT. An extensive workup to exclude other processes such as malignancy or infection, which was negative, ensued. Delayed post-traumatic vertebral collapse was diagnosed. A trial of medical management and therapy was attempted, but she continued to experience significant pain. A T 12 vertebroplasty was therefore offered and performed to stabilize the injury and to relieve the pain. She was subsequently able to be discharged from the hospital and transitioned back to home life. At approximately 2 Â years following her injury, the patient was noted to be able to ambulate with a walking aid. Her final radiograph after her surgery demonstrated that the T 12 vertebroplasty had maintained its height and sagittal alignment.
