2500|$|The art and {{animation}} of the Hunter × Hunter anime {{have also been}} commended by the press. Kimlinger and Tucker were impressed by the art direction of Hunter × Hunter, the former of whom critiquing the adaptation of Togashi's work by Furuhashi as having [...] "understated energy and flair, {{making the most of}} the era's (1999) mix of traditional and CG animation to bring Gon and friends' physical feats to fluid, exhilarating life." [...] Martin faulted both the artwork and the subtle differences in character design. [...] "The artistry not only shows its age but, in fact, looks older than it actually is," [...] the reviewer commented, [...] "hearkening back to a day when digital coloring and CG enhancements were not ubiquitous and allowances for a <b>rougher</b> <b>look</b> were greater." [...] Opinions of the series' sound and music have been somewhat mixed. Martin positively noted the soundtrack as the strongest production point of Hunter × Hunter, and was satisfied with both the English translation of the script and Ocean's voice overs. Tucker found the music satisfactory and improved as the series progressed, but did not think it lived up to its potential. Kimlinger agreeably felt the musical score to be appropriate in most instances, but criticized the English dub as [...] "a letdown since day one".|$|E

60|$|On {{the fourth}} day after leaving the camp of Tilly, as Malcolm was {{proceeding}} across a bare and desolate country he heard a sound of galloping behind him, and saw a party of six <b>rough</b> <b>looking</b> horsemen coming along the road.

60|$|It {{was a long}} walk; and I {{stepped in}} at a sort of grocery {{to get a drink}} of water, where some six or eight <b>rough</b> <b>looking</b> fellows were playing dominoes upon the counter, seated upon cheese boxes.

In this bar, looking for any sort of human affection, Lizzie shamelessly flirted with Jake, a <b>rough</b> <b>looking</b> bar fly (who bore similar style to her ex-husband Jonathan). She almost let things get too far with him, but Billy Lewis stepped in, and though she didn’t want to be saved, he saved her from herself. Thus began an awkward, yet moving friendship.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{he was not}} {{a trained}} {{professional}} painter, Gong Kai's style of painting could be described as amateur in appearance and straightforward. Some scholars believe that reason for his style was due to his appearance. He was reported as being an [...] "imposing figure," [...] very tall and with a long beard. They feel that his <b>rough</b> <b>looks</b> caused his brushwork to be coarse and added the “oddness of the images in his paintings." ...|$|R

50|$|The first {{critically}} acclaimed and famous Kurdish films were produced by Yılmaz Güney. Initially a popular, award-winning actor in Turkey with the nickname Çirkin Kral (the Ugly King, after his <b>rough</b> <b>looks),</b> {{he spent the}} later part of his career producing socio-critical and politically loaded films. Sürü (1979), Yol (1982) and Duvar (1983) are his best-known works, of which the second won Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival of 1982, the most prestigious award {{in the world of}} cinema.|$|R
60|$|On {{arriving}} at the wood the party mounted, and at once proceeded on their journey. Four days' travel took them to Malaga, where they arrived without any adventure whatever. Once or twice they met parties of <b>rough</b> <b>looking</b> men; but travelling as they did without baggage animals, they did not appear promising subjects for robbery, and the determined appearance of master and man, each armed with sword and pistols, deterred the fellows from an attempt which promised more hard knocks than plunder.|$|R

He was a secondary pitcher at Meisei {{at the same time as}} Ooyama and Sawai, never able to wear the ace number as a player. Although Sawai did gift him his jersey after he was injured.|$|R

50|$|Robot Joness {{animation}} style can {{been seen}} as a throwback to 1970s and 1980s cartoons such as Schoolhouse Rock!, with an intentionally messy and <b>rough</b> <b>look.</b> The artistic style seems to be influenced by Paul Coker and Jolly Roger Bradfield. The series animation technique is different from most American cartoons from the early 2000s; it was animated with traditional cel animation, {{at a time when many}} American cartoons had switched to digital ink and paint (possibly due to the 1980s settings). The show was animated at Rough Draft Studios at Seoul, Korea.|$|R

To prepare himself {{for the role of}} Salim in Slumdog Millionaire after being cast he hung out with some of the ‘gangsters’ in Mira Road [...] "to get into their heads". Director Danny Boyle gave him a series of the Godfather to watch as that had a crazy brother in it. Also, he had an accident which led him getting 12 stitches which helped with the <b>rough</b> <b>look,</b> he said. He had to grow his hair long, increase his skin tan and lose weight to act as Salim.|$|R
5000|$|The series' title music, [...] "Old Ned", won its {{composer}} Ron Grainer {{his second}} successive Ivor Novello award. The series had no standard set of opening titles but the opening sequences would often feature the Steptoe's horse, Hercules. [...] "Steptoe and Son" [...] is the Steptoes' trading name, but as {{established in the}} first episode, the [...] "Son" [...] is not Harold as initially believed, but Albert. The name dates from {{when he and his}} mother—Mrs. Steptoe—worked the rounds. The first series has the pair as very <b>rough</b> <b>looking</b> and often dirty and wearing ragged clothes, but they quickly [...] "tidied up" [...] for later series.|$|R

Rough eyed the strange being's approach with suspicion, and going to her mistress placed herself at her side. The man came up and sat down at a distance of three or four yards from the group, and <b>Rough,</b> <b>looking</b> dangerous, started up and put her forepaws on her mistress's lap and began uttering a low growl.|$|R

It was shot by photographer Joe Lyons at his first photo studio in north London, and he described how he had set up the shot: [...] "I'd just shot some furniture for a furniture designer, and got paid with the furniture. I chose dummies and started work—a fortuitous series of events. I felt that the hi-tech furniture worked really well with the <b>rough</b> <b>look</b> of the room, and I put the cake—which was actually the top of my wedding cake—as a focus on the table." ...|$|R
5000|$|On August 15th, the Chinese Film and Television Critics Association Board held a {{forum to}} discuss the drama, what it did well and how it could improve if they go ahead with a second season. A lot of the critics had praises for {{the theme of the}} drama and having an {{independent}} strong female character. Some criticism on the series were its bright lighting, and how the characters were too good <b>looking</b> and not <b>rough</b> <b>looking</b> enough to reflect the time period depicted. Ma Zhongjun, Ciwen Media's CEO, said that Princess Agents ended up with better ratings that they expected. Princess Agents is the second most successful weekly drama of all time and the most successful one in a late time-slot.|$|R

60|$|The man was {{apparently}} {{fifty years of}} age, and <b>rough</b> in <b>looks.</b> His beard was long, as was also his hair, and both seemed to be much in need of shears and brush. His clothing and his face were dirty, and altogether he presented a decidedly ill-favored appearance.|$|R
50|$|Portrait of a Man with Carnation {{is a small}} oil on oakwood {{painting}} usually {{attributed to}} the Early Netherlandish master Jan van Eyck, {{or a member of}} his workshop. Based on dendrochronological examination of the wood, it is thought to have been completed relatively late in van Eycks career, perhaps around 1436. It is now in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin. The sitter wears a large grey fur lined hat, and grey clothes, fur lined at the neck. holds a small bunch of carnations, symbols of marriage. He has not been identified, but wears the medal of the Order of Saint Anthony, established by Albert I, Duke of Bavaria. The man is older, probably in his early 50s, and has a coarse, <b>rough</b> <b>look,</b> which the artist does not shy from depicting.|$|R

Rectus and I were carried below, too, and three or four <b>rough</b> <b>looking</b> fellows, who didn't speak a word that we could understand, set to work at us and took off our clothes, and rubbed us with warm stuff, and gave us some hot tea and gruel, and I don't know what else, and put us into hammocks, and stuffed blankets around us, and made me feel warmer, and happier, and more grateful and sleepy than I thought it was in me to feel. I expect Rectus felt the same. In about five minutes, I was fast asleep.|$|R
