A small flock of Greenland white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons flavirostris) from the world population of approximately 12,000 migrates to winter on boglands in the Killarney Valley within the park.

25|$|In {{response}} to the public alarm over fallout, an {{effort was made to}} design a clean multi-megaton weapon, relying almost entirely on fusion. The energy produced by the fissioning of unenriched natural uranium, when used as the tamper material in the secondary and subsequent stages in the Teller-Ulam design, can evidently dwarf the fusion yield output, {{as was the case in}} the Castle Bravo test; realizing that a non-fissionable tamper material is an essential requirement in a 'clean' bomb, it is clear that in such a bomb there will be a relatively massive amount of material that does not contribute energy by either fission or fusion. So for a given weight, 'dirty' weapons with fissionable tampers are much more powerful than a 'clean' weapon (or, for an equal yield, they are much lighter). The earliest known incidence of a three-stage device being tested, with the third stage, called the tertiary, being ignited by the secondary, was May 27, 1956 in the Bassoon device. This device was tested in the Zuni shot of Operation <b>Redwing.</b> This shot used non fissionable tampers; an inert substitute material such as tungsten or lead was used. Its yield was 3.5 megatons, 85% fusion and only 15% fission.|$|E

Penney cancelled the Green Granite test and substituted a new weapon codenamed Purple Granite.

Despite its failure, the test was hailed as a successful thermonuclear explosion, and the government did not confirm or deny reports that the UK had become a third thermonuclear power. When documents on the series began to be declassified in the 1990s, they were denounced as a hoax. The reports were unlikely to have fooled the American observers.|$|E
500|$|Lawyers for The Progressive filed {{a motion}} to vacate the {{decision}} {{on the grounds that}} the information contained in Morland's article was already in the public domain.

One of them, UCRL-4725, gave details about Bassoon, a three-stage thermonuclear device tested during Operation <b>Redwing</b> in 1956. It was found on the shelves of the Los Alamos library by Dmitri Rotow, a researcher for the American Civil Liberties Union. According to the government, the reports had been inadvertently declassified. On June 15, in 486 F. Supp. 5 (W.D. Wis. 1979), Warren therefore denied the motion on the grounds that such an error did not place the documents in the public domain. The appellants, in [...] 610 F. 2d 819 (7th Cir. 1979), immediately appealed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, claiming that the two documents had been on the shelves for a considerable period of time. The government now advanced the argument that [...] "technical data" [...] was not protected by the First Amendment.
