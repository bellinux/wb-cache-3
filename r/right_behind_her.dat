2500|$|Utamaro {{achieves}} a strong compositional balance despite the painting's complexity. [...] He distributes 27 figures throughout it amongst several buildings, {{such as a}} teahouse duplexes and a second-storey restaurant-teahouse at the left. [...] The main building {{appears to be a}} two-story restaurant-teahouse; the picture focuses on an atrium with a garden court in the middle surrounded by railings, revealing the snowy outdoors. [...] With the exception of the young boy who reaches out at a cat in the lower left, all the figures are women, though in real life the guests of a pleasure house would be men. [...] Several of the figures pose {{in a manner similar to}} those in the book Seirō Ehon Nenjū Gyōji (1804) that Utamaro illustrated around the time he completed this painting, such as the woman looking behind her in the hallway in the centre, the woman with her arm wrapped around a pillar in the centre, and the woman crouched down near her with her hand on the railing, looking to the <b>right</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E

"Now," [...] he began, [...] "a boat or a ship under sail can go {{straight}} to the place she's bound {{for as long as she}} has the wind anywhere from <b>right</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> to a little forward on her side. In fact, as she'll lie up within a few points of the wind, there's only a small segment of the circle you can't sail her straight into." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mary Anne {{immediately}} hooked <b>her</b> <b>right</b> arm <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> in {{her left}} hand--an attitude absolutely necessary to the situation--and replied: 'One is indicative mood, present tense, third person singular, verb active to say. Other is indicative mood, present tense, third person plural, verb active to say.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, {{the woman}} leans to her left, and places her weight {{on her left}} knee. This allows her to {{straighten}} out <b>her</b> lifted <b>right</b> leg <b>behind</b> <b>her,</b> placing it inside her partner's bent left leg.

5000|$|Courtesy Turn : The gentleman {{takes the}} lady's left {{hand in his}} left hand, and puts his <b>right</b> hand <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> back to take her right hand (usually at {{the small of her}} back).

60|$|In fact <b>right</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> Gabriel {{could be}} seen {{piloting}} Freddy Malins across the landing. The latter, a young man of about forty, was of Gabriel's size and build, with very round shoulders. His face was fleshy and pallid, touched with colour only at the thick hanging lobes of his ears and at the wide wings of his nose. He had coarse features, a blunt nose, a convex and receding brow, tumid and protruded lips. His heavy-lidded eyes and the disorder of his scanty hair made him look sleepy. He was laughing heartily in a high key at a story {{which he had been}} telling Gabriel on the stairs {{and at the same time}} rubbing the knuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left eye.|$|E

The follower then turns {{in the opposite direction}} while unrolling her arm, and the couple end up facing each other.|$|R
