5|$|Jain texts mention five transgressions (Atichara) of the vow: {{the desire}} to be reborn as a human, {{the desire to}} be reborn as a divinity, the desire to {{continue}} living, the desire to die quickly, and the desire to live a sensual life in the next life. Other transgressions include: recollection of affection for friends, <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pleasures enjoyed, and longing for the enjoyment of pleasures in the future.|$|E
5|$|Despite her {{relative}} inexperience, Leigh {{was chosen}} to play Ophelia to Olivier's Hamlet in an Old Vic Theatre production staged at Elsinore, Denmark. Olivier later recalled an incident when her mood rapidly changed as she was preparing to go onstage. Without apparent provocation, she began screaming at him before suddenly becoming silent and staring into space. She was able to perform without mishap, and by the following day she had returned to normal with no <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event. It {{was the first time}} Olivier witnessed such behaviour from her. They began living together, as their respective spouses had each refused to grant either of them a divorce. Under the moral standards then enforced by the film industry, their relationship had to be kept from public view.|$|E
5|$|Patton was {{regarded}} as more moderate than most coal operators in his relationship to labor unions. Most of his mine workers were not unionized, {{and those who were}} generally belonged to the Southern Labor Union rather than the more confrontational United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). Members of the UMWA local at Shelby Gap maintained that Patton was arrested for clipping a striking miner on a picket line with his pickup truck in the late 1970s. Local law enforcement officials claim no <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incident, and there is no record of an arrest warrant against Patton or an actual arrest.|$|E

5|$|Remember Me {{features}} platforming, {{exploration and}} melee combat. The {{game is played}} as Nilin from a third-person view and introduces the mechanic of memory remixing: entering and rearranging a target's memories to manipulate them. Players accomplish this by replaying a memory and modifying details to change the target's <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outcome. Another key mechanic of the gameplay is stealing memories from certain targets and using points called Remembranes to replay the memory in real-time: this is often needed to proceed through the game or avoid hazards otherwise hidden from the player. When the player is low on health, the screen will glitch until a sufficient amount of health is regained. On occasion, Nilin encounters puzzles {{in the form of}} riddles she must solve to unlock doors so as to further progress in the story.|$|E
5|$|Scully cuts {{her hand}} on the thorn of a twig left in her car. When she drives off, a veve is seen on the ground under her car. Mulder has a meeting with X, who tells him that he and Scully will soon be called back to Washington and that the camp will be {{restricted}} to military personnel only. Mulder believes Wharton is persecuting the refugees after the suicide of some of his men during a previous trip to Haiti. Scully finds Dunham dead in a bathtub, and Mulder catches McAlpin with a knife nearby. Although he has no <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event, McAlpin confesses to the murder under the influence of Wharton, who tells the agents that Bauvais committed suicide and that their investigation is over.|$|E
5|$|The {{religious}} movement {{believes in}} a moral progression through reincarnation after death: the transmigration {{of the spirit}} in a human body only reflects the degree of spiritual elevation. The reincarnated person has no <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past lives, and can again make progress in his spiritual course that allows him, at the end, to reach the divine state which releases him from the cycle of reincarnation. The harm caused by disease and by people is seen as a beneficial cure, as the pain can increase one's spiritual progress and thus contribute to one's salvation. The silent prayer is also considered as a way to connect the spirit to consciousness. Antoine, who suffered from disease and demonstrated asceticism and dedication throughout his life, is regarded by followers as a role model to attain salvation.|$|E

5|$|After her {{sentencing}} Green {{continued to}} maintain that her recall of {{the night of the}} fire was limited. In the summer of 1996, she wrote to her daughter claiming that she had taken more than the recommended doses of her medications that night. Similar letters to Michael Farrar varied from claims that she had no <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night to firmly stating that she was innocent of the arson. She theorized that Margaret Hacker had set fire to the family's house, and reiterated her claim from the show-cause hearing that Tim had been the one to poison his father. Green wrote to author Ann Rule in 1996 asserting that, due to alcohol abuse, she had not had the mental capacity to start a fire. In a later interview with Rule, she blamed her cloudy thinking during the court hearings on her Prozac prescription, and stated that once she was off the drug, her mind became much clearer.|$|E
25|$|Of all the {{destruction}} in Jaffna city, it was {{the destruction}} of the Jaffna Public Library that was the incident which appeared to cause the most distress to the people of Jaffna.

25|$|Although Zhang was {{credited}} by the PLAAF for shooting down Davis' F-86, {{doubts about the}} claim were raised due to US Air Force's <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event was inconsistent with Zhang's own account of the battle, and that Davis had claimed to have shot down two Chinese MiGs moments before being killed. The lack of gun camera footage from Chinese side meant Zhang's victory claim also hinged on his own <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event. After declassifying their involvement in the Korean War 40 years later, Russian sources disputed Zhang's claim by raising the possibility that 1st Lieutenant Mikhail Akimovich Averin was the MiG pilot that had shot down Davis' plane. According to the recollections from the pilots of the Soviet 64th Aviation Corps, both Zhang and his wingman were probably shot down by Davis, who was in turn surprised and shot down by Mikhail A. Averin scrambling to save the Chinese MiGs. Lieutenant General Georgeii Lobov, commander of the 64th Aviation Corps, also noted in his memoir that Davis {{was killed by a}} Soviet pilot. Currently, both China and Russia have taken credit over Davis' death with no conclusive evidence to confirm either sides of the story.|$|E
25|$|Sleep also {{influences}} language development. To test this, researchers taught infants a faux {{language and}} observed their <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rules for that language. Infants who slept within {{four hours of}} learning the language could remember the language rules better, while infants who stayed awake longer did not recall those rules as well. There is also a relationship between infants' vocabulary and sleeping: infants who sleep longer at night at 12 months have better vocabularies at 26 months.|$|E

25|$|Pintarić was {{suspicious}} towards his wife, believing {{that she was}} helping the police to capture or even kill him.

25|$|Gilovich {{offers two}} {{different}} explanations for why people believe hot hands exist. The {{first is that}} a person may be biased towards looking for streaks before watching a basketball game. This bias would then affect their perceptions and <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game (confirmation bias). The second explanation deals with people’s inability to recognize chance sequences. People expect chance sequences to alternate between the options more than they actually do. Chance sequences can seem too lumpy, and are thus dismissed as non-chance (clustering illusion).|$|E
25|$|During the film's production, Argento became {{stricken}} {{with a severe}} case of hepatitis---and had to direct some sequences while lying on his back. At one point, the illness became so painful that he was bedridden for a few days; filming was then restricted to second unit work, some of which was done by Mario Bava. Argento has called Inferno one of his least favorite of all his films...as his memories of the movie are tainted by his <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> painful illness he suffered.|$|E

A typical example of this is doctor's notes in relation to an injured person, which is then adduced as medical evidence in a criminal trial.

25|$|In {{the real}} world, {{the crew of}} the Nebuchadnezzar and the Hammer find and reactivate Niobe's ship, the Logos. They {{interrogate}} Bane, who says that he has no <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier massacre. As the captains plan their defense of Zion, Neo requests a ship to travel to the Machine City. Motivated by her encounter with the Oracle, Niobe offers him the Logos. Neo departs, accompanied by Trinity. Bane, who has stowed away on the Logos, takes Trinity hostage. Neo realizes that Bane has been assimilated by Smith and a fight ensues. Bane cauterizes Neo's eyes with a power cable, blinding him; however, Neo discovers an ability to perceive the world as golden light. Neo kills Bane, and Trinity pilots them to the Machine City.|$|E
25|$|On May 27, 1995, Reeve's horse made a refusal. Witnesses {{said that}} the horse began the third fence jump and {{suddenly}} stopped. Reeve fell forward off the horse, {{holding on to the}} reins. His hands somehow became tangled in the reins, and the bridle and bit were pulled off the horse. He landed head first {{on the far side of}} the fence, shattering his first and second vertebrae. This cervical spinal injury, which paralyzed him from the neck down, also halted his breathing. Paramedics arrived three minutes later and immediately took measures to get air into his lungs. He was taken first to the local hospital, before being flown by helicopter to the University of Virginia Medical Center. Afterwards, he had no <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accident. Due to this injury, Armand Assante replaced Reeve for the role of Alan Breck Stewart in Kidnapped.|$|E
