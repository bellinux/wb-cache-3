40|$|The {{status of}} {{fisheries}} and seasonal variation in fish {{diversity in the}} Kodungallur-Azhikode Estuary (KAE) were investigated. Total annual average fish production in the estuary declined significantly to 908. 6 t with average yield of 5. 4 kg ha- 1 day- 1, when compared to earlier study; where 2747 t was reported. During the present study, 60 species of finfishes (belonging to 34 finfish families), 6 species of penaeid shrimps, 2 species of palaemonid prawns, 2 species of crabs (4 crustacean families), 6 species of bivalves (3 molluscan families) were noticed. Finfishes were the major group that contributed 69. 62 % of total fishery in the estuary and crustaceans (23. 47 %), bivalves (6. 84 %) and oysters (0. 07 %) also formed good fishery. Many of the fish species in the estuary were observed as threatened (Horabagrus brachysoma, Channa striatus, Channa marulius, Clarias batrachus, Heteropneustes fossilis and Wallago attu). The major fishing gears employed in the estuary were gillnets, cast nets, stake <b>nets,</b> scoop <b>nets,</b> <b>ring</b> <b>nets,</b> traps and Chinese dip nets. Gillnets contributed 45 % of the total fish catch. Gillnets also showed highest catch per unit effort (CPUE) of 6. 91 kg h- 1 followed by cast nets (1. 85 kg h- 1), Chinese dip nets (3. 20 kg h- 1), stake nets (3. 05 kg h- 1), <b>ring</b> <b>nets</b> (1. 27 kg h- 1), hooks and lines (1. 35 kg h- 1) and scoop nets (0. 92 kg h- 1).

40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to study {{skipjack}} (Katsuwonus pelamis) live bait availability and other small pelagic fish, their seasonal variations with respect to distribution, species and size composition. Exploratory surveys made use of echo sounding and lookout during the day, and light attraction at night. Percentage composition of spp caught at each station is tabulated. Seasonal variations are discussed and monthly variations in some important groups are plotted. Size composition, especially for Sardinella spp, is considered. The availability of 'red bait' would not be adequate to support an extended pole and line fishery for skipjack. The daytime fishing methods were not considered to have been especially successful, and the choice of gear and method of capture is discussed.

In the experiments, the display of a non-intrusive stereo imaging measurement of the three-dimensional net geometry was established by tracing the positions of the LED markers on the cage net. A 1 / 30 -scale model of a net cage was used composing of top and bottom hoops (or <b>rings),</b> <b>nets,</b> four buoys and four anchor blocks moored to the tank bottom. Trinocular stereo imaging, which used three synchronized video cameras to follow the three-dimensional displacements of 37 Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) attached to the net, was em-ployed to monitor the deformation and motion of the fish net. The motion of the collar and bottom hoop under different current velocities was also observed and is discussed in this paper. This measurement method offers more convenience and detail about deformation and motion investigation of a flexible net structure...|$|R
50|$|Mkwiro is {{primarily}} a subsistence fishing village that utilizes several methods to catch fish: spear fishing, <b>ring</b> <b>net</b> fishing, line fishing, trap and aquarium fishing {{are among the most}} common ways in which local fisherman will catch fish in the area.

Turtle by-catching whilst fishing is also a problem, as 5 out of the world's 7 species of turtles have been spotted in and around Wasini Channel.Mkwiro also benefits from seaweed farming. Dried seaweed is often exported to Asian markets. Priced at about 15 shillings per kilo of dried seaweed, Mkwiro villagers work very hard for a very low commission.

50|$|Fishing is an {{important}} activity in the Pasaleng Bay. The three coastal barangays where fishing is carried out are the Balao-i, Pancian and Pasaleng. It is a municipal fishing ground where 169 fishing boats operate in the bay under 91 fishing units. Most of the boats are in the capacity range of below 3 GT. There are 457 fishing gears (operated by 482 fishermen) under 16 types which operate in the bay and which are of hook and line type {{to the extent of}} 75%. From 2000 to 2006 under the National Stock Assessment Project (NSAP), 319 fish species were caught including marine organisms. They belonged to 59 families. Species of Demersal species dominated the catch with 64% of the total catch; the pelagic species contributed the rest. It consisted of 30 families of fish, 3 families of shark/rays, and 6 families of invertebrates. Specific species caught were squids, lobsters, crabs and Ranina ranina, the red frog crab. The dominant families in the order of the species that they represent are Carangidae (32 species), Serranidae (28 species), Lutjanidae (26 species), Nemipteridae (18 species), Scombridae (17 species fol owed by other families each having 15 species. The pelagic species were the most dominant in terms of catch and these in the order of their importance are Katsuwonus pelamis (skipjack), Selar crumenopthalmus and Auxis thazard. Among the various gears used for fishing the maximum yield was from Baby <b>ring</b> <b>net,</b> while the maximum number of species caught is credited to speargun.|$|E

40|$|The Wexford {{sea bass}} fishery is {{operated}} during most {{months of the}} year with a high season from May to October. The fishery commenced in the 1950 s but has shown a decline from the first years in which statistics became available. A proportion of the commercial catch comes from stake and <b>ring</b> <b>nets</b> with a mesh size of 18. 4 cm in the round. Both take fish of similar fork length. Bass of 30 - 43 cm were the majority of those retained and they were mainly immatures. The smallest mature female examined in 1978 was a 6 + of 36. 5 cm fork length. The greater part of the commercial catch is taken by line. Some details of the biology of bass in south east Ireland in 1978 are given: the fish fed mainly on shore crabs, sand shrimps and bait fishes. Sex ratios were approximately two females to each male. Growth in the mid 1970 s differed little from other decades and it is concluded that bass in Irish waters conform to a single growth curve which is temporarily altered by good or bad growing years.

40|$|The {{following}} two reports, on {{the sizes of}} sardines taken by various kinds of fishing gear and caught in {{different areas of the}} Monterey and of the San Pedro fishing regions, present the results of an investigation made {{to determine whether or not}} the system of sardine sampling as carried on in the past is still adequate since changes have occurred in the fishery. The results are of importance to the industry because they show that lampara, purse seine and <b>ring</b> <b>nets</b> all take the same sizes of fish, that these sizes comprise the sardines available to the fishermen, and that no type of gear exhibits size selection differing from any other type. of greater importance to the industry is the evidence indicating that large fish first appear each winter to the north of Monterey and gradually become disseminated southward throughout the entire Monterey region, whereas in the San Pedro region no consistent distribution of differential sizes within the region is evident. The results are of value to the sardine investigation because of the demonstration of the continual reliability of our sardine sampling system and the furnishing of additional evidence indicating a southward movement of sardines along the California coast during the winter months...|$|R

25|$|The {{yellowstripe scad}} is an {{important}} species for commercial and subsistence fisheries throughout its range. Between 1990 and 2010 the FAO reported worldwide catch has ranged between 113,000 and 195,000 t, with a consistent trend towards higher catches. These statistics only include Indonesia, Malaysia and the UAE, suggesting true catch sizes to be higher. Of the countries that report catches to the FAO, Indonesia takes the highest amount, with between 129,000 t and 180,000 t reported each year between 2000 and 2010. Locally yellowstripe scad make up {{a high percentage of}} the catch; in an Indian example, it accounted for up to 36% of total landings in one survey. However, in India overall, yellowstripe scad makes up only 1.5% of total carangid catches. The species is predominantly taken in trawls, however is also caught by gill net, bag net, purse seines or <b>ring</b> <b>nets,</b> and push nets. The species is most abundant during spawning periods in India and consists of 8–13cm individuals. A study on the population dynamics in an Indian fishery during 1994 found there was low fishing pressure on the stocks, however a later assessment found stocks elsewhere in India to be overexploited. The novel use of hydroacoustic sounding to estimate the school size of yellowstripe scad, as well as other scad species, has been trialled with varying levels of effectiveness.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} The <b>Ring</b> <b>Net,</b> a documentary exhibition {{by the artist}} Will Maclean. The <b>Ring</b> <b>Net</b> {{is a collection of}} drawings, photographs and printed plans numbering more than three hundred and forty items, which was originally shown at the 'Third Eye Centre, Glasgow in 1978. It subsequently toured to various venues, mostly in Scotland, and was later bought by The Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh where it is presently held. The project is based on a particular method of sea fishing which used to be practised on the West Coast of Scotland. The subject of fishing is a consistent feature in the work of Maclean, although this particular undertaking is somewhat unusual as the artist has chosen a documentary approach. The initial period of research for the project was enabled by an Edinburgh-based charitable organisation, the Scottish International Education Trust. The artist continued to work on the project for some time afterwards, and the eventual exhibition was not shown until {{four and a half years}} later. The aim of this dissertation is to look at The <b>Ring</b> <b>Net</b> in its context. The period of its making is explored in some depth, as is the showing of the project at the Third Eye Centre and the various venues included in its tour.

40|$|Fisheries for {{grey mullet}} are {{widespread}} {{on the south}} coast of Ireland, the majority being small and irregularly operated. The largest, at Wexford in the south-east, is a summer fishery where recent catches are well documented. At Wexford nets of mesh perimeter 18. 4 cm are fished as fixed engines by two methods known locally as stake and <b>ring</b> <b>nets.</b> The fish are captured by wedging in a single mesh. Data from the stake nets give an indication of catch per unit effort and this has shown no significant variation from 1969 to 1977. From June to September 1977 fork length and girth measurements were made from 2, 121 net-captured grey mullet; age and weight were determined for 528 of these. Gonads from 341 fish were weighed and 154 ovaries were sectioned. The majority of net-caught fish were between 31 and 45 cm fork length and 8 to 12 years of age. As the season progressed the gonads of maturing males expanded up to 700 % by weight. Growth of the ovary was variable and smaller in degree. Ovary weight in autumn correlated well with mean oocyte diameter. On the basis of previously reported growth data for grey mullet in British and Irish waters and {{on the length of}} fish retained by the nets a mean age of catch of 9. 6 years is expected.

2500|$|There are {{two major}} {{fisheries}} in operation for yellowfin whiting; one in the Gulfs of South Australia and another in Shark Bay, Western Australia. There are also up to four minor fisheries in Western Australia, centered in the Blackwood River estuary, Geographe Bay, the Leschenault Estuary and Cockburn Sound. Fishing methods employed commonly include beach seines, bottom set gill nets along creek edges, <b>ring</b> <b>nets,</b> and long gill nets set on sand banks. Nets are usually set in the mornings in South Australia, when fish often move from the tidal flats back into the deeper channels. The two major fishery areas have produced very large numbers of fish in the past, with the South Australian catch representing [...] up to 65% of the [...] entire catch from the gulfs in the late 1970s. In Shark Bay, the largest known annual catch was 204 tonnes during 1961. This has dropped substantially, and current Shark Bay catches have fluctuated between 100 and 130 tonnes per year since 1990, with the 2003 catch around 110 tonnes. Including the minor fisheries catches of Western Australia, the total WA yellowfin whiting catch was 131.4 tonnes, and made up over 95% of the total whiting catch in the state. South Australia has similar modern catch numbers, with the fishery recovering from a major downturn in the late 1980s, when the catch dropped below 20 tonnes per year for an unknown reason. Concerns were raised about previous over-exploitation, but catch numbers have since recovered to levels of around 150–170 tonnes per year.|$|R
