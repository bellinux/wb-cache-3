40|$|Head-related impulse {{responses}} (HRIRs) are subject-dependent and direction-dependent filters used in spatial audio synthesis. They {{describe the}} scattering {{response of the}} head, torso, and pinnae of the subject. We propose a structural factorization of the HRIRs into a product of non-negative and Toeplitz matrices; the factorization {{is based on a}} novel extension of a non-negative matrix factorization algorithm. As a result, the HRIR becomes expressible as a convolution between a direction-independent resonance filter and a direction-dependent <b>reflection</b> <b>filter.</b> Further, the <b>reflection</b> <b>filter</b> can be made sparse with minimal HRIR distortion.

A tunable high-performance dye laser with similar to 0. 15 cm(- 1) line width and a beam analyzing system consisting of three simultaneously controlled CCD cameras {{were used to}} investigate grating waveguide resonances at wavelengths in the 694 nm and 633 nm ranges.

40|$|We {{present in}} this paper a {{theoretical}} study of the angular dependence of phase-conjugate emission via resonant degenerate four-wave mixing (FWM) in Doppler-broadened gas media. The nonlinear optical polarization is calculated through {{an expansion of the}} atomic density matrix up to the third order in the incident fields. One finds that, when the incident frequency is resonant for a single-photon transition, both strength and lineshape of the phase-conjugate emission strongly depend on the angle 0 between standing pump wave and probe wave. The emission intensity, maximum at grazing incidences, decreases rapidly by several orders of magnitude when 0 increases. Simultaneously the emission linewidth increases from homogeneous to Doppler width. Similar effects are predicted for nearly-degenerate FWM (different pump and probe frequencies). In particular, one shows that the bandwidth of the equivalent optical <b>reflection</b> <b>filter</b> undergoes a Doppler-broadening linearly increasing with sin θ.

40|$|The {{investigation}} into {{three types of}} dielectric resonators for use in base-station filtering applications is presented. The triple-mode cubic TE 016 resonator is shown to have good performance for high Q applications. Its suitability for realising conventional narrowband selective bandpass filter responses is proved. The effect on the response of spurious intercavity couplings through irises is studied. The triple-mode cubic TE 016 resonator is also used for the realisation of a novel type of filter, the even-odd hybrid mode <b>reflection</b> <b>filter,</b> which {{eliminates the need for}} cross-couplings for any symmetrical frequency response. The insensitivity of the new type of filter to most spurious couplings is shown {{in the case of a}} sixth degree elliptic filter. The drawbacks of this type of filter are also described. The new dual-mode conductor-loaded dielectric resonator is presented. An exact model of the resonator is necessary for an accurate study of this resonator. The axial mode-matching technique is used. The relative numbers of modes to use in each section of the model for optimum convergence primarily depend on the mode type and the relative diameters of the dielectric cylinder and the metal disc. The convergence of the resonant frequencies is good. That of the quality factors is slower but still provide useful approximate results. These convergences are affected respectively by large electric and magnetic field amplitudes in singularity regions. The resonant frequency and Q. of the fundamental mode are primarily dependent on the diameter and height of the dielectric cylinder respectively. The resonator geometry is optimised for Qu and spurious separation at 900 MHz and trade-offs between the two criteria are quantified. The resonator is found to be particularly suited for medium Q applications, i. e. between 4000 and 7000. The third resonator, the dielectric-loaded TEO,, resonator, is shown to be well suited for applications around 2 GHz and requiring Qu's of a few thousands. Theoptimum cavity cross-section dimensions for maximum Qu volume are almost constant over a wide range of cavity diameters. The trade-off between Qu and spurious separation is explained. Coupling bandwidth limitations in the case of off-line cavities are found to be solvable by using off-centred resonators. 80 MHz wide filters, optimised for ease of manufacturing, are built.

40|$|M. Ing. This work {{comprises}} the implementation and comparison of five design techniques {{for the design}} of gradient-index thin film optical filters: classical rugate, inverse Fourier transform, a wavelet-based design procedure, as well as the flip-flop and the genetic optimization techniques. Designs for a high-reflectance filter, a beamsplitter, a discrete level filter, a distributed filter, and an anti-reflection coating were used to compare the various filter synthesis techniques. The optical thickness of the various examples was maintained below 30 and the refractive index excursion limits were between 1. 5 and 3. 2. The overall performance of a specific design was evaluated by a weighted merit function. The classical rugate filter uses a sinusoidal refractive index modulation that produces a single reflection band. More complex filters are realized by linear superposition of these elementary profiles. Sidelobe and ripple suppression are obtained by applying quintic windowing functions to the refractive index profile and adding matching layers {{at the edges of the}} filter. This filter design procedure has the best figure of merit of 3. 73 for the discrete level filter, and the second best of 3. 09 for the high-reflectance filter. The inverse Fourier transform links the refractive index profile and reflection spectrum of an optical filter by an approximate relation. It is self-correcting and iterative in nature. It produces filters with the highest optical density. The procedure excels in the design of the distributed filter with a figure of merit of 4. 17. Mortlett's wavelet is used as the basis of the wavelet design technique. A single wavelet yields a single reflection band, similar to the classical rugate filter. Sidelobe suppression is an inherent property of the method, but matching layers are needed for passband ripple suppression. The optical density of the high <b>reflection</b> <b>filter</b> is larger for a filter designed with this method than for the equivalent classical rugate filter. The figure of merit of 1. 75 for the high-reflectance filter is the best for any of the designs. Flip-flop refinement is a brute force approach to filter design. The layers of a starting design are flipped between two values of refractive index, the change in figure of merit evaluated and the best case saved. This process is repeated for a fixed number of iterations. It is computationally intensive and lacks ripple suppression characteristics. The flip-flop method does not compare well with any of the other techniques. It yields filters with the worst figures of merit for most of the design examples. However, it was applied successfully to the anti-reflection coating. The peak ripple for the anti-reflection filter in the 400 nm to 1100 nm wavelength band is 9. 62 % compared to the inverse Fourier transform's 57. 30 %. The genetic algorithm operates on the principle of "survival of the fittest". It is a stochastic procedure and yields quasi-random refractive index profiles. It excels with the antireflection coating. The peak ripple in the passband of the anti-reflection coating is 3. 29 %. The figure of merit for the anti-reflection coating designed with the genetic algorithm is 2. 09...|$|E
