In the west the last red glow of sunset still lingered on the steely sky, and over against it the great moon rose above the <b>round</b> <b>edge</b> of the world.

60|$|Then they pressed {{their horses}} to a canter and rode on, {{speaking}} little, for the fount of words {{seemed to be}} frozen in them, although Richard recollected, with a curious sense of wonder how he had looked forward to this opportunity of long, unfettered talk with Rachel {{and how much he}} had to tell her. Over hill and valley, through bush and stream they rode, till at last with the short twilight they reached the plain that ran to Ramah. Then came the dark in which they must ride slowly, till presently the <b>round</b> <b>edge</b> of the moon pushed itself up above the shoulder of a hill and there was light again--pure, peaceful light that turned the veld to silver and shone whitely on the pale face of Rachel.|$|E
60|$|He unstrapped {{the machine}} from his wrist {{to examine it}} better, and while holding it {{carelessly}} in his hand it slipped and fell with a bang to the deck, striking upon its <b>round</b> <b>edge</b> and rolling quickly past the cabin and out of sight. With a cry of alarm he ran after it, and after much search found it lying against the bulwark {{near the edge of}} a scupper hole, where the least jar of the ship would have sent it {{to the bottom of the}} ocean. Rob hastily seized his treasure and upon examining it found the fall had bulged the rim so that the old dents scarcely showed at all. But its original shape was more distorted than ever, and Rob feared he had utterly ruined its delicate mechanism. Should this prove to be true, he might now consider himself a prisoner of this piratical band, the members of which, although temporarily disabled, would soon regain consciousness.|$|E

60|$|Think--While {{the steam}} and stones are being blown out, the crater {{is an open}} funnel, with more or less upright walls inside. As the steam grows weaker, fewer and fewer stones fall outside, {{and more and more}} fall back again inside. At last they quite choke up the bottom of the great round hole. Perhaps, too, the lava or melted rock {{underneath}} cools and grows hard, and that chokes up the hole lower down. Then, down from the <b>round</b> <b>edge</b> of the crater the stones and cinders roll inward more and more. The rains wash them down, the wind blows them down. They roll to the middle, and meet each other, and stop. And so gradually the steep funnel becomes a round cup. You may prove for yourself that it must be so, if you will try. Do you not know that if you dig a round hole in the ground, and leave it to crumble in, it is sure to become cup-shaped at last, though at first its sides may have been quite upright, like those of a bucket? If you do not know, get a trowel and make your little experiment.|$|E

50|$|Now, if one {{positions}} {{the snap}} ring with its flat side {{such that it}} is pushed into the <b>rounded</b> <b>edge</b> of the snap ring groove when load or force is applied, the flat and square edge of the snap ring will “bite” into the <b>rounded</b> <b>edge</b> of the retaining groove and as more force is applied the snap ring will distort as it rides up the <b>rounded</b> <b>edge.</b> This distortion will spread an external snap ring or compress an internal snap ring, leaving it prone to possibly being forced from the groove and releasing the part {{it is designed to}} hold.See the accompanying pictures as to how this works and how to properly orient the snap ring in the groove.|$|R

50|$|Hall's babbler is {{the species}} most often {{confused}} with the white-browed babbler because of their similarity in size, the two can best be distinguished by comparing the supercilium. Hall’s babbler has a narrow and very dark brown crown-stripe with a much broader, vivid white supercilium. Secondly, Hall’s babbler {{does not have a}} ‘fading’ eye-stripe towards the rear of the head where there is more chestnut brown colouration. Individuals will have vivid colouration on the face and will never have a white dot under the eye which is sometimes present in the white-browed babbler. The tail will also have a square edge rather than a <b>round</b> <b>edge</b> which the white-browed babbler would have, however this feature is sometimes not as reliable in juvenile individuals.|$|E
50|$|The French {{government}} {{received two}} Type Es, {{the first in}} September 1912 and the second a month later. Two more were built but proved hard to sell, probably because the superior Caudron Type G was becoming available. A Chinese order for Type Es was changed in favour of the newer type. One was sold to the Royal Navy though its acceptance was delayed until 29 June 1914 whilst modifications were made. The fate of he fourth and final Type E is uncertain, though it may have replaced the first French government machine after its loss in May 1913. If so, it had been modernized with the pointed, <b>round</b> <b>edge</b> form introduced on the Type F and used on all the G types.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{there is}} rising demand of {{electronic}} systems with functional density for industrial and automotive applications. Those components, which are typically manufactured by overmoulding blanked metal inserts within an assembly injection process, are often exposed to rough operating conditions. Especially penetrating water {{can lead to}} a severe damage of electronic systems which are often crucial to safety. Leakage can be caused among other things by crack initiation within the polymer at sharp edges of the metal insert as a consequence of stress concentration. In order to reduce stress concentration the effect of metal inserts with <b>rounded</b> <b>edges</b> and the forming process to manufacture such inserts is investigated. Since typical sheet thicknesses for electronic components are 1 [*]mm and less the dimensions of the <b>rounded</b> <b>edges</b> are on the scale of micro features. The microforming operation of <b>rounded</b> <b>edges</b> is provided by open coining. The influence of varying part dimensions is investigated using FE-simulation. Furthermore, ideal rectangular insert shapes are compared to parts with sheared edge geometry. In addition the effect of <b>rounded</b> <b>edges</b> on stress distribution of overmoulded parts is analysed by combining resulting geometries of the forming simulation with the numerical analysis of stress distribution within the polymer...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: High speed {{machining}} (HSM) may produces {{parts with}} substantially higher fatigue strength; increased subsurface micro-hardness and plastic deformation, mostly {{due to the}} ploughing of the round cutting tool edge associated with induced stresses, and can have far more superior surface properties than surfaces generated by grinding and polishing. Cutting edge roundness may induce stress and temperature fields on the machined subsurface and influence the finished surface properties as well as tool life. In this paper, a Finite Element Method (FEM) modeling approach with Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) fully coupled thermal-stress analysis is employed. In order to realistically simulate high speed machining using edge design tools, an FEM model for orthogonal cutting is designed and solution techniques such as adaptive meshing, and explicit dynamics are performed. Work material flow around the round edge-cutting tool is successfully simulated without implementing a chip separation criterion and {{without the use of}} a remeshing scheme. FEM simulations for machining-induced stresses by <b>round</b> <b>edge</b> cutting tools are performed for high speed machining of AISI AISI 4340 steel. Once FEM simulations are complete for different edge radii and depth of cuts, tool is unloaded and stresses are relieved. Stress fields are compared with experimentally measured residual stresses obtain from literature. The results indicate that the <b>round</b> <b>edge</b> design tools influence the stress and temperature fields greatly...|$|E
