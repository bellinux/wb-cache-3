500|$|Two {{organizations}} have formed {{to promote the}} exhibition of flat-shod horses. The NWHA promotes only naturally-gaited horses in its sanctioned horse shows, has its own rule book, and is the official USEF affiliate organization for the breed. The NWHA sanctions horse shows and licenses judges, and is an authorized HIO. The NWHA {{was in the process}} of building its own [...] "tracking registry" [...] to document both pedigree and performance achievements of horses recorded there. These included the Spotted Saddle Horse and Racking Horse breeds as well as the Tennessee Walker. However, the NWHA was sued by the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders & Exhibitors Association (TWHBEA), which eventually won some concessions regarding the use of the TWHBEAâ€™s copyrighted registry certificates by the NWHA. While the judgment did not prohibit the NWHA from continuing its <b>registry</b> <b>service,</b> it is no longer actively advertised on the NWHA website.|$|E
2500|$|Register.com, Inc. v. Verio, Inc. (2000) is {{a further}} example of this {{temporary}} trend in which plaintiffs {{did not have to}} demonstrate any real interference. [...] Register.com, a domain name <b>registry</b> <b>service,</b> sued competitor Verio for using Register.com's proprietary WHOIS look-up service to find potential leads among its customer base. The court found that, by continuing to access Register.com's online customer database after being told to stop, Verio was trespassing on Register.com's WHOIS server. Register.com had specifically withdrawn its consent to Verio's use of search robots to review Register.com's customer list. The court held that Verio caused harm to Register.com's files through the use of these search robots and that the searches improperly taxed Register.com's server capacity.|$|E
