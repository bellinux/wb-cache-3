25|$|The {{increase}} in pressure produced by a single stage {{is limited by the}} relative velocity between the rotor and the fluid, and the turning and diffusion capabilities of the airfoils. A typical stage in a commercial compressor will produce a pressure increase of between 15% and 60% (pressure ratios of 1.15–1.6) at design conditions with a polytropic efficiency in the region of 90–95%. To achieve different pressure ratios, axial compressors are designed with different numbers of stages and rotational speeds. As a rule of thumb we can assume that each stage in a given compressor has the same temperature rise (Delta T). Therefore, at the entry, temperature (Tstage) to each stage must increase progressively through the compressor and the ratio (Delta T)/(Tstage) entry must decrease, thus implying a progressive reduction in stage pressure ratio through the unit. Hence the <b>rear</b> <b>stage</b> develops a significantly lower pressure ratio than the first stage.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis presents a simple, meanline {{analysis of the}} impact of blade roughness on the mass flow, work coefficient, and efficiency of a three-stage axial compressor {{as a function of the}} location of fouling. First, an extensive review is presented on the state-of-the-art of measuring compressor degradation and on the impact of roughness on loss and deviation in a compressor cascade. The performance of a baseline, three-stage compressor, which has hydrodynamically smooth blades, is predicted. Using this baseline geometry, the influence of roughness in the front, middle and <b>rear</b> <b>stages</b> is calculated using empirical data for the enhanced losses and increased deviation, with a stage stacking technique. Influence coefficients that relate percentage changes in one parameter to percentage changes in other parameters are calculated. This analysis predicts that the most sensitive parameter for predicting fouling in the front stages is the percentage change in mass flow and the most sensitive parameter for predicting fouling in the <b>rear</b> <b>stages</b> is the efficiency.

50|$|Although large flow {{compressors}} {{are usually}} all-axial, the <b>rear</b> <b>stages</b> on smaller units {{are too small}} to be robust. Consequently, these stages are often replaced by a single centrifugal unit. Very small flow compressors often employ two centrifugal compressors, connected in series. Although in isolation centrifugal compressors are capable of running at quite high pressure ratios (e.g. 10:1), impeller stress considerations limit the pressure ratio that can be employed in high overall pressure ratio engine cycles.|$|R

40|$|Fishery {{discards}} in the Belgian {{part of the}} North Sea are {{a source}} of food for Herring Gulls Larus argentatus and Lesser Black-backed Gulls L. fuscus. To understand the importance of discards for local L. argentatus and L. fuscus populations, single-item discard experiments were performed at four offshore distances from the gullery of the Port of Zeebrugge, at four different stages of the breeding season (May to August 2011). We compared flock composition during discarding with the distribution of Herring and Lesser Black-backed Gulls, with respect to offshore distance from the colony as reflected by an 11 -year (2002 – 2013) dataset of standardised ship-based surveys. Consumption of discards depended on the type of fish that was discarded, but prey selectivity by adults was reduced during the chick <b>rearing</b> <b>stage.</b> A generalised linear mixed model identified the number of scavengers following the vessel, the proportion of adults and of Herring Gulls in the flock and the frequency of food robbery events interacting with the stage of the breeding season as affecting the variation in flatfish consumption. Shifts in scavenger flock composition and discard consumption between stages of the breeding season are likely linked to variation in food requirements of the gull population along the season and to dispersal patterns towards the end of summer. Nutrient requirements of breeding adults peak during the chick <b>rearing</b> <b>stage,</b> making this a key period in terms of dependence of the breeding parents on discarded fish as food source...|$|R

40|$|Trivers’ {{theory of}} sexual {{conflict}} in parental investment has {{laid the groundwork}} for immense quantities of research, especially within the avian taxa. Although male benefits of extra-pair copulation (EPC) are argued to be well-understood, female benefits are harder to explain. Nevertheless, EPC is thought to be female driven and so current research is focusing on possible explanations for female benefits. In 2014, Eliassen & Jørgensen suggested that female-driven EPC is based on the spreading of male interest among neighbouring families. EPC creates incentives for male cooperation in a neighbourhood, contributing to benefits for females and her offspring. We tested this, and more specifically looked at possible sex differences between parents regarding antipredator behaviour and extra-pair paternity (EPP) rates. The study was conducted on a blue tit population in southern France, Montpellier. We exposed parental birds to a taxidermy predator or novel object before egg laying. Antipredator behaviour of exposed nests and naïve neighbours was later observed during the chick <b>rearing</b> <b>stage.</b> DNA samples were collected from parents and offspring to determine EPP rates. We found that both parents reduced their antipredator behaviour in nests that contained extra-pair young, both in the form of alarming less and taking fewer risks by keeping a farther distance. We did not find any significant sex differences between parents. Our results showed no difference in EPP rates between predator-exposed and control nests (object-exposed). We did not find any evidence of a difference in antipredator behaviour during chick <b>rearing</b> <b>stage</b> between the different exposed nests, although due to a modest dataset this experiment should be repeated in consecutive years before making any firm conclusions...|$|R
