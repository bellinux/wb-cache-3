50|$|Once in Pend Oreille County, {{the highway}} curved {{northeast}} past Secondary State Highway 6B (SSH 6B) and Diamond Lake, {{which also has}} a community named after the lake, into Newport. In Newport, the road turned north and intersected its branch route, which connected east to Idaho and US 2 left to become co-signed with the branch. After US 2 left, PSH 6 once again turned northwest along the Pend Oreille River and a former route of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (now the Pend Oreille Valley Railroad) to Usk, where SSH 6B was intersected again. From Usk, the roadway continued north past Cusick, Locke, Jared and <b>Ruby</b> to <b>Tiger,</b> where SSH 6A branched off the highway and traveled west to Colville. The road traveled through Ione and Metaline to Metaline Falls, the terminus of the railroad and the last major community on the roadway until the Canada-US border. PSH 6 bridged the Pend Oreille River at Metaline Falls and traveled north to the Canada-US border, where it became British Columbia Highway 6 (BC 6). The southern terminus in Spokane was the busiest section of the highway in 1960, with a daily average of 4,850 motorists; the busiest section in Pend Oreile County was at Newport city limits with a daily average of 2,150 motorists in 1960.|$|R

50|$|In the EuropaChampionat at Hoppegarten he {{was again}} beaten by Kornado when he {{finished}} second, with the British-trained colts River North and Beneficial in third and fourth and the Grand Prix de Paris winner Fort Wood in fifth. In September Lando was matched gainst older horses {{for the first time}} when he contested the Group One Grosser Preis von Baden over 2400 metres at Ifflezheim Racecourse.

50|$|Roussalka {{remained}} in {{training as a}} four-year-old but made only three appearances. After finishing fifth on her debut she showed some promise when running fourth behind Duboff in the Child Stakes. At Goodwood in July he attmpted {{to become the first}} horse to record successive victories in the Nassau Stakes. Ridden as usual by Piggott she started at odds of 15/8 against a field which included Sauceboat, to whom she was conceding three pounds. Roussalka looked beaten when she dropped to seventh place approaching the straight, but under a strong ride from Piggott, she produce a sustained run in the last quarter mile to overhaul Sauceboat in the final strides. Her feat of winning the race twice was subsequently matched by <b>Ruby</b> <b>Tiger</b> in 1991 and 1992 and superseded by Midday, who won the race three times in 2009, 2010 and 2011.|$|E
50|$|In the Group One Yorkshire Oaks on 22 August, Hellenic started 100/30 second {{favourite}} {{behind her}} stablemate Kartajana, {{the winner of}} the Nassau Stakes.

The other four runners were Wajd (Prix Minerve), Game Plan (Pretty Polly Stakes, runner-up in the Epsom Oaks), Cruising Height (runner-up in the Lancashire Oaks) and <b>Ruby</b> <b>Tiger</b> (later to win the E P Taylor Stakes). Hellenic was towards the rear of the field in the early stages as Cruising Height set the pace from Kartajana and began to come under pressure at half way. Kartajana took the lead approaching the last quarter mile but Hellenic, switched to the outside by Carson, began to make progress before overtaking her stable companion inside the final furlong and winning by one and a half lengths.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt: This paper, {{based on}} the {{examination}} of 1, 879 specimens, serves to resolve the taxonomic problems involving the three North American species of Phragmatobia. The genus Phragmatobia, the <b>ruby</b> <b>tiger</b> moths, has had a checkered history since it was described by Stephens in 1829 (type, by monotypy, Noctua j 2 ̆ 7 uliginosa Linnaeus, 1758). Although many species have been described in or transferred to this genus, in both the Old and New Worlds, {{most of them have}} been removed to other genera. By 1902 Dyar recognized only two North American species, a status since then unchanged (McDunnough, 1938; Forbes, 1960). Despite the recent stability of the names, there has been much confusion as to which names to apply to particular specimens. This problem is resolved below, with the description of a third North American species, long confused with the two named species...|$|E
