The hot spot activity is found in crosses of red- gam- chi- strains in rec+ hosts; in the crosses reported here, both the chi- mutations and the hot spot are located near the right end of the chromosome.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a system to}} analyze the individual contribution of a single physical DNA end on intramolecular recombination between partially homologous sequences. We took advantage of this partial sequence divergence to measure the distance separating the DNA end from the final recombination event. We show that a single physical DNA end stimulates recombination when located in a region of homology. Recombination frequency decreases gradually with {{the distance from the}} DNA end. A <b>recombinational</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> is found {{at the end of the}} region of homology. A large insertion of unrelated DNA interferes asymmetrically with this process, suggesting that a recombinogenic signal propagates along the region of homology...|$|E

When DNA fragments containing M 26 and up to 3. 0 kilobases of surrounding DNA were moved to the ura 4 gene or to a multicopy plasmid, M 26 had no detectable hot spot activity. Our results indicate that nucleotide sequences at least 1 kilobase away from M 26 are required for M 26 hot spot activity and suggest that, as for transcriptional promoters, a second site or proper chromatin structure is required for activation of this eukaryotic <b>recombinational</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spot.</b> We discuss {{the implications of these}} results for studies of other meiotic recombinational hot spots and for gene targeting...|$|E
40|$|PSM 2, PSM 1, and PSM 15 {{are small}} {{plasmids}} derived from R 100 by spontaneous deletions {{at either end}} of the insertion sequence IS 1. These plasmids were used to identify regions neighboring IS 1 as well as the IS 1 DNA itself, by cleavage with EcoR 1, HindIII, Hae III, Hpa II, Hha I, Hinf, and AIu I. The nucleotide sequencing results demonstrate that IS 1 contains 768 bases. About 30 bases at the ends of IS 1 were found to be repeated in an inverted order. The deletions occurring at the ends of IS 1 were found to be due to illegitimate recombination. The hypothesis that RNA polymerase could play an important role in such recombination phenomena is discussed based on the nucleotide sequences surrounding the <b>recombinational</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spots...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} four {{asymptotically}} equivalent estimates of kinship are derived, {{in the general}} case and for kinship between multiallelic loci. Two estimates based on chi 2 agree closely, with the Shannon estimate giving the smaller variance. The PAH, GH, GM, and HBB systems conform to a recombinational model with an evolutionary size of approximately 4, 000 and a ratio of recombination to physical distance of approximately 1. 4 X 10 (- 5) morgans/kb, as predicted {{on the basis of}} the genetic and physical lengths of the human genome. The INS and D 11 S 12 systems have a much more rapid decline of kinship with physical distance, suggesting overlapping RFLPs (unrecognized allelism), <b>recombinational</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spots,</b> or selection.

40|$|A {{multicopy}} plasmid was isolated from a yeast genomic library, whose presence {{resulted in a}} twofold increase in meiotic nondisjunction of chromosome III. The plasmid contains a 7. 5 -kb insert {{from the middle of}} the right arm of chromosome III, including the gene THR 4. Using chromosomal fragments derived from chromosome III, we determined that the cloned region caused a significant, specific, cis-acting increase in chromosome III nondisjunction in the first meiotic division. The plasmid containing this segment exhibited high spontaneous meiotic integration into chromosome III (in 2. 4 % of the normal meiotic divisions) and a sixfold increase (15. 5 %) in integration in nondisjunctant meioses. Genetic analysis of the cloned region revealed that it contains a ``hot spot'' for meiotic recombination. In DNA of rad 50 S mutant cells, a strong meiosis-induced double strand break (DSB) signal was detected in this region. We discuss the possible relationships between meiosis-induced DSBs, recombination and chromosome disjunction, and propose that <b>recombinational</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> may be ``pairing sites'' for homologous chromosomes in meiosis...|$|R
40|$|The RecBCD enzyme from Escherichia coli is an ATP-dependent helicase and an ATP-stimulated nuclease. The 3 ′ → 5 ′ {{exonuclease}} {{activity on}} double-stranded DNA is suppressed when the enzyme encounters a <b>recombinational</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spot,</b> called chi (χ). We have prepared a RecB deletion mutant (RecB 1 – 929) by using results of limited proteolysis experiments that {{indicated that the}} RecB subunit consists of two main domains. The RecB 1 – 929 protein, comprising the 100 -kDa N-terminal domain of RecB, is an ATP-dependent helicase and a single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase. Reconstitution of RecB 1 – 929 with RecC and RecD leads to processive unwinding of a linearized plasmid. However, the reconstituted RecB 1 – 929 CD enzyme has lost the single-strand endo- and exonuclease and the double-strand exonuclease activities of the RecBCD enzyme. These {{results show that the}} 30 -kDa C-terminal domain of RecB has {{an important role in the}} nuclease activity of RecBCD. On the basis of these findings, we propose the RecB C-terminal domain swing model to explain RecBCD’s transformation from a 3 ′ → 5 ′ exonuclease to a helicase when it meets a χ site...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the strong {{promoter}} from the alcohol dehydrogenase gene on mitotic and meiotic intragenic recombination has been studied at the ade 6 locus of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. A 700 -bp fragment containing the functional adh 1 promoter was used to replace the weak wild-type promoter of the ade 6 gene. Analysis of mRNA showed that strains with this ade 6 ::adh 1 fusion construct had strongly elevated ade 6 -specific mRNA levels during vegetative growth {{as well as in}} meiosis. These increased levels of mRNA correlated with a 20 - to 25 -fold stimulation of intragenic recombination in meiosis and a 7 -fold increased prototroph formation during vegetative growth. Analysis of flanking marker configurations of prototrophic recombinants indicated that simple conversions as well as conversions associated with crossing over were stimulated in meiosis. The strongest stimulation of recombination was observed when the adh 1 promoter was homozygous. Studies with heterologous promoter configurations revealed that the highly transcribed allele was the preferred acceptor of genetic information. The {{effect of the}} <b>recombinational</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> mutation ade 6 -M 26 was also investigated in this system. Its effect was only partly additive to the elevated recombination rate generated by the ade 6 ::adh 1 fusion construct...|$|E
40|$|The fifth exons {{of major}} {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) class I genes encode a transmembrane domain (TM) that is largely responsible for class I antigen cell-surface expression usually through conventional hydrophobic amino acid-membrane interactions or, less often, through phosphatidylinositol linkage. In this report we show that Peromyscus leucopus, a Cricetidae rodent, has MHC class I genes (Pele-A genes) encoding three distinct sizes of TMs. Increases in TM lengths were due to tandem duplications of sequences similar to human hypervariable minisatellite repeats and the lambda chi site. We discerned remnants of a similar duplication event in comparable rodent and primate MHC class I genes. Furthermore, several duplications and deletions appear to have occurred independently in H- 2, RT 1, Pele-A, and ChLA genes in near-identical positions. Accumulated data suggests that sequences in the fifth exon of MHC class I genes may, therefore, constitute a mutational or <b>recombinational</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> that is mediated by minisatellite- and chi-like sequences imbedded within the coding region. The MHC class I genes may thus have recruited "selfish" DNA in their evolution to encode cell surface proteins. Expression of Pele-A genes was examined by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using oligonucleotide primers specific for exon 4 and 5 sequences. The PCR product sizes indicated that genes encoding each TM domain length are ubiquitously transcribed...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a meiotic fine-structure mapping strategy for achieving molecular access to developmental mutations in the mouse. The induction of lethal point mutations with the potent germ-line mutagen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea has been reported. One lethal mutation of prime interest is an allele at the quaking locus on chromosome 17. To map this mutation, quaking(lethal- 1), we have intercrossed hybrid mice that carry distinct alleles at many classical and DNA marker loci on proximal chromosome 17. From this cross we have obtained 337 animals recombinant in the T to H- 2 region. This number of crossovers provides a mapping {{resolution in the}} size range of single mammalian genes if <b>recombinational</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> are absent. DNA samples obtained from these recombinant animals can be used retrospectively to map any {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} in the region. This set of DNA samples has been used to map the molecular marker D 17 RP 17 just distal of quaking(lethal- 1). With the nested set of crossover DNA samples and appropriate cloning techniques, this tightly linked marker can be used to clone the quaking locus...|$|R
40|$|Five {{different}} {{measures of}} gametic disequilibrium in current use {{and a new}} one based on R. C. Lewontin's D', are examined and compared. All of them, except the measure based on Lewontin's D', are highly dependent upon allelic frequencies, including four measures that are normalized in some manner. In addition, the measures suggested by A. H. D. Brown, M. F. Feldman and E. Nevo, and T. Ohta can have negative values when there is maximum disequilibrium and have rates of decay in infinite populations that are {{a function of the}} initial gametic array. The variances were large for all the measures in samples taken from populations at equilibrium under neutrality, with the measure based on D' having the lowest variance. In these samples, three of the measures were highly correlated, D 2, D* (equal to the correlation coefficient when there are two alleles at each locus) and the measure X(2) of Brown et al. Using frequency-dependent measures may result in mistaken conclusions, a fact illustrated by discussion of studies inferring <b>recombinational</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> and the effects of population bottlenecks from disequilibrium values...|$|R
40|$|The {{comparative}} analysis of five completely sequenced Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage genomes demonstrated that their diversification {{was achieved by}} a combination of DNA recombination events and an accumulation of point mutations. The five phages included lytic and temperate phages, both pac site and cos site, from three distinct geographical areas. The units of genetic exchange were either large, comprising the entire morphogenesis gene cluster, excluding the putative tail fiber genes, or small, consisting of one or maximally two genes or even segments of a gene. Many indels were flanked by DNA repeats. Differences in a single putative tail fiber gene correlated with the host ranges of the phages. The predicted tail fiber protein consisted of highly conserved domains containing conspicuous glycine repeats interspersed with highly variable domains. As in the T-even coliphage adhesins, the glycine-containing domains were <b>recombinational</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> Downstream of a highly conserved DNA replication region, all lytic phages showed a short duplication; in three isolates the origin of replication was repeated. The lytic phages could conceivably be derived from the temperate phages by deletion and multiple rearrangement events in the lysogeny module, giving rise to occasional selfish phages that defy the superinfection control systems of the corresponding temperate phages...|$|R
40|$|The gene {{encoding}} a 6 '-N-acetyltransferase, AAC(6 ') -II, was cloned from Pseudomonas aeruginosa plasmid pSCH 884. This gene mediates {{resistance to}} gentamicin, tobramycin, and netilmicin but not amikacin or isepamicin. The DNA {{sequence of the}} gene and flanking regions was determined. The 5 '- and 3 '-flanking sequences showed near identity to sequences found abutting {{a variety of different}} genes encoding resistance determinants. It is likely that the current structure arose by the integration of the 572 -base-pair sequence containing the AAC(6 ') -ll gene into a Tn 21 -related sequence at the <b>recombinational</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spot,</b> AAAGTT. We have compared the sequence of the AAC(6 ') -II gene to genes of other 6 '-N-acetyltransferases. An AAC(6 ') -Ib protein (encoded by the aacA 4 gene; G. Tran Van Nhieu and E. Collatz, J. Bacteriol. 169 : 5708 - 5714, 1987) that results in resistance to amikacin but not gentamicin was found to share 82 % sequence similarity with the AAC(6 ') -II protein. We speculate that these two genes arose from a common ancestor and that the processes of selection and dissemination have led to the observed differences in the spectrum of aminoglycoside resistance. Bacteria produce three types of enzymes that are capable of modifying aminoglycosides. The clinical observation of high levels of aminoglycoside resistance is often due to enzymatic inactivation by these acetyltransferases, nucleoti...|$|E
40|$|Infection of alfalfa by {{the soil}} {{bacterium}} Rhizobium meliloti proceeds by deformation of root hairs and bacterial invasion of host tissue {{by way of}} an infection thread. We studied an 8. 7 -kilobase (kb) segment of the R. meliloti megaplasmid, which contains genes required for infection. Site-directed Tn 5 mutagenesis {{was used to examine}} this fragment for nodulation genes. A total of 81 R. meliloti strains with mapped Tn 5 insertions in the 8. 7 -kb fragment were evaluated for nodulation phenotype on alfalfa plants; 39 of the insertions defined a 3. 5 -kb segment containing nodulation functions. Of these 39 mutants, 37 were completely nodulation deficient (Nod-), and 2 at the extreme nif-distal end were leaky Nod-. Complementation analysis was performed by inoculating plants with strains carrying a genomic Tn 5 at one location and a plasmid-borne Tn 5 at another location in the 3. 5 -kb nodulation segment. Mutations near the right border of the fragment behaved as two distinct complementation groups. The segment in which these mutations are located was analyzed by DNA sequencing. Several open reading frames were found in this region, but the one most likely to function is 1, 206 bases long, reading from left to right (nif distal to proximal) and spanning both mutation groups. The genetic behavior of this segment may be due either to the gene product having two functional domains or to a <b>recombinational</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> between the apparent complementation groups...|$|E
40|$|Bloom's {{syndrome}} (BS) is a recessive human {{genetic disorder}} characterized by short stature, immunodeficiency and elevated risk of malignancy. BS cells have genomic instability {{and an increased}} frequency of sister chromatid exchange. The gene mutated in BS, BLM, encodes a 3 '- 5 ' helicase (BLM) with homology to bacterial recombination factor, RecQ. Human males homozygous for BLM mutations are infertile and heterozygous individuals display increased frequencies of structural chromosome abnormalities in their spermatozoa. Also, mutations in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homolog of BLM, Sgs 1, cause a delay in meiotic nuclear division {{and a reduction in}} spore viability. These observations suggest that BLM may play a role during meiosis. Our antibodies raised against the C terminus of the human protein specifically recognize both mouse and human BLM in western blots of cell lines and in successive developmental stages of spermatocytes, but fail to detect BLM protein in a cell line with a C-terminally truncated protein. BLM protein expression and location are detected by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy as discrete foci that are sparsely present on early meiotic prophase chromosome cores, later found abundantly on synapsed cores, frequently in combination with the recombinases RAD 51 and DMC 1, and eventually as pure BLM foci. The colocalization of RAD 51 /DMC 1 with BLM and the statistically significant excess of BLM signals in the synapsed pseudoautosomal region of the X-Y chromosomes, which is a <b>recombinational</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spot,</b> provide indications that BLM protein may function in the meiotic recombination process...|$|E
40|$|High density genetic {{maps are}} a {{reliable}} tool for genetic dissection of complex plant traits. Mapping resolution is often {{hampered by the}} variable crossover and non-crossover events occurring across the genome, with pericentromeric regions (pCENR) showing highly suppressed recombination rates. The efficiency of linkage mapping can further be improved by characterizing and understanding the distribution of recombinational activity along individual chromosomes. In order to evaluate the genome wide recombination rate in common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) we developed a SNP-based linkage map using the genotype-by-sequencing approach with a 188 recombinant inbred line family generated from an inter gene pool cross (Andean x Mesoamerican). We identified 1, 112 SNPs that were subsequently used to construct a robust linkage map with 11 groups, comprising 513 recombinationally unique marker loci spanning 943 cM (LOD 3. 0). Comparative analysis showed that the linkage map spanned > 95 % of the physical map, indicating that the map is almost saturated. Evaluation of genome-wide recombination rate indicated that at least 45 % of the genome is highly recombinationally suppressed, and allowed us to estimate locations of pCENRs. We observed an average recombination rate of 0. 25 cM/Mb in pCENRs {{as compared to the}} rest of genome that showed 3. 72 cM/Mb. However, several <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> of recombination were also detected with recombination rates reaching as high as 34 cM/Mb. Hotspots were mostly found towards the end of chromosomes, which also happened to be gene-rich regions. Analyzing relationships between linkage and physical map indicated a punctuated distribution of <b>recombinational</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> across the genome...|$|R
40|$|Guanine-rich {{sequences}} {{are vital}} {{components in the}} genomes of many organisms. For example, G-rich sequences are found in telomeres, fragile X locus, promoters, IgG switch regions, <b>recombinational</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> and the HIV RNA dimerization domain. The functions of these G-rich sequences rely in part on guanine self-recognition. G-rich sequences can adopt a quadruple helical conformation {{in the presence of}} specific monovalent and divalent metal cations which are also required for maintaining the quadruplex stability. The structural basis of the quadruplex is a cyclic Hoogsteen hydrogen bonded guanine tetrad known as the G-quartet. Sequences capable of forming G-quartets are classified as G-DNA. The family of G-DNA structures includes anti-parallel hairpin dimer conformations (G 2 ̆ 72 -DNA) and parallel tetramer conformations (G 4 -DNA). In this work we have employed the techniques of gel electrophoresis, UV spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to study a new G 4 -DNA nanostructure. The oligonucleotide d(GGGGTTGGGG) (Tet 1. 5) self-assembles into highly ordered filamentous polymers that we call G-wires. The self-assembly of Tet 1. 5 into G-wires is shown by gel electrophoresis to be highly ordered and dependent on specific metal cations. G-wires have characteristics that are unique to G-DNA. AFM analysis of G-wires complimented the electrophoretic studies and revealed the highly ordered structures to be filamentous polymers. G-wires exhibit resistance to distortion by the scanning probe that is related to their structural characteristics. This study indicates that G-wires could function as a scaffold enabling the controlled positioning of atoms and molecules in space, the primary goal of nanotechnology...|$|R
40|$|Two novel plasmids, coined pHB 44 and pBS 64, were {{recently}} found in Variovorax paradoxus strains HB 44 and BS 64 {{isolated from the}} mycosphere of Laccaria proxima, on two different sampling occasions. We here describe the full sequences of pHB 44 and pBS 64 and establish their evolutionary placement and ecological function. Both plasmids, unique for mycospheric V paradoxus, were around 58 kb in size. They possessed, in a very similar fashion, three main plasmid backbone regions, which were predicted {{to be involved in}} plasmid replication, central control of maintenance, and conjugational transfer. Phylogenetic inference on the basis of seven selected and concatenated plasmid backbone genes provided solid evidence for the placement of the two plasmids in the IncP- 10 group, with the recently isolated IncP- 10 plasmid pMBUI 8 as the closest relative. A comparative analysis of the sequences present in each of the <b>recombinational</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> (RHS) I to III across plasmids pHB 44, pBS 64, and pMBUI 8 revealed the insertions found in plasmids pHB 44 and pBS 64 to be different from those of pMBUI 8. Whereas, in the former two plasmids, RHS I and III were devoid of any major inserts, their RHS II regions contained inserts of 15, 043 (pHB 44) and 16, 406 kb (pBS 64), against about 9, 3 kb for pMBUI 8. Interestingly, these regions were highly similar across plasmids pHB 44 and pBS 64, and differed from that of pMBUI 8. Closer inspection revealed the insert in the former plasmids to contain, next to transposases, an "mmf" gene cassette previously reported to encode metal-responsiveness" in the PromA plasmid pM 0 L 98. Whereas the plasmid pHB 44 RHS II contained the canonical mmf sequence, that in pBS 64 contained, in addition, a "two-gene duplicated region" flanking the mmfC 2 gene. In vitro experiments on the growth and survival of strains with or without plasmid pHB 44 suggested this plasmid was involved in the binding and import of Fe 3 + as well as V 3 + ions into the host cells, thus yielding a growth advantage under "metal ion-limiting" conditions. In addition, pHB 44 was found to confer a bacitracin resistance phenotype to its host strain HB 44. The metal import and bacitracin resistance traits were tentatively attributed to specific genes present in the RHS II inserts...|$|R
40|$|Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) genome {{isomerization}} {{occurs as}} a result of DNA replication-mediated homologous recombination between several sets of inverted repeat sequences present in the viral DNA. The frequency with which this recombination occurs has been demonstrated to be dependent upon DNA homology length rather than specific sequences. However, the smallest of the viral inverted repeats, the a sequence, has been shown to function as a <b>recombinational</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spot,</b> leading to speculation that this sequence may represent a specific element through which genome isomerization is mediated. To investigate this apparent paradox, a quantitative transient recombination assay system was developed and used to examine the recombinogenic properties of a panel of a sequence mutants. This analysis revealed that the presence of both the pacl and pac 2 elements was both necessary and sufficient for the induction of high-frequency recombination events by the a sequence. However, it was the double-strand break promoted by pacl and pac 2 during cleavage and packaging at the a sequence, and not the DNA sequences of the elements themselves, which appeared to be critical for recombination. This was illustrated (i) by the inability of the same pacl and pac 2 sequences to mediate inversion events in cells infected with an HSV- 1 mutant which was competent for DNA replication-dependent recombination but defective for the cleavage and packaging process and (ii) by the ability of double-strand breaks generated in non-HSV- 1 DNA by an in vivo-expressed restriction endonuclease to significantly stimulat...|$|E

We report here the complete nucleotide sequence of the OXA- 1 beta-lactamase gene and flanking sequences. The OXA- 1 gene shows a greater than 50 % sequence divergence from the OXA- 2 gene, yet there is significant functional similarity at the peptide level. Analysis of 5 ' and 3 ' flanking sequences shows that Tn 2603 differs from its probable precursor, Tn 21, by a precise 1004 -base-pair insertion, containing the OXA- 1 structural gene, at the target sequence AAAGTT, which is located between the Tn 21 streptomycin/spectinomycin (aadA) promoter and its structural gene. A 5 - for 6 -base repeat of the target sequence is found {{at the end of}} the insertion. The same precise insertion and repeat of the target sequence are found for the OXA- 2 gene from R 46.

40|$|Unraveling {{the drivers}} {{controlling}} the response and adaptation of biological communities to environmental change, especially anthropogenic activities, {{is a central}} but poorly understood issue in ecology and evolution. Comparative genomics studies suggest that lateral gene transfer (LGT) is a major force driving microbial genome evolution, but {{its role in the}} evolution of microbial communities remains elusive. To delineate the importance of LGT in mediating the response of a groundwater microbial community to heavy metal contamination, representative Rhodanobacter reference genomes were sequenced and compared to shotgun metagenome sequences. 16 S rRNA gene-based amplicon sequence analysis indicated that Rhodanobacter populations were highly abundant in contaminated wells with low pHs and high levels of nitrate and heavy metals but remained rare in the uncontaminated wells. Sequence comparisons revealed that multiple geochemically important genes, including genes encoding Fe 2 +/Pb 2 + permeases, most denitrification enzymes, and cytochrome c 553, were native to Rhodanobacter and not subjected to LGT. In contrast, the Rhodanobacter pangenome contained a <b>recombinational</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> in which numerous metal resistance genes were subjected to LGT and/or duplication. In particular, Co 2 +/Zn 2 +/Cd 2 + efflux and mercuric resistance operon genes appeared to be highly mobile within Rhodanobacter populations. Evidence of multiple duplications of a mercuric resistance operon common to most Rhodanobacter strains was also observed. Collectively, our analyses indicated the importance of LGT during the evolution of groundwater microbial communities in response to heavy metal contamination, and a conceptual model was developed to display such adaptive evolutionary processes for explaining the extreme dominance of Rhodanobacter populations in the contaminated groundwater microbiome...|$|E

Thus the common practice of identifying <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> using a short time window of crime data and assuming that the resulting <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> will persist is ineffective for temporary <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> Instead it is necessary to forecast the emergence of temporary <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> to prevent their crimes.

The rate of oscillation between the Vi-producing (Vi+) state and the Vi-nonproducing (Vi-) state in strain WR 7004 ranges from 2 X 10 (- 4) to 7 X 10 (- 3) transitions per bacterium per generation. A similarly high conversion rate from Vi+ to Vi- occurs in Escherichia coli HB 101 harboring pWR 127, a plasmid that contains the 18 -kilobase-pair (kb) viaB region cloned from WR 7004. However, the Vi- state in HB 101 harboring pWR 127 was so stable that transition to the Vi+ state was not detected (less than 10 (- 10) per bacterium per generation). When pWR 127 DNA derived from Vi- strains of HB 101 harboring pWR 127 was transformed in HB 101 recipient, {{a small number of}} Vi+ transformants were seen among the transformants, which were predominantly Vi-. The viaB region consists of two EcoRI digestion fragments, A (8. 6 kb) and B (9. 4 kb). A discrete 700 - to 800 -base-pair DNA element was found to be inserted in the EcoRI B fragment of the viaB region of pWR 127 when derived from Vi- strains.

The insertion of this IS 1 -like element in the viaB region thus disrupts expression of the Vi antigen. Restoration of Vi expression results when this element is excised...|$|E
40|$|Many {{strains of}} Bacteroides harbor large {{chromosomal}} elements that can transfer {{themselves from the}} chromosome of the donor to the chromosome of the recipient. Most of them carry a tetracycline resistance (Tcr) gene and have thus been designated Tcr elements. In the present study, we have used transverse alternating field electrophoresis to show that {{all but one of}} the Tcr elements screened were approximately 70 to 80 kbp in size. The exception (Tcr Emr 12256) was 150 to 200 kbp in size and may be a hybrid element. All of the Tcr elements inserted in more than one site, but insertion was not random. The Tcr elements sometimes cotransfer unlinked chromosomal segments, or nonreplicating Bacteroides units (NBUs). Transverse alternating field electrophoresis analysis showed that insertion of NBUs was not random and that the NBUs did not insert near the Tcr element. Although attempts to clone one or both ends of a Tcr element have not been successful, ends of a cryptic element (XBU 4422) were cloned previously and shown to be homologous to the ends of Tcr elements. We have obtained DNA sequences of junction regions between XBU 4422 and its target from several different insertions. Comparison of junction sequences with target sequences showed that no target site duplication occurred during insertion and that XBU 4422 carried 4 to 5 bp of adjacent chromosomal DNA when it excised from the chromosome and inserted in a plasmid. We identified a short region of sequence similarity between one of the ends of XBU 4422 and its target site that may be important for insertion. This sequence contained an 8 -bp segment that was identical to the <b>recombinational</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> sequence on Tn 21. XBU 4422 could exise itself from plasmids into which it inserted. In most cases, the excision left a single additional A behind in the target site, but precise excision was seen in one case...|$|E

40|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>spotting</b> is a {{reliability}} {{problem in}} photovoltaic (PV) panels where a mismatched cell heats up significantly and degrades panel performance. High temperatures due to <b>hot</b> <b>spotting</b> can damage cell encapsulant {{and lead to}} second breakdown; both cause permanent damage to the PV panel. Although bypass diodes are used for protection and qualification tests are used to reduce cell mismatch, these strategies are shown to be insufficient for <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> prevention. This paper reexamines the <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> problem in PV strings through simulation and load-line analysis. Results show that cells in typical panel string lengths are susceptible to <b>hot</b> <b>spotting</b> because of reverse bias behavior. A number of existing and emerging solutions aimed at <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> prevention are discussed and evaluated. Commercially available active bypass switches are an improvement over passive diodes but do not prevent <b>hot</b> <b>spotting.</b> Cells with low breakdown voltages limit power dissipation but are not fully vetted as a long-term solution. A combination of <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> detection and open-circuit protection is a complete solution to <b>hot</b> <b>spotting.</b> close...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} crime <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> near licensed premises in the night-time economy (NTE) {{to investigate}} whether <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> of four different classification of crime and disorder co-occur in time and place, namely violence, disorder, drugs and criminal damage. It introduces the concept of multi-classification crime (MCC) hot spots; the presence of <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> {{of more than one}} crime classification at the same place. Furthermore, it explores the temporal patterns of identified MCC <b>hot</b> <b>spots,</b> to determine if they exhibit distinct spatio-temporal patterns. Getis Ord (GI*) <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> analysis was used to identify locations of statistically significant <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> of each of the four crime and disorder classifications. Strong spatial correlations were found between licensed premises and each of the four crime and disorder classifications analysed. MCC <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> were also identified near licensed premises. Temporal profiling of the MCC <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> revealed all four crime types were simultaneously present in time and place, near licensed premises, on Friday through Sunday {{in the early hours of}} the morning around premise closing times. At other times, criminal damage and drugs <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> were found to occur earlier in the evening, and disorder and violence at later time periods. Criminal damage and drug <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> flared for shorter time periods, 2 – 3 h, whereas disorder and violence <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> were present for several hours. There was a small spatial lag between Friday and Saturday, with offences occurring approximately 1 h later on Saturdays.

40|$|Abstract Background Meiotic {{recombination}} {{events have}} been found to concentrate in 1 – 2. 5 kilo base regions, but these recombination <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> do not share a consensus sequence and why they occur at specific sites is not fully understood. Some previous evidence suggests that poly-purine/poly-pyrimidine (poly-pu/py) tracts (PPTs), a class of sequence with distinctive biochemical properties, could be involved in recombination, but no general association of PPTs with meiotic recombination <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> has previously been reported. Results We used computational methods to investigate in detail the relationship between PPTs and <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> We show statistical associations of PPT frequency with <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> of meiotic recombination initiating lesions, double-strand breaks, in the genome of the yeast S. cerevisiae and with experimentally well characterized human meiotic recombination <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> Supporting a possible role of poly-pu/py-rich sequences in <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> recombination, we also found that all three single nucleotide polymorphisms previously shown to be associated with human <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> activity changes occur within sequence contexts of 14 bp or longer that are 85 % or more poly-pu/py and at least 70 % G/C. These polymorphisms are all close to the <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> mid points. Comparing the sequences of experimentally characterized human <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> with the orthologous regions of the chimpanzee genome previously shown not to contain <b>hot</b> <b>spots,</b> we found that in all five cases in which comparisons for the <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> central regions are possible with publicly available sequence data, there are differences near the human <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> mid points within sequences 14 bp or longer consisting of more than 80 % poly-pu/py and at least 50 % G/C. Conclusion Our results, along with previous evidence for the unique biochemical properties and recombination-stimulating potential of poly-pu/py-rich sequences, suggest that the possible functional involvement of this type of sequence in meiotic recombination <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> deserves further experimental exploration. </p...|$|R
