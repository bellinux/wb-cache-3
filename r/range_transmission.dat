[...] This part of the energy is radiative, meaning it leaves the antenna {{whether or not there is}} a receiver to absorb it. [...] The portion of energy which does not strike the receiving antenna is dissipated and lost to the system. The amount of power emitted as electromagnetic waves by an antenna depends on the ratio of the antenna's size Dant to the wavelength of the waves λ, which is determined by the frequency: λ=c/f. [...] At low frequencies f where the antenna is much smaller than the size of the waves, Dant<<nbsp&λ, very little power is radiated. [...] Therefore the near-field devices above, which use lower frequencies, radiate almost none of their energy as electromagnetic radiation. [...] Antennas about the same size as the wavelength [...] Dantnbsp&≈nbsp&λ [...] such as monopole or dipole antennas, [...] radiate power efficiently, but the electromagnetic waves are radiated in all directions (omnidirectionally), so if the receiving antenna is far away, only a small amount of the radiation will hit it.

40|$|In a {{wireless}} sensor network (WSN), the energy hole problem is a key factor which affects the lifetime of the networks. In a WSN with circular multi-hop deployment (modeled as concentric coronas), sensors in one corona have the same <b>transmission</b> <b>range</b> termed as the <b>transmission</b> <b>range</b> of this corona, and different coronas have different <b>transmission</b> <b>ranges,</b> which compose a list termed as <b>transmission</b> <b>range</b> list.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{analytical}} relationship between <b>transmission</b> <b>range</b> {{and the network}} connectivity is obtained {{as a function of}} number of nodes for CDMA based Multihop Cellular Network (MCN). We show that for a network of n uniformly distributed nodes in a single cell of unit radius, the <b>transmission</b> <b>range</b> r should be sufficiently larger than root 2 ln n/n- 1 to achieve asymptotic full connectivity. The distribution of the nodes may not be uniform in case of mobility. In such case a mobility model dependent lower bound on <b>transmission</b> <b>range</b> is obtained. We show that for RWP model the lower bound for the nodes which lie completely inside the cell is same as the corresponding uniform node distribution case. However, for nodes on boundary the <b>transmission</b> <b>range</b> lower bound is (3) root ln n/n which is larger than the corresponding uniform node distribution case. Our findings show that more <b>transmission</b> <b>range</b> is required at the boundary to establish better connectivity and hence a variable <b>transmission</b> <b>range</b> control mechanism is necessary. In addition to lower bound, we also propose a method to choose the optimal value of <b>transmission</b> <b>range</b> using a scheduling mechanism and ensure that the optimal value is always greater than the lower bound. Thus obtained <b>transmission</b> <b>range</b> could be used to select the transmission power of the nodes in a meaningful way and hence the nodes' isolation could be avoided and the spectral efficiency can be increased.
