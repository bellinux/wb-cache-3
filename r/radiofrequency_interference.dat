Sixty four transducers (0. 45 -mm wide by 15 -mm tall), operating at 4. 6 MHz, were spread around the periphery of a 10. 6 -mm diameter cylinder. The head of the applicator {{was covered with a}} 65 ­µm thick latex balloon attached using watertight seals. This envelope was inflated with degassed water to provide acoustic coupling between the transducer and the tissues. The underlying operating principle of this applicator is to rotate a plane ultrasound beam electronically. For this purpose, eight adjacent transducers were excited with appropriate delay times so as to generate a plane wave. The exposure direction was changed by exciting a different set of eight elements. Ex vivo experiments conducted on 47 samples of pig liver under MR temperature monitoring demonstrated the ability of this applicator to generate cylindrical or sector-based coagulation necroses at depths up to 19 mm with excellent angular precision by applying 20 W/cm 2. MR-thermometry was performed in “real-time” with segmented echo-planar imaging gradient echo sequences. The temporal resolution was approximately 3 s / image. The average value for the temperature baseline in liver tissue close to the applicator was 0. 3 °C (± 0. 6 °C). The thermal dose delivered in tissues was computed on-line during temperature imaging. Excellent MR compatibility was demonstrated, all MR acquisitions were performed without susceptibility artefacts or <b>radiofrequency</b> <b>interferences</b> with the ultrasound device.

40|$|Since soil {{moisture}} {{is an important}} influencing factor of the hydrological cycle, knowledge of its spatio- temporal dynamics is crucial for climate and hydrological modeling. In recent years several {{soil moisture}} data products from satellite information have become available with global coverage and sub-monthly resolution. Since the remote sensing of soil moisture is an indirect measurement method and influenced by {{a large number of}} factors (e. g. atmospheric correction, vegetation, soil roughness etc.), a comprehensive validation of the resulting soil moisture products is required. However, the coarse spatial resolution of these products hampers the comparison with point-scale in situ measurements. Therefore, upscaling of in situ to the scale of the satellite data is needed. We present the validation results of the soil moisture products of the years 2010 to 2012 retrieved from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) for the Rur and Erft catchments in western Germany. For the upscaling of in situ data obtained from three test sites of the Terrestrial Environmental Observatories (TERENO) initiative we used the hydrological model WaSiM ETH. Correlation of the SMOS product to modeled and upscaled soil moisture resulted in a mean correlation coefficient of 0. 28 whereas for ASCAT a correlation coefficient of 0. 50 was obtained. However, for specific regions the SMOS product showed similar correlation coefficients as the ASCAT product.

40|$|Abstract: Introduction Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and {{diffusion}} tensor imaging (DTI) combine {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (MRI) techniques and diffusion measures. In DWI, the contrast is defined by microscopic motion of water protons. Nowadays, DWI has become important for early diagnostic of acute stroke. DTI images are calculated from DWI images acquired in at least six directions, which give information of diffusion directionality, {{making it possible to}} reconstruct axonal or muscle fiber images. Both techniques have been applied to study body structures in healthy and pathological conditions. Currently, it is known that these images and derived parameters are quite sensitive to factors related to acquisition and processing. Magnetic field inhomogeneity, susceptibility, chemical shift, <b>radiofrequency</b> (RF) <b>interference,</b> eddy currents and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can have a more harmful effect in diffusion data than in T 1 - or T 2 -weighted image data.

Multimodal registration was performed between a high-resolution T 1 3 -dimensional (3 D) gradient echo (volume interpolated gradient echo) during breath-hold and a simultaneously acquired 2 D US image, or equivalent, retrospective registration of US imaging probe in the coordinate frame of MRI.

40|$|Background: Contemporary implantable {{heart rhythm}} devices {{communicate}} multiple complex data simultaneously using <b>radiofrequency</b> telemetry. <b>Interference</b> in communication can {{expose them to}} the risk of potential corruption, leading to adverse clinical consequences. Methods & Results: We studied the characteristics of interference with uplink (real time intracardiac electrograms, marker channel, and stored histograms) and downlink (attempt to program a change in the lower rate limit, the pacing mode, and the ventricular lead configuration) data transmission between the wand and the pacemaker caused by digital media players (iPods—Photo and 3 G) in 50 patients. We also measured and characterized worst-case magnetic field emissions (MFE) from the wand (≤ 0. 4 μT), pacemaker (≤ 0. 004 μT), and iPod (≤ 0. 05 μT) during telemetry to understand the modulation techniques and safety protocols employed during data transmission. Telemetry interference (TI) manifested as high-frequency spikes (24. 4 %), blanking (17. 7 %) and interruption (22. 2 %), or delay (17. 6 %) in transmission with warning on programmer's screen. TI occurred in 25. 6 % of patients when the iPod was “on” and in 13 % even with the iPod turned “off. ” There were no inaccuracies in downlinked data when the downlink communication was successful. Wanded telemetry utilizes low-frequency (30 – 300 kHz) radiowaves and simple digital modulation techniques at relatively slow rates for “sequential” data transmission protected by a continuous “handshake. ” Emissions from iPods in that range interrupt the telemetry link but are too weak to cause pacemaker malfunction through corruption of vital data. Conclusion: Low-power MFE from iPods can produce interference with establishment and maintenance of a telemetry link and can cause TI with transmission of real time data, but because of continuous check protocols, do not corrupt the stored and vital downlink data.

A novel concept for ultra-wide-bandwidth suppression of SSN is proposed and implemented. This method consists of applying EBG cells with different stop bands creating noise isolation over a wide frequency region. The thesis starts with a general description of Power Distribution Network (PDN) of a PCB. It discusses the main challenges modern PCB designers are facing. Power and ground planes which are symmetric in shape and size create a resonating waveguide structure, an ideal path for SSN propagation. The mechanism of noise generation and propagation through the PDN and general approach of PDN noise reduction is discussed. Typically used methods include placement of EMI passives such as decoupling capacitors and ferrite beads and via stitching. The drawback of these methods is the limited frequency bandwidth they can cover, and the need to integrate additional components. Reduction of SSN noise by means of EBG was intensively studied over the last decades. However, most of the structures are effective only in a limited frequency band. Often they are embedded in a PCB as a separate layer or require extra vias which increase the manufacturing cost. In this work a new type of planar EBG structures was proposed as a means to avoid the generation and propagation of common-mode currents due to SSN in the power plane of PCBs, and thereby reducing their radiated emissions. The EBG also have beneficial effects on the differential-mode noise in PDN due to the SSN. To guide the design of EBGs for SSN reduction, several modelling techniques of the EBG structures based on results achieved with full-wave electromagnetic simulations by means of CST Microwave Studio and transmission matrix analysis are used. The dispersion diagram of the proposed EBG structure is validated by insertion loss measurements of the prototype boards. It was shown that a power plane structure is needed only locally for circuitry decoupling by creating a low impedance current path. The effect of different PDN designs such as power plane, power track and 2 single-cell EBG structures and different sized cells EBG on the noise reduction in PCB with active components was investigated. Some high permittivity materials were implemented as a PCB substrate to create a large power-ground plane capacitance, and its effectiveness to reduce EMI was investigated. Many researchers have investigated the effect of EBG using passive elements only. In this thesis not only the passive elements behaviour is discussed, but a design with active components was used too. The reduction in radiated electromagnetic fields and common mode currents of PCB with active components and various PDNs was studied. An equivalent circuit of active boards with a PDN was created with a SPICE circuit simulator. The proposed new EBG structure behaves as a wideband low pass filter reducing EMI. The key result of the work presented in this thesis is that by applying EBG structured power plane and supporting each individual electronic module on the board by its own power patch interconnected by - relatively- thin traces, instead of standard power ground plane couples which are identical and parallel to each other, can reduce SSN, common mode noise and radiated emission of the PCB...|$|R

Analysis of the simulation data was performed to create coverage profiles with the receiver settings at a deep space altitudes ranging from 2 million to 10 million km and a spherical grid resolution of 0. 25 degrees with respect to longitude and latitude. With the results of these simulations, two- and three-dimensional representations of the area without communication coverage and area with coverage were developed, showing {{the size and shape of}} the communication coverage gap projected in space. Also, the significance of this communication coverage gap is analyzed from the simulation data...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIonosphere is a {{dispersive}} medium that can strongly affect GPS and GALILEO signals. Ionospheric delay affecting the GPS and GALILEO pseudorange measurements is the larger source of ranging error, if left uncorrected. In addition, this perturbation {{is difficult to}} model and thus difficult to predict. A multi-frequency receiver can identify and correct errors induced by the ionosphere, as in the nominal case, two frequencies are sufficient to determine precisely the ionospheric delay. However, if affected by radio frequency interference, a receiver can lose one or more frequencies leading {{to the use of}} only one frequency to estimate ionospheric code delay. Therefore, it is felt by the authors as an important task to investigate techniques aimed at sustaining multi-frequency performance when a multiconstellation receiver installed in an aircraft is suddenly affected by <b>radiofrequency</b> <b>interference,</b> during critical phases of flight. The case of a loss of all but one frequency is studied in [Shau-Shiun Jan, 2003]. In this case, the usual code-carrier divergence technique is analyzed, consisting in computing the difference between the signal code and the carrier phase measurements. This difference is twice the ionospheric delay plus ambiguity plus errors, from which the ionospheric delay can be extracted. If a cycle slip occurs, the integer ambiguity appearing as a constant offset in the code-carrier difference causes this technique not to be valid. In the case of a single frequency receiver, a Kalman filter can be used to determine if a cycle slip occurs, introducing ambiguities of all satellites in view in the state vector as mentioned in [Lestarquit, 1995]. This Kalman filter can be initialized in the dual frequency mode, and left running when only one frequency is left. The aim of this paper is first to propose a method for single frequency ionospheric delay estimation after the loss of multiple frequency tracking, and also to analyse the performance of this method with regards to the civil aviation requirements. The proposed technique includes the detection of cycle slips...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Spatial and {{temporal}} resolutions {{are two of}} the most important features for quality assurance instrumentation of motion adaptive radiotherapy modalities. The goal of this work is to characterize the performance of the 2 D high spatial resolution monolithic silicon diode array named 2 ̆ 2 MagicPlate- 5122 ̆ 2 for quality assurance of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) combined with a dynamic multileaf collimator (MLC) tracking technique for motion compensation. Methods: MagicPlate- 512 is used in combination with the movable platform HexaMotion and a research version of radiofrequency tracking system Calypso driving MLC tracking software. The authors reconstruct 2 D dose distributions of small field square beams in three modalities: in static conditions, mimicking the temporal movement pattern of a lung tumor and tracking the moving target while the MLC compensates almost instantaneously for the tumor displacement. Use of Calypso in combination with MagicPlate- 512 requires a proper <b>radiofrequency</b> <b>interference</b> shielding. Impact of the shielding on dosimetry has been simulated by GEANT 4 and verified experimentally. Temporal and spatial resolutions of the dosimetry system allow also for accurate verification of segments of complex stereotactic radiotherapy plans with identification of the instant and location where a certain dose is delivered. This feature allows for retrospective temporal reconstruction of the delivery process and easy identification of error in the tracking or the multileaf collimator driving systems. A sliding MLC wedge combined with the lung motion pattern has been measured. The ability of the MagicPlate- 512 (MP 512) in 2 D dose mapping in all three modes of operation was benchmarked by EBT 3 film. Results: Full width at half maximum and penumbra of the moving and stationary dose profiles measured by EBT 3 film and MagicPlate- 512 confirm that motion has {{a significant impact on the}} dose distribution. Motion, no motion, and motion with MLC tracking profiles agreed within 1 and 0. 4 mm, respectively, for all field sizes tested.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} temporal behaviour of in situ and satellite-derived soil moisture data. The main objective is to evaluate the temporal reliability of the satellite products, comparing them with in situ data, for applications that would benefit {{from the use of}} consistent time series of soil moisture, such as studies on climate and hydrological cycle. The time series, seasonalities, and anomalies of Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) soil moisture and European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellite soil wetness index data sets were analysed over five test sites. The agreement of temporal behaviours and autocorrelation functions and the correlation with in situ data were investigated. A good agreement between the seasonalities of both satellite data sets and in situ data with high correlations (i. e. 0. 9) was found over the sites with a large soil moisture variability range and short vegetation cover. Noisier seasonalities were found over sites with small soil moisture variability ranges, affected by <b>radiofrequency</b> <b>interference</b> (RFI) and characterized by croplands. In spite of ERS soil moisture being characterized by a longer time series, the seasonality is much noisier than the AMSR-E products due to the numerous gaps in the data set. The correlation among the anomalies is lower than 0. 6, mainly due to the noise in the satellite products. However, the autocorrelation functions show that the anomalies are not random, although noisy. Although the stability of the anomaly correlograms is affected by the relatively short time series available for this study, the analysis shows that there are statistical similarities between the satellite soil moisture anomalies and the in situ data anomalies. The results show that AMSR-E and ERS products are consistent over long time periods and do contain useful information about soil moisture seasonality and anomaly behaviour, although they are affected by noise. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} results of the most {{sensitive}} search to date for the two 54 -MHz spectral lines of the hydroxyl (OH) molecule. These are the preliminary results of a larger, planned observational campaign. The splitting of the rotational ground state of the hydroxyl molecule gives rise to the four familiar 1. 7 -GHz transitions by which OH is known in the interstellar medium. There are also two magnetic-dipole transitions among these states at frequencies of 53. 2 MHz and 55. 1 MHz. These 54 -MHz transitions have never been detected astronomically. Because of the relative weakness of the magnetic-dipole emission process, it is expected that only maser emission will generate a detectable 54 -MHz signal. Two previous searches have been conducted by other authors with other instruments toward Galactic sources of known 1720 -MHz OH maser emission: three sources were searched at 55. 1 MHz and two other sources were searched at 53. 2 MHz, resulting in upper limits of approximately 30 Jy for spectral channels of 2 km/s in width. In preparation for our future observational campaign that will apply the unprecedented sensitivity of LOFAR to the search for 54 -MHz OH emission, we conducted a pilot project using six hours of Commissioning Time. These observations employed 21 48 -element stations and produced a spectral resolution of approximately 0. 5 km/s for both the 53. 2 - and 55. 1 -MHz lines. This spectral resolution is a considerable improvement over previous searches since it is suitable both for resolving the characteristically narrow width of maser lines and for identifying <b>radiofrequency</b> <b>interference.</b> In our pilot observations, no emission was detected at either frequency with an upper limit of approximately 3 Jy. We observed the Galactic sources W 75 N and W 3 (OH), neither of which have been searched previously at either frequency. We discuss the astrophysical implications of these sensitive non-detections.

40|$|Radiofrequency {{spectrum}} is a finite resource {{that consists of}} the frequencies in the range 3 kHz to 300 GHz. It is used for wireless communication and supports several applications and services. Whether {{it is at the}} personal, community or society level, and whether it is for applications in consumer electronics, building management, smart utility networks, intelligent driving systems, the Internet of Things, industrial automation and so on, the demand for wireless communication is increasing continuously. Together with this increase in demand, there is an increase in the quality of service requirements in terms of throughput, and the reliability and availability of wireless services. Industrial wireless sensor networks, for example, operate in environments that are usually harsh and time varying. The frequency spectrum that is utilised by industrial wireless protocols such as WirelessHART and ISA 100. 11 a, is also used by many other wireless technologies, and with wireless applications growing rapidly, it is possible that multiple heterogeneous wireless systems will need to operate in overlapping spatiotemporal regions in the future. Increased <b>radiofrequency</b> <b>interference</b> affects connectivity and reduces communication link quality. This affects reliability and latency negatively, both of which are core quality service requirements. Getting multiple heterogeneous radio systems to co-exist harmoniously in shared {{spectrum is}} challenging. Traditionally, this has been achieved by granting network operators exclusive rights that allow them to access parts of the spectrum assigned to them and hence the problems of co-existence and limited spectrum could be ignored. Design time multi-access techniques have also been used. At present, however, it has become necessary to use spectrum more efficiently, to facilitate the further growth of wireless communication. This can be achieved in a number of ways. Firstly, the policy that governs the regulation of radiofrequency spectrum must be updated to accommodate flexible, dynamic spectrum access. Secondly, new techniques for multiple-access and spectrum sharing should be devised. A revolutionary new communication paradigm is required, and one such paradigm has recently emerged in the form of Cognitive Radio technology. Traditional methods to sharing spectrum assume that radios in a wireless network work together in an unchanging environment. Cognitive radios, on the other hand, can sense, learn and adapt. In cognitive radio networks, the interactions between users are taken into account, in order for adjustments to be made to suit the prevailing radio environment. In this thesis, the problem of spectrum scarcity and coexistence is addressed using cognitive radio techniques, to ensure more efficient use of radio-frequency spectrum. An introduction to cognitive radio networks is given, covering cognitive radio fundamentals, spectrum sensing, dynamic spectrum management, game theoretic approaches to spectrum sharing and security in cognitive radio networks. A focus is placed on wireless industrial networks as a challenging test case for cognitive radio. A study on spectrum management policy is conducted, together with an investigation into the current state of radio-frequency spectrum utilisation, to uncover real and artificial cases of spectrum scarcity. A novel cognitive radio protocol is developed together with an open source test bed for it. Finally, a game theoretic dynamic spectrum access algorithm is developed that can provide scalable, fast convergence spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networks. This work is a humble contribution to the advancement of wireless communication. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.

40|$|HE 9 th Specialist Meeting on Microwave Radiometry and Remote Sensing Applications (MicroRad ’ 06) {{was held}} from February 28 to March 3, 2006, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, a Commonwealth of the USA. The conference was chaired by Dr. Steven Reising of Colorado State University, Fort Collins, {{and the local}} {{organizing}} chair was Dr. Sandra Cruz-Pol of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez. The objective of MicroRad ’ 06 was to provide an open forum to report and discuss recent advances {{in the field of}} microwave radiometry and to gather all parties, including the research, industrial, and academic communities, who are involved in projects and studies in microwave radiometry of the land, oceans, and atmosphere. The meeting was highly successful, with 125 participants from 15 countries, 146 submitted abstracts, 80 oral presentations, and 50 interactive posters during four full days of sessions. MicroRad ’ 06 is the most recent in a series of meetings focusing on Microwave Radiometry and Remote Sensing of the Environment, dating back to 1983 when the first MicroRad meeting was organized and hosted by the late Prof. Giovanni d’Auria of the University “La Sapienza” of Rome, Italy. An In Memoriam article for Prof. d’Auria appeared on p. 8 of the IEEE GRSS Newsletter, Issue # 142, March 2007. The second MicroRad meeting was held in Florence, Italy, organized and chaired by Dr. Paolo Pampaloni at Istituto di Ricerca sulle Onde Elettromagnetiche, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche. Since then, MicroRad meetings have been held approximately every 2 1 / 2 years, alternating between the USA and Italy. Previous MicroRad meetings in the USA were held in Boulder, CO (1992 and 2001), and in Boston, MA (1996). The MicroRad meetings in Italy were convened in Rome at “La Sapienza” (1983 and 2004) and at “Tor Vergata” (1994), as well as in Florence (1988 and 1999). The technical program of MicroRad ’ 06 opened with a session on microwave radiometer calibration, featuring presentations on current and planned radiometer systems by representatives of government agencies, industry, and universities. The focus on sensors continued with a session devoted to instru- Digital Object Identifier 10. 1109 /TGRS. 2007. 900318 mentation and advanced techniques and one on <b>radiofrequency</b> <b>interference</b> (RFI) mitigation. The first day concluded with a session on experimental campaigns, which included airborne and ground-based measurements as well as calibration and validation of spaceborne sensors. The second day shifted to consideration of science application areas, which began with a session on soil moisture and salinity satellite missions at L-band. This was followed by sessions focusing on ocean wind, sea ice, electromagnetic modeling of the sea surface, and snow cover. The morning of the third day focused on land surfaces with sessions on snow cover, soil moisture, vegetation, and electromagnetic modeling of microwave emission from the land and the cryosphere. On the afternoon of the third day, the emphasis shifted to weather and the atmosphere, starting with two sessions on retrieval methodologies and radiance assimilation. These included four presentations from government laboratories {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic to highlight rapid advances in numerical weather prediction and direct applications of satellite radiances. Finally, the fourth and final day of MicroRad ’ 06 focused on atmospheric remote sensing, which emphasized temperature and humidity in the morning and clouds and precipitation in the afternoon, including many presentations on ground-based techniques and sensor design. At the conclusion of each of the 16 oral sessions of MicroRad ’ 06, the co-chairs introduced the poster papers on the topic of the session. The long coffee breaks each morning and afternoon provided plenty of time for discussion with poster presenters, which gave the conference the distinctive academic flavor typical of MicroRad meetings...|$|E
