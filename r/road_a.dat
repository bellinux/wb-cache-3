5|$|Highway 35, {{like many}} {{highways}} that begin at Lake Ontario and eventually cross into the Canadian Shield, began as several trails connecting settlements. Most {{of the southern}} portion of the highway follows various sidelines and concessions. Between Lindsay and Fenelon Falls, Highway 35 follows the former Fenelon Road, while north of there it follows The Cameron <b>Road,</b> <b>a</b> trail carved in the 1850s between Fenelon and Minden. North of Minden, the highway generally follows The Bobcaygeon <b>Road,</b> <b>a</b> colonization road built {{as far north as}} Dwight in the 1850s.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this paper, we {{describe}} the simulation of the traffic flow on <b>a</b> <b>road</b> with <b>a</b> construction zone. The simulation model {{is based on the}} cellular automata and the stochastic velocity model. The simulation results on <b>a</b> <b>road</b> with <b>a</b> construction zone are compared with them on <b>a</b> <b>road</b> without <b>a</b> construction zone. Although the analytical study indicates that the traffic flow on <b>a</b> <b>road</b> with <b>a</b> construction zone depends only on the number of the available lanes, the simulation results shows that the traffic flow depends on, in addition to the number of the available lanes, the length of the construction zone and the place of a constructed lane...|$|R

5|$|Although its {{population}} had dropped below a thousand {{by the late}} 1920s, in 1927 the state replaced the stage road with what eventually became Highway 82. Unlike the stage road, it was closed during the winter months. While most of the old route {{was used for the}} new <b>road,</b> <b>a</b> portion of the original grade remains three miles below the pass on the east side. It includes the foundation of the gatekeeper's house and the remains of the gate.|$|E

5|$|Due to an archaic law in Erie County, {{the town}} of Tonawanda and {{the town of}} Amherst, who {{completed}} the road in 1925, were requested in 1935 to take over $2million (1935USD) in debts bonded for its construction. The county noted that the towns' inability to pay for the road made the new <b>road</b> <b>a</b> financial burden for the county. To make things worse, the new road did not bring the immediate influx of business that was advertised and was looking early on as a giant mistake {{on the part of the}} county and towns.|$|E
5|$|Everton {{moved to}} nearby Anfield <b>Road,</b> <b>a</b> site where proper covered stands were built. Everton {{played at the}} Anfield ground from 1884 until 1892.

Anfield's capacity grew to over 20,000 and the club hosted an international match between England and Ireland. During their time at Anfield, Everton became the first club to introduce goalnets to professional football.|$|E
5|$|For proper {{protection}} of the wood turtle,in-depth land surveys of its habitat to establish population numbers are needed. One emerging solution to the highway mortality problem, which primarily affects nesting females, is the construction of under-road channels. These tunnels allow the wood turtle to pass under the <b>road,</b> <b>a</b> solution that helps prevent accidental deaths. Brochures and other media that warn people to avoid keeping the wood turtle as a pet are currently being distributed. Next, leaving nests undisturbed, especially common nesting sites and populations, is the best solution to enable the wood turtle's survival.|$|E

The route continues north past more residences before it leaves Mardela Springs and heads into farmland {{a short distance}} west of the Delaware border. It continues through a mix of woods and farms with some residences before reaching Sharptown. Here, the road intersects unsigned MD 813F (Twiford Road).
