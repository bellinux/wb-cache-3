5|$|To {{progress}} through the game, the player must venture through six large levels interconnected by a hub area. In each level, the player must complete multiple objectives and then exit the level via a portal. Objectives range from destroying objects to rescuing hostages and defeating enemies, among others. Upon exiting a level, the player must either protect a totem from enemy forces or defeat a boss, or both, depending on which level the player was; the first three levels <b>require</b> <b>the</b> player to protect a totem, {{the fourth and fifth}} levels <b>require</b> <b>the</b> player to protect a totem and then defeat a boss, and the last level requires the player to defeat a boss. The game features an automap to help players navigate through the levels.|$|E

5|$|A change {{occurred}} {{in the game and}} the role of the goalkeeper in the 1880s, when the Scottish reduced the size of the scoring area by placing rugby posts, spaced about 10 feet apart, at each end of the pool. At the same time, the rules were changed to allow goalkeepers to stand on the pool deck and leap onto the head of an opposing player who approached the goal. This change in the rules was brief. To prevent the serious injuries that resulted from this method of goalkeeping, the rules were revised again to <b>require</b> <b>the</b> goalie to remain in the water.|$|E
5|$|A further type of {{committee}} is normally {{set up to}} scrutinise private bills submitted to the Scottish Parliament by an outside party or promoter {{who is not a}} member of the Scottish Parliament or Scottish Government.

Private Bill Committees have been set up to consider legislation on issues such as the development of the Edinburgh Tram Network, the Glasgow Airport Rail Link, the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link and extensions to the National Gallery of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court which commands a public body to perform a public duty, and is usually employed to compel public bodies to exercise the powers given to them.

A person who complies with a mandatory order cannot have legal proceedings taken against him or her for doing so.|$|E

50|$|This game also {{contains}} a Sugoroku mini-game as an additional feature. Up to four players can participate in this mode, and each player has to choose a character. The game's goal is to collect the requested amount of gold (depending on the player's settings). At {{the beginning of the}} game, three flags for each player will be divided in the map, and players can earn gold and raise their ranks by collecting their respective flags and returning to their home square. Additionally, a player can buy territories on the map, or challenge another player for the control of a territory. There are six types of challenges in <b>the</b> game: Annihilate (<b>requires</b> <b>the</b> players to defeat as many enemies as possible), Chase (<b>requires</b> <b>the</b> players to defeat as many fleeing Fire Ninjas as possible), Destroy (<b>requires</b> <b>the</b> players to destroy as many boulders as possible), Race (<b>requires</b> <b>the</b> players to break through the doors to reach the end before the opponent does), Reveal (<b>requires</b> <b>the</b> players to uncover as many Sky Ninjas as possible), and Steal (<b>requires</b> <b>the</b> players to collect as much gold as possible).|$|R

5|$|Although every {{university}} in Australia accepts the IB diploma, entry criteria differ from university to university.
