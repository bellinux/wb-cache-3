40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} the interaction between technology adoption and incomplete enforcement on the extent of violations and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> technology adoption. We focus on price-based and quantity-based emission regulations. First, we show that in contrast to uniform taxes, under tradable emissions permits (TEPs), the fall in permit price produced by technology adoption reduces the benefits of violating the environmental regulation at the margin and leads firms to modify their compliance behavior. Moreover, when TEPs are used, the deterrent effect of the monitoring effort is reinforced by the effect that technology adoption has on the extent of violations. Second, we show that the regulator may speed up the diffusion of new technologies by increasing the stringency of the enforcement strategy in the case of TEPs while in the case of uniform taxes, the rate of adoption does not depend on the enforcement parameters...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the timing of}} the use of biological carbon sequestration and its capacity to alleviate the carbon constraint on the energy sector. We constructed a stochastic optimal control model balancing the costs of fossil emission abatement, the opportunity costs of lands allocated to afforestation, and the costs of uncertain climate damages. We show that a minor part of the sequestration potential should start immediately as a "brake" slowing down both the rate of growth of concentrations and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> in the energy sector, thus increasing the option value of the emission trajectories. But, most of the potential is put in reserve {{to be used as a}} "safety valve" after the resolution of uncertainty, if a higher and faster decarbonization is required: sequestration cuts off the peaks of costs of fossil abatement and postpones the pivoting of the energy system by up to two decades.

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to accurately predict the impacts of policies for control of nonpoint-source pollution because analytical frameworks incorporating agent heterogeneity are rare. This paper overcomes this limitation through describing a new framework in which the behaviour of individual firms is explicitly represented by large, complex models calibrated to baseline information. Disaggregation allows the simulation of policies that require uniform reductions in pollutant load or those that allow different <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> between firms to achieve a given nutrient target at least cost, as with the trading of pollution entitlements. The reduction of nitrate leaching from intensive dairy production in a catchment of the Waikato River in New Zealand is used as an illustrative application. It is highlighted that satisfaction of water-quality standards will incur substantial costs within this region. Overall, the framework is notable for its integration of multiple modelling techniques from diverse disciplines and its focus on the behaviour of individual agents.

Sustainable development, including its economic, environmental and social elements, is a key goal of decisionmakers. Optimal economic growth {{has also been a}} crucial goal of both development theorists and practitioners. This paper examines the conditions under which optimal growth might be sustainable, by assessing {{the costs and benefits of}} growth. Key environmental and social aspects are considered. The Ecol-Opt-Growth- 1 model analyses economic–ecological interactions, including resource depletion, pollution, irreversibility, other environmental effects, and uncertainty. It addresses some important issues, including savings, investment, technical progress, substitutability of productive factors, intergenerational efficiency, equity, and policies to make economic growth more sustainable—a basic element of the sustainomics framework. The empirical results support growing concerns that costs of growth may outweigh its benefits, resulting in unsustainability. Basically, in a wide range of circumstances, long term economic growth is unsustainable due to increasing environmental damage. Nevertheless, the model has many options that can be explored by policy makers, to make the development path more sustainable, as advocated by sustainomics. One example suggests that government supported abatement programs are needed to move towards sustainable development, since the model runs without abatement were infeasible. The optimal <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> increases over time. Abatement of pollution is necessary to improve ecosystem viability and increase sustainability. Further research is necessary to seek conditions under which alternative economic growth paths are likely to become sustainable. <br /...|$|E

Simultaneously, electrolytic gases (H 2) {{are generated}} at the cathode. Aluminum and iron materials are usually used as anodes, {{the dissolution of}} which produces hydroxides and polymeric hydroxides. These coagulants are able to destabilize colloidal suspensions and emulsions, to adsorb, neutralize, or precipitate dissolved polluting species, and finally to form flocs that can be removed either by settling or flotation. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effects of the operating parameters, such as initial pH, initial concentration (C 0), residence time (τ), current density (j), and inlet flow rate (Q), on the removal of a red nylosan dye by EC process using aluminum electrodein a continuous electrochemical reactor. FTIR analysis was conducted to interpret the functional groups involved during the EC process. It was found that the increase in the current density up to 100 A m− 2 had increased the dye removal efficiency and the optimum inlet flow rate for EC process was the minimum at 15 L h− 1 and it has increased the electrical energy consumption. A <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> of about 90 % for turbidity and 97 % for color was observed, when the initial concentration of the dye C 0 was lower than 300 mg L− 1, current density j= 300 A m− 2, conductivity κ= 2. 54 mS cm− 1, inlet flow rate Q= 15 Lh− 1, residence Time τ= 35 min, and initial pH ranged from 2. 3 to 8. 8.

40|$|Marine {{ecosystems}} are severely affected by water pollution originating from coastal catchments, while these {{ecosystems are}} of vital importance from an environmental {{as well as}} an economic perspective. To warrant sustainable economic development of coastal regions, we need to balance the marginal costs from coastal catchment water pollution abatement and the associated marginal benefits from marine resource appreciation. Water pollution abatement costs are, however, not equal across industries and, consequently, the question arises to what extent marine water quality improvement can efficiently be pursued across industries. In this paper we develop an optimal control approach to explore, analytically as well as quantitatively, social welfare maximizing <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> water pollution <b>abatement</b> across industries. For a case study of Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN) water pollution in the Great Barrier Reef region of Australia, water pollution abatement cost functions for two agricultural industries are estimated to, in turn, explore social welfare maximizing <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> water pollution <b>abatement</b> per industry. Results for the Tully-Murray catchment show that DIN water pollution can be reduced by about 25 % through the adoption of win-win management practices in the sugarcane industry. However, when taking into account the benefits from reduced DIN water pollution in the downstream marine environment, this study shows that maximum social welfare gains can be obtained by reducing DIN water pollution through a reduction in the agricultural production area in combination with the adoption of lose-win management practices in the sugarcane as well as the grazing industry...|$|R

In this paper we develop a deterministic optimal control approach to explore private and social welfare maximizing <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> water pollution <b>abatement</b> in linked catchment and freshwater/coastal socioecological systems. For {{a case study of}} the Minho region (Iberian Peninsula), we estimate nation-specific water pollution abatement cost functions (based on management practice adoption) to determine and compare private (national) and social (trans-national) welfare maximizing <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> water pollution <b>abatement.</b> Results show that some private (national) welfare gains can be obtained through adoption of win-win practices, leading to a 12 % reduction in the annual <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> water pollution and a 7 % increase in annual regional income.

The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) is the Australian Government preferred instrument in reducing greenhouse gas emissions for all sectors. It is projected that the CPRS will address the market failure of not factoring the cost of greenhouse gas emissions into the price of goods and services. In terms of road transport, it is proposed that a CPRS would be applied to fuel producers on the basis of their fuel sales, increasing fuel prices and providing the necessary price signal for behavioural change and encourage the use of renewable energy in road transport and investment in fuel efficiency technology. While in the European Union (EU) transport was not included in their Emission Trading Scheme. The paper examines whether the scheme would be effective in encouraging behavioural change in reducing the growth of road transport emissions, and comparatively examines how the European Union ETS model treats the transport sector compared to the Australian CPRS.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 This dissertation's three essays {{explore the}} {{effects of climate change}} on land use changes in the U. S., how future land areas in all major land uses change by {{projecting}} land use at the regional scale under two IPCC climate change scenarios. Investigate how and what role should carbon sequestration plays as a mitigation strategy given uncertainty of climate impacts and, estimate how responsive the demand for and the supply of urban land is to changes in its price and how different climatic variables effect both the supply and the demand for urban land. The first essay uses an econometric model to project regional and national landuse changes in the U. S. under two IPCC climate change scenarios. The key driver of land-use change in the model is county-level measures of net returns to five major land uses. The net returns are modified for the IPCC scenarios according to assumed trends in population and income and projections from integrated assessment models of agricultural prices and agricultural and forestry yields. For both scenarios, we project large increases in urban land {{by the middle of the}} century, while the largest declines are in cropland area. Significant differences among regions in the projected patterns of land-use change are evident, including an expansion of forests in the Mountain and Plains regions with declines elsewhere. Comparisons to projections with no climate change effects on prices and yields reveal relatively small differences. Thus, our findings suggest that future land use patterns in the U. S. will be shaped largely by urbanization, with climate change having a relatively small influence. The second essay explores the optimal time path of carbon sequestration and carbon abatement in stabilizing CO₂ levels under uncertainty of climate impacts. We question the conventional wisdom that carbon sequestration should be used as a near term strategy by recognizing the fact that sequestration, unlike abatement, can actually remove CO₂ from the atmosphere. Two related models are examined: a deterministic fixed end point and finite time horizon model and a two-period sequential decision making model. In the latter, uncertainty regard the stabilization level of the atmospheric stock is resolved prior to the decision on how much to control the stock in the second period. Present value costs <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> and sequestration are minimized subject to two state variables; the level of CO₂ stock in the atmosphere and the stock of suitable land that can be converted to forestland. Both models show that carbon sequestration may play an important role in climate change mitigation under certain conditions. In addition, the stochastic model finds that an increase in the variability of climate impacts results in higher <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> today while leaving some sequestration capacity as a safety value for the future. In the third essay, a structural model of the demand for and the supply of urban land is estimated using panel data on 3032 counties in the contiguous U. S for the four time periods 1982, 1987, 1992 and, 1997. A two-step estimation procedure is applied. In the first step, fixed effects and time-varying variables are used to estimate the structural system of demand and supply equations via Two-Stage Least Squares (2 SLS) procedure. This yields consistent estimates of the structural equations' parameters. The model is then extended to a hierarchical linear model. The contribution of observed time-invariant variables in explaining counties fixed effects is investigated. Among these variables are climatic and geographical variables that are assumed to affect both the supply and the demand for urban land, though in potentially different ways. Results suggest inelastic supply and demand at the national and regional levels with the exception of an elastic demand in the West region. Examined climatic and geographical variables are found to have significant effects on both the supply of and the demand for urban land...|$|R

40|$|The {{estimation}} of the optimal charges/taxes on environmental disruption and the financing of the spending on the <b>abatement</b> <b>of</b> environmental disruption are important practical problems. This paper shows that, for most cases where some abatement is desirable, both the estimation and the financing problems may be easily solved. It is desirable to charge disruption (at least) at the marginal cost <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> (which is easier to estimate than the marginal damage of disruption) and such a charge will normally yield total revenue {{in excess of the}} amount <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> spending.

40|$|We analyse the {{international}} {{aspects of the}} greenhouse problem. The equity versus efficiency trade-off is examined by reducing the set of instruments to the allocation <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> efforts over countries {{without the possibility of}} side payments. The traditional cost-effective allocation <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> efforts is no longer necessarily optimal. The trade-off is illustrated empirically by combining the available cost and benefit estimates in a simplified two-period model with 12 regions in the world. In a second application we follow an inverse optimum approach and compute the power weights implicit in actuel agreements. status: publishe...|$|R

Relying on disaggregated source data and using engineering cost functions and various technical and economic assumptions, the least cost curves <b>of</b> sulphur <b>abatement</b> for all the European countries have been derived and some examples are presented. Finally, a sensitivity analysis <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> strategies and costs to some alternative assumptions about energy futures is presented...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} combining an international cap-and-trade scheme with national carbon taxes. We consider a two-country stochastic partial equilibrium model with log-normally distributed uncertainty. The situation {{is analogous to the}} situation where European countries impose national carbon taxes in addition to the EU emissions trading. The allowance price in the joint cap-and-trade scheme depends on the tax rate, the relative size <b>of</b> countries and <b>abatement</b> options, the magnitude of uncertainty, and correlation <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> costs. In most cases, the additional tax will not lead to additional production of the public good beyond the fixed targets. The additional tax results in higher costs <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> to the country introducing the additional tax, and higher costs overall...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the cost structure <b>of</b> emissions <b>abatement</b> through {{different types of}} Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects. Alternative models for abatement costs are specified and estimated using CDM project-specific data. Empirical results indicate that there exist economies of scale in emission abatement through the CDM projects, and that the marginal cost <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> significantly varies across different types of projects. The distribution of various CDM project types corresponds to the relative attractiveness of the types, {{in terms of the}} structure of the estimated marginal cost function. Thus, empirical results suggest that the CDM market operates efficiently and sends the right signals to the investors, which further explains the shying away from costly carbon sequestration projects funded by many international development agencies, such as the World Bank. Contrary to the hypothesis that that the marginal costs <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> through CDM decrease over time due to experience or learning by doing, empirical results show non-decreasing marginal cost <b>of</b> <b>abatement</b> over time. This finding suggests that there may be other incentives to invest in certain types of CDM projects in specific locations, thus implying location-specificity of various investment opportunities. While non-decreasing marginal cost o...|$|R
