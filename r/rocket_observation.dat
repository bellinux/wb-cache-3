In this document we describe the specific scientific background and motivations for this Venus EUV <b>rocket</b> <b>observation</b> along with experiment design and mission parameters...|$|E
30|$|Here, {{we should}} {{emphasize}} the practicality of the plasma diagnosis from the sheath capacitance. In <b>rocket</b> <b>observations,</b> instruments sometimes fail to measure plasma parameters due to artificial interferences. Analysis of the sheath capacitance {{in addition to}} the UHR frequency will contribute to improvement of the success rate of plasma measurements.|$|R
40|$|Future {{projects}} for the Antarctic <b>rocket</b> <b>observations</b> are discussed with regard to two dynamical problems on polar upper atmosphere and polar ionosphere.

40|$|A <b>rocket</b> <b>observation</b> of {{nitric oxide}} {{in the lower}} {{thermosphere}} {{during a time of}} high solar activity is compared to the results of calculations from a one-dimensional photochemical model. A solar soft X-ray flux of 0. 75 erg/sq cm/s is needed to explain the observed NO densities.

40|$|Two <b>rocket</b> <b>observations</b> of {{very soft}} X-ray diffuse {{intensity}} show three emission regions of large angular extent.

40|$|<b>Rocket</b> <b>observations</b> of far-ultraviolet {{terrestrial}} airglow {{emissions in}} the 1230 - to 1450 -A band at night {{have been carried out}} from White Sands Missile Range. Three rockets carried 15. 4 -cm-diam far-ultraviolet telescopes to about 220 km altitude at various times during the night from postsunset to predawn. Postsunset and predawn observations were made when the solar zenith angle at the conjugate ionosphere was about 95 deg, and in both cases positive identification of strong O I 1304 -A emissions was made. Evidence that in these cases the 1356 / 1304 intensity ratio was less than 0. 2 is presented. Observations made well into the night yielded only an upper limit to the combined O I 1304 - and 1356 -A emissions of 20 Rayleighs, consistent with previous observations and theoretical calculations. These results show that meaningful <b>rocket</b> <b>observations</b> of the cosmic far ultraviolet background can be made only when the solar zenith angle at the conjugate ionosphere of the launch site is larger than 105 deg or if atomic oxygen emission lines are excluded from the detectors' bandpass...|$|R
40|$|After a brief {{comment on}} the recent {{progress}} in the morphological study of substorm, it is stated that <b>rocket</b> <b>observations</b> must be conducted {{in connection with the}} study of synoptic auroral features. The observation of O_ 2 IR Atmospheric (0, 0) 1. 27 Î¼ is especially important as a target of synthetic researches on magneto-ionospheric coupling. Finally, the aurora monitoring at for rocket position by an automatic TV camera is recommended as an enhanced ground observation during the flight...|$|R

40|$|A sealed Ti window {{proportional}} counter sensitive to X radiation {{in the energy}} range 0. 35 - 0. 45 keV and above 1. 5 keV is described. Measurements of the Ti mass absorption coefficients and a graphical summary of the literature values are presented. For a {{proportional counter}} with a 930 microgram/sq cm (2. 1 -micron) Ti window, the peak efficiency at 0. 45 keV is found to lie between 4. 6 % and 7. 1 %.

Comparison with measurements made in May 1982 shows no changes within the absolute errors of the experiment. Comparison with measurements made during solar maximum in 1979 and 1980 indicates a large decrease in the absolute solar irradiance at wavelengths below 190 nm.

40|$|A {{sensitive}} spectrograph for <b>rocket</b> <b>observations</b> {{of celestial}} {{objects in the}} 910 - 1250 A band is described. The instrument incorporates {{a variety of new}} technologies that allow unprecedented sensitivity in this difficult, but scientifically rewarding, band. It includes a diamond-turned Wolter-Schwarzschild Type II telescope, a conventional Rowland Circle spectrograph, and resistive anode/microchannel plate detectors.

40|$|<b>Rocket</b> <b>observations</b> of {{the extreme}} {{ultraviolet}} spectrum of the aurora from 550 to 1250 A are presented, and {{the results for the}} O I (989 A) and O I (1027 A) multiplets are examined in detail. The intensity of these emissions and the observed anisotropic radiation field are inconsistent with the relative intensity of the branching radiations. Several possible solutions to the problem are discussed, and evidence is presented that suggests the need to lower the branching ratios by several orders of magnitude...|$|R
40|$|<b>Rocket</b> <b>observations</b> and {{spectra of}} the dayglow {{spectrum}} of the terrestrial atmosphere between 840 and 1860 A are studied. Three bands of the N 2 c-prime 4 system are seen clearly resolved in the dayglow. Analysis of high-resolution N 2 Lyman-Birge-Hopfield data shows no anomalous vibrational distribution as has been reported from other observations. Altitude profiles of the observed O and N 2 emissions demonstrate that the MSIS- 83 model O and N 2 densities are appropriate for {{the conditions of the}} rocket flights...|$|R
40|$|A <b>rocket</b> <b>observation</b> of Sirius in the far-UV region from 912 to 1240 A is reported. It {{is found}} {{that only a few}} counts were {{detected}} which can possibly be attributed to the hydrogen-rich white dwarf Sirius B. An upper limit of 2. 0 by 10 to the - 10 th power erg/sq cm per sec/A on the Sirius B flux in the range from 1000 to 1080 A is established with 99. 3 % confidence. This upper limit is shown to constrain the model-dependent effective temperature of Sirius B to be less than or approximately 27, 000 K. It is concluded that the observed X-ray flux from Sirius cannot be emitted by the photosphere of Sirius B...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} is proposed for specifically determining the relative solar coronal abundance of neon and magnesium. The relative abundance is calculated {{directly from the}} relative intensity of the resonance lines of Ne X (12. 134 A) and Mg XI (9. 169 A) {{without the need for}} the development of a detailed model of the thermal structure of the corona. Moderate resolution Bragg crystal spectrometer results from the OVI- 10 satellite were used to determine a coronal neon to magnesium relative abundance of 1. 47 + or - 0. 38. The application of this technique to a recent higher resolution <b>rocket</b> <b>observation</b> gave an abundance ratio of approximately 0. 93 + or - 0. 15...|$|E
40|$|At present, {{there are}} a great number of radio meteor, {{ionosphere}} and <b>rocket</b> <b>observation</b> data for the altitude range of 80 to 100 km which indicate the existence of large scale circulation systems in the mesopause to low thermosphere range which change regularly with season and latitude. But the existing observation network and observation programs are not optimal for revealing the main factors forming the circulation mode at these altitudes. A generalized optimum monitoring mathematical model is offered for consideration. The model input data are distribution density, response function, individual measurement root mean square uncertainty and detection effectiveness function. The model makes it possible to obtain the observation distribution density, the minimal possible dispersion and optimized system effectiveness...|$|E

Through the late seventies, {{there were about}} twenty successful balloon flights. These balloon surveys led {{to the discovery of}} five new X-ray sources, whose spectra were very different from the X-ray sources discovered during <b>rocket</b> <b>observations.</b> The X-ray flux of these sources were variable. Among them was GX 1+4 whose X-ray flux appeared to be periodic with a period of about 2.4 minutes. This was the discovery of the first slowly rotating neutron star.|$|R
40|$|Altitude {{profiles}} of the O(+) 834 -A emission, obtained from <b>rocket</b> <b>observations</b> at moderate and high solar conditions, are compared with model calculations. The model showed that when viewing the atmosphere horizontally at altitudes below the F 2 layer, the 834 -A intensity was virtually independent of the O(+) density. The 834 -A intensity {{was found to be}} highly sensitive to the N 2 absorption cross section.

40|$|Observations, {{obtained}} with the Voyager ultraviolet spectrometers, are presented of absolute fluxes for two well-known hot subluminous stars: BD + 28 deg 4211, an sdO, and G 191 - B 2 B, a hot DA white dwarf. Complete absolute energy distributions {{for these two}} stars, from the Lyman limit at 912 A to 1 micron, are given. For BD + 28 deg 4211, a single power law closely represents the entire observed energy distribution. For G 191 - B 2 B, a pure hydrogen model atmosphere provides an excellent match to the entire absolute energy distribution. Voyager absolute fluxes are discussed in relation to those reported from various sounding rocket experiments, including a recent <b>rocket</b> <b>observation</b> of BD + 28 deg 4211...|$|E
40|$|Sounding rocket {{measurements}} {{conducted in}} 1988 under high solar activity conditions {{revealed that the}} intensity of thermospheric OI emissions at 98. 9 nm present an anomalous vertical profile, showing exospheric intensities much higher than expected from radiative transfer model results, which included the known sources of excited oxygen. All attempts based on modeling of the photochemical processes and radiative transfer were unable {{to account for the}} higher than predicted brightnesses. More recently, the SOHO-SUMER instrument measured the UV solar flux at high spectral resolution, revealing the importance of a significant additional source of oxygen emission at 98. 9 nm that had not been accounted for before. In this study, we simulate the radiative transfer of the OI- 98. 9 nm multiplet, including the photochemical sources of excited oxygen, the resonant scattering of solar photons, and the effects of non-thermal atoms, i. e. a population of fast-moving oxygen atoms in excess of the Maxwellian distribution. Including resonance scattering of the 98. 9 nm solar multiplet, we find good agreement with the previous sounding <b>rocket</b> <b>observation.</b> The inclusion of a nonthermal oxygen population with a consistent increase of the total density produces a larger intensity at high altitude that apparently better accounts for the observation, but such a correction cannot be demonstrated given the uncertainties of the observations. A good agreement between model and sounding <b>rocket</b> <b>observation</b> is also found with the triplet at 130. 4 nm. We further investigate the radiative transfer of the OI- 98. 9 nm multiplet, and the oxygen emissions at 130. 4 and 135. 6 nm using observations from the STP 78 - 1 satellite. We find a less satisfying agreement between the model and the STP 78 - 1 data that can be accounted for by scaling the modelled intensity within a range acceptable given the uncertainties on the STP 78 - 1 absolute calibration.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{interstellar}} extinction from 950 to 1180 A {{in the direction}} of Rho Oph. These data were obtained with a moderate-resolution sounding <b>rocket</b> <b>observation</b> of Ro Oph, and two lightly reddened B stars of identical spectral type. Unlike Voyager observations in this wavelength region, our spectral resolution is sufficient to directly measure the contribution of molecular hydrogen along the line of sight and unambiguously identify the dust contribution. The derived curves compare favorably with the extrapolation of functional fits to the Rho Oph derived from longer wavelengths. In addition, we have fitted a model of dust extinction to the derived curve and find that the best fits indicate that the line of sight exhibits a larger than average grain size and a preferential concentration of graphite relative to silicates. The sharp rise seen at the shortest wavelengths (below 1000 A) cannot be explained by standard silicate-graphite dust models and may be indicative of a nonstandard grain shape or a missing component in the extinction models...|$|E
