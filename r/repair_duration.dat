40|$|The {{distribution}} system {{is part of}} the electric power system that links the bulk transmission system and the individual customers. Approximately 80 percent of outages experienced by the customers are due to failures in the {{distribution system}}. It is therefore important to understand the impact of the outages on the customer outage costs and the system reliability. This thesis evaluates various analytical and simulation techniques which incorporate varying degrees of complexity and data to evaluate the expected customer costs at the system and load level of a radial distribution system. A computer program based on time sequential Monte Carlo simulation has been developed. The results show that certain analytical techniques provide as accurate results as using a Monte Carlo simulation technique. This research work then analyzes the effect of <b>repair</b> <b>duration</b> distributions on the expected customer costs and the system and reliability indices including annual outage duration at the load points using Monte Carlo simulation technique. Certain <b>repair</b> <b>duration</b> distributions caused expected customer outage costs to increase by 30 % for the system and over 50 % at certain load points. Some reliability indices were also directly affected by the application of <b>repair</b> <b>duration</b> distribution. This research work thus provides a basic guide to the difference in the expected costs and reliability indices when choosing a particular technique and the type of <b>repair</b> <b>duration</b> distribution...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the probability of}} data loss, or equivalently, the reliability function for an erasure coded distributed data storage system. Data loss in an erasure coded system depends on the <b>repair</b> <b>duration</b> and the failure probability of individual disks.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{considers}} {{joint production}} control and product quality specification {{decision making in}} a failure prone manufacturing system. This is {{with the knowledge that}} tight process specifications, while leading to a product of more reliable quality and higher market value, are at the same time associated with higher levels of non conforming parts, a higher rate of parts rejection and thus a lowering of overall plant productivity. The decision making is further complicated by the lack of reliability of the production process which imposes that an adequate, also to be designed, level of inventory of finished parts be maintained. The overall optimal decision policy is defined here as one that maximizes the long term average per unit time profit of a combined measure of quality and quantity dependent sales revenue, minus inventory and backlog costs, in the presence of random plant failures and random <b>repair</b> <b>durations.</b> Policy optimization is achieved via a simulation and experimental design based methodology for Markovian and more general cases...|$|R

40|$|Alternated renewal {{processes}} and regenerative processes {{are often used}} to model many situations in applied probability, for example in reliability and queueing theory. Here we will focus on problems arising in reliability {{although it is not}} a real restriction. Consider a repairable binary component (i. e. either being working or failed). Since failure and <b>repair</b> <b>durations</b> are assumed to be two sequences of iid random variables, the behaviour of the component is described by a regenerative processs. For some reasons, one may prefer to replace the underlying distributions by phase-type distributions, since it is leading to a Markovian model. As examples of such situations, one could refer to [1]. Despite such approximations are frequent in practical situations, no theoretical results are proved. In this talk, we aim at providing convergence results of some quantities of interest in reliability. A main application of these results could be a central limit theorem for some hitting times of a system made of iid binary components, starting from a limit theorem proved in a Markovian setting [2]. Numerical illustrations are supplied...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the probability of}} data loss, or equivalently, the reliability function for an erasure coded distributed data storage system under worst case conditions. Data loss in an erasure coded system depends on probability distributions for the disk <b>repair</b> <b>duration</b> and the disk failure duration. In previous works, the data loss probability of such systems has been studied under the assumption of exponentially distributed disk failure and disk repair durations, using well-known analytic methods from the theory of Markov processes. These methods lead to {{an estimate of the}} integral of the reliability function. Here, we address the problem of directly calculating the data loss probability for general repair and failure duration distributions. A closed limiting form is developed for the probability of data loss and it is shown that the probability of the event that a <b>repair</b> <b>duration</b> exceeds a failure duration is sufficient for characterizing the data loss probability. For the case of constant <b>repair</b> <b>duration,</b> we develop an expression for the conditional data loss probability given the number of failures experienced by a each node in a given time window. We do so by developing a geometric approach that relies on the computation of volumes of a family of polytopes that are related to the code. An exact calculation is provided and an upper bound on the data loss probability is obtained by posing the problem as a set avoidance problem. Theoretical calculations are compared to simulation results. Comment: 28 pages. 8 figures.

Classifying equipment on the basis of repair durations {{is considered one of the}} essential works to schedule maintenance activities effectively. In this study, repair data of electric cable shovels used in the Western Coal Company, Turkey, has been analyzed using correspondence analysis to classify shovels in terms of repair durations. Correspondence analysis, particularly helpful in analysing cross-tabular data in the form of numerical frequencies, has provided a graphical display that permitted more rapid interpretation and understanding of the repair data. The results indicated that there are five groups of shovels according to their <b>repair</b> <b>duration.</b> Especially, shovels numbered 2, 3, 7, 10 and 11 required a <b>repair</b> <b>duration</b> of< 1 �h and maintained relatively good service condition when compared with others.

40|$|International audienceAn {{infrastructure}} is conventionally {{represented as a}} system of systems, where individual components are heavily interdependent. In this context, {{the assessment of the}} robustness or the resilience of an infrastructure requires to quantify a set of appropriate system performance indicators. The latter are usually accessed through the prediction of the functionality level of the components, and not only their physical damage states. Therefore the present study details a procedure for the derivation of probabilistic functionality loss curves, applied to the seismic fragility assessment of roadway bridges. The proposed approach may be decomposed into the following steps:-Identification of the bridge's structural components and corresponding damage mechanisms (e. g. yielding of pier columns, deformation of bearings, deck unseating, etc.);-Association of each component damage mode with a probabilistic distribution of functionality loss and <b>repair</b> <b>duration,</b> through an expert elicitation process;-Construction of a Bayesian Network (BN) in order to update the probabilistic distributions of losses at the bridge level, which result from the combinations of damage events at the component level [1]. The resulting curves directly express the probability of reaching or exceeding some predefined functionality levels given the seismic intensity at the bridge location. The use of BNs allows for the joint probability of functionality loss and <b>repair</b> <b>duration</b> to be accessed, which constitute crucial information for the design of restoration strategies. The derived functionality curves are then applied to a simplified road network, where thousands of probabilistic earthquake scenarios are generated in order to derive the distribution of the resilience index [2], with the inter-city travel time as the main performance indicator. Finally, various assumptions about restoration resources are also tested (e. g. possibility or not to perform repair operations at the same time), in order to check their effect on the restoration strategy...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the value of}} the observed to expected fetal lung area to head circumference ratio (o/e LHR) and liver position in the prediction of neonatal morbidity in survivors with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Methods: Neonatal morbidity was recorded in 100 consecutive cases with isolated CDH diagnosed in fetal medicine units, which were expectantly managed in the prenatal period, were delivered after 30 weeks and survived until discharge from hospital. Regression analysis was used to identify the significant predictors of morbidity, including prenatal and immediate neonatal findings. Results: The o/e LHR provided significant prediction of the need for prosthetic patch <b>repair,</b> <b>duration</b> of assisted ventilation, need for supplemental oxygen at 28 days, and incidence of feeding problems. An additional independent prenatal predictor of the need for patch repair was the presence of fetal liver in the chest.

ABV treats a building as a unique collection of familiar assemblies (e. g., gypsum board partitions, suspended ceilings, etc.) that may be damaged or escape damage in an earthquake, rather than treating the building as a monolithic unit that experiences some undifferentiated damage fraction between zero and 100 % of replacement cost. Building assemblies are modelled as having probabilistic capacity to resist imposed seismic demand (measured in terms of force, acceleration, drift, etc.). Demand is estimated using familiar structural analytical techniques. Capacity is determined using laboratory test data, earthquake experience data, {{and in the case}} of suspended ceilings, reliability techniques. With ABV, building-specific structural analysis is brought to bear on the issue of seismic vulnerability. Furthermore, repair cost and <b>repair</b> <b>duration</b> are modelled using familiar cost estimation techniques and Gantt scheduling.

This study examined the relation of ventricular arrhythmia during normal daily activities to the timing of <b>repair,</b> <b>duration</b> of follow up, and postoperative haemodynamic status. Forty eight hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring was performed in 145 patients: 60 (aged 3 months to 46 years) had not yet undergone repair and 85 were followed from four to 22 (mean 14. 6) years after repair. Cardiac catheterisation was performed in 47 (55 %) one to 22 (mean 8. 9) years after repair. Twelve (20 %) of the uncorrected group had ventricular arrhythmia.

In the corrected group 44 % had ventricular arrhythmia. The incidence of arrhythmia was associated with older age at repair but not with postoperative haemodynamic status, duration of follow up, or era of surgery.

MethodsPatients with tetralogy of Fallot underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, maximal bicycle ergometry, electrocardiography, Holter monitoring, and spirometry. Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to determine independent predictors for selected clinical parameters. ResultsFifty-nine patients (mean ± SD), age at repair 0. 9 ± 0. 5 years, interval since repair 14 ± 5 years, were included. The median pulmonary regurgitant fraction was 32 % (0 %- 57 %). Compared with published data on healthy controls, Fallot patients had significantly larger right ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and smaller right ventricular and left ventricular ejection fractions. Maximum oxygen consumption was 97 % ± 17 % and maximum workload 89 % ± 13 % of predicted. Median QRS duration was 110 ms (82 – 161 ms). No important ventricular arrhythmias were found. Compared with patients without a transannular patch, patients with a patch had more pulmonary regurgitation, a larger right ventricle, worse right ventricular and left ventricular ejection fractions, but comparable exercise capacity. Multivariate regression analysis identified the following independent determinants for larger right ventricular volumes: longer interval since <b>repair,</b> longer QRS <b>duration,</b> and higher pulmonary regurgitation percentage. The following were independent determinants for smaller right ventricular ejection fraction: abnormal right ventricular outflow tract wall motion, longer interval since repair, and longer QRS duration. For smaller maximum oxygen consumption, the independent determinants were smaller right ventricular ejection fraction and longer QRS duration. ConclusionsAt mid-to-late follow-up, clinical condition in tetralogy of Fallot corrected according to contemporary surgical approaches appears well preserved. However, even these patients show right ventricular dilation and dysfunction associated with impaired functional capacity.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the context}} of {{infrastructure}} risk assessment, the application of fragility curves to elements such as bridges should mostly serve the purpose of quantifying the performance losses at the system level (e. g. disruption of traffic, additional travel times), since these losses usually outweigh the direct {{costs associated with the}} physical damage of infrastructure. To this end, a methodology is proposed for the derivation of probabilistic functionality curves for bridge systems: these curves directly provide the probability of exceedance of various loss metrics given the level of seismic intensity. The main steps of the proposed approach are the following:- Identification of the failure modes for the various components of the bridge system (e. g. piers, bearings, deck, abutments, etc.). - Derivation of specific component fragility curves for each component damage state. - Estimation of the functionality losses that are associated with each component failure mode, through an expert-based survey. - Construction of a Bayesian Network that describes the failure of the system, from the seismic intensity to the component damage states and the subsequent functionality losses. - Use of the Bayesian Network to generate the joint probability of occurrence of various levels of functionality losses given the seismic intensity. This approach is then applied to a generic multi-span simply-supported reinforced concrete bridge, for which component fragility curves are analytically derived through non-linear time-history analyses. The considered loss metrics are the <b>repair</b> <b>duration,</b> the proportion of closed lanes and the speed limit reduction, so that these parameters can be directly fed into traffic modelling tools for the computation of induced delays and the optimization of restoration strategies...|$|E

This technique is mainly used by the aircraft industry as it offers high reliability, short repair times and reduced cost in compare to other methods, such as the riveted joints. CPR consists of adhesively bonding thin composite patches over cracked or corroded areas with heat supply. As the polymer- matrix composite patch is heated, it cures and toughens. Proper curing insures structural reliability of the <b>repair.</b> Short <b>duration</b> curing cycles are of great importance for the aircraft availability. With the use of Genetic Algorithms we design minimum time curing cycles. The optimization is subjected to {{a great number of}} constraints. The constraints taken into consideration are: 1) Maximum allowed temperature in order to avoid residual stresses, 2) Maximum heating rate of the heat supply device, 3) Minimum temperature in order to initiate the cure reaction, 4) Maximum cooling-off rate once the heating has stopped, 5) Sufficient degree of cure {{at the end of the}} process. Our design vector contains the duration of all cure cycle stages and the characteristic thermal profile. The number of cure cycle stages is predefined. For the analysis, we consider linear interpolation for the temperature between nodal values supplied by the optimization procedure. The degree of cure is estimated with the use of the Kamal cure rate model for thermosetting polymers. For the numerical time integration of the cure equation a Runge-Kutta scheme is employed...|$|R
40|$|Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is a {{constriction}} of {{the proximal}} descending thoracic aorta {{and is one}} of the most common congenital cardiovascular defects. Treatments for CoA improve life expectancy, but morbidity persists, particularly due to the development of chronic hypertension (HTN). Identifying the mechanisms of morbidity is difficult in humans due to confounding variables such as age at <b>repair,</b> follow-up <b>duration,</b> coarctation severity and concurrent anomalies. We previously developed an experimental model that replicates aortic pathology in humans with CoA without these confounding variables, and mimics correction at various times using dissolvable suture. Here we present the most comprehensive description of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to date from the pathology of CoA, which were obtained using this model. Aortic samples (n= 4 /group) from the ascending aorta that experiences elevated blood pressure (BP) from induction of CoA, and restoration of normal BP after its correction, were analyzed by gene expression microarray, and enriched genes were converted to human orthologues. 51 DEGs with > 6 fold-change (FC) were used to determine enriched Gene Ontology terms, altered pathways, and association with National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headers (MeSH) IDs for HTN, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CoA. The results generated 18 pathways, 4 of which (cell cycle, immune system, hemostasis and metabolism) were shared with MeSH ID's for HTN and CVD, and individual genes were associated with the CoA MeSH ID. A thorough literature search further uncovered association with contractile, cytoskeletal and regulatory proteins related to excitation-contraction coupling and metabolism that may explain the structural and functional changes observed in our experimental model, and ultimately help to unravel the mechanisms responsible for persistent morbidity after treatment for CoA...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} which factors affect {{the recovery of}} visual function in macula off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). Methods: In a prospective study of forty-five patients with a primary macula-off RRD of 24 hours to 6 weeks duration, {{the height of the}} macular detachment was determined by ultrasonography. At 12 months postoperatively, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), contrast acuity, and color confusion indexes (CCI) were obtained. Results: Macular detachment was present for 2 – 32 (median 7) days before <b>repair.</b> A shorter <b>duration</b> of macular detachment was correlated with a better CCI sature ́ (p = 0. 0026) and lower LogMAR BCVA (better Snellen visual acuity) (p = 0. 012). Also, a smaller height of macular detachment was correlated with a lower LogMAR BCVA (p = 0. 0034). A younger age and lower pre-operative LogMAR BCVA at presentation were both correlated with better postoperative contrast acuity in the total group (age: p = 1. 761024 and pre-operative LogMAR BCVA: p = 0. 0034). Conclusion: Functional recovery after macula-off RRD is affected by the duration and the height of the macular detachment...|$|R
