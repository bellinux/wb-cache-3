40|$|A {{method for}} the {{determination}} of 2 -mercaptobenzimidazole (MB) in mixtures by derivative spectrophotometry has been developed. MB is used as antioxidant {{in the manufacture of}} industrial <b>rubber.</b> <b>Derivative</b> spectrophotometry has been applied for the elimination of the mutual interferences of the other polymer additives in the MB estimation. Thus, the procedure works whitout any separation step of MB from the other polymer additives. The second derivative spectrum of MB was measured at 304 nm while the third derivative was measured at 308 nm. At these wavelengths, the spectra of the other additives cross the zero line or are insignificant. Beer's law has been valid in the concentration range 0. 25 - 10 µg MB/mL (by applying the second derivative) and 0. 5 - 10 µg MB/mL (by applying the third derivative) ...|$|E
50|$|Founded in Milan in 1872 by Giovanni Battista Pirelli, {{the company}} {{initially}} specialised in <b>rubber</b> and <b>derivative</b> processes and also made scuba diving rebreathers. Thereafter, Pirelli's activities were primarily {{focused on the}} production of tyres and cables (for energy and telecommunications). In 2005, Pirelli sold its cable division to Goldman Sachs, which changed the new group's name to Prysmian.|$|R

50|$|Specific {{measures}} for {{materials and articles}} such as ceramics, regenerated cellulose, plastics, gaskets and active and intelligent materials, and substances such as vinyl chloride, N-nitrosamines and N-nitrostable substances in <b>rubber,</b> and epoxy <b>derivatives,</b> exist.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the most important}} causes of contact allergic reactions on the eyes and eyelids. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study provides an analysis of patch-test results obtained in a population of 1554 patients suffering from conjunctivitis and/or dermatitis on the eyelids, {{out of a total}} population of 9035 patients investigated for contact allergy between January 1990 and October 2003. If indicated, also prick testing with a latex extract was performed. RESULTS: 864 (56 %) of the patients with eye- and/or eyelid-involvement presented with a positive reaction to {{at least one of the}} contact allergens tested. The main sensitisation sources were topical pharmaceutical products (antibiotics, corticosteroids), cosmetics (fragrance components, preservatives, emulsifiers, hair-care and nail products), metals (nickel), <b>rubber</b> <b>derivatives,</b> resins (e. g. epoxy resin), and plants. Also latex-allergy (immediate-type sensitivity presenting as a contact-urticaria syndrome) was a frequent finding in such patients. CONCLUSION: Contact allergy is a common cause of eyelid dermatitis in particular and the allergens may reach the skin in many different ways. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|The largest {{application}} of aniline {{is for the}} preparation of methylene dianiline and related compounds by condensation with formaldehyde (as discussed above). The diamines are condensed with phosgene to give methylene diphenyl diisocyanate, a precursor to urethane polymers.Other uses include rubber processing chemicals (9%), herbicides (2%), and dyes and pigments (2%).

40|$|Deposits from {{different}} sections of a newsprint paper mill, using 100 % recovered paper, were analyzed following an analytical procedure based on scaning electron microscopy-electron dispersive X-ray and consecutive solvent extraction steps with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) {{analyses of the}} different fractions. Polyvinyl acetate, polyacrylates, styrene butadiene <b>rubber,</b> and <b>derivatives</b> of fatty acids/resin acids are the main stickies-related components identified in the deposits. The removal efficiency of these contaminants along the deinking line was studied by determining {{the composition of the}} dichloromethane extractives in the pulp by FTIR analyses. Although the total stickies content is reduced considerably during the process, some compounds, which are found in the deposits, are not removed selectively in the process, indicating their recalcitrant nature. FTIR analyses of unusable materials coming with the raw material (mainly board and mixed office waste) have demonstrated that these materials are one of the main sources of these types of recalcitrant stickies...|$|R
40|$|L'accroissement des contraintes subies par les matériaux utilisés dans les {{techniques}} pétrolières et parapétrolières et liées aux températures et pressions élevées ainsi qu'aux agressions chimiques, fait que l'on exige de ces matériaux qu'ils soient de plus en plus performants. Ceci implique, pour les concepteurs et utilisateurs de matériel comportant des élastomères en contact avec les hydrocarbures, une connaissance actualisée des produits existants, lesquels sont en constante évolution. On commence donc par décrire les principales familles d'élastomères résistant en milieu pétrolier actuellement disponibles sur le marché. Puis, après avoir évoqué les problèmes que rencontrent les industries pétrolière et automobile dans l'utilisation des élastomères et présenté sommairement les résultats de travaux réalisés à l'Institut Français du Pétrole (IFP), on définira quelques axes de recherches dont la finalité est de participer à l'amélioration des techniques pétrolières dans le sens d'une meilleure fiabilité et d'une réduction des coûts. The {{materials used}} in the oil and automotive industries are being subjected to higher and higher mechanical, thermal and chemical stresses, so these materials, and especially elastomers, {{have to be more}} and more resistant. For designers and users of equipment containing elastomers in contact with hydrocarbons, this requires an updated understanding of existing products. The aim of this article is thus to describe, first of all, the leading families of resistant elastomers now available for use in a petroleum environment, with particular emphasis on chlorinated, fluorinated, acrylic and nitrile <b>rubbers</b> and their <b>derivatives,</b> which have evolved greatly in recent years with the appearance of new varieties and new types of elastomers, such as Atlas, Vamac, Eypel, etc. For each family of elastomer, the structure is described along with the vulcanization method, its properties and its uses. Then the problems with which elastomers are confronted in the petroleum industry are described. They are mainly linked to the high pressures and temperatures encoutered in boreholes and to chemical attacks due to acid gases, corrosion inhibitors and completion and treatment fluids. Elastomers must also be resistant to blistering, extrusion and abrasion. The proper choice of a material can lead to a reduction in operating costs and to increased safety. Concerted action among elastomer producers and users seems indispensable. Problems in the automotive industry are linked to the increase in thermal stresses due to the raising of the temperature underneath the hood, to the use of new fuels, unleaded gasoline oxygenated fuel, and to the evolution of lubricant additives. This is leading to the progressive forsaking of nitrile rubber and polychloroprene to the benefit of higher-performance but more expensive elastomers such as fluorinated rubbers or hydrogenated nitrile rubbers. Fluorosilicones and acrylics are also being called upon for development in the automotive industry. Then several research findings made at Institut Français du Pétrole (IFP) are described, concerning the comparative analysis of the behavior of nitrile, hydrogenated nitrile and fluorinated rubbers in complex petroleum environments, together with a few examples of applications in the field of pumps, composite-material tubes with an elastomeric liner and gaskets. To conclude some suggestions are made on possibilities of improving elastomers for petroleum applications, based on {{a better understanding of the}} phenomenon of blistering, an improvement of vulcanization systems and the optimizing of some elastomers such as HNBR. Progress is also possible in the behavior of elastomers with regard to lubricants and fuels and in the predicting of the lifetime of seals used in boreholes...|$|R
