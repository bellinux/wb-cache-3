The reset is normally done either by a physical button or in a menu of the on-board computer. iTPMS are, compared to dTPMS, more sensitive to the influences of different tires and external influences like road surfaces and driving speed or style. The <b>reset</b> <b>procedure,</b> followed by an automatic learning phase of typically 20 to 60 minutes of driving under which the iTPMS learns and stores the reference parameters before it becomes fully active, cancels out many, but not all of these.

Choosing one schedule disabled the alternate schedule and stimuli until {{the requirements of}} the chosen schedule were satisfied, at which point both schedules were again made available. Fixed-interval duration remained constant within individual sessions but varied across conditions. Under reset conditions, completing the fixed-interval schedule not only produced food but also reset the progressive interval to its minimum. Blocks of sessions under the <b>reset</b> <b>procedure</b> were interspersed with sessions under a no-reset procedure, in which the progressive schedule value increased independent of fixed-interval choices. Median points of switching from the progressive to the fixed schedule varied systematically with fixed-interval value, and were consistently lower during reset than during no-reset conditions. Under the latter, each subject's choices of the progressive-interval schedule persisted beyond the point at which its requirements equaled those of the fixed-interval schedule at all but the highest fixed-interval value. Under the <b>reset</b> <b>procedure,</b> switching occurred at or prior to that equality point.

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{method of}} qubit measurements in circuit QED is employing the dispersive regime of qubit-cavity coupling, {{which results in}} an approximated scheme of quantum nondemolition (QND) readout. However, this scheme breaks down owing to the Purcell effect {{in the case of}} strong coupling and/or strong measurement drive. To remove the drawbacks of the dispersive readout, a recent proposal by virtue of longitudinal coupling suggests a new scheme to realize fast, high-fidelity and ideal QND readout of qubit state.

The longitudinal coupling provides as well a convenient method of cavity reset.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this note is to report the {{feasibility}} and clinical validation of an in-house developed MOSFET dosimetry system and describe an integrated non-destructive <b>reset</b> <b>procedure.</b> Off-the-shelf MOSFETs are connected to a common PC using an 18 bit/analogue-input and 16 bit/output data acquisition card. A reading algorithm was developed defining the zero-temperature-coefficient point (ZTC) to determine the threshold voltage. A wireless interface was established for ease of use. The <b>reset</b> <b>procedure</b> consists of an internal circuit generating a local heating induced by an electrical current. Sensitivity has been investigated {{as a function of}} bias voltage (0 - 9 V) to the gate. Dosimetric properties have been evaluated for 6 MV and 15 MV clinical photon beams and in vivo benchmarking was performed against thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLD) for conventional treatments (two groups of ten patients for each energy) and total body irradiation (TBI). MOSFETS were pre-irradiated with 20 Gy. Sensitivity of 0. 08 mV cGy(- 1) can be obtained for 200 cGy irradiations at 5 V bias voltage. Ten consecutive measurements at 200 cGy yield a SD of 2. 08 cGy (1. 05 %). Increasing the dose in steps from 5 cGy to 1000 cGy yields a 1. 00 Pearson correlation coefficient and agreement within 2. 0 %. Dose rate dependence (160 - 800 cGy min(- 1)) was within 2. 5 %, temperature dependence within 2. 0 % (25 - 37 degrees C). A strong angular dependence has been observed for gantry incidences exceeding +/- 30 degrees C. Dose response is stable up to 50 Gy (saturation occurs at approximately 90 Gy), which is used as threshold dose before resetting the MOSFET. An average measured-over-calculated dose ratio within 1. 05 (SD: 0. 04) has been obtained in vivo. TBI midplane-dose assessed by entrance and exit dose measurements agreed within 1. 9 % with ionization chamber in phantom, and within 1. 0 % with TLD in vivo. An in-house developed resettable MOSFET-based dosimetry system is proposed. The system has been validated and is currently used for in vivo entrance dose measurement in clinical routine for simple (open field) treatment configurations. status: publishe...|$|E

Finally, the preparation and properties of Sr 2 (Ta 1 -xNbx) 2 O 7 solid-solutions are investigated as a function of composition in the last section. 5. 1 LITERATURE REVIEW As discussed in Chapter 1, the ferroelectric random access memory (FRAM) devices are divided into two categories, based on the readout technique: destructive readout (DRO) and non-destructive read-out (NDRO). In the DRO FRAM device, reading operation is carried out destructively i. e. reversing the original polarization state, and reading the switching current. Therefore, reset procedures are required to restore the switched polarization state to the original position. On the other hand, the NDRO FRAM devices read the stored data by sensing the modulation of the surface conductivity of the silicon rather than switching the polarization state. This reading method provides a privilege of non-destructive readout and eliminates the <b>reset</b> <b>procedure.</b> The NDR...|$|E

In previous work on this subject, the authors have identified a radial basis function neural network one-step-ahead predictive model, which provides very good prediction accuracy and is currently in use at the Portuguese power-grid company. As the model is a static mapping employing external dynamics and the electricity consumption time-series trend and dynamics are varying with time, further work was carried out in order to test model resetting techniques as a means to update the model over time.

In addition, the switching mechanism is proved to be the redox reaction through a specific constant switching energy. The dynamic switching mechanisms during <b>reset</b> <b>procedure</b> in RRAM were also clarified by a sequential experimental design. According to the electrical measurement and analysis in ultra-cryogenic measurement systems, we verify that the ultra-fast switching speed of RRAM is attributed to several atomic reaction procedures in virtue of the atomic-level quantized phenomena in ultra-cryogenic temperature situation. Based on the investigation of resistance switching physical mechanism in RRAM devices, we designed a high performance multi-functional RRAM device by modifying the resistance switching layers, new device structures, and novel process technology. The reproducible bipolar resistance switching characteristics with acceptable reliability have been successfully achieved by doping few mole fraction of metal into the SiO 2 film using the cosputtering technique at room temperature. With its strong intrinsic current self-limiting ability, CRS implementation capability, and whole sweeping cycle multi-bit property, the double-ended GO-doped silicon oxide-based structure is a promising technique to the future mass production of RRAM. Furthermore, the operation current of metal-doped silicon oxide RRAM device can be reduced by SCCO 2 fluid treatment. Based on the analysis of resistive switching physical mechanism, the water molecules can be brought into the film to passivate the dangling bonds in the resistive switching layer due to hydration-dehydration reactions. In the future, we hope to spend more efforts to build up a universal model on resistive switching behaviors of oxide-based RRAM so as to boost the mass production of RRAM and also facilitate the fabrication of three-dimensional stacking structure storage circuits.|$|E

In this paper we study a particle system for the viscous Burgers equations using a Monte–Carlo version of the above; we consider N copies of the above stochastic flow, each driven by independent Wiener processes, and replace the expected value with 1 N times the sum over these copies.

Serum ascorbate levels were monitored over an eight week period and the animals were inspected for signs of scurvy. The delayed type hypersensitivity reaction to mycobacterial antigens, a T lymphocyte-dependent function, was recorded as the diameter of the induration formed at the injection site. The total number of leukocytes per cu mm of blood was counted and the relative percentage of T cells was determined by the lymphocyte-erythrocyte <b>resetting</b> <b>procedure.</b> Guinea pig serum IgG levels were measured by radial immunodiffusion as antibody production is aided by a subset of T cells.
