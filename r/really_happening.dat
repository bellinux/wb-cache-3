5|$|Don't Look Now {{is renowned}} for its {{innovative}} editing style and its use of recurring motifs and themes and for a controversial sex scene that was explicit for its time. The film often employs flashbacks and flashforwards {{in keeping with the}} depiction of precognition, but some scenes are intercut or merged to alter the viewer's perception of what is <b>really</b> <b>happening.</b> It adopts an impressionist approach to its imagery, often presaging events with familiar objects, patterns and colours using associative editing techniques.|$|E

Some MPs suggested that the live telecast should not be scrapped to let the people know what was <b>really</b> <b>happening</b> in the Dewan Rakyat and judge the MPs in conducting the people's voice in the parliament. The live telecast of the proceedings is to be continued {{to show that there}} is transparency and to let the people know how the MPs are behaving and debating.|$|E

A writer of The Times of India found a break-up theme in the song, further saying that [...] "In 'Girl', the relational mishaps play out as three-way girl talk, with two girlfriends trying to help their sister see the truth of a bad connection". It opens with Beyoncé singing the lines [...] "Take a minute girl, come sit down/ And tell us what's been happening/ In your face I can see the pain/ Don't try and convince us you're happy." ...|$|E

It is described by Rolling Stone as an [...] "ambivalent aggro-folk track". McIlrath said of the song, [...] "I {{wanted to take the}} perspective [...] of 'What is the war going to be looked back on as?'" [...] In another interview McIlrath stated, [...] "It was a way to document what's going on, like other artists documented for their generation and for generations to come." [...] He went on to say, [...] "There are not many songs...talking about what's going on during eight years of occupation in Iraq. That, combined with meeting active soldiers and retired soldiers at our shows and hearing those stories {{about what is going on}} on the ground amid all the bullshit, showed me the differences from what is <b>really</b> <b>happening</b> to what is happening in the news media.

People were {{shooting}} speed. I mean, it was real Night of the Living Dead. So I bought a truck and headed out west.

2500|$|Otherwise unexplained blackouts {{underwater}} {{have been}} associated with the practice of hyperventilation. Survivors of shallow water blackouts often report using hyperventilation as a technique to increase the time they can spend underwater. Hyperventilation, or over-breathing, involves breathing faster and/or deeper than the body naturally demands and is often used by divers in the mistaken belief that this will increase oxygen saturation. Although this appears true intuitively, under normal circumstances the breathing rate dictated by the body alone already leads to 98–99% oxygen saturation of the arterial blood and the effect of over-breathing on the oxygen intake is minor. What is <b>really</b> <b>happening</b> differs from divers' understanding; these divers are extending their dive by postponing the body's natural breathing mechanism, not by increasing oxygen load. [...] The mechanism is as follows: ...|$|E

In the same way I have seen a man from the south of Scotland settle down to read the Dumfries Chronicle with a deep sigh of satisfaction: and a man from Burlington, Vermont, pick up the Burlington Eagle and study the foreign news in it as the only way of getting at what was <b>really</b> <b>happening</b> in France and Germany.|$|E
60|$|No {{doubt it}} is {{producing}} enormous quantities of cerebration, {{but is it}} anything more than chaotic and futile cerebration? We are told {{all sorts of things}} in answer to that, things without a scrap of evidence or probability to support them. It is, we are assured, turning people to religion, making them moral and thoughtful. It is also, we are assured with equal confidence, turning them to despair and moral disaster. It will be followed by (1) a period of moral renascence, and (2) a debauch. It is going to make the workers (1) more and (2) less obedient and industrious. It is (1) inuring men to war and (2) filling them with a passionate resolve never to suffer war again. And so on. I propose now to ask what is <b>really</b> <b>happening</b> in this matter? How is human opinion changing? I have opinions of my own and they are bound to colour my discussion. The reader must allow for that, and as far as possible I will remind him where necessary to make his allowance.|$|E

It must give a man a terrible sense of responsibility, make him feel that he simply must be noble, even if he naturally wasn't. Yes! it must be a wonderful profession, and only fit for the highest!

60|$|To {{be up to}} date is {{a paltry}} {{ambition}} except in an almanac, and Shaw has sometimes talked this almanac philosophy. Nevertheless {{there is a real}} sense in which the phrase may be wisely used, and that is in cases where some stereotyped version of what is happening hides what is <b>really</b> <b>happening</b> from our eyes. Thus, for instance, newspapers are never up to date. The men who write leading articles are always behind the times, because they are in a hurry. They are forced to fall back on their old-fashioned view of things; they have no time to fashion a new one. Everything that is done in a hurry is certain to be antiquated; that is why modern industrial civilisation bears so curious a resemblance to barbarism. Thus when newspapers say that the Times is a solemn old Tory paper, they are out of date; their talk is behind the talk in Fleet Street. Thus when newspapers say that Christian dogmas are crumbling, they are out of date; their talk is behind the talk in public-houses. Now in this sense Shaw has kept in a really stirring sense up to date. He has introduced into the theatre the things that no one else had introduced into a theatre--the things in the street outside. The theatre is a sort of thing which proudly sends a hansom-cab across the stage as Realism, while everybody outside is whistling for motor-cabs.|$|E
