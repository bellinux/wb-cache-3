2500|$|Confusion {{over the}} {{original}} date {{arose in the}} mid-1990s and continues to arouse controversy, with the club accepting the earlier date and then reverting to the original during the late 21st century. Former club statistician Paul Plowman researched {{the early history of}} the club during the period 1990–95 and discovered newspaper reports of a game in 1879 between Swindon Association Football Club and Rovers F.C.. [...] The report and team photos show William Pitt playing for the team. Reverend Pitt, who was 23 at the time, was the curate of Christchurch, Swindon's central church. He was appointed Rector of Liddington church in 1881 and severed his ties to the club. Plowman was given the role of Swindon Town <b>Retail</b> <b>Manager</b> in 1995 and the kit for the 1995–96 season [...] carried an [...] "Est. 1879" [...] tag, since removed.

2500|$|Incumbent Bob Parker {{announced}} 14 {{months prior}} to the election that he would seek a third term as mayor. There was much speculation for many months over who would challenge Parker. Dalziel's name was persistently mentioned, but she denied any interest, declaring instead that the job that she really wanted is Gerry Brownlee's as Earthquake Recovery Minister, rather than Bob Parker's. Three first term councillors were also rumoured, with Tim Carter seen as the most likely to come forward. In April 2013, Christchurch's main newspaper, The Press, announced that Dalziel would stand, having asked Student Volunteer Army organiser Sam Johnson to be her running mate. This caused surprise since Dalziel and Johnson are from opposite ends of the political spectrum, but he declined the invitation anyway. It was not until mid June that Dalziel confirmed her candidacy. At the same time, serious problems developed at Christchurch City Council (CCC) over building consent issues, which led to Parker withdrawing his candidacy and council's chief executive, Tony Marryatt, losing his job. In early August, central city <b>retail</b> <b>manager</b> Paul Lonsdale announced his candidacy and was immediately credited by The Press as the most viable alternative to Dalziel, but senior journalist Lois Cairns predicted the following day that Lonsdale [...] "will come in a distant second". Dalziel, the former Labour Party MP for Christchurch East and up to the election the representative of the Christchurch East electorate, had been in Parliament since [...] and was considered the top favourite. Of the remaining ten candidates, The Press labelled them a mixture of eccentrics, tryers and also-rans.|$|E
2500|$|Coronation Street and its {{characters}} often {{rely heavily}} on archetypes, with the characterisation {{of some of its}} current and recent cast based loosely on past characters. Phyllis Pearce (Jill Summers), Blanche Hunt (Maggie Jones) and Sylvia Goodwin (Stephanie Cole) embodied the role of the acid-tongued busybody originally held by Ena, Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor) has grown snobbish, like Annie, and a number of the programme's female characters, such as Carla Connor (Alison King), mirror the vulnerability of Elsie and Bet. Other recurring archetypes include the war veteran such as Albert Tatlock (Jack Howarth), Percy Sugden (Bill Waddington) and Gary Windass (Mikey North), the bumbling <b>retail</b> <b>manager</b> like Leonard Swindley (Arthur Lowe), Reg Holdsworth (Ken Morley), Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden), quick-tempered, tough tradesmen like Len Fairclough (Peter Adamson), Jim McDonald (Charles Lawson), Tommy Harris (Thomas Craig) and Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies), and the perennial losers such as Stan and Hilda, Jack and Vera, Les Battersby (Bruce Jones), Beth Tinker (Lisa George) and Kirk Sutherland (Andrew Whyment). Villains like Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), Alan Bradley (Mark Eden), Jenny Bradley (Sally Ann Matthews), Rob Donovan (Marc Baylis), Frank Foster (Andrew Lancel), Tony Gordon (Gray O'Brien), Caz Hammond (Rhea Bailey), Richard Hillman (Brian Capron), Greg Kelly (Stephen Billington), Will Chatterton (Leon Ockenden), Nathan Curtis (Christopher Harper), Callum Logan (Sean Ward), Karl Munro (John Michie), Pat Phelan (Connor McIntyre), David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd), Maya Sharma (Sasha Behar), Kirsty Soames (Natalie Gumede) and John Stape (Graeme Hawley) are also common character types. The show's former archivist and scriptwriter Daran Little disagreed with the characterisation of the show as a collection of stereotypes. [...] "Rather, remember that Elsie, Ena and others. were the first of their kind ever seen on British television. If later characters are stereotypes, it's because they are from the same original mould. It is the hundreds of programmes that have followed which have copied Coronation Street." ...|$|E

Many <b>retail</b> <b>managers</b> are receptive to changes in global markets, technology, and customer demands. The purpose of this qualitative single case study was to explore the strategies that some <b>retail</b> <b>managers</b> used to motivate their sales associates to maintain a competitive advantage in the retail industry. Maintaining a competitive advantage increases profitability and customer satisfaction. Sustainable Supply Chain Management was the primary conceptual framework for this study. The purposive sample consisted of 4 <b>retail</b> <b>managers</b> from a mid-sized retail distribution organization in southeastern Georgia. Face-to-face interviews were recorded, transcribed, verified, and analyzed. Analysis in this qualitative single case study was based on the sustainable supply chain management framework. Four emergent themes were identified relating to essential strategies, ethical factors, risk factors, and the value of sustainable strategy toward stakeholders, suppliers, and customers. Implications for positive social change include retail managers’ improved ability to motivate their sales associates to maintain a competitive advantage, which will allow organizations to sustain their progress in the community and thereby contribute to the success and wellbeing of employees, families, communities, and the economy.

40|$|Research {{suggests}} that 70 % of North American employees are disengaged in the workplace. Some small <b>retail</b> <b>managers</b> lack strategies for engaging employees. Using the employee engagement framework, {{the purpose of}} this descriptive case study was to explore successful strategies that small <b>retail</b> <b>managers</b> use to engage employees. The target population was small retail leaders, purposefully selected because of their success with engaging employees at an Orlando, Florida, company. Data collection was through face-to-face interviews with 5 leaders; and a review of archived organizational documents, including company memorandums, central email software, and online customer reviews through social media websites such as Google, Yelp, and Facebook posts. Data were analyzed using inductive coding of phrases and words from participant interviews, whereas secondary data were collected from participant memorandums, the company website, central email software, and online social media posts supporting the theme interpretation through methodological triangulation. The findings on these Orlando leaders revealed that supportive leaders improved employee engagement, direct communication improved employee engagement, and training improved employee performance.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} is to explore some issues {{regarding}} the career development {{of men and women}} <b>retail</b> <b>managers</b> and provide an overview of the main issues these present for retailers in the future. Methodology/approach: The research utilised combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods. Data were collected via a questionnaire survey with 286 male and female UK <b>retail</b> <b>managers.</b> Findings: Managers generally reported satisfaction with their current jobs and were highly ambitious to develop their careers. Factors managers particularly associated with facilitating their careers to date were attributed to own efforts and attitudes towards their work. Problems in their careers to date were associated with factors outside of their own control. The findings demonstrated that the culture of retailing is still perceived to be dominated by male norms and values and this has implications for the way in which men and women managers experience their jobs and career opportunities. Practical implications: Managerial recommendations include the provision of meaningful mentoring relationships, the creation of developmental opportunities not bounded by a linear structure and re-examination of organisational cultural attitudes and practices. The importance of reconsideration of working arrangements and the 1 provision of flexible working arrangements {{at all levels of the}} management hierarchy is emphasised. Originality/value: The paper contributes to current understanding of the career issues experienced by UK <b>retail</b> <b>managers</b> in the 21 st Century...|$|R

40|$|Despite using {{computerized}} merchandise {{control systems}} in retail, {{the rate of}} stockouts has remained stagnant. The inability to satisfy customer needs has caused a loss of 4 % in potential revenue and resulted in dissatisfied customers. The purpose of this qualitative multiple case {{study was to explore}} cost-effective inventory control strategies used by discount <b>retail</b> <b>managers.</b> The conceptual framework that grounded the study was chaos theory, which helped identify why some business leaders rely on forecasting techniques or other cost-effective strategies as an attempt to prevent stockouts. The target population was comprised of discount <b>retail</b> <b>managers</b> located throughout northeast Jacksonville, Florida. Purposeful sampling led to selecting 6 <b>retail</b> <b>managers</b> who successfully demonstrated cost-effective inventory control strategies for mitigating stockouts. Data were collected through face-to-face semistructured interviews, company websites, and company documents. Analysis included using nodes to identify similar words and axial-coding to categorize the nodes into themes. Transcript evaluation, member checking, and methodological triangulation strengthened the credibility of the findings. Five themes emerged: (a) internal stockout reduction strategies, (b) external stockout reduction strategies, (c) replenishment system strategies, (d) inventory optimization strategies, and (e) best practices for inventory control. This study may contribute to positive social change by improving inventory management, which may reduce demand fluctuations in the supply chain and reduce logistics costs in the transportation of freight thereby leading to improved customer satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|Examines {{the sources}} of stress {{associated}} with male and female <b>retail</b> <b>managers,</b> a sector recognised as being stressful and where {{women are more likely}} than in other occupational sectors to be managers. Self-completed questionnaires were distributed to males and females at various levels of retail management. The findings confirmed the two research hypotheses: male and female managers reported similar job pressures, in particular from “work overload”, “time pressures and deadlines”, “staff shortages and turnover rates” and “long working hours”. Moreover, female <b>retail</b> <b>managers</b> were more likely than their male counterparts to suffer from additional pressures caused by sex discrimination and prejudice. The outcome of these stressors can contribute to organisational deficiency, ultimately damaging the reputation of the company. Retail companies that successfully tackle the issue of work-related stress will be better equipped to cope with the price of change within the retail environment...|$|R
