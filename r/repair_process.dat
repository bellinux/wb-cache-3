5|$|Bonhoeffer et al. {{suggested}} that template switching by the reverse transcriptase {{acts as a}} <b>repair</b> <b>process</b> to deal with breaks in the ssRNA genome. In addition, Hu and Temin {{suggested that}} recombination is an adaptation for repair of damage in the RNA genomes. Strand switching (copy-choice recombination) by reverse transcriptase could generate an undamaged copy of genomic DNA from two damaged ssRNA genome copies. This view of the adaptive benefit of recombination in HIV could explain why each HIV particle contains two complete genomes, rather than one. Furthermore, the view that recombination is a <b>repair</b> <b>process</b> implies that the benefit of repair can occur at each replication cycle, and that this benefit can be realized {{whether or not the}} two genomes differ genetically. On the view that that recombination in HIV is a <b>repair</b> <b>process,</b> the generation of recombinational variation would be a consequence, but not the cause of, the evolution of template switching.|$|E
5|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{requires the}} presence of an identical or nearly identical sequence {{to be used as a}} template for repair of the break. The enzymatic machinery responsible for this <b>repair</b> <b>process</b> is nearly identical to the machinery responsible for chromosomal crossover during meiosis. This pathway allows a damaged chromosome to be repaired using a sister chromatid (available in G2 after DNA replication) or a homologous chromosome as a template. DSBs caused by the replication machinery attempting to synthesize across a single-strand break or unrepaired lesion cause collapse of the replication fork and are typically repaired by recombination.|$|E
5|$|Scharnhorst and Gneisenau {{had reached}} a point north-west of Lofoten, Norway, by 12:00 on 9 April. The two ships then turned west for 24hours while {{temporary}} repairs were effected. After a day of steaming west, the ships turned south and rendezvoused with Admiral Hipper on 12 April. An RAF patrol aircraft spotted the three ships that day, which prompted an air attack. The German warships were protected by poor visibility, however, and the three ships safely reached port later that day. Scharnhorst returned to Germany, and was repaired at the Deutsche Werke in Kiel. During the <b>repair</b> <b>process,</b> the aircraft catapult that had been installed on the rear gun turret was removed.|$|E

5|$|The ship then loaded {{refugees}} and left Swinemünde; she successfully navigated the minefields {{on the way}} to Kiel, arriving on 18 March. Her stern turret had its guns replaced at the Deutsche Werke shipyard by early April. During the <b>repair</b> <b>process,</b> most of the ship's crew went ashore. On the night of 9 April 1945, a general RAF bombing raid by over 300 aircraft struck the harbor in Kiel. Admiral Scheer was hit by bombs and capsized. She was partially broken up for scrap {{after the end of the}} war, though part of the hull was left in place and buried with rubble from the attack in the construction of a new quay. The number of casualties from her loss is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Following Rösselsprung, the Germans moved Tirpitz to Bogenfjord near Narvik. By this time, {{the ship}} needed a major overhaul. Hitler had {{forbidden}} {{the ship to}} make the dangerous return to Germany, and so the overhaul was conducted in Trondheim. On 23 October, the ship left Bogenfjord and returned to Fættenfjord outside Trondheim. The defences of the anchorage were further strengthened; additional anti-aircraft guns were installed, and double anti-torpedo nets were erected around the vessel. The repairs were conducted in limited phases, such that Tirpitz would remain partially operational {{for the majority of}} the overhaul. A caisson was built around the stern to allow the replacement of the ship's rudders. During the <b>repair</b> <b>process,</b> the British attempted to attack the battleship with two Chariot human torpedoes, but before they could be launched, rough seas caused the human torpedoes to break away from the fishing vessel which was towing them. By 28 December, the overhaul had been completed, and Tirpitz began sea trials. She conducted gunnery trials on 4 January 1943 in Trondheim Fjord. On 21 February, Topp was promoted to Rear Admiral and was replaced by Captain Hans Meyer; five days later the battleship Scharnhorst was ordered to reinforce the fleet in Norway. Vice Admiral Oskar Kummetz was given command of the warships stationed in Norway.|$|E
5|$|In May 1898, Diederichs sent Kaiser to Nagasaki for {{periodic}} maintenance. The Spanish–American War, {{which saw}} {{action in the}} Philippines at the Battle of Manila Bay, necessitated a German naval presence {{in the area to}} protect German nationals. Kaiser was still in Nagasaki undergoing repairs, so Diederichs ordered her and Prinzess Wilhelm, also in dock for maintenance, to meet him in Manila as soon as was possible. Crew transfers during the <b>repair</b> <b>process</b> necessitated Irene and Cormoran to meet in Manila as well; this concentration of five warships in the Philippines caused a serious crisis with the American Navy. Rear Admiral George Dewey objected {{to the size of the}} German force and to a meeting between Diederichs and Governor General Augustin, the Spanish governor of the Philippines. The German naval forces left the Philippines after the fall of Manila in August, though tensions with the United States continued for some time after.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For {{effective}} application of protons and ions in tumour radiotherapy is necessary {{understanding of the}} basic characteristics of radiobiological mechanism in individual cell. To study the cell inactivation mechanisms of various ions at different energies, damage induction and <b>repair</b> <b>processes</b> in hamster and human cell lines have been analyzed. Published survival data for Chinese hamster CHO-K 1 cells and their radiosensitive mutants xrs 5 irradiated by carbon ions and for normal human fibroblasts irradiated by various ions have been analyzed using the probabilistic twostage model [Kundrat et al, 2005]. This model enables to reflect different types of lesions caused by ionizing particles and also the consequent <b>repair</b> <b>processes</b> in cells. The characteristics of damage induction and <b>repair</b> <b>processes</b> in cells in dependence on ion kinds and their LET will be presented. In the case of Chinese hamster cells, the comparison of a normal cell line and its radiosensitive mutant emphasizes the necessity to explicitly represent the cell <b>repair</b> <b>processes</b> in radiobiological models...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{epithelium}} of {{the airway}} has considerable capacity to undergo <b>repair.</b> These <b>repair</b> <b>processes</b> {{are responsible for}} maintaining and restoring function after injury of the airways, which likely occurs often {{as a result of}} infectious, toxic or other exposures. However, <b>repair</b> <b>processes</b> need not be fully effective. Inadequate repair can take a number of forms and may result in metaplasia, hyperplasia or fibrotic scarring. It is likely that <b>repair</b> <b>processes</b> that lead to tissue disruption {{play an important role in}} the chronic airways diseases, such as asthma and bronchitis. Through delineation of these processes, it may become feasible to target therapeutic interventions in order to achieve more effective maintenance of tissue structure...|$|R
5|$|To be specific, MS {{involves}} {{the loss of}} oligodendrocytes, the cells responsible for creating and maintaining a fatty layer—known as the myelin sheath—which helps the neurons carry electrical signals (action potentials). This results in a thinning or complete loss of myelin and, as the disease advances, {{the breakdown of the}} axons of neurons. When the myelin is lost, a neuron can no longer effectively conduct electrical signals. A <b>repair</b> <b>process,</b> called remyelination, takes place in early phases of the disease, but the oligodendrocytes are unable to completely rebuild the cell's myelin sheath. Repeated attacks lead to successively less effective remyelinations, until a scar-like plaque is built up around the damaged axons. These scars are the origin of the symptoms and during an attack magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often shows more than ten new plaques. This could indicate {{that there are a number}} of lesions below which the brain is capable of repairing itself without producing noticeable consequences. Another process involved in the creation of lesions is an abnormal increase in the number of astrocytes due to the destruction of nearby neurons. A number of lesion patterns have been described.|$|E

The models illustrate the effects of material availability and <b>process</b> redesign on <b>repair</b> cycle time and work-in-process inventory levels for critical components.

25|$|Dry socket is {{more likely}} to occur {{following}} a difficult tooth extraction. It is thought that excessive force applied to the tooth, or excessive movement of the tooth burnishes the bony walls of the socket and crushes blood vessels, impairing the <b>repair</b> <b>process.</b> It has also been shown that dry socket {{is more likely}} to occur when an inexperienced surgeon performed the extraction, possibly because excessive force or excessive tooth movements are used.|$|E
25|$|UVB photons {{can cause}} direct DNA damage. UVB {{radiation}} excites DNA molecules in skin cells, causing aberrant covalent bonds to form between adjacent pyrimidine bases, producing a dimer. Most UV-induced pyrimidine dimers in DNA are removed {{by the process}} known as nucleotide excision repair that employs about 30 different proteins. Those pyrimidine dimers that escape this <b>repair</b> <b>process</b> can induce a form of programmed cell death (apoptosis) or can cause DNA replication errors leading to mutation.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} RAID-Z modes: RAID-Z1 (similar to RAID5, allows one disk to fail), RAID-Z2 (similar to RAID6, allows two disks to fail), and RAID-Z3 (Also {{referred to as}} RAID7 allows three disks to fail). The need for RAID-Z3 arose recently because RAID configurations with future disks (say, 6–10TB) may {{take a long time}} to repair, the worst case being weeks. During those weeks, the rest of the disks in the RAID are stressed more because of the additional intensive <b>repair</b> <b>process</b> and might subsequently fail, too. By using RAID-Z3, the risk involved with disk replacement is reduced.|$|E

40|$|Triticum vulgare {{has been}} {{extensively}} used in traditional medicine thanks to its properties of accelerating tissue repair. The aqueous extract of Triticum vulgare (TVE) is currently an active component used by Farmaceutici Damor {{in the manufacture of}} certain pharmaceutical products already marketed in Italy and abroad under the brand name Fitostimoline(®), in the formulation of cream and medicated gauze and is commonly used for the treatment of decubitus ulcers, sores, burns, scarring delays, dystrophic diseases, and, more broadly, in the presence of problems relating to re-epithelialization or tissue regeneration. The active components of Fitostimoline(®) -based products determine a marked acceleration of tissutal <b>repairing</b> <b>processes,</b> stimulate chemotaxis and the fibroblastic maturation, and significantly increase the fibroblastic index, which are crucial points in the <b>repairing</b> <b>processes.</b> The aim of the present paper was to identify and characterize the active fractions of TVE responsible for the pharmacological effect in tissutal <b>repairing</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1911, it {{was found}} that the {{patients}} often developed pain and hypersensitivity to stimuli during recovery of function. And thus it was thought that the pain associated after stroke was part of the stroke and lesion <b>repair</b> <b>process</b> occurring in the brain. It is now accepted that Dejerine–Roussy syndrome is a condition developed due to lesions interfering with the sensory process, which triggered the start of pharmaceutical and stimulation treatment research. The last 50 years have been filled with refractory treatment research. As of the early 2000s, longer treatments lasting months to years have been explored in the continued search for permanent removal of abnormal pain.|$|E
25|$|DNA damage {{can also}} cause {{epigenetic}} changes. DNA damage is very frequent, occurring on average about 60,000 times a day per cell {{of the human body}} (see DNA damage (naturally occurring)). These damages are largely repaired, but at the site of a DNA repair, epigenetic changes can remain. In particular, a double strand break in DNA can initiate unprogrammed epigenetic gene silencing both by causing DNA methylation as well as by promoting silencing types of histone modifications (chromatin remodeling - see next section). In addition, the enzyme Parp1 (poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase) and its product poly(ADP)-ribose (PAR) accumulate at sites of DNA damage as part of a <b>repair</b> <b>process.</b> This accumulation, in turn, directs recruitment and activation of the chromatin remodeling protein ALC1 that can cause nucleosome remodeling. Nucleosome remodeling has been found to cause, for instance, epigenetic silencing of DNA repair gene MLH1. DNA damaging chemicals, such as benzene, hydroquinone, styrene, carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethylene, cause considerable hypomethylation of DNA, some through the activation of oxidative stress pathways.|$|E
25|$|The first {{measurements}} of photoinhibition {{were published in}} 1956 by Bessel Kok. Even {{in the very first}} studies, it was obvious that plants have a repair mechanism that continuously repairs photoinhibitory damage. In 1966, Jones and Kok measured the action spectrum of photoinhibition and found that ultraviolet light is highly photoinhibitory. The visible-light part of the action spectrum was found to have a peak in the red-light region, suggesting that chlorophylls act as photoreceptors of photoinhibition. In the 1980s, photoinhibition became a popular topic in photosynthesis research, and the concept of a damaging reaction counteracted by a <b>repair</b> <b>process</b> was re-invented. Research was stimulated by a paper by Kyle, Ohad and Arntzen in 1984, showing that photoinhibition is accompanied by selective loss of a 32-kDa protein, later identified as the PSII reaction center protein D1. The photosensitivity of PSII from which the oxygen evolving complex had been inactivated with chemical treatment was studied in the 1980s and early 1990s. A paper by Imre Vass and coworkers in 1992 described the acceptor-side mechanism of photoinhibition. species promote chlorophyll triplet formation|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA|volume=89| year=1992|pages=14081412 |doi = 10.1073/pnas.89.4.1408|issue = 4}} Measurements of production of singlet oxygen by photoinhibited PSII provided further evidence for an acceptor-side-type mechanism. The concept of a repair cycle that continuously repairs photoinhibitory damage, evolved and was reviewed by Aro et al. in 1993. Many details of the repair cycle, including the finding that the FtsH protease {{plays an important role in}} the degradation of the D1 protein, have been discovered since. In 1996, a paper by Tyystjärvi and Aro showed that the rate constant of photoinhibition is directly proportional to light intensity, a result that opposed the former assumption that photoinhibition is caused by the fraction of light energy that exceeds the maximum capability of photosynthesis. The following year, laser pulse photoinhibition experiments done by Itzhak Ohad's group led to the suggestion that charge recombination reactions may be damaging because they can lead to production of singlet oxygen. The molecular mechanism(s) of photoinhibition are constantly under discussion. The newest candidate is the manganese mechanism suggested 2005 by the group of Esa Tyystjärvi. A similar mechanism was suggested by the group of Norio Murata, also in 2005.|$|E

500|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{is a major}} DNA <b>repair</b> <b>process</b> in bacteria. [...] It is {{also important}} for producing genetic diversity in bacterial populations, although the process differs substantially from meiotic recombination, which repairs DNA damages and brings about diversity in eukaryotic genomes. [...] Homologous recombination has been most studied and is best understood for Escherichia coli. [...] Double-strand DNA breaks in bacteria are repaired by the RecBCD pathway of homologous recombination. [...] Breaks that occur on {{only one of the}} two DNA strands, known as single-strand gaps, are thought to be repaired by the RecF pathway. Both the RecBCD and RecF pathways include a series of reactions known as branch migration, in which single DNA strands are exchanged between two intercrossed molecules of duplex DNA, and resolution, in which those two intercrossed molecules of DNA are cut apart and restored to their normal double-stranded state.|$|E
500|$|DNA repair is a {{collection}} of processes by which a cell identifies and corrects damage to the DNA molecules that encode its genome. In human cells, both normal metabolic activities and environmental factors such as radiation can cause DNA damage, resulting in as many as 1 million individual molecular lesions per cell per day. Many of these lesions cause structural damage to the DNA molecule and can alter or eliminate the cell's ability to transcribe the gene that the affected DNA encodes. Other lesions induce potentially harmful mutations in the cell's genome, which affect the survival of its daughter cells after it undergoes mitosis. As a consequence, the DNA <b>repair</b> <b>process</b> is constantly active as it responds to damage in the DNA structure. [...] When normal repair processes fail, and when cellular apoptosis does not occur, irreparable DNA damage may occur, including double-strand breaks and DNA crosslinkages (interstrand crosslinks or ICLs). This can eventually lead to malignant tumors, or cancer as per the two hit hypothesis.|$|E
500|$|The {{air strikes}} did not {{penetrate}} the main armour but nonetheless caused significant {{damage to the}} ship's superstructure and inflicted serious casualties. William Garzke and Robert Dulin report the attack killed 122 men and wounded 316 others, while Hildebrand, Röhr, & Steinmetz report 132 fatalities and 270 wounded men, including the ship's commander, KzS Hans Meyer. Two of the 15cm turrets were destroyed by bombs, and both Ar 196 floatplanes were destroyed. Several of the bomb hits caused serious fires aboard the ship. Concussive shock disabled the starboard turbine engine, and saltwater used to fight the fires reached the boilers and contaminated the feed water. Some [...] of water flooded the ship, primarily through the two holes in the side shell created by shell splinters from near misses. Water used to fight the fires {{also contributed to the}} flooding. Dönitz ordered the ship be repaired, regardless of the cost, {{despite the fact that he}} understood Tirpitz could no longer be used in a surface action because of insufficient fighter support. Repair work began in early May; destroyers ferried important equipment and workers from Kiel to Altafjord over the span of three days. By 2 June, the ship was again able to steam under her own power, and by the end of the month gunnery trials were possible. During the <b>repair</b> <b>process,</b> the 15cm guns were modified to allow their use against aircraft, and specially-fuzed 38cm shells for barrage antiaircraft fire were supplied.|$|E
2500|$|In {{humans and}} other mammals, DNA damage occurs {{frequently}} and DNA <b>repair</b> <b>processes</b> {{have evolved to}} compensate. In estimates made for mice, DNA lesions occur on average 25 to 115 times per minute in each cell, or about 36,000 to 160,000 per cell per day. [...] Some DNA damage may remain in any cell despite the action of <b>repair</b> <b>processes.</b> The accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage is more prevalent in certain types of cells, particularly in non-replicating or slowly replicating cells, such as cells in the brain, skeletal and cardiac muscle.|$|R
