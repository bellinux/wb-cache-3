Study on the {{deterioration}} of the constant current <b>remote</b> <b>feeding</b> system throughout the life of the structure is always {{one of the most important}} issues in seafloor observatory network reliability engineering. Relationship between current-to-current convertor subsystem and amount of loads in branch line is described by introducing failure rate factor. Multistate reliability model of <b>remote</b> power <b>feeding</b> system has been set up and solved by genetic algorithms. Simulation results show that as the load configuration in trunk line and branch line changing, there exists best combination maximizes the system reliability, besides, appropriate increasing amount of loads in branch line can optimize the preventive strategy...|$|R

[...] After the interview, Gibson—unaware that the camera was still rolling {{and that he was}} still on air—took a sip of coffee and used the term [...] "asshole," [...] presumably directed at Richards. Gibson and his publicist both later claimed that the remark was directed at Gibson's publicist; a remark later proven false by insiders who were in the studio with Gibson at the time.|$|E
50|$|The Bradley is {{equipped}} with the M242 25 mm chain gun as its main weapon. The M242 has a single barrel with an integrated dual-feed mechanism and <b>remote</b> <b>feed</b> selection. The gun has 300 rounds of ammunition in two ready boxes (one of 70 rounds, the other of 230 rounds), with an extra 600 rounds in storage (in the M2 Infantry Fighting Vehicle variant) or 1200 stowed rounds (in the M3 Cavalry Fighting Vehicle variant). The two ready boxes allow a selectable mix of rounds, such as the M791 APDS-T (Armor-Piercing Discarding Sabot (with) Tracer) and M792 HEI-T (High Explosive Incendiary (with) Tracer) rounds. The tungsten APDS-T rounds proved highly effective in Desert Storm, being capable of knocking out many Iraqi vehicles including several kills on T-55 tanks. There have even been reports of kills against Iraqi T-72 tanks at close range. Subsequent ammunition developments resulted in the M919 APFSDS-T (Armor-Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot with Tracer) round, which contains a finned depleted uranium penetrator similar in concept to armor-piercing munitions used in modern tanks. The M919 was used in combat during the 2003 invasion phase of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF).|$|E

The 25 mm automatic gun is primarily used for clearing bunkers and firing on lightly armored vehicles. While the 25 mm automatic gun is not the weapon of choice for engaging tanks, vehicle commanders, crews, and CALL and Army Infantry Center personnel reported isolated instances in which the 25 mm automatic gun had killed tanks. However, Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA) officials stated that, {{on the basis of}} their assessment of combat vehicles in the Persian Gulf war, for the 25 mm automatic gun to kill a tank, the tank would have to be hit at close range in its more vulnerable areas. Subsequent ammunition developments resulted in the M919 APFSDS-T (Armor-Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot with Tracer) round, which contains a finned depleted-uranium penetrator similar in concept to armor-piercing munitions used in modern tanks.

40|$|Introduction: It {{has been}} shown by Jung and Tonguz [1] that uplinks in {{personal}} communication system networks can be built using coaxial cable for link lengths 1 / 2 in. Using such cables, no repeater amplifier is necessary to obtain a reasonable dynamic range [1]. From this point of view, the use of optical fibres is necessary for link lengths > 1. 4 km. We show {{that the use of}} optical fibre is actually justified even for much shorter links. Moreover, it is convenient to use repeater amplifiers and higher loss coaxial cable to minimise the costs of the coaxial link. <b>Remote</b> antenna <b>feeding</b> link: If ductings have to be established first, the link costs are of minor importance, or a radio link ma...|$|R
40|$|Two {{different}} optical {{techniques for}} {{the generation of}} low-phase noise millimetre-wave signals have been investigated which are used for the <b>remote</b> <b>feeding</b> of antenna stations in broad-band mobile communication systems. In the first case the signals of two lasers depicting a frequency spacing equal to the desired millimetre-wave frequency were heterodyned in an optic/millimetre-wave converter. The phase noise was suppressed by applying modulation sideband injection locking. This technique simultaneously stabilizes the generated frequency. In the second case only a single laser diode was used. The desired millimetre-wave signal was obtained by optical upconversion applying nonlinear effects caused by the laser chirp {{in combination with the}} fibre dispersion. An experimental system was built up in cooperation with R. Bosch GmbH Hildesheim. Errorfree full duplex operation was demonstrated with 155 Mbit/s data signals in the frequency ranges 18 - 20 and 60 - 70 GHz. Further experimental and theoretical investigations proved the feasability of the optical millimetre-wave technique in multichannel systems. Optic/millimetre-wave converters depicting a high conversion efficiency was developed in cooperation with our partners FhG IAF and DASA. The obtained results of the project demonstrate the advantages of the optical millimetre-wave technique in broadband mobile communication systems. With the two investigated photonic methods low- phase noise millimetre-wave signals were generated offering a high frequency flexibility and stability. Hence remotely fed low-cost antenna stations can be built up, further cost savings are possible by applying this technique in combination with monolithic integration of the necessary components. It was demonstrated experimentally that also the control stations of a mobile communication system can be simplified by using monolithically integrated optical millimetre-wave transmitters comprizing two tunable laser diodes and a waveguide coupler (potonic integrated circuit, PIC).

40|$|In RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tag sys-tems, <b>remote</b> power <b>feeding</b> systems using RF elec-tromagnetic {{induction}} are used. To convert an AC voltage {{provided by}} power receiving coils, AC-DC converters which supply the electric power to signal processing circuits are needed.

In this paper, a charge-pump type AC-DC converter for RFID tags is pro-posed. By using novel bootstrap circuits, the pro-posed converter can avoid the threshold voltage drop caused by diode-switches. Hence the power efficiency of the converter is improved effectively. The valid-ity of the proposed converter is confirmed through SPICE simulations. The SPICE simulations showed that the power efficiency of the proposed converter is more than 85 % and the electric power is about 2 mW when an output load is 500 Ω. Furthermore, the properties concerning power efficiency and ripple voltage are analyzed theoretically...|$|R

However, when precoding techniques are utilized to obtain multi-antenna gains, the system generally requires channel state information (CSI) at the transmitters.

The FeederAnt replaces many stationary feeding tables and reduce the amount of daily manual feeding routines. Further, it is expected that the problem with vermins will be solved since no feed residues will be left within the pens. ...|$|R

It comprises a 4 GHz two-port negative resistance oscillator and a microstrip-patch antenna resonated at 4 GHz. Three different modules are designed and analyzed. The first one used a Lange coupler as a power splitter while the second and third used a one (two) -section branch coupler. The components of the three modules are designed using full-scale computer simulation program named with MSDES, performed by the author, which fully takes into account all the discontinuities included in the microstrip lines, while the modules are analyzed and optimized using APLAC V 7. 61 software. The design methodologies of the two-port negative resistance oscillator and microstrip patch antenna are introduced and explained. The analyses of the designed modules show a better efficiency and good performance. The modules give a transmit-antenna gain of 15. 7 dB with antenna beam widths 91. 7 ◦ and 18. 2 ◦ in E-and H-planes, respectively.

50|$|The Air Force {{decided to}} add a 105 mm cannon to the AC-130J in {{addition}} to the 30 mm cannon and smart bombs, the shells being more accurate and cheaper than dropping SDBs. AFSOC is interested in adding a directed energy weapon to the AC-130J by 2020, similar to the previous Advanced Tactical Laser program. It is to produce a beam of up to 120 kW, or potentially even 180-200 kW, weigh about 5,000 lb, defensively destroy anti-aircraft missiles, and offensively engage communications towers, boats, cars, and aircraft. However, laser armament may only be installed on a few aircraft rather than the entire AC-130J fleet; the laser will be mounted on the side in place of the 30 mm cannon. Other potential additions include an active denial system to perform airborne crowd control, and small unmanned aerial vehicles from the common launch tubes to provide <b>remote</b> video <b>feed</b> and coordinates to weapons operators through cloud cover. Called the Tactical Off-board Sensor (TOBS), the drones would be expendable and fly along a pre-programed orbit to verify targets the aircraft can't see itself because of bad weather or standing off from air defenses. AFSOC will initially utilize the Raytheon Coyote small UAV for the TOBS mission, as it is an off-the-shelf design with a one-hour endurance, but plans to fulfill the role with a new drone capable of a four-hour endurance by 2019.|$|R
