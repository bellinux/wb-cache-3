5|$|Although the Texas Legislature {{typically}} meets {{once every}} two years, a fire destroyed the state capitol building in November 1881, and Ross was called to serve in a special session in April 1882.

5|$|Following the 2008 election, Romney {{laid the}} groundwork for a likely 2012 presidential {{campaign}} by using his Free and Strong America political action committee (PAC) to raise money for other Republican candidates and pay his existing political staff's salaries and consulting fees.

5|$|His {{dispute with}} the General Assembly over the naming of a land {{registrar}} left Garrard embittered, and he retired from politics at the expiration of his second term. He privately backed Christopher Greenup's bid to succeed him in 1804, and Bourbon County's vote broke heavily for Greenup in the election. Although his sons William and James would continue running for public office into the 1830s, Garrard never indicated a desire to <b>run</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although {{he was a}} {{newcomer}} to the Castro District, Milk had shown leadership in the small community. He was starting {{to be taken seriously}} as a candidate and decided to <b>run</b> <b>again</b> for supervisor in 1975. He reconsidered his approach and cut his long hair, swore off marijuana, and vowed never to visit another gay bathhouse again. Milk's campaigning earned the support of the teamsters, firefighters, and construction unions. Castro Camera became the center of activity in the neighborhood. Milk would often pull people off the street to work his campaigns for him—many discovered later that they just happened to be the type of men Milk found attractive.|$|E
5|$|In 1961 Pracheachon's spokesperson, Non Suon, criticized Sihanouk {{for failing}} to tackle inflation, unemployment, and {{corruption}} in the country. Non Suon's criticisms gave Sihanouk the impetus to arrest Pracheachon leaders, and according to him, he had discovered plans by their party to monitor local political developments on behalf of foreign powers. In May 1962 Tou Samouth, Pracheachon's secretary-general, disappeared, and its ideological ally, the Communist Party of Kampuchea, suspected that Samouth had been secretly captured and killed by police. However, Sihanouk allowed Sangkum's left-wing politicians to <b>run</b> <b>again</b> in the 1962 general elections, which they all won. He even appointed two left-wing politicians, Hou Yuon and Khieu Samphan, as secretaries for planning and commerce, respectively, after the election.|$|E

5|$|Passenger {{services}} at the station declined following the Second World War, and the Beeching Report recommended the complete closure of the Portishead line. Passenger {{services at}} Clifton Bridge ended on 7 September 1964, with goods services following on 5 July 1965, although the line saw occasional traffic until 1981. Most of the station was demolished, leaving some remains of the platforms, a retaining wall and the footbridge. Regular freight trains through the station began to <b>run</b> <b>again</b> in 2002 when Royal Portbury Dock {{was connected to the}} rail network. The line is due to be reopened to passenger traffic in 2019 as part of MetroWest, but there are no plans to reopen the station.|$|E
5|$|The first Alabama Constitution, {{ratified}} in 1819, {{provided that}} a governor be elected every two years, limited to serve {{no more than}} four out of every six years. This limit remained in place until the constitution of 1868, which simply allowed governors to serve terms of two years. The current constitution of 1901 increased terms to four years, but prohibited governors from succeeding themselves. Amendment 282 to the constitution, passed in 1968, allowed governors to succeed themselves once; a governor serves two consecutive terms can <b>run</b> <b>again</b> after waiting out the next term. The constitution had no set date for the commencement of a governor's term until 1901, when it was set at the first Monday after the second Tuesday in the January following an election.|$|E
5|$|The state {{constitution}} of 1912 {{called for the}} election of a governor every two years. The term was increased to four years by a 1968 amendment. The constitution originally included no term limit, but an amendment passed in 1992 allows governors to succeed themselves only once; before this, four governors were elected more than twice in a row. Gubernatorial terms begin on the first Monday in the January following the election. Governors who have served the two term limit can <b>run</b> <b>again</b> after four years out of office.|$|E

5|$|Hancock's {{name had}} been {{proposed}} several times for the Democratic nomination for president, but he never captured a majority of delegates. In 1880, however, Hancock's chances improved. President Hayes had promised not to run for a second term, and the previous Democratic nominee, Tilden, declined to <b>run</b> <b>again</b> due to poor health. Hancock faced several competitors for the nomination, including Thomas A. Hendricks, Allen G. Thurman, Stephen Johnson Field, and Thomas F. Bayard. Hancock's neutrality on the monetary question, and his lingering support in the South (owing to his General Order Number 40) meant that Hancock, {{more than any other}} candidate, had nationwide support. When the Democratic convention assembled in Cincinnati in June 1880, Hancock led on the first ballot, but did not have a majority. By the second ballot, Hancock received the requisite two-thirds, and William Hayden English of Indiana was chosen as his running mate.|$|E
5|$|In a {{nationwide}} Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll of 900 registered voters conducted in July 2001, 44 percent of American respondents thought that Condit {{was involved in}} Levy's disappearance and 27 percent felt that he should resign. Fifty-one {{percent of the respondents}} believed that he was acting as if he were guilty; 13 percent felt that he should <b>run</b> <b>again</b> for office. A poll sample taken from Condit's congressional district held a more favorable view of Condit. On March 5, 2002, Condit lost the Democratic primary election for his Congressional seat to his former aide, then-Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza, with the Levy controversy being cited as a contributing factor. He was subpoenaed to appear on April 1, 2002, before a District of Columbia grand jury investigating the disappearance. The date was kept a carefully guarded secret to avoid further leaks. Condit left Congress {{at the end of his}} term on January 3, 2003.|$|E
5|$|In the 1913 session, Coolidge enjoyed renowned {{success in}} arduously {{navigating}} to passage the Western Trolley Act which connected Northampton {{with a dozen}} similar industrial communities in western Massachusetts. Coolidge intended to retire after his second term as was the custom, but when the President of the State Senate, Levi H. Greenwood, considered running for Lieutenant Governor, Coolidge decided to <b>run</b> <b>again</b> for the Senate {{in the hopes of}} being elected as its presiding officer. Although Greenwood later decided to run for reelection to the Senate, he was defeated primarily due to his opposition to women's suffrage; Coolidge was in favor of the women's vote, won his own re-election and with Crane's help, assumed the presidency of a closely divided Senate. After his election in January 1914, Coolidge delivered a published and frequently quoted speech entitled Have Faith in Massachusetts, which summarized his philosophy of government.|$|E
