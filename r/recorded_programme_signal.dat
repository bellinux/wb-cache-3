40|$|Basic {{information}} on the subjective assessment of sound quality is given in ITU-R Recommendation BS. 562 [1]. This advocates the use of two grading scales: one for the subjective assessment of the quality and one for that of the impairment of sound. It also specifies the way of presenting the results. In addition, useful advice is appended on {{the selection of the}} listening panel, on the test procedure and duration, on the choice of programme sequences and reproduction device, on the sound level, and on the listening conditions. One fundamental prerequisite for achieving comparable results in listening tests carried out at different places, is the use of identical test material. For this purpose, EBU experts have selected a number of audio <b>programme</b> <b>signals</b> which have been brought together in an EBU publication comprising a Compact Disc "EBU SQAM " and an explanatory text embodied in EBU document Tech. 3253 [2]. This collection includes <b>programme</b> <b>signals</b> especially chosen to reveal impairments which have been observed in testing both analogue and digital audio systems. Since the variety of gathered material should enable appropriate test signals to be found for almost every task, the EBU recommends the use of this set of audio <b>programme</b> <b>signals</b> for subjective test purposes.

50|$|In {{the early}} days of television, the means of making {{recordings}} of television programmes were limited and programmes were, in the main, transmitted live. This began to change as techniques for <b>recording</b> <b>programmes</b> onto film (telerecording) and, later, videotape were developed in the 1950s. Even after the technology for <b>recording</b> <b>programmes</b> had become the norm, it was a common practice, due to a combination of the costs of storage and restrictions on broadcasting repeats, for UK broadcasters to wipe programmes after transmission. As a result, John Cura's tele-snaps are often the only surviving record of many lost programmes from the early years of television.|$|R

50|$|By 1936 {{a number}} of {{gramophone}} recordings had been made, and a temporary secretary, Marie Slocombe was given the task of sorting and disposing of them.

With the then Head of <b>Recorded</b> <b>Programmes,</b> Lynton Fletcher, she continued maintaining the BBC's collection, as well as making recordings herself in the field, encouraging others to do so, and acquired Ludwig Koch's collection of birdsong recordings. By 1939 the collection had grown to 2,000 discs, including the voices of Hitler and Goebbels.
