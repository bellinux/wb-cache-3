5|$|The {{proposed}} <b>redefinition</b> was criticised as ambiguous: Astronomer Phil Plait and NCSE writer Nick Matzke both {{wrote about}} why they thought the <b>redefinition</b> was not, in general, a good one. It defined a planet as orbiting a star, which would have meant that any planet ejected from its star system or formed outside of one (a rogue planet) {{could not have been}} called a planet, even if it fit all other definitions. A similar situation already applied to the term 'moon', such bodies ceasing to be moons on being ejected from planetary orbit; this usage had widespread acceptance. Similarly, the <b>redefinition</b> did not differentiate between planets and brown dwarf stars. Any attempt to clarify this differentiation was to be left until a later date.|$|E

5|$|Later {{authors have}} reassigned the sharptooth houndshark to the genus Triakis, more {{specifically}} to the subgenus Cazon alongside the sharpfin houndshark (T. acutipinna) and the spotted houndshark (T. maculata). A 2006 phylogenetic study by J. Andrés López and colleagues, based on four protein-coding gene sequences, found that this species did not group with the leopard shark (T. semifasciata). Instead, it and the flapnose houndshark (Scylliogaleus quecketti) formed a clade within the Mustelus lineage. This result suggests that the two subgenera of Triakis—Cazon and Triakis—may not be closely related, which would warrant a <b>redefinition</b> of the genus.|$|E

5|$|There {{had also}} been {{criticism}} of the proposed definition of double planet: at present the Moon {{is defined as a}} satellite of the Earth, but over time the Earth-Moon barycenter will drift outwards (see tidal acceleration) and could eventually become situated outside of both bodies. This development would then upgrade the Moon to planetary status at that time, according to the <b>redefinition.</b> The time taken for this to occur, however, would be billions of years, long after many astronomers expect the Sun to expand into a red giant and destroy both Earth and Moon.|$|E
5|$|Weber {{began his}} {{studies of the}} subject in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, in which {{he argued that the}} <b>redefinition</b> of the {{connection}} between work and piety in Protestantism and especially in ascetic Protestant denominations, particularly Calvinism, shifted human effort towards rational efforts aimed at achieving economic gain. In Protestant religion, Christian piety towards God was expressed through one's secular vocation (secularisation of calling).

5|$|Alison Young {{argues that}} Jackson entrenched section 2(1) of the Parliament Act 1911 by {{requiring}} {{that it only}} be overturned by adopting a specific manner and form (approval of the bill changing the 1911 Act by the House of Lords). She suggests that Lord Steyn and Baroness Hale would explain this result using a self-embracing view of sovereignty – that Parliament {{as a whole is}} sovereign and can therefore to bind later parliaments. The passing of the 1911 Act was from this perspective a <b>redefinition</b> of Parliament that binds the courts. However, she notes that Lord Hope, Lord Nicholls and Lord Carswell provide an alternative explanation for the decision: that the 1911 Act modified the rule of recognition defining valid legal documents. Under this view, the 1911 Parliament did not bind future Parliaments simply by passing the Parliament Act 1911, but by the legislation being recognised, in political fact, as valid; the courts were therefore altering the legal rule of recognition accordingly. This perspective allows the orthodox continuing view of parliamentary sovereignty (that every new parliament is sovereign) to be held while still explaining why future parliaments cannot modify section 2(1) of the 1911 Act.|$|E
40|$|The {{apparent}} {{dependence of}} nuclear matter observables on off-shell {{properties of the}} two-nucleon potential is re-examined {{in the context of}} effective field theory (EFT). Finite density (thermodynamic) observables are invariant under field <b>redefinitions,</b> which extends the well-known theorem about the invariance of S-matrix elements. Simple examples demonstrate how field <b>redefinitions</b> can shift contributions between purely off-shell two-body interactions and many-body forces, leaving both scattering and finite-density observables unchanged. If only the transformed two-body potentials are kept, however, the nuclear matter binding curves will depend on the off-shell part (generating “Coester bands”). The correspondence between field <b>redefinitions</b> and unitary transformations, which have traditionally been used to generate “phase-equivalent ” nucleon-nucleon potentials, is also demonstrated...|$|R

The perturbative superpotential is not holomorphic in the couplings due to finite contributions. However, there exist coupling constant <b>redefinitions</b> that restore holomorphy.

5|$|In 1970, Boeing's 747 {{became the}} first {{wide-body}} jetliner to enter service. The 747 was the first passenger jet wide enough to feature a twin-aisle cabin. Two years later, the manufacturer began a development study, code-named 7X7, for a new wide-body aircraft intended to replace the 707 and other early generation narrow-body jets. The aircraft would also provide twin-aisle seating, but in a smaller fuselage than the existing 747, McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and Lockheed L-1011 TriStar wide-bodies. To defray {{the high cost of}} development, Boeing signed risk-sharing agreements with Italian corporation Aeritalia and the Civil Transport Development Corporation (CTDC), a consortium of Japanese aerospace companies. This marked the manufacturer's first major international joint venture, and both Aeritalia and the CTDC received supply contracts in return for their early participation. The initial 7X7 was conceived as a short take-off and landing airliner intended for short-distance flights, but customers were unenthusiastic about the concept, leading to its <b>redefinition</b> as a mid-size, transcontinental-range airliner. At this stage the proposed aircraft featured two or three engines, with possible configurations including over-wing engines and a T-tail.|$|E
5|$|The International Prototype Kilogram was {{commissioned}} by the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) {{under the authority of}} the Metre Convention (1875), and in the custody of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) who hold it on behalf of the CGPM. After the International Prototype Kilogram had been found to vary in mass over time relative to its reproductions, the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) recommended in 2005 that the kilogram be redefined in terms of a fundamental constant of nature. At its 2011 meeting, the CGPM agreed in principle that the kilogram should be redefined in terms of the Planck constant. The decision was originally deferred until 2014; in 2014 it was deferred again until the next meeting. There are currently several different proposals for the <b>redefinition</b> (some of which have been abandoned); these are described in the Proposed Future Definitions section below.|$|E
