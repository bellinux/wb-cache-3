He declined the offer {{on the grounds that}} the proposals were predominantly motivated by political interests rather than the common well-being. However, he continued to advise the authorities on various aspects of <b>rural</b> <b>development,</b> such as participatory irrigation management. He worked as a research fellow at the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad from 1971 to 1972, and as Director of Rural Economics Research Project at Karachi University from 1972 to 1973.

Between 1954 and 1955, he took a break to work as director of the Village Agricultural and Industrial Development (V-AID) Programme. However, he was not satisfied with the development approach adopted in the programme that was limited to the training of villagers. In 1958, he went to Michigan State University to acquire education and training in <b>rural</b> <b>development.</b> Returning in 1959, he established the Pakistan Academy for <b>Rural</b> <b>Development</b> (PARD) at Comilla on 27 May 1959 and was appointed as its founding director. He also laid foundations for the Comilla Cooperative Pilot Project in 1959. In 1963, he received a Ramon Magsaysay Award from the Government of the Philippines for his services in <b>rural</b> <b>development.</b> Khan became Vice-chairman of the board of Governors of PARD in 1964, and in the same year, was awarded an honorary Doctorate of law by Michigan State University. In 1969, he delivered a series of lectures at Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University, based on his experience with rural cooperatives. During the visit, he established collaborative links with Arthur Lewis.|$|E

40|$|By {{selecting}} the panel data from 2001 to 2008 {{in central and}} western regions, I adopt the methods of covariance analysis test, Hausman test, panel unit root test and co-integration test to conduct empirical research on the interactive relationship between agricultural insurance and <b>rural</b> financial <b>development</b> in central and western regions. The results {{show that there is}} a long-term balanced and interactive causal relationship between agricultural insurance and <b>rural</b> financial <b>development</b> in central and western regions. The agricultural insurance in western regions is the cause or <b>rural</b> financial <b>development,</b> while such relationship in central regions is not tenable. There is an interactive promotion relationship between agricultural insurance and <b>rural</b> financial <b>development</b> efficiency in central regions. While the relationship between agricultural insurance and <b>rural</b> financial <b>development</b> efficiency in western regions is mutually inhibitive, but the rural financial efficiency in western regions promotes the development of agricultural insurance. Then corresponding suggestions are put forward in order to give full play to the role of mutual promotion between agricultural insurance and <b>rural</b> financial <b>development</b> as follows: reinforce the support degree for policy finance in central and western regions; increase the inputs of rural financial institutions in sewing agriculture, countryside and farmers; expand the types and coverage of policy agricultural insurance.
