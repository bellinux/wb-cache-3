40|$|A <b>regenerative</b> <b>adsorption</b> cycle {{based on}} the use of {{low-cost}} tubular modules arranged in a multirow bed is described. It is a variety of 'thermal wave' cycle, capable of a very high coefficient of performance (COP). Detailed simulations of system performance have been carried out using measured carbon heat transfer and porosity data. Depending upon a suitable choice of heating fluid flowrate and time between flow reversals, it is possible to achieve air conditioning COPs in excess of 1. 1, albeit at a very low specific coding power (SCP) of 10 W/kg. The same machine can be operated to achieve a range of COP and SCP combinations, depending on the control strategy...|$|E
40|$|Polluted air streams can be {{purified}} using biological treatments such as biotrickling filtration, {{which is}} one of the most widely accepted techniques successfully tuned to treat a wide variety of exhausted gaseous streams coming from a series of industrial sectors such as food processing, flavor manufacturers, rendering, and composting. Since the degradation of a pollutant occurs at standard pressure and temperature, biotrickling filtration, whether compared with other more energy-demanding chemical-physical processes of abatement (such as scrubbing, catalytic oxidation, <b>regenerative</b> <b>adsorption,</b> incineration, advanced oxidation processes, etc.), represents a very high energy-efficient technology. Moreover, as an additional advantage, biodegradation offers the possibility of a complete mineralization of the polluting agents. In this work, biotrickling filtration has been considered in order to explore its efficiency with respect to the abatement of ammonia (which is a highly water-soluble compound). Moreover, a complete mathematical model has been developed in order to describe the dynamics of both absorption and biological activities which are the two dominant phenomena occurring into these systems. The results obtained in this work have shown that the absorption phenomenon is very important in order to define the global removal efficiency of ammonia from the gaseous stream (particularly, 44...|$|E
40|$|Spacecraft being {{developed}} for future exploration missions incorporate Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) that limit weight, power, and volume thus requiring systems {{with higher levels}} of efficiency while maintaining high dependability and robustness. For air revitalization, an approach that meets those goals utilizes a <b>regenerative</b> Vacuum-Swing <b>Adsorption</b> (VSA) system that removes 100 % of the CO 2 from the cabin atmosphere as well as 100 % of the water. A Sorbent Based Atmosphere Revitalization (SBAR) system is a VSA system that utilizes standard commercial adsorbents that have been proven effective and safe in spacecraft including Skylab and the International Space Station. The SBAR system {{is the subject of a}} development, test, and evaluation program that is being conducted at NASA s Marshall Space Flight Center. While previous testing had validated that the technology is a viable option, potential improvements to system design and operation were identified. Modifications of the full-scale SBAR test articles and adsorption cycles have been implemented and have shown significant performance gains resulting in a decrease in the consumables required for a mission as well as improved mission safety. Previous testing had utilized single bed test articles, during this period the test facility was enhanced to allow testing on the full 2 -bed SBAR system. The test facility simulates a spacecraft ECLSS and allows testing of the SBAR system over the full range of operational conditions using mission simulations that assess the real-time performance of the SBAR system during scenarios that include the metabolic transients associated with extravehicular activity. Although future manned missions are currently being redefined, the atmosphere revitalization requirements for the spacecraft are expected to be quite similar to the Orion and the Altair vehicles and the SBAR test program addressed validation to the defined mission requirements as well as operation in other potential vehicle architectures. The development program, including test articles, the test facility, and tests and results through early 2011 is discussed...|$|R
