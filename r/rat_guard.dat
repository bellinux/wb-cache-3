50|$|Reed {{returns to}} {{headquarters}} {{to discover that}} a reporter (Dan Riss) is threatening to break the story that a pathogenic bacteria is endangering the city. Reed is impressed when the deeply committed yet unorthodox Warren throws the reporter into jail to keep him quiet. Late in the evening, a beleaguered Reed returns home {{for a few hours}} of sleep, and his wife announces that she is pregnant. She then tries to restore her husband's flagging self-confidence. A few hours later, Reed and Warren learn that the mayor is angry about their treatment of the reporter. The reporter, who has been released, announces that the story will appear in the morning paper in four hours, giving Reed and Warren little time to find their man. Meanwhile, Blackie goes to Poldi's room and tries to force him to reveal information about some smuggled goods, but the dying Poldi is delirious and only rants nonsensically. Blackie then brings in his own doctor and tells Poldi's grandmother that they will take care of him. Just then, Reed, having been tipped off by the nurse looking after Poldi, arrives, and Blackie and Fitch, who are carrying Poldi down the stairs, pitch the man over the side and flee. Reed chases the two to the docks, where he tries to explain to them about the plague. The men run desperately through depots, docks and a warehouse, and at one point, Warren shoots and injures Blackie, preventing him from shooting Reed. Blackie accidentally shoots Fitch and then tries to struggle onto a ship but, exhausted, he is unable to pass a <b>rat</b> <b>guard</b> on the mooring line, and falls into the water. His work finally done, Reed heads for home, and on the way, Warren offers to give him some of the smuggled perfume that Poldi had indeed received from Kochak. As the radio announces the resolution of the crisis, a proud Nancy greets her husband.|$|E
25|$|As {{the number}} of prisoners at the camp {{increased}} {{in the summer of}} 1864, the War Department again reduced rations, in retaliation for the Confederates reducing rations for Union prisoners. Rations reportedly no longer lasted quite as long as the period for which they were allotted. A few prisoners reported that prisoners resorted to eating <b>rats.</b> <b>Guards</b> punished anyone caught taking bones from the garbage by tying the bone in the prisoner's mouth and making him crawl around like a dog. As the length of confinements increased {{due to the lack of}} prisoner exchanges, more fights between prisoners arose. Other prisoners usually broke them up before guards intervened. Work details were still required.|$|R
50|$|Ratz is a Canadian/French {{animated}} {{television series}} created by France's Xilam studios, with joint production from Canada.The show stars two rats, Rapido and Razmo, aboard the S.S. Wanderer, a cheese ship with (seemingly) no actual destination. The {{focus of the}} series is on the adventures of the two <b>rats,</b> including <b>guarding</b> the cheese, interacting with other stowaways and various ill-fated encounters with the crew. The rats themselves live in the hull of the ship in a lavish two-bedroom apartment.|$|R

She is led back in by Mr. Ages (who now has his leg bandaged up) and is amazed to see the rats' use of electricity and other technology. She meets Nicodemus and Justin, the Captain of the Guard, and a ruthless, power-hungry rat named Jenner.|$|R

The ninjas are eventually driven off by Snake Eyes, Jinx, and Tiger Claw.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} records surrounding {{development of}} the Standard Schnauzer in Germany come from the late 19th century. They were originally bred to be medium-sized farm dogs in Germany, equally suited to <b>ratting,</b> herding, and <b>guarding</b> property. As time passed, farmers bred the Standard Schnauzer into a smaller, more compact size for ratting by combining it with the Affenpinscher and Miniature Poodle. The first recorded Miniature Schnauzer appeared in 1888, and the first exhibition was held in 1899.|$|R

But as soon as she entered the room she saw a terrible army of <b>rats,</b> who were <b>guarding</b> the straw bed; and when she attempted to approach it they sprang at her, biting and scratching furiously. Quite terrified, she drew back, crying out: [...] "Oh! my dear pinks, how can you stay here in such bad company?" ...|$|R
50|$|Large, {{aggressive}} bandicoot <b>rats</b> erect their <b>guard</b> {{hairs on}} their backs and emit grunts when disturbed. If caged with other bandicoots, {{it is likely to}} fight to death within a few hours. Usually, they occupy the outskirts of human dwellings such as compounds and gardens and are commonly found near garbage bins. Their burrowing habits cause great damage to grounds and flooring, as they can also tunnel through brick and masonry. Their characteristic large burrows give away their presence. They are not fastidious eaters, feeding on household refuse, grain, and vegetables, and are very serious pests in poultry farms. They are also a carrier for many diseases.|$|R
60|$|It was {{certainly}} a good word to conjure with: {{you could see it}} by the squirming of these <b>rats.</b> The queen's <b>guards</b> fell into line, and she and they marched away, with their torch-bearers, and woke the echoes of the cavernous tunnels with the measured beat of their retreating footfalls. I had the prisoner taken from the rack and placed upon his bed, and medicaments applied to his hurts, and wine given him to drink. The woman crept near and looked on, eagerly, lovingly, but timorously,--like one who fears a repulse; indeed, she tried furtively to touch the man's forehead, and jumped back, the picture of fright, when I turned unconsciously toward her. It was pitiful to see.|$|R

Fox learns that the farmers {{plan to use}} Kristofferson to lure him into an ambush and heads to the surface to surrender, which would mean his demise. The animals are confronted by <b>Rat,</b> Bean's security <b>guard,</b> who attacks Ash and Felicity. Hearing his son's cries, Fox returns and fights Rat in an electrical room until Fox pushes him into an electric generator, electrocuting him. Before dying, Rat confesses Kristofferson's location. Fox asks the farmers for a meeting in town near the sewer hub where he would surrender in exchange for Kristofferson's freedom. The farmers set up an ambush, but Fox and the others anticipate it and launch a counterattack.|$|R
40|$|In the {{hypophysectomized}} <b>rat</b> {{which is}} <b>guarded</b> from contact with steroids in the ration and environment, the uterus and vagina are atrophic but they remain highly {{responsive to the}} difunctional steroids (1) which promote their growth and hence compose an assay system. Utilizing it {{we have found that}} functional groups at positions 3 and 17 in the steroids mentioned participate in the induction of growth, but that these physiologically active centers are equivalent neither in quantitative effects nor in the type of growth which they evoke. The state of oxidation at both sites and the degree of saturation of the A and B rings {{have much to do with}} determining the quantity and the pattern of the growth response. In order to evaluate the importance of the individual structural elements of steroid hormones in accelerating cell growth, an investigation was made of steroids possessing an oxygen function at either position 3 or position 17 but not at both sites. The results to be set forth in this present paper demonstrate that in such monofunctional steroids of the androstane series the possessio...|$|R
40|$|Mating {{strategies}} {{describe a}} set of social and sexual behaviors that an individual, or a species uses in order to reproduce. The two ends of the spectrum of mating strategies are promiscuity, where an individual mates {{with a variety of}} partners, and monogamy, where individuals form enduring bonds and preferentially copulate with one another. However, much evidence exists, demonstrating that {{there is a great deal}} of flexibility within each of these mating strategies. The three chapters of this thesis were designed to understand how far the mating strategy of the female rat could be shifted, from promiscuity to monogamy, by assessing whether or not female rats would display mate guarding behavior. Chapter 1 showed that sexually na√Øve female rats, if given all of their rewarding sexual experience with the same male, would mate guard that male in the presence of a female competitor through female-female mounting. When female <b>rats</b> mate <b>guarded,</b> it they displayed more Fos induction within areas known to be involved in pair bonding and stress. Chapter 2 showed that the Fos induction seen within bonding regions was within oxytocin and vasopressin neurons. We also show that oxytocin and vasopressin are important for conditioned mate guarding behavior, by peripherally administering either oxytocin or vasopressin to females prior to their first sexual experience then subsequently testing them 4 days later for mate guarding. Both vasopressin and oxytocin were able to facilitate mate guarding. Chapter 3 explored the contribution of histone methylation to creating the enhanced expression of oxytocin and vasopressin we observed in chapter two. By pharmacologically blocking the action of LSD 1 demethylases we were able to show that the enhanced expression of oxytocin and vasopressin are essential for the onset of mate guarding. Females treated with the LSD 1 inhibitor failed to display mate guarding and did not show an enhanced expression of oxytocin or vasopressin. Together, these data demonstrate the flexibility within the mating strategy of female rats, and that their first experiences with mating and sexual reward influence the subsequent expression of their mating strategy which is sub served by neuromolecular and epigenetic mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|It is {{estimated}} that 80 % of all seed used by farmers in the tropics is derived from stocks held on-farm from previous seasons. If yields are to be sustained and even increased {{it is essential that}} seed storage is of a consistently high standard. Good quality seed is central to productive agriculture. Poor planting material results in poor field establishment and ultimately poor yields, irrespective of subsequent inputs. Farmers choose to maintain their own seed stocks for a variety of reasons: the formal seed sector cannot, or does not, provide those varieties which farmers prize; the cost of buying fresh seed of 'improved' varieties on a regular basis is prohibitive; and because it appears that farmer selection of seed stocks often allows maintenance of yield levels under small-scale conditions. Because of the relatively small quantities involved and because sorting and planting are done by hand, farmers can select the largest seeds and those that are free of insect and mould attack, thereby ensuring plant-seeds with maximal vigour. Despite this preponderance of farmer-held material, very little attention has been directed towards assisting farmers in maintaining their seed stocks in the best possible condition. Grain stored for food and grain held as seed face many of the same problems, such as insect and rodent infestation and mould attack, and hence many lessons learnt from experience with grain storage {{can be applied to the}} seed situation. However, food grain seeds are only useful if they remain viable. Since seeds are more sensitive to the effects of temperature and humidity than food grain stocks, they need to be handled with additional care in order to maintain their germination potential. Agricultural development programmes that have a seed component often start with the premise that on-farm storage of seed must necessarily be inadequate and in need of improvement. These assumptions are rarely supported with survey or experimental data and their validity needs to be questioned. Indigenous knowledge With increasing appreciation of indigenous technical knowledge some studies have been undertaken to document farmer seed-saving practices. These studies show that farmers actively select planting material which they may then handle and treat in a different way to their food grain. In Zimbabwe detailed qualitative studies show clearly that farmers have an extensive understanding of techniques which maximize seed performance. Such documentation of farmer practices is extremely useful but it is also important that some quantitative measure of success can be attributed to the various techniques. The organization Seeds of Survival working in central Ethiopia has, from preliminary data, established that germination levels of farm saved seed, from a variety of crops, was above 70 % after six months storage in 85 % of their samples. These findings are supported by a more extensive survey undertaken by staff of the Natural Resources Institute, UK, with collaborating national institutes in Ghana, Malawi and Tanzania. A total of 1, 859 samples of five important crops were taken from farmers' seed stocks and assessed for germination potential just prior to planting. Maize, cowpeas and soya showed mean germination levels of above 75 % whilst beans and groundnut were less consistent, though still good. Until now, these quantitative studies have been carried out in countries or regions where the climate is conducive to successful seed storage, having significant dry seasons during which seeds can be conditioned before being placed in store. Whether or not farmer techniques are equally successful under hot humid conditions has yet to be established. In terms of volume, farmer seed requirements are often small. This means that farmers can invest more time, effort and care into the maintenance of seed quality than would be practicable for food grain stocks. Often this simply means using a sealable container to prevent insect attack. Alternatively, farmers apply traditional or insecticidal admixtures to control or prevent insect infestation. For example, some farmers in northern Ghana mix their cowpea seeds with shea nut oil, which appears to have an excellent repellent effect on bean bruchids. Other farmers, who store their maize seeds as suspended cobs, cover them with plastic sheeting or gourd shards as <b>rat</b> <b>guards.</b> These farmer initiatives are often very localized, despite being useful components of a seed storage strategy. Further studies would allow extension staff to decide which of these indigenous practices could usefully be more widely advertised. In addition, strategies that already have proven advantages but which are not universally adopted, should be promoted: for example, the selection of maize seed at harvest rather than just before the following planting season. Is change necessary? In the areas investigated it seems unlikely that at the farmer level, seed storage practices need to be drastically altered. Farmer techniques work sufficiently well and the only rationale for a radical change m storage practices would be if some major external change took place. This could include declining availability of traditional materials used as admixtures such as botanical insecticides because of over-cropping, unusual weather patterns, or the appearance of a novel pest against which traditional measures are ineffective (e. g. larger grain borer). It is clear that in zones that have a climate suited to seed storage, farmers are frequently very accomplished at E maintaining the viability of their own seed stocks. The techniques employed, which may have evolved over considerable periods of time, are usually well adapted to the farming. system in which they are used. However, there is room for improvement to many of the current practices through farmers learning from each other. Change can be brought about through awareness activities. This could take several forms, such as direct advice or through information exchanges, allowing farmers to become aware of techniques used successfully in other areas of the country. In this respect researchers and extension staff are most suited to act in the role of facilitators through the establishment of 'best practices' from among the range of techniques available, supporting farmer-based technologies and only offering totally new practices where the local systems can be shown to be failing. It {{is estimated}} that 80 % of all seed used by farmers in the tropics is derived from stocks held on-farm from previous seasons. If yields are to be sustained and even increased it is essential that seed storage is of a consistently high standard [...] . ...|$|R
