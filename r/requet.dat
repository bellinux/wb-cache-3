40|$|The {{termination}} of the late pregnancy causes legal, medical and ethical dilemmas. This {{is due to the}} development of fetus if pregnancy is late one and complexity of the needed medical procedures. Legal regime of the {{termination of}} late pregnancy contains special conditions: legally stipulated indications and special procedure which means getting permission from particular body for the termination. In this article author compares legal regimes in: United Kingdom, France, Germany, Nordic countries, Switzerland, Italy, Russia, Check Republic and Serbia. Universal definition of the late pregnancy does not exist, but pregnancy after 24 weeks is considered late in Dutch law, and in the legal theory in United Kingdom. The time limit for {{termination of the}} pregnancy in some legislation is 24 weeks (e. g. Check Republic and Finland). According to Serbian law, there is a distinction of the pregnancy until 10 weeks, when termination is possible on pregnant woman's request, from 10 to 20 weeks when termination is decided by consilium of the physicians and after to 20 weeks when termination is decided by ethical committee. In the domestic law there is no distinction of the necessary indications for termination of the pregnancy after 10 weeks and after 20 weeks. Author suggest amendments to exisiting solutions. One, to postpone the termination on the <b>requets</b> until 12 weeks, and to stipulate different indications necessary for the termination pregnancy from 12 to 24 weeks and after 24 weeks - late pregnancy, {{in order to make the}} termination of the late pregnancy really exceptional...|$|R

Faculty of Tarbiyah and Teacher Training. State Islamic Institute (IAIN) of Tulungagung. Advisor: Nany Soengkono Madayani, S. S, M. Pd. Kata kunci : Speech Act, Illocutionary Acts, Context. 	Illocutionary act {{is called}} by the act of doing {{something}}. It is only used for informing something, but also doing something as far as speech event was accurate considered. In this research the writer would like to analysis the illocutionary acts be found in animation movie "Zootopia". This movie directed by Byron Howard, Rich Moore and written by Jared Bush. The movie has been released on March 4, 2016. The film also starring several artists and actors like Jason Bateman, Ginnifer Goodwin, Nick Wild, Lt. Judy Hopps. 	 This film {{tells the story of}} a fox who lived in a town called Zootopia. A modern city inhabited by the animals. Fox is trying to become a famous animal in the city but a fox who experienced a very strange events. However, due to a conspiracy of making her a fugitive for committing crimes though he had never done, Zootopia‘s Police then mediate the issue. He is the rabbit selfish, self-righteous. However, the fox and the rabbit was subjected to a conspiracy by certain groups. They were forced to join and realize that the enemy can also be a good friend and finally they cooperate in solve the problem and find the truth. 	The formulation of the research problems were: 1) what types of illocutionary acts are found in the movie script of zootopia? 2) what illocutionary forces are found in movie script of zootopia uttered by the main character? 	The objectives of this research were to: 1) To recognize the types of the illocutionary acts types found in the movie of Zootopia. 2) To analyze the illocutionary forces in the movie of the Zootopia uttered by the main character. 	The writer uses qualitative descriptive analysis method. The writer collects the data from movie’s script, then describes contexts and classification of illocutionary acts. Based on the theories provided, the data are analyzed one by one to know the context and types of illocutionary acts used. To focus on the study, the writer limits herself to analyze five types of illocutionary acts. 	From the analysis, the writer finds five types of illocutionary acts used by Judy Hopps as main character in zootopia movie. They are Representative: asserting, concluding, assessing. Diractive: <b>requeting,</b> ordering, advising. Commissive: promising, threatening, offering, warning. Expressive: apologizing, thanking, welcoming, like. Declarative: arrestin...|$|R

Network system of elevator itself performs based on the user’s demand to bring them on each destination. In fulfilling user’s heterogeneous need from upward and downward moving from the floors upstairs or even downstairs then there should be work slot of network system whether it is mechanic or even electric from this elevator miniature. Then, this work slot can be made as the reference to make logical program in the form of Flowchart. The slot diagram determines a work function of the program in moving the work from electrical and mechanical system of the miniature elevator itself. CodeVision AVR is a program tool to implement logical program of elevator work on electrical system, ATMEGA 8535, to move mechanical system of the elevator.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the need for}} intermediate handling of multicast data while it traverses the net from a multicast source to its receivers. The proposed concept of dynamic manycasting hierarchies is a fusion of both multicast and anycast methodologies. The concept {{is designed to be}} transparent and does not require any modifications to be made to the existing multicast and anycast delivery protocols. By adding a distributed intermediate entity that keeps track of receivers and dynamically selects the best way to deliver multicast data we not only achieve faster data delivery and higher level of security, but also provide a framework for future protocol extensions and added functionality without making any global changes to the multicasting protocols themselves. In particular, manycasting hierarchies address the problem of having anycast addresses as members of multicast groups, shifting the load from a multicast source. Since there is a number of servers that replicate the data from a source there are also less failures caused by congestion and routing problems. Another important factor is that the transmission of data to end-clients is not limited to multicast per se, and can be done based on an end-client's <b>requet</b> using various protocols, including unicast, broadcast, and reliable multicast. Finally, by using interim source hopping, where various parts of a multicast message are being received by a client from different sources, a potentially high level of security can be achieved. Since the manycasting hierarchy that performs an extra security function on multicast data knows about its end-clients, {{it is much easier to}} provide verification and authentication and it is no longer necessary to utilize complex reliable multicast disciplines that would otherwise be used by an end-client to talk to a multicast source...|$|E

ExampleDataSet. ##Guidelines to use {{the data}} and {{programs}} in the repository. There are two ways that this repository can be useful for anyone that needs data about VNFs and their traffic on the cloud. 1. Directly use the already generated data set. 2. Generate your own data set using the given programs. ##How {{to use the}} already generated data set: ExampleDataSet. We have generated data for: 1. Possible policy requests with initial traffic passing through them defined. 2. Scaling requirements for each 15 minutes for 2 days. 3. Topology data (nodes, links, paths) for K-Fat Tree, BCube and VL 2 architectures with 64 servers. You can use these data directly as inputs for your experiments. ##How to use the programs and generate the required data sets. If you want to generate your own data sets according to your requirements, {{you can use the}} given programs. 1) First step is to generate the policy requests data set using the policy requests generation program: GeneratePolicies. - Inputs to the program: number of large scaled enterprise networks. - Output of the program: a set of policies for each enterprise with 100 NFs. 2) After we have created the policy <b>requets</b> data set, the seconds step is to create the traffic data set for the policies using the initial traffic distribution program: DistributeTrafficOverPolicies. - Inputs to the program: the set of policies, initial traffic load. - Output of the program: distribution of the traffic load over policies. 3) The third step is to create the scaling requirements data set to reflect the traffic changes over the time using the scaling requirements over the time program: PoliciesToChange. 4) The last step is to generate the required topology data for different network architectures (K-Fat tree, BCube, VL 2) using the topology generation program: TopologyCreator. - Inputs to the program: network architecture and number of servers. - Output of the program: the topology: nodes, links and paths. Network Function Virtualization (NFV) proposes to move packet processing from dedicated hardware middle-boxes to software running on commodity servers: virtualized Network Function (NFs) (i. e, Firewall, Proxy, Intrusion Detection System etc.). We have been developing an experimental platform called Network Function Center (NFC) to study issues related to NFV and NFs, assuming that the NFC will deliver virtualized NFs as a service to clients on a subscription basis. Our studies specially focus on dynamic resource allocation for NFs and we have proposed two new resource allocation algorithms based on Genetic Programming (GP) [1] and currently working on another algorithm based on Iterative Local Search. For a more realistic evaluation of these algorithms, testing data is a fundamental component, but unfortunately, public traffic data specifically referring to virtualized NFs chains is not readily available. Therefore, we developed a model to generate the specific data we needed, based on the available general traffic data [2]. This repository contains all the details about how we modelled general data into the specific data we wanted, with along the software we used and the assumptions we made during the data modelling process. Using this data and programs, the evaluation results presented in our publications can be easily reproduced. [1] W. Rankothge, J. Ma, F. Le, A. Russo, and J.
