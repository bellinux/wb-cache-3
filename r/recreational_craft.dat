2500|$|The Tennessee River has {{historically}} been a major highway for riverboats through the south and today they are still found along the river in abundance. Major ports include Guntersville, Chattanooga, Decatur, and Yellow Creek, and Muscle Shoals. Navigation has contributed greatly to the economic and industrial development of the Tennessee Valley as a whole. The economies of cities like Decatur and Chattanooga {{would not be as}} dynamic as they are today, {{were it not for the}} Tennessee River. Many companies still rely on the river as a means of transportation for their materials. In Chattanooga, for example, steel is exported on boats, as it is much more efficient than moving it on land. Locks along the Tennessee River waterway provide passage between reservoirs for more than 13,000 <b>recreational</b> <b>craft</b> each year. The Chickamauga Dam, located just upstream from Chattanooga, is currently planned to have a new lock built. [...] However, the project has been delayed due to a lack of funding. The river not only has many economic functions, such as the boat building industry and transportation, but it also provides water and natural resources to those who live near the river. Many of the major ports on the river are connected to a settlement that was started because of its proximity to the river.|$|E

This authorization allows these entities performing effective inspections and technical controls {{of pleasure}} <b>craft.</b> <b>Recreational</b> <b>crafts</b> are subjected to surveys that are based on the registration list and hull construction material.

40|$|Harbours, {{which are}} often characterised by {{anthropogenic}} stress in combination with intensive international ship traffic, {{tend to be very}} susceptible to aquatic invasions. Since alien macrocrustaceans are known to be very successful across many European waters, a study was made on their distribution and impact in the four Belgian coastal harbours (Nieuwpoort, Ostend, Blankenberge and Zeebrugge). Biological and physical–chemical data were gathered at 43 sampling sites distributed along a salinity gradient in the four harbours. One-fourth of all crustacean species recorded were alien and represented on average 30 % of the total macrocrustacean abundance and 65 % of the total macrocrustacean biomass. The large share of alien crustaceans in the total macrocrustacean biomass was mainly due to several large alien crab species. Most alien species were found in the oligohaline zone, whereas the number of indigenous species slightly increased with increasing salinity. The low number of indigenous species present at low salinities was probably not only caused by salinity, but also by the lower water quality in this salinity range. Based on the site-specific biocontamination index (SBCI), which was used to assess the ecological water quality, the harbour of Nieuwpoort and Ostend scored best and were classified as good, indicating the limited abundance and the low number of alien macrocrustaceans. Sampling locations situated more inland generally had a higher SBCI and a lower ecological water quality. Zeebrugge and Blankenberge were characterised by a severe biocontamination. For Zeebrugge, this is probably related to the intensive transcontinental commercial ship traffic, whereas for Blankenberge, this could be due to introduction of alien species via <b>recreational</b> <b>crafts</b> or due to its geographical location in the proximity of Zeebrugge. Consistent monitoring of estuarine regions and harbours, which are seen as hotspots for introductions, could help in understanding and predicting the impact of alien species on native biota...|$|R

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{investigation of}} <b>recreational</b> small <b>craft</b> characteristics, during the design process, should include also stability assessment of boats underway at high speed. To this aim, {{in order to}} gain insight about the transverse dynamic stability of planing boats, a methodology has been considered and implemented, following the approach proposed by Lewandowsky. An application is performed to Series 62 boats and the successive derived hulls tested at Delft University. Two different deadrise values and some other parameters like loading coefficient, longitudinal position of centre of gravity LCG and length on beam ratio are considered in the analysis, with the aim to ascertain the sensitivity of the method and to investigate a wide range of cases. Calculation are performed with and without appendages. Results are presented in terms of the maximum non dimensional KG in relation with volume Froude number. Successively, the ISO 12217 stability standards are applied to the investigated cases: besides the zero speed condition, some artificial static conditions are modelled by imposition of proper draft and trim, as identified at different speeds. The max KG curve derived from the basic zero speed criteria, i. e. positive GMT, is also calculated. The resultant maximum KG curves are compared with the values found out during the dynamic investigation, allowing to get an insight in a safety rule perspective...|$|R
