5|$|Khrushchev {{was born}} on 15 April 1894, in Kalinovka, a village {{in what is now}} Russia's Kursk Oblast, near the present Ukrainian border. His parents, Sergei Khrushchev and Ksenia Khrushcheva, were poor peasants of Russian origin, and had a {{daughter}} two years Nikita's junior, Irina. Sergei Khrushchev was employed in a number of positions in the Donbas area of far eastern Ukraine, working as a <b>railwayman,</b> as a miner, and laboring in a brick factory. Wages were much higher in the Donbas than in the Kursk region, and Sergei Khrushchev generally left his family in Kalinovka, returning there when he had enough money.|$|E
5|$|In 1868 and 1869, judgements {{went against}} the Met {{in a number of}} hearings, finding {{financial}} irregularities such as the company paying a dividend it could not afford and expenses being paid out of the capital account. In 1870, its directors were found guilty of a breach of trust and ordered to compensate the company. Although they all appealed and were allowed in 1874 to settle for a much lower amount, to restore shareholders' confidence the directors had all been replaced by October 1872 and Edward Watkin appointed chairman. Watkin was an experienced <b>railwayman</b> and already on the board of several railway companies, including the South Eastern Railway (SER), and had an aspiration to construct a line from the north through London to that railway.|$|E
5|$|The Committee set itself several {{rules and}} over the years {{developed}} many practices. The names had to be euphonious (they had to have a pleasant sound). Also, their meaning had to be readily apparent to anyone interested, whether <b>railwayman</b> or member of the public. There had to be good publicity value in the names as well as providing good morale for the staff, and the collection of names for a class had to provide some form of class identity. Another rule was not to use names of people who were still alive at the time, and some on the Committee had a strong dislike of names or associations with the military (largely because they were fed-up with the recently ended war). There was a preference for names of heroes and other well-known people. However, slavishly following a single theme to an absurd extent was discouraged.|$|E

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{has been}} made of the emotional stability of coal-miners with that of <b>railwaymen.</b> Sixty-seven miners and 50 <b>railwaymen</b> were given a small battery of objective tests of emotional instability. A clinical group of 17 psychiatric patients diagnosed as emotionally unstable was also tested. Tests of significance were carried out comparing the scores of the miners with those of the <b>railwaymen</b> and the <b>railwaymen</b> with the clinical group. In addition a factor analysis was made of the scores of the miners. A comparison of the miners and <b>railwaymen</b> on Heron's test of emotional instability revealed a significant difference, the miners scoring more emotionally unstable scores than the <b>railwaymen.</b> The remaining tests, with the exception of those for fluency and hand persistence, failed to dis-criminate between these two groups. Heron's test (both parts) was also the only one to reveal significant differences between the clinical group and the <b>railwaymen.</b> These were in the expected direction. The results on Heron's test suggest that miners are less stable than railway workers and this is attributed to the environmental stresses of mining. It is suggested that many tests purporting t...|$|R

25|$|Ivan Chernyakhovsky {{was born}} in 1906. His father was a <b>railwayman</b> who died of typhus when his son was nine. He was a railway worker until joining the Red Army in 1924.

2500|$|On 14 June 1941 <b>railwayman</b> George Dow {{proposed}} {{in an article}} in the London evening newspaper The Star that new routes, in tunnel, be built from Marylebone south to Victoria, and from King's Cross south to Charing Cross. [...] Both were to connect with a Paddington–Liverpool Street tunnel that he proposed, anticipating Crossrail by 40years. He also proposed a north-east/south- west route from Liverpool Street to Charing Cross, [...] all designed to give London a comprehensive main-line network of connections.|$|E
2500|$|Bill Bowes {{was born}} in Elland on 25 July 1908. His father, John Bowes, was a <b>railwayman</b> whose job with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway caused the family to {{relocate}} often. In 1914, they settled in Armley, Leeds, after he became a goods superintendent there. In his 1949 autobiography, Express Deliveries, Bowes says that he never had any boyhood aspiration to become a professional cricketer, rather he [...] "just slipped into the game". He played street cricket with other boys and he began watching the local Armley club, whose ground was near his home. He particularly admired an Armley pace bowler called Tommy Drake and decided to copy his action so that, throughout {{his career as a}} top-class bowler, his delivery was always [...] "as near Tommy Drake's as possible". Bowes went on to represent his two schools, Armley Park Council School and West Leeds High School, at cricket. At the latter, he gained his school cap after taking a hat trick.|$|E

2500|$|The railway's huge {{deficit and}} the {{reputation}} earned during the Modernisation Plan fiasco for bad financial planning led {{the government to}} take firm action. [...] In 1962, the transport minister Ernest Marples appointed Richard Beeching as head of British Railways with a brief to cut the spiralling losses. Beeching was a businessman rather than a <b>railwayman</b> and his high salary (particularly in a nationalised industry) caused controversy. His report The Reshaping of British Railways (commonly known simply as [...] "The Beeching Report") issued in 1963, concluded {{that much of the}} railway network carried little traffic and should be closed down. His report proposed a massive closures programme which would involve 5,000 miles of track, and 2,363 small stations being closed, which {{came to be known as}} the Beeching axe. The report also proposed that British Rail electrify some major main lines and adopt containerized freight traffic instead of outdated and uneconomic wagon-load traffic.|$|E
2500|$|Once on the ground, the SAS Squadron {{set about}} {{preventing}} German reinforcements reaching Normandy. They attacked the rail network, laid mines, conducted vehicle patrols in their Jeeps and trained {{members of the}} French Resistance. On 10 June a French <b>railwayman</b> informed Tonkin that a train composed of at least eleven petrol tankers was parked at the rail sidings at Châtellerault. These were the fuel reserves for the advancing 2nd SS Panzer Division. To confirm their location, Tonkin sent Lieutenant Tomos Stephens on a reconnaissance of the area. Travelling alone by bicycle, Stephens made the [...] round trip - returning on 11 June. He confirmed {{the location of the}} petrol train. He also reported that it was too heavily guarded for the SAS squadron to deal with. Tonkin contacted England and requested an air attack on the train. That night a force of 12 Royal Air Force de Havilland Mosquito bombers, six each from No. 138 Wing RAF, based at RAF Lasham and 140 Wing, based at Gravesend in Kent, attacked the train in its sidings. The mission was a success.|$|E

60|$|It is a trite observation, and one which, {{young as}} you are, I {{have no doubt}} you have often heard repeated, that we have fallen upon strange times, and live in days of {{constant}} shiftings and changes. I had a melancholy instance of this only {{a week or two}} since. I was returning from Manchester to London by the Mail Train, when I suddenly fell into another train--a mixed train--of reflection, occasioned by the dejected and disconsolate demeanour of the Post- Office Guard. We were stopping at some station where they take in water, when he dismounted slowly from the little box in which he sits in ghastly mockery of his old condition with pistol and blunderbuss beside him, ready to shoot the first highwayman (or <b>railwayman)</b> who shall attempt to stop the horses, which now travel (when they travel at all) INSIDE and in a portable stable invented for the purpose,--he dismounted, I say, slowly and sadly, from his post, and looking mournfully about him as if in dismal recollection of the old roadside public-house the blazing fire--the glass of foaming ale--the buxom handmaid and admiring hangers-on of tap-room and stable, all honoured by his notice; and, retiring a little apart, stood leaning against a signal-post, surveying the engine with a look of combined affliction and disgust which no words can describe. His scarlet coat and golden lace were tarnished with ignoble smoke; flakes of soot had fallen on his bright green shawl- -his pride in days of yore--the steam condensed in the tunnel from which we had just emerged, shone upon his hat like rain. His eye betokened that he was thinking of the coachman; and as it wandered to his own seat and his own fast-fading garb, it was plain to see that he felt his office and himself had alike no business there, and were nothing but an elaborate practical joke.|$|E
