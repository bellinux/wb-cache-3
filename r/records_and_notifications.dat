40|$|Currently, IP {{networks}} are constantly harmed by several attack {{techniques such as}} port scans, denial of service, brute force attacks, etc., which can collapse the continuity of business services. To address this problem, this paper focuses on an alternative solution for detection, block, and prevention of port scanning attacks. Particularly, this implementation is an alternative engine to automatically block specialized tool scans, namely PSAD (Port Scan Attack Detector), but it is conceptualized differently from the features that the program offers. To carry out this work, we have designed and implemented a virtual network environment {{that is to be}} configured as an experimenting platform with port scan attacks. To neutralize such attacks, we performed a security mechanism that takes the data reported by the PSAD and using parameterized variables (block time and level of category) automatic locks become viable, including custom <b>records</b> <b>and</b> <b>notifications</b> via e-mail. To validate our solution, several tests of port scan attacks have been run on public and private networks. Then we have compared the performance of our alternative engine with ClearOS (specialized security tool for Linux) and the PSAD. The results show that our alternative engine is faster and more reliable than the tools previously mentioned. Keywords: Network attacks, port scan attack, security, virtual network environments. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{reviewed}} retrospectively all invasive Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) {{infections in}} adults ascertained from reference laboratory <b>records</b> <b>and</b> <b>notifications</b> from five NHS regions over the 5 years from 1 October 1990, a period encompassing {{the introduction of}} routine Hib childhood immunization (October 1992). A total of 446 cases were identified, a rate of 0. 73 infections per 10 (5) adults per annum. Though numbers of Hib infections in adults fell after the introduction of Hib vaccines for children (P = 0. 035), {{and there was no}} increase in infections caused by other capsulated Hi serotypes, total numbers of invasive Hi infections increased due to a large rise in infections caused by non-capsulated Hi (ncHi) strains (P = 0. 0067). There was an unexpectedly low rate of infections in those aged 75 years or more (P < 0. 0001). The commonest clinical presentations were pneumonia with bacteraemia (227 / 350, 65 %) and bacteraemia alone (62 / 350, 18 %) and the highest rates of disease were in the 65 - 74 years age group (P < 0. 0001). Clinical presentation was not influenced by the capsulation status of the invading Hi strain. 103 / 350 cases (29 %) died within 1 month, and 207 / 350 (59 %) within 6 months of their Hi infection. Case fatality rates were high in all age groups. Pre-existing diseases were noted in 220 / 350 cases and were associated with a higher case fatality rate (82 % vs. 21 %, P < 0. 0001). After the introduction of Hib immunization in children, invasive Hib infections in unimmunized adults also declined, but the overall rate of invasive Hi disease in adults increased, with most infections now caused by non-capsulated strains. Physicians and microbiologists {{should be aware of the}} changing epidemiology, the high associated mortality and high risk of underlying disease. Invasive haemophilus infections in adults should be investigated and treated aggressively...|$|E

40|$|Objective : {{to analyze}} the results of Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) in human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) infected patients and the conduct relative to the results in the Reference Center of Londrina-PR. Methods : A retrospective cohort study, whose {{data were collected from}} the register book of TST, the hospital <b>records</b> <b>and</b> <b>notification.</b> Results : From the 220 patients who underwent TST, most of them were male, between 21 and 50 year-old, with 4 to 11 years of schooling, and 188 completed the tests. Nine of them (4. 8 %) were reactive to TST. Six cases were indicated for treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), only one completed the scheme. It was found that 33 (17. 6 %) patients had negative TST and CD 4 + counting below 200 cells/mm³, however, most did not performed the test after immune reconstitution.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{describe}} the epidemiologic features of meningitis in Al-Ain Medical District, United Arab Emirates from January 2000 through June 2005. MethodsA retrospective review of clinical <b>records</b> <b>and</b> <b>notification</b> forms for cases of meningitis {{reported to the}} Department of Preventive Medicine, Al-Ain. Data collected and compiled included demographic features, causative microbiologic agents, and annual incidence rates of meningitis, by etiology. ResultsNinety-two cases of meningitis were reported during the study period; 53 % were bacterial and 37 % were viral in origin. Neisseria meningitidis was the leading bacterial pathogen (35 %) followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (16 %). Ten percent of clinically diagnosed cases of meningitis had no causative microorganism recovered, and in 33 % of patients with presumed pyogenic meningitis no specific bacterial pathogen could be identified. The peak occurrence of meningitis was in young children {{less than one year}} old. Most cases of meningococcal meningitis were seen among prison inmates and laborers, while viral meningitis occurred mainly in children and young adults attending school. The incidence rate of meningitis in Al-Ain ranged between 2. 2 / 100 000 population in 2000 and 1 / 100 000 in 2005, with an overall downward trend by year. The incidence of Haemophilus influenzae type b decreased significantly after implementation of the national immunization program in 1999. ConclusionsImproved methods of bacterial detection including isolate serotyping must be made available in order to further reduce mortality and morbidity from meningitis...|$|R

40|$|Although {{figures of}} Occupational Accidents are {{published}} annually in many countries, reliable data {{is available only}} in {{a limited number of}} countries (Takala, 1999). Also figures of occupational accidents in most developing countries are not based on proper accident <b>recording</b> <b>and</b> <b>notification</b> systems <b>and</b> under these circumstances, underreporting of occupational accidents is a common problem in many countries (Takala, 1999). When legal frameworks in countries are considered, {{it can be seen that}} some occupations are not covered by the law. Many researches have been done to reveal the extent of underreporting, factors that lead for underreporting and the coverage of occupations by occupational safety legislation in various countries. This study is focused to find the effectiveness of accident reporting system in Sri Lanka, to study the coverage of occupations by the current law and to propose strategies for improving the accident reporting system. Data for the research were of both primary type and secondary type where secondary data were extracted from the records available at the office of the commissioner for workmen’s compensation and primary data were obtained through expert interviews. Accidents reported to the commissioner for workmen’s compensation during one year period were compared with the accidents reported to department of labour during the same period for estimating the rate of underreporting. Also, the identification of economic activities that are not covered by the current legislation with regard to occupational safety and health could be identified through the data obtained from the office of the commissioner for workmen’s compensation. Proposals for enhancing accident reporting were obtained through interviewing experts in the occupational safety and health field. Results of the research show that 27 % of the compensatory accidents are from economic activities that are not covered by OSH legislation and rate of underreporting is 62. 50 %. These indicate that the legal framework should be changed to cover all economic activities and strategies should be implemented to enhance accident reportin...|$|R
40|$|The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a Retrovirus RNA {{of simple}} filament, {{responsible}} for the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).

40|$|Presented at the 14 th International Conference on Auditory Display (ICAD 2008) on June 24 - 27, 2008 in Paris, France. From alarm {{signals and}} data {{sonification}} to multimodal interfaces, auditory displays are omnipresent in our {{everyday life and}} they {{become more and more}} popular. But there are some challenges we have to meet because of the differentness of the auditory sense compared to the visual sense. Usually, audio notification signals are limited to simple warning cues and system feedback that are in most cases intrusive be- cause they differ from the environmental noise. That has the effect that people present in the room could be distracted from their current tasks because they cannot ``close their ears. '' To prevent the disturbing effect of traditional notification signals we developed the novel concept of non-speech audio notification embedded in ambient soundscapes to provide multi-user notification in a more discreet and non-disturbing way. Instead of using well-known non-speech cues like auditory icons and earcons, we decided to compose <b>and</b> <b>record</b> peripheral soundscapes <b>and</b> <b>notification</b> instruments by ourselves towards a more aesthetic approach. In this paper, we give an overview of our location-aware system with two applications (PAAN, AeMN) and sketch a real life scenario in a wine department of a supermarket.
