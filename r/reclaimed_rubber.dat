The reason for this is the growing concern about the effect of rubber product waste on the environment and the rise in the costs of virgin rubbers. In this study, physicomechanical properties such as tensile properties, tear strength, hardness, resilience, abrasion resistance, ageing performance, and swelling behaviour as well as carbon black dispersion rating of 85 / 15 virgin NRinovel reclaimed ground rubber tyre (GRT) revulcanisates were evaluated and compared with those of control vulcanisates.

40|$|Ground {{rubber tyre}} (GRT) {{produced}} by recycling of tyre waste or rejects {{is used as}} a filler in the manufacture of tyre components, mainly to reduce the cost. Rubber matrix-GRT compositions generally exhibit poor mechanical properties due to poor matrix-filler adhesion and lack of reactive sites on GRT particle surfaces. Therefore, GRT is modified by employing various types of reclamation processes to enhance mechanical properties. The modified GRT known as <b>reclaimed</b> <b>rubber</b> is widely used as a component in rubber blends in many applications, especially in tyre manufacturing. This study is focused on developing a cost effective, environmental friendly mechano-chemical reclamation process for GRT to produce reclaim rubber using a readily available amino compound. Initially, influence of the amino compound on rubber compound properties was evaluated and results indicate that it acts as an activator for sulphur vulcanization. Properties of GRT modified with the amino compound indicate that the amino compound acts as a reclaiming agent as well. Comparison of properties of natural rubber (NR) / novel <b>reclaimed</b> <b>rubber</b> blend compounds and revulcanisates with those of the controls reveal that the former can be used as alternatives to the latter in the manufacture of tyre treads. Replacement of 30 % of virgin NR in the vulcanisates with the novel <b>reclaimed</b> <b>rubber</b> retains about 65 - 85 % of strength properties, elongation at break and resilience.

Raw material costs, diminishing natural resources, and the growing awareness of environmental issues and sustainability have made rubber recycling a major area of concern. <b>Reclaiming</b> and recycling <b>rubber</b> waste is a major scientific and technological challenge facing rubber scientists today. This paper reviews {{a number of important}} areas related to the reclaiming, characterizing, testing and recycling of rubber waste. These include: chemical and microbial devulcanization with particular emphasis on main chain scission and kinetics of chemical devulcanization reactions; the cutting-edge techniques for <b>reclaiming</b> devulcanized <b>rubber</b> waste by the action of large shearing forces, heat and chemical agents: and analytical techniques and methods for characterizing composition and testing of devulcanized rubber waste, respectively. In addition, some aspects of the recycling of devulcanized ethylene-propylene-diene rubber (EPDM) waste will be reported. EPDM is used extensively in automotive components world-wide and recycling the rubber {{at the end of its}} useful service life is of major importance to manufacturers of automotive components...|$|R
