40|$|A paste {{thickener}} produces underflow with a {{high solids}} concentration by removing water from a dilute suspension. Paste thickening technology has been gradually gaining acceptance in the mining industry. Some of the main challenges in thickening are the complex dynamics due to severe interactions between operating parameters {{and the existence of}} a large range of process time constants. Additionally, being a downstream process, paste thickeners suffer from fluctuating feed conditions from upstream processes. Furthermore, the operation of paste thickeners involves a tight operating window as the underflow properties are sensitive to small changes in concentration. The above challenges motivate this work to develop a systematic advanced control strategy, in particular, model predictive control (MPC) to effectively and efficiently regulate this complex, multivariable process. In this thesis, the sedimentation-consolidation model is adopted and analysed to identify important dynamical features and the key process parameter which will be considered in control system design. The model is then validated using industrial plant data. An extended Kalman filter is developed to estimate in real-time the key process parameter which affects thickening dynamics significantly. Through extensive simulation studies, it has been demonstrated that the proposed MPC approach can deliver a higher underflow solids concentration and a better regulated underflow removal rate. In addition to the basic MPC, several important extensions are developed based on three practical considerations. Firstly, it is illustrated that incorporating ``future'' time-varying constraints in the MPC can help deal with the control difficulty arising from the co-disposal of underflow and coarse reject, leading to improved control performance. Secondly, an MPC with a non-uniformly spaced optimisation horizon is proposed to deal with the timescale multiplicity of thickening. The proposed approach provides similar levels of performance as compared to a conventional MPC with the advantage of reduced computational complexity. A stability ensuring condition for the proposed MPC is also developed. Thirdly, an MPC is developed to control both underflow solids concentration and <b>rake</b> <b>torque.</b> The nonlinear <b>rake</b> <b>torque</b> control problem is converted into a linear MPC problem, reducing the computational complexity of the optimisation problem. Simulation {{studies have shown that the}} proposed approach can effectively control the underflow solids concentration while minimising the <b>rake</b> <b>torque,</b> potentially preventing serious operational problems such as underflow blockage...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} {{model for a}} general clarifier-thickener has been made and used for comparing different strategies for control of such dewatering units through simulations. The model builds on widely acknowledged theory for modelling clarifier-thickeners - discretizing the settling PDE into a set of ODEs so that concentrations of solids at discrete depths inside the unit become {{the states of the}} numerical model - and it was written in the Modelica language using the modelling and simulation environment Dymola. The work of estimating model parameters for themodel and comparing different control strategies was made looking at one particular clarifier-thickener at the company Boliden's mineral processing plant in Garpenberg. Among the control strategies that were compared in simulations were simple PID control and cascade control as well as more advanced control schemes. The simulations showed that the optimal control strategy to use is cascade control using <b>rake</b> <b>torque</b> as a secondary variable, which makes sense in particular for large thickeners such as the one mainly considered in this work...|$|E
