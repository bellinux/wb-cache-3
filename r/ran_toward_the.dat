5|$|On {{the morning}} of 10 July, former Prime Minister Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain and Federal Religious Affairs Minister Muhammad Ijaz-ul-Haq {{declared}} that peace negotiations via loudspeaker and mobile phone had failed. Within minutes, the Special Service Group were issued orders to storm the mosque. Pakistan Army spokesman Waheed Arshad said troops began by attacking and breaching the mosque {{from the south and}} assaulted it from three directions at 4:00am (23:00 GMT). The forces immediately came under gunfire from heavily armed militants hunkered down behind sandbagged positions on the roof and from holes in the walls of the mosque. The SSG quickly cleared the mosque's ground floor, amid explosions coming from the mosque. About 30 women and children <b>ran</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> advancing SSG operators and managed to escape unharmed.|$|E
25|$|On March 15, Herrera’s platoon was {{advancing}} along {{a wooded}} road near the French town of Mertzwiller when it ran into two German machine-gun emplace-ments. Caught in a deadly crossfire {{between the two}} guns, the GIs dived for cover. Fearing that his comrades would be cut to pieces, Herrera stood up and <b>ran</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> closest enemy position, firing his rifle from the hip. He tossed two grenades at the machine-gun nest; the concussion knocked the Germans down. Then he was on them, and all eight soldiers threw down their weapons and surrendered to him.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half of the game, Chinese forward Li Yi {{deliberately}} kicked Lee's right shin after Lee completed a pass. Having recovered from a recent ankle injury, Lee was upset at Li's foul play and slapped Li on the back of his head, thereafter which Li Yi started to roll on the ground grabbing his head. For a while the entire Chinese and Korean squad <b>ran</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> scene resulting in brief ruckus and some degree of physical contact but further conflict did not occur, as the referee awarded a yellow card for Li (simulation) and a red card for Lee (violence).|$|E

50|$|In normal play, if {{the ball}} is hit into the infield, one of <b>the</b> players will <b>run</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> ball while another <b>runs</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> base {{that is no longer}} covered. For instance, if {{the ball is}} hit <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> second baseman, he will <b>run</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> ball while <b>the</b> shortstop <b>runs</b> <b>toward</b> second base. This allows the fielding player to throw the ball to the player on the base to attempt a put out. However, during a stolen base attempt the normal {{gameplay}} and positioning is altered. In the typical case, a baserunner on first base will start running <b>toward</b> second, causing <b>the</b> infielders to move toward that base in order to tag the runner when the ball is thrown to them from the pitcher or catcher. This reaction places the infielders out of position for a hit ball, with gaps opening at midway points between first and second and second and third.|$|R
25|$|On April 30, 1598, the northward-bound Spanish conquistadors crossed large {{sand dunes}} about 27 {{miles south of}} present-day {{downtown}} El Paso. It is said that the expeditionaries and their horses <b>ran</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> river, and two horses drank themselves to death. Don Juan de Oñate, a New Spain-born conquistador of Spanish parents, was an expedition leader who ordered a big feast north of the Río Grande {{in what is now}} San Elizario. This was the first documented and true Thanksgiving in North America. Oñate declared La Toma (taking possession), claiming all territory north of the Río Grande for King Philip II of Spain.|$|E
25|$|The attack {{began at}} around 10:30A.M. when six gunmen, wearing {{explosive}} belts entered the school {{from the back}} through a cemetery adjacent to the school after having scaled the walls. Army Public School is located at Warsak Road near the Peshawar Cantt, and is part of Army Public Schools and College Systems that runs 146 schools in Pakistan. Before entering the school, the gunmen {{set fire to the}} Suzuki Bolan ST41 van in which they had arrived. The terrorists, bearing automatic weapons,and grenades, moved straight toward the auditorium located at the centre of the complex and opened fire indiscriminately on the children who were gathered there for First aid training. According to the Director General of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the public relations department of the Pakistani military, Major-General Asim Bajwa, the terrorists did not intend to take any hostages but instead wanted to kill as many pupils as they could. As the terrorists opened fire, many of the pupils <b>ran</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> two exits {{on the other side of}} the auditorium, but many of them were gunned down in the garden.|$|E
25|$|The 1908 pennant {{races in}} both the AL and NL {{were among the most}} {{exciting}} ever witnessed. The conclusion of the National League season, in particular, involved a bizarre chain of events, {{often referred to as the}} Merkle Boner. On September 23, 1908, the New York Giants and Chicago Cubs played a game in the Polo Grounds. Nineteen-year-old rookie first baseman Fred Merkle, later to become one of the best players at his position in the league, was on first base, with teammate Moose McCormick on third with two outs and the game tied. Giants shortstop Al Bridwell socked a single, scoring McCormick and apparently winning the game. However, Merkle, instead of advancing to second base, <b>ran</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> clubhouse to avoid the spectators mobbing the field, which at that time was a common, acceptable practice. The Cubs' second baseman, Johnny Evers, noticed this. In the confusion that followed, Evers claimed to have retrieved the ball and touched second base, forcing Merkle out and nullifying the run scored. Evers brought this to the attention of the umpire that day, Hank O'Day, who after some deliberation called the runner out. Because of the state of the field O'Day thereby called the game. Despite the arguments by the Giants, the league upheld O'Day's decision and ordered the game replayed at the end of the season, if necessary. It turned out that the Cubs and Giants ended the season tied for first place, so the game was indeed replayed, and the Cubs won the game, the pennant, and subsequently the World Series (the last Cubs Series victory until 2016).|$|E

500|$|In 1930, Birkett was {{involved}} in the so-called Blazing Car murder case. On 6 November 1930, two men returning home in Northampton noticed a bright light in the distance and saw a man come out of a ditch {{at the side of the}} road, glance back toward the light and say [...] "looks like somebody has had a bonfire". The two young men <b>ran</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> light, saw it was a burning car and fetched a policeman. When the fires died away, a body was found inside the boot of a car with a face so charred it was impossible to determine the identity of the man; the numberplate of the car was intact, however, and traced to an Alfred Arthur Rouse. Rouse was arrested and appeared at Northampton Crown Court on 26 January 1931, charged with the murder of an unknown man. He was defended by Donald Finnemore, and the Crown was represented by Birkett and Richard Elwes. Rouse was damned by a series of events. When arrested, he made statements such as [...] "I'm very glad it's over" [...] and [...] "I'm responsible" [...] and that the car engine had been off at the time of the fire, ruling out the possibility of accidental ignition. When he appeared as a witness, the defendant claimed that after giving an unknown man a lift, he had found that he was running out of petrol and had asked the passenger to take the spare can in the car and fill up the fuel tank. While he was doing this, Rouse testified that he went to the side of the road to urinate, and while there heard a large explosion. He said he saw a large flame and became convinced the petrol tank would explode. As such he ran away as fast as possible, at which point he ran into the two young men on the road.|$|E
2500|$|For {{its sixth}} game, Michigan {{traveled}} to Bloomington, Indiana, {{to play the}} Indiana Hoosiers. [...] Michigan won, 7–0, on a touchdown run and PAT by Harry Newman. [...] After returning a punt to the Indiana 48-yard line, Newman dropped back on a fake pass play and then ran for a 34-yard gain. [...] With a first down inside the Indiana one-yard line, fullback Ted Petoskey was stopped on first and second downs. [...] On third down, Newman <b>ran</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> sideline and into the endzone for the game's only score. [...] On defense, the Wolverines held Indiana to 97 yards of total offense (77 rushing and 20 passing) and intercepted five of Indiana's 13 pass attempts.|$|E
2500|$|In 1830, {{a series}} of {{meetings}} were held in Lenzberg to discuss changing the cantonal constitution. [...] When peaceful negotiation with the cantonal authorities in Aarau failed to produce results, Johann Heinrich Fischer from Merenschwand called for a rebel militia from the Freiämter to force the government to change, in what was known as the Freiämtersturm. [...] On 6 December 1830, his rebel troops marched toward Lenzberg on their way to Aarau. [...] At Lenzberg, about 100 government soldiers formed to resist the militia, and brought their guns in position. [...] The Freiämter milita <b>ran</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> militia with wild battle cries, and the government soldiers broke and ran without firing a shot. [...] By 6pm the militia entered Aarau and the commander of government troops surrendered without any resistance.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} UCSB's 2-1 loss to UC Davis in overtime, UCSB coach Tim Vom Steeg was aggressively [...] {{yelling at}} the referees for what he {{believed}} was a missed foul call preceding the UC Davis golden goal. [...] During the chaos, UCSB senior Peter McGlynn <b>ran</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> match referee, Reed Christy, and pushed {{him to the ground}} despite Vom Steeg's attempts to block McGlynn. [...] McGlynn was detained by campus police and later released. [...] As a result of the incident, the UCSB Athletics Department, in collaboration with the Big West Conference, removed McGlynn from the team with two games remaining in his senior year, suspended head coach Tim Vom Steeg for the following game, and chose to forgo postseason play for 2012. [...] McGlynn later apologized with a statement on his Twitter account and pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor and served community service as a result.|$|E
2500|$|Wong {{descended from}} the rooftop to the street, where he got {{into his car and}} drove quickly toward the ruined railway station. When he arrived, he noted carnage and confusion: [...] "It was a horrible sight. People were still trying to get up. Dead and injured lay strewn across the tracks and platform. Limbs lay all over the place. Only my work helped me forget what I was seeing. I stopped to reload my camera. I noticed that my shoes were soaked with blood. I walked across the railway tracks, and made many long scenes with the burning {{overhead}} bridge in the background. Then I saw a man pick up a baby from the tracks and carry him to the platform. He went back to get another badly injured child. The mother lay dead on the tracks. As I filmed this tragedy, I heard the sound of planes returning. Quickly, I shot my remaining few feet [...] on the baby. I <b>ran</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> child, intending to carry him to safety, but the father returned. The bombers passed overhead. No bombs were dropped." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{approximately}} 2:30a.m. on March 13, 1964, Genovese {{left the}} bar {{she worked at}} and began driving home in her red Fiat. While waiting for a traffic light to change on Hoover Avenue, she was spotted by Winston Moseley, who {{was sitting in his}} parked car. Genovese arrived home around 3:15a.m. and parked her car in the Kew Gardens Station Long Island Rail Road parking lot, about [...] from her apartment's door, in an alleyway {{at the rear of the}} building. As she walked toward the apartment complex, Moseley, [...] who had followed her home, exited his vehicle, which he had parked at a corner bus stop on Austin Street, and approached Genovese armed with a hunting knife. Genovese <b>ran</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> front of the building, and Moseley ran after her, overtook her and stabbed her twice in the back. Genovese screamed, [...] "Oh my God, he stabbed me! Help me!". Several neighbors heard her cry, but only a few of them recognized the sound as a cry for help. When Robert Mozer, one of the neighbors, shouted at the attacker [...] "Let that girl alone!", Moseley ran away and Genovese slowly made her way toward the rear entrance of the building, seriously injured and out of view of any witnesses.|$|E
