40|$|Background: Recently the {{exercises}} and fitness professionals have adopted water {{as an alternative}} medium for delivering programs to improve fitness and health. When exercise on dry land our skeletal muscular, cardiovascular, respiratory and other body systems are greatly affected {{by the forces of}} gravity. When exercise in water, the effects created by the gravitational pull on the body are attenuated. Therefore the aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effectiveness of land based endurance training and aquatic based endurance training for enhancing endurance in normal individuals. Methods: An experimental study design with 30 subjects healthy individuals between 20 - 30 years of both sexes currently were divided equally into 2 groups. Group A underwent land based exercises while Group B underwent aquatic based exercises. The outcome measures consist of RPP (rate pressure product), <b>REC</b> HR (<b>recovery</b> heart rate), RHR (resting heart rate) and 6 MWD (6 minute walking distance) was measured before (pre-training) and after four weeks of endurance training. Results: In this study, the mean improvement between the 2 groups of land and aquatic based endurance exercises were tested for significance using a dependent t test. The calculated t value were 43. 550, 4. 583, 16, 5. 870 for RPP, REC HR, RHR, 6 MWD for group A respectively. For group B 25. 922, 12. 762, 27. 495, 19. 236 for RPP, REC HR, RHR, 6 MWD for group A respectively with p< 0. 05. This clearly indicated that both land based exercises and aquatic based exercises will improve cardiovascular endurance significantly and there is no significant difference between land based exercises and aquatic based exercises for enhancing endurance in normal individuals. Conclusion: It is concluded that both land based and aquatic based endurance exercises methods produce equivalent, if not same effect on the enhancement of aerobic endurance. There was no significant difference between these two exercising mediums. Nonetheless, given the benefits of aquatic medium, aquatic based endurance exercises should be considered as an alternative for land based training...|$|R

Exercise was accompanied by tachicardia, hypertension and skin vasoconstriction. Spectral analysis revealed an activation of the low frequency (LF, ~ 0. 1 Hz) in RR and SAP during EXE 2 and EXE 3. Recovery reestablished basal conditions in this regard. Vasomotor activity appeared as a LF component in G shifted at a lower frequency (~ 0. 7 Hz at R). At R SAP and DAP appeared pulled toward the vasomotor frequency compared to RR and this frequency change appeared to be enhanced by exercise. Conversely, during REC and uncoupling between systemic LF and vasomotor waves appeared.

(cv Chardonnay) by studying effects of AQP inhibitors, and AQP gene expression during water stress (WS) and <b>recovery</b> (<b>REC).</b> Kleaf was measured after 3 h of petiole perfusion with different solutions and to introduce inhibitors. The addition of 0. 1 mm HgCl 2 to 15 mm KCl reduced Kleaf compared with perfusion in 15 mM KNO 3 or KCl, and these solutions were used for leaves from control, WS and REC plants. Perfusion for 3 h did not significantly alter stomatal conductance (gs) though expression of VvTIP 1; 1 was increased. WS decreased Kleaf by about 30 % and was correlated with gs. The expression of VvTIP 2; 1 and VvPIP 2; 1 correlated with Kleaf, and VvTIP 2; 1 was highly correlated with gs. There was no association between the expression of particular AQPs during WS and REC and inhibition of Kleaf by HgCl 2; however, HgCl 2 treatment itself increased expression of VvPIP 2; 3 and decreased expression of VvPIP 2; 1. Inhibition by HgCl 2 of Kleaf only at early stages of WS and then after REC suggested that apoplasmic pathways become more important during WS.

Fasted blood samples were collected before and after exercise, on day 7 of each training week and were analyzed for plasma BDNF and cortisol concentrations. A 24 -item Profile Of Mood State questionnaire was administered on day 7 of each training week and global mood score (GMS) was calculated. Results Time trial performance was impaired during INT (p= 0. 01) and REC (p= 0. 02) compared with NT. Basal plasma cortisol (NT= 153 ± 16 ng/ml, INT= 130 ± 11 ng/ml, REC= 150 ± 14 ng/ml) and BDNF (NT= 484 ± 122 pg/ml, INT= 488 ± 122 pg/ml, REC= 383 ± 56 pg/ml) concentrations were similar between training conditions.

Methods and Findings: After 2 baseline nights of 8 hours time in bed (TIB), 13 healthy young men had only 4 hours TIB per night for 5 nights, followed by 2 recovery nights with 8 hours TIB. 6 control subjects had 8 hours TIB per night throughout the experiment. Heart rate, blood pressure, salivary cortisol and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured after the baseline (BL), sleep restriction (SR) and <b>recovery</b> (<b>REC)</b> period. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected at these time points, counted and stimulated with PHA.

While hypoxia is of importance physiologically and clinically, lacunae exist in {{our knowledge of the}} systemic and temporal changes in gene expression occurring in blood during the exposure and recovery from hypoxia. To identify these changes expression profiling was conducted on blood obtained from cohorts of C 57 Bl- 10 wild type mice that were maintained at normoxia (NX), exposed for two weeks to normobaric chronic hypoxia (CH) or two weeks of CH followed by two weeks of normoxic <b>recovery</b> (<b>REC).</b> Using stringent bioinformatic cut-offs (0 % FDR, 2 fold change cut-off), 230 genes were identified and separated into four distinct temporal categories. Class I) contained 1 transcript up-regulated in both CH and REC; Class II) contained 202 transcripts up-regulated in CH but down-regulated after REC; Class III) contained 9 transcripts down-regulated both in CH and REC; Class IV) contained 18 transcripts down-regulated after CH exposure but up-regulated after REC. Profiling was independently validated and extended by analyzing expression levels of selected genes as novel biomarkers from our profile (e. g. spectrin alpha- 1, ubiquitin domain family- 1 and pyrroline- 5 -carboxylate reductase- 1) by performing qPCR at 7 different time points during CH and REC.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that ultraendurance exercise influences muscle mitochondrial function has been investigated. Athletes in ultraendurance performance performed running, kayaking, and cycling at 60 % of their peak O(2) consumption for 24 h. Muscle biopsies were taken preexercise (Pre-Ex), postexercise (Post-Ex), and after 28 h of <b>recovery</b> (<b>Rec).</b> Respiration was analyzed in isolated mitochondria during state 3 (coupled to ATP synthesis) and state 4 (noncoupled respiration), with fatty acids alone [palmitoyl carnitine (PC) ] or together with pyruvate (Pyr). Electron transport chain activity {{was measured with}} NADH in permeabilized mitochondria. State 3 respiration with PC increased Post-Ex by 39 and 41 % (P 0. 05). State 4 respiration with PC increased Post-Ex but was lower than Pre-Ex at Rec (P < 0. 05 vs. Pre-Ex). Mitochondrial efficiency [amount of added ADP divided by oxygen consumed during state 3 (P/O ratio) ] decreased Post-Ex by 9 and 6 % (P < 0. 05) with PC and PC + Pyr, respectively. P/O ratio remained reduced at Rec. Muscle uncoupling protein 3, measured with Western blotting, was not changed Post-Ex but tended to decrease at Rec (P = 0. 07 vs. Pre-Ex). In conclusion, extreme endurance exercise decreases mitochondrial efficiency. This will increase oxygen demand and may partly explain the observed elevation in whole body oxygen consumption during standardized exercise (+ 13 %). The increased mitochondrial capacity for PC oxidation indicates plasticity in substrate oxidation at the mitochondrial level, which may be of advantage during prolonged exercise.

40|$|Actin and villin {{compartmentation}} during ATP depletion {{and recovery}} in renal cultured cells. ATP-depletion in renal cultured cells {{has been used}} as a model for studying various cytoskeletal and functional alterations induced by renal ischemia. This communication explores the reversibility of these effects utilizing a novel method [1] that depleted ATP (ATP-D) to 2 % of control within 30 minutes and caused complete <b>recovery</b> (<b>REC)</b> of ATP in one hour. Under confocal microscopy, ATP-D (30 min) caused thinning of F-actin from the microvilli, cortical region, and basal stress fibers, with the concurrent appearance of intracellular F-actin patches. These changes were more pronounced after 60 minutes of ATP-D. One hour of REC following 30 minutes of ATP-D produced complete recovery of F-actin in each region of the cell. However, after 60 minutes of ATP-D, a heterogeneous F-actin recovery pattern was observed: almost complete recovery of the apical ring and microvilli, thinned cortical actin with occasional breaks along the basolateral membrane, and a dramatic reduction in basal stress fiber density. The time course of cortical actin and actin ring disruption and recovery coincided with a drop and recovery in the transepithelial resistance and the cytoskeletal dissociation and reassociation of the Na,K-ATPase. Additionally, the microvilli retracted into the cells during ATP-D, a process that was reversed during REC. Triton extraction and confocal microscopy demonstrated that villin remained closely associated with microvillar actin during both ATP-D and REC. These distinctive regional differences in the responses of F-actin to ATP depletion and repletion in cultured renal epithelial cells may help to clarify some of the differential tubular responses to ischemia and reperfusion in the kidney...|$|R

ST trends were visually analyzed by two observers blinded from the thrombolytic treatment, its onset, and coronary angiograms performed 21 hours (median) after thrombolysis. Three basic and consecutive components were considered for analysis: the initial amplitude of ST elevation (A 1), the maximal amplitude <b>recovery</b> (<b>REC),</b> and the minimal ST amplitude (A 2). Prespecified patterns (PAT) were considered: PAT 1 integrated permanent A 1 elevation followed by REC, PAT 2 intermittent A 1 elevation, and REC. Prespecified pattern 3 was considered in absence of REC. Twenty-four-hour trends were recorded in 347 patients and judged adequate in 306 (88 %) followed by angiography in 268 (77 %). This group was not clinically different from the 79 patients without ST/angiography. Prespecified pattern 1 was identified in 81 %, PAT 2 in 8 %, and PAT 3 in 11 % of the patients.

40|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) {{produced}} in skeletal muscle {{may play a}} role in potentiating the beneficial responses to exercise; however, the effects of exercise-induced ROS on insulin action and protein signaling in humans has not been fully elucidated. Seven healthy, recreationally active participants volunteered for this double-blind, randomized, repeated-measures crossover study. Exercise was undertaken with infusion of saline (CON) or the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to attenuate ROS. Participants performed two 1 -h cycling exercise sessions 7 - 14 days apart, 55 min at 65 % VO₂peak plus 5 min at 85 %VO₂peak, followed 3 h later by a 2 -h hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (40 mIU∙min⁻¹∙m²) to determine insulin sensitivity. Four muscle biopsies were taken on each trial day, at baseline before NAC infusion (BASE), after exercise (EX), after 3 -h <b>recovery</b> (<b>REC),</b> and post-insulin clamp (PI). Exercise, ROS, and insulin action on protein phosphorylation were evaluated with immunoblotting. NAC tended to decrease postexercise markers of the ROS/protein carbonylation ratio by - 13. 5 % (P = 0. 08) and increase the GSH/GSSG ratio twofold vs. CON (P < 0. 05). Insulin sensitivity was reduced (- 5. 9 %, P < 0. 05) by NAC compared with CON without decreased phosphorylation of Akt or AS 160. Whereas p-mTOR was not significantly decreased by NAC after EX or REC, phosphorylation of the downstream protein synthesis target kinase p 70 S 6 K was blunted by 48 % at PI with NAC compared with CON (P < 0. 05). We conclude that NAC infusion attenuated muscle ROS and postexercise insulin sensitivity independent of Akt signaling.

In order to clarify if the amount of SWS is crucial in determining SWS recovery, we selectively deprived SWS during two nights to assess the presence of a compensatory SWS rebound in the following recovery night. Ten normal males slept for 6 consecutive nights in the laboratory. After an adaptation and two baseline nights (BSL; BSL-A), selective SWS deprivation was accomplished for two consecutive nights (DEP- 1; DEP- 2), by means of an acoustic stimulation technique. A <b>recovery</b> (<b>REC)</b> night then followed. An almost complete selective SWS suppression during both deprivation nights was achieved. A significant increase of S 4 and SWS in the REC as compared to the BSL-A paralleled a significant shortening of S 3 and S 4 latencies. S 2 percentage significantly increased during both DEP nights with respect to the other experimental nights. There was no significant difference among nights with regard to total sleep time, percentage of REM sleep, stage 1, movement time, number of awakenings and number of movement arousals, indicating that the acoustic stimulation technique did not dramatically disrupt normal sleep continuity and architecture. These results indicate that SWS rebound after selective SWS deprivation can be ascribed to the loss of SWS accumulated during two consecutive nights, further supporting the idea that the delta sleep amount is more linked to SWS in the previous sleep periods than to the total sleep duration...|$|R

The patients presented values of P 50 in vivo during rest (R) higher than the control group (p < 0. 05); the filtration time of blood (FT) and the flow rate of erythrocyte filtration (FR) rose significantly from the R to the precocious <b>recovery</b> (<b>Rec)</b> phase, both in the control group (p < 0. 01) and in the patients (p < 0. 001). There was, therefore, no remarkable difference in these parameters as well as in arterial pH, Hb and Ht at rest and after maximum effort, between the patients and the control group. The lactate presented higher values (p < 0. 05) in the control group when only early phase of Rec was taken into account.

After revascularization, of 248 dysfunctional viable segments 186 (75 %) showed an improvement in LV function. An increase in LV ejection fraction (from 30 +/- 10 % to 42 +/- 11 %, p < 0. 01) and a decrease in end-diastolic volume (from 207 +/- 74 ml to 174 +/- 74 ml, p < 0. 01) were observed after revascularization. Overall concordance between the VIA map and the REC map was 85 %, with a k value of 0. 63. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the VIA map for predicting functional recovery were 89 %, 75 %, 91 % and 71 %, respectively. The proposed polar map of myocardial viability obtained by gated SPECT imaging accurately predicts functional recovery after coronary revascularization. Thus, a direct quantitative image of viability obtained from perfusion/function matching may be helpful for clinical decision-making in patients with ischaemic LV dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that circulating atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a marker for cardiac filling pressures and ventricular myocardial production of ANP a marker for ventricular hypertrophy and/or dilatation. To address the role of circulating ANP as a marker for ventricular hypertrophy and dilatation as compared to cardiac filling pressures, we developed a new canine model of pacing induced heart failure that in contrast to previous pacing models produces sustained ventricular hypertrophy. This involves gradually increasing the pacing rate from 180 to 240 bpm over 30 days (PROG PACE, n= 5) followed by 4 weeks of <b>recovery</b> (<b>REC,</b> n= 6). Four NORMAL dogs served as controls. Diastolic dimension (LVEDd) and EF were assessed by echo. LV mass was assessed by echo prior to rapid ventricular pacing (pre-RVP) in the PROG PACE (4. 2 ± 0. 2 g/kg) and REC (4. 7 ± 0. 2 g/kg) dogs. LV mass was assessed at autopsy after PROG PACE and REC and in NORMAL dogs. Ventricular ANP was assessed by sensitive and specific immunohistochemical staining for ANP 1 – 28.

Methods: Trained male cyclists (V˙ O 2 max = 64. 2 T 6. 5 mLIkgj 1 Iminj 1) completed two 3 -wk trials both divided equally into normal (NOR), intensified (INT), and <b>recovery</b> (<b>REC)</b> training. In a counterbalanced crossover experimental design, cyclists received either a high-protein (PRO; 3 g proteinIkgj 1 body mass (BM) Idj 1) or a normal diet (CON; 1. 5 g proteinIkgj 1 BMIdj 1) during INT and REC. Dietary carbohydrate content remained constant at 6 gIkgj 1 BMIdj 1. Energy balance was maintained during each training week. Endurance performance was assessed with aV˙ O 2 max test and a preloaded time trial. Alterations in blood metabolite responses to exercise were measured at rest, during, and after exercise. Cyclists completed the Daily Analysis of Life Demands for Athletes (DALDA) questionnaire each day. Results: Increased dietary protein intake led to a possible attenuation (4. 3 %; 90 % confidence limits !/" 5. 4 %) in the decrement in time trial performance after a block of high-intensity training compared with NOR (PRO = 2639 T 350 s; CON = 2555 T 313 s). Restoration of endurance performance during recovery training possibly benefited (2. 0 %; !/" 4. 9 %) from additional protein intake. Frequency of symptoms of stress described as ‘‘worse than normal’’ reported after a block of high-intensity training was very likely (97 %) attenuated (17; T 11 AUC of ‘‘a’’ scores part B, DALDA for INT + REC) by increasing the protein content of the diet. No discernable changes in blood metabolite concentrations were observed in PRO. Conclusions: Additional protein intake reduced symptoms of psychological stress and may result in a worthwhile amelioration of the performance decline experienced during a block of high-intensity training...|$|R
40|$|Background and objective: Myocardial {{deformation}} {{indices are}} considered as sensitive markers of ischemia {{and may be}} useful in the quantification of hemodynamic significance of coronary artery disease (CAD). We sought to determine the diagnostic value of speckle-tracking echocardiography derived myocardial deformation parameters at rest and during stress to determine hemodynamically significance coronary artery stenosis in patients with moderate and high probability of CAD. Materials and methods: In 81 patients (mean age, 64  ±  8. 6 years) with stable CAD inducible myocardial ischemia was evaluated by dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) and adenosine magnetic resonance imaging (AMRI). Based on AMRI patients were divided into two groups: nonpathologic (n =  41) and pathologic (n =  40). Strain and strain rate (SR) parameters and their changes from the rest (BASE) to low stress (MIN), peak stress (MAX), and <b>recovery</b> (<b>REC)</b> were analyzed using 2 D speckle-tracking imaging (STI). Results: In the nonpathologic group, systolic longitudinal and circumferential strain increased significantly from BASE to MIN, as well as systolic SR from BASE to MIN and from MIN to MAX in longitudinal plane. In contrast, in the pathologic group, insignificant longitudinal systolic SR increase and radial and circumferential systolic SR decrease from MIN to MAX was observed. Discriminant function analysis revealed that select STI derived parameters best classify patients into predefined AMRI groups (pathologic and nonpathologic) with the accuracy respectively 90. 9 % and 83. 3 %. According to ROC analysis these myocardial deformation parameters had the greatest predictive value of significant coronary artery stenoses: longitudinal strain at high dose (AUC 0. 811, sensitivity 89. 4 %, specificity 64. 7 %), longitudinal strain rate at high dose (AUC 0. 855, sensitivity 88. 1 %, specificity 71. 0 % at high doses). The sensitivity and specificity of inducible wall motion abnormalities were 74. 0 % and 85. 0 % (AUC 0. 798) and was lower compared with the diagnostic value of longitudinal myocardial deformation parameters. Conclusions: Left ventricular strain and strain rate analyses during DSE can be used in the assessment of hemodynamic significance of coronary artery stenosis in patients with moderate and high risk for CAD...|$|R
40|$|Traits {{associated}} with cheese yield and milk nutrient recovery in curd {{are used to}} describe the efficiency of the cheese-making process. This is fundamental for all dairy species, including the Italian Mediterranean buffalo, which is largely used for milk production aimed at the dairy industry. To assess cheese-making traits among buffalo, a model cheese-manufacturing process was tested; it was capable of processing 24 samples per run, using 0. 5 -L samples of milk from individual buffalo. In total, 180 buffalo reared in 7 herds located in Northeast Italy were sampled once. Briefly, each sample was weighed and heated (35 degrees C for 30 min), inoculated with starter culture (90 min), and mixed with rennet (51. 2 international milk-clotting units/L of milk). After 10 mm of gelation, the curd was cut; 5 mm after the cut, the curd was separated from the whey, and the curd was subjected to draining (for 30 mm) and pressing (18 h). The curd and whey were weighed, analyzed for pH and the total solid, fat, lactose, and protein contents, and subjected to estimation of the energy content. Three measures of cheese yield (%CY), %CYCURD, %CYSOLIDS and %CYWATER, were computed as the ratios between the weight of the curd, the curd dry matter, and the water retained in the curd, respectively, and the weight of the milk processed. These traits were multiplied by the daily milk yield to define the 3 corresponding measures of daily cheese yield (dCY, kg/d). The milk component <b>recoveries</b> (<b>REC)</b> in the curd, RECFAT, RECPROTEIN, and RECSOLIDS, represented the ratios between the weights of the fat, protein, and total solids in the curd, respectively, and the corresponding components in the milk. Finally, energy recovery (RECENERGY) was estimated. The values for %CYCURD, %GY(SOLIDS), %CYWATER, RECPROTEIN, RECFAT, RECSOLIDS and RECENERGY averaged 25. 6, 12. 7, 12. 9, 80. 4, 95. 1, 66. 7, and 79. 3 %, respectively, indicating that buffalo milk has a higher aptitude to cheese-making than bovine milk. The effect of days in milk was the most important source of variation for %CY, RECPROTEIN, and the overall recoveries (which showed higher values toward the end of lactation), whereas parity did not appear to influence any of the investigated traits. The cheese-making procedure tested allowed us to assess the variability of and relationships among different cheese yield traits, recovery traits, daily milk production traits, and milk components at the individual level...|$|R
40|$|Cheese yield (CY) is {{the most}} {{important}} technological trait of milk, because cheese-making uses a very high proportion of the milk produced worldwide. Few studies have been carried out at the level of individual milk-producing animals due to a scarcity of appropriate procedures for model-cheese production, the complexity of cheese-making, and the frequent use of the fat and protein (or casein) contents of milk as a proxy for cheese yield. Here, we report a high-throughput cheese manufacturing process that mimics all phases of cheese-making, uses 1. 5 -L samples of milk from individual animals, and allows the simultaneous processing of 15 samples per run. Milk samples were heated (35 C for 40 mm), inoculated with starter culture (90 mm), mixed with rennet (51. 2 international milk-clotting units/L of milk), and recorded for gelation time. Curds were cut twice (10 and 15 mm after gelation), separated from the whey, drained (for 30 min), pressed (3 times, 20 mm each, with the wheel turned each time), salted in brine (for 60 mm), weighed, and sampled. Whey was collected, weighed, and sampled. Milk, curd, and whey samples were analyzed for pH, total solids, fat content, and protein content, and energy content was estimated. Three measures of percentage cheese yield (%CY) were calculated: %CYCURD, %CYSOLIDS and %CYWATER) representing the ratios between the weight of fresh curd, the total solids of the curd, and the water content of the curd, respectively, and the weight of the milk processed. In addition, 3 measures of daily cheese yield (dCY, kg/d) were defined, considering the daily milk yield. Three measures of nutrient <b>recovery</b> (<b>REC)</b> were computed: RECFAT, RECPROTEIN, and RECSOLIDS, which represented the ratio between the weights of the fat, protein, and total solids in the curd, respectively, and the corresponding components in the milk. Energy recovery, RECENERGY) represented the energy content of the cheese compared with that in the milk. This procedure was used to process individual milk samples obtained from 1, 167 Brown Swiss cows reared in 85 herds of the province of Trento (Italy). The assessed traits exhibited almost normal distributions, with the exception of RECFAT. The average values (SD) were as follows: %CYCURD = 14. 97 1. 86, %CYSOLIDS = 7. 18 +/- 0. 92, %CY - WATER 7. 77 1. 27, dCY(CURD) = 3. 63 +/- 1. 17, dCY(SOLIDS) = 1. 74 0. 57, dCY(WATER) = 1. 88 +/- 0. 63, RECFAT = 89. 79 3. 55, RECPROTEIN = 78. 08 +/- 2. 43, 51. 88 3. 52, and RECENERGY = 67. 19 3. 29. All traits were highly influenced by herd-test-date and days in milk of the cow, moderately influenced by parity, and weakly influenced by the utilized vat. Both %CYCURD and dCY(CURD) depended not only on the fat and protein (casein) contents of the milk, but also on their proportions retained in the curd; the water trapped in curd presented an higher variability than that of %CYSOLIDS. All REC traits were variable and affected by days in milk and parity of the cows. The described model cheese-making procedure and the results obtained provided new insight into the phenotypic variation of cheese yield and recovery traits at the individual level...|$|R
40|$|Short chain {{fatty acids}} (SCFA) {{synthesized}} in the rumen from carbohydrate fermentation are an essential energy source for ruminants. Current literature supports that SCFA are absorbed across the rumen epithelium via passive diffusion or protein-mediated transport, however, the rate and {{degree to which}} these pathways adapt {{to a change in}} diet fermentability is unknown. Furthermore, Na+ flux is partially determined by SCFA absorption, and thus is a key indicator of functional changes in the rumen epithelium. The objectives of this study were to determine the time required for a change in SCFA and Na+ absorption across the bovine rumen epithelium and to evaluate the rate and degree to which absorption pathways adapt to an increase in diet fermentability relative to changes in surface area. Twenty-five weaned Holstein steer calves were blocked by body weight and randomly assigned to either the control diet (CON; 91. 5 % hay and 8. 5 % vitamin/mineral supplement) or a moderately fermentable diet (50 % hay; 41. 5 % barley grain, and 8. 5 % vitamin/mineral supplement) fed for 3 (G 3), 7 (G 7), 14 (G 14), or 21 d (G 21). All calves were fed at 2. 25 % BW at 0800 h. Reticular pH was recorded every 5 min for 48 h prior to killing (1000 h). Ruminal tissue was collected for Ussing chamber, barrier function, surface area measurements, and gene expression. Net 22 Na+ flux (JNET-Na; 80 kBq/ 15 mL), the rate and pathway of mucosal to serosal 3 H-acetate (JMS-acetate; 37 kBq/ 15 mL) and 14 C-butyrate (JMS-butyrate; 74 kBq/ 15 mL) flux, and serosal to mucosal flux of 3 H-mannitol (JSM-mannitol; 74 KBq/ 15 mL) and tissue conductance were measured. Half of the chambers assigned to measure JMS-acetate and JMS-butyrate were further assigned to 1 of 2 acetate and butyrate concentration treatments: 10 mM (Low) and 50 mM (High). Furthermore, JSM-mannitol flux was also measured during an acidotic and hyperosmotic challenge (CHAL) and <b>recovery</b> (<b>REC)</b> to measure barrier function of ruminal tissue. Mean reticular pH, which was positively correlated with ruminal pH (R 2 = 0. 5477), decreased from 6. 90 for CON to 6. 59 for G 7 then increased. Net Na+ flux increased 125 % within 7 d. Total JMS-acetate and JMS-butyrate increased from CON to G 21, where passive diffusion was the primary SCFA absorption pathway. Total JMS-acetate and JMS-butyrate were greater when incubated in High vs. Low. Effective surface area of the ruminal epithelium was not affected by dietary treatment. Increased JSM-mannitol, tissue conductance, and increased expression of IL- 1 β and TLR 2 (tendencies) with increased days fed the moderate grain diet indicated reduced rumen epithelium barrier function. Furthermore, the CHAL treatment reduced barrier function, which was not reversible during REC. This study indicates that a moderate increase in diet fermentability increases rumen epithelium absorptive function in the absence of increased SA, but reduces barrier function. Data from this study also suggests that absorption and barrier function follow different timelines, posing a challenge for ruminant diet adaptation to moderately to highly fermentable diets...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Individual and Combined Effects of Hyperthermia, Dehydration and Fatigue on Balance. Megan M. VanSumeren, University of Connecticut Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this controlled, {{randomized}} laboratory {{study was to determine}} the effect of hyperthermia, dehydration and fatigue as both combined and individual factors on balance performance as tested with three separate balance assessment tools. Methods: 12 healthy male subjects (20 ± 2 yrs old, 181. 83 ± 7. 53 cm, 74. 09 ± 8. 43 kg) completed four trials in a randomized order. The four trials were Normothermic, Hydrated (HyN), Normothermic Dehydrated (DehyN), Hyperthermic, Hydrated (HyHot), and Hyperthermic, Dehydrated (DehyHot). Balance was assessed using three tests; static stance, clinical tool Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), and a dynamic stance. Subjects performed the balance assessments three times during each trial; before exercise (pre-test), immediately after exercise (post-test) and after an hour of <b>recovery</b> (<b>rec).</b> The exercise component required subjects to walk on a 5 % incline treadmill for 90 minutes at a pre-determined speed between 3. 0 mph- 4. 0 mph. During the recovery period, subjects sat in the heat chamber with a water perfused suit on in order to maintain their exercising rectal temperature. Subjects were required to wear a 20. 45 kg pack during the entirety of the trial with the exception of the seated recovery period. Dependent variables were: center of pressure (COP), mean sway velocity, mean COP sway path, and average elliptical sway area for both the static and dynamic tests, as well as BESS individual stance scores and BESS total score. Separate repeated measures analyses of variance were performed to evaluate the dependent variables between time (pre-post-rec) and trials (HyN, DehyN, HyHot, DehyHot). Results: For the BESS test, a main effect for time was observed for three of the four stances; SLFirm (F(2, 22) = 5. 37, p=. 01), TanFirm (F(2, 22) = 4. 64, p=. 02), TanFoam (F(2, 22) = 3. 44, p=. 05). The post-test held the highest number of errors on any stance compared with the pre-test and the recovery test. Both the TanFirm and TanFoam revealed a main effect for condition (F(3, 33) = 3. 05, p=. 04, F(3, 33) = 7. 14, p=. 001, respectively). Overall, the DehyHot condition caused the highest BESS scores. For the Dynamic stance, a main effect for time was noticed for the variables of mean COP sway path and velocity (F(2, 22) = 7. 60, p=. 003, F(2, 22) = 7. 61, p=. 003, respectively) with the post-test resulting in the longest and fastest measures. All three variables demonstrated a main effect for condition; sway area (F(1. 93, 21. 26) = 3. 56, p=. 048), sway path (F(3. 33) = 3. 39, p=. 029), velocity (F(3, 33) = 3. 58, p=. 024). The DehyHot trial caused the biggest changes in postural sway. Static results revealed a main effect for time in sway path and sway velocity (F(2, 22) = 4. 03, p=. 032, F(91. 2, 13. 5) = 5. 56, p=. 045, respectively). Post-test scores caused the biggest change in sway. Conclusions: For all three of the balance assessments, there was a decrease in balance ability at post-test. The highest values on any balance assessment took place in the DehyHot trial, suggesting that when combined, dehydration and hyperthermia affect balance. Overall, balance deficits were driven mostly by fatigue in the dehydrated and hyperthermic condition...|$|R
