40|$|The testing {{effect is}} {{the finding that}} prior {{retrieval}} of information from memory will result in better subsequent memory for that material. One explanation for these effects is that initial free <b>recall</b> <b>testing</b> increases the recollective details for tested information, which then becomes more available during a subsequent test phase. In three experiments we explored this hypothesis using a source-monitoring test phase after the initial free <b>recall</b> <b>tests.</b> We discovered that memory is differentially enhanced for certain recollective details depending {{on the nature of}} the free recall task. Thus further research needs to be conducted to specify how different kinds of memorial details are enhanced by free <b>recall</b> <b>testing...</b>|$|R

Next, the participants were given a <b>recall</b> <b>test,</b> in which they were shown one item in each pair and attempted to recall from memory the matching item.

5000|$|Sleep {{benefits}} {{declarative learning}} across {{a range of}} tasks for children and young adults, however little is known of the role that sleep plays for adults when it comes to declarative learning. A study conducted by Wilson, Baran, Schott, Ivry and Spencer [...] sought to see if sleep {{plays an important role in}} declarative learning and motor skill learning in adults. Participants were given two tasks to assess motor skill learning and another to assess declarative learning. The participants learned a motor sequence and list of word pairs during either the morning or evening. Memory tests were given to the participants twice, at twelve and twenty-four hours after training. This gap allowed for a period of sleep, a <b>recall</b> <b>test,</b> a period of normal wake, and a <b>recall</b> <b>test.</b> The study results showed that motor skills were not dependent on sleep. However, declarative learning tasks and recall increased when the participants slept before the <b>recall</b> <b>test.</b> The study also showed that a change in sleep patterns and networks activated during sleep may contribute to age related decline in motor sequences but does not affect declarative learning. This study shows that even though the role of sleep may change throughout age it is still very important to declarative learning regardless of age.|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to investigate {{the effect of the}} types of paired sentences (causal sentence and outcome sentences) and the precision in the sentence (precise and imprecise) on incidental memory. These experiments involved the rating of precision between each target sentence and its paired sentence (causal sentence or outcome sentence) as an orienting task in incidental memory paradigm. Subjects were asked to conduct the orienting task followed by free recall and cued <b>recall</b> <b>tests.</b> One word of each target sentence was used as a cue in cued recall. In the first experiment the type of paired sentences was treated as the within-subjects factor. The performance differences between the causal and the outcome sentences were not observed in both free and cued <b>recall</b> <b>tests.</b> Although there was no performance difference between the precise and the imprecise sentences in free recall, the better performance was observed for the precise sentence in the cued recall. In the second experiment the type of paired sentences was treated as the between-subjects factor. There was no performance difference between the causal and the outcome sentences in both free and cued <b>recall</b> <b>tests.</b> The performance difference between the precise and the imprecise sentences was observed in both free and cued <b>recall</b> <b>tests.</b> The findings obtained in both experiments suggested that {{there was no difference in}} effectiveness between the causal and the outcome informations and that the precision of the both types of informations was critical in incidental memory...|$|R

50|$|Together, these {{components}} form an information retrieval test collection. The test collection {{serves as a}} standard for testing retrieval approaches, {{and the success of}} each approach is measured in terms of two measures: precision and <b>recall.</b> <b>Test</b> collections and evaluation measures based on precision and recall are driving forces behind modern research on search systems. Cleverdon's approach formed a blueprint for the successful Text Retrieval Conference series that began in 1992.|$|E
50|$|The primacy {{effect is}} related to {{enhanced}} remembering. In a study, a free <b>recall</b> <b>test</b> was conducted on some lists of words and no test on other lists of words prior to a recognition test. They found that testing led to positive recency effects for remembered items; on the other hand, with no prior test, negative recency effects occurred for remembered items. Thus, both primary and recency effects {{can be seen in}} remember responses.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to investigate {{the effects of the}} self-generated causal and outcome sentences and the precise and imprecise sentences on incidental memory. Subjects were asked to answer the questions about each target followed by free and cued <b>recall</b> <b>tests.</b> One word in each target sentence was used as a cue in cued recall. In the first experiment the type of self-generated sentences was treated as the within-subjects factor. The self-generated outcome sentences led to better free recall than the causal sentences when the sentences were judged as the precise ones. Although there was no performance difference between the precise and the imprecise sentences in free recall, the better performance was observed for the precise sentence in cued recall. In the second experiment the type of self-generated sentences was treated as the between-subjects factor. The causal, the outcome and the associative information groups were provided.

40|$|A two-process {{model of}} both recall and {{recognition}} is presented. The model is implemented {{in a computer}} simulation {{and is based on}} the results of two factor-analytic studies and one experiment. The first process of the model is a search one that is common to both recall and recognition. The second is a decision, whereby different factors are activated in recall and recognition. These different factors are emerged by the factor analyses. The factor analyses yield two common factors, which are carried out on the basis of the scores of a variety of <b>recall</b> and recognition <b>tests.</b> One factor includes letter-cued <b>recall</b> <b>tests</b> and recognition tests. The other factor includes a variety of <b>recall</b> <b>tests.</b> Additionally, one experiment is reported that examines retrieval aspects of recognition, in which familiarity values are manipulated. The result shows that there is a significant interaction between type of test and familiarity value. The results of factor analyses and one experiment suggest a two-process model of recall and recognition. Implications of the model for recall and recognition are discussed...|$|R

50|$|The {{recognition}} {{failure of}} recallable words is an experimental phenomenon in cognitive psychology originally {{discovered by the}} memory researcher Endel Tulving and colleagues. Although recognition of previously-studied words through a recognition memory test, in which the words are re-presented for a memory judgment, generally yields a greater response probability than the recall of previously studied words through a <b>recall</b> <b>test,</b> in which the words must be mentally retrieved from memory, Tulving found that this typical result could be reversed by manipulating the retrieval cues provided at test.|$|E
5000|$|Researchers {{gave the}} <b>recall</b> <b>test</b> {{to a group}} who did not read the monologue. They scored {{significantly}} lower than the other groups, which indicated that guessing was not easy. [...] In coding the answers to the <b>recall</b> <b>test,</b> exact words were labeled [...] "Verbatim", and correct content but varied wording was labeled [...] "Gist". The combination of [...] "Verbatim" [...] and [...] "Gist" [...] was called [...] "Total Memory." [...] The [...] "Improvisational" [...] group had more [...] "Gist" [...] memories than any other group and had more [...] "Total Memory" [...] than both of the discussion groups. [...] The results fit the researchers' hypothesis that the [...] "Improvisational" [...] group would remember more because they actively rehearsed the information from the monologue. [...] Although other groups had also elaborately encoded the information, the [...] "Improvisation" [...] group remembered significantly more than the discussion groups and marginally more than the [...] "Reading Only" [...] and [...] "Writing" [...] groups. [...] Simply experiencing the monologue in an active way aids in remembering the [...] "Gist." [...] There were no differences across groups for [...] "Verbatim" [...] memory, which they suggest could take longer than the limited time during the experiment to develop.|$|E
50|$|The multiple-learning-context-technique {{is another}} {{strategy}} proposed by Smith to combat context-dependent forgetting. This technique involves presenting subsets {{of the learning}} material in multiple contexts rather than presenting them {{all in the same}} environment. When given a free <b>recall</b> <b>test</b> in a new room, participants who studied in multiple rooms recalled more words than participants who only studied in one room. Smith suggests that when individuals have additional environmental cues their performance will be sustained because it will be less likely that all of the cues will be forgotten.|$|E
40|$|Gesture-based {{interfaces}} {{are becoming}} more prevalent and complex, requiring non-trivial learning of gesture sets. Many methods for learning gestures have been proposed, but they are often evaluated with short-term <b>recall</b> <b>tests</b> that measure user performance, rather than learning. We evaluated four types of gesture guides using a retention and transfer paradigm common in motor learning experiments and found results different from those typically reported with <b>recall</b> <b>tests.</b> The results indicate that many guide systems {{with higher levels of}} guidance exhibit high performance benefits while the guide is being used, but are ultimately detrimental to user learning. We propose an adaptive guide that does not suffer from these drawbacks, and that enables a smooth transition from novice to expert.

50|$|The {{robustness}} of the DRM {{effect and}} {{the simplicity of}} the experimental methods were welcomed in an area of research where small effects and elaborate stimuli were the norm. Furthermore, this paradigm allowed researchers to move past their reliance on recognition tests for false memories. <b>Recall</b> <b>tests</b> are better at showing false memories than recognition tests because subjects are required to access and recall the memory in full themselves, rather than being able to rely on some sense of familiarity. Roediger and McDermott were able to demonstrate a robust effect using <b>recall</b> <b>tests</b> as well as recognition tests, while employing simple word-list stimuli. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the experiments were able to show that subjects not only confidently recognised the nonpresented word, but that they consciously remembered this lure appearing on the list, rather than relying on some feeling of familiarity to make an ‘old’ judgement.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe present {{research}} {{set out to}} investigate if dual modalities of verbal and visual presentations of vocabulary {{in a foreign language}} context are accommodated differently by STM as assessed through recognition and <b>recall</b> <b>tests</b> and also the relationship was examined for possible moderating effect of gender. The analysis indicated STM (high visual and high verbal) accommodates very well to delivery of materials with pictorial and/or written annotation(s), resulting in better learning on both <b>recall</b> and recognition <b>tests.</b> However, the results point to the insignificant relevance of STM to learners’ gender in L 2 vocabulary compared to the verbal/visual processing orientations...|$|R

50|$|In 1974, {{working with}} Graham Hitch, Baddeley {{developed}} an influential model of working memory called Baddeley's model of working memory, which argues {{for the existence}} of multiple short term memory stores and a separate interacting system for manipulating the content of these stores. The model accounts for much of the empirical data on short-term retention and manipulation of information.His landmark study in 1975 on 'Capacity of Short Term Memory' showed that people remembered more short words than long words in a <b>recall</b> <b>test.</b> This was called the word length effect and it demonstrated that pronunciation time rather than number of items determines the capacity of verbal short term memory.|$|E
5000|$|In {{one study}} in 1995, Mark Wheeler {{illustrated}} spontaneous recovery of visual stimuli by presenting students with twelve pictures and allowing them three opportunities {{to study the}} pictures. The students were told this list was only for practice and then were shown two additional [...] "real" [...] lists for which {{they had to do}} the same thing. The students were given a free <b>recall</b> <b>test</b> after the third list for the pictures studied on the first list. Recall suffers significantly at first due to retroactive interference by the two additional lists. However, after thirty minutes free recall of the first-list pictures actually gets better. Perhaps these forgotten items recover because inhibition is gradually decreased.|$|E
40|$|SummaryIf {{you draw}} from memory {{a picture of}} the front of your {{childhood}} home, you will have demonstrated recall. You could also recognize this house upon seeing it. Unlike recognition, recall demonstrates memory for things that are not present. Recall is necessary for planning and imagining, and it can increase the flexibility of navigation, social behavior, and other cognitive skills. Without recall, memory is more limited to recognition of the immediate environment. Amnesic patients are impaired on <b>recall</b> <b>tests</b> [1, 2], and recall performance often declines with aging [3]. Despite its importance, we know relatively little about nonhuman animals' ability to recall information; we lack suitable <b>recall</b> <b>tests</b> for them and depend instead on recognition tests to measure nonhuman memory. Here we report that rhesus monkeys can recall simple shapes from memory and reproduce them on a touchscreen. As in humans [4, 5], monkeys remembered less in <b>recall</b> than recognition <b>tests,</b> and their <b>recall</b> performance deteriorated more slowly. Transfer tests showed that monkeys used a flexible memory mechanism rather than memorizing specific actions for each shape. Observation of recall in Old World monkeys suggests that it has been adaptive for over 30 million years [6] and does not depend on language...|$|R
30|$|The {{experiment}} had a two-factor, quasi-experimental design. The first experimental {{factor was}} the number of tests. Group A (n[*]=[*] 40) took three free-recall tests with a short retention interval before the second test, and group B (n[*]=[*] 37) had two <b>recall</b> <b>tests</b> with a long retention interval. The second, quasi-experimental factor was response pattern (forgotten, reminisced, and consistent). The dependent variables were the number and output-bound accuracy of items recalled.|$|R
50|$|Information encoded {{and stored}} while {{intoxicated}} is retrieved more effectively when later <b>recall</b> <b>tests</b> are performed while intoxicated {{as compared to}} recall while sober. This finding is {{a variation of the}} context-dependency effect of the encoding specificity principle and is much more apparent with low-imagery words than high-imagery words. Both high and low imagery words, however, {{are less likely to be}} recalled while intoxicated due to the inherent nature of intoxication.|$|R
