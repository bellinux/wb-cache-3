50|$|A burster is {{a machine}} that {{separates}} one-part continuous form paper into separate, individual, sheets along the transverse perforations. A burster was typically used with printed continuous form paper applications such as mass-mail advertising, invoices, and account statements. Bursting is done by firmly gripping the second-to-last sheet while <b>feed</b> <b>rollers</b> grip the last sheet firmly and pull it away to burst the perforation. The continuous form paper then advances into the <b>feed</b> <b>rollers</b> to burst the next sheet. Bursting is often a high-speed process that allows the continuous form paper to feed in at a steady rate, with burst pages either stacked or fed into a single-sheet conveyance to the next paper processing stage. Burster equipment and paper manufactures had to generate perforation specifications so that the paper perforations reliably separated under the force of pulling the sheets apart and not tear down into the printed part of the sheet.|$|R

40|$|Rotor spun yarn, {{despite its}} growing popularity, suffers the {{disadvantages}} of lower tenacity, limited count range, and harsh {{handle of the}} resulting fabrics. Therefore, this work probes the possibility of eliminating these drawbacks by using tensile drawing. The yarns are produced with different specifications from the same fibers. The results are encouraging, since contrary to predictions, staple yarns treated this way do perform properly. Tensile drawing especially improves rotor spun yarn quality in terms of structural/mechanical evenness and processability. Other features include increased packing density, reduced yarn diameter, enhanced mechanical rigidity, and even the potential for larger tenacity. The influence of processing variables on yarn properties is also revealed by examining {{the contribution of the}} number of yarn loops mounted on the <b>feed</b> <b>roller</b> and rewinding to drawing and the resulting products. The number of yarn loops wound on the <b>feed</b> <b>roller</b> is significant in terms of drawing tension.

40|$|Issue: Windshields are {{manufactured}} with {{two layers of}} glass with a strong plastic (usually PVC) membrane sandwiched between the panes. This structure limits recyclability dramatically. Plate glass itself is challenging to recycle because of its different chemical composition from container glass.

Separating film plastic from windshield glass requires that the glass be broken adequately to free the film, while keeping the film in large enough pieces that it can be removed without fouling equipment.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} interest worldwide in using tree harvesting biomass as an energy source. Bark retained on logs {{is commonly used}} as an energy source, but is generally removed from eucalypt logs during harvest. In order to evaluate the potential use of eucalypt bark as fuel, {{there is a need}} for information on the productivity and cost implications of retaining eucalypt bark during harvest operations. The study examined the impact of retaining bark on logs on the productivity and costs of a whole-tree to roadside harvesting system in a short-rotation Eucalyptus nitens plantation in Australia being harvested for pulp logs. Trees were felled and bunched with a feller-buncher in spring, then left infield for four weeks to promote bark adhesion and reduce bark loss. A skidder extracted the trees to roadside where a processor processed them to predominantly 10 m logs. Machine productivities were calculated from estimated tree and log volumes and cycle times recorded from video recordings. The feller-buncher's productivity (65 m 3) was less than expected as it appeared to be underpowered to handle the larger trees on the study site. The skidder's productivity (56 m 3) was comparable to those reported in studies under similar conditions and with bark retained. The roadside processor's productivity (25 m 3) was lower than expected. This was believed to result from the operator separately stacking 10 m and 5 m logs, and the lower feed speed resulting from slippage due to the reduced <b>feed</b> <b>roller</b> pressure used in the study to reduce bark loss. Future research could identify <b>feed</b> <b>rollers</b> that increase <b>feed</b> speed while retaining bark. Harvest system costs (AUD 18 GMt− 1) were similar to those reported for a eucalypt roadside processing trial where bark was removed.

40|$|When {{sawn timber}} is planed, the timber is {{to some extent}} {{flattened}} by the <b>feeding</b> <b>rollers</b> and other pressure elements inside the planer, with the plank middle affected {{to a greater degree}} than the top and butt end. As a result, any twist present in rough timber influences the planing process in the proximity of the latter two areas. This is manifested primarily as reduced rectangularity in the affected zones of the planed timber, but also as an increased risk of planer misses. One way to avoid these unwanted features in the end product is to plane an excess length of timber, then cross-cutting to the required final length after planing. This study found low rectangularity to be a larger problem than planer misses, with the top end most affected. The study also indicates that simple models could be used to predict the size of the zone affected by twisting near the ends of planed timber, and thus also the length that must be removed in order to produce an acceptable cross-sectional shape throughout the length of planed timber.

This is achieved, for example, by a V groove and a trapezoidal mating profile. The main advantages are the guidance function exerted simultaneously with the feed function, the comparably low deformation op the conveyed material and the adjustable feed velocity which is almost indepedent of the cross-sectional measurements (e. g. wire diameters) of the material as a result of the suitable design of the roller diameter and the roller profiles...|$|R

In addition to this sensor data, sugarcane yield was also measured to determine the accuracy and resolution of the respective yield monitoring concepts. Yield was determined using two methods and included mill (bin) weight data for individually consigned sub-blocks and weighed 50 m row samples into a weigh truck.

Saving air consumption for drawing-in operation can bring about the total energy saving on the doffing operations. In this report, various conditions on the drawing-in operations are investigated {{in order to improve}} its success rates and to reduce its air consumption. Experiments were performed with changing supplied pressures for the injector and for the ejector, yarn feed speeds and their working time. Acting forces such as the air drag on a spandex yarn were measured and the behaviors of a running yarn were observed during the drawing-in operations. Results obtained are as follows : (1) Each yarn has the unique drawing-in condition in order to improve the rate of success. The higher pressure does not always bring about the higher rate of success for the injector, but for the ejector within the limits of these experiments. (2) The fine tuning in the working time of the injector or the ejector is not so significant because the yarn in the hollow spindle is extended cyclically by the turbulent air flow. The governing factor for the successful drawing-in operation is the yarn capture at the suction entrance.
