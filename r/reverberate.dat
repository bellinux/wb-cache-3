5|$|According to {{historian}} Philippe Leymarie, the French crushing of the Uprising {{resulted in}} the near annihilation of the managerial class in Madagascar, with consequences that continued to <b>reverberate</b> for decades after the country's independence. Many of the leading figures in the Uprising went on to dramatically shape {{the political and social}} landscape of Madagascar after independence. Monja Jaona, who was jailed by the French for nine years, founded the Madagascar for the Malagasy Party (MONIMA) in 1958 shortly after his release. His party was key in leading the rotaka peasant uprising against President Philibert Tsiranana which brought down his neo-colonial administration the following year. After initially supporting Admiral Didier Ratsiraka, Tsiranana's successor, in 1992 Jaona led demonstrations against it and in favor of federalism, being severely wounded in the process. His son, Monja Roindefo, is also an active member of MONIMA and served as Prime Minister under Andry Rajoelina.|$|E
5|$|Back at the TARDIS, Jack begins {{integrating}} the extrapolator into the TARDIS {{to speed up}} the engine recharge. Rose and Mickey hang out together, and he admits to her that he is dating someone else because she is not there for him, and he begs her to promise him that she eventually will come back to him in the end, but before she can answer him, loud sounds like thunder start to <b>reverberate</b> through the area. Cardiff is soon struck by a large earthquake that seems to be coming from the Rift. The Doctor, Margaret, Rose and Jack regroup and find that the extrapolator was a trap meant to redirect the energy from the TARDIS into the Rift, rupturing it. Jack and the Doctor are unable to stop the energy transfer, and Margaret takes Rose hostage and demands the extrapolator. The heart of the TARDIS opens on the console, bathing Margaret in light. While she is captivated by the light, Jack and the Doctor close the rift and disable the extrapolator. As the console closes, they find that Margaret's human suit is empty except for a Slitheen egg. The Doctor surmises that the TARDIS sensed that Margaret wanted a second chance at life and gave it to her. The TARDIS crew decides to return the egg to Raxacoricofallapatorius so Margaret can be raised in a different family. Rose realises Mickey has left without saying goodbye, and runs out to look for him in the nearby area, but he is gone. Rose returns to the TARDIS, clearly distraught, and the Doctor offers to wait a little longer so she can search for Mickey, but she declines, saying that he deserves better.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} the use of {{artificial}} room reverberation methods to increase the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems in highly reverberant enclosures. Our approach consists in training acoustic models on artificially <b>reverberated</b> speech material. In order to obtain the desired <b>reverberated</b> speech training database, we propose to use a <b>reverberating</b> filter whose impulse response is designed to match two highlevel acoustic properties of the target reverberant operating environment, namely the early-to-late energy ratio and the reverberation time. Providing these two parameters are correctly estimated, recognizers trained on speech <b>reverberated</b> with the proposed method outperform systems trained on clean speech, even when conventional channel normalization methods like CMS and logRASTA-PLP are used. 1...|$|R

At {{the peak of the}} pilgrimage season, during November to March, an {{atmosphere}} of devotion is witnessed at Kyaikhtiyo pagoda. As the golden rock gleams in different shades from dawn to dusk (the sight at dawn and at sunset are unique), pilgrims' chants <b>reverberate</b> in the precincts of the shrine. Lighting of candles, meditation and offerings to the Buddha continues throughout the night. Men cross over a bridge across an abyss to affix golden leaves (square in shape) {{on the face of the}} Golden Rock, in deep veneration. However, women are not allowed to touch the rock so cannot cross the bridge. Pilgrims visit the pagoda, from all regions of Myanmar; a few foreign tourists also visit the pagoda. Even disabled persons who are staunch devotees of Buddha visit the pagoda, walking up the track on crutches. Old people, who can not climb, are carried on stretchers by porters to the Pagoda to offer prayers to Buddha. The Full Moon day of Tabaung in March, is a special occasion for pilgrims who visit the shrine. On this day, the platform of the pagoda is lighted with ninety thousand candles as reverential offering to the Lord Buddha. The devotees visiting the pagoda also offer fruits, food and incense to the Buddha.|$|E

They are located either on the head or elsewhere, depending on the insect family. The tympanal organs of some insects are extremely sensitive, offering acute hearing beyond that of most other animals. The female cricket fly Ormia ochracea has tympanal organs {{on each side of}} her abdomen. They are connected by a thin bridge of exoskeleton and they function like a tiny pair of eardrums, but, because they are linked, they provide acute directional information. The fly uses her [...] "ears" [...] to detect the call of her host, a male cricket. Depending on where the song of the cricket is coming from, the fly's hearing organs will <b>reverberate</b> at slightly different frequencies. This difference may be as little as 50billionths of a second, but it is enough to allow the fly to home in directly on a singing male cricket and parasitise it.|$|E

In addition, Zhou was unable to select the successor to his office, possibly {{as a result of his}} role in the Bo Xilai scandal. The head of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, which Zhou headed, no longer held a seat on the Politburo Standing Committee following the 18th Party Congress, as the number of seats on the body were reduced from nine to seven.

Scoppa finds that in each mode, [...] "the guitar sound is sharp-edged and full". #1Record was released in June 1972, and quickly received strong reviews.

Rolling Stone judged the album [...] "exceptionally good", while Cashbox stated, [...] "This album is one of those red-letter days when everything falls together as a total sound", and called it [...] "an important record that should go to the top with proper handling". Proper handling, however, was not forthcoming: Stax Records proved unable to either promote or distribute the record with any degree of success, and even when the band's own efforts to get airplay generated interest, fans were unable to buy it as Stax could not make it available in many stores. Stax, in an effort to improve its catalog's availability, signed a deal with Columbia Records, already successful distributors in the US, making Columbia responsible for the entire Stax catalog. But Columbia had no interest in dealing with the independent distributors previously used by Stax and removed even the existing copies of #1 Record from the stores.|$|E
