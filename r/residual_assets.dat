25|$|Fifth, {{the holders}} of a {{floating}} charge holders must be paid. Like a fixed charge, a floating charge {{can be created}} by a contract with a company before insolvency. Like with a fixed charge, this is usually done {{in return for a}} loan from a bank. But unlike a fixed charge, a floating charge need not refer to a specific asset of the company. It can cover the entire business, including a fluctuating body of assets that is traded with day today, or assets that a company will receive in future. The preferential categories were created by statute to prevent secured creditors taking all assets away. This reflected the view that the power of freedom of contract should be limited to protect employees, small businesses or consumers who have unequal bargaining power. After funds are taken away to pay all preferential groups and the holder of a floating charge, the remaining money due to unsecured creditors. In 2001 recovery rates were found to be 53% of one's debt for secured lenders, 35% for preferential creditors but only 7% for unsecured creditors on average. Seventh comes any money due for interest on debts proven in the winding up process. In eighth place is money due to company members under a share redemption contract. Ninth are debts due to members who hold preferential rights. And tenth, ordinary shareholders, have the right to <b>residual</b> <b>assets.</b>|$|E

40|$|The rise of {{intangible}} assets such as brand names, research and development, patents {{and other forms}} of abstract capital such as digital platforms and data flows has confounded extant measures and concepts of capital and accumulation. What used to be a <b>residual</b> <b>asset</b> category known as &# 039;goodwill&# 039; has now overtaken so-called fixed or tangible assets in the profitability and valuation of many leading corporations. Yet these {{intangible assets}} lead a double life as both spatial and temporal in some dimensions, yet fluid and spatio-temporally elusive in others. Using a framework focused on measuring (by accountants), managing (by corporations) and monitoring (by International Political Economy scholars and regulators), this article explores the longer term implications of accumulation of internationalised capital in intangible and abstract forms, and the prominent role of finance and offshore in giving mobility and fluidity to these forms of capital. The article suggests that while global value chain and global production network analyses have helped researchers and policy-makers to track increasingly fragmented and fluid networks of commodity production, there also is a need to follow the global double life of internationalised and financialised intangible assets and wealth flows, and parallel reorganisations of state forms in response to those transformations...|$|R

In addition, it appears that granting employee stock options motivates banks to reduce their borrowing, as evidenced by lower levels of interest expense and federal funds borrowing.
