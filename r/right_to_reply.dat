25|$|Counsel for the Public Prosecutor {{opens his}} or her case by stating shortly {{the nature of the}} offence charged and the {{evidence}} by which the accused's guilt is proposed to be proved. The prosecution witnesses are then examined, cross-examined for the defence and, if necessary, re-examined by the prosecution. When the case for the prosecution is concluded, the defence may invite the Court to dismiss the case on the basis that there is no case to answer. The Court must decide whether there is evidence against the accused which is not inherently incredible and which satisfies every element of the charge against him or her. If there is no such evidence, the accused must be acquitted. If the Court finds that a case against the accused has been made out, it must call on the accused to give {{his or her}} defence. It is up to the accused {{to decide whether or not}} to offer a defence. If the accused elects to do so, he or she, or his or her advocate, may open the case for the defence, stating the facts or law on which the accused intends to rely and commenting on the evidence for the prosecution. The accused may then examine his or her witnesses, and after their cross-examination by the prosecution and re-examination by the defence, may sum up his or her case. The prosecution may then call persons as witnesses or recall persons already examined for re-examination for rebuttal purposes, and such rebuttal witnesses may be cross-examined by the defence and re-examined by the prosecution. Whether or not the accused has adduced evidence, the prosecution has the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>reply</b> on the whole case.|$|E

He spent much of his time wooing the new Third World states which had recently become independent. The U.S. restricted him to the island of Manhattan, with visits to an estate owned by the USSR on Long Island. The notorious shoe-banging incident occurred during a debate on 12 October over a Soviet resolution decrying colonialism. Infuriated by a statement of the Filipino delegate Lorenzo Sumulong which charged the Soviets with employing a double standard by decrying colonialism while dominating Eastern Europe, Khrushchev demanded the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>reply</b> immediately, and accused Sumulong of being [...] "a fawning lackey of the American imperialists".

The tabloids, however, berated the programme and its makers. The Sun accused the makers of a [...] "cheap scoop" [...] and labelled the programme [...] "IRA propaganda". The Daily Mail was equally robust; its main headline read [...] "fury over SAS 'trial by TV'", while in an inside article, it called the programme [...] "woefully one-sided", and accused Bolton of having previously collaborated with the IRA for sensational news stories. That evening, Bolton agreed to appear on Channel 4's <b>Right</b> <b>to</b> <b>Reply,</b> a show which allowed ordinary viewers to question the makers of controversial television programmes; the programme was pre-recorded, and, unusually, the producers agreed to cut {{the end of the}} recording after one of the participants—a former member of Margaret Thatcher's personal staff claiming to be an impartial viewer—launched an attack on Bolton, in which he accused Bolton of associating with terrorists.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2011, the {{findings}} of two more complaints were released. After the Ofcom ruling, Pedigree Dogs Exposed was re-edited for sale and broadcast abroad. The two complaints claimed that the film was still misleading and did not comply with the Ofcom ruling. The BBC Editorial Standards Committee ruled that the re-edited script which says [...] "the ridge predisposes the dogs to a mild form of Spina Bifida" [...] was still inaccurate. The Committee stated that RSPCA Chief Vet Mark Evans' description of the ridge as a deformity was an expression of his opinion but that the Rhodesian Ridgeback Club representative should {{have been given a}} <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>reply</b> to that criticism.

2500|$|Thiers {{proposed}} a new cabinet, but de Broglie {{and the right}} wing objected that the new government was not conservative enough. A debate and vote of confidence in his government was scheduled for 23 May. The diplomatic corps was in the audience, along with the Thiers family, and Marshal MacMahon, in civilian clothes. De Broglie began the debate, warning that the country needed a firm government of the right because without it the radical party, which had never repudiated the Commune, would win. [...] "Posterity is merciless", he said, [...] "to governments and ministers who by weakness surrender to the enemy the laws and societies they are charged to defend." [...] Under the new rules of the Assembly, Thiers, as President, {{was not allowed to}} respond directly {{on the floor of the}} Assembly. However, he demanded and received the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>reply.</b> He spoke emotionally at length, explaining that he, a longtime supporter of the monarchy, had decided that, [...] "considering the way of things today in the civilized world, for you and me, in practice a monarchy is absolutely impossible." [...] He described accomplishments and policies, and concluded, [...] "What I am describing is a policy of conservatism; the path of our policy is the policy between two extremes." [...] The Assembly then voted, resulting in a declaration of no confidence in the Thiers government by a vote of 362 to 348. The next day, on 24 May, Thiers submitted his resignation as President. The same day, the Assembly voted to replace Thiers with Marshal MacMahon. De Broglie became the head of the new President's council of ministers. De Broglie proclaimed that the new government's priorities would be [...] "to prevent the he invasion of the radical element", and [...] "to strengthen the base of the social order." ...|$|E

6000|$|I beg you not {{to believe}} that if you elicit a reply from me--to your so {{interesting}} letter just received--you do so at any cost to any extreme or uncomfortable pressure that I'm just now under. I am always behind with everything--and it's no worse than usual. Besides I shall be very brief.[A] But I must say two or three words--not only because these are the noblest speculations that can engage the human mind, but because--to a degree that distresses me--you labour under two or three mistakes as to what, the other day, I at all wanted to express. I don't myself, for that matter, recognise what you mean by any [...] "old difference" [...] between us on any score--and least of all when you appear to glance at it as an opinion of mine (if I understand you, that is,) as to there being but one general [...] "hard and fast rule of presentation." [...] I protest that I have never had with you any difference--consciously--on any such point, and rather resent, frankly, your attributing to me a judgment so imbecile. I hold that there are five million such [...] "rules" [...] (or as many as there are subjects in all the world--I fear the subjects are not 5,000,000!) only each of them imposed, artistically, by the particular case--involved in the writer's responsibility to it; and each then--and then only--"hard and fast" [...] with an immitigable hardness and fastness. I don't see, without this latter condition, where any work of art, any artistic question is, or any artistic probity. Of course, a 1000 times, there are as many magnificent and imperative cases as you like of presenting a thing by [...] "going behind" [...] as many forms of consciousness as you like--all Dickens, Balzac, Thackeray, Tolstoi (save when they use the autobiographic dodge,) are huge illustrations of it. But they are illustrations of extreme and calculated selection, or singleness, too, whenever that has been, by the case, imposed on them. My own immortal works, for that matter, if I may make bold, are recognizable instances of all the variation. I [...] "go behind" [...] right and left in [...] "The Princess Casamassima," [...] "The Bostonians," [...] "The Tragic Muse," [...] just as I do the same but singly in [...] "The American" [...] and [...] "Maisie," [...] and just as I do it consistently never at all (save for a false and limited appearance, here and there, of doing it a little, which I haven't time to explain) in [...] "The Awkward Age." [...] So far from not seeing what you mean in Pêcheur d'Islande, I see it as a most beautiful example--a crystal-clear one. It's a picture of a relation (a single relation) and that relation isn't given at all unless given on both sides, because, practically, there are no other relations to make other feet for the situation to walk withal. The logic jumps at the eyes. Therefore acquit me, please, please, of anything so abject as putting forward anything at once specific and a priori. [...] "Then why," [...] I hear you ask, [...] "do you pronounce for my book a priori?" [...] Only because of a mistake, doubtless, for which I do here humble penance--that of assuming too precipitately, and with the freedom of an inevitably too-foreshortened letter, that I was dealing with it a posteriori!--and that on the evidence of only those few pages and of a somewhat confused recollection of what, in Rome, you told me of your elements. Or rather--more correctly--I was giving way to my irresistible need of wondering how, given the subject, one could best work one's self into the presence of it. And, lo and behold, the subject isn't (of course, in so scant a show and brief a piece) [...] "given" [...] at all--I have doubtless simply, with violence and mutilation, stolen it. It is of the nature of that violence that I'm a wretched person to read a novel--I begin so quickly and concomitantly, for myself, to write it rather--even before I know clearly what it's about! The novel I can only read, I can't read at all! And I had, to be just with me, one attenuation--I thought I gathered from the pages already absorbed that your parti pris as to your process with [...] "Eleanor" [...] was already defined--and defined as [...] "dramatic"--and that was a kind of lead: the people all, as it were, phenomenal to a particular imagination (hers) and that imagination, with all its contents, phenomenal to the reader. I, in fine, just rudely and egotistically thrust forward the beastly way I should have done it. But there is too much to say about these things--and I am writing too much--and yet haven't said half I want to--and, above all, there being so much, it is doubtless better not to attempt to say pen in hand what one can say but so partially. And yet I must still add one or two things more. What I said above about the [...] "rule" [...] of presentation being, in each case, hard and fast, that I will go to the stake and burn with slow fire for--the slowest that will burn at all. I hold the artist must (infinitely!) know how he is doing it, or he is not doing it at all. I hold he must have a perception of the interests of his subject that grasps him as in a vise, and that (the subject being of course formulated in his mind) he sees as sharply the way that most presents it, and presents most of it, as against the ways that comparatively give it away. And he must there choose and stick and be consistent--and that is the hard-and-fastness and the vise. I am afraid I do differ with you if you mean that the picture can get any objective unity from any other source than that; can get it from, e.g., the [...] "personality of the author." [...] From the personality of the author (which, however enchanting, is a thing for the reader only, and not for the author himself, without humiliating abdications, to my sense, to count in at all) it can get nothing but a unity of execution and of tone. There is no short cut for the subject, in other words, out of the process, which, having made out most what it (the subject) is, treats it most, handles it, in that relation, with the most consistent economy. May I say, to exonerate myself a little, that when, e.g., I see you make Lucy [...] "phenomenal" [...] to Eleanor (one has to express it briefly and somehow,) I find myself supposing completely that you [...] "know how you're doing it," [...] and enjoy, as critic, the sweet peace that comes with that sense. But I haven't the sense that you [...] "know how you're doing it" [...] when, at the point you've reached, I see you make Lucy phenomenal, even for one attempted stroke, to the little secretary of embassy. And the reason of this is that Eleanor counts as presented, and thereby is something to go behind. The secretary doesn't count as presented (and isn't he moreover engaged, at the very moment--your moment--in being phenomenal himself, to Lucy?) and is therefore, practically, nothing to go behind. The promiscuous shiftings of standpoint and centre of Tolstoi and Balzac for instance (which come, to my eye, from their being not so much big dramatists as big painters--as Loti is a painter,) are the inevitable result of the quantity of presenting their genius launches them in. With the complexity they pile up they can get no clearness without trying again and again for new centres. And they don't always get it. However, I don't mean to say they don't get enough. And I hasten to add that you have--I wholly recognise--every <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>reply</b> to me: [...] "Cease your intolerable chatter and dry up your preposterous deluge. If you will have the decent civility to wait, you will see that I 'present' also--anch' io!--enough for every freedom I use with it!"--And with my full assent to that, and my profuse prostration in the dust for this extravagant discourse, with all faith, gratitude, appreciation and affection, I do cease, dear Mrs. Ward, I dry up! and am yours most breathlessly, ...|$|E
