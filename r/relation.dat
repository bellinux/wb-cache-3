5|$|Because {{different}} embeddings {{may lead}} to different dual graphs, testing whether one graph is a dual of another (without already knowing their embeddings) is a nontrivial algorithmic problem. For biconnected graphs, it can be solved in polynomial time by using the SPQR trees of the graphs to construct a canonical form for the equivalence <b>relation</b> of having a shared mutual dual. For instance, the two red graphs in the illustration are equivalent according to this <b>relation.</b> However, for planar graphs that are not biconnected, this <b>relation</b> is not an equivalence <b>relation</b> {{and the problem of}} testing mutual duality is NP-complete.|$|E

5|$|In recent years, {{concepts}} {{based on}} (re-)cycling resources are increasingly gaining importance. The most prominent among these concepts {{might be the}} Circular Economy, with its comprehensive support by the Chinese and the European Union. There is also {{a broad range of}} similar concepts or schools of thought, including cradle-to-cradle laws of ecology, looped and performance economy, regenerative design, industrial ecology, biomimicry, and the blue economy. These concepts seem intuitively to be more sustainable than the current linear economic system. The reduction of resource inputs into and waste and emission leakage out of the system reduces resource depletion and environmental pollution. However, these simple assumptions are not sufficient to deal with the involved systemic complexity and disregards potential trade-offs. For example, the social dimension of sustainability seems to be only marginally addressed in many publications on the Circular Economy, and there are cases that require different or additional strategies, like purchasing new, more energy efficient equipment. A review of a team of researchers from Cambridge and TU Delft identified eight different relationship types between sustainability and the circular economy, namely a (1) conditional <b>relation,</b> a (2) strong conditional <b>relation,</b> a (3) necessary but not sufficient conditional <b>relation,</b> a (4) beneficial relationship a (structured and unstructured) (5) subset <b>relation,</b> a (6) degree <b>relation,</b> a (7) cost-benefit/trade-off <b>relation,</b> and a (8) selective <b>relation.</b>|$|E

5|$|Over time, {{emphasis}} {{in studies of}} leisure has shifted from the work-leisure <b>relation,</b> particularly in well-researched majorities, to study of minorities and the <b>relation</b> between leisure and culture. Marshall Gordon noted {{that there are two}} approaches in the study of leisure: formal and historical-theoretical. The formal approach focuses on empirical questions, such as the shifting of leisure patterns over an individual's life cycle, the <b>relation</b> between leisure and work, and specific forms of leisure (such as the sociology of sport). The historical-theoretical approach studies the <b>relation</b> between leisure and social change, often from structural-functionalist and neo-Marxist perspectives. Sheila Scraton provided a different analysis, comparing North American and British studies. The British approaches focus on input from pluralism, critical Marxism, and feminism; the American approaches concentrate on the social-psychological tradition.|$|E
