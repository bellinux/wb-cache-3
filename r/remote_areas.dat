40|$|<b>Remote</b> <b>area</b> {{nursing is}} characterised by two known realities: health inequalities and nursing challenges. The health inequalities are complex {{consequences}} of social determinants {{and health care}} access. <b>Remote</b> <b>area</b> nurses must negotiate these realities that powerfully interact. Yet we, as new graduate nurses, contemplate a <b>remote</b> <b>area</b> nursing career pathway with additional points of view, including a strong attraction to the long-lasting image of the ‘Flying Nurse’ within aero medical remote health services. This image holds for us the possibilities of excitement, drama, vital service, and intensive care. This paper explores the realities of this career attraction, and consequently explores the aspirations of contemplative new graduate nurses, as they assimilate their knowledge of <b>remote</b> <b>area</b> nursing with their plans for their future transitions into nursing practice...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} extent to which {{authenticity}} may serve as a competitive advantage for <b>remote</b> <b>area</b> tourism destinations. The challenges facing <b>remote</b> <b>area</b> tourism are described, and two case studies are presented. The first is concerned with the 2 ̆ 7 special interest 2 ̆ 7 activity of bird watching and the second with the more general interest international backpacker market. A review of previous research into these markets suggests that the tourist will seek out <b>remote</b> <b>area</b> destinations where the experiential outcomes are not substitutable, are specific (as opposed to general) in nature and relate to the unique qualities of the setting. In other cases, the costs of <b>remote</b> <b>area</b> travel outweigh the perceived value of authenticity. The paper introduces the concept of 2 ̆ 7 comparative authenticity 2 ̆ 7 as a way of understanding the role authenticity plays in destination selection. <b>Remote</b> <b>area</b> tourism destinations are more likely to find competitive advantage in special interest tourism markets that are less willing to trade the authenticity of a setting for reduced travel costs...|$|R

40|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} exists {{to suggest that}} the incidence of violence directed towards remote and rural health professionals is severe and increasing. Furthermore, some <b>remote</b> <b>area</b> nurses have reported increasing evidence of violent interactions as a significant motivation for their departure from <b>remote</b> <b>area</b> nursing practice. Limited research has been conducted which specifically addresses the risk and experience of violence to health professionals who practice in remote communities [...] . The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the anecdotal evidence that violence is a prevalent stressor to <b>remote</b> <b>area</b> nurses within isolated communities, and to assess their repertoire of coping skills in effectively managing violent situations.

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the dodo may already have been rare or localised before the arrival of humans on Mauritius, since it would have been unlikely to become extinct so rapidly if it had occupied all the <b>remote</b> <b>areas</b> of the island.
