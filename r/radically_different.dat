5|$|Although Du Bois {{attended}} a New England Congregational {{church as a}} child, he abandoned organized religion while at Fisk College. As an adult, Du Bois described himself as agnostic or a freethinker, {{but at least one}} biographer concluded that Du Bois was virtually an atheist.Lewis, p. 550 (agnostic, atheist).Johnson, passim (agnostic). However, another analyst of Du Bois's writings concluded that he had a religious voice, albeit <b>radically</b> <b>different</b> from other African-American religious voices of his era, and inaugurated a 20th-century spirituality to which Ralph Ellison, Zora Neale Hurston, and James Baldwin also belong.|$|E

5|$|Descartes' famous {{argument}} for this position {{can be summarized}} as follows: Seth has a clear and distinct idea of his mind as a thinking thing that has no spatial extension (i.e., it cannot be {{measured in terms of}} length, weight, height, and so on). He also has a clear and distinct idea of his body as something that is spatially extended, subject to quantification and not able to think. It follows that mind and body are not identical because they have <b>radically</b> <b>different</b> properties.|$|E

5|$|Madagascar {{not only}} {{contains}} two <b>radically</b> <b>different</b> climatic zones, the rainforests {{of the east}} and the dry regions of the west, but also swings from extended drought to cyclone-generated floods. These climatic and geographical challenges, along with poor soils, low plant productivity, wide ranges of ecosystem complexity, and a lack of regularly fruiting trees (such as fig trees) have driven the evolution of lemurs' immense morphological and behavioral diversity. Their survival has required the ability to endure the persistent extremes, not yearly averages.|$|E
5|$|Because {{it is so}} {{far from}} the nearest major landmass, the {{ecosystem}} of Kohala has experienced the phenomenon of geographic isolation, resulting in an ecosystem <b>radically</b> <b>different</b> from that of other places. Invasive species introduced by man present a problem to Kohala's ecosystem, as they push native species out of their habitat. There are several initiatives to preserve Kohala's ecosystem. Crops, especially sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), have been harvested on the Leeward side of the volcano for centuries as well. The northern part of the island is named after the mountain, with two districts named North and South Kohala. King Kamehameha I, the first King of the Kingdom of Hawaii, was born in North Kohala, near Hawi.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{complex and}} {{problematic}} relationship between software development methods and practices is well documented. Methods {{are difficult to}} adopt. There are several barriers toward successfully bringing methods to practice, and practices are, {{by the end of}} the day, quite different from method prescriptions. Methods are, however, continually developed, and organisations spend considerable resources trying to improve practices through adoption of new methods. We know relatively little about the long-term dynamics involved in such adoption efforts. This research reports from a three-year effort within an IT department of a large multinational company in which a new method was first introduced, then used to support organisation-wide projects, and subsequently extended based on emerging practices. The study applies two complementary knowledge management perspectives – networks and networking – to interpret the experiences from the case. The study reveals how method perceptions and approaches shift <b>radically</b> through <b>different</b> stages of software method adoption...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} {{neutrality}} on evolutionary search {{are not fully}} understood. In this paper we {{make an effort to}} shed some light on how and why bit-wise neutrality – an important form of neutrality induced by a genotype-phenotype map where each phenotypic bit is obtained by transforming a group of genotypic bits via an encoding function – influences the behaviour of a mutation-based GA on functions of unitation. To do so we study how the fitness distance correlation (fdc) of landscapes changes under the effect of different (neutral) encodings. We also study how phenotypic mutation rates change {{as a function of the}} genotypic mutation rate for different encodings. This allows us to formulate simple explanations for why the behaviour of a GA changes so <b>radically</b> with <b>different</b> types of neutrality and mutation rates. Finally, we corroborate these conjectures with extensive empirical experimentation. 1...|$|R
5|$|Blore's {{new plan}} for the corps de logis of house was {{constrained}} by Vorontsov's wish to use the footings and foundations which had been built for Harrison's original design; this severely restricted the shape, size and layout of the palaces principal rooms. However, rather than erect a compact and low classical villa, as Harrison had designed, Blore's plan was <b>radically</b> <b>different,</b> with strong English Tudor Renaissance features on the northern side, and an eclectic medley of western and Islamic features on the southern. The central bay of the southern facade was inspired by Delhi's Jummah Masjid mosque, which enabled the classical exedra of Harrison's design to be incorporated, once given an Islamic makeover, harmoniously into the design.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Hope was exhibited, Watts had already {{committed}} himself to donate his most significant works to the nation, {{and although he}} received multiple offers for the painting he thought it inappropriate not to include Hope in this donation, {{in light of the}} fact that it was already being considered one of his most important pictures. In mid-1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a duplicate of the piece, with the intention that this duplicate be donated to the nation allowing him to sell the original. Although the composition of this second painting is identical, it is <b>radically</b> <b>different</b> in feel. The central figure is smaller in relation to the globe, and the colours darker and less sumptuous, giving it an intentionally gloomier feel than the original.|$|E

40|$|Workplace {{interaction}} presents different sociopragmatic {{challenges for}} different groups. Expectations {{relating to the}} construction of a convincing professional identity differ <b>radically</b> in <b>different</b> socio-cultural contexts. Those who aspire to senior positions are faced with accomplishing the construction of an appropriately authoritative identity within a culturally constraining environment. For all New Zealanders this entails taking account of an aggressively egalitarian ethos. For Maori, the challenge involves enacting leadership in culturally appropriate ways within a wider institutional context with different cultural values and interactional norms. For skilled migrants attempting to find appropriate employment, the challenge involves constructing a convincing professional identity in an unfamiliar cultural context, while also attending to the relational expectations of their new colleagues in the organisations in which they are working. This paper draws on the extensive research of the Wellington Language in the Workplace Project to explore these issues. An evolving theoretical model provides a useful means of considering the institutional, cultural and interactional constraints within which participants engage at work...|$|R
25|$|Neglect is a {{heterogenous}} {{disorder that}} manifests itself <b>radically</b> differently in <b>different</b> patients. No single mechanism {{can account for}} these different manifestations. A vast array of impaired mechanisms are found in neglect. These mechanisms alone would not cause neglect. The complexity of attention alone—just one of several mechanisms that may interact—has generated multiple competing hypothetical explanations of neglect. So {{it is not surprising}} that it has proven difficult to assign particular presentations of neglect to specific neuroanatomical loci. Despite such limitations, we may loosely describe unilateral neglect with four overlapping variables: type, range, axis, and orientation.|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} {{a detailed analysis}} of both single nucleotide and large insertion/deletion events based on large-scale comparison of 10. 6 Mb of genomic sequence from lemur, baboon, and chimpanzee to human. Using a human genomic reference, optimal global alignments were constructed from large (> 50 kb) genomic sequence clones. These alignments were examined for the pattern, frequency and nature of mutational events. While rates of single nucleotide substitution remain relatively constant (1 - 2 X 10 - 9 substitutions/site/year), rates of retrotransposition vary <b>radically</b> among <b>different</b> primate lineages. These differences have lead to a 15 - 20 % expansion of human genome size over the last 50 million years of primate evolution, 90 % of it due to new retroposon insertions. Orthologous comparisons with the chimpanzee suggest that the human genome continues to significantly expand due to shifts in retrotransposition activity. Assuming that the primate genome sequence we have sampled is representative, we estimate that human euchromatin has expanded 30 Mb and 550 Mb when compared to the primate genomes of chimpanzee and lemur respectively. ...|$|R
5|$|Hope is a Symbolist oil {{painting}} by the English painter George Frederic Watts, {{who completed the}} first two versions in 1886. <b>Radically</b> <b>different</b> from previous treatments of the subject, it shows a lone blindfolded female figure sitting on a globe, playing a lyre that has only a single string remaining. The background is almost blank, its only visible feature a single star. Watts intentionally used symbolism not traditionally associated with hope to make the painting's meaning ambiguous. While his use of colour in Hope was greatly admired, {{at the time of}} its exhibition many critics disliked the painting. Hope proved popular with the Aesthetic Movement, who considered beauty the primary purpose of art and were unconcerned by the ambiguity of its message. Reproductions in platinotype, and later cheap carbon prints, soon began to be sold.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to dogs, cats have not undergone major changes during the domestication process, as {{the form and}} behavior of the domestic cat is not <b>radically</b> <b>different</b> from those of wildcats and domestic cats are perfectly capable of surviving in the wild. Fully domesticated house cats often interbreed with feral F. catus populations, producing hybrids such as the Kellas cat. This limited evolution during domestication means that hybridisation can occur with many other felids, notably the Asian leopard cat. Several natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats may have predisposed them for domestication as pets. These traits include their small size, social nature, obvious body language, love of play and relatively high intelligence. Several small felid species may have an inborn tendency towards tameness.|$|E

5|$|Many {{programming}} {{languages are}} already widely accepted and understood.

Use of an entirely new language relies on a business's ability to acquire new developers. Additionally, the existing code base of a business {{would need to be}} discarded. Finally, a business would need to acquire a new toolchain (suite of tools) for development, which is often both an expense in both money and time. Primary concerns about roadmaps for the adoption of new technologies tend to be the need to train new developers and adapt existing processes to the new technology.|$|E

40|$|When {{conservation}} biology {{emerged as an}} identifiable organized discipline in the late 1980 s [for histories, see Sarkar (1998, 2002) ], it was already apparent {{that it would have}} to draw its principles and practices from many different biological specialties including genetics, evolution and, especially, ecology (Soulé 1985). However, besides this single point of agreement, the practice of {{conservation biology}} diverged <b>radically</b> in <b>different</b> cultural and political contexts. In the North, particularly in the United States, humans were perceived as being essentially separated from nature, and their presence was taken to be the main reason for biodiversity depletion; human exclusion and wilderness preservation became major tenets of the new discipline. For many of these conservation biologists, the discipline’s normative foundations were provided by “deep ecology” (Sessions 1995), a doctrine of questionable intellectual cogency and considerable ethical dubiety [for critiques see, for example, Salleh (1984) and Guha (1989) ]. In sharp contrast, in the South, parti-cularly in India and Latin America, biological conservation was viewed to be so closely integrated to cultural traditions in which the conservation of biodiversity was seen as part of the biocultural restoration of degraded habitats and the preservation of cultural practices that co-evolved in harmon...|$|R
