5|$|The French, German and Hungarian co-production of {{the film}} was fraught with {{difficulty}} and obstacles. The first of these was the suicide in February 2005, days before shooting was due to begin, {{of the film}}'s French producer, Humbert Balsan. As the original financing of the film collapsed, the remaining producers managed to secure stop-gap funding which allowed them to shoot nine days of footage on the expensive Corsican sets, until they were shut down through legal action by the local subcontractor. After many expressions of support from European film organisations, production companies and government bodies, a new co-production contract was signed in July 2005 with a <b>revised</b> <b>budget</b> and shooting schedule. It then emerged that all rights to the film had been ceded to a French bank under the original production agreement, and only after further changes in the film's backers was a deal struck with the bank to allow shooting to resume in March 2006, over a year later than had been originally envisaged.|$|E
25|$|A {{study from}} Oxford University {{found that the}} sports-related costs of London 2012 was USD 15 billion, {{compared}} to USD 4.6 billion for Rio 2016, USD 40-44 billion for Beijing 2008 and USD 51 billion for Sochi 2014, the most expensive Olympics in history. Cost per athlete was USD 1.4 million. This does not include wider costs for urban and transport infrastructure, which often cost {{as much or more}} than the sports-related costs. In 2005 London secured the bid for the 2012 Summer Games with a cost estimate that two years later proved inadequate and was revised upwards with around 100 percent. Then, when {{it turned out that the}} final outturn costs were slightly below the <b>revised</b> <b>budget,</b> the organizers falsely, but very publicly, claimed that the London Games had come in under budget. Main media, including the BBC, reported the false claim as true. In fact, London 2012 went over budget by 76% in real terms, measured from bid to completion.|$|E
25|$|The JWST has {{a history}} of major cost overruns and delays which have {{resulted}} from outside factors such as delays in deciding on a launch vehicle and adding extra funding for contingencies. The first budget estimates were that the observatory would cost $1.6 billion and launch in 2011, but NASA has now scheduled the telescope for a 2019 launch on a budget that has grown to $8.8 billion. In 2011, the United States House of Representatives voted to terminate funding, after about $3 billion had been spent and 75% of its hardware was in production. Funding was restored and capped at $8 billion. , the telescope remained on schedule for a spring 2019 launch and within the 2011 <b>revised</b> <b>budget.</b> One of the reasons why the cost grew so much is {{that it is difficult to}} forecast the cost of development, and in general budget predictability improved when initial development milestones were achieved.|$|E

500|$|Mayor Daley {{at first}} placed {{much of the}} blame for the delay and cost overrun on Frank Gehry, who {{designed}} the pavilion and its connecting bridge; Daley's office later apologized to the architect. A 2001 investigative report by the Chicago Tribune described the park then under construction and its budget overruns as an [...] "expensive public-works debacle that can be traced to haphazard planning, design snafus and cronyism".

500|$|Following the April 2005 {{release of}} Jean Brault's {{damaging}} testimony at the Gomery Commission, implicating the Liberals in the scandal, opinion polls placed the Conservatives ahead of Liberals. The Conservatives had earlier abstained from {{the vote on}} the 2005 budget to avoid forcing an election. With the collapse in Liberal support and a controversial NDP amendment to the budget, the party exerted significant pressure on Harper {{to bring down the}} government. In May, Harper announced that the government had lost the [...] "moral authority to govern". Shortly thereafter, the Conservatives and Bloc Québécois united to defeat the government on a vote that some considered to be either a confidence motion or else a motion requiring an immediate test of the confidence of the House. The Martin government did not accept this interpretation and argued that vote had been on a procedural motion, although they also indicated that they would bring forward their <b>revised</b> <b>budget</b> for a confidence vote the following week. Ultimately, the effort to bring down the Government failed following the decision of Conservative MP Belinda Stronach to cross the floor to the Liberal Party. The vote on the NDP amendment to the budget tied, and with the Speaker of the House voting to continue debate, the Liberals stayed in power. At the time, some considered the matter to be a constitutional crisis.|$|E
