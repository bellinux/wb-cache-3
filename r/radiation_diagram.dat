This papers deals with antenna modeling using Partial Element Equivalent Circuit (PEEC) models. Antenna properties including input impedance, <b>radiation</b> <b>diagrams</b> and gain are computed from PEEC model results. The input impedance is computed directly by using the currents and voltages at the feed-point of the antenna. The <b>radiation</b> <b>diagrams</b> are computed in a post-processing step by treating each volume cell as an infinitesimal dipole and using the superposition principle to compute the radiated field. The computed results are compared to analytical results for dipoles. For more complex antenna structures the computed results are compared with measurements and results from other computational methods. Accurate and fast results shows that the method is promising as an antenna system design tool. Godkänd; 2006; 20061114 (ysko...|$|R

The {{aim of the}} present paper is the numerical modeling of the two-frequency planar cross-slot antenna designed for operation in the receiving system of the orbital telescope Cosmic Origins Explorer (COrE), developed by the European Space Agency to measure the CMB. The proposed antenna is a planar metal layer on the dielectric substrate, and comprising a set of four slots intersecting each other at right angles. The composition also includes a set of microstrip lines for transmitting a signal from the resonant slots to cold-electron bolometers, and a lens for forming the main beam of the <b>radiation</b> <b>diagram.</b> Calculation of the antenna system is made by electrodynamic modeling software package CST Microwave Studio. As {{a result of the}} modeling, the <b>radiation</b> <b>diagram</b> of the antenna in two frequency channels as well as its frequency characteristics are obtained.
