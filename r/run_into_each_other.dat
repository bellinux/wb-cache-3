5|$|Thick as a Brick {{was viewed}} by some critics as Jethro Tull's first {{progressive}} rock album. The album has {{a variety of}} musical themes, time signature changes and tempo shifts – all of which were features of the progressive rock scene. Although the finished album runs as one continuous piece, it is made up of a medley of individual songs that <b>run</b> <b>into</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> none of which individually lasts {{more than a couple of}} minutes. Parts of the suite blend classical and folk music into the typical rock music framework.|$|E

He insists they sleep {{at his home in}} Indianapolis, ruining their night. The next day, Leslie and Ben <b>run</b> <b>into</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> alone and Ben reveals Chris is out for the day. Ben then immediately kisses her, leaving Leslie simultaneously delighted and nervous about their future.|$|E

25|$|Layer-by-layer growth – In {{this growth}} mode, islands {{nucleate}} {{on the surface}} until a critical island density is reached. As more material is added, the islands continue to grow until the islands begin to <b>run</b> <b>into</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> This is known as coalescence. Once coalescence is reached, the surface has a large density of pits. When additional material {{is added to the}} surface the atoms diffuse into these pits to complete the layer. This process is repeated for each subsequent layer.|$|E

500|$|Seal script in turn {{evolved into}} the other {{surviving}} writing styles; the first writing style to follow was the clerical script. [...] The development of such a style {{can be attributed to}} those of the Qin Dynasty who were seeking to create a convenient form of written characters for daily usage. In general, clerical script characters are [...] "flat" [...] in appearance, being wider than the seal script, which tends to be taller than it is wide. Compared with the seal script, clerical script characters are strikingly rectilinear.

2500|$|Allison Keene of Collider.com {{awarded the}} season 3 stars out of 5 {{after seeing the}} first six episodes. She called the season [...] "a confused, choppy mix of the supernatural seen {{through the lens of}} {{business}} casual... Despite a very good cast and a great origin story, Iron Fist is predictable, a little hammy, and has no real sense of how to tell a cohesive story. As such, it has a few moments that are great and many that are not." [...] Keene also noted the [...] "glacial pace forces plot points and character interactions to be drawn out to a ludicrous degree. Even when things do pick up from there, the editing is choppy, the narrative doesn’t connect particularly well, and Danny’s personality and decision making abilities are split somewhere between an adult man and a 12-year-old boy (which is no real fault of Jones’ — he comes off as charming). It leaves the show with a lot of moving parts and a lot of potential, but ultimately without a central drive or clear motivations." [...] Keene agreed with Fienberg on the lack of villain the season presented as well as, [...] "a very awkwardly shoe-horned Claire Temple", noting at this point it is [...] "less and less believable as each show wears on that the eventual Defenders haven’t <b>run</b> <b>into</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> or that these connecting characters don’t bother mentioning other supers they know [...]" [...] She concluded that instead of presenting [...] "what could have been the boldest" [...] of the Marvel Netflix series, it instead [...] "doubled-down on the problems" [...] the other series had instead of learning from them.|$|E

[...] During an initially awkward conversation, the king suggests a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors to see who gets both Shiny Stones, but is forced to battle the Pirat captain as he pilots his choice, which turns out to be [...] "ship with lots of cannons". [...] When the machine is defeated, Turncoat pulls the second stone from King. [...] This enrages the latter enough to engage in fisticuffs with the former, only to have both Shiny Stones escape their grasp and fall into a pool of lava. [...] The lava erupts, sending the king, the captain and the Pirat's ship flying upward. [...] The captain kicks the king back to the ground and boards his ship as it reaches orbit.
