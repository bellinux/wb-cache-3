5|$|Kirchner {{proposed}} a fiscal austerity program in early 2012, including the gradual removal of subsidies. The proposal {{turned out to}} be unpopular, and was not implemented. She opted instead to send a bill to Congress for the <b>renationalization</b> of YPF, privatized in 1993, blaming the Spanish company Repsol for the energy trade deficit. The bill was approved by the Chamber of Deputies by a 207-32 margin. It was criticized as an authoritarian move, as there was no negotiation with Repsol. As well, the Vaca Muerta oil field had been discovered by this time. However, YPF was unable to afford the costs to exploit the oil at the site, and the rights to drill at Vaca Muerta were sold to the Chevron Corporation. The costs of energy imports increased the trade deficit and the inflation rate, and power outages became frequent. Outages usually took place on the hottest days of the summer season, as the use of air conditioning increased electricity consumption to peak levels.|$|E
25|$|President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner of Argentina {{introduced}} a bill on April 16, 2012 for the partial <b>renationalization</b> of YPF, the nation's largest energy firm. The state would purchase a 51% share, with the national government controlling 51% of this package and ten provincial governments receiving the remaining 49%. The bill was overwhelmingly approved by both houses of Congress, and was signed by the president on May 5.|$|E

40|$|This study tests {{alternative}} {{hypotheses about}} firm-level determinants {{of the government}} incentives to acquire controlling stakes in private companies. Using a novel hand-collected dataset of 153 largest listed and unlisted Russian companies, I investigate {{the economic and political}} rationale of a 2004 - 2008 wave of selected nationalizations and provide new evidence on the methods and characteristics of such takeovers in a post-privatization emerging market. I find that formerly privatized companies in strategically important sectors face the highest risks of corporate control transfers from private to state hands. I also find that contrary to commonly held beliefs, {{there is little evidence that}} <b>renationalizations</b> in Russia are driven by economic factors: the government neither systematically “cherry-picks ” best performers nor addresses market failures by rescuing underperformers. These results contribute to the politics and finance literature by providing new firm-level evidence on the importance of political rationale in the government’s decision to intervene into the corporate control structures...|$|R

Corporate assets as of 2012 had tripled to over USD1.6 billion, as the group's fleet grew from 26 to 63 planes and the average age of same was reduced from 20 years to 7.5.|$|E
25|$|The {{aforementioned}} amendment of {{the judiciary}} was repealled by the Supreme Court, which ruled the law to be unconstitutional. The Front for Victory is defeated at the October midterm elections, with a sound victory of Sergio Massa at the populous Buenos Aires Province. Still, the government retains the majority {{in both houses of}} the Congress. The Supreme Court rules the media law to be constitutional, a pair of days after the election. Cristina Fernández, who was under medical treatment during both events, changed the cabinet at her return, appointing Jorge Capitanich as chief of cabinet, Axel Kicillof as minister of economy, Juan Carlos Fábrega as president of the Central Bank, and Carlos Casamiquela as minister of Agriculture. The interior trade secretary Guillermo Moreno resigns the following day. The international controversy over the <b>renationalization</b> of YPF ends with a financial compensation for Repsol. The year ends with several electricity blackouts and with police revolts at several provinces, which causes looting.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{minority}} shareholder, the Petersen Group, held a 25% stake at {{the time}} of the <b>renationalization,</b> and had financed their initial purchase of 15% of the stock in 2007 with a vendor’s loan from Repsol for €1.5 billion. The chairman and majority owner of the Petersen Group, Enrique Eskenazi, was close to President Néstor Kirchner, who supported Eskenazi's bid to become YPF's principal Argentine stockholder. Eskenazi benefited from a dividend distribution rate at YPF of 90%, which allowed the Group to repay its vendor's loan in installments. The 2008 agreement required Repsol to buy back shares owned by the Group and to assume the loan should the Madrid-based firm lose majority control of YPF. Sebastián Eskenazi, the son of the Petersen Group chairman and CEO of YPF until April 16, indicated however that the group would forego this option. The Group defaulted in May on a Credit Suisse loan taken in 2011 to raise its stake in YPF from 15% to 25%. Officials at Credit Suisse and at other creditors involved, including Banco Itaú, BNP Paribas, and Goldman Sachs, announced on May 11 that the Group's shares would be repossessed as collateral. Repsol, as another of the Group's creditors affected by their default, also repossessed a block of shares, thus increasing their stake in YPF to 12%; following a steep rally in YPF shares, Repsol sold its stake a year later.|$|E

Goldman coined the term [...] "petrostate": Petrostate: Putin, Power, and the New Russia, where he inter alia argued that while Putin had followed the advice of economic advisers in implementing reforms such as a 13 percent flat tax and creating a stabilization fund to lessen inflationary pressure, his main personal contribution {{was the idea of}} creating [...] "national champions" [...] and the <b>renationalization</b> of major energy assets.

2500|$|The reform {{resulted}} in new generation facilities, which were built and {{financed by the}} private sector, and investment in distribution by the privatized companies. Thanks to the new investments, {{between the end of}} 2000 and mid-2003, effective capacity experienced a 43% increase, with the distribution network also showing improvement. This led to temporary reduction in blackouts and distribution losses and increasing operating efficiency, the combination of which translated in improvements in the quality of service. Unserved energy decreased to 11% of the potential demand in 2002, down from 40% in 1991. In the same period, capacity deficits to meet unsuppressed demand were estimated to have fallen from 30% to 16%. However, rising oil prices, the introduction of generalized subsidies and political interference negatively affected the sector's financial health. In 2003, these unfavorable conditions and strong political pressure led the government to repurchase Union Fenosa's shares in the privatized distribution companies EdeNorte and EdeSur. These companies have experienced a deteriorating operating efficiency since their <b>renationalization.,</b> ...|$|E

50|$|Described by his biographer as “the {{economic}} guru who captivated Cristina Kirchner,” Kicillof {{was instrumental}} in the 2012 <b>renationalization</b> of the energy firm YPF. It was on his advice that President Fernández de Kirchner decided not to meet holdout bondholder demands to be repaid what they were owed in 2014. The decision was supported by among others the United Nations, the Organization of American States, the G-77 (133 nations), the Council on Foreign Relations, the American Bankers Association, and bondholders whose payments were stopped by the 2014 ruling.|$|E

YPF was privatized in 1993 and bought by the Spanish firm Repsol S.A. in 1999; the resulting merger produced 'Repsol YPF'.

50|$|Nationalization, or nationalisation, is {{the process}} of {{transforming}} private assets into public assets by bringing them under the public ownership of a national government or state. Nationalization usually refers to private assets or assets owned by lower levels of government, such municipalities, being transferred to the state. The opposites of nationalization are privatization, municipalization and demutualization. When previously nationalized assets are privatized and subsequently returned to public ownership by a later government, they are said to have undergone <b>renationalization</b> or renationalisation. Industries that are usually subject to nationalization include transport, communications, energy, banking and natural resources.|$|E
50|$|YPF {{shares of}} total output fell 8 points to 34% in oil, and 12 points to 23% in natural gas; its declines in output {{represented}} 54% of lost oil production and 97% {{in the case}} of natural gas. The company's oil production had declined by a further 7%, and gas by 9%, during 2011. Production declines of 6% annually under Repsol were reversed following the <b>renationalization,</b> however. Amid sharp increases in profitability and investment, output in 2013 rose by 3.4% in oil and a 2.2% in gas, and a further 8.7% and 12.5% in oil and gas, respectively, during 2014.|$|E

Other state-owned {{power companies}} are ENELBAR and ENELVEN-ENELCO (approximately 8% of capacities). In 2007, PDVSA bought 82.14% percent of Electricidad de Caracas (EDC) from AES Corporation as part of a <b>renationalization</b> program. Subsequently the ownership share rose to 93.62% (December 2008). EDC has 11% of Venezuelan capacity, and owns the majority of conventional thermal power plants. The rest of the power production is owned by private companies.|$|E
50|$|After {{disintegration}} of multinational states like Yugoslavia and Soviet Union, besides {{the process of}} <b>renationalization</b> of history, there is sometimes also retroactive nationalization of victims or tragedies {{of the people that}} in past lived in those states. According to new national historical narratives, the reason for some people were the victims of certain tragedies was because they were of a certain nationality, for example the Ukrainians of the Soviet Union. Nationalist discourse in Croatia presents the Bleiburg tragedy as an event where only Croatians suffered and died just because they were Croatians, eluding {{the fact that many of}} the victims were Serbs, Montenegrins or Slovenians while many Croatians had died while fighting as collaborators against Yugoslav partisans.|$|E
