40|$|Q-methodology is a {{technique}} incorporating the benefits of both qualitative and quantitative research. Q-method involves Q-sorting, a {{method of data collection}} and factor analysis, to assess subjective (qualitative) information. The use of Q-sorting and factor analysis has often resulted in the misconception that Q-methodology involves psychometric or quantitative assessment, although Q as a methodology actually enables the systematic assessment of qualitative data. Misconceptions regarding Q have resulted in a heterogeneous collection of Q-applications in the extant literature, which has obscured the fundamental principles of Q-methodology. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a systematic review of Q-based research to investigate the criteria researchers have used to develop Q-studies. Published research studies between January 2008 and December 2008 that employed Q-techniques and methodology were assessed. Data were extracted and synthesized through the development and use of the Assessment and <b>Review</b> <b>Instrument</b> for Q-methodology (ARIQ). Fourteen research studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. The Q-methodological studies were disparate in their application of terminology, instrument development, and factor analysis, although data extraction and synthesis processes revealed two types of studies: those which aimed to apply conventional Q-methodology and those which applied variations of Q-techniques. It is concluded that variations of Q-technique and its methodology are unavoidable. However, this does not obviate the need for researchers to explicitly state their rationale for decisions to deviate from conventional Q-methodology if they are to produce demonstrably valid research. The <b>review</b> <b>instrument</b> (ARIQ) developed for this review will facilitate this end...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND There is a {{vast amount}} of {{international}} literature which, although agreeing on the need for advanced practice nurse roles, simultaneously debates and discusses the difficulties with nomenclature, definition and subsequent implementation of such roles. Due to this ambiguity it is difficult to equally compare evidence in this field across different countries. A context-specific systematic review on the qualitative evidence of the experience of being an advanced practice nurse in Australia has not been undertaken previously, however it is imperative for nursing managers and leaders to understand the complexities of advanced nursing roles in order to effectively utilise and retain these experienced and valuable nurses. With the creation of a national nursing regulating authority in 2010, it is timely to explore in-depth the experience of being an advanced practice nurse from a national perspective. OBJECTIVE To identify the experience of being an advanced practice nurse working in Australian acute care settings. INCLUSION CRITERIA TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS Registered nurses working in advanced practice roles in acute care settings throughout Australia.

Methods We developed a 7 -point structured implicit <b>review</b> <b>instrument</b> that encompasses four aspects of care, including the physician's initial data gathering, integration of information and development of appropriate diagnoses; initial treatment plan and orders; and plan for disposition and follow-up. Two pediatric emergency medicine physicians applied the 5 -item instrument to children presenting in the highest triage category to four rural EDs, and we assessed the reliability of the average summary scores (possible range of 5 – 35) across the two reviewers using standard measures. We also validated the instrument by comparing this mean summary score between those with and without medication errors (ascertained independently by two pharmacists) using a two-sample t-test. Results We reviewed the medical records of 178 pediatric patients for the study. The mean and median summary score for this cohort of patients were 27. 4 and 28. 5, respectively. Internal consistency was high (Cronbach's alpha of 0. 92 and 0. 89). All items showed a significant (p Conclusion The instrument we developed to measure quality of care provided to children in the ED has high internal consistency, fair to good inter-rater reliability and inter-rater correlation, and high content validity.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Primary research, {{including}} qualitative research, as well {{as experts}} working in social services and aged care have identified the mixed feelings carers experience when the person they have been caring for is admitted into a residential aged care facility permanently. They have raised the importance of understanding these experiences {{as a means to}} implementing policies and programs that enhance carers' well-being. This systematic review was motivated by the need to use evidence to inform effective and feasible interventions to support carers, and the absence of a systematic review synthesizing the qualitative evidence on how carers experience this transition. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this qualitative systematic review was to identify and synthesize the evidence on the experiences of carers of older people when the person they had been providing care for is admitted permanently into a residential aged care facility, and to draw recommendations from the synthesis of the evidence on these experiences to enhance policy and programming aimed at supporting affected caregivers. INCLUSION CRITERIA: TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS:  All carers of people who had experienced the person they had been caring for at home being moved into a residential aged care facility permanently.   PHENOMENA OF INTEREST:  Experiences of the caregiver of the older person when the person they have been caring for at home is admitted into a residential aged care facility permanently.  Types of studies: The review considered qualitative studies, including but not limited to designs such as phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography and action research.  Types of outcomes: The outcomes are in the form of synthesized findings pertaining to carers' experiences when the person they have been caring for is admitted into a residential aged care facility permanently. SEARCH STRATEGY: A comprehensive search of leading databases which are sources of qualitative published and unpublished studies was conducted between 18 September 2013 and 10 November 2013. The search considered studies reported in English and published from the database inception to 10 November 2013. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Papers selected for retrieval were assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and <b>Review</b> <b>Instrument.</b> DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted from identified papers using the standardized data extraction tool from the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and <b>Review</b> <b>Instrument.</b> The data extracted included descriptive details about the phenomena of interest, populations and study methods. DATA SYNTHESIS: The Joanna Briggs Institute meta-aggregative approach for synthesizing qualitative evidence was used.

40|$|BACKGROUND Maternal {{mortality}} remains unacceptably high in {{many parts}} of the world today, even though the majority of these deaths are preventable. Between 1990 and 2015, the fifth Millennium Development Goal aspires to reach the goal of reducing maternal mortality by 75 %, and in many low-income countries, this ambitious target appears to be beyond reach. OBJECTIVES To systematically review the strategies that have reduced maternal mortality within four countries: Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Sri Lanka. INCLUSION CRITERIA Textual and opinion papers that explored strategies to reduce maternal mortality in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Sri Lanka were included. Participants included pregnant and birthing women who received care from a skilled birth attendant. TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS Pregnant and birthing women who received care from a skilled birth attendant within Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Sri Lanka. PHENOMENA OF INTEREST The review considered publications that described: 1. The health system/service delivery structures and underlying policy; 2. The maternity care provided by a skilled birth attendant. TYPES OF PUBLICATIONS This review considered government reports, expert opinion, discussion papers, position papers, and other forms of text published in the English language. Technical reports, statistical reports and epidemiological reports were excluded. TYPES OF OUTCOMES The primary outcome of interest in this review was: Impact on maternal mortality rates. Secondary outcomes of interest to this review included: a) Changes to health system structures related to pregnancy and childbirth (including resources/finances) b) Change in cultural practices related to pregnancy and birth c) Empowerment of women and their position in society (and what impact this has had with respect to their choice of pregnancy and birth care). SEARCH STRATEGY Published and unpublished English language articles from 2000 through to 2010 were identified with electronic searches of medical and social science databases. In addition, bibliographies of articles were examined for eligible studies. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY Textual papers were assessed by two independent reviewers for authenticity prior to inclusion in the review using standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Narrative, Opinion and Text Assessment and <b>Review</b> <b>Instrument.</b> DATA COLLECTION Textual data was extracted from papers included in the review using the standardized data extraction tool from the Joanna Briggs Institute Narrative, Opinion and Text Assessment and <b>Review</b> <b>Instrument.</b> DATA SYNTHESIS Textual papers were, where possible, pooled using the Joanna Briggs Institute Narrative, Opinion and Text Assessment and <b>Review</b> <b>Instrument.</b> The process of meta-synthesis involved the extraction of conclusions, which were grouped into categories, then analyzed to generate synthesized findings. RESULTS Thirty-three text and opinion papers met the inclusion criteria. Nine syntheses were derived with key themes related to decreasing maternal mortality, including professionalization of midwifery, free and equitable healthcare, strengthening of health systems, appropriate task-shifting, access issues for women, empowerment of women, improved data collection methods and global assistance from neighboring countries when required. CONCLUSIONS A combination of these nine essential factors, when empowered by an enabling environment, will lead to provision of skilled attendance for all birthing women. All governments, health professionals who work to provide skilled attendance, and women and their communities must work together with a shared commitment to tackle these issues of maternal mortality.
