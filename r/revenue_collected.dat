5|$|The toll {{collected}} by Autocesta RijekaZagreb {{for use of}} the A6 motorway is not reported separately. Autocesta RijekaZagreb only reports it total toll revenue, including toll <b>revenue</b> <b>collected</b> on the A7 motorway (RupaJurdani section) and the A1 motorway (LučkoBosiljevo2 section) {{as well as on the}} Krk Bridge. In the first half of the 2010 their toll revenue was 188.2 million Croatian kuna (25.3 million euros).|$|E
5|$|The toll {{collected}} by Hrvatske autoceste along the A3 motorway from January to August 2009 {{was reported to}} comprise the largest proportion of the total toll <b>revenue</b> <b>collected</b> by the company for the period: 889.8 millionkuna (approximately 121.9 millioneuro). Even though this figure is not further decomposed into the individual sections of motorway, {{it is clear from}} the traffic volume data analysis that the largest portion of the toll revenue is collected on the sections between Zagreb and Slavonski Brod, and especially on those sections closest to the Ivanja Reka interchange.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, the Barmouth Viaduct Access Group (B-VAG), was {{established}} to investigate an alternative route from the town centre to the bridge, as the current walkway is steep, narrow, and unsuitable for buggies or wheelchairs. In June, the toll was removed after the collectors left and were not replaced. The council have not yet decided {{how to pay for}} the bridge's maintenance costs, which were £39,405 for the year. This has proved to be problematic as the <b>revenue</b> <b>collected</b> from tolls has not been sufficient to cover the council's share of costs, and there is not a sufficient budget to employ any full-time staff to collect payments.|$|E

5|$|The FairTax is a {{national}} tax, but can be administered by the states rather than a federal agency, which may have a bearing on compliance as the states' own agencies could monitor and audit businesses within that state. The 0.25% retained by the states amounts to $5 billion the states would have available for enforcement and administration. For example, California should receive over $500 million for enforcement and administration, {{which is more than}} the $327 million budget for the state's sales and excise taxes. Because the federal money paid to the states would be a percentage of the total <b>revenue</b> <b>collected,</b> John Linder claims the states would have an incentive to maximize collections. Proponents believe that states that choose to conform to the federal tax base would have advantages in enforcement, information sharing, and clear interstate revenue allocation rules. A study by the Beacon Hill Institute concluded that, on average, states could more than halve their sales tax rates and that state economies would benefit greatly from adopting a state-level FairTax.|$|E
5|$|Nawabs of Murshidabad succeeded the Nawabs of Bengal as Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad, {{following}} Mansur Ali Khan's abdication They got {{the title}} changed {{as the title}} of the Nawab of Bengal was abolished in 1880. They had little or no say in the share of the <b>revenue</b> <b>collected</b> and were ceased to use any force. After Indian Independence in 1947 it was declared that the princely states must accede to either India or Pakistan (East/West Pakistan). Murshidabad (the capital city) became a part of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) for two days, as it had a Muslim majority. It became a part of India on 17 August 1947, following which the Pakistani flag was brought down from the Hazarduari Palace and the Indian tricolour was hoisted atop it. After merging with India, they had no power as the Government of India took over all the princely states in India. The house of the Nawabs appeared to have come to end in 1969 with Waris Ali Mirza being the last reigning Nawab and with no clear succession. Although he left three sons and three daughters there was no clear successor to the title after his death because he disinherited one and the others disputed his will.|$|E

25|$|There {{was also}} an {{economic}} analysis that showed that the largest part of the economic benefit from road pricing {{was not in the}} relief of congestion but in the <b>revenue</b> <b>collected,</b> which would only be released when the revenue is used.

25|$|Quli Khan {{continued}} his policy of sending {{part of the}} <b>revenue</b> <b>collected</b> to the Mughal Empire.

He justified his action by saying that {{it would be impossible to}} run the Mughal Empire without the revenue he sent. Historian Chowdhury says that his real reason was to show his loyalty to the Mughal Emperor so that he could run the state according to his own wishes.|$|E

25|$|In January 2008, {{the mayor}} of Milan, Letizia Moratti, {{launched}} the Ecopass program expecting a 30% cut in pollution levels and a 10% reduction in traffic.

Despite the fact that these vehicles having less polluting engines, the free access helped less with the congestion problem.
