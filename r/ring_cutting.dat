50|$|Fort Rock {{was created}} when basalt magma {{rose to the}} surface and {{encountered}} the wet muds of a lake bottom. Powered by a jet of steam, molten basalt was blown into the air, creating a fountain of hot lava particles and frothy ash. The pieces and blobs of hot lava and ash rained down around the vent and formed a saucer-shaped ring of lapilli tuff and volcanic ash sitting like an island in the lake waters. Steam explosions also loosened angular chunks of black and red lava rock comprising the valley floor. These blocky inclusions are incorporated into the fine-grained tuff layers at Fort Rock. Waves from the lake waters eroded the outside of the <b>ring,</b> <b>cutting</b> the steep cliffs into terraces 66 ft above the floor of Fort Rock Valley.|$|E

50|$|By this time, serious gunnery {{malfunctions}} {{had caused}} intermittent {{problems with the}} main armament, leading to a 26% reduction in output. According to Captain Leach, he decided that continuing the action would risk losing Prince of Wales without inflicting further damage on the enemy. He therefore ordered the ship to make smoke and withdraw, 'pending a more favourable opportunity'. Prince of Wales turned away just after 06:04, firing from her rear turret under local control until the turret suffered a jammed shell <b>ring,</b> <b>cutting</b> off the ammunition supply and making the guns inoperable. Despite efforts by crew members and civilian technicians to repair the shell ring, all four guns were not back in service until 08:25, although {{two of the four}} guns were serviceable by 07:20. This temporarily left only five 14 in guns operational, but nine of the ten were operational in five hours. The final salvos fired were ragged and are believed to have fallen short. The ship retired from the battle around 06:10. Thirteen of her crew had been killed, nine were wounded. The timing of Prince of Wales withdrawal was fortunate for her, as she had come into torpedo range of Prinz Eugen and turned away as the German cruiser was about to fire.|$|E

Theoretical models and experimental results have shown improvements on the tribological performance of these systems regarding untextured systems, working under the same conditions. This paper presents a numerical model for getting relationships among the operational conditions (load, speed, and dynamic viscosity), the minimum lubricate film thickness, the friction coefficient and the conditioned micro-topography of a plain sliding bearing working under a hydrodynamic regime.

50|$|The {{growth of}} diamond {{directly}} on a substrate allows {{the addition of}} many of diamond's important qualities to other materials. Since diamond has the highest thermal conductivity of any bulk material, layering diamond onto high heat producing electronics (such as optics and transistors) allows the diamond {{to be used as}} a heat sink. Diamond films are being grown on valve <b>rings,</b> <b>cutting</b> tools, and other objects that benefit from diamond's hardness and exceedingly low wear rate. In each case the diamond growth must be carefully done to achieve the necessary adhesion onto the substrate. Diamond's very high scratch resistance and thermal conductivity, combined with a lower coefficient of thermal expansion than Pyrex glass, a coefficient of friction close to that of Teflon (Polytetrafluoroethylene) and strong lipophilicity would make it a nearly ideal non-stick coating for cookware if large substrate areas could be coated economically.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{fabricate}} micro surface textures on alumina ceramic, {{the effects of}} single pulse intervals processing and <b>ring</b> <b>cutting</b> processing on the laser surface textures were discussed. The advantages and disadvantages between the two kinds of processing method were compared. The crater diameter and depth increase {{with the increase of}} laser pulse energy, and the increasing number of pulses significantly affects the crater depth for the single pulse intervals processing. As for the <b>ring</b> <b>cutting</b> processing method, micro-pit depth changes with the average power, whereas the micro-pit diameter mainly changes with scan radium. By optimizing laser processing parameters the micro-pit dimensions could be independently controlled. These two methods could process micro-pits with different diameters and depth on alumina ceramic.

40|$|Abstract. The {{residual}} stress in cold ring rolling could cause great error to parts quality. Due to the complicated formation of {{residual stress}}, it's difficult to calculate theoretically. In present study, measurement method is generally used. According {{to the shape}} of <b>ring,</b> <b>cutting</b> method is the best method for measuring residual stress. There were 6 stages in cold rolling deep groove ball bearing race. Electric wire discharge machine was used to cut the rings after rolling in each stage. The radius of rings would change after cutting. According to the derived analytic calculation theory of residual stress, the residual stress could be calculated in different rolling stage. The residual stresses were in the range of 110 - 200 MPa. Compared the measurement results from finite element simulation results, the greatest difference was 20 %, which was in accepted rang. Through calculation results of six stages in cold ring rolling, it could found that the residual stress increased with the increase of deformation, the straightening stage was benefit to decrease residual stress...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} produce {{precision}} ring shaped parts using the turning process depends significantly on the workholding characteristics. Workholding parameters such {{as the number of}} jaws and chucking force are known to influence the roundness tolerance of ring shaped parts commonly used in bearing applications. Experimental trial and error methods are often used in practice to optimize the workholding parameters to achieve the desired part quality. This thesis develops a systematic mathematical approach for optimizing these parameters using a finished cut roundness prediction model and a model for determining the reaction force between the chuck jaws and the ring. The roundness prediction model is verified through experiments for different cutting conditions. The optimization approach takes as input the required roundness tolerance, geometry and mechanical properties of the <b>ring,</b> <b>cutting</b> forces, and the coefficient of friction between the jaws and the ring. The output consists of the minimum number of jaws and the range of acceptable chucking forces that satisfy the required tolerance while preventing slip of the ring. Simulation examples are used to illustrate the proposed workholding optimization approach for a hard turning application. In addition, based on the optimization model, the thesis proposes a novel concept of dynamic chucking force control that promises to yield part roundness that is superior to conventional chucking. M.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the vegetative rescue of adult Anadenanthera macrocarpa trees through the induction of epicormic shoots from tree severance and stem ringing, {{as well as the}} efficiency of cutting technique on the propagation of the species. The experimental design used was random plots, in a 2 X 2 factorial arrangement, constituted by two techniques for the induction of basal shoots (tree severance and stem <b>ringing)</b> and <b>cuttings</b> types (herbaceous cuttings and semihardwoods cuttings), in four replicates and plots of 12 cuttings per repetition. The tree severance and stem ringing were efficient in the induction of basal shoots in adult A. macrocarpa trees. However, the tree severance provided higher emission of basal shoots. The herbaceous cuttings presented higher rooting percentages, independent of vegetative rescue technique. In general, we conclude that the vegetative rescue and the vegetative propagation of A. macrocarpa adult trees are technically efficient...|$|R

40|$|The Galileo Orbiter {{examined}} several {{impact features}} on Europa at considerably better resolution than was possible from Voyager. The new data {{allow us to}} describe the morphology and infer the geology of the largest impact features on Europa, which are probes into the crust. We observe two basic types of large impact features: (1) "classic" impact craters that grossly resemble well-preserved lunar craters of similar size but are more topographically subdued (e. g., Pwyll) and (2) very flat circular features that lack the basic topographic structures of impact craters such as raised rims, a central depression, or central peaks, and which largely owe their identification as impact features {{to the field of}} secondary craters radially sprayed about them (e. g., Callanish). Our interpretation is that the classic craters (all < 30 km diameter) formed entirely within a solid target at least 5 to 10 km thick that exhibited brittle behavior on time scales of the impact events. Some of the classic craters have a more subdued topography than fresh craters of similar size on other icy bodies such as Ganymede and Callisto, probably due to the enhanced viscous relaxation produced by a steeper thermal gradient on Europa. Pedestal ejecta facies on Europa (and Ganymede) may be produced by the relief-flattening movement of plastically deforming but otherwise solid ice that was warm at the time of emplacement. Callanish and Tyre {{do not appear to be}} larger and even more viscously relaxed versions of the classic craters; rather they display totally different morphologies such as distinctive textures and a series of large concentric structural <b>rings</b> <b>cutting</b> impact-feature-related materials. Impact simulations suggest that the distinctive morphologies would not be produced by impact into a solid ice target, but may be explained by impact into an ice layer approximately 10 to 15 km thick overlying a low-viscosity material such as water. The very wide (near antipodal) separation of Callanish and Tyre imply that approximately 10 - 15 km may have been the global average thickness of the rigid crust of Europa when these impacts occurred. The absence of detectable craters superposed on the interior deposits of Callanish suggests that it is geologically young (< 10 (exp 8) years). Hence, it seems likely that our preliminary conclusions about the subsurface structure of Europa apply to the current day...|$|R
50|$|The story {{opens with}} a brief prologue about the <b>ring's</b> {{disappearance}} before <b>cutting</b> to Aragorn (Adrian Webster) and Gandalf (Patrick O'Connor) at an inn (presumably the Prancing Pony) in Bree. Gandalf explains his concerns about Gollum's knowledge of the Ring falling into enemy hands, and asks Aragorn to find the creature with his tracking skills. After initially having little luck, Aragorn crosses paths with a fellow ranger and distant kinsman named Arithir (Arin Alldridge), a Ranger of the North, who reports hearing rumours about a creature that has been stealing fish from open windows in local villages; the movie cuts to a scene of Gollum doing just that, and eating his ill-gotten gain atop the roof.|$|R
5000|$|The stratigraphic {{method of}} {{estimating}} the age of a crater is somewhat crude and imprecise, {{and the result is}} questioned by Underhill's non-impact hypothesis. [...] Assuming an impact origin, other possible ways of dating the event include looking for evidence of ejecta material such as tektites, and deposits from the hypothesised tsunami, which might be found anywhere around the North Sea basin. [...] As well as allowing a more accurate age determination, finding such evidence would also strengthen the impact hypothesis. Two nearby oil exploration wells penetrate the <b>ring</b> system, yet <b>cutting</b> samples from these fail to provide any independent support for the meteor theory, thus weakening the case for it being due to an extraterrestrial body.|$|R
50|$|Hand-dug wells are {{excavations}} with diameters {{large enough}} to accommodate one or more people with shovels digging down to below the water table. The excavation is braced horizontally to avoid landslide or erosion endangering the people digging. They can be lined with laid stones or brick; extending this lining upwards above the ground surface to form a wall around the well serves to reduce both contamination and injuries by falling into the well. A more modern method called caissoning uses reinforced concrete or plain concrete pre-cast well rings that are lowered into the hole. A well-digging team digs under a <b>cutting</b> <b>ring</b> and the well column slowly sinks into the aquifer, whilst protecting the team from collapse of the well bore.|$|R
50|$|The main form of {{ring saw}} uses a ring or wire {{that is like}} a flat disk. The non-cutting side of the blade is behind of the cutting edge, so limits {{the depth of the}} cuts that may be made. Wire-saws are coated with an {{abrasive}} on all sides and so may cut in any direction. With the <b>ring</b> behind the <b>cutting</b> edge, cuts in the main direction will treat the blade (in mechanical terms) as an arch, which is stiffer than a sideways force on a cylindrical blade. This geometry also gives a vertical cut in thick materials, although the cut must be kept straight and unlike a bandsaw, curves cannot be sawn if the material is thick. They may be used for mineralogy and slabbing.|$|R
40|$|Sizing {{electrodes}} is {{an important}} step during Lithium-ion battery manufacturing processes since poor cut edge affects battery performance significantly and sometime leads to fire hazard. Mechanical cutting could result in a poor cut quality with defects. The cutting quality can be improved by using a laser, due to its high energy concentration, fast processing time, small heat-affected zone, and high precision. The cutting quality is highly influenced by operating parameters such as laser power and scanning speed. Thus, we studied a numerical simulation to provide a guideline for achieving clear edge quality. In order to simulate electrodes laser cutting for Lithium-Ion batteries, understanding the behavior of current collectors is crucial. This study focuses on current collectors, such as pure copper and aluminium. Numerical studies utilized a 3 D self-consistent mathematical model for laser-material interaction. Observations of penetration time, depth, and threshold du <b>ring</b> laser <b>cutting</b> processes of current collectors are described. The model is validated experimentally by cutting current collectors and single side-coated electrodes with a single mode fiber laser. The copper laser cutting is laser intensity and interaction time dependent process. The aluminium laser cutting depends more on laser intensity than the interaction time. Numerical and experimental results show good agreement...|$|R
50|$|Quality control {{proved to}} be inadequate, engines were often {{delivered}} with improperly cleaned castings, broken piston <b>rings</b> and machine <b>cuttings</b> left inside the engine. Mechanics were overworked {{trying to keep the}} Sabres running and during cold weather they had to run them every two hours during the night so that the engine oil would not congeal and prevent the engine from starting the next day.

To make matters worse, mechanics and pilots unfamiliar with the different nature of the engine, tended to blame the Sabre for problems that were caused by incorrect handling. This was exacerbated by the representatives of the competing Rolls-Royce company, which had its own agenda. In 1944, Rolls-Royce produced its own version called the Eagle.|$|R
