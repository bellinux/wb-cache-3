25|$|The {{electromagnetic}} waves in a (metal-pipe) waveguide may be imagined as travelling down the guide in a zig-zag path, being repeatedly reflected between opposite {{walls of the}} guide. For the particular case of <b>rectangular</b> <b>waveguide,</b> {{it is possible to}} base an exact analysis on this view. Propagation in a dielectric waveguide may be viewed in the same way, with the waves confined to the dielectric by total internal reflection at its surface. Some structures, such as non-radiative dielectric waveguides and the Goubau line, use both metal walls and dielectric surfaces to confine the wave.|$|E
25|$|By January 1942, a {{team working}} on the antenna problem had {{developed}} an initial concept consisting of a long <b>rectangular</b> <b>waveguide</b> with small slots cut into the front side. The concept was an early example of what is today {{referred to as a}} slot antenna. Radio signals escaping through a slot would interfere with the signal from other slots, strongly suppressing the signal in certain directions while adding up in others. The result was a tightly focused beam. However, given the frequencies available, in the X band, any antenna wide enough to produce useful resolution proved to also be wide enough to generate very strong side lobes. These ruined the display, not only leaking away signal uselessly, but also causing returns from the sides of the antenna that could not be distinguished from ones in front of it.|$|E

500|$|The {{nomenclature}} for modes in {{a cavity}} introduces a third index, for example TE011. [...] The first two indices describe the wave travelling {{up and down}} the length of the cavity, that is, they are the transverse mode numbers as for modes in a waveguide. [...] The third index describes the longitudinal mode caused by the interference pattern of the forward travelling and reflected waves. [...] The third index is equal to the number of half wavelengths {{down the length of the}} guide. [...] The most common modes used are the dominant modes: TE101 in <b>rectangular</b> <b>waveguide,</b> and TE111 in circular waveguide. [...] TE011 circular mode is used where very low loss (hence high Q) is required but cannot be used in a dual-mode filter because it is circularly symmetric. [...] Better modes for <b>rectangular</b> <b>waveguide</b> in dual-mode filters are TE103 and TE105. [...] However, even better is the TE113 circular waveguide mode which can achieve a Q of 16,000 at [...]|$|E
500|$|The {{slotted line}} {{is one of}} the basic {{instruments}} used in radio frequency test and measurement at microwave frequencies. [...] It consists of a precision transmission line, usually co-axial but waveguide implementations are also used, with a movable insulated probe inserted into a longitudinal slot cut into the line. [...] In a co-axial slotted line, the slot is cut into the outer conductor of the line. [...] The probe is inserted past the outer conductor, but not so far that it touches the inner conductor. [...] In a <b>rectangular</b> <b>waveguide,</b> the slot is usually cut along the centre of the broad wall of the waveguide. [...] Circular waveguide slotted lines are also possible.|$|E
500|$|Waveguides are a {{low-loss}} medium. [...] Losses in waveguides mostly {{come from}} ohmic dissipation caused by currents induced in the waveguide walls. [...] <b>Rectangular</b> <b>waveguide</b> has lower loss than circular waveguide {{and is usually}} the preferred format, but the TE01 circular mode is very low loss and has applications in long distance communications. [...] Losses can be reduced by polishing the internal surfaces of the waveguide walls. [...] In some applications which require rigorous filtering, the walls are plated with {{a thin layer of}} gold or silver to improve surface conductivity. [...] An example of such requirements is satellite applications which require low loss, high selectivity, and linear group delay from their filters.|$|E

500|$|In <b>rectangular</b> <b>waveguide,</b> the TE10 mode (shown {{in figure}} 2) is the {{dominant}} mode. [...] There is a band of frequencies between the dominant mode cutoff and the next highest mode cutoff in which the waveguide can be operated without any possibility of generating spurious modes. [...] The next highest cutoff modes are TE20, at exactly twice the TE10 mode, and TE01 which is also twice TE10 if the waveguide used has the commonly used aspect ratio of 2:1. [...] The lowest cutoff TM mode is TM11 (shown in figure 2) which is [...] times the dominant mode in 2:1 waveguide. [...] Thus, there is an octave over which the dominant mode is free of spurious modes, although operating too close to cutoff is usually avoided because of phase distortion.|$|E
500|$|An iris {{is a thin}} {{metal plate}} across the {{waveguide}} {{with one or more}} holes in it. [...] It is used to couple together two lengths of waveguide and is a means of introducing a discontinuity. [...] Some of the possible geometries of irises are shown in figure 5. [...] An iris which reduces the width of a <b>rectangular</b> <b>waveguide</b> has an equivalent circuit of a shunt inductance, whereas one which restricts the height is equivalent to a shunt capacitance. [...] An iris which restricts both directions is equivalent to a parallel LC resonant circuit. [...] A series LC circuit can be formed by spacing the conducting portion of the iris away from the walls of the waveguide. [...] Narrowband filters frequently use irises with small holes. [...] These are always inductive regardless of the shape of the hole or its position on the iris. [...] Circular holes are simple to machine, but elongated holes, or holes {{in the shape of a}} cross, are advantageous in allowing the selection of a particular mode of coupling.|$|E

This directional coupler is composed of three parallel dielectric <b>rectangular</b> <b>waveguides</b> cores which are placed at equal space in the dielectric medium.

In the central waveguide, the fundamental mode is incident from perfect part toward the periodic structure of this waveguide.

40|$|An {{improved}} vector {{finite-element method}} {{has been used}} for the solution of general anisotropic waveguide problems. This method is formulated in terms of all three components of the magnetic field and is valid for arbitrary tensor permittivity. In the improved finite-element analysis, the spurious nonphysical solutions do not appear when the effective refractive index is larger than 1. Therefore, this method is very useful for the analysis of the surface-wave modes of optical waveguides.

Furthermore, our measurements show that the loss tangent tanδ strongly dependents on the PTFE composite where tan δ∼ 2 × 10 ^- 6 of PTFE have been reported at cryogenic temperatures [46, 47] about a factor of 4 lower than those measured here. This suggests that the loss of superconducting coaxial cables may also be further reduced.|$|R
