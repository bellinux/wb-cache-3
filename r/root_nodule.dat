5|$|Some trees {{such as the}} alders (Alnus species) have a {{symbiotic}} relationship with Frankia species, a filamentous bacterium that can fix nitrogen from the air, converting it into ammonia. They have actinorhizal root nodules on their roots in which the bacteria live. This process enables the tree to live in low nitrogen habitats where they would otherwise be unable to thrive. The plant hormones called cytokinins initiate <b>root</b> <b>nodule</b> formation, in a process closely related to mycorrhizal association.|$|E
25|$|A {{classic example}} of {{mutualism}} is the interaction between rhizobia soil bacteria and legumes (Fabaceae). In this interaction, rhizobia bacteria induce <b>root</b> <b>nodule</b> formation in legume plants via an exchange of molecular signals. Within the root nodules, rhizobia fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia using the nitrogenase enzyme. The legume benefits from a new supply of usable nitrogen from the rhizobia, and the rhizobia benefits from organic acid energy sources from the plant {{as well as the}} protection provided by the <b>root</b> <b>nodule.</b> Since the rhizobia live within the legume, {{this is an example of}} endosymbiosis, and since both the bacteria and the plant can survive independently, it is also an example of facultative symbiosis.|$|E
500|$|Root nodules {{containing}} Rhizobium bacteria {{have been}} found on R. regia trees in India. [...] The presence of rhizobia-containing root nodules is usually associated with nitrogen fixation in legumes; {{this was the first}} record of root nodules in a monocotyledonous tree. [...] Further evidence of nitrogen fixation was provided by the presence of nitrogenase (an enzyme used in nitrogen fixation) and leghaemoglobin, a compound which allows nitrogenase to function by reducing the oxygen concentration in the <b>root</b> <b>nodule.</b> [...] In addition to evidence of nitrogen fixation, the nodules were also found to be producing indole acetic acid, an important plant hormone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Root</b> <b>nodules</b> {{apparently}} have evolved three times within the Fabaceae but are rare outside that family. The propensity {{of these plants}} to develop <b>root</b> <b>nodules</b> seems to relate to their root structure. In particular, a tendency to develop lateral roots in response to abscisic acid may enable the later evolution of <b>root</b> <b>nodules.</b>|$|R
40|$|Mycorrhizal <b>root</b> <b>nodules</b> {{occur in}} the conifer {{families}} Araucariaceae, Podocarpaceae, and Sciadopityaceae. Although the fossil record of these families {{can be traced back}} into the early Mesozoic, the oldest fossil evidence of <b>root</b> <b>nodules</b> previously came from the Cretaceous. Here we report on cellularly preserved <b>root</b> <b>nodules</b> of the early conifer Notophytum from Middle Triassic permineralized peat of Antarctica. These fossil <b>root</b> <b>nodules</b> contain fungal arbuscules, hyphal coils, and vesicles in their cortex. Numerous glomoid-type spores are found in the peat matrix surrounding the nodules. This discovery indicates that mutualistic associations between conifer <b>root</b> <b>nodules</b> and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi date back to at least the early Mesozoic, the period during which most of the modern conifer families first appeared. Notophytum <b>root</b> <b>nodules</b> predate the next known appearance of this association by 100 million years, indicating that this specialized form of mycorrhizal symbiosis has ancient origins...|$|R
40|$|Legumes are an {{important}} plant functional group since they can form a tripartite symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing Rhizobium bacteria and phosphorus-acquiring arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). However, not much is known about AMF community composition in legumes and their <b>root</b> <b>nodules.</b> In this study, we analyzed the AMF community composition in the roots of three nonlegumes and in the <b>roots</b> and <b>root</b> <b>nodules</b> of three legumes growing in a natural dune grassland. We amplified {{a portion of the}} small-subunit ribosomal DNA and analyzed it by using restriction fragment length polymorphism and direct sequencing. We found differences in AMF communities between legumes and nonlegumes and between legume <b>roots</b> and <b>root</b> <b>nodules.</b> Different plant species also contained different AMF communities, with different AMF diversity. One AMF sequence type was much more abundant in legumes than in nonlegumes (39 and 13 %, respectively). <b>Root</b> <b>nodules</b> contained characteristic AMF communities that were different from those in legume roots, even though the communities were similar in nodules from different legume species. One AMF sequence type was found almost exclusively in <b>root</b> <b>nodules.</b> Legumes and <b>root</b> <b>nodules</b> have relatively high nitrogen concentrations and high phosphorus demands. Accordingly, the presence of legume- and nodule-related AMF {{can be explained by the}} specific nutritional requirements of legumes or by host-specific interactions among legumes, <b>root</b> <b>nodules,</b> and AMF. In summary, we found that AMF communities vary between plant functional groups (legumes and nonlegumes), between plant species, and between parts of a root system (<b>roots</b> and <b>root</b> <b>nodules)</b> ...|$|R

2500|$|The rhizobia {{and their}} hosts {{must be able}} to {{recognize}} each other for nodule formation to commence. Rhizobia are specific to particular host species although a rhizobia species may often infect more than one host species. This means that one plant species may be infected by more than one species of bacteria. For example, nodules in Acacia senegal can contain seven species of rhizobia belonging to three different genera. [...] The most distinctive characteristics that allow rhizobia to be distinguished apart are the rapidity of their growth and the type of <b>root</b> <b>nodule</b> that they form with their host. Root nodules can be classified as being either indeterminate, cylindrical and often branched, and determinate, spherical with prominent lenticels. Indeterminate nodules are characteristic of legumes from temperate climates, while determinate nodules are commonly found in species from tropical or subtropical climates.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{function}} of nodulin genes and the activity of their promoters, the Agrobacterium rhizogenes transformation strategy was adopted for Sesbania rostrata. Two protocols were selected to generate S. rostrata transgenic roots that can be nodulated efficiently after application of Azorhizobium caulinodans, ORS 571. Cotransformation frequencies of 22 and 72 % were obtained with {{the first and second}} protocol, respectively. The transgenic <b>root</b> <b>nodules</b> showed no apparent differences when compared with the wild-type <b>root</b> <b>nodules.</b> The screening procedure for cotransformation of binary T-DNA in transgenic <b>roots</b> and <b>root</b> <b>nodules</b> was optimized by using an enhanced green-fluorescent protein construct.

40|$|Many legumes form {{tripartite}} symbiotic {{associations with}} rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Rhizobia {{are located in}} <b>root</b> <b>nodules</b> and provide the plant with fixed atmospheric nitrogen, while AMF colonize plant roots and deliver several essential nutrients to the plant. Recent studies showed that AMF are also associated with <b>root</b> <b>nodules.</b> This might point to interactions between AMF and rhizobia inside <b>root</b> <b>nodules.</b> • Here, we test whether AMF colonize <b>root</b> <b>nodules</b> in various plant-AMF combinations. We also test whether nodules that are colonized by AMF fix nitrogen. • Using microscopy, we observed that AMF colonized the <b>root</b> <b>nodules</b> of three different legume species. The AMF colonization of the nodules ranged from 5 % to 74 % and depended on plant species, AMF identity and nutrient availability. However, AMF-colonized nodules were not active, that is, they did not fix nitrogen. • The results suggest that AMF colonize old senescent nodules after nitrogen fixation has stopped, although {{it is also possible}} that AMF colonization of nodules inhibits nitrogen fixation. © The Authors (2006) ...|$|R
