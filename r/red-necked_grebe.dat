50|$|The {{breeding}} {{range of the}} <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> overlaps {{with that of the}} Slavonian grebe, although the latter species tends to be displaced from sites suited to both. The <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> prefers an inland temperate climate, and is less successful near coasts and in subarctic and warm temperate zones. It is usually a lowland bird, breeding below 100 m, although has nested at up to 1800 m in Turkey.|$|E
50|$|<b>Red-necked</b> <b>grebe.</b> The <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> is {{a common}} summer visitor in the Park and Recreation Area. It nests in shallow open water and {{shoreline}} beds or bulrushes. The bird nests in the park from May until August. During the 1993 survey, {{the largest number of}} birds were found on Ironwood, Pinehurst, Shaw, and Touchwood Lakes. The survey found 814 red-necked grebes in total residing in the Park and Recreation Area. Red-neck grebe nests are susceptible to disturbance by power boats.|$|E

50|$|The Damonte Ranch {{is also a}} {{place where}} {{numerous}} birds reside and migrate through. Northern Nevada is a migratory path of harlequin duck, cackling goose, <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe,</b> and medium-sized diurnal birds of prey, white-tailed kite, broad-winged hawk.|$|E
5000|$|Loons and grebes. The South Arm Marshes are {{frequented by}} many loon and grebe species, {{especially}} during {{spring and fall}} migrations. The most easily observed are the common loon, red-throated loon, horned grebe, <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> and western grebe.|$|E
50|$|Bird species {{found at}} the lake may include Pacific loons, ring-necked duck, bufflehead, American wigeon, {{northern}} pintail, northern shoveler, green-winged teal, <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe,</b> horned grebe, Bonaparte's gull, Wilson's snipe, lesser yellowlegs, long-billed dowitcher, red-necked phalarope, pectoral sandpiper and Bohemian waxwing.|$|E
50|$|After {{breeding}} {{the adults}} moult their wing feathers and are temporarily flightless; migration commences once the flight feathers have regrown. The <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> is normally single-brooded, although second broods and re-nesting after a clutch {{has been lost}} may extend nesting into July or August.|$|E

50|$|The <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> (Podiceps grisegena) is a migratory {{aquatic bird}} {{found in the}} {{temperate}} regions of the northern hemisphere. Its wintering habitat is largely restricted to calm waters just beyond the waves around ocean coasts, although some birds may winter on large lakes. Grebes prefer shallow bodies of fresh water such as lakes, marshes or fish-ponds as breeding sites.|$|E
50|$|The winter plumage of the <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> is duskier {{than that}} of other grebes; its dark grey cap is less defined, and merges into the grey face, and a pale {{crescent}} that curves around {{the rear of the}} face contrasts {{with the rest of the}} head. The front of the neck is whitish or light grey, the hind neck is darker grey, and the yellow of the bill is less obvious than in summer. Although the <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> is unmistakable in breeding plumage, it is less distinctive in winter and can be confused with similar species. It is larger than the Slavonian (horned) grebe, with a relatively larger bill and a grey, rather than white face. It is closer in size to the Eurasian great crested grebe, but that species is longer-necked, has a more contrasting head pattern, and always shows white above the eye.|$|E
50|$|Local and scarce bird {{records for}} the area include: black-throated diver, <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe,</b> sooty shearwater, Balearic shearwater, Leach's storm-petrel, spoonbill, pink-footed goose, garganey, European honey buzzard, red grouse, dotterel, wood sandpiper, grey phalarope, pomarine skua, long-tailed skua, Sabine’s gull, ring-billed gull, yellow-legged gull, Iceland gull, roseate tern, black guillemot, little auk, long-eared owl, hoopoe, wryneck, waxwing, yellow-browed warbler, golden oriole, great grey shrike, twite and snow bunting.|$|E
50|$|Over 150 {{different}} {{bird species}} have been reported along the Los Angeles River, including, great egret, great blue heron, snowy egret, black-crowned night heron, red-tailed hawk, prairie falcon, osprey, northern mockingbird, western bluebird, common raven, American crow, double-crested cormorant, Canada goose, mallard, gadwall, Muscovy duck (introduced), horned grebe, <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe,</b> black-necked grebe, pied-billed grebe, American coot, cinnamon teal, western gull, mourning dove, killdeer, etc.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> has two subspecies, the {{nominate}} subspecies P. g. grisegena in Europe {{and western}} Asia, and P. g. holboelii (Holboell's grebe, named for Danish explorer of Greenlandic birds Carl Peter Holbøll) in North America and eastern Siberia. The east Asian birds have slightly smaller bills than the American form, although {{the differences are}} too small to merit separation as a third subspecies.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> {{is one of}} {{the species}} to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. Parties to the Agreement are {{required}} to engage {{in a wide range of}} conservation strategies which are describes in a detailed action plan. The plan is intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation, management of human activities, research, education, and implementation.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{endangered}} birds on these islands, including the Blakiston's fish owl, osprey, black stork, <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe,</b> gyrfalcon, solitary snipe, Steller's sea eagle and the Siberian grouse. In {{the spring and}} summer, a number of seabird species nest on the islands, including black-headed and slaty-backed gull, common and thick-billed murre, horned and tufted puffin, spectacled guillemot, Aleutian tern, long-billed murrelet, and pelagic cormorant.|$|E
50|$|Raudna Nature Reserve protects {{a former}} quarry, now a lake, which {{functions}} {{as an important}} resting-place for migratory birds, as well as feeding and breeding ground for them. On the little islands in the lake, birds like coot and <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> make their nests. Other species of protected birds often found in the area includes little ringed plover, common tern and Eurasian curlew. The flora includes different species of orchids.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> is {{a nondescript}} dusky-grey bird in winter. During the {{breeding}} season, it acquires the distinctive red neck plumage, black cap and contrasting pale grey face from which its name was derived. It {{also has an}} elaborate courtship display {{and a variety of}} loud mating calls. Once paired, it builds a nest from water plants on top of floating vegetation in a shallow lake or bog.|$|E
50|$|This is a mid-sized grebe, varying from 28-45 cm {{in overall}} length. It weighs up to 600 g. Its {{coloration}} is unmistakable. The only grebe species it somewhat resembles is the unrelated <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> {{which is not}} found in South America. The only congener, the white-tufted grebe, does not look very similar. The color pattern of the Titicaca grebe is altogether {{similar to that of}} the <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe,</b> but it has a darker belly, and a white (not light grey) throat patch that runs down the neck nearly to the breast. Due to the short wings, the rufous flanks can usually be seen. The ornamental plumes on the head are a vestigial version of those of the white-tufted grebe, but dark. Iris and the lower bill are yellow. Juveniles and non-breeding adults are duller, lack the ornamental plumes, and in the case of the former have rufous stripes on the sides of the head and more white on the neck, so that the rufous breast does not show in swimming birds.|$|E
50|$|Because of its {{favourable}} {{location on}} the migration path of migrating birds, Wallnau is a much sought-after resting place and is also used as a nesting ground in the summer by rare birds like the <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> and little tern.The nature reserve can be viewed at any time from a path {{on the crest of}} the summer dyke. NABU's information centre is open from March to October and there are also guided walks through the area.|$|E
50|$|Many {{common and}} rare birds {{can be seen}} here, {{including}} ash-throated and gray flycatchers, bald eagles, blue herons, pinyon jays, and peregrine falcons, {{as well as some}} rare breeds such as red-throated loon and <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe.</b> The best birding locations are the Colorado River, Colorado National Monument and Highline Lake State Park. The Grand Valley Audubon and the Colorado Birding Society are good sources of local information on birding. See also List of birds of Colorado.|$|E
50|$|Like other grebes, the <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> ingests large {{quantities}} of its own feathers, which remain in the bird's stomach. Feathers are not only swallowed by adults, mainly during self-preening, but are often fed to the young, sometimes within a day of hatching. These feathers soon decompose into a felt-like, amorphous mass. The function of the feathers in the stomach is unknown, {{although it has been}} suggested that they help to protect the lower digestive tract from bones and other hard, indigestible material.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> {{has a large}} range, {{estimated}} at 1-10 million square kilometres (0.4-3.8 million square miles), and a global population of 150,000-370,000 individuals, with P. g. holboellii about twice as numerous as the nominate race. The population trend has not been quantified, {{but it is not}} believed to meet the thresholds for the population decline criterion (declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations) of the IUCN Red List. For these reasons, the species is evaluated as Least Concern.|$|E
50|$|The {{conservation}} order aims {{to preserve}} and reinstate the sea region's function as a feeding, over-wintering, moulting, migration and rest area for the species living there, especially for red-throated loon (Gavia stellata), black-throated loon (Gavia arctica), horned grebe (Podiceps auritus), little gull (Larus minutus), common tern (Sterna hirundo), Arctic tern (Sterna paradisaea), <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> (Podiceps grisegena), long-tailed duck (Clangula hyernalis), scoter (Melanitta nigra), velvet scoter (Melanitta fusca), common gull (Larus canus), lesser black-backed gull (Larus fiscus), guillemot (Uria aalge), razorbill (Alca torda) and black guillemot (Cepphus grylle).|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to fish, the reservoir provide habitat {{for a wide}} variety of bird species. Birdwatchers can see waterfowl, songbirds, and birds of prey in the Gerber area. Common waterfowl include western grebe, <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe,</b> common loon, hooded merganser, common merganser, trumpeter swan, Canada goose, snow goose, black tern, American coot, and a number of duck species. Other water-dependent birds found at the reservoir include sandhill crane, great blue heron, black-crowned night heron, American bittern, snowy egret, American white pelican, American avocet, long-billed curlew, willet, Virginia rail, spotted sandpiper, and common snipe.|$|E
50|$|Moss Landing State Beach {{has several}} bird-watching spots, but {{the type and}} number of birds can vary by season. Moss Landing Wildlife Area, {{with access to the}} east of Highway 1, has ponds that are {{controlled}} by tidal gates. They are a major roost for brown pelicans and also beneficial for shorebirds. Sea ducks, loons, grebes and gulls can also be easily spotted. Occasionally, there are special visitors such as Long-tailed Duck and <b>Red-necked</b> <b>Grebe.</b> Endangered species, the California Sea Otter, can be observed in the harbor channel with sometimes dozens in a raft.|$|E
50|$|Breeding {{takes place}} in shallow {{freshwater}} lakes, bays of larger lakes, marshes, and other inland bodies of water, often less than 3 ha in extent and less than 2 m deep. The <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> shows a preference for waters in forested areas or, further north, in shrub tundra, and favours sites with abundant emergent vegetation, such as reedbeds. The best breeding habitat is fish-ponds, which have an abundance of food in addition to meeting the other requirements. The American subspecies is less tied to a high aquatic plant density, and sometimes breeds on quite open lakes.|$|E
50|$|Of {{the many}} birds in Maine, a small {{fraction}} of them are the bald eagle, peregrine falcon, great horned owl, barn owl, barred owl, long-eared owl, great gray owl, northern saw-whet owl, common nighthawk, whip-poor-will, chimney swift, common loon, pied-billed grebe, horned grebe, <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe,</b> northern fulmar, greater shearwater, sooty shearwater, manx shearwater, Wilson's storm-petrel, Leach's storm-petrel, piping plover, American pipit, Arctic tern, Atlantic puffin, black tern, harlequin duck, razorbill, black-capped chickadee, indigo bunting, scarlet tanager, mallard, wood duck, American black duck, Canada goose, American goldfinch, tufted titmouse, mourning dove, northern goshawk, golden eagle, sharp-shinned hawk, Cooper's hawk, northern harrier, and red-tailed hawk.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> flies {{with its}} long neck {{extended}} and its large feet trailing behind the body, which {{gives it a}} stretched-out appearance. The relatively small wings are grey with white secondaries, and beat very rapidly. Its small wing area means that the grebe is unable to take off from land, and needs a lengthy run across water to gain the speed needed for take-off. Like all grebes, the red-necked is an expert swimmer; it uses its feet for propulsion underwater, and steers by rotating its legs, since its tail is too short for this purpose.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> is a medium-large grebe, {{smaller than}} the great crested grebe of Eurasia, and the western and Clark's grebes of North America. The adult of the {{nominate}} European subspecies is 40 - 50 cm long with a 77 - 85 cm average wingspan, and weighs 692 - 925 g. In breeding plumage, it has a black cap that extends below the eye, very pale grey cheeks and throat, a rusty red neck, dark grey back and flanks, and white underparts. The eyes are dark brown and the long, pointed bill is black with a yellow base.|$|E
50|$|Carrick Roads and the Fal Estuary are favoured by ornithologists for birdwatching, {{especially}} the waders and waterbirds that visit in autumn and winter. The little egret and kingfisher {{can be seen}} all year while various passage waders pass through in spring, late summer and autumn. These include the whimbrel, the spotted redshank, the greenshank, the common sandpiper, the curlew sandpiper and the little stint. In the winter, the great northern diver and the black-throated diver can be seen, {{as well as the}} black-necked grebe, the <b>red-necked</b> <b>grebe</b> and the Slavonian grebe, the goldeneye and red-breasted merganser, and sometimes the long-tailed duck and the scoter.|$|E
