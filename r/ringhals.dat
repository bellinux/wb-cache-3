25|$|The first {{commercial}} {{nuclear power plant}} Oskarshamn 1 was commissioned in 1972 and was followed by another eleven units sited at Barsebäck, Oskarshamn <b>Ringhals</b> and Forsmark in the time period up to 1985. The twelve commercial reactors constructed in Sweden comprise 9 BWRs (ASEA-ATOM design) and 3 PWRs (Westinghouse design). In 2004, Studsvik Nuclear (an institute established in 1958 for the Swedish nuclear program with research reactors) decided to permanently shut down the two research reactors (R2 and R2–0) at the Studsvik site. They were closed in June 2005. “The decision was taken on economical grounds, the licenses had recently been extended until 2014, subject to certain conditions. The reactors were mainly used for commercial materials testing purposes, isotope production, neutron source for research purposes, medical applications and higher education. They are currently under decommissioning.” Foreign observers judged that Swedish nuclear capabilities reached a very advanced level and that, {{at the end of}} its nuclear program, Sweden was technically capable of building a nuclear weapon within a short time.|$|E

In early 1980, after the Three Mile Island meltdown in the United States, a referendum was held on the future use of nuclear power in Sweden. In late 1980, after a three-question referendum produced mixed results, the Swedish Parliament decided to phase out existing reactors by 2010. In 2010, the Swedish government opened up for construction of new nuclear reactors.

A report by the Swedish nuclear regulator said that [...] "the current overall level of protection against sabotage is insufficient". Although Swedish nuclear power plants have security guards, the police are responsible for emergency response. The report criticised the level of cooperation between nuclear site staff and police in the case of sabotage or attack.|$|E

50|$|Nuclear {{power in}} Sweden include Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant and <b>Ringhals</b> Nuclear Power Plant and Oskarshamn Nuclear Power Plant in total ten reactors. Swedish nuclear power {{is owned by}} the state company Vattenfall, Finnish Fortum and German E.ON. The {{competition}} authorities and OECD have criticized the joint ownership. Swedish people voted for phase-out of nuclear power plants on 23 March 1980. The outcome of the vote was that the nuclear reactors will be phased out at a feasible rate. In 1980 the Riksdag decided that nuclear energy would be phased out by 2010. Barsebäck 1 nuclear reactor was shut in 1999 and Barsebäck 2 in 2005. <b>Ringhals</b> Nuclear Power Plant reactors 3 and 4 are expected to remain in service until the 2040s.|$|E

50|$|Vattenfall (then called Kungliga Vattenfallsstyrelsen or Royal Waterfall Board) {{was founded}} in 1909 as a {{state-owned}} enterprise in Sweden. From its founding until the mid-1970s, Vattenfall's business was largely restricted to Sweden, {{with a focus on}} hydroelectric power generation. Only in 1974 did the company begin to build nuclear reactors in Sweden (the <b>Ringhals</b> 1 and 2 reactors), eventually owning seven of Sweden's 12 reactors. In 1992, Vattenfall was reformed as the limited liability company Vattenfall AB.|$|E
50|$|Six nuclear {{reactors}} began commercial {{service in the}} 1970s, another six through 1985, with one unit closed in 1999 and another in 2005. Nine of the reactors were designed by ASEA, three supplied by Westinghouse.Sweden has three operational nuclear power plants, with ten operational {{nuclear reactors}}, which produce about 35-40% of the country's electricity. The nation's largest power station, <b>Ringhals</b> Nuclear Power Plant, has four reactors and generates about 15 percent of Sweden's annual electricity consumption. The power plants in Forsmark and Oskarshamn each have three reactors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ringhals</b> is a Swedish {{nuclear power}} plant with 4 reactors, one boiling water reactor (R1) and three {{pressurized}} water reactors (R2, R3 and R4). It is situated on the Värö Peninsula (Swedish: Väröhalvön) in Varberg Municipality approximately 60 km south of Gothenburg. With a total power rating of 3560 MWe, {{it is the largest}} power plant in Sweden and generates 24 TWh of electricity a year, the equivalent of 20% of the electrical power usage of Sweden. It is owned 70% by Vattenfall and 30% by Uniper SE.|$|E
50|$|Some of Vattenfall's {{most notable}} power {{generation}} plants include the 110 MW Lillgrund Wind Farm {{off the coast}} of Malmö, Sweden, the world's largest offshore wind farm at Thanet, UK, the nuclear reactors Brunsbuttel Nuclear Power Plant (67% ownership), Krummel Nuclear Power Plant (50% ownership), Brokdorf Nuclear Power Plant (20% ownership) in Germany, and the Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant and <b>Ringhals</b> Nuclear Power Plant in Sweden. The nuclear power stations of Brunsbüttel and Krümmel have been shut down permanently in response to a governmental order in summer 2011 after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.|$|E
50|$|European windstorms {{wipe out}} {{electrical}} generation capacity across large areas, making supplementation from abroad difficult (windturbines {{shut down to}} avoid damage and nuclear capacity may shut if cooling water is contaminated or flooding of the power plant occurs). Transmission capabilities can also be severely limited if power lines are brought down by snow, ice or high winds. In the wake of Cyclone Gudrun in 2005 Denmark and Latvia had difficulty importing electricity, and Sweden lost 25% of its total power capacity as the <b>Ringhals</b> Nuclear Power Plant and Barsebäck nuclear power plant nuclear plants were shut down.|$|E
5000|$|In 1988 the Moderate Party {{proposed}} a national Carbon dioxide limit. Which meant that {{nuclear power plants}} could not be replaced by fossil fuel power plants. The same year the cabinet revised their nuclear proposition; now the first reactor was to be closed by 1995, and the second by 1996. The plants where reactors were to be closed were Barsebäck and <b>Ringhals.</b> Dahl declared that the decision was [...] "irreversible." [...] But after debates in parliament the Liberal People's Party and the Centre Party, together {{with members of the}} social democratic party, reverted the decision in 1991.|$|E

They were shuttered for economical reasons, one of which was high costs for safety upgrades and another lower electricity prices than expected. The competitive disadvantage for nuclear was partly a result of policy. The renewable portfolio standard (Elcertifikat) system was introduced in 2003 by a parliamentary majority including three anti-nuclear parties and the governing Social Democrats which {{was in the process of}} phasing out the Barsebäck power station. The Elcertifikat forced in successively more renewables in the electricity mix. As electricity consumption in Sweden dropped considerably from 2001 on, from about 150 to 140 TWh/year, nuclear power had to compete with subsidised wind power and for a shrinking market.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we have {{examined}} the Swedish nuclear power plant <b>Ringhals</b> by asking three questions: How does the search for legitimacy take shape at <b>Ringhals?,</b> What kinds of disciplining in Foucault’s terms can we find, and how do these affect the organization? and Which types of learning can we find at <b>Ringhals</b> {{and how do they}} learn from experiences? To answer these questions we have interviewed 24 employees, mainly about learning issues, but found indicators for legitimacy seeking and disciplining as well. The special characteristics of the nuclear power industry with its safety rules, authority control, terrorist threat, public fear, risk management and environmental issues, make it interesting to study. In line with our questions we have analyzed the material along three master tracks; new institutional theory, disciplining and organizational learning. We have been overloaded with ingredients, which we have tried to sort out, cook, package and serve in a delicious takeaway meal, provided in this thesis. We concluded that the search for legitimacy has many faces at <b>Ringhals.</b> Giving an old phenomenon a new costume brings attention to the issue and might speed up the change process, which always is slow due to inertia. We also found fractions of strong corporate culture (or brainwashing, depending on which mood you’re in), separation from the outside world, division of space and functional locations. Although <b>Ringhals</b> has a substantial learning toolbox, we have considered high reporting frequency as a crucial prerequisite for learning, which turned our interest to factors contributing to reporting.

The host community Bua is positive towards <b>Ringhals</b> and the changes it has brought. To some degree more so than results of prior studies with a higher than national average percent of study respondents being in favor of nuclear power. When <b>Ringhals</b> was established, Bua was small and had little power to impact the decision.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis has been to develop a tool for {{modelling}} and simulating the nuclear plant <b>Ringhals</b> 3. The model {{should be used to}} improve the knowledge on the dynamics of the plant. <b>Ringhals</b> 3 is being upgraded to produce more power and a tool for analyzing the new operating conditions is needed. The work in this thesis has consisted of improving and developing an existing model of <b>Ringhals</b> 3 made with the modelling tool Dymola. The model has been validated by comparing the results of a simulated house load transient with data from the actual plant. Validation shows good agreement with data from the real plant. However some differences in model and reality has been detected and has to be remembered when using the model for further analysis. After validation the input data of the model was updated for analyzing the new power level that will soon be implemented. The model was then used for simulating some interesting transients. The simulations show that <b>Ringhals</b> 3 with increased power production will most likely be able to perform a transition from full load to house load or one turbine load without causing a reactor trip even if the dump capacity is limited. If the dump capacity is entirely cut off a reactor trip would be actuated. Simulations also show that with new control settings the reactor can be run lower in coast down than what is made today and still manage a house load transient without tripping...|$|E

40|$|The Division of Subatomic Physics and Plasma Physics (formerly Division of Nuclear Engineering) in Chalmers, Göteborg, and the <b>Ringhals</b> Nuclear Plant have {{investigated}} the core barrel vibrations in the <b>Ringhals</b> PWRs over the last 20 years. Based on the different symmetry properties of the vibration modes, a mode separation technique was developed to enhance the contributions from the different modes. Recent observations of wear at both the lower and upper core-barrel-support structures in the <b>Ringhals</b> PWRs indicated that vibration modes of the core barrel other than pendular (beam mode) and shell mode are likely to occur. A beam mode type movement alone {{is not able to}} explain such a wear, and therefore, it is fair to assume that the vibration mode in question is a small amplitude periodic tilting movement of the core barrel around a horizontal, diagonal pivot at the half height of the core. In this work, ex-core data taken in the Ringhals- 4 PWR were analyzed in order to find evidence of such a tilting movement. First, cross spectra between various ex-core detectors were calculated and analyzed to locate the frequency range of the new vibrational mode. Then, a model based on symmetry considerations was derived in order to extract the sought mode from the spectra. The measurements were evaluated by the new mode enhancement technique. The results show {{that it is possible to}} enhance such a mode and find it in the spectra by properly combining the signals in the time domain...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, the {{enthalpy}} raise {{hot channel}} factor limit has decreased significantly {{due to the}} power upgrade of <b>Ringhals</b> 4 {{and the use of}} shielding fuel assemblies. The shielding fuel assemblies task are to reduce the neutron leakage to the reactor vessel and in that way extend the reactor lifetime. This is achieved by replacing a few fuel rods with steel rods. Experiences from the last fuel cycles show that the core design procedure has been hampered because of this and that it’s hard to stay under the design limit. A way to overcome this problem and to improve the fuel economy is to introduce the use of radial enrichment distribution in the fuel assembly. This master thesis shows, through a case study of three fuel cycles at <b>Ringhals</b> 4,  that the internal peaking factor can be improved by roughly 2 – 3 % and that the maximum enthalpy raise hot channel factor can be improved by about 2. 0 – 2. 5 % if the fuel assemblies contain three different levels of enrichments instead of currently one. This can be achieved without any noticeable decrease in cycle length. Genom en fallstudie av tre driftcykler för <b>Ringhals</b> 4 visar den här rapporten att max FΔH under cykeln kan sänkas med 2, 0 – 2, 5 % om bränsleknippena radiellt anrikningsoptimeras med minst tre delanrikningar.

The two industries use water in their processes and have long been associated with releases of different substances, such as PCBs, and other chlorinated compounds. The environmental impact by the two industries {{is believed to be}} significant. The aim of the project was to examine the sediments close to both the water intake and water output to determine if these industrial activities have in any way changed the composition of the sediments. The sediments were extracted by Soxhlet extraction, followed by a deactivated silica and an acidic silica clean-up and then analysed by using a gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer, (GC-MS) with electron ionization, EI+, mode used in full scan mode. Each mass spectra were analysed by comparing them to the NIST database from 1998. The results were inconclusive since the peaks were not properly resolved, causing a poor correlation to the NIST database. One batch was specifically analysed for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) by using an atmospheric pressure gas chromatograph (APGC) coupled to a mass spectrometer (MS). The PCB analysis provided accurate results, except for the <b>Ringhals</b> intake where the MS became saturated due to the high levels. The river Viskan also showed high levels of PCB. The congener pattern from PCBs found near <b>Ringhals</b> intake resembled an Aroclor pattern from Aroclor 1248.

The reload scheme and the operating parameters are modelled on the Swedish PWR <b>Ringhals</b> 3 and a normal UOX fuel assembly designed for this reactor {{has been used as a}} reference. Results show that an extension of the currently employed 12 -month oper- ating cycle length is possible, either with a burnable absorber or with a modified fuel assembly design, assuming the same 3 -batch reload scheme as currently used in <b>Ringhals</b> 3. The initial k∞ of the new Th-MOX fuel design was designed not to exceed that of the refer- ence UOX fuel. The power peaking factor is initially significantly lower than the reference, but slightly higher later in the life of the fuel assembly. All reactivity coefficients are within acceptable range.
