5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, {{improvements}} in <b>regional</b> <b>transport</b> infrastructure precipitated {{the decline of}} Salford's existing industries, including those at the Salford Docks. Increased foreign competition began to undermine the competitiveness of local textile processing businesses. Rising unemployment during the Great Depression of the 1920s and '30s, and a significant economic decline in the decades following the Second World War contributed toward a fall in Salford's population. By 1939 local coal mining had almost stopped, and cotton spinning had by 1971 ceased completely. Between 1921 and 1939, the population of Salford decreased by 29%, from 234,045 to 166,386, far greater than the rate of decline within the whole of North West England.|$|E
40|$|<b>Regional</b> <b>transports</b> are {{designed}} to operate on air networks having the basic characteristics of short trip distances and low density passengers/cargo, i. e. small numbers of passengers per flight. <b>Regional</b> <b>transports</b> passenger capacity is from 10 to 100 seats and operate on routes from 350 to 1000 nautical miles (nm). An air network operated by <b>regional</b> <b>transports</b> has the following characteristics: (1) connecting regional centers; (2) operating on low density passengers/cargo flow services with minimum two frequencies per day; (3) operating on high density passengers/cargo flow with more than two frequencies per day; and (4) operating supplemental services whenever market demands {{in order to help}} bigger capacity aircraft already operating the same routes. In order to meet passenger requirements providing low fares and high or required number of frequencies, airlines must constantly monitor operational costs and keep them low. It is obvious that costs of operating aircraft must be lower than yield obtained by transporting passengers and cargo. The requirement to achieve favorable yield/cost ratio must provide {{the answer to the question}} of which aircraft will best meet a specific air network. An air network is defined by the number of services, the trip distance of each service, and the number of flights (frequencies) per day and week...|$|R

40|$|Of all the network-bound {{sectors of}} the economy, it is public short-distance and <b>regional</b> {{passenger}} <b>transport</b> which gets the worst ratings {{in the view of}} European consumers. Satisfaction is markedly better with regard to markets that have already been liberalised, such as telecoms, electricity utilities and air traffic. For Austrian public short-distance and <b>regional</b> passenger <b>transport,</b> customer satisfaction is still relatively high compared to international levels. And taking the modal split as a basis, public carriers still carry considerable weight (when seen against international rates), transporting, as they do, more than 40 percent of passengers in the Vienna area. Nevertheless, over the past years public short-distance and <b>regional</b> passenger <b>transport</b> has lost substantial ground to private motorised traffic. In spite of heavy subsidising, especially of the rail, shifts to public passenger transport, an objective that is desirable in both traffic and environmental terms, have been minor at best. The attractiveness of public short-distance and <b>regional</b> passenger <b>transport</b> depends not just on its funding but also on the incentives in connection with its structure and financing. At present, public short-distance and <b>regional</b> passenger <b>transport</b> costs some € 2 billion per year. Of this sum, two thirds are financed from public funds, much of it from the federal government, which has provided a financing guarantee of € 800 million p. a. for another decade. The restructuring and regionalisation effort started in 1999 will certainly improve cost awareness, but it still provides no sufficient basis to ensure the efficient use of funds in public short-distance and <b>regional</b> passenger <b>transport.</b> In addition to regionalising order processes and awarding greater financial responsibility to the ordering agencies, an important step to improve financial efficiency is tendering. Numerous international models have established that efficient tendering can substantially reduce the level of subsidies while maintaining the quality of service in public short-distance and <b>regional</b> passenger <b>transport.</b> The funds thus saved could be used to add to the service and improve the attractiveness of public passenger transport vis-à-vis private traffic. However, the statutory prerequisites to ensure effective tendering have not yet been introduced in Austria. The definition of profitability of public enterprises, which is very wide at present, screens large parts of the transport services from competitive tendering, and within the boundaries of profitability there are few incentives to improve cost efficiency. A further impediment to fair and non-discriminatory competitive tendering is raised by the organisational framework specified in the Act governing public short-distance and <b>regional</b> passenger <b>transport.</b> Liberalisierung; Öffentlicher Personenverkehr; Kontrollierter Wettbewerb; Internationaler Vergleich; Österreich; Wettbewerb im öffentlichen Personennah- und -regionalverkehr; Competition in Public Short-distance and <b>Regional</b> Passenger <b>Transport...</b>|$|R
