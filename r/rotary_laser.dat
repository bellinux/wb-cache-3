50|$|In physics, in engineering, and in construction, the {{direction}} designated as vertical is usually that along which a plumb-bob hangs. Alternatively, a spirit level that exploits the buoyancy {{of an air}} bubble and its tendency to go vertically upwards {{may be used to}} test for horizontality.

50|$|A <b>rotary</b> <b>laser</b> {{level is}} a more {{advanced}} laser level in that it spins the beam of light fast enough to give {{the effect of a}} complete 360 degree horizontal or vertical plane, thus illuminating not just a fixed line, but a horizontal plane. The laser beam projector employs a rotating head with a mirror for sweeping the laser beam about a vertical axis. If the mirror is not self-leveling, it is provided with visually readable level vials and manually adjustable screws for orienting the projector. A staff carried by the operator is equipped with a movable sensor, which can detect the laser beam and gives a signal when the sensor is in line with the beam (usually an audible beep). The position of the sensor on the graduated staff, also known as a grade rod, or story pole, allows comparison of elevations between different points on the terrain. Most laser levels are used in the construction industry.|$|E

40|$|As {{the time}} scales {{associated}} with stimulated emission and heat flow are very different, the motion {{provided by the}} periscope effectively separates the optical and thermal processes in space. This {{is similar to the}} approach taken by quasi-CW lasers, which separates the two processes in time, and thus allows the RCL to provide a CW output whilst maintaining the thermal management ability of a quasi-CW laser. Using motion for thermal management imparts a number of advantages, for example the potential to utilise high pump densities and thus smaller pumped regions than those found in thin disk lasers. Energy stored in the gain medium is therefore less susceptible to extraction via ASE, allowing the generation of high energy pulses at high repetition rates. Furthermore, this approach provides a simplified heat sinking arrangement when compared to other motion based thermal management techniques, such as the <b>Rotary</b> Disk <b>Laser</b> which depends on a moving gain medium. We will be presenting the latest performance results for our RCL with CW power levels exceeding 100 W from a single "end-pumped" Nd:YAG polycrystalline sample...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA novel <b>rotary</b> <b>laser</b> dieless {{drawing process}} for metal microtube with local heating using a laser {{irradiated}} from one direction is proposed. A metal microtube is rotated about a tensile axis by rotary stage with chucks for circumferential uniform temperature distribution. A tube {{of stainless steel}} SUS 304 with an outer diameter of 0. 5 mm and thickness of 0. 13 mm {{is used in the}} experiments. The rotating effects on outer diameter variation and outer radius error are evaluated in laser dieless drawing. As a result, the outer diameter variation under a condition of non-rotation is higher than that under condition of rotation. Thus, the limit of stable drawing condition can be enhanced by rotating effect in laser dieless drawing. In addition, in case of laser heating irradiated from one direction under non-rotating, the deformation amount of irradiated side is larger than that of non-irradiated side in laser dieless drawing. Meanwhile, the microtube is drawn subequally under condition of rotation due to circumferential uniform temperature distribution. Thus, the distorted radial deformation can be restrained by rotating effect. From these results, the effectiveness of the proposed <b>rotary</b> <b>laser</b> dieless drawing for fabricating metal microtubes can be demonstrated experimentally...|$|E

The laser beam is directed on reflecting elements (4, 6) gradually or in a predefinable order. The reflecting element is arranged and/or aligned so that the reflected laser beam reaches {{on the surface of}} the target at different positions.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The optical {{arrangement for}} forming coatings on a substrate by a plasma formation within a vacuum chamber, comprises a pulsed laser beam (5) directed for the ignition of electrical arc discharges on a surface of a cylindrical target (10), which rotates around a rotation axis. The laser beam is directed on reflecting elements (4, 6) gradually or in a predefinable order. The reflecting element is arranged and/or aligned so that the reflected laser beam reaches {{on the surface of the}} target at different positions. An orifice plate (1) is arranged between a window element (9) and the target within the vacuum chamber and is equipped with openings in the actual planes, through which the pulsed laser beam is directed on the target and the orifice plate is synchronously movable relative to the target with the arrangement. The laser beam reflected from the reflecting element is directed to a plane focused on the surface of the target by an optical element (3) arranged in the plane. The arrangement with the reflecting element and the surface of the target are oscillatingly movable relative to each other between two charge-over points along an axis or in two axes standing vertical to each other and parallel to the surface of the target. The arrangement is arranged outside of the vacuum chamber. The openings at the orifice plate are formed as inner hollow element in channel-form. Two orifice plates are provided, which are directed parallel to each other and arranged in a distance one after another in relation to the reflected laser beam. The reflecting element in the optical planes is arranged in a plane vertical to a swivel axis of a tiltable reflecting element. The pulsed laser beam reaches gradually or with the predefinable order on the reflecting element of the individual optical plane by the tiltable reflecting element. The reflecting element is arranged radially outside to a cylindrical carrier rotating parallel to the rotation axis of the target. The cylindrical carrier is present in the respective planes and in the movable arrangement. The release of the laser impulses is synchronized with the position of the reflecting elements movably arranged to each other. The laser beam hits the reflecting element directed parallel to the rotation axis of the carrier. The laser beam is directed by different reflecting elements rotating around an axis. The laser beam is directed by through-openings during the rotation of the reflecting elements, which are fixedly arranged beneath by through-openings on plate-shaped elements, and the rotation of the reflecting element on the target fixedly arranged in the planes. The through-openings are formed as carrier in the plate-shaped elements. The rotation axis of the reflecting element is directed parallel to the rotation axis of the cylindrical shaped target. The two reflecting elements are arranged on the plate-shaped elements. The reflecting element is arranged in relation to through-openings in the optical axis of the <b>rotary</b> <b>laser</b> beam. A further reflecting element is present on each plate-shaped elements. The rotary reflecting elements are fastened to another carrier. The positions, at which the laser beam hits the surface of the target, have same distances. During the relative motion of arrangement with reflecting elements and target, a path, which put back between the charge-over points, is so large as the distance of the adjacent positions. The reflecting elements are concavely curved, so that the laser beam is focused in the direction of the target. USE - Optical arrangement for forming coatings on a substrate by a plasma formation within a vacuum chamber. ADVANTAGE - The optical arrangement is capable of economically, uniformly and effectively forming the coatings on the substrate surfaces with less maintenance cost in less-time consuming manner, and completely avoids an undesirable coating of window element in the interior of vacuum chamber...|$|E

25|$|Traditional {{spark plugs}} {{need to be}} {{indented}} into {{the walls of the}} combustion chamber to enable the apex of the rotor to sweep past. As the rotor's apex seals pass over the spark plug hole, a small amount of compressed charge can be lost from the charge chamber to the exhaust chamber, entailing fuel in the exhaust, reducing efficiency, and resulting in higher emissions. These points may be overcome by using laser ignition, eliminating traditional spark plugs and removing the narrow slit in the motor housing so the rotor apex seals can fully sweep with no loss of compression from adjacent chambers. This concept has a precedent in the glow plug used by Toyota (SAE paper 790435), and the SAE paper 930680, by D. Hixon et al., on 'Catalytic Glow Plugs in the JDTI Stratified Charge <b>Rotary</b> Engine'. The <b>laser</b> plug can fire its spark through the narrow slit. Laser spark plugs can also fire deep into the combustion chamber using multiple sparks. Direct fuel injection, to which the Wankel engine is suited, combined with laser ignition in single or multiple laser plugs, has been shown to enhance the motor even further reducing the disadvantages.|$|R
40|$|Usually, {{each phase}} of the direct {{reluctance}} motor is fed separately by its own inverter producing a squarewave phase current depending on the rotor position. In the present work, a star-connection of the three stator phases is used and the direct reluctance motor is fed by a three-phase switched inverter. The space phasor theory shows that three-phase sinewave currents can produce a constant electromagnetic torque. In this case, the rotating reference frame rotates at half of the rotor speed and in the opposite direction. This command strategy allows to reduce the stator deformation due to the electromagnetic radial force which is very high {{in this type of}} motor and which is mainly responsible for the acoustic noise. The electromagnetic torque control is realised by a sliding mode control of the three phase currents. In the rotating reference frame, it is possible to show that the eight commutation states of the switched inverter are placed around an ellipse in the complex plane of the derivatives of the space phasor of the phase current. A study of this ellipse has allowed to determine the maximal torque {{as a function of the}} speed for a given continuous voltage. It is important to insure that the torque reference will never exceed this limitation in order to avoid a pullout phenomenon, highly unwanted in the speed control. Despite the fact that the resolver inside the casing of the direct reluctance motor produces a small periodic error, it is accurate enough for the position measurement and to produce the three current references. However, the derivative of the position measurement provides a speed evaluation with such a ripple that the speed control cannot be outstanding. So, for the speed measurement, an additional <b>laser</b> <b>rotary</b> encoder is used. The experimental study in the steady-state mode of the speed control shows the presence of an electromagnetic torque ripple. This is a residual ripple caused by the dissimilarity between the stator poles teeth-shapes and the magnetic saturation effect. Although this torque ripple is rather low compared with the usual command strategy, two methods are proposed in order to compensate it. The first method is based on the use of a correction factor depending on the tooth angle. First, in steady-state conditions, the correction factor is stored off-line in a table. Then it is used in-line as a feedforward disturbance compensation. The second method of reducing the residual torque ripple consists in implementing an observer of variable disturbance. This is a disturbance observer able to determine the frequency content of the torque ripple. For instance, in order to observe the continuous component, the fundamental wave as well as the harmonics 2, 3, and 6, the observer must have ten poles. The main difficulty to deal with such an observer is the fact that each pole moves quickly as a function of the motor speed. So, in order to guarantee the observer stability over a large range of speed, the poles are located dynamically regarding to the motor speed by the way of a discontinuous adaptation of the feedforward coefficients. The theoretical study and the numerical simulation have allowed to formulate some criteria about the way of locating the poles. Experimental results confirm the efficiency of the observer of variable disturbance in order to reduce the electromagnetic torque ripple...|$|R
