There {{is evidence of}} an earlier nave at its west side indicated by a lower <b>roof</b> <b>pitch</b> line. Rood doors survive, the rood screen being early 16th-century, with 1948 restoration. The pulpit and lectern is 19th-century, and the octagonal font, 17th.|$|E
50|$|Five more {{bungalows}} have side gables. Three are on Linden Street, {{and there}} is one each on High and 28th Streets. Three houses feature a subtype of this style has a single <b>roof</b> <b>pitch</b> and full width front porch. Two more houses have a single <b>roof</b> <b>pitch,</b> offset with a less than full width front porch. There is also one house that has a double main <b>roof</b> <b>pitch.</b> It also has a combination of American Craftsman and Classical Revival ornamentation.|$|E
50|$|Boatsheds are {{typically}} around 6.2 m long × 3.0 m wide × 2.4 m high, which is somewhat larger than local bathing boxes (typically only 2.4 m long × 2.0 m wide × 2.0 m high). Boatsheds have a <b>roof</b> <b>pitch</b> of around 30°, which is somewhat shallower than the 35° <b>roof</b> <b>pitch</b> of local bathing boxes.|$|E

The case was taken in atrium building with 4 types of <b>roof</b> i. e. <b>pitched</b> <b>roof,</b> barrel vault <b>roof,</b> monitor <b>pitched</b> <b>roof</b> (both monitor <b>pitched</b> <b>roof</b> and monitor barrel vault roof), and north light roof (both with north orientation and south orientation). The results show that both methods have agreement and disagreement. They show {{the same pattern of}} daylight distribution. In the other side, in terms of daylight factors, computer simulation tends to underestimate calculation compared to physical model measurement, while for average and minimum illumination, it tends to overestimate the calculation...|$|R
50|$|The second name, gabled rhombohedron, is from Michael Goldberg's {{paper on}} space-filling octahedra, model 8-VI, the 6th {{of at least}} 49 space-filling octahedra. A gable is the {{triangular}} portion of a wall between the edges of intersecting <b>roof</b> <b>pitches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In addition, VELUX {{offers many}} types of {{decoration}} and sun screening, roller shutters, installation products, products for remote control and thermal solar panels for installation in roofs. Velux windows can be installed on both flat <b>roof</b> and <b>pitched</b> <b>roof</b> windows. (Anything between a 5-15° pitch will require a flat roof window and above this, a <b>pitched</b> <b>roof</b> window will be needed).|$|R

50|$|Historically <b>roof</b> <b>pitch</b> was {{designated}} {{in two other}} ways: A ratio of the ridge height to {{the width of the}} building (span) and as a ratio of the rafter length to the width of the building.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} imbrex and tegula <b>roofing</b> in <b>pitched</b> <b>roof</b> {{construction}} {{is still in}} use today as an international feature of style and design, and is {{the origin of the}} term [...] for the condition of things arranged in overlapping layers.|$|R
50|$|The grades or {{slopes of}} {{existing}} physical {{features such as}} canyons and hillsides, stream and river banks and beds are often described. Grades are typically specified for new linear constructions (such as roads, landscape grading, <b>roof</b> <b>pitches,</b> railroads, aqueducts, and pedestrian or bicycle circulation routes). The grade may refer to the longitudinal slope or the perpendicular cross slope.|$|R

50|$|Flagstone {{shingles}} are {{a traditional}} roofing material. Some stone shingles are fastened in place but some simply {{are held by}} gravity so the <b>roof</b> <b>pitch</b> cannot be too steep or the stones will slide off the roof. Sandstone has also been used to make shingles.|$|E
50|$|There are many, in {{the design}} professions, who have been {{critical}} of ResCode for its conservative interpretations of neighbourhood character. Many architects regard the degree to which its constraints on aspects of architectural design such as height, <b>roof</b> <b>pitch,</b> materials, fences, and window details limit innovations in design.|$|E
50|$|The Spanish {{generally}} {{follow the}} Mediterranean forms of architecture with stone walls and shallow <b>roof</b> <b>pitch.</b> Timber framing is often {{of the post}} and lintel style. Castile and León and the Basque Country have the most representative examples {{of the use of}} timber framing in the Iberian Peninsula.|$|E
50|$|A gable is the {{generally}} triangular {{portion of a}} wall between the edges of intersecting <b>roof</b> <b>pitches.</b> The shape of the gable {{and how it is}} detailed depends on the structural system used, which reflects climate, material availability, and aesthetic concerns. A gable wall or gable end more commonly refers to the entire wall, including the gable and the wall below it.|$|R
50|$|Elevations are a non-perspective {{view of the}} home. These {{are drawn}} to scale so that {{measurements}} can be taken for any aspect necessary. Plans include front, rear and both side elevations. The elevations specify ridge heights, the positioning of the final fall of the land, exterior finishes, <b>roof</b> <b>pitches</b> and other details {{that are necessary to}} give the home its exterior architectural styling.|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} distinction is between <b>pitched</b> green <b>roofs</b> and flat green <b>roofs.</b> <b>Pitched</b> sod <b>roofs,</b> a traditional feature of many Scandinavian buildings, {{tend to be}} of a simpler design than flat green roofs. This is because the <b>pitch</b> of the <b>roof</b> {{reduces the risk of}} water penetrating through the roof structure, allowing the use of fewer waterproofing and drainage layers.|$|R
5000|$|Asphalt {{roll roofing}} or {{membrane}} is a roofing material commonly used for buildings that feature a low sloped <b>roof</b> <b>pitch</b> in North America. The material {{is based on}} the same materials used in asphalt shingles; an organic felt or fiberglass mat, saturated with asphalt, and faced with granular stone aggregate.|$|E
50|$|Wilhelm Grebe {{was one of}} Adolf Hitler's architects. Grebe {{noted that}} {{there were at least}} seventy {{different}} types of indigenous architecture in Nazi Germany and argued that in the future standardization throughout Germany might be necessary. The project never went ahead. Grebe also argued that the ideal <b>roof</b> <b>pitch</b> should be increased from 45 to 48 degrees.|$|E
50|$|The south {{elevation}} {{reflects the}} additions {{that have occurred}} over time. These are illustrated in changes of <b>roof</b> <b>pitch,</b> joint lines in the chamferboard and various window types. The masonry section has a painted render finish with side-hung casement windows. There is a single flight, steel and timber stair leading to the first floor. The remaining walls reflect several additions.|$|E
40|$|Wind {{tunnel model}} studies {{were carried out}} to {{determine}} the external wind pressure distributions on large, low-rise buildings with <b>roof</b> <b>pitches</b> of 15 degrees and 35 degrees. The studies showed {{a significant increase in the}} magnitude of the mean and peak negative pressure coefficients with an increase in length to span aspect ratio, on the downwind roof and leeward wall, near the windward gable-end of building with a steep 35 degrees <b>pitch</b> <b>roof,</b> for oblique approach winds. These oblique approach winds also generate large design wind load effects on the frames near the gable-end. There is little variation in mean and peak pressure coefficients with aspect ratio, across the frame of the building with a moderate 15 degrees <b>pitch</b> <b>roof.</b> AS/NZS 1170. 2, which specifies increased suction pressures with aspect ratio on the downwind roof slope and leeward wall of steep <b>pitch</b> <b>roof</b> buildings compared to the previous edition of the standard, provides satisfactory design wind load effects on frames near gable-end. However, some design load effects on frames near the gable-end of the 15 degrees <b>pitch</b> <b>roof</b> building are underestimated by AS/NZS 1170. 2...|$|R

50|$|The station complex {{consists}} of a station building, an office building, and a restaurant {{adjacent to each other}} along the rail line. They have a uniform <b>roof</b> <b>pitch,</b> and form an atypical layout for a railway station. The low-pitched roof and deep overhanging eaves are indicative of Prairie School design influence. Two of the buildings were designed in 1904 by the Detroit firm Spier & Rohns.|$|E
5000|$|Shed dormer: This dormer {{also has}} a single flat plane roof, {{but in this case}} it is sloped in the same {{direction}} as the principal roof only at a shallower angle. A shed dormer can provide head room over a larger area than a gabled dormer, but as its <b>roof</b> <b>pitch</b> is shallower than the main roof it may require a different roof covering.|$|E
50|$|In the 15th century a large west {{window of}} nine main lights {{and a deep}} traced head was {{commissioned}} by John of Wheathampstead. The spire {{was reduced to a}} 'Hertfordshire spike', the <b>roof</b> <b>pitch</b> greatly reduced and battlements liberally added. Further new windows, at £50 each, were put in the transepts by Abbot Wallingford (also known as William of Wallingford), who also had a new high altar screen made.|$|E

50|$|The {{construction}} of a roof is determined by its method of support and how the underneath space is bridged {{and whether or not}} the <b>roof</b> is <b>pitched.</b> The pitch is the angle at which the roof rises from its lowest to highest point. Most US domestic architecture, except in very dry regions, has roofs that are sloped, or pitched. Although modern construction elements such as drainpipes may remove the need for <b>pitch,</b> <b>roofs</b> are <b>pitched</b> for reasons of tradition and aesthetics. So the pitch is partly dependent upon stylistic factors, and partially to do with practicalities.|$|R
