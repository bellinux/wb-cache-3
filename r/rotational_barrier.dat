25|$|An {{instance}} where hyperconjugation may {{be overlooked}} {{as a possible}} chemical explanation is in rationalizing the <b>rotational</b> <b>barrier</b> of ethane. It had been accepted {{as early as the}} 1930s that the staggered conformations of ethane were more stable than the eclipsed conformation. Wilson had proven that the energy barrier between any pair of eclipsed and staggered conformations is approximately 3 kcal/mol, and the generally accepted rationale for this was the unfavorable steric interactions between hydrogen atoms.|$|E
40|$|<b>Rotational</b> <b>barriers</b> of vinylidene ligands in the five-coordinate {{complexes}} M(X) Cl(=C=CHR) L- 2 (M = Os, Ru; L = phosphine) {{have been}} investigated by density functional theory calculations {{at the level of}} B 3 LYP. The effects of ligand X, transition metal M, and substituent R on the barriers have been examined. The results show that the <b>rotational</b> <b>barriers</b> increase with X from having pi -acceptor, sigma -donor to having pi -donor properties. Ligands (X) with pi -acceptor properties stabilize the transition state structures through interactions with the d orbital used for metal-vinylidene pi bonding in the most stable conformations and, therefore, give smaller <b>rotational</b> <b>barriers.</b> Studies of the influence of different substituents R show that the <b>rotational</b> <b>barriers</b> also increase with the electron donation abilities of R. The <b>rotational</b> <b>barriers</b> for Os complexes are generally higher in comparison to those of the Ru analogues. This result is related to the stronger osmium-ligand interactions because of the more diffuse d orbitals of the heavier metal...|$|R

25|$|Calixarenes are characterised by a {{three-dimensional}} basket, cup or bucket shape. In calixarenes the internal volume is around 10 cubic angstroms. Calixarenes are characterised {{by a wide}} upper rim and a narrow lower rim and a central annulus. With phenol as a starting material the 4 hydroxyl groups are intrannular on the lower rim. In a resorcinarene 8 hydroxyl groups are placed extraannular on the upper ring. Calixarenes exist in different chemical conformations because rotation around the methylene bridge is not difficult. In calixarene 4 up-down conformations exist: cone (point group C2v,C4v), partial cone Cs, 1,2 alternate C2h and 1,3 alternate D2d. The 4 hydroxyl groups interact by hydrogen bonding and stabilize the cone conformation. This conformation is in dynamic equilibrium with the other conformations. Conformations can be locked in place with proper substituents replacing the hydroxyl groups which increase the <b>rotational</b> <b>barrier.</b> Alternatively placing a bulky substituent on the upper rim also locks a conformation. The calixarene based on p-tert-butyl phenol is also a cone. Calixarenes are structurally related to the pillararenes.|$|E

[...] Hyperconjugation is proposed by quantum mechanical modeling to be the correct explanation for the preference of the staggered conformation rather than the old textbook notion of steric hindrance.|$|E
2500|$|Hyperconjugation {{can also}} explain several other {{phenomena}} whose explanations may also {{not be as}} intuitive as that for the <b>rotational</b> <b>barrier</b> of ethane. [...] One such example is the explanations for certain Lewis structures. [...] The Lewis structure for an ammonium ion indicates a positive charge on the nitrogen atom. In reality, however, the hydrogens are more electropositive than is nitrogen, and thus are the actual carriers of the positive charge. We know this intuitively because bases remove the protons {{as opposed to the}} nitrogen atom.|$|E
2500|$|Ethane gives a classic, simple {{example of}} such a <b>rotational</b> <b>barrier,</b> {{sometimes}} called the [...] "ethane barrier." [...] Among the earliest experimental evidence of this barrier (see diagram at left) was obtained by modelling the entropy of ethane. The three hydrogens at each end are free to pinwheel about the central carbon-carbon bond when provided with sufficient energy to overcome the barrier. The physical origin of the barrier is still not completely settled, although the overlap (exchange) repulsion between the hydrogen atoms on opposing ends of the molecule is perhaps the strongest candidate, with the stabilizing effect of hyperconjugation on the staggered conformation contributing to the phenomenon. However, theoretical methods that use an appropriate starting point (orthogonal orbitals) find that hyperconjugation is {{the most important factor in}} the origin of the ethane rotation barrier.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} a {{crystalline}} rotor that undergoes a reversible phase transition at 145 K. Variable-temperature X-ray and  1 H spin −lattice relaxation experiments, and calculations of <b>rotational</b> <b>barriers,</b> provide a description (i) {{of the way in}} which the rotators’ dynamics changes back and forth at the onset of the phase transition and (ii) of the mechanism responsible for the abrupt switching of the crystalline rotors from a very low-energy 4 -fold degenerate equilibrium state, in which the rotation is ultrafast (9. 6 GHz at  145 K), to a single higher-energy state associated with a slower motion (2. 3 GHz at 145 K). Our results provide evidence that the reversible change observed in the <b>rotational</b> <b>barriers</b> at the transition is due to a cooperative modulation of the C −Hrotator···Istator hydrogen bond cloud across a C −I stator···Istator−C halogen bond-mediated phase transition. In addition, we report evidence for second-harmonic generation from this material, thereby confirming with a second example the benefit of using polarized light to probe the torsional degree of freedom of chiral helix blades, as well as symmetry and dimensionality of large collections of chiral rotors in the solid state. ...|$|R

40|$|The NAD+/NADH {{coenzyme}} {{is involved}} in many enzyme-catalysed oxidation-reduction reactions. In order to obtain better insight in the catalytic mechanism of NAD+/NADH dependent dehydrogenases, conformational studies of 1, 3 -substituted pyridines and benzenes were carried out, using ab initio, semiempirical (AM 1 and PM 3) and force-field (AMBER 4. 0, CVFF and CHARMm 21. 3) methods.

Since biological activity may be related to acidity, a range of chromone- 2 -carboxylic acids have been prepared via Claisen acylation of substituted 0 -hydroxyacetophenones and their acid dissociation constants determined potentiometrically to explore substituent effects.
