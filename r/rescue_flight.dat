5|$|STS-300 was the {{designation}} for the Space Shuttle Launch on Need (LON) missions {{to be launched}} on short notice for STS-114 and STS-121, {{in the event that}} the shuttle became disabled or damaged and could not safely return to Earth. The <b>rescue</b> <b>flight</b> for STS-115, if needed, would have been STS-301. After STS-115, the rescue mission designations were based on the corresponding regular mission that would be replaced should the rescue mission be needed. For example, the STS-116 rescue mission was branded STS-317, because the normal mission scheduled after STS-116 was STS-117. Should the rescue mission have been needed, the crew and vehicle for STS-117 would assume the rescue mission profile and become STS-317. All potential rescue missions were to be launched with a crew of four, and would return with ten or eleven crew members, depending on the number of crew launched on the rescued shuttle. Missions were expected to last approximately eleven days. None of the planned contingency missions was ever flown.|$|E
25|$|The {{squadron}} {{was originally}} {{scheduled to be}} disbanded on 10 June 1945, but {{it was decided to}} maintain it. Some personnel were posted to No. 114 Air-Sea <b>Rescue</b> <b>Flight,</b> however. During June the squadron continued to fly a daily service to Madang, a bi-weekly service to Brisbane and occasional flights to Merauke and Darwin. No. 41 Squadron was officially disbanded on 27 September 1945.|$|E
25|$|Following the Chernobyl {{disaster}} in 1986, Schneerson called for efforts to rescue Ukrainian Jewish children from Chernobyl and founded a special organization for this purpose. The first <b>rescue</b> <b>flight</b> occurred on August 3, 1990, when 196 Jewish children were flown to Israel {{and brought to}} a shelter campus. Since then, thousands of children have been rescued and brought to Israel, where they receive housing, education and medical care in a supportive environment.|$|E

25|$|Endeavour was {{originally}} moved to launch pad 39B {{ahead of the}} normal schedule to be on standby as the Launch on Need (LON) flight for STS-125. In the event that something happened to Atlantis during its flight to service the Hubble Space Telescope, a <b>rescue</b> <b>flight</b> could be performed with Endeavour. With both Atlantis and Endeavour on the pads, it was the 18th time that two flight-ready orbiters were in position at both launch pads at the same time.|$|E
25|$|On 1 September 1959, as a {{response}} to a campaign of attacks by the IRA, a detached Search and <b>rescue</b> <b>flight</b> of No. 228 Squadron at RAF Aldergrove equipped with three Bristol Sycamore helicopters was re-designated 118 Squadron on 1 September 1959. It flew its Sycamores in support of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), carrying out short range transport and reconnaissance missions. Other duties of the squadron included experiments in traffic control. On 31 August 1962, with the threat from the IRA ended by a ceasefire, the Squadron was disbanded.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the surplus}} CSMs, CSM-119, was {{modified}} to carry two additional crew and kept on standby for a potential rescue mission in case of issues on-board Skylab. During Skylab 3, a malfunction on the Apollo CSM docked to the station caused fears that the crew {{would not be able}} to return safely. CSM-119 was wheeled out to Launch Complex 39B on Saturn IB SA-209 during the mission and prepared for a possible launch. Two astronauts, Brand (commander) and Lind (command module pilot), would have flown the CSM to retrieve the three crew members. The problem was fixed without requiring a <b>rescue</b> <b>flight.</b> CSM-119 was returned to the Vehicle Assembly Building and remained on standby until the Skylab program ended.|$|E

500|$|No. 76 Wing {{headquarters}} {{was established}} at Townsville, Queensland, on 3January 1944, {{and moved to}} Cairns mid-month. Led by Wing Commander Reginald Burrage, it transferred to Darwin, Northern Territory, in September to coordinate and control minelaying operations in the North-Western Area by Nos.20, 42, and 43 Squadrons. Each of the squadrons was equipped with PBY Catalina flying boats, nicknamed [...] "Black Cats"; No.20 had been based in Cairns with No.76 Wing headquarters, No.42 had just been formed at Darwin in August, while No.43 had been operating out of Darwin since March. Minelaying missions {{carried out by the}} RAAF over the past year had been credited with successfully disrupting enemy shipping for a much smaller outlay of operating hours than conventional bombing, and were thus considered profitable enough to dedicate a wing with three squadrons to furthering the work. Although the Catalinas were relatively slow and susceptible to enemy fighter attack, their loss rate was no more than one per 95 sorties. In addition to its flying squadrons, the wing controlled No.2 Flying Boat Maintenance Unit, No.11 Air Sea <b>Rescue</b> <b>Flight,</b> and No.3 Mobile Torpedo Unit. All units were located in Darwin except No.42 Squadron, which was based at Melville Bay.|$|E

[...] Eielson and Borland were attempting a <b>rescue</b> <b>flight</b> to an icebound ship in the Bering Sea when they were killed.
