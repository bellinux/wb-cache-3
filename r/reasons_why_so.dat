[...] "As she entered the stage, {{there was such a}} look of helplessness about her as to take away all the attractiveness," [...] wrote the religious author Evgeny Pogozhev (Poselyanin), remembering one such evening. Lokhvitskaya's shyness was one of the <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>so</b> little mention has been made of her in the extensive body of Russian Silver Age memoirs. Influential critic Akim Volynsky once confessed: [...] "Sadly, Lokhvitskaya, one of the most intriguing women of the time, left but a vague trace in my memory." ...|$|E

60|$|By such simple means, {{and without}} resistance, {{as it might}} be, did I recover the {{possession}} of my ship, the Dawn. But, now that the good vessel was in my power, it {{was by no means}} an easy thing to say what was to be done with her. We were just on the verge of the ground occupied by the channel cruisers, and it was preposterous to think of running the gauntlet among so many craft, with the expectation of escaping. It is true, we might fall in with twenty English man-of-war vessels, before we met with another Speedy, to seize us and order us into Plymouth, had everything been in order and in the usual state; but no cruiser would or could board us, and not demand the <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>so</b> large a ship should be navigated by so small a crew. It was over matters like these that Marble and I now consulted, no one being on the quarter-deck but the mate, who stood at the wheel, and myself. The cook was keeping a look-out on the forecastle. The Englishman had lain down, in full view, by my orders, {{at the foot of the}} main-mast; while Neb, ever ready to sleep when not on duty, was catching a nap on the booms.|$|E

60|$|Foreign {{commerce}} adds to {{the wealth}} of a state, according to Dr Adam Smith's definition, though not according {{to the definition of}} the economists. Its principal use, and the reason, probably, that it has in general been held in such high estimation is that it adds greatly to the external power of a nation or to its power of commanding the labour of other countries; but it will be found, upon a near examination, to contribute but little to the increase of the internal funds for the maintenance of labour, and consequently but little to the happiness of the greatest part of society. In the natural progress of a state towards riches, manufactures, and foreign commerce would follow, in their order, the high cultivation of the soil. In Europe, this natural order of things has been inverted, and the soil has been cultivated from the redundancy of manufacturing capital, instead of manufactures rising from the redundancy of capital employed upon land. The superior encouragement that has been given to the industry of the towns, and the consequent higher price that is paid for the labour of artificers than for the labour of those employed in husbandry, are probably the <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>so</b> much soil in Europe remains uncultivated. Had a different policy been pursued throughout Europe, it might undoubtedly have been much more populous than at present, and yet not be more incumbered by its population.|$|E
6000|$|Although {{your letter}} be {{directed}} to me, yet I take myself to be only an imaginary person; for, although I conjecture I had formerly one from you, yet I never answered it otherwise than in print; neither was I {{at a loss to}} know the <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>so</b> many people of this kingdom were transporting themselves to America. And if this encouragement were owing to a pamphlet written, giving an account of the country of Pennsylvania, to tempt people to go thither, I do declare that those who were tempted, by such a narrative, to such a journey, were fools, and the author a most impudent knave; at least, if it be the same pamphlet I saw when it first came out, which is above 25 years ago, dedicated to Will Penn (whom by a mistake you call [...] "Sir William Penn,") and styling him, by authority of the Scripture, [...] "Most Noble Governor." [...] For I was very well acquainted with Penn, and did, some years after, talk with him upon that pamphlet, and the impudence of the author, who spoke so many things in praise of the soil and climate, which Penn himself did absolutely contradict. For he did assure me that his country wanted the shelter of mountains, which left it open to the northern winds from Hudson's Bay and the Frozen Sea, which destroyed all plantations of trees, and was even pernicious to all common vegetables. But, indeed, New York, Virginia, and other parts less northward, or more defended by mountains, are described as excellent countries: but, upon what conditions of advantage foreigners go thither, I am yet to seek.[89] ...|$|E

50|$|There are {{a variety}} of <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>so</b> few Saudi Arabians chose to {{permanently}} live to the United States. Among these were the wealth of Saudi Arabia, the religious faith and pride of Saudis who found it difficult to maintain an Islamic lifestyle in the United States, and a lack of factors motivating citizens to leave Saudi Arabia. The limited number of marriages between US and Saudi citizens may also have contributed to the low number of Saudi immigrants and of Saudi Americans.|$|E

During the 1970, the Unregistered Land Act ended the last remnants of colonial administrative systems, which were replaced by central-state system of leasing land for large farming operations. “These land grabs by the government were also the <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>so</b> many farmers and pastoralists herders that saw their land assimilated into mechanized farming schemes, or simply registered in someone else’s name, joined the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) in the late 1980s” ...|$|E

Nancy felt strongly that {{she did not want to}} die alone. She resented the legal risk that her children might face should they have sat with her when she died. To protect them, Nancy invited supporters from the voluntary euthanasia group, Exit International, to be with her.|$|E

50|$|The WHO {{lists the}} {{leading causes of}} {{maternal}} death as severe bleeding, infections, high blood pressure during pregnancy, obstructed labor, and unsafe abortions. These causes compose approximately 80 percent of all maternal mortalities worldwide with the vast majority occurring in developing countries. The other remaining {{factors that contribute to}} maternal death include malaria, anemia, and HIV/AIDS during pregnancy. The WHO also states that the <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>so</b> many women die during childbirth are usually poverty, long distance to care, lack of information, inadequate service, and cultural practices. All of these causes of maternal death, and the corresponding reasons, are very familiar among women in Angola.|$|E

In the last years of his life, Sotler created a beautiful collection of paintings and ceramic sculptures.

5000|$|The <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>so</b> few TR7 Sprints were {{produced}} {{has been a}} matter of some debate, since it was never a catalogued model. It is widely assumed that the TR7 Sprints were built with the intention of it being produced for sale, but cancelled after only a few had been made. The suggestions are that it was either cancelled as a result of industrial action or because the sales and marketing department did not want it, as it was not a sufficient improvement over the TR7 base model or because it could not meet emissions legislation requirements for the US market - at which the TR7 and later TR8 were primarily aimed. It has also been noted that none of the suggested reasons for cancellation are a good match for when the main production ceased about the end of June 1977.|$|E

After a week to ten days of recording, during October 1994, Jon Bon Jovi erased it all. Recording continued over the next four months and it shifted between Jon Bon Jovi’s home studio Sanctuary I in Woodstock, NY, and three separate studios in Los Angeles: One On One Studios, Ocean Way Recording, and A&M Studios. There were various <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>so</b> many different studios were used.

The research also explored the <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>so</b> many students were {{dropping out of school}} and drew national attention to the “silent epidemic” of high school dropouts. [...] Spurred by the urgency to end this dropout crisis, America’s Promise launched the Dropout Prevention campaign in 2008, later named the GradNation campaign, and hosted 105 Dropout Prevention Summits in all 50 states from April 2008 until 2010. The summits worked to increase awareness about the dropout crisis, encourage collaboration between different sectors and organizations, and facilitate action in states and communities to improve their graduation rates.|$|E
