40|$|Organic <b>Rankine</b> <b>Cycles</b> are viable energy {{conversion}} systems in sustainable energy systems {{due to their}} compatibility with low-temperature heat sources. In the present study, one dimensional model of radial expanders {{in conjunction with a}} thermodynamic model of organic <b>Rankine</b> <b>cycles</b> is prepared. After verification, by defining thermal efficiency of the cycle and size parameter of a radial turbine as the objective functions, a multi-objective optimization was conducted regarding tension and vibration constraints for 4 different organic working fluids (R 22, R 245 fa, R 236 fa and N-Pentane). In addition to mass flow rate, evaporator temperature, maximum pressure of cycle and turbo-machinery design parameters are selected as the decision variables. Regarding Pareto fronts, by a little increase in size of radial expanders, it is feasible to reach high efficiency. Moreover, by assessing the distribution of decision variables, the variables that {{play a major role in}} trending between the objective functions are found.

25|$|An {{open circuit}} gas turbine cycle has a compressor, a {{combustor}} and a turbine. For gas turbines {{the amount of}} metal that must withstand the high temperatures and pressures is small, and lower quantities of expensive materials can be used. In this type of cycle, the input temperature to the turbine (the firing temperature), is relatively high (900 to 1,400°C). The output temperature of the flue gas is also high (450 to 650°C). This is therefore high enough to provide heat for a second cycle which uses steam as the working fluid (a <b>Rankine</b> <b>cycle).</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>Rankine</b> <b>cycle</b> is {{the most}} basic {{thermodynamic}} power cycle. The simplest cycle consists of a steam generator, a turbine, a condenser, and a pump.

The subcritical Rankine steam cycle is currently used in commercial power plants, with the newest plants utilizing the higher temperature, higher pressure, supercritical Rankine steam cycles. The work of ORNL from the 1960s and 1970s on the MSBR assumed the use of a standard supercritical steam turbine with an efficiency of 44%, and had done considerable design work on developing molten fluoride salt – steam generators.|$|E

Today, there is an enormous amount of waste steam and waste heat with temperatures between 100 and 150°C generated by industry. In addition, solarthermal collectors, geothermal energy sources and biomass reactors produce heat in this temperature range. There are technologies to utilise this energy, in particular the Organic <b>Rankine</b> <b>Cycle.</b> In principle, these are steam turbines which do not use water but a fluid (a refrigerant) which evaporates at temperatures below 100°C.

The {{scientific and technological}} experience accumulated by operating test reactors and, even, by running commercial reactors, makes them be considered as the closest Gen.

In the past their balance of plant has been always based on <b>Rankine</b> <b>cycles.</b> This paper investigates the potential use of supercritical recompression CO 2 cycles (S-CO 2) in SFRs {{on the basis of}} the working parameters foreseen within the European Sodium Fast Reactor (ESFR) project. A wide range of configurations have been explored, from the simplest one to combined <b>cycles</b> (with organic <b>Rankine</b> <b>cycles,</b> ORC), and a comparison has been set in terms of thermal efficiency. As a result, it has been found out that the most basic configuration could reach a thermal efficiency as high as 43. 31 %, which is comparable to that obtained through super-critical <b>Rankine</b> <b>cycles</b> proposed elsewhere. A sensitivity analysis together with an exergy study of this configuration, pointed the pre-cooler and IHXNa CO 2 as key components in the cycle performance.

The fusion system was expected to produce Q on the order of 25 to 30, resulting in 350 to 500MW of fusion energy. The fission processes triggered by the fusion would add an additional energy gain of 4 to 10 times, resulting in a total thermal output between 2000 and 5000MWth. Using high efficiency thermal-to-electric conversion systems like <b>Rankine</b> <b>cycle</b> designs in combination with demonstrated supercritical steam generators would allow about half of the thermal output to be turned into electricity.|$|E

2500|$|The {{conversion}} to electrical energy takes place indirectly, as in conventional thermal power stations. The fission {{in a nuclear}} reactor heats the reactor coolant. The coolant may be water or gas or even liquid metal {{depending on the type}} of reactor. The reactor coolant then goes to a steam generator and heats water to produce steam. [...] The pressurized steam is then usually fed to a multi-stage steam turbine. After the steam turbine has expanded and partially condensed the steam, the remaining vapour is condensed in a condenser. The condenser is a heat exchanger which is connected to a secondary side such as a river or a cooling tower. The water is then pumped back into the steam generator and the cycle begins again.
