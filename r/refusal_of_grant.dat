50|$|England in the 14th {{century was}} not {{ripe for a}} system that was found hard to make {{effective}} even in more advanced societies. Hence, from 1334 onward, the following method of apportionment was employed, i.e. a tenth and fifteenth was taken as affording a definite sum measured by the yield on the ancient valuation. As this gave between £38,000 and £39,000 in the aggregate, the tenth and fifteenth became for the future practically a fiscal expression for a sum of about £39,000, the total to be divided or apportioned between the several counties, cities and boroughs according to their former payments. This settlement, which remained in force for centuries and affected all later direct taxes, had the great advantages of certainty and adaptability. The inhabitants of any particular town knew their total liability and could distribute it amongst themselves in the manner most convenient to themselves. From the royal standpoint, the arrangement was also satisfactory, for the tenth and fifteenth could be multiplied (e.g. in 1352 three-tenths and fifteenths were voted for three years), and supplied a stable revenue for {{the service of the}} kingdom. Moreover, the power of regulating the policy of the crown by the bestowal or <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> <b>grants</b> was naturally agreeable to parliament. Thus, all sections of the nation united in support of the system established in 1334, just before the opening of the Hundred Years' War, in connection with which it was particularly serviceable.|$|R

[...] He was rural and local-minded, and economy was the passion of his public career. [...] "His economy of the public money was the severest, sharpest, most stringent and constant <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> almost any <b>grant</b> that could be proposed."

Unable to cope {{due to lack}} of resources and the <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> Congress to <b>grant</b> him extraordinary powers to govern, Arista resigned the presidency on January 5, 1853. In his resignation letter, Arista asked Congress to name Juan Bautista Ceballos (president of the Supreme Court) to assume the duties of government during the organizing of elections. After a quick vote, Congress named Ceballos interim president. He ordered the dissolution of both houses of Congress, which were plotting for the return of Santa Anna. Members of Congress instigated the garrison in Mexico City, which rose in support of Santa Anna and sparked riots. Ceballos resigned the presidency on February 7.|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{duration}} of patent examination at the European Patent Office (EPO). Our data contain variables that are correlates of the applicants’ and examiners’ assessments of a patent’s economic and technical relevance as well as ex post-application citation measures which indicate {{the impact of the}} patent application {{on the state of the}} art. We present descriptive statistics for 30 major technology fields. In our multivariate analysis we estimate competing risk specifications in order to characterize differences in the processes leading to either a withdrawal of the application by the applicant, a <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> the patent <b>grant</b> or an actual patent grant by the European Patent Office. Measuring a patent’s importance relying on the number of citations by subsequent patents we find that more important patents are approved faster by the EPO than less important patents but that applicants are more hesitant to withdraw these potentially valuable applications.

5000|$|In the Swiss {{immigration}} referendum, February 2014, {{a federal}} popular initiative [...] "against mass immigration", Swiss voters narrowly approved measures limiting {{the freedom of}} movement of foreign citizens to Switzerland. The European Commission said {{it would have to}} examine the implications of the result on EU-Swiss relations. Due to the <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> Switzerland to <b>grant</b> Croatia free movement of persons, the EU accepted Switzerland's access to the Erasmus+ student mobility program only as a [...] "partner country", as opposed to a [...] "programme country", and the EU froze negotiations on access to the EU electricity market. On March 4, 2016, Switzerland and the EU signed a treaty that extends the accord of the free movement of people to Croatia, something which lead to Switzerland's full readmission into Horizon 2020, a European funding framework for research and development. The treaty was ratified by the National Council on April 26 on the condition that a solution be found to an impasse on implementing the 2014 referendum. The treaty was passed in December 2016. This allowed Switzerland to rejoin Horizons 2020 on January 1, 2017.|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{duration}} of the patent examination process at the European Patent Office (EPO). Our data contain information related to the patent 2 ̆ 019 s economic and technical relevance, EPO capacity and workload as well as novel citation measures which are derived from the EPO 2 ̆ 019 s search reports. In our multivariate analysis we estimate competing risk specifications in order to characterize differences in the processes leading to a withdrawal of the application by the applicant, a <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> the patent <b>grant</b> by the examiner or an actual patent grant. Highly cited applications are approved faster by the EPO than less important ones, but they are also withdrawn less quickly by the applicant. The process duration increases for all outcomes with the application 2 ̆ 019 s complexity, originality, number of references (backward citations) in the search report and with the EPO 2 ̆ 019 s workload at the filing date. Endogenous applicant behavior becomes apparent in other results: more controversial claims lead to slower grants, but faster withdrawals, while relatively well-documented applications (identified by a high share of applicant references appearing in the search report) are approved faster and take longer to be withdrawn...|$|R
25|$|Largely due to {{the company}} nature of the settlement, {{development}} was slow, with the first bank not opening until 1859 and the town's first newspaper being printed in 1876. Until the National Bank established the first branch in Kooringa, most exchange was either {{in the form of}} company scrip or at shops operating as money exchanges. All towns, except Kooringa, were built outside the mining lease but were still close to the mine as it was at the northern edge of the lease. The formation of the townships was forced by the <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> SAMA to <b>grant</b> any freeholds within Kooringa, so miners began moving into other townships from the end of 1849. During their early lives each of the townships largely had their own hotels, churches, post offices, schools, and shops and identity. In 1851 the gold rush near Bathurst, New South Wales, emptied the town of many miners. Whole families, government officials and other townspeople left for the gold fields and by 1854 the town appeared largely deserted. The number of townships increased dramatically {{as a result of an}} 1858 proposal to extend a railway line from Gawler. When the railway failed to be built most of the new townships failed and, in 1876, the remaining townships formed the Corporation of Burra.|$|R
