In particular, molecular ions and primordial molecules such as H 2, HD and LiH will be produced. We summarize this primordial chemistry after the recombination epoch, and then present a simple gravitational collapse model of a cloud. The potentiality of fragmentation of this collapsing protoclouds through the thermal instability is also discussed. We suggest that this study could also be extended to the CO molecule, because the carbon <b>reservoir</b> <b>molecule</b> CO has already been observed in high redshifts objects...|$|E

40|$|This work {{examines}} {{measurements of}} ozone, NO, NO 2, and HCl {{made by the}} Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) to track chemical change in the stratosphere. In addition, HALOE observations of two long-lived species, HF and CH 4, are used as tracers to distinguish between change due to transport processes and change due to chemistry. The first study investigates the response of NO(x), (NO and NO 2) and ozone {{to the presence of}} large amounts of sulfate aerosol in the stratosphere following the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. As the Pinatubo aerosol cleared the atmosphere at 17 mb (about 27 - 28 km), the partitioning of total reactive nitrogen shifted more toward NO(x), and ozone amounts declined. This trend is opposite that observed at lower altitudes. The second study examines the chemical aftermath of severe ozone depletion over Antarctica in spring. When ozone levels drop to a threshold amount (about 1 ppm near 20 km), the partitioning of the total chlorine family shifts rapidly from reactive species to the <b>reservoir</b> <b>molecule</b> HCl. This sudden repartitioning shuts down further ozone loss and may be significant as filaments of air peel off the polar vortex and mix with mid-latitude air...|$|E

40|$|Three-dimensional model {{simulations}} {{are used}} to describe the January 31, 1989 ozone minihole over Stavanger, Norway. This minihole is typical of many transient events in the lower stratosphere that arise because of cyclonic-scale disturbances in the troposphere. Although the ozone reduction is a short-lived reversible dynamical event, through heterogeneous chemical processes there can be a significant transfer of chlorine from <b>reservoir</b> <b>molecules</b> to active radicals. This chemically perturbed air is defined as processed air, and it is found that a single event can produce enough processed air to reduce the HCl in the entire polar vortex. Chemical processing on clouds associated with transient events is shown to be a major source of processed air in the polar vortex in December before background temperatures are cold enough for more uniform heterogeneous conversion...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFrom January to March 2005, the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment high {{resolution}} Fourier transform spectrometer (ACE-FTS) on SCISAT- 1 measured {{many of the}} changes occurring in the Arctic (50 ? 80 ° N) lower stratosphere under very cold winter conditions. Here {{we focus on the}} partitioning between the inorganic chlorine reservoirs HCl and ClONO 2 and their activation into ClO. The simultaneous measurement of these species by the ACE-FTS provides the data needed to follow chlorine activation during the Arctic winter and the recovery of the Cl-reservoir species ClONO 2 and HCl. The time evolution of HCl, ClONO 2 and ClO as well as the partitioning between the two <b>reservoir</b> <b>molecules</b> agrees well with previous observations and with our current understanding of chlorine activation during Arctic winter. The results of a chemical box model are also compared with the ACE-FTS measurements and are generally consistent with the measurements...|$|R
40|$|This work {{reports a}} {{state-of-the-art}} theoretical characterization of four new sulfur-bromine species and five transition {{states on the}} [H, S(2), Br] potential energy surface. Our highest level theoretical approach employed the method coupled cluster singles and doubles with perturbative contributions of connected triples, CCSD(T), along with the series of correlation-consistent basis sets and with extrapolation to the complete basis set (CBS) limit in the optimization of the geometrical parameters and to quantify the energetic quantities. The structural and vibrational frequencies here reported are unique and represent the most accurate investigation to date of these species. The global minimum corresponds to a skewed structure HSSBr with a disulfide bond; {{this is followed by}} a pyramidal-like structure, SSHBr, 18. 85 kcal/mol above the minimum. Much higher in energy, we found another skewed structure, HSBrS (50. 29 kcal/mol), with one S-Br dative-type bond, and another pyramidal-like one, HBrSS (109. 80 kcal/mol), with two S-Br dative-type bonds. The interconversion of HSSBr into SSHBr can occur via a transfer of either the hydrogen or the bromine atom but involves a very high barrier of about 43 kcal/mol. These molecules are potentially a new route of coupling the sulfur and bromine chemistry in the atmosphere, and conditions of high concentration of H(2) S like in volcanic eruptions might contribute to their formation. We note that HSSBr can act as a <b>reservoir</b> <b>molecule</b> for the reaction between the radicals HSS and Br. Also, an assessment of the methods DFT/B 3 LYP/CBS and MP 2 /CBS relative to CCSD(T) /CBS provides insights on the expected performance of these methods on the characterization of polysulfides and also of more complex systems containing disulfide bridges.

However, the infiltration effects of two sides of CNT channel offset each other as no net water flux exists. As the net flux is regarded by the competition result of Brownian motion of two sides of CNT channel, enhancing or weakening one side competitiveness should be an effective method for pumping water. In previous work, pressure drop [12, 13], temperature difference [14, 15], and electric field [16] are common strategies to enhancing the competitiveness on one side to create net water flux.

40|$|Feedback and {{buffering}} [...] -the use of <b>reservoirs</b> of <b>molecules</b> {{to maintain}} molecular concentrations [...] -are the primary mechanisms for robust regulation in biochemical processes. The universal principles behind their combined effect, however, {{have not been}} studied before. Here, we determine the fundamental forms of cooperation and tradeoff between buffering and feedback. We find that negative feedback regulates slow-changing components of time-varying signals, while buffering regulates fast-changing components, consistent with observations of both ATP and pH regulation. We further find that buffering stabilizes feedback and improves its effectiveness, but also introduces molecular noise. In addition, we show that rapid-acting buffering imparts negative derivative feedback, while slow-acting buffering can result in feedforward filtering of specific signals; both are control strategies widely used in technology. Finally, we discover an empirical cross-species relationship between feedback in glycolysis and ATP buffering {{that is consistent with}} our findings...|$|R

The production of antibiotic or antifungal compounds is one of these mechanisms. The relevant molecules often exhibit valuable therapeutic properties. EXEGESIS: Chromobacterium violaceum is a soil-borne bacterium producing a characteristic antibiotic termed violacein. It is part of a series of compounds released by C. violaceum to oppose competitors and predators in the soil and water environments. Violacein, and one of these compounds, i. e. structure FR 901228, exhibit antiparasitic and antitumoral activities of potential medical interest. Genes involved in the synthesis of these compounds are available, the genome sequence of C. violaceum (strain ATCC 12472) being published.

40|$|Buffering, {{the use of}} <b>reservoirs</b> of <b>molecules</b> to {{maintain}} concentrations of key molecular species, and negative feedback are the primary known mechanisms for robust homeostatic regulation. To our knowledge, however, the fundamental principles behind their combined effect have not been elucidated. Here, we study the interplay between buffering and negative feedback {{in the context of}} cellular homeostasis. We show that negative feedback counteracts slow-changing disturbances, whereas buffering counteracts fast-changing disturbances. Furthermore, feedback and buffering have limitations that create trade-offs for regulation: instability in the case of feedback and molecular noise in the case of buffering. However, because buffering stabilizes feedback and feedback attenuates noise from slower-acting buffering, their combined effect on homeostasis can be synergistic. These effects can be explained within a traditional control theory framework and are consistent with experimental observations of both ATP homeostasis and pH regulation in vivo. These principles are critical for studying robustness and homeostasis in biology and biotechnology...|$|R

Surface aggregates at the liquid–air interfaces have been detected for the trisiloxanes that show superspreading behaviour onto moderately hydrophobic surfaces, while no aggregates were detected for the shorter trisiloxanes.

This enables high concentration storage of chlorine on the ice surface.

40|$|Background: Human {{platelets}} are a rich <b>reservoir</b> of <b>molecules</b> {{that promote}} regenerative processes and microbicidal activity. This activity might be increased by concentration in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) products and modulated {{by the presence}} of leukocytes. Despite extensive use in clinical procedures, only few studies have investigated PRP’s real microbicidal potential. Therefore, this study aimed at comparing the in vitro microbicidal activity of platelets and leukocyte-enriched PRP (L-PRP) to pure platelet-rich plasma (P-PRP) and the contribution of leukocytes to microbicidal properties. Antimicrobial effects of P- and L-PRP were tested against Escherichia Coli, Staphylococcus Aureus, Klebsiella Pneumoniae, Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and Enterococcus Faecalis. Furthermore, L-PRP was frozen (L-PRP cryo) to assess whether the preparation maintained in vitro characteristics. Microbicidal proteins released by the three preparations were also evaluated. Results: L-PRP, L-PRP cryo and P-PRP generally induced comparable bacterial growth inhibition for up to 4 h’ incubation, range 1 – 4 log. MIP- 1 α, RANTES, GRO-α, IL- 8, NAP- 2, SDF- 1 α and IL- 6 showed strong microbicidal potential. Conclusions: We found in vitro antibacterial activity of L-PRP and P-PRP and the possibility to cryopreserve L-PRP, without important changes to its effectiveness; similar microbicidal activity between preparations containing or not leukocytes; and the contribution of three new molecules (NAP- 2, SDF- 1 α and IL- 6) ...|$|R

The HZ was defined conservatively to be suitable for humans i. e. 0 °C 2 OH, hence less OH, an important sink for these two compounds. Ozone changes were smaller across the HZ. A source-sink analysis suggested the important process was a slowing in the O 3 +hv sink. We also considered changes in species which impact ozone – the so-called family species (and their reservoirs) which can catalytically destroy ozone. HCl, for example is a chlorine <b>reservoir</b> (storage) <b>molecule,</b> which increased by a factor 5 - 10 on moving outwards over the solar HZ. For the F 2 V and K 2 V stars, similar sources and sinks dominated the chemical biomarker budget as for the solar case and columns trends were comparable across the HZ.

40|$|Although {{the list}} of {{proteins}} that localize to the bacterial cell poles is constantly growing, {{little is known about}} their temporal behavior. EI, a major protein of the phosphotransferase system (PTS) that regulates sugar uptake and metabolism in bacteria, was shown to form clusters at the Escherichia coli cell poles. We monitored the localization of EI clusters, as well as diffuse molecules, in space and time during the lifetime of E. coli cells. We show that EI distribution and cluster dynamics varies among cells in a population, and that the cluster speed inversely correlates with cluster size. In growing cells, EI is not assembled into clusters in almost 40 % of the cells, and the clusters in most remaining cells dynamically relocate within the pole region or between the poles. In non-growing cells, the fraction of cells that contain EI clusters is significantly higher, and dispersal of these clusters is often observed shortly after exiting quiescence. Later, during growth, EI clusters stochastically re-form by assembly of pre-existing dispersed molecules at random time points. Using a fluorescent glucose analog, we found that EI function inversely correlates with clustering and with cluster size. Thus, activity is exerted by dispersed EI molecules, whereas the polar clusters serve as a <b>reservoir</b> of <b>molecules</b> ready to act when needed. Taken together our findings highlight the spatiotemporal distribution of EI as a novel layer of regulation that contributes to the population phenotypic heterogeneity with regard to sugar metabolism, seemingly conferring a survival benefit...|$|R
