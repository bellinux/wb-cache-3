25|$|The Gallardo LP 570-4 Super Trofeo Asia (亞洲限量版) was {{a limited}} (3 units, 1 in Taiwan) {{version of the}} LP 570-4 Super Trofeo 2013 for the Asian market. It {{included}} matt black carbon fibre tail wing, matt black carbon fibre engine cover, yellow body colour, high gloss carbon fibre door pedal, rear diffuser, rear view mirror cover; red ceramic carbon fibre brake caliper, Alcantara interior upholstery, 'Super Trofeo Asia' plaque at red <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> interior border with serial number, red stitching, carbon fibre upholstery at door trim, racing seats, centre console.|$|E
50|$|Trim {{levels are}} denoted {{by a small}} badge on the <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> on the VT/VTR+ and Airdream+ and by a small chrome badge on each front door on Exclusive models. Norev have {{produced}} a 1:43 scale model of the new Citroën C3 in Botticelli Blue, Metallic Green and black.|$|E

5000|$|Unusually trim {{levels and}} engine sizes were not liveried {{on the backs}} of the cars. Rather the trim levels were liveried on the sides of the cars by the Scorpio badges on the <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> as such. The Executive had no badge, simply the word [...] "Scorpio". Each other model had the model name under the badge, for example [...] "Scorpio Ultima." ...|$|R
5000|$|Known {{weaknesses}} included vibrations {{from the}} front end (largely fixed under warranty), cracking hinges on the rear door (due to the spare tyre's weight) and rust on <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> <b>frames.</b> The RD28T motor suffered from head gasket issues when driven with a heavy foot. European five-speed gearboxes suffered from bearing failures in fifth gear at high mileages. However, the TD42 was highly reliable [...] Patrols {{are known for their}} strong axles and good limited slip differential (when so equipped).|$|R
50|$|Additional {{details of}} the design include {{adaptive}} headlamps housed in hand polished surrounds designed to look like Baccarat crystal tumblers and chrome exhaust vents integrated into the rear bumper. The fenders are produced using a 5200-ton press, which when introduced was the world's strongest stamping press. The model's paint finish is applied to bare-metal body panels which are first prepared by a six-axis buffing robot with 3D movements, the entire paint finish is wet-sanded twice by hand between layers of paint application. Front and <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> are each constructed from a single die-cast zinc piece, plated in chrome and then polished by hand.|$|R

5000|$|The Apollo was {{essentially}} a re-branded Ford Verona sold from 1990 to 1992. More expensive and marketed as a sportier model, it was only available with the 1.8 L AP engine. Compared with the Verona, it has only minor differences. These are shorter gear ratios, stiffer shock absorbers, different dashboard with orange lightning (unlike the Verona, the Apollo do not share its dashboard with the Escort [...] ), smoked tail lights very seemed to the ones from the Ford Sapphire, chrome-less <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> <b>frames,</b> fixed-height front seats, painted mirrors (GLS trim) and airfoil. During the first model years, its front turn signals had clear lenses while the Verona had orange lenses. [...] Trim levels were GL (base model) and GLS. A special edition named VIP was released in 1991.|$|R
2500|$|Based on the AMC Concord, the 1980 AMC Eagle was {{introduced}} in August 1979 and available as a four-door sedan and station wagon, {{as well as a}} coupe. Standard equipment included power steering and power front disk and rear drum brakes, as well as 15-inch wheels with fiberglass belted radial whitewall tires. The Eagle came base and upscale Limited trims, both of which carried the same features as the Concord DL and Limited, respectively. A sports package was available only on the 2-door and wagon models featuring in addition to [...] "Sport" [...] emblems the following items: Durham Plaid fabric seat trim, leather-wrapped sport steering wheel, P195/75R15 Tiempo steel belted radial tires, sport fog lamps, halogen highbeam headlamps, dual black remote mirrors, 4X4 sport graphics, black bumpers with nerf strips, black lower body moldings, blackout grille, taillamp paint treatment, side tape stripes, and black moldings on the windshield, <b>rear</b> <b>window,</b> door <b>frames,</b> and B-pillar.|$|R
2500|$|The {{exterior}} {{featured a}} blacked out grille, headlight bezels, <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> molding, door and quarter <b>window</b> <b>frames,</b> <b>rear</b> license plate depression, and wiper arms, a black front air dam, black {{front and rear}} fender flares, dual flat black rear-view mirrors, black <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> louvers, black body side scuff moldings, silver [...] "targa" [...] roof band, contrasting [...] "AMX" [...] decals ahead of the rear wheels, silver slot-styled steel wheels, and body painted bumpers with black rubber guards and scuff moldings.|$|R
50|$|The rear {{elevation}} has three sash casement <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> with small hoppers over located between the symmetrical concrete frame and enclosing a <b>rear</b> verandah. <b>Windows</b> {{at ground level}} have window hoods supported on decorative timber brackets.|$|R
25|$|Sedan: A car seating four or {{more with}} a fixed roof that is full-height up to the <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b> Known in British English as a saloon. Sedans can have 2 or 4-doors. This {{is the most common}} body style. In the U.S., this term has been used to denote a car with fixed <b>window</b> <b>frames,</b> as opposed to the hardtop style wherein the sash, if any, winds down with the glass.|$|R
5000|$|The base XJ8 came {{standard}} {{with more}} equipment {{than had been}} fitted to entry-level XJs in the past, including leather upholstery, alloy wheels, and air conditioning. The door mirrors and door handles are body-coloured. [...] The radiator grille, windscreen and <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> surrounds, boot lid plinth, and rain gutters were chromed, while the <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> remained matte black. Interior wood trim is walnut. Rear badging reads [...] "XJ8".|$|R
50|$|The 304 {{changed little}} during a model life {{exceeding}} ten years. From the outside, the saloon received a simplified rear light cluster design in September 1972, and the Peugeot badge {{appearing on the}} front grille was now took on a gold coloured solid form {{in place of the}} silver/grey coloured outline badge that the car had worn hitherto. The roof line of the saloon was discreetly squared off to give greater headroom for <b>rear</b> passengers: the <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> on the <b>rear</b> doors were modified correspondingly, adding about and inch and a half to their rearmost upper edge and making them unique to the 304, while the car's front doors remained interchangeable with those on the 204. Changes under the metal included the replacement of the dynamo with an alternator in 1971 and the fitting of wider tyres in 1974. The hydraulically operated clutch was replaced with a cable operated mechanism in 1977.|$|R
50|$|The Sovereign model {{also used}} the AJ16 engine (in either 3.2 L or 4.0 L form), and came {{equipped}} with luxury features as standard such as ten-way electric leather seats with three-way memory on the driver's side, cruise control, automatic climate control and a tool kit located under the bonnet. The exterior of the Sovereign was adorned with chromed trim in various locations: on the radiator grille, rear light cluster surrounds, windscreen and <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> surrounds, rain gutters, <b>window</b> <b>frames,</b> and boot-lid plinth.|$|R
2500|$|Poor {{construction}} {{quality was}} apparent {{even in the}} company's press department fleet. The British magazine Motor published a road test of an automatic 3500 in January 1977, and while keen to highlight the Rover's general excellence, they also reported that the test car suffered from poor door seals, with daylight visible from inside past the <b>rear</b> door <b>window</b> <b>frame's</b> edge {{on the left side}} of the car, and a curious steering vibration at speed which might (or might not) have resulted from the car's front wheels not having been correctly balanced. Disappointment was recorded that the ventilation outlet directly in front of the driver appeared to be blocked, delivering barely a breeze even when fully open; the writer had encountered this problem on one other Rover 3500, although he had also driven other cars of the same type with an abundant output of fresh air through the vent in question. Nevertheless, in March 1977, Britain's Autocar was able to publish an article by Raymond Mays – a famous racing driver and team manager during (in particular) the 1930s, 1950s and 1960s – in which Mays explained why, after driving it for 12,000miles, he considered his Rover 3500 was [...] "the best car he [...] ever had", both for its many qualities as a driver's car and for its excellent fuel economy even when driven hard. Similar ventilation problems persisted until 1980 and were reported in tests of the V8-S version.|$|R
5000|$|The Sport {{model was}} {{equipped}} {{only with the}} 3.2 L normally aspirated engine, and, in 2002-2003 in the American market with a 4.0 L normally aspirated V8. It offered stiffer suspension, sportier seating and interior colour combinations, and wider/larger wheels than the XJ8. The windscreen and <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> surrounds were painted matte black, as were the rain gutters and <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> for European markets (the US retains chrome surrounds). The radiator grille has metallic grey vertical slats. Rather than a chrome radiator grille surround, the Sport uses a body-coloured surround. Rear badging reads [...] "XJ Sport".|$|R
50|$|On February 15, 1984, at 6:45 p.m., Hunt {{arrived at}} his gated home in Rome. As {{he was waiting for}} the gate to open, three gunmen emerged from a Fiat 128 across the street and opened fire on Hunt's Alfa Romeo armored {{limousine}} with automatic weapons. While none of the rounds fired at the limousine penetrated, one gunman jumped on the trunk and fired into the upper edge of the <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b> One of the 7.65mm rounds broke through the rubber and metal <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> and struck Hunt in the skull. He was taken to a local hospital in Rome, where he died an hour later.|$|R
5000|$|From 2 January 1984 to the [...] "S" [...] {{instead of}} the {{previous}} version [...] "de luxe" [...] was produced from VIN 19:00 401. The special design was characterized by matt black PVC door <b>window</b> <b>frames,</b> fittings trim with imitation leather in wood grain, trunk liner, fog lights (fog lights and -schlusslicht [...] ) two-tone horn, stick shift / steering wheel circuit, heated <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> and a Malimo corduroy interior. In addition, all models which until then had chromed body parts were black plastic powder coated. This {{is a sign of}} shortage of raw materials the East German economy and as an attempt {{to keep up with the}} prevailing taste step.|$|R
50|$|The Buick and Oldsmobile were {{introduced}} with fastback coupe styles, while the Chevy and Pontiac received notchbacks. Four-door fastback sedan models were also available. An interesting design compromise was non-lowering <b>rear</b> door <b>windows</b> on four-door sedans and wagons, which also reverted to full <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> while two-doors including El Caminos retained frameless glass. Performance applications include the Chevrolet Malibu F41 and M80, Pontiac LeMans GT, Oldsmobile 442 and Oldsmobile Hurst/Olds.|$|R
50|$|Side {{windows were}} not {{existent}} in open cars, {{which may have}} detachable side screens, or manually or power-operated glass side windows as in a saloon or sedan. <b>Rear</b> <b>windows</b> have evolved similarly, with plastic <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> appearing {{as late as the}} first-generation Porsche Boxster. Contemporary convertibles and retractable hardtops feature heatable glass <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> to maximize visibility - though <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> often can compromise visibility by their size, as with the case of the very small <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> and restricted visibility of the Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder. Plastic windows can degrade, fade, yellow, and crack over time, diminishing visibility.|$|R

5000|$|A rare {{option for}} the Phantom was a <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b> Monterey-Salinas Transit and King County Metro {{are the only two}} transit {{authorities}} known to have ordered Phantoms with a <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the Kapla@ <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> means a breakthrough in the timber <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> market in the Netherlands. This development is a typical example of a combined process and product innovation, a joint project with the relevant branch organizations. The success of the Kapla@ <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> proved that the methodology developed works well for such innovations. Special tools for mounting the <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> have been develope...|$|R
5000|$|They {{have also}} been {{extensively}} applied to <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> as well, where legislative measures have not banned such use. For instance in Sweden that is the normal place to put them and the bumper sticker is actually called [...] "bakrutedekal" [...] (<b>rear</b> <b>window</b> decal).|$|R
50|$|In 1970 a {{flow-through}} ventilation system, where vents {{were added}} towards {{the rear of}} the car (on the exterior under the <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> on the 142 and 144 and as a grille next to the right side taillight of the 145) and electrically defrosted <b>rear</b> <b>windows,</b> were introduced. The split <b>rear</b> side <b>window</b> on the 145 became one piece which was no longer possible to open.|$|R

50|$|The Ami {{was offered}} in saloon and break (estate) body styles over two generations, the Ami 6 and the Ami 8. The later Ami 8 {{fastback}} saloon featured a steeply raked <b>rear</b> <b>window,</b> {{in contrast to}} the earlier reverse-raked <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> of the Ami 6 notchback.|$|R

50|$|In 1957, Mercury {{introduced}} the Mercury Turnpike Cruiser, featuring a roofline with a retractable <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b> From 1958 to 1960, the feature made its {{return on the}} Continental Mark-series line, with a reverse-slant <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> (on both hardtops and convertibles). For 1963, Mercury re{{introduced the}} feature as an option for the Monterey; to streamline production, elements of the window design were shared with Ford station wagons. From 1963 to 1966, the optional reverse-slant roofline with retracting <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> was unique to Mercury, featured by no other American brand.|$|R
5000|$|The all-steel body {{followed}} modern styling trends, and {{featured a}} [...] "panoramic wrap-around" [...] <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> and tail fins. There was space for four people, {{although the two}} in the back would have found their head room rather restricted. The sales material of the time makes much of the car's passive safety features, such as the two spoke steering wheel with a recessed central hub, rounded door handles and a lock on the front seat-backs {{to prevent them from}} tilting forwards unexpectedly. The padded dashboard and interior <b>window</b> <b>frames</b> were also unusual, and the claim can certainly be made that in terms of secondary safety (US English: [...] "crashworthiness") the Lloyd Arabella marked a step forward for cars of this class. [...] The spare wheel was stowed below the rear luggage compartment. It was stowed externally which meant it could be accessed without having to empty out the luggage locker.|$|R
