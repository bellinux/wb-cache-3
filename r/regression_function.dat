The corresponding gradients and Hessian matrices are worked out analytically, using the Implicit Function Theorem if necessary, which leads to fast and stable computation. Our main contribution is developing the modified delta method to estimate the variances of the <b>regression</b> <b>functions,</b> which include the uncertainty of the smoothing parameter estimates.

For a long time, however, its main theory is about the continuous <b>regression</b> <b>functions</b> (c. f. Draper and Smith (1981), Hardle (1990), etc.). Recently, discontinuous <b>regression</b> <b>functions</b> have gotten more and more attention from statisticians all over the world. This, we think, is mainly due to their great application background (e. g. Wahba (1986) used the discontinuous regression model to explore the equi-temperature surfaces of the high sky and the deep ocean). By now, we have found that jump <b>regression</b> <b>functions</b> are discussed in two statistical fields. One is the change-point field, in which statisticians discuss the jump r [...] ...|$|R

Multidimensional density estimation using Dirichlet mixture models provides the theoretical basis for semi-parametric regression methods in which fitted <b>regression</b> <b>functions</b> may be deduced as means of conditional predictive distributions. These Bayesian <b>regression</b> <b>functions</b> have features similar to gener-alised kernel regression estimates, but the formal analysis addresses problems of multivari-ate smoothing, parameter estimation, and {{the assessment of}} uncertainties about <b>regression</b> <b>functions</b> naturally.

In the extreme case, if there are p variables in a linear regression with p data points, the fitted line will go exactly through every point. There is a variety of rules of thumb for the number of observations needed per independent variable, including 10 [...] and 10-15. In the process of regression model selection, the mean squared error of the random <b>regression</b> <b>function</b> can be split into random noise, approximation bias, and variance in the estimate of <b>regression</b> <b>function,</b> and bias-variance tradeoff is often used to overcome overfit models.|$|E

A detailed simulation study finds the size of the new test near the nominal level and a good power for a variety of parametric models.

50|$|Although {{polynomial}} regression {{is technically}} {{a special case}} of multiple linear regression, the interpretation of a fitted polynomial regression model requires a somewhat different perspective. It {{is often difficult to}} interpret the individual coefficients in a polynomial regression fit, since the underlying monomials can be highly correlated. For example, x and x2 have correlation around 0.97 when x is uniformly distributed on the interval (0, 1). Although the correlation can be reduced by using orthogonal polynomials, it is generally more informative to consider the fitted <b>regression</b> <b>function</b> as a whole. Point-wise or simultaneous confidence bands can then be used to provide a sense of the uncertainty in the estimate of the <b>regression</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, three example-based single-image super-resolution {{methods and}} a {{benchmark}} study are presented. The three super-resolution methods individually explore domain-specific, {{efficient and effective}} super-resolution solutions. The first method is developed for face images which contain domain-specific content. Test images are decomposed into facial components, edges, and smooth regions to develop adequate upsampling processes independently. Exemplar regions are exploited to transfer high-resolution details to reconstruct high-quality facial components. The second method is designed to generate super-resolution results efficiently for generic images. Multiple <b>regression</b> <b>functions</b> are trained to predict high-resolution patch features from low-resolution ones. By splitting the feature space into numerous subspaces and collecting sufficient exemplars for each subspace, the trained <b>regression</b> <b>functions</b> efficiently generate effective features to reconstruct high-resolution images. The third method integrates <b>regression</b> <b>functions</b> and patch exemplars to fully exploit exemplars to generate high-quality super-resolution images. As <b>regression</b> <b>functions</b> stably estimate high-resolution features and exemplar patches contain rich high-frequency signals, the proposed method uses <b>regression</b> <b>functions</b> to generate a robust intermediate high-resolution image and then finds effective exemplar patches to enrich the high-frequency signals. The benchmark study systematically compares the performance of state-of-the-art super-resolution methods under numerous parameter settings and test images. It investigates the effect of important parameters qualitatively and quantitatively and figures out the effectiveness of many metrics via human subject studies. In summary, this dissertation thoroughly and deeply investigates single-image super-resolution problems and propose solutions using exemplar images...|$|R

50|$|Another {{disadvantage}} of LOESS {{is the fact}} that it does not produce a <b>regression</b> <b>function</b> that is easily represented by a mathematical formula. This can make it difficult to transfer the results of an analysis to other people. In order to transfer the <b>regression</b> <b>function</b> to another person, they would need the data set and software for LOESS calculations. In nonlinear regression, on the other hand, it is only necessary to write down a functional form in order to provide estimates of the unknown parameters and the estimated uncertainty. Depending on the application, this could be either a major or a minor drawback to using LOESS. In particular, the simple form of LOESS can not be used for mechanistic modelling where fitted parameters specify particular physical properties of a system.|$|E

50|$|In statistics, {{regression}} analysis is a statistical process for estimating {{the relationships among}} variables. It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when {{the focus is on}} the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. More specifically, {{regression analysis}} helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or 'criterion variable') changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed. Most commonly, regression analysis estimates the conditional expectation of the dependent variable given the independent variables - that is, the average value of the dependent variable when the independent variables are fixed. Less commonly, the focus is on a quantile, or other location parameter of the conditional distribution of the dependent variable given the independent variables. In all cases, the estimation target is a function of the independent variables called the <b>regression</b> <b>function.</b> In regression analysis, it is also of interest to characterize the variation of the dependent variable around the <b>regression</b> <b>function</b> which can be described by a probability distribution.|$|E

The prototype focuses on three specific parameters including the number of nodes allocated for a specific job n, the size of the database s, and the number of input files to be compared d and has been evaluated within a case study. Therein we retrieved accurate results on different computing resources [22]. Following this, the performance prediction is based on historical execution time and <b>regression</b> <b>functions.</b> While the approach could be easily extended with support for additional parameters, it is shown that considering only a subset of parameters can results in appropriate estimations. Different types of computing resources implicate changes in the runtime of the application. Therefore, the <b>regression</b> <b>functions</b> are not completely independent of the utilized computing resources (Cloud or cluster resources), but have to be adapted with a weighting factor regarding the allocated computing resources.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a generalized regression technique {{centered on a}} superquantile (also called conditional value-at-risk) {{that is consistent with}} that coherent measure of risk and yields more conservatively fitted curves than classical least-squares and quantile regressions.

5000|$|LOESS, {{originally}} {{proposed by}} Cleveland (1979) and further developed by Cleveland and Devlin (1988), specifically denotes {{a method that}} {{is also known as}} locally weighted polynomial regression. At each point in the range of the data set a low-degree polynomial is fitted to a subset of the data, with explanatory variable values near the point whose response is being estimated. The polynomial is fitted using weighted least squares, giving more weight to points near the point whose response is being estimated and less weight to points further away. The value of the <b>regression</b> <b>function</b> for the point is then obtained by evaluating the local polynomial using the explanatory variable values for that data point.
