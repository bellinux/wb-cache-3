Our experiments were conducted on a cluster of UltraSparcs connected via SBus- 2 SCI adapter cards and an SCI switch.

As our experiments show, SCI offers much lower latencies than other cluster of workstation architectures, including a Myrinet based cluster, and other parallel machines like the Meiko CS- 2. The simple <b>remote</b> <b>load</b> and store transactions supported by SCI allow for a very low latency implementation of the data transfer.

40|$|In this paper, the {{mechanics}} of a semi-infinite crack interacting with near crack-tip singularities (e. g., dislocations) in two-dimensional solids is investigated using the concept of potential energy release rate. The spontaneous relationship between the crack potential energy release rate and the well-known vector conservative integral J i (i = 1, 2) is derived. It is demonstrated that J 1 and J 2 integrals are equally important in solving crack problems. This allows a more rational criterion to be proposed, based on the criterion of maximum energy release rate, to assess the so-called shielding/amplification effect on the crack tip due {{to the presence of}} the singularities. It is shown that the new criterion can not only assess the shielding/amplification effect under pure mode I or mode II <b>remote</b> <b>loading,</b> but also efficiently assess crack-singularity interaction under mixed mode <b>remote</b> <b>loading.</b> Simultaneously, it is found by re-examining the J i integrals that there exists a simple but universal relation among the three values of the vector J i integral corresponding separately to the contributions induced from the semi-infinite crack tip, the singularity, and the <b>remote</b> <b>loading.</b> Next, a multi-singularity-crack interaction model is addressed, and the closed-form solution is obtained. Finally, as an example, the problem of a single dislocation interacting with a main crack is solved to demonstrate the validity of the proposed model and the new criterion. </p...|$|E

A single-server/multi-client architecture which enables the neighboring power systems to access the <b>remote</b> <b>load</b> flow server at any time, with their respective data and to get the load flow solutions from the remote server has been proposed. An RMI (Remote Method Invocation) based distributed environment has been implemented in such a way that for every specific period of time, the remote server obtains the system data simultaneously from the neighboring power systems which are the clients registered with the <b>remote</b> <b>load</b> flow server and the load flow solutions from the server have been sent back to the respective clients.

A three {{dimensional}} solid {{finite element}} model was assembled to investigate the influence of parameters such as friction coefficient, fastener preload and material plasticity on the structural response of Hi-Lok bolted single-lap joints under <b>remote</b> tension/compression <b>loading.</b> Three different specimen types which produce nominal load transfer levels of 6 %, 30 % and 50 % have been investigated. The effects of these parameters where characterized in terms of load transfer, fastener rotation, and stress concentration factor. Friction coefficient has been varied from 0 to 1. 25 and the fastener preloads of 1. 35 lbs, 13. 5 lbs and 135 lbs were assigned for different simulations. Furthermore, constant amplitude load cycles of 15, 20, 30 and 40 Ksi were applied in different FE analysis. Results of elastic and isotropic hardening based elastic-plastic material models have been compared and effects of plasticity have been explored. The analysis results indicate that friction coefficient {{is the most important}} parameter and friction has a great influence on load transfer, stress concentration and fastener rotation, for all loading conditions, and for both elastic and elastic-plastic material models. Friction, which is affected by both friction coefficient and clamp-up force, has the most influence on load transfer and stress concentration factor at lower <b>remote</b> <b>loads</b> and smaller amount of load transfer. Plasticity which is more prevalent at high <b>remote</b> <b>loads</b> reduces load transfer and stress concentration factors, especially during tension...|$|R

It was shown that doxorubicin can be loaded {{to a level}} of up to 98 % into large unilamellar vesicles composed of egg phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol (7 / 3  mol/mol) with a transmembrane phosphate gradient. The different encapsulation efficiencies which were achieved with ammonium salts (citrate 100 %, phosphate 98 %, sulfate 95 %, acetate 77 %) were significantly higher as compared to the loading via sodium salts (citrate 54 %, phosphate 52 %, sulfate 44 %, acetate 16 %). Various factors, including pH-value, buffer capacity, solubility of doxorubicin in different salt solutions and base counter-flow, which likely has an influence on drug accumulation in the intraliposomal interior are taken into account. In contrast to other methods, the newly developed <b>remote</b> <b>loading</b> method exhibits a pH-dependant drug release property which may be effective in tumor tissues. At physiological pH-value doxorubicin is retained in the liposomes, whereas drug release is achieved by lowering the pH to 5. 5 (approximately 25 % release at 25  °C or 30 % at 37  °C within two h).
