40|$|Aspects of {{curved beam}} effects and their {{importance}} in designing composite frame structures are discussed. The curved beam effect induces <b>radial</b> <b>flange</b> loadings {{which in turn}} causes flange curling. This curling increases the axial flange stresses and induces transverse bending. These effects are more important in composite structures due to their general inability to redistribute stresses by general yielding, such as in metal structures. A detailed finite element analysis was conducted and used {{in the design of}} composite curved frame specimens. Five specimens were statically tested and compared with predicted and test strains. The curved frame effects must be accurately accounted for to avoid premature fracture; finite element methods can accurately predict most of the stresses and no elastic relief from curved beam effects occurred in the composite frames tested. Finite element studies are presented for comparative curved beam effects on composite and metal frames...|$|E
40|$|Reducing {{the number}} of {{transitions}} of manufacturing products {{and the increase in}} the degree of deformation at a transition in shaping sheet metal forming processes can improve the performance of manufacturing and makes the resulting products competitive. For the drawing process developed ways of shaping with the use of differential <b>radial</b> <b>flange</b> backwater using liquid drawing in a die of special profile and the combined drawing in the double cone die special profile. Using computer simulation by the method of finite elements, was found that application of backwater significantly reduce the amount of tensile stresses in the dangerous section, which result is the destruction of the wall. Reduction of these strains has increased the degree of deformation in one transition and reduce {{the number of}} drawing transitions. The use of traditional drawing in a die of special profiles and combined drawing in double-cone die of special profile also reduced the number of presswork transitions. The experimental results confirmed the results of the calculations. Was found the analytical dependences for determining the parameters of the combined drawing in the double-cone die. For processes of reducing tubular and hollow bottom blanks were used the application of liquid back pressure to the inner surface of the blanks and reducing was applied in the die of special profile. Calculation found that counter-pressure application with reducing of tubular of steel billets leads to the exclusion of loss of stability of the preform wall and forming of the cross-ribbed on the wall and on the deformed part of the workpiece, which allowed to obtain products with the neck in one transition. During reducing was applied cone and spherical dies of special profile. In such dies deforming surface is formed by the intersection of the circles of constant diameter whose centers are positioned at an angle with a certain step. Forming on these surfaces ensure the reduction of the friction forces in forming and increasing the degree of deformation in one transition. Using the pre-operation profiling wall of tubular or hollow blanks with the bottom results in reducing products of constant wall thickness. Prototypes of products was obtained by experimental way. Was founded the analytical dependences for determining the reducing force, the shape and size of the deformed part of the blanks. The developed method of outward flanging of the holes in the sheet metal blanks and profiles provides receiving of deformed part with a constant wall thickness without distortion. Constant wall thickness leads to an increase in the height of products after outward flanging with thinning and increased reliability and durability detachable and permanent joints which are formed by outward flanging products with other items. Using the pre-profiling of the blanks and profiles by cold extrusion forming holes followed by punching jumper leads to saving metal. Calculations and experiments have shown the possibility of obtaining constant wall thickness. For engineering calculation of parameters of preliminary profiling blanks and parameters of outward flanging was founded analytical according to the definition of power modes, the specific efforts on the instrument and final shape and size of deformed blanks. For various configurations of flanges on tubular workpieces and pipes was developed method of bulging by punch of special profile. At such punch deforming surface is formed by the intersection of the circles of constant diameter whose centers are located at an angle to the corresponding step. By computer simulation was found and confirmed by experiment punch profile, which provides a reduction of the friction forces in the forming in the bulging processes and increase the bulging ratio. ?????????? ?????????? ????????? ???????????? ??????? ? ?????????? ??????? ?????????? ?? ???? ??????? ? ??????????????? ????????? ???????? ????????? ????????? ???????? ?????????????????? ???????????? ? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ???????????????????. ??? ????????? ??????? ??????????? ??????? ???????????????? ?? ??????????? ??????????????????? ??????????? ??????? ?????? ? ??????? ????????, ??????? ? ??????? ???????????? ??????? ? ??????????????? ??????? ? ???????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????. ? ?????????????? ????????????? ????????????? ??????? ???????? ????????? ???????????, ??? ?????????? ??????? ??????????? ????????? ???????? ????????????? ?????????? ? ??????? ???????, ??????? ???????? ? ?????????? ??????. ?????????? ????????? ?????????? ????????? ????????? ??????? ?????????? ?? ???? ??????? ? ??????? ?????????? ????????? ???????. ????????????? ????????????? ??????????? ? ??????? ???????????? ??????? ? ???????????????? ??????????? ? ???????????? ??????? ???????????? ??????? ????? ????????? ????????? ?????????? ????????? ?????????. ??????????? ????????????????? ???????????? ??????????? ?????????? ????????. ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ??? ??????????? ?????????? ??????????????? ??????? ? ???????????? ???????; ??? ????????? ?????? ????????? ? ????? ????????? ? ???? ???? ???????????? ?????????? ??????????????? ? ??????? ???????? ?? ?????????? ??????????? ????????? ? ???????? ????? ? ??????? ???????????? ???????. ???????? ???????????, ??? ?????????? ??????????????? ??? ?????? ????????? ????????? ?? ????? ???????? ? ?????????? ?????? ???????????? ?????? ????????? ? ??????????? ?????????? ???? ?? ?????? ? ???????????????? ????? ?????????, ??? ????????? ???????? ??????? ? ?????????? ?? ???? ???????. ??? ?????? ????????? ???????? ?? ??????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????. ? ????? ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ?????????? ???????????? ??????????? ??????????? ????????, ?????? ??????? ??????????? ??? ????? ? ???????????? ?????. ?????????????? ?? ????? ???????????? ?????????? ?????????? ??????? ??? ?????? ??? ???????????????? ? ?????????? ??????? ?????????? ?? ???? ???????. ????????????? ??????????????? ???????? ?????????????? ?????? ????????? ??? ????? ????????? ? ???? ???????? ? ????????? ??????? ??????? ?? ?????????? ???????? ??????. ????????????????? ????? ???????? ??????? ??????? ???????. ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ??? ??????????? ?????? ??????, ????? ? ???????? ???????????????? ????? ?????????. ????????????? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ? ???????? ?????????? ? ???????? ???????????? ????????? ???????????????? ????? ? ?????????? ???????? ?????? ??? ???????????. ?????????? ??????? ?????? ???????? ? ?????????? ?????? ??????? ????? ?????????? ? ?????????? ? ????????? ?????????? ? ????????????? ????????? ? ??????????? ??????????, ??????? ?????????? ?????????????? ????????? ? ??????? ????????. ????????????? ???????????????? ?????????????? ???????? ????????? ? ???????? ????? ???????????????? ????????? ???????? ????????????? ? ??????????? ????????? ????????? ???????? ? ???????? ???????. ???????? ? ????????????? ???????? ??????????? ????????? ?????? ?????????? ???????. ??? ?????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????????????? ?????????????? ????????? ? ?????????? ?????????? ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ??? ??????????? ??????? ???????, ???????? ?????? ?? ??????????? ? ???????? ????? ? ???????? ???????????????? ?????????. ??? ????????? ??????? ????????? ???????????? ?? ????????? ?????????? ? ?????? ?????????? ?????? ??????? ????????? ???????????? ???????. ? ?????? ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ?????????? ???????????? ??????????? ??????????? ????????, ?????? ??????? ??????????? ??? ????? ? ??????????????? ?????. ???????????? ?????????????? ?????????? ? ??????????? ????????????? ??????? ????????, ??????? ???????????? ?????????? ??????? ??? ?????? ?? ???????????????? ??? ??????? ? ?????????? ???????????? ???????...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Deep Drawing is {{a widely}} used sheet metal shape {{transformation}} process with material retention. From Automobile components to plumbing and sanitary ware, this process is used for mass production of industrial and domestic artifacts with the depth greater than corresponding diameter. Deep drawing process using a die-punch pair on a press induces <b>radial</b> stresses on <b>flange</b> region and compressive stresses {{on the center of}} a blank to provide a permanent shape change. The production quality and cost associated depend upon obtained thickness distribution and an accurate prediction of formability. This demands a coherent set of correlations between various parameters associated with deep drawing. This study reviews various theoretical and experimental attempts made to connect punching force, blank holding force, dome height, thickness of blank etc. with thickness distribution on final products. The focus is also drawn onto various modes of failures for different shapes of products and associated problems including creasing and wrinkling, crushing and cracking of sheet metal parts. Conclusions are drawn to suggest impact of isolated deviation of one or more parameters on the resulted product...|$|R
40|$|The lower hybrid (LH) {{launcher}} configuration {{has been}} redesigned {{to integrate the}} functions of the vertical four-way power splitter and the front waveguide array (front array). This permits 256 waveguide channels to be fed by only 64 waveguides at the vacuum window interface. The resulting configuration is a more compact coupler, which incorporates the simplicity of a multijunction coupler while preserving the spectral flexibility of a conventional lower hybrid launcher. Other spin-offs of the redesign are reduction in thermal incompatibility between the front array and vacuum windows, improved maintainability, in situ vacuum window replacement, a reduced number of radio frequency (rf) connections, and a weight reduction of 7300 kg. There should be a significant cost reduction as well. Issues associated with the launcher design and fabrication have been addressed by a research and development program that includes brazing of the front array and testing of the power splitter configuration to confirm that phase errors due to reflections in the shorted splitter legs will not significantly impact the rf spectrum. The Conceptual Design Review requires that radiation levels at the torus <b>radial</b> port mounting <b>flange</b> and outer surface of the toroidal field coils should be sufficiently low to permit hands-on maintenance. Low activation materials and neutron shielding are incorporated in the launcher design to meet these requirements. The launcher is configured to couple 3 MW of steady state LH heating/LH current drive power at 3. 7 GHz to the Tokamak Physics Experiment plasma...|$|R
