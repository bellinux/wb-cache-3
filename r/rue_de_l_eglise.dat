40|$|Un problème relationnel évident entre <b>l</b> <b>Eglise</b> Catholique et les Média constituait le point de départ de cette thèse de doctorat. <b>Des</b> membres <b>de</b> <b>l</b> <b>Eglise</b> se plaignent à répétition de la machinerie des Média et leur préférence pour les scandales et des accroches négatives. La {{critique}} est que <b>l</b> image <b>de</b> <b>l</b> <b>Eglise</b> créée par les Média ne correspond pas à la réalité, les aspects positifs sont souvent ignorés. Mais de quelle façon les Média représentent effectivement <b>l</b> <b>Eglise</b> ? La thèse répond à cette question en démontrant les conditions de communication médiatiques ainsi qu en décrivant <b>l</b> image <b>de</b> <b>l</b> <b>Eglise</b> dans les discours journalistiques. The {{relationship between}} the Catholic Church and the media is apparently difficult. Members of the church frequently complain about the media s partiality for scandals and negative headlines. The Catholic Church, they say, is portrayed in an excessively bad light, while positive aspects are overlooked. But how does the press actually write about the Church? By illustrating media-related terms of communication and characterizing the Church s image in press-discourse, the current thesis answers this question. On the assumption that impartial reality is not available and therefore not illustratable, news coverage never reflects reality, but reconstructs it. Reality as transported by the media is affected by ideas about life and moral concepts not only by journalists, but also by editorial boards, cultures and other media-related terms of communication. Thereby, and through factors influencing the selection of news, e. g. focussing on hot potatoes and bad news, coverage of the Church turns out one-sided and negative. This thesis is, on the one hand, a media-linguistic investigation, but also uses an interdisciplinary approach by drawing upon knowledge of linguistic sub-disciplines {{as well as of}} media- and communication science. In 2009, a sample of 212 articles of Austrian and French daily newspapers was investigated by means of Inhaltsanalyse (content analysis) following Werner Früh and Kritischer Diskursanalyse (critical discourse analysis) following Siegfried Jäger. The articles (Austria: Die Presse, Der Standard, Kronen Zeitung; France: Aujourd hui en France, Le Figaro, Le Monde) were reviewed with regard to content, topic and language. Only such articles were chosen, which were information- and opinion-centred and in line with the editorial board. Additionally, journalists of the mentioned newspapers were interviewed to gain information on the coverage of religious issues and the attitude of the editorial staff towards the Catholic Church. The content analysis was, on the one hand, aimed at the classification of reported topics. On the other hand, news factors should be identified, which were relevant for the selected events. Finally, the content analysis should gain information on to what extent topic structure and distribution of news factors differed between the newspapers. The discourse analysis particularly aimed at classifying content and language of explicit and implicit comments in the articles. In addition, linguistic characteristics of coverage of the Catholic Church should be identified, as far as they allowed conclusions to be drawn with respect to underlying ideologies. Finally, press photos should be analysed in terms of ideological and evaluative contents. Comparison of the different newspapers should permit to trace the individual editorial staff s principles and identify country-and culture-specific differences, as the relationship between state and church is regulated differently. While in France there is a very strict disestablishment of state and church (Laizism), in Austria there is a system of cooperation, which is founded in a concordat. This thesis shows, that all of the reviewed daily newspapers consider the topic Catholic Church as socio-politically relevant. At the same time, no consistent disapproval of the Church by means of the media was visible. This becomes evident by the quite extensive and frequent coverage that expands for example into the rubric politics. Furthermore, all of the reviewed newspapers had one journalist being in charge of topics concerning catholic matters, and who was socialised in - and in many cases - is close to the Church [...] PARIS 5 -Bibliotheque electronique (751069902) / SudocSudocFranceF...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} make its {{fisheries}} cooperation programme more widely known, and to promote the exchange of information and experience among people working in the field, in December 1988 the European Community launched a bilingual quarterly 'EC Fisheries Cooperation Bulletin/ CE Cooperation Peche'. The editorial team, which includes two fisheries development officers working in the Commission's Directorate General for Development, is currently exploring ways of increasing the bulletin's information value and relevance {{to those in the}} field, who are often isolated from others working on similar projects. One way of doing this, they believe, IS to standardize certain key fisheries data on countries and projects for a quick overview, thus leaving more space for project details and experience. Each issue will be thematic, though there will be a range of briefer news items about new developments, projects and other activities. In 1990 the themes will be: March - credit for fishing communities; June - aquaculture; September - the aquatic environment/ecology of tropical waters.
