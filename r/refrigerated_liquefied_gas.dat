40|$|When a {{chemical}} accident occurs, the release {{depends on the}} status of the substance(s) in either the damaged process unit or carrier, i. e. the accident dynamics differs in presence of a compressed gas, a <b>refrigerated</b> <b>liquefied</b> <b>gas,</b> a compressed liquefied gas, or a subcooled liquid. In addition, the release properties (e. g., flow rate, liquid and vapor fractions, temperature, and momentum) may vary dynamically due to the modification of the conditions inside the damaged process unit and/or to the intervention of either the operator or the control system. This manuscript describes the features that an accident simulator should implement to account for the release variability. In particular, the paper focuses on the release of liquids, their spreading, and the formation of pools and pool-fires. The recommended features include the capability to simulate the automatic switch of the liquid pool from spreading to shrinking, its vanishing, the release in a bund, its ignition, the evaluation of the pool-fire geometrical dimensions and the heat flux radiated to the surrounding equipment and field operators. By implementing these features in an accident simulator, it is possible to get a more realistic picture of the accident dynamics, and of its magnitude and consequences. An accident simulator having the aforementioned features can be linked to a dynamic process simulator to evaluate the dynamics of the plant operating conditions during the accident unfolding, for both risk assessment and operators' training purposes. These features have been implemented in a simulator program, which is based on CPU-efficient models and algorithms, with the scope of demonstrating the feasibility of the discussed approach and its advantages. The importance of the aforementioned features is illustrated by means of some dedicated case-studies. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The ISO/TC 220 « Cryogenic vessels » covers {{standardization}} in {{the field}} of insulated vessels (vacuum or non-vacuum) for the storage and the transport of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>liquefied</b> <b>gases</b> of class 2 of “Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods – Model regulations – of the United Nations”. In particular, it concerns the design of the vessels and their safety accessories, gas/materials compatibility, insulation performance, the operational requirements of the equipment and accessories. The European Industrial Gas Association, EIGA, is a safety and technically oriented organization representing a majority of European and a number of non-European companies producing and distributing industrial, medical and food gases. The EIGA/WG 6 ’s scope is cryogenic vessels and accessories, including their design, material compatibility, operational requirements and periodical inspection. The specific responsibilities include monitoring international standardization (ISO, CEN) and regulations (UN, TPED, PED), to prepare Codes of Practice or Guidelines in this field and, to review accidents and incidents, determine the causes and propose ways to avoid re-occurrence. During this presentation the main standards of ISO/TC 220 and the documents from EIGA/WG 6 will be presented...|$|R
25|$|Methane {{is used in}} {{industrial}} chemical processes and may be transported as a <b>refrigerated</b> liquid (<b>liquefied</b> natural <b>gas,</b> or LNG). While leaks from a refrigerated liquid container are initially heavier than air due to the increased density of the cold gas, the gas at ambient temperature is lighter than air.
