Africans wanted to occupy estate land under the same conditions as Trust Land: rent-free, without any obligation to provide labour or sell crops to the estate owner, and following traditional customs. Abrahams saw these views as irreconcilable and considered that African residents in estates should be “emancipated”, free to leave the estate and be resettled on Trust Land or to stay on terms negotiated with the owner, not imposed by legislation. This could not be done while much Native Trust Land was overcrowded, so the unused and under-used estate land needed to be acquired for the re-settlement of those leaving estates and also to accommodate some of the excess population already on Trust Land. Abrahams thought that the majority of estate residents would choose to leave, so the owners could then develop the remaining largely unoccupied parts of their estates.|$|E
25|$|The {{full title}} of the {{legislation}} was “An Ordinance to Regulate the Position of Natives residing on Private Estates, (No 14 of 1928)” and it was normally called the Natives on Private Estates Ordinance, 1928. The Ordinance created a class of registered “Resident Natives”, who had entered into tenancy agreements: only these and their families {{had the right to}} live on the private estate of their tenancy for the term of their lease. Male children of residents lost the right to live on estates at 16 years old, and owners could refuse to allow the husband of a resident’s daughter to settle. Every registered tenant, except the elderly or widows, had to pay a rent which could be satisfied in cash, by labour or by giving produce to the owner. From 1928, District Rent Boards fixed maximum cash rents: most chose a rate of £1 for an 8 acre tenant’s plot although some estates charged less. The Boards also designated acceptable crops (mainly tobacco or cotton, sometimes maize) and fixed the amounts equivalent to rents. The required value of crops was between 30 and 50 shillings instead of £1 cash, particularly penalising maize to discourage tenants from this option. A Land Commission of 1903 reported that normal annual rent and Hut tax burden of tenants was six shillings, and from 1911 there was the option of providing fixed amounts of tobacco or cotton. However, estate owners expected that there tenants would work for at least two months rather than pay <b>rent</b> <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> or kind. As the demand for labour increased, owners refused to accept cash so the rent of six shillings, which remained virtually unchanged for other two decades before 1928, was purely nominal. By 1928, the value of the several months’ labour actually provided was roughly £1. The owners of estates over 10,000 acres would be allowed to expel up to 10% of their tenants in 1933 (and every five years thereafter) without showing any cause: those expelled were to be re-settled on Crown Lands. There was provision for future compulsory purchase of up to 10% of estates over 10,000 acres as a last resort, if no Crown Lands were available.|$|E

Peasants paid a land tax to the state (the taille), a 5% property tax (the vingtième). All paid a tax {{on the number of}} people in the family (capitation), depending on the status of the taxpayer (from poor to prince). Further royal and seigneurial obligations might be paid in several ways: in labor (the corvée), in kind, or, rarely, in coin. Peasants were also obligated to their landlords for: <b>rent</b> <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> (the cens), a payment related to their amount of annual production (the champart), and taxes on the use of the nobles' mills, wine-presses, and bakeries (the banalités). In good times, the taxes were burdensome; in harsh times, they were devastating. After a less-than-fulsome harvest, people would starve to death during the winter.|$|E
50|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for slumlords to buy property with little or no down payment, and also to receive <b>rent</b> <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> to avoid disclosing it for tax purposes, providing lucrative short term income. (Thus, in the U.S., slumlords would normally not participate in government-subsidized programs such as Section 8, due to the requirements to report income and keep properties well-maintained.) A slumlord may also hope that his property will eventually be purchased by government for more than it is worth as a part of urban renewal, or by investors as the neighborhood becomes gentrified. In Johannesburg, regions suffering from urban decay frequently have landlords the government believes exploit their tenants, making them stay in buildings that don't meet fire codes. In Britain, local councils deal with private landlords; without adequate scrutiny this can result in landlords being able to fill properties below rental code with subsidized tenants.|$|E

After Sanderson died, he was replaced by Captain Kincaid-Smith, who became general manager in 1931. Kincaid-Smith was able to acquire large quantities of tenants’ tobacco, as 150 pounds (about 70 kilograms) of dark-fired leaf was required to satisfy their annual rent; he also bought amounts <b>in</b> excess of <b>rents</b> <b>in</b> kind, deferring payment until the tobacco was sold.

In 1096 it passed to Arnulf de Montgomery, but returned to the Aumales in 1102, who held it until 1221. Trade initially flourished and as a result William le Gros founded the fortified town of Skipsea Brough along the ridgeway just south of the castle, probably around 1160. The town was intended to bring in valuable revenue to the earls, but would also have helped to defend the castle on its most vulnerable, overlooked side.

50|$|The {{basis of}} estate {{agriculture}} in Nyasaland {{for much of}} the colonial period was the system of thangata which, in the early colonial period, meant that African on estates had to perform agricultural labour in lieu of the rent for a plot of land on which they could grow food. At first, estates usually required two months’ labour a year from adult men, one month for rent, the second for Hut tax. However, on some estates the obligations of labour tenants were extended. The demand for estate labour declined in the 1920s, and British Central Africa Company was the first estate owner to modify thangata. The company issued seed to African tenants so that they could grow cotton or tobacco under supervision, and then sell their crops to the company at low prices. The Natives on Private Estates Ordinance 1928 formalised this arrangement by allowing landlords to receive <b>rents</b> <b>in</b> <b>cash,</b> <b>in</b> a fixed quantity of acceptable crops or by direct labour. The term thangata applied both to <b>rent</b> <b>in</b> kind, common on tobacco and cotton estates, and to the older form of labour thangata, which persisted on the tea estates that required direct labour.|$|R
25|$|Following the First World War, a Land Commission {{was set up}} in 1920 to {{determine}} how much of the land in Nyasaland should be made available for future European settlement and what existing rights of estate tenants should be preserved and what new ones given. The Commission recommended that all permanent rent-free tenancies under non-disturbance clauses should end, but that tenants-at-will should be given some security of tenure. Apart from the elderly or widows, all should pay <b>rents</b> <b>in</b> <b>cash,</b> <b>in</b> kind or by providing labour. The owners should also have the right to evict surplus tenants to stop their estates becoming overcrowded. The Colonial Office opposed abolishing rights under non-disturbance clauses without a long fixed tenancies, and a five-year term was agreed. By the time legislation was prepared in 1928, there was little demand for more plantations, as the existing estates were ending direct production in favour of marketing tenants’ produce. The legislation enacted in 1928 therefore emphasised that rents could be satisfied by delivering a fixed quantity of acceptable crops to the owner as well as by direct labour or <b>in</b> <b>cash.</b> It met some of the estate owners’ demands but also gave some protection to tenants from the worst excesses of thangata.|$|R

This freedom was further strengthened when he became lessee of the estates in 1777. Tyzenhaus energetically but somewhat hastily began numerous endeavors in agriculture, industry, and culture, mostly situated around Hrodna. In Šiauliai he attempted to create royal folwarks by taking land from serfs, demanding two days of corvée, increasing <b>rent</b> payment <b>in</b> <b>cash,</b> and adding additional duties (such as road building). Such reforms tripled Tyzenhaus' income but caused a violent peasant revolt in 1769. The rebellion was quickly suppressed; the reforms were only slightly modified. Using the additional income, Tyzenhaus rebuilt Šiauliai according to the principles of Classicism. Similar reconstruction was planned in Joniškis.|$|R
40|$|Many crop {{producers}} {{rely heavily}} on <b>rented</b> land <b>in</b> their farming operations. Crop land is typically <b>rented</b> <b>in</b> one of three ways: (1) cash rent; (2) crop share; or (3) cash/share combination. While crop share leases {{have been the most}} common method of <b>renting</b> land, interest <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> <b>rents</b> is increasing. Reasons include: 1) increased planting flexibility; 2) landowners not wanting to share the increased expenses of new tillage/cropping systems or production technologies; 3) older landowners wanting fixed income; 4) increased farm size and number of landown-ers per tenant; and 5) difficulty in prorating long-term capital investments in cer-tain technologies (e. g., precision agriculture). The rental arrangements between landowners and producers can significantly affect risk and profitability, and producers should understand those effects. For example, one study found that where cash renting is more common, land tends to change hands more often than where land is rented on a crop share basis. This publication describes cash rent leases and compares them to crop share arrangements. For more information on crop share rental see RM 5 - 13. 0...|$|R

We {{investigate the}} equilibrium housing policy of the public authority in terms of quality and quantity of publicly-provided housing both in the absence and presence of a RTB policy. We find that RTB can improve the aggregate welfare of low-income households only if the council housing quality is sufficiently low such that middle-wealth households have no incentive to exercise RTB. We also explore the welfare effects of various adjustments to the policy, in particular (i) to reduce discounts on RTB sales; (ii) to loosen restrictions on resale; (iii) to return the proceeds from RTB sales to local authorities to construct new public properties; and (iv) to replace RTB with <b>rent</b> subsidies <b>in</b> <b>cash...</b>|$|R

40|$|The paper {{revolves}} around the necessity to rid the large tenant of the lease market {{in the interest of}} the poor peasant, who yearns to lease-in a piece of land. The notion that the petty peasant is opting out of the lease market because of costliness of new technology seems unfounded. The peasant is not opting out, rather the large farmer is forcing him to withdraw from the market by appealing to the need of his lessor for secure rental receipts and by paying him <b>rent</b> <b>in</b> fixed <b>cash.</b> It is <b>in</b> the interest of the large farmer to drive out the petty cultivator from the lease market and thereby gain control over it, because mechanization of farming operations, in the context of high wages, is making heavy demands on him to expand the size of his operational holding. With the scope to enlarge the ownership holding having decreased, more because of the deterrent effect of the land ceiling laws, the large farmer has no option but to lease-in land to expand the size of holding to put his capital assets to optimum use. Large farmers may contribute to capitalist development in agriculture. But development of capitalist relations may lead to proletarianisation of large sections of the rural working classes.

40|$|Abstract: While farmers today access land {{mainly through}} administra-tive-based land distribution, {{transactions}} in rental markets {{are on the}} rise. Different rental contracts are informally arranged with varied land use and transfer rights and degree of enforcement. These contracts are often inter-locked to overcome the problem of incomplete or missing non-land factor markets. The empirical evidence is thin but shows mixed records on performance of rental markets. Transactions in rental markets provide an additional venue to access land, reduce disparity in distribution of area of land operated, correct imbalances in factor proportions at farm level, and partly substitute for missing or incomplete factor markets. However, rights to rental land are restricted and poorly enforced, and markets are localized and thinly traded. While participation in rental markets is poten-tially welfare improving, increasing scarcity of land and demands for higher rent, a fee for right to <b>rent</b> land, payment <b>in</b> <b>cash,</b> farming skills and experience, and proof of no-default are tightening conditions to acces...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the years}} {{shortly after the}} {{protectorate}} was founded in 1891, little of the land on European estates was planted, as few African workers were resident on estate lands at that time. Many of the Certificates of Claim issued to settlers contained “non-disturbance” clauses allowing these existing residents to continue to cultivate their existing fields rent-free [...] Many of the new workers who moved onto estates were so-called [...] "Anguru", migrants from Mozambique who were required to pay rent, usually satisfied by two months’ labour {{a year in the}} early years, under the system known as thangata although later many owners required a longer period of work. R S Hynde, the General Manager of Blantyre and East Africa Ltd, made an agreement with the headmen of villages on the company's estates in Cholo District under which the villagers were to give up their rights under the non-disturbance clause and become the company’s tenants, working for two months during the growing season <b>in</b> lieu of <b>rent</b> and Hut tax. If any of the villagers worked for another employer they were to pay their <b>rent</b> and taxes <b>in</b> <b>cash,</b> and those who could not work for it or pay rent were to be liable to be evicted. In 1903, the administration asked the High Court to cancel this agreement, as it contravened the non-disturbance clause.
