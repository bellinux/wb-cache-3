5|$|Burnside's {{road system}} was {{completely}} bitumenised during the 1960s and 1970s through government-sponsored <b>roadworks</b> programmes. Plans were also laid out {{to replace the}} winding and dangerous Mount Barker Road. One of these proposals was the Burnside-Crafers Highway, which was strongly supported by council; it envisaged leaving Greenhill Road once reaching Hazelwood Park. It was then to pass through Hazelwood Park and Beaumont, wind around the hills of Waterfall Gully and then go over Eagle on the Hill to meet Crafers. The Burnside Council put much effort into this proposal, widening Linden Avenue (which runs north-west to south-east) {{in preparation for the}} highway. The proposal was eventually rejected in favour of upgrading Mount Barker Road and Linden Avenue remained a huge out-of-place road running through an otherwise peaceful suburb.|$|E
40|$|AbstractRoadwork zones {{interrupt}} {{the flow of}} traffic and shall reduce road safety of motorways (autobahns), at least in specific sections. Motorways are the fastest roads in the German <b>roadwork</b> and have {{the highest level of}} safety – higher than either roads inside built-up areas or other roads outside built-up areas. Nevertheless, a total of 17, 172 accidents involving personal injury occurred on motorways in the year 2011, 1, 118 of them at <b>roadwork</b> zones. A total of 18 people were killed and 220 seriously injured. The principal aim of this research project was to find out if either <b>roadwork</b> zones on motorways are more unsafe than other motorways sections or they are specific subsections inside of <b>roadwork</b> zones or near them which are particularly unsafe. The research project consisted of an analysis of the statistics in the vicinity of all <b>roadwork</b> zones on German motorways (autobahns). Road accidents recorded by the police for a period of at least 12 months at 76 selected <b>roadwork</b> zones and a retrospective accident analysis of 12 completed motorway <b>roadwork</b> zones were macroscopic analyzed. In addition, a microscopic analysis of the accident occurrence was carried out of eight existing <b>roadwork</b> zones with a total length of 57 km and included also the analysis of the driving behavior of car and truck drivers throughout the length of the <b>roadwork</b> zones and/or in characteristic subsections in or near them. The results of the research project confirm that accidents at <b>roadwork</b> zones on motorways are generally accidents involving minor damage to property. The accident severity (fatalities per 1, 000 accidents involving personal injury) of accidents that occur on sections of motorway without <b>roadwork</b> zones is up to 1. 6 times higher than that of accidents that occur at <b>roadwork</b> zones. The study shows different accident rates and accident cost rates for some characteristic subsections along the <b>roadwork</b> site. Nevertheless, there are problem areas in terms of road safety, particularly {{at the beginning and end}} of <b>roadwork</b> zones, lane realignment points, carriageway changeover points and temporary slip roads. These characteristic subsections of <b>roadwork</b> zones have an influence on the road safety. The same applies to the impact of how the traffic is routed, the length of the <b>roadwork</b> site or specific road equipment (e. g. road signs against a yellow background) ...|$|R

Long's supporters presented them {{in the form of}} a royal edict on wooden blocks, declaring their intention to attack French military installations. They called on the people to rise up and topple French rule and said that supernatural forces would aid the independence fighters, saying that an unnamed monk would arrive from the mountains to lead them. At the time, southern Vietnam was beset by heavy corvée labour demands, especially with large-scale <b>roadworks</b> in progress. This meant that the peasants had less time to tend to their farmland, and revolts and strikes had been common. The simmering discontent is seen as a reason for Long's ability to gather such levels of support in a short time. Long's supporters called on merchants to flee and convert their colonial bank notes into solid copper cash. Word of the planned revolt spread quickly, leading to a substantial depreciation in the currency.|$|E

25|$|Graves in {{the central}} section of the {{cemetery}} were sporadically discovered between 1839 and 1964, as a road was built and enlarged {{through the middle of}} it. The likely first discovery of skeletons at the site was in 1839, when the Sevenoaks Turnpike Road was diverted, which would have entailed digging at the site; no burials were recorded, although an oral tradition of skeletons and weapons being discovered survived through to the 1930s, when it was recorded by Gordon Ward. In June 1956 the A26 underwent <b>roadworks,</b> resulting in the discovery of 13 further graves. In 1956 and 1958, the Otford Historical Society began an excavation nearby, in the hope of discovering more of the cemetery, but they missed the burial area, discovering nothing. In August 1959, another road improvement revealed 3 further graves {{on the west side of}} the bank, while in November 1959 and January 1960, schoolboys digging into the chalk uncovered two more. A further grave was discovered around 1963 by workmen building a small reservoir; this burial was not recorded.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} capacity reduction in connection with <b>roadwork.</b> The paper presents a state-of-the-art description on <b>roadwork</b> effects on capacity. The state-of-the art {{has been used to}} develop a model for estimation of capacity reduction at <b>roadwork</b> zone on Swedish roads. The model has partly been validated with empirical data from a full scale test at the freeway network in Gothenburg. The studies presented in the literature shows that capacity differs not only between different <b>roadwork</b> designs but also between <b>roadwork</b> with similar design. Thus, one can conclude that there is a high variation between the <b>roadwork</b> zone due to effects of surrounding elements, such as the type of work and external effects such as rain (which affects the capacity even under normal conditions). The differences that exist in the estimation of capacity for motorway sections next to a <b>roadwork</b> zone can be said to consist of four situation-specific variables. These four variables are: the percentage of heavy vehicles, type of road, the width of the remaining lanes and diversion of traffic to the opposite carriageway. An increasing proportion of heavy vehicles {{have a negative impact on}} <b>roadwork</b> zone capacity. An increasing complexity of work, from light barrier works to extensive bridge repair, has a negative impact on performance. An increased lane width has a positive effect on capacity. The diversion of traffic to the opposite carriageway is often the cause of the bottleneck and therefore has a significance effect on capacity. The conclusion from the literature review is that the most important parameters that should be incorporated in a Swedish capacity manual for the operation and maintenance of <b>roadwork</b> are: the proportion of heavy traffic, lane width, type of <b>roadwork,</b> number of closed lanes, closed road shoulder, proportion of commuter traffic and length of <b>roadwork</b> zone. In general, there have been (too) few empirical studies focusing on the differences in capacity caused by these situation-specific variables. The paper presents a comparison between the Dutch model for computation of capacity reduction and a composite model of reduction factors from Germany, USA and Denmark. The comparison show that the two models essentially gives the same results. Based on these results a new model was developed. In the developed model, the capacity for the remaining lane is calculated. The paper presents results from a field study in Gothenburg where throughput was measured in three cases during a morning hour and one afternoon hour. The capacity was calculated from the normal site conditions according to historical traffic flow and speed data. The result shows that the empirically estimated confidence interval of capacity reduction is consistent with the reduction calculated with the new model for the different cases. The conclusion is that the model can be used to calculate capacity reductions for different <b>roadwork</b> zone configurations but that validation for more configurations is desirable...|$|R
