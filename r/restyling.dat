5|$|By this time, however, St Briavels Castle {{had been}} in a slow period of decline for many years, similar to that of several other royal castles in the region, {{including}} Bristol and Gloucester. Minor improvements were made, including various light windows added to the internal buildings in the 15th century, and extensive <b>restyling</b> of the chapel in the 17th century, but not to the extent of those castles successfully converted to more luxurious dwellings.|$|E
5|$|Sweet Kisses, {{which was}} aimed at an older audience, did not perform well commercially, and so Simpson re-evaluated her career. At the {{suggestion}} of her label executives, Simpson modified her image and sound in Irresistible, deciding to delve more into the teen pop and R genres, as she felt that <b>restyling</b> herself to match {{the image of her}} contemporaries—Spears and Christina Aguilera—would help rejuvenate her career. After its release, Irresistible received mostly negative reviews from critics, most of whom were disappointed by the music; some of them also felt it was too generic and over-produced. Initially, the album enjoyed commercial success, debuting at number six on the US Billboard 200. It was an improvement from her previous endeavor and the album went on to sell about 850,000copies in the United States, and over two million worldwide. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 500,000copies. Elsewhere, the album was not as successful, reaching number thirteen in Canada and cracking the top forty in Sweden, Japan and Germany.|$|E
25|$|The XV50 Camry was {{produced}} from 21 August 2011, introduced on 23 August 2011, and began U.S. sales in September 2011. The interior received a major <b>restyling,</b> while the exterior received all-new sheet metal and more angular styling.|$|E

25|$|There was a {{complete}} <b>restyling</b> for 1959, {{but this time the}} names of the various series were changed. Not until 1991 would there again be a big Buick known as the Roadmaster; the largest Buick models were renamed the Electra.|$|E
25|$|Boléro epitomises Ravel's {{preoccupation with}} <b>restyling</b> and reinventing dance movements. It {{was also one}} of the last pieces he {{composed}} before illness forced him into retirement. The two piano concertos and the song cycle Don Quichotte à Dulcinée were the only completed compositions that followed Boléro.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, NABI {{unveiled}} new styling for its metal-structured low-floor {{product and}} its CompoBus. <b>Restyling</b> of both products was accomplished primarily {{by using a}} redesigned front mask, leaving the body structure unchanged from earlier {{versions of the same}} models. Also, a 40-foot CompoBus prototype incorporating the new styling was also produced.|$|E

25|$|Suzuki lightly {{revised the}} GSX1300R for the 2008 model year, {{with a minor}} <b>restyling</b> of the bodywork, and {{fine-tuning}} of the engine's head, pistons and exhaust. Though the engine changes were relatively limited, they still yielded a large horsepower increase, and brought the bike into compliance with new noise and emissions requirements.|$|E
25|$|In {{comparison}} to the Polo Mk4, the Polo Vivo has a restyled front bumper and grille, deleted scuff strips on the bumpers and sides of the car, and side indicators relocated from the wing mirrors to the front fenders.

25|$|Named to honour the company's twenty-fifth anniversary, in 1988, the 25th Anniversary Countach, {{although}} mechanically {{very similar}} to the 5000QV, sported considerable <b>restyling.</b> Notably, <b>restyling,</b> enlargement and extension of the rear 'air-box' intake-ducts was among other refinements undertaken (extending them to a more gradual incline further in-keeping with aerodynamic-streamlining), while the secondary pair of debossed ducts, originally situated further behind them, were brought forward and relocated directly on top, encompassing refashioned fins now running longitudinally rather than transversely, this allowed the airboxes, located behind the radiators to be rotated from a transverse to a longitudinal position, allowing better airflow from the radiators out through the secondary fins. Additionally, further reconstruction of an already modified engine-bay cover, from a concept consisting of dual-raised sections and tri-ducting, to one that embodies a centre-raised section incorporating dual-ducting become another feature. Various redevelopments to the rear-end were made; most notably the introduction of a rear bumper extending outwardly from the lower-portion.|$|E
25|$|The second {{generation}} RX-7 ("FC", VIN begins JM1FC3 or JMZFC1), still {{known as the}} Mazda Savanna RX-7 in Japan, featured a complete <b>restyling</b> reminiscent of the Porsche 924. Mazda's stylists, led by Chief Project Engineer Akio Uchiyama, focused on the Porsche 924 for their inspiration in designing the FC because the new car was being styled primarily for the American market, {{where the majority of}} first generation RX-7s had been sold.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, the GT {{received}} a <b>restyling.</b> Outside there were new one-piece tail lights, grey plastic bumpers, C-pillar vents and side skirts; all bright stainless steel {{save for the}} Alfa Romeo triangular grille was changed to matte-black trim. The 1.6-litre version was discontinued and the Alfetta GTV became known simply as Alfa Romeo GTV2.0; the Alfetta name was dropped, but the two-litre coupé retained its type designation of 11636 for left-hand drive and 11637 for right-hand drive. 15-inch disc-shaped alloy wheels were now standard, {{as opposed to the}} earlier cars' 14-inch pressed steel or optional 14-inch alloy.|$|E

5000|$|Along {{with the}} Mégane hatchback, the Scénic {{underwent}} a minor frontal <b>restyle</b> in 1999 and the newer 16-valve engines introduced. The front end {{was quite a}} bit different from the Mégane counterpart, and there were also redesigned rear lights. From {{the time of this}} <b>restyle,</b> it became officially known as the Renault Scénic, although a small [...] "Mégane" [...] badge still appeared on the rear door signifying the car's origin. This model was built in Brazil with flexible fuel engines.|$|R
25|$|The 1967 models {{received}} {{nothing more}} than a touch-up after a <b>restyling</b> for 1966. All Novas got a crosshatch pattern that filled the deck lid trim panel. The Nova officially was still called the Chevy II Nova and had overtaken the bottom-rung Chevy II 100 in sales. The Chevy II 100 lacked {{much in the way of}} trim or brightwork. 1967 models carried significant improvements in the area of safety equipment. A government-mandated energy-absorbing steering column and safety steering wheel, soft interior parts such as armrests and sun visors, recessed instrument panel knobs, and front shoulder belt anchors, were included in all 1967 models.|$|E
25|$|The 1987 models {{saw only}} minor styling {{revisions}} after the <b>restyling</b> {{of the previous}} year. All models came equipped with new modern composite headlights and a stand-up hood ornament returned. A woodgrain appliqué was used on the dashboards for all models. The model line-up was slightly revised, and now included a base level Caprice eight-passenger wagon, and a Caprice Classic Brougham LS four-door sedan. The Brougham LS featured all the Brougham amenities, plus a padded vinyl roof, opera lights and LS monograms. Leather upholstery was a new available option for Brougham and Brougham LS sedans, which also had a new pillow-style seating design and a folding center armrest in the back seat.|$|E
25|$|Since the race's <b>restyling</b> in 2012, the climbs of Oude Kwaremont, Paterberg and Koppenberg, {{just south}} of Oudenaarde, are {{the heart of the}} action. The Kwaremont is a long section of cobbles that starts sharply before {{gradually}} levelling out. It is the site where powerful riders often make the race-winning move, as Fabian Cancellara demonstrated in 2013, when he attacked with Peter Sagan on the lower slopes of Kwaremont before distancing the Slovak on the Paterberg. The Paterberg is the final climb of the day where fans create a carnival-like atmosphere. It is a short but cobbled climb and viciously steep. After 245km of racing, it is generally an ultimate test of endurance and strength.|$|E

500|$|... "Sexy! No No No..." [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. John Lucas of Allmusic described the [...] "pounding electro-punk number" [...] as [...] "one {{of the most}} daring songs they've yet released," [...] while a reviewer for Newsround deemed it [...] "yet another sample of their perfect pop: bold, sassy, slightly loopy and unbelievably catchy." [...] Fraser McAlpine of BBC thought that [...] "Sexy! No No No..." [...] is [...] "kinda dumb, kinda sassy, kinda pumping and kinda 'what on EARTH is THAT?', {{just like all the}} best Aloud anthems are", while Nick Levine of Digital Spy rated it four out of five stars, noting that Xenomania sacrificed the [...] "conventional song structure in the name of keeping those hooks coming thick and fast - and quite right too." [...] Levine also praised Girls Aloud for <b>restyling</b> themselves [...] "as teasing minxes, claiming that they've 'dropped their d-d-dirty style'". Lauren Murphy of Entertainment.ie said that [...] "Sexy! No No No..."

500|$|She {{moved into}} the teen-pop genre, as she felt that <b>restyling</b> herself to match the image of Spears and Aguilera would help remake her career. She {{separated}} from her then-boyfriend Nick Lachey, in March 2001, feeling the need to concentrate on her career. Her new image was promoted through appearances on many events, where Simpson wore revealing outfits. The development of this image coincided with the production and release of her second studio effort, Irresistible. Simpson said {{that she wanted to}} portray a [...] "sexier, more mature style" [...] in her new album. [...] "I recorded Sweet Kisses when I was 17 years old and I'm 21 [...] so there is four years of growth involved," [...] Simpson {{said in an interview with}} Coventry Newspapers in July 2001. In an interview with Cosmopolitan in June 2001, she explained, [...] "This record is about who I am now. The music is edgier, and I'm all grown up." [...] According to Terri Doughtery, author of People in the News: Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey, Simpson hoped her new image would bring more attention to the power of her voice. [...] "It's not just me singing about being in love. I also have heartbreak songs and girls telling off guys songs. It's going to take me a while to recoup [...] this album, because we spent a lot of money on it," [...] Simpson said to Entertainment Weekly.|$|E
