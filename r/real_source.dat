5|$|Before {{the latter}} half of the 18th century, grain, timber and then coal were Plymouth's main imports. During this time the <b>real</b> <b>source</b> of wealth was from the {{neighbouring}} town of Plymouth Dock (renamed in 1824 to Devonport) and the major employer in the entire region was the dockyard. The Three Towns conurbation of Plymouth, Stonehouse and Devonport enjoyed some prosperity during the late 18th and early 19th century and were enriched by a series of neo-classical urban developments designed by London architect John Foulston. Foulston was important for both Devonport and Plymouth and was responsible for several grand public buildings, many now destroyed, including the Athenaeum, the Theatre Royal and Royal Hotel, and much of Union Street.|$|E

25|$|Caution is {{required}} in describing structures on a cosmic scale because things are often different from how they appear. Gravitational lensing (bending of light by gravitation) can make an image appear to originate {{in a different direction}} from its <b>real</b> <b>source.</b> This is caused when foreground objects (such as galaxies) curve surrounding spacetime (as predicted by general relativity), and deflect passing light rays. Rather usefully, strong gravitational lensing can sometimes magnify distant galaxies, making them easier to detect. Weak lensing (gravitational shear) by the intervening universe in general also subtly changes the observed large-scale structure. As of 2004, measurements of this subtle shear showed considerable promise as a test of cosmological models.|$|E

500|$|The Third Test at the Adelaide Oval proved pivotal. There {{were angry}} crowd scenes after the Australian captain Bill Woodfull and wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield {{were hit by}} bouncers. An apologetic Plum Warner entered the Australian {{dressing}} room and was rebuked by Woodfull. Woodfull's remarks (that [...] "...there are two teams out there and {{only one of them}} is playing cricket") were leaked to the press, and Warner and others attributed this to Australian opening batsman Jack Fingleton, however for many years (even after Fingleton's death) a bitter war of accusation passed between Fingleton and Bradman as to who was the <b>real</b> <b>source</b> of the leak. In a cable to the MCC, the Australian Board of Control repeated the allegation of poor sportsmanship directed at Warner by Woodfull. With the support of the MCC, England continued with Bodyline despite Australian protests. The tourists won the last three Tests convincingly and regained the Ashes. Bradman caused controversy with his own tactics. Always seeking to score, and with the leg side packed with fielders, he often backed away and hit the ball into the vacant half of the outfield with unorthodox shots reminiscent of tennis or golf. This brought him 396 runs (at 56.57) for the series and plaudits for attempting to find a solution to Bodyline, although his series average was just 57% of his career mean. Jack Fingleton was in no doubt that Bradman's game altered irrevocably as a consequence of Bodyline, writing: ...|$|E

40|$|Presented at 2 nd International Conference on Auditory Display (ICAD), Santa Fe, New Mexico, November 7 - 9, 1994. In {{most of our}} {{research}} we produce virtual sound sources by filtering stimuli with head-related transfer functions (HRTF's) measured from discrete source positions and present the stimuli to listeners via headphones. With this synthesis procedure head movements create {{no change in the}} acoustical stimullus at the two ears, in contrast with what happens in natural listening conditions. To compare the localizability of virtual and <b>real</b> <b>sources</b> under these conditions, we require that listeners not m their heads, even when localizing <b>real</b> <b>sources.</b> Some listeners make large numbers of localization errors known as "front-back confusions" (a report of an apparent position in the front hemifield given a rear hemifield stimulus, and vice-versa). Head movements can, in theory, provide the cues needed to resolve front-back ambiguities. The experiment described here seeks to clarify the issue by meassuring both the nature and consequences of head movements during a sound localization task...|$|R
40|$|In marine {{acquisition}} both {{a direct}} wavefield and a ghost wavefield are produced {{as well as}} recorded. Hence, the seismic data can {{be considered to be}} a natural blend of four wavefields related to the <b>real</b> <b>sources,</b> ghost <b>sources,</b> <b>real</b> detectors and ghost detectors respectively. We consider deghosting to be deblending ('echo-deblending'), leading to a non-causal, full-wavefield algorithm, characterized by utilizing the ghost. Therefore, echo-deblending is different from prediction-error solutions that aim at removing the ghost. Echo-deblending is independent of the subsurface complexity; only what happens at and near the surface is relevant. Depending on the sea state, the reflection coefficient is frequency dependent. Moreover, the water velocity varies due to variations in temperature, salinity and pressure. We propose to measure such parameters and/or estimate them from the data. The output of our method consists of four ghost-free records: one due to <b>real</b> <b>sources</b> at the actual location below the water level (+zs), one due to ghost source at the mirrored location above the water level (-zs), both being recorded by real detectors at (+zd) and by ghost detectors at (-zd). Optionally, these four records are transformed to one record at a common source-receiver datum (z 0) ...|$|R
