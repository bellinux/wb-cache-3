50|$|In {{the gold}} {{standard}} and the Bretton Woods system, the major developed countries mainly implemented fixed exchange <b>rate</b> <b>systems.</b> Due to the devaluation of the pound around the 1970s {{and the collapse of}} the Bretton Woods system, many developed countries switched to floating exchange rates. In 1971, France started to adopt the dual exchange <b>rate</b> <b>system.</b> After that, in 1973, Italy also adopted this system. Both countries maintained these dual exchange <b>rate</b> <b>systems</b> through the early 1970s. The Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union has been using this system since the early 1990s. Around the same time, many Latin American countries also shifted from a single exchange <b>rate</b> <b>system</b> to a dual exchange <b>rate</b> <b>system</b> or a multiple exchange <b>rate</b> <b>system.</b> With the structural adjustment to international trade that has occurred since the mid-1980s, especially the deepening of trade reform, Latin American countries have begun gradually abandoning multiple exchange <b>rate</b> <b>systems,</b> favoring instead the implementation of single exchange <b>rate</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R

5|$|To {{counteract}} these increasing {{complaints and}} attempts at legislation, {{the video game}} industry in the United States created the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) in 1994. This was prompted by a 1993 congressional hearing over {{the violence in the}} video game Mortal Kombat and lack of consistent content ratings between publishers, with Congress threatening to pass legislation that would mandate a ratings system if the industry did not take its own steps. The industry reacted by forming the Interactive Digital Software Association, which would become the ESA, and establishing the ESRB. The ESRB, like the Motion Picture Association of America's rating system, is a voluntary and self-regulated body that examines the content of video games as provided by the publisher before distribution, and given a rating describing the content within, generally classified from being all ages-appropriate to adult audiences only. Video game distributors are similarly bound by voluntary compliance to check the age of the purchaser against the rating of the game to prevent the sale of mature titles to younger players. Most stores prevent the sale of unrated games, so virtually every video game sold at retail in the United States is rated by the ESRB. Attempts have been made to mandate the ratings system; the Family Entertainment Protection Act, a 2005 bill introduced into the U.S. Congress by Senators Hillary Clinton, Joseph Lieberman, and Evan Bayh, would have made ESRB participation mandatory with oversight by the Federal Trade Commission, and introduced fines for selling Mature or Adult-Only content to minors. The bill, however, did not clear the Senate. Though the ESRB met criticism in 2000–2005 for the ease of access of mature-rated games to minors, the Board has improved its efforts to enforce the ratings system at retailers. A 2011 report issued by the Federal Trade Commission found that the voluntary controls by the ESRB had the highest success rate of any media industry, preventing sales of mature titles to minors 87% of the time. Similar content <b>rating</b> <b>systems</b> exist in other countries, including the British Board of Film Classification, the Australian Classification Board, and Japan's Computer Entertainment Rating Organization.|$|E
25|$|With the {{invention}} of calculators and computers, it has become easy to calculate a rating for players {{based on the results}} of their games.

40|$|This paper investigates empirically the {{differences}} in time?series behavior of key economic aggregates under alternative exchange <b>rate</b> <b>systems.</b> We use a postwar sample of 49 countries to compare the behavior of output. consumption, trade flows, government consumption spending, and real exchange rates under alternative exchange <b>rate</b> <b>systems</b> (pegged, floating, and systems such as the EMS). We then examine evidence from two particular episodes, involving Canada and Ireland, {{of changes in the}} exchange <b>rate</b> <b>system.</b> Aside from greater variability of real exchange rates under flexible than under pegged nominal exchange <b>rate</b> <b>systems,</b> we find little evidence of systematic differences in the behavior of other macroeconomic aggregates or international trade flows under alternative exchange <b>rate</b> <b>systems.</b> These results are of interest because a large class of theoretical models implies that the nominal exchange <b>rate</b> <b>system</b> has important effects on a number of macroeconomic quantities. ...|$|R
