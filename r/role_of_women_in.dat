5|$|Female taiko {{performance}} has {{also served as}} a response to gendered stereotypes of Japanese women as being quiet, subservient, or a femme fatale. Through performance, some groups believe they are helping to redefine not only the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> taiko, but how women are perceived more generally.|$|E
5|$|The concerto delle donne {{revolutionized}} the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> professional music, and continued {{the tradition of}} the Este court as a musical center. Word of the ladies' ensemble spread across Italy, inspiring imitations in the powerful courts of the Medici and Orsini. The founding of the concerto delle donne was the most important event in secular Italian music in the late sixteenth century; the musical innovations established in the court were important {{in the development of the}} madrigal, and eventually the seconda pratica.|$|E

5|$|The meeting {{comprised}} six sessions {{including a}} lecture on law, a humorous presentation, and multiple discussions about the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> society. Stanton and the Quaker women presented two prepared documents, the Declaration of Sentiments and an accompanying list of resolutions, to be debated and modified before being put forward for signatures. A heated debate sprang up regarding women's right to vote, with many – including Mott – urging the removal of this concept, but Frederick Douglass, who was the convention's sole African American attendee, argued eloquently for its inclusion, and the suffrage resolution was retained. Exactly 100 of approximately 300 attendees signed the document, mostly women.|$|E
5|$|By 1922, {{the display}} of unity by white farmers against {{chartered}} rule at the 1920 elections fell apart. The majority of them, mostly ranchers and tobacco planters, who relied on the southern market, voted for Union. On the other hand, Mashonaland maize growers, wanting to retain full share of the local produce markets, wanted responsible government. The 1922 referendum results were 8,774 for responsible government and 5,989 for joining South Africa. The <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> {{the defeat of the}} Unionists was substantial, with approximately 75% of them voting for responsible government, even when their husbands voted for Union. In a letter to the South African Prime Minister Jan Smuts, the Company Administrator Sir Francis Drummond Chaplin cited anti-Afrikaner sentiments, particularly amongst women, as {{a major factor in the}} result.|$|E
5|$|Literature in Virginia often {{deals with}} the state's {{extensive}} and sometimes troubled past. The works of Pulitzer Prize winner Ellen Glasgow often dealt with social inequalities and the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> her culture. Glasgow's peer and close friend James Branch Cabell wrote extensively about the changing position of gentry in the Reconstruction era, and challenged its moral code with Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice. William Styron approached history in works such as The Confessions of Nat Turner and Sophie's Choice. Tom Wolfe has occasionally dealt with his southern heritage in bestsellers like I Am Charlotte Simmons. Mount Vernon native Matt Bondurant received critical acclaim for his historic novel The Wettest County in the World about moonshiners in Franklin County during prohibition. Virginia also names a state Poet Laureate.|$|E

5|$|The <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> the Fasci siciliani was substantial, but is {{regularly}} overlooked in historical accounts. Women were {{often at the}} forefront of demonstrations and strikes, speaking in public meetings and conferences. During municipal elections they made sure that men were going to vote (women did {{not have the right to}} vote at the time). They patrolled the taverns to prevent the men from betraying the duty of militancy with bottles of wine. They also took care of many organizational aspects and were particularly active in proselytizing for the movement, decorating the stage of the rallies, preparing ceremonies such as the inauguration opening of the flag of the Fasci, and welcoming the leaders who came to the towns with flowers.|$|E
5|$|The war {{affected}} Australia in many ways, although arguably not as greatly {{as it did}} {{the many}} European nations that were more directly involved. Economically the war {{had a number of}} significant impacts, although the Great Depression would later prove far more significant and Australian industry was not as greatly transformed as it would be following World War II. The political landscape was also transformed due to the rifts that resulted from the issue of conscription, while to a smaller extent the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> society also evolved as more women entered the workforce. Indeed, between 1914 and 1918 there had been a 13 per cent increase in the employment of women; however, this was mainly in areas were women were traditionally employed. Equally, although around 2,000 women were employed as nurses in the AIF, there was no great involvement of women in the military during the war.|$|E
