40|$|Trussed beam {{with the}} 46 m span was {{considered}} {{as an object}} of investigations. Pultrusion composite profiles and steel cables were considered as the materials of the trussed beam top chord, web and bottom chord, correspondingly. Trussed beam <b>with</b> <b>strut</b> frames, trussed beam with triangular web and trussed beam <b>with</b> vertical <b>struts</b> were compared {{from the point of view}} of maximum vertical displacements. The trussed beam <b>with</b> vertical <b>struts</b> is characterized by the increased deformability in case if the load is uniformly distributed by the half of the span. It was shown, that the application of additional diagonals allows to decrease the deformability of trussed beam <b>with</b> vertical <b>struts.</b> The dependence of load-bearing capacity on construction height and material consumption was obtained for the trussed beam <b>with</b> vertical <b>struts</b> <b>with</b> the 46 m span. It was shown, that load-bearing capacity of trussed beam changes within the limits from 11. 4 to 26. 1 kN/m when the height of the trussed beam changes from 3 to 7 m, correspondingly. The materials consumption changes within the limits from 1705 to 2516 kg at the same time...|$|R
