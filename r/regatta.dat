5|$|Elias C. Laycock was his 'chief rival'. Just a year {{younger than}} Rush, and like him, a large and {{powerful}} man, Laycock came {{to live on the}} Lower Clarence River around 1874.

Laycock beat Rush again and again, but Trickett eventually beat Laycock.

5|$|Rush set {{his sights}} on the Australian Sculling Championship, and in February 1873, won it from William Hickey in a {{controversial}} match: many claimed that Hickey 'sold' the race. Rush insisted that the championship be contested on his home waters of the Clarence River. To make this condition was his right as the holder of a current championship. Rush's enterprise in arranging for sponsors to provide substantial sums of prizes encouraged Australia's best scullers to compete. These events drew large crowds of spectators and gamblers to the Clarence River, especially the town of Grafton. Rush helped to organise, and took part in, aquatic contests held Grafton in 1874, and 1875 Two of these were held in conjunction with Grafton's celebration of the Queen's Birthday.
