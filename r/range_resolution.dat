25|$|Shot {{noise is}} {{produced}} by electrons in transit across a discontinuity, which occurs in all detectors. Shot noise is the dominant source in most receivers. There will also be flicker noise caused by electron transit through amplification devices, which is reduced using heterodyne amplification. Another reason for heterodyne processing is that for fixed fractional bandwidth, the instantaneous bandwidth increases linearly in frequency. This allows improved <b>range</b> <b>resolution.</b> The one notable exception to heterodyne (downconversion) radar systems is ultra-wideband radar. Here a single cycle, or transient wave, is used similar to UWB communications, see List of UWB channels.|$|E
500|$|Targets {{picked out}} by the ZAR were then {{illuminated}} by the Zeus Discrimination Radar (ZDR, also known as Decoy Discrimination Radar, DDR or DR). ZDR imaged the entire cloud using a chirped signal that allowed the receiver to accurately determine range within the cloud by passing each frequency in the chirp to a separate range gate. The <b>range</b> <b>resolution</b> was 0.25 microseconds, about [...] As the signal was spread out over the entire cloud, {{it had to be}} very powerful; the ZDR produced 40MW 2µs pulses in the L-band between 1270–1400MHz. To ensure no signal was lost by scanning areas that were empty, the ZDR used a Cassegrain reflector that could be moved to focus the beam as the cloud approached to keep the area under observation constant.|$|E

2500|$|Although the {{sidelobe}} {{level has}} been much reduced, there are some undesirable consequences of the weighting process. [...] Firstly, there is an overall loss of gain, with the peak amplitude of the main lobe reduced by about 5.4dB and, secondly, the half-power beam width of the main pulse has increased by nearly 50%. [...] In, say, a radar system, these effects would cause loss of range and reduced <b>range</b> <b>resolution,</b> respectively.|$|E
2500|$|The chirp pulse {{compression}} process transforms {{a long duration}} frequency-coded pulse into a narrow pulse of greatly increased amplitude. [...] It is a technique used in radar and sonar systems {{because it is a}} method whereby a narrow pulse with high peak power can be derived from a long duration pulse with low peak power. [...] Furthermore, the process offers good <b>range</b> <b>resolution</b> because the half-power beam width of the compressed pulse is consistent with the system bandwidth.|$|E

2500|$|The sinc {{characteristic}} of a compressed pulse is {{a direct consequence of}} the spectrum of the linear chirp pulse having a rectangular profile. [...] By modifying the spectrum to have a bell-shaped profile, by means of a weighting (or windowing, or apodization) function, lower level sidelobes are obtained. [...] When windowing is implemented, some signal attenuation occurs and there is a broadening of the main pulse, so both signal-to-noise ratio and <b>range</b> <b>resolution</b> are impaired by the process. [...] Preferably, the transmitted and received pulses should be modified in equal measure, but when this is impractical, windowing in the compression filter alone is still beneficial.|$|E
