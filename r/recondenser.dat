40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the design of}} a novel boil-off gas (BOG) re-liquefaction technology using a BOG <b>recondenser</b> system. The BOG <b>recondenser</b> system targets the liquefied natural gas (LNG) bunkering operation, in which the BOG phase transition occurs in a pressure vessel instead of a heat exchanger. The BOG that is generated during LNG bunkering operation is characterized as an intermittent flow with various peak loads. The system was designed to temporarily store the transient BOG inflow, condense it with subcooled LNG and store the condensed liquid. The superiority of the system was verified by comparing it with the most extensively employed conventional re-liquefaction system in terms of consumption energy and via an exergy analysis. Static simulations were conducted for three compositions; the results indicated that the proposed system provided 0 to 6. 9 % higher efficiencies. The exergy analysis indicates that the useful work of the conventional system is 24. 9 %, and the useful work of the proposed system is 26. 0 %. Process dynamic simulations of six cases were also performed to verify the behaviour of the BOG <b>recondenser</b> system. The results show that the pressure of the holdup in the <b>recondenser</b> vessel increased during the BOG inflow mode and decreased during the initialization mode. The maximum pressure of one of the bunkering cases was 3. 45 bar. The system encountered a challenge during repetitive operations due to overpressurizing of the BOG <b>recondenser</b> vessel...|$|E
40|$|The {{staff of}} the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) has {{prepared}} an environmental assessment (EA) on the liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities proposed by Southern LNG, Inc. (Southern LNG) in the above-referenced docket. The EA was prepared {{to satisfy the requirements}} of the National Environmental Policy Act. The staff concludes that approval of the proposed project, with appropriate mitigating measures, would not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The EA assesses the potential environmental effects of the proposed project which includes expansion of the existing Elba Island LNG import terminal in Chatham County, Georgia. Southern LNG proposes to: construct an LNG unloading slip cut into Elba Island with two ship unloading docks; construct a 1, 000, 000 -barrel double walled LNG storage tank; construct two boil-off gas compressors; construct two first-stage (booster) LNG pumps; construct a <b>recondenser</b> vessel; construct three second-stage LNG pumps; construct three submerged combustion vaporizers; and construct a motor control center. The proposed facilities would expand the storage and sendout capacity of Southern LNG's existing LNG import terminal in Chatham County, Georgia. The proposal would: 1) expand the storage capacity of the terminal; and 2) increase the sustainable daily sendout capability to 806 million standard cubic feet per day (MMscf/d) and its peaking capacity to 1, 2 15 MMscf/d. Southern LNG seeks import authorization in Docket No. CPO 2 - 379 - 000. The EA has been placed in the public files of the FERC. A limited number o...|$|E
40|$|Cryocoolers {{are closed}} cycle devices which produce cooling below 120 K. Usually, {{one or two}} linear motors are used to drive one pulse tube cryocooler. Cryocoolers are used for various {{applications}} like, cooling of infra red detectors, cryo surgical knife, cryogen <b>recondenser</b> etc. In this thesis the design development and testing of Twin Pulse Tube Cryocooler (TPTC) are discussed. TPTC consists of two pulse tubes driven by dual piston head linear compressor. This dual piston linear compressor is operated using single linear motor. Using this configuration, cooling power is doubled with reduced cost of compressor. The design, fabrication and testing of Linear Moving Magnet Synchronous Motor (LMMSM) based dual piston head linear compressor are carried out indigenously. Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis is used for estimating eddy current loss and flux distribution pattern in various mover configurations of the linear motor. The developed fabrication and assembly procedure of linear motor are discussed in detail. The mover of linear motor is supported by using a pair of cross armed C – type flexures. These flexures are designed using FEM and are fabricated indigenously. The flexure pairs are tested for 108 cycles with ± 3 mm stroke length of linear motor before assembling compressor. Linear motor is usually required to be operated at different frequencies. Thus, a variable frequency and variable voltage Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) based power supply is designed using analog circuits like Op-Amps. This cost effective power supply is capable of delivering 27 A at 100 V with frequency range of 25 Hz to 80 Hz continuously. Sage software was used to carry out 1 -D simulation and obtain dimensions of various Pulse Tube Cryocooler (PTC) components. Various pulse tube configurations like Joint Twin PTC, Twin PTC with buffer volume and single PTC with buffer volume were carried out. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Fluent 2 -D analysis was carried out for single PTC with buffer volume. The fabrication and assembly procedure of PTC is discussed in detail. A novel method of heat exchanger fabrication was developed and analyzed using FEM and its performance is tested experimentally. The twin PTC is operated at 34 bar and 48 Hz. A light weight High Temperature Superconductor (HTS) based level sensor is developed to monitor the cryogen level. The developed sensor was calibrated against discrete diode array and pre-calibrated continuous capacitance type level sensor. The calibrations were carried out in indigenously designed and fabricated 4 -wall cryostat using Liquid Nitrogen (LN 2) and LOX as cryogen. LabVIEW software based data acquisition was designed for testing, recording and monitoring the performance of twin PTC and level sensors during experiments...|$|E

40|$|Ices, {{including}} water ice, {{prefer to}} <b>recondense</b> onto pre-existing nuclei rather than spontaneously forming grains from {{a cloud of}} vapor. Interestingly, different potential recondensation nuclei have very different propensities to actually nucleate water ice at the temperatures associated with freeze-out in protoplanetary discs. Therefore, if a region in a disc is warmed and then recooled, water vapor should {{not be expected to}} refreeze evenly onto all available grains. Instead it will preferentially <b>recondense</b> onto the most favorable grains. When the recooling is slow enough, only the most favorable grains will nucleate ice, allowing them to <b>recondense</b> thick ice mantles. We quantify the conditions for preferential recondensation to rapidly create pebble-sized grains in protoplanetary discs and show that FU Orionis type outbursts have the appropriate cooling rates to drive pebble creation in a band about 5 astronomical units wide outside of the quiescent frost line from approximately Jupiter's orbit to Saturn's (about 4 to 10 au). Those pebbles could be of the appropriate size to proceed to planetesimal formation via the Streaming Instability, or to contribute to the growth of planetesimals through pebble accretion. We suggest that this phenomenon contributed to the formation of the gas giants in our own Solar System. Comment: 5 pages, Accepted for publication, MNRA...|$|R

The impact of the severity of the treatment and {{of the nature of the}} acid catalyst on the recovered lignin structure was investigated. The lignins isolated at high severity were highly <b>recondensed</b> and partly composed of regular structures composed of furan-like rings. The alfa (Stipa tenacissima L.) organosolv lignins were used for the preparation of formaldehyde-free adhesives which were characterized by TMA and used for the preparation of particleboard without any addition of synthetic resin. It has been demonstrated for the first time that: (1) the addition of 10 % to 30 % of organosolv alfa lignin in a tannin-based adhesive improved the adhesive performance; and (2) the conditions of the lignin extraction strongly impact the lignin-based adhesive performances. The highly <b>recondensed</b> lignin extracted with sulfuric acid as a catalyst allowed the production of resins with improved performances.

40|$|Recently we {{described}} a new method for in situ localization of specific DNA sequences, based on lac operator/repressor recognition (Robinett, C. C., A. Straight, G. Li, C. Willhelm, G. Sudlow, A. Murray, and A. S. Belmont. 1996. J. Cell Biol. 135 : 1685 – 1700). We have applied this methodology {{to visualize the}} cell cycle dynamics of an ∼ 90 Mbp, late-replicating, heterochromatic homogeneously staining region (HSR) in CHO cells, combining immunostaining with direct in vivo observations. Between anaphase and early G 1, the HSR extends approximately twofold to a linear, ∼ 0. 3 -μm-diam chromatid, and then <b>recondenses</b> to a compact mass adjacent to the nuclear envelope. No further changes in HSR conformation or position are seen through mid-S phase. However, HSR DNA replication is preceded by a decondensation and movement of the HSR into the nuclear interior 4 – 6 h into S phase. During DNA replication the HSR resolves into linear chromatids and then <b>recondenses</b> into a compact mass; {{this is followed by}} a third extension of the HSR during G 2 / prophase.
