40|$|The {{principal}} {{objectives of}} the thesis are two: firstly to study {{the accuracy of the}} satellite rainfall products in climatologically distinctive places at different scales and secondly to find the possibility of using satellite-rain gauge blended rainfall products for hydrological purposes. Three case study areas Catalunya, Bangladesh, and South Africa have been chosen for the analysis using the satellite rainfall products (TMPA) and <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>records</b> for the period from January 2005 to December 2009. The areal pattern of rainfall has been presented using satellite rainfall products over the case study areas. Both daily and monthly products are showing good agreement with <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>records</b> although it is highly variable with space and seasonality. From the results, it can be shown that TRMM satellite identified the seasonal variability of rainfall. Moreover, the mean TRMM rainfall products show same pattern as like mean rain gauge observations in daily and monthly scale in all case study areas. Finally, a blending technique is applied (originally used for radar-rain gauge blending) to conform satellite rainfall products to rain gauge observations. This blended product is also tested against the <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>records</b> to verify the improvement of the blended rainfall products over the original satellite products. Results of blended rainfall products enlightens few aspects or issues that should consider before applying blending technique including density of rain gauge network and resolution of TRMM pixel...|$|R

40|$|The GSMaP_MVK+ (Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation) dataset {{was used}} to {{evaluate}} the precipitation rates over the Wadi Dhuliel arid catchment in Northeast Jordan for the period of January 2003 to March 2008. The scarcity of the ground rain gauge network alone did not adequately show the detailed structure of the rainfall distribution, independent form interpolation techniques used. This study combines GSMaP_MVK+ and ground rain gauges to produce accurate, high-resolution datasets. Three meteorological stations and six rain gauges were used to adjust and compare GSMaP_MVK+ estimates. Comparisons between GSMaP_MVK+ measurements and ground <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> <b>records</b> showed distinct regions where they correlate, as well as areas where GSMaP_MVK+ systematically over- and underestimated ground <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>records.</b> A multiple linear regression (MLR) model {{was used to}} derive the relationship between rainfall and GSMaP_MVK+ in conjunction with temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. The MLR equations were defined for the three meteorological stations. The "best" fit of MLR model for each station was chosen and used to interpolate a multiscale temporal and spatial distribution. Results show that the rainfall distribution over the Wadi Dhuliel is characterized by clear west-east and north-south gradients. Estimates from the monthly MLR model were more reasonable than estimates obtained using daily data. The adjusted GSMaP_MVK+ performed well in capturing the spatial patterns of the rainfall at monthly and annual time scales while daily estimation showed some weakness in light and moderate storms...|$|R

40|$|On 25 October 2011 heavy rainstorms caused {{hundreds}} of landslides, debris torrents and floods in Eastern Liguria and North-western Tuscany. These phenomena produced severe damage to villages, infrastructures and road network and 12 fatalities in the Magra and Vara river valleys {{and in the}} Cinque Terre area (Massa-Carrara and La Spezia provinces). The Magra River reached very high values of water level (up to 9. 40 m at the Calamazza-Aulla hydrometer - Centro Funzionale Regione Toscana, 2011), breaking embankments and causing floods at Aulla and Fornola. On 25 October 2011 the Brugnato (Vara R.

The highest hourly rainfall intensity was recorded from 13. 00 to 14. 00 at Brugnato (143. 4 mm/h), from 9. 00 to 10. 00 at Monterosso (82. 6 mm/h) and from 10. 00 to 11. 00 at Levanto - San Gottardo rain gauge (100. 6 mm/h). The highest cumulative rainfall was also extremely high. For example, the Brugnato <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>recorded</b> a cumulative rainfall of 303. 4 mm (from 12. 00 to 15. 00) and 468. 8 mm (from 9. 00 to 15. 00). A similar condition occurred in Lunigiana, where the S. Giustina-Pontremoli, Pontremoli, Parana (Mulazzo) and Patigno (Zeri) <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> <b>recorded</b> 323. 0, 319. 8, 265. 6 and 240. 2 mm in 12 hours (from 6. 00 to 18. 00), respectively. The highest hourly rainfall intensity was recorded at the S. Giustina rain gauge (72. 8 mm/h from 16. 00 to 17. 00). The 25 October rainstorm triggered {{hundreds of}} landslides. Most of them were first-time shallow landslides such as debris slide-debris flows. These phenomena were usually superficial (0. 3 - 3 m thick), linear (width/length ratio 0. 03 - 0. 5). They mostly involved soil and sometimes portions of fractured and semi-permeable or impermeable bedrock. They mainly started in hollows {{at the top of}} the zero-order basins. There, the concave morphology favours runoff concentration and infiltration, while the concave soil-bedrock interface induces concentration of subsurface flow, saturation and build-up of pore pressures. The mass movements especially affected the road network. Many roads were blocked, isolating villages for days. Some landslides involved houses, causing serious damage and three victims at Cassana (Borghetto di Vara).

In this study, we develop a Radar Supported Operational Real-time Quality Control (RS_ORQC) method to improve hourly <b>gauge</b> precipitation <b>records</b> in eastern China by using Doppler weather radar data and national automatic rain-gauge network in JJA (i. e., June, July and August) between 2010 and 2011. According to the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative probability density function (CDF), we establish the statistic relationships between NSN precipitation records under 7 radar coverage and radar quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE). The other NSN records under 5 radar coverage are used for the verification. The {{results show that the}} correct rate of this radar-supported new method in judging gauge precipitation is close to 99. 95 % when the hourly rainfall rate is below 10 mmh− 1 and is 96. 21 % when the rainfall intensity is above 10 mmh− 1. Moreover, the improved quality control method is also applied to evaluate the quality of provincial station network (PSN) precipitation records over eastern China. The correct rate of PSN precipitation records is 99. 92 % when the hourly rainfall rate is below 10 mmh− 1, and it is 93. 33 % when the hourly rainfall rate is above 10 mmh− 1.

To help improve {{our knowledge of the}} rainfall climate, we have constructed a 30 -year (1983 – 2012), temporally consistent rainfall dataset for Africa known as TARCAT (TAMSAT African Rainfall Climatology And Time-series) using archived Meteosat thermal infra-red (TIR) imagery, calibrated against <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>records</b> collated from numerous African agencies. TARCAT has been produced at 10 -day (dekad) scale at a spatial resolution of 0. 0375 °. An intercomparison of TARCAT from 1983 to 2010 with six long-term precipitation datasets indicates that TARCAT replicates the spatial and seasonal rainfall patterns and interannual variability well, with correlation coefficients of 0. 85 and 0. 70 with the Climate Research Unit (CRU) and Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) gridded-gauge analyses respectively in the interannual variability of the Africa-wide mean monthly rainfall. The design of the algorithm for drought monitoring leads to TARCAT underestimating the Africa-wide mean annual rainfall on average by − 0. 37 [*]mm[*]day− 1 (21 %) compared to other datasets.

40|$|Hourly or 3 -hourly {{precipitation}} data from Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3 B 42 satellite products and <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>records</b> {{are used to}} characterize East Asian summer monsoon rainfall, including spatial patterns in June–August (JJA) mean precipitation amount, frequency, and intensity, {{as well as the}} diurnal and semidiurnal cycles. The results show that the satellite products are comparable to rain gauge data in revealing the spatial patterns of JJA precipitation amount, frequency, and intensity, with pattern correlation coefficients for five subregions ranging from 0. 66 to 0. 94. The pattern correlation of rainfall amount is higher than that of frequency and intensity. Relative to PERSIANN, the TRMM product has a better resemblance with rain gauge observations in terms of both the pattern correlation and root-mean-square error. The satellite products overestimate rainfall frequency but underestimate its intensity. The diurnal (24 h) harmonic dominates subdaily variations of precipitation over most of eastern China. A late-afternoon maximum over southeastern and northeastern China and a near-midnight maximum over the eastern periphery of the Tibetan Plateau are seen in the rain gauge data. The diurnal phases of precipitation frequency and intensity {{are similar to those of}} rainfall amount in most regions, except for the middl...|$|R
40|$|New Zealand {{attitudes to}} {{soil and water}} {{conservation}} have their origins in Europe and North America where legislation for the conservation of soil and water resources preceded research by 20 - 30 years. In the 1930 's and 40 's much New Zealand land was in a depleted and eroded condition. Those who first advocated soil conservation saw a clear need for remedial action in preference to research. North American attitudes, policies and research findings became the bases for New Zealand policies and programmes. Most surveys and investigations made in New Zealand mountain land were predicated on North American concern for soil surface conditions and Horton's concept of overland flow. In volume 2, problems of precipitation measurement are briefly reviewed, then information from one <b>recording</b> <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> is presented and compared with limited information from other sites. It is concluded that information from this one site {{can be used as a}} reliable index of catchment precipitation. Information from a 66 year record at nearby Mt. Torlesse station provides an assurance that precipitation values recorded during the study period are representative of the population of possible values. It also shows that while easterly storms are less common than southerly storms, they are more likely to produce floods. Volume 3 contains the data and appendices...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} {{continuous}} <b>recording</b> <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> {{makes it difficult}} to determine the rainfall erosivity factor (Rfactor) of the Universal Soil Loss Equation in regions without good spatial and temporal data coverage. In particular, the R-factor is only known at 16 rain gauge stations in the Madrid Region (Spain). The objectives of this study were to identify a readily available estimate of the R-factor for the Madrid Region and to evaluate the effect of rainfall record length on estimate precision and accuracy. Five estimators based on monthly precipitation were considered: total annual rainfall (P), Fournier index (F), modified Fournier index (MFI), precipitation concentration index (PCI) and a regression equation provided by the Spanish Nature Conservation Institute (RICONA). Regression results from 8 calibration stations showed that MFI was the best estimator in terms of coefficient of determination and root mean squared error, closely followed by P. Analysis of the effect of record length indicated that little improvement was obtained for MFI and P over 5 - year intervals. Finally, validation in 8 additional stations supported that the equation R = 1. 05 ·MFI computed for a record length of 5 years provided a simple, precise and accurate estimate of the R-factor in the Madrid Region...|$|R
40|$|The {{main results}} {{concerning}} orographic precipitation in the SE Alps can be summarized: 1. The majority of precipitation in the SE Alps is often recorded before the cold front reaches {{the area as}} heavy convection is triggered by forced ascent over steep southern slopes of the Alps and as the warm air lifts above the level of free convection. This situation is persistent (from some hours {{to one or two}} days). The precipitation maximum of the whole Alps is located in the SE Alps (the Julian Alps in Friuli Venezia Guilia and Slovenia) and it exceeds the maximum in Ticino and northern Piedmont 2. The cold front from the west was – in the most expressed MAP case IOP 5 – marked by a squall line. At {{the same time as the}} cold front was moving across the Po plain, the cold air was already flowing around the eastern Alps in the lower layers of the atmosphere and over the ridges of the Julian and Dinaric Alps. With two cold fronts (a shallow one from the East and a “deep ” one from the West, the warm air was orographically occluded and squeezed out towards the south. 3.
