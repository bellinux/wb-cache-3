30|$|A {{one-dimensional}} adiabatic {{mathematical model}} {{was developed for}} the riser reactor of an industrial <b>residue</b> <b>fluid</b> catalytic cracking unit (RFCCU). A seven-lump kinetic model was presented for the catalytic cracking of vacuum residue, taking cognisance of diffusion resistance, which is {{a departure from the}} general norm in the literature. Also, heat transfer resistance between the fluid and solid phases was incorporated into the energy balances for instantaneous and one-dimensional vaporization of feedstock. The developed model was a set of twelve coupled, highly non-linear and stiff ordinary differential equations, ODEs, which was numerically solved with an implicit MATLAB built-in solver, ode 23 t, designed deliberately for handling stiff differential equations to circumvent the problem of instability associated with explicit methods. An excellent agreement was achieved between the industrial RFCCU plant data and the simulated results of this study, with average absolute deviation being[*]<[*]±[*] 5 % for instantaneous vaporization of feedstock in all cases investigated. Moreover, the simulated results revealed that half of the reactor was relatively redundant as this accounted for only 3 % of the conversion.

30|$|The <b>residue</b> <b>fluid</b> {{catalytic}} cracking unit (RFCCU) of Khartoum Refinery Company (KRC) uses {{conradson carbon residue}} and metal-contaminated feedstocks (such as atmospheric residue or mixtures of vacuum residue and gas oils) to produce more valuable products (especially gasoline) using active zeolite catalyst in a circulating fluidized bed [1]. In the RFCCU, the oil feed and dispersion steam enter the catalytic riser reactor together with the regenerated catalyst, where cracking of vacuum residue into lighter hydrocarbons starts as it contacts the hot regenerated catalyst from the regenerator. The regenerated catalyst is made to rise by steam introduced {{at the base of}} the riser reactor between the regenerator and the feed inlet point. The vaporized feed and the catalyst pass through the riser reactor into disengager for cracked products and catalyst separation. During the cracking process, coke is deposited on the catalyst, and the spent catalyst flows down by gravity into the regenerator, where air is used to burn off the coke deposited on the catalyst in a combustion environment so that it is returned to a stable state for catalysing the cracking reaction. The hot regenerated catalyst is then re-injected into the base of the riser reactor [2]. The complexity of the typical FCCU feed makes it extremely difficult to characterize and describe the inherent kinetics at a molecular level. In this way, similar components are grouped into lumps. Therefore, lumping scheme has been used to study the reactions involved in the {{catalytic cracking}} of heavy oil. To give an insight into a comprehensive prediction of products’ distribution, there is an increasing number of lumps of the proposed models for catalytic cracking reactions [3]. In the first kinetic model of Weekman [4, 5] for catalytic cracking of heavy oil, three lumps were identified as gas oil (feedstock), gasoline, and light gas[*]+[*]coke as products, without incorporating diffusion characteristics of solid and gas phases. Lee et al. [6, 7] modified the three-lump model by splitting the light gas[*]+[*]coke lump into two different lumps of C 1 –C 4 gas and coke; therefore, resulting in the four-lump model for catalytic cracking of heavy oil. Corella and Frances [8] developed a five-lump model, in which the gas oil lump was divided into its heavy and light fractions. Different modified versions of five-lump model were developed by Dupain et al. [9], Kraemer et al. [10], and Ancheyta et al. [11]. Other proposed kinetic models for catalytic cracking of heavy oil include: 6 -lump [1, 12, 13, 14, 15], 8 -lump [16], 10 -lump [17, 18], 11 -lump [19], 13 -lump [20], 14 -lump [21], and 19 -lump [22], without taking cognisance of diffusion resistance. A comprehensive review was presented by Pinheiro et al. [23] on the subject of fluid catalytic cracking process modelling, simulation, and control. Obviously, the number of lumps of the proposed kinetic models for catalytic cracking of heavy oil may be increased to obtain more detailed descriptions of the catalytic cracking reactions and product distribution [24, 25]. However, sparing kinetic investigations have been carried out with the incorporation of diffusion resistances. Taking into account mass and heat transfer resistances between the reacting fluid and solid phases helps with conceiving the lump concentration on the catalyst surface as well as temperature profiles of the fluid and solid phases. Flinger et al. [26] considered mass transfer between the fluid and solid phases in the FCCU-riser reactor model equation. Gupta and Subba Rao [27] and Nayak et al. [28] applied the relationship for Sherwood number proposed by Ranz and Marshall [29] in their model to demonstrate the effects of mass transfer. The lump concentration within the catalyst is reduced by intraparticle mass transfer. In this way, the presence of an internal concentration gradient reduces the average rate of cracking [30]. Pruski et al. [31] validated adsorption coefficients for the four-lump model of catalytic cracking of gas oil. Bidabehere and Sedran [32] set up a model to investigate the impacts of diffusion, adsorption, and reaction at high temperature inside commercial FCC catalyst pellets and analysed the significance of these phenomenon. Dupain et al. [9] discussed external and internal mass transfer relationships utilised for FCC riser.|$|E

30|$|For {{the species}} ranked {{highest in the}} {{previous}} component, an exposure analysis is conducted {{to determine whether or}} not and to what degree the species come into contact with the primary stressor, i.e. the GM plant including the transgene product (e.g. a Bt-toxin) or the altered composition of primary metabolic compounds (e.g. starch), or any secondary stressor required for realizing the transgenic function of the GMP, e.g. the broad spectrum herbicide for HR GM plants (step 3, Figure 2). Because the respective transgene products are integral parts of the GM plants and their expression is coupled to the physiology and metabolism of the plant, exposure of associated organisms can be multi-fold and complex. Exposure can be bitrophic via the GM plant including any metabolites of the transgene products in <b>residues,</b> <b>fluids</b> (e.g. phloem) or secretions (e.g. nectar, root exudates). Exposure of higher order consumers can occur through multitrophic exposure routes when the transgene products move through the food web. Also, after movement and expression of the transgenes in other genetic contexts (e.g. wild relatives), an entirely different suite of organisms can get into contact with the novel transgene products. The same holds true after spread of the transgene products, such as the Bt-toxin including any metabolites, away from the field of release of the GM plant e.g. embedded in wind dispersed GM pollen or in GM plant residue washed into water systems like ponds, lakes, creeks and rivers, or leaching of transgene products into the soil. Determination of the possible exposure pathways requires a solid characterization of the GM plant and the expressed novel traits and accompanying management systems. Hence, this step builds on and is only as good as the information collated in the previous component I. Because GM plants can multiply and spread via pollen and seed flow, this exercise will differ significantly from an exposure analysis of chemicals.|$|R

New catalysts are tested together with a reference catalyst in both the MAT and Pilot Unit reactors.

The chemistry of melt inclusions hosted inside quartz grains (SiO 2 > 72. 7 %, Al 2 O 3 = 9. 0 – 13. 5 %, CaO = 0. 2 – 4. 3 %, K 2 O> 3. 1 %,MgO, FeOt ≤ 1. 5 %) supports the hypothesis that a progressive and continuous anatectic processes affected a peraluminous high-grade metamorphic rock (gneiss or micaschist), that constituted the Calabro–Peloritani basement and generated a quartz-bearing <b>residue.</b> The <b>fluids</b> trapped inside these inclusions are rarely composed of high-density CO 2, with a homogenization temperature to liquid phase (ThL) within the range 26. 2 – 31. 0 ◦C, corresponding to densities of 520 to 690 kg/m 3.

40|$|Abstract. Through the {{measured}} effective diffusion coefficients of Dagang vacuum <b>residue</b> supercritical <b>fluid</b> extraction and fractionation (SFEF) fractions in FCC catalysts and SiO 2 model catalysts, {{the relation between}} pore size of catalyst and effective diffusion coefficient was researched and the restricted diffusion factor was calculated. The restricted diffusion factor in FCC catalysts is less than 1 and it is 1 ~ 2 times larger in catalyst with polystyrene (PS) template than in conventional FCC catalyst without template, indicating that the diffusion of SFEF fractions in the two FCC catalysts is restricted by the pore. When the average molecular diameter is less than 1. 8 nm, the diffusion of SFEF fractions in SiO 2 model catalyst which average pore diameter larger than 5. 6 nm is unrestricted. The diffusion is restricted in the catalyst pores of less than 8 nm for SFEF fractions which diameter more than 1. 8 nm. The tortuosity factor of SiO 2 model catalyst is obtained to be 2. 87, {{within the range of}} empirical value. The effective diffusion coefficient of the SFEF fractions in SiO 2 model catalyst is two orders of magnitude larger than that in FCC catalyst with the same average pore diameter. This indicates that besides the ratio of molecular diameter to the pore diameter λ, the effective diffusion coefficient is also closely related to the pore structure of catalyst. Because SiO 2 model catalyst has uniform pore size, the diffusion coefficient can be precisely correlated with pore size of catalyst, so it is a good model material for catalyst internal diffusion investigation...|$|R

40|$|The Amba Dongar {{carbonatite}} complex, India is host {{to a large}} fluorite deposit. The complex {{consists of}} a small ring structure comprised of early carbonatite breccia, a large, outer lining of calcitite {{and a number of}} small ankeritic carbonatite plugs. Surrounding the carbonatite ring are numerous plugs of nephelinitic and phonolitic syenites. The complex was intruded into Late Cretaceous Bagh Sandstones and Late to Early Paleocene Deccan Volcanics. The hydrothermal history of the complex is extensive, consisting of two main systems, the first resulted in large amounts of fenitization, causing extensive K and Na metasomatism of the surrounding sandstones and the second, dealt with here, was responsible for the silicification of large amounts of the calcitite and the deposition of economic quantities of fluorite. The deposit consists of veins and vug fillings of blue, purple, white, yellow and colorless fluorite. The main ore zone, which is currently under production, and most other showings, are found near the carbonatite-sandstone contact. Chemical analyses and mass balance calculations show that the fluids responsible for silicification removed significant quantities of Ca from the rock while adding large amounts of Si, Al and F. Alteration associated with fluorite deposition involved the removal of Al from the rock and the addition of large quantities of F and Si.

Pleural manometry {{can be used to}} recognize a not-expanded lung. METHODS: Interval pleural pressure measurements with a high temporal resolution were performed after each removal of 200 mL of fluid to observe pleural pressure swings. Pleural elastance was defined as the difference in pleural pressure divided by the change in volume. Chest x-rays were performed to evaluate lung expansion, reexpansion pulmonary edema, and <b>fluid</b> <b>residue.</b> RESULTS: Thirty-four procedures in 30 patients were eligible for analysis. Four patients had incomplete lung expansion after drainage. No reexpansion pulmonary edema was observed. Pleural pressure swing after 200 mL drainage was higher when the lung did not expand.

CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that a high pleural pressure swing after removal of only 200 mL was related to incomplete lung expansion.

Given the segmented tissue mixture information beyond the image voxel level, not only the PV effect has been satisfactorily addressed as a particular case of tissue mixture problem, but incomplete and overcomplete ECC causes could also be maximally avoided. For clinical application to CTC that involves several issues transferring from theoretical analysis to practical validation, an innovative initialization procedure and refined estimation strategy were proposed to build an ECC pipeline based on the MAP-EM segmentation. The pipeline was evaluated based on 52 patient CTC studies, downloaded from the website of the Virtual Colonoscopy Screening Resource Center, by two radiologists.

NASA White Sands Test Facility proposed an approach that acknowledges oxygen flammability, yet selects solvent materials based on their relative oxygen compatibility ranking, similar to that described in ASTM G 63 - 99. Solvents are selected based on their ranking with respect to minimal ignition susceptibility, damage and propagation potential, as well as their relative ranking when compared with other solvent materials that are successfully used in oxygen systems. Test methods used in this approach included ASTM G 86 (Ambient Pressure LOX Mechanical Impact Testing and Pressurized Gaseous Oxygen (GOX) Mechanical Impact Testing), ASTM G 72 (AIT Testing), and ASTM D 240 (Heat of Combustion (HOC) Testing). Only four solvents were tested through the full battery of tests for evaluation of oxygen compatibility: AK- 225 G as a baseline comparison, Solstice PF, L- 14780, and Vertrel MCA. Baseline solvent AK- 225 G exhibited the lowest HOC and highest AIT of solvents tested. Nonetheless, Solstice PF, L- 14780, and Vertrel MCA HOCs all fell well within the range of properties that are associated with proven oxygen system materials. Tested AITs for these solvents fell only slightly lower than the AIT for the proven AK- 225 G solvent. Based on these comparisons in which solvents exhibited properties within those ranges seen with proven oxygen system materials, it is believed that Solstice PF, L- 14780, and Vertrel MCA would perform well with respect to oxygen compatibility...|$|R
40|$|As {{the human}} ovarian {{follicle}} enlarges {{in the course}} of a regular cycle or following controlled ovarian stimulation, the changes in its structure reveal the oocyte environment composed of cumulus oophorus cells and the follicular fluid (FF). In contrast to the dynamic nature of cells, the fluid compartment appears as a reservoir rich in biomolecules. In some aspects, it is similar to the plasma, but it also exhibits differences that likely relate to its specific localization around the oocyte. The chemical composition indicates that the follicular fluid is able to detect and buffer excessive amounts of reactive oxygen species, employing a variety of antioxidants, some of them components of the intracellular milieu. An important part is played by albumin through specific cysteine <b>residues.</b> But the <b>fluid</b> contains other molecules whose cysteine residues may be involved in sensing and buffering the local oxidative conditions. How these molecules are recruited and regulated to intervene such process is unknown but it is a critical issue in reproduction. In fact, important proteins in the FF, that regulate follicle growth and oocyte quality, exhibit cysteine residues at specific points, whose untoward oxidation would result in functional loss. Therefore, preservation of controlled oxidative conditions in the FF is a requirement for the fine-tuned oocyte maturation process. In contrast, its disturbance enhances the susceptibility to the establishment of reproductive disorders that would require the intervention of reproductive medicine technology. © 2017 The Author(s) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe study aims {{to clarify}} the ideal {{technique}} of virtual colonoscopy and how to avoid pitfalls. Patient and methods 200 patients were referred for VC screening. Results 3 D VC false positive results were as follows: Pseudopolyps due to fecal residue (17. 5 %), under-distended colon (2 %), segmental spasm (1 %), respiratory motion artifacts (3 %), prominent colonic haustrations (8. 5 %), prominent ileocecal valve (4. 5 %), prominent appendicular stump (0. 5 %) and false pits due to shine-through (1. 5 %). 3 D false negative results were proved secondary to fecal residue (1. 5 %), retained fluid (2. 5 %), colonic under-distention (5 %), prominent colonic folds (1 %) and sessile polyps (1 %). 2 D navigationThere were no false positive results. 3. 5 % false negative results were due to different combinations of fecal <b>residue</b> (3 %), <b>fluid</b> (2 %), under-distended colon (1 %), prominent colonic haustrations (2. 5 %) and sessile polyps (1 %). Finally, true positive results were proven in 40 % of 3 D and 47. 5 % of 2 D navigations, true negative: 29. 5 % in 3 D and 49 % 2 D. False positive results were proven in 19. 5 % of 3 D, false negative results: 11 % 3 D and 3. 5 % 2 D. 3 D 78. 4 %, 2 D 93 % sensitivity and 3 D 60. 2 % & 2 D 100 % specificity records. ConclusionMany overestimating or underestimating VC pitfalls could be avoided, through mastering the technique and being more familiar with different navigation methods and these technical pitfalls...|$|R
40|$|Spinel lherzolite and {{pyroxenite}} inclusions {{from the}} Geronimo volcanic field, Arizona (and Dish Hill, California) record, in their constituent minerals, a chronology of diverse mantle depletion and enrichment events. Certain {{portions of the}} lithospheric mantle have remained relatively isolated for considerable periods of time(l- 4 b. y.) while wall rock adjacent to conduits of basanite has been recently (< 02 b. y.) modified. Evidence exists for a widespread ancient (1 - 4 b. y.) partial melting residue, now recognizable as MORB-like mantle below the southwestern U. S. A. Trace element enrichment (03 - 09 b. y.) has increased the light rare earth element (LREE) and Sr content of many refractory peridotites without any mineralogical changes to the host rock. The fluids/melt responsible for this enrichment have a complex history involving heterogeneous mantle sources. In contrast, modal metasomatism of the mantle (< 02 b. y.) in aureoles around evolved derivatives of basanite has petrographically and chemically transformed this ancient partial melting <b>residue.</b> The metasomatic <b>fluids</b> responsible for such metasomatism have an asthenospheric mantle source identical to the host magma. It is proposed that modal metasomatism occurs in contact metamorphic aureoles that surround apophyses of basanitic silicate melt in the lithospheric mantle. The gradient in CO; 2 /(CO 2 + H 2 O) ratio that must surround such veins in the upper mantle (< 20 kb) may encourage the development of enrichment fronts. Immediately adjacent to the vein, a wet zone with a relatively low CO 2 /(COj + H 2 O) ratio would allow a precipitation of mica ± amphibole. Beyond this a dry zone with a higher CO 2 /(CO 2 + H 2 O) ratio would hasten chemical but not petrographic transformation of the wall rock. 1...|$|R
