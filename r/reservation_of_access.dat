40|$|There is {{a growing}} body of {{research}} concerned with the relationship between informal land delivery system and housing development in Lagos State. Studies originate from a diversity of sources, and encompass a variety of geographic scales and locations. To add to this diversity, many different characteristics of urban form as well as land acquisition patterns have been examined. This paper brings together informal land delivery system and housing development systematic patterns over the last 20 years. This paper is divided i to three sections in the area of the existing modes of land accessibility; variations in land market transactions under different cultural and social influences and practical attributes that make land transaction arrangements better suited to society's needs. The study found that informal land delivery system is more effective in delivering land for housing, because of its user-friendly characteristics and social legitimacy. The study recommended that the informal processes of subdivision of family land for sale should be based on approved layouts to ensure the <b>reservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> ways and sites for social facilities. Finally, the issue of security of tenure and the harassment encountered by developers from the "Omo-onile" should be addressed by both the local and state government...|$|E
40|$|Cognitive radio {{wireless}} networks CRNs {{have been considered}} as an efficient communication paradigm to the utilization of scarce spectrum. The main purpose <b>of</b> channel <b>reservation</b> <b>of</b> dynamic spectrum <b>access</b> (DSA) is to access these idle channels intelligently which are specialized for primary users (PUS) {{to be used by}} unlicensed users temporarily, which are called secondary users (SUS) without causing critical interference to the licensed userâs activity. In this paper, continuous-time Markov chain paradigm is improved via channel reservation to show the best usage of the radio spectrum bands, and the transition matrix are deduced for the proposed model. Moreover, the probability state vector is proved by performing steady state analysis. The deduced expressions of the suggested model are illustrated in the numerical results section.

In the presence of mixed (e. g., voice and data) traffic, an additional dynamic bandwidth allocation technique has been introduced, in order to give a better service to the real-time traffic, subject to a quality constraint, by slightly increasing data packet delay. Several comparisons show a relevant performance improvement (in terms of data delay and maximum number of voice stations acceptable within a cell) over other protocols...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a token-based channel access protocol for wavelength division multiplexed optically interconnected multiprocessors. Our empirical study <b>of</b> <b>access</b> protocols based on slotted time division multiplexed data and control channels reveals that such protocols typically suffer from excessive slot synchronizationlatency due to static slot preallocation. The proposed token-based time division multipleaccess protocol minimizes latency by allowing dynamic allocation of slots to use channels efficiently. Simulation {{results indicate that}} the proposed scheme can significantly increase the performance of protocols based on preallocation and those based on preallocation-controlled <b>reservation</b> <b>of</b> multiple channels. ...|$|R
