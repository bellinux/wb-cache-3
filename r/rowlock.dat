25|$|Employing asymmetry, heavy massing, {{high quality}} brickwork, {{semi-circular}} forms and simplified ornamentation, {{the design of}} St Paul's combines characteristics of Gothic, Romanesque and Arts and Crafts styles. The church is constructed in dark-red-brown Flemish bond brickwork, with painted render dressings defining features such as string courses, copings, lintels and sills (internally and externally). Stepped and plain buttresses support the exterior walls, and arched openings are constructed from multiple <b>rowlock</b> (brick-on-edge) courses. The prominent roof form is clad with rib-and-pan profile metal sheeting (replaced in 1997), and features flared eaves supported on decoratively trimmed rafters with a raked soffit of tongue-and-groove boards. The nave end walls are topped with stone cross finials, and gable ends to the vestries and entrance porch are finished with basket weave patterned brickwork. The entrance porch features a radiating arch with deep angled brick jambs, rounded window openings and a boarded ceiling. The belfry atop the octagonal bell tower is enclosed with fixed timber louvres between brick piers of alternating, three-course bands of rendered and face brickwork capped by a concrete hemispherical cupola.|$|E
500|$|There {{are three}} <b>rowlock</b> arches above {{all of the}} windows on the first floor. [...] One of the west-facing windows {{on the second floor}} has two <b>rowlock</b> arches above it; the other second-floor windows are rectangular. [...] There are two {{circular}} window openings in the attic, one facing west and the other south.|$|E
25|$|Rat-trap bond {{substantially}} {{observes the}} same pattern as Flemish bond, but consists of <b>rowlocks</b> and shiners instead of headers and stretchers. This gives a wall with an internal cavity bridged by the <b>rowlocks,</b> hence the reference to rat-traps.|$|R

50|$|The Norwegian {{municipalities}} of Fosnes, Radøy and Tjøme have <b>rowlocks</b> in their coats-of-arms.|$|R
500|$|The garage has {{two doors}} and two windows. [...] Both {{the doors and}} windows have two <b>rowlock</b> brick arches over them. [...] The car {{entrance}} is on the west side; a passage door is on the north side. [...] A clear-glass window with 16 panes is on the east side. [...] On the west side, north of the car entrance, is a window with beveled lead-glass panes, which appear clear from the outside but red from inside the building. [...] It has been speculated that this window was part of the parish's first church.|$|E

2500|$|Also, sweep oar rowers usually feather {{and square}} the oar with the inside hand (the one {{closer to the}} <b>rowlock),</b> {{allowing}} the handle to turn within the outside hand, whose wrist remains flat throughout. This is obviously not possible in sculling, and scullers tend to feather and square by holding the oar handle in the extended fingers when feathered, and rolling it into the palm of the hand to square it, the wrist remaining flat throughout.|$|E
60|$|Racing-boats are long, low, narrow, and light. Some are {{so narrow}} as to require iron <b>rowlocks</b> {{extending}} a considerable distance beyond {{the sides of}} the boat for the oars to rest in. Many of these light craft may be seen on the Thames and Clyde, and other rivers throughout the kingdom. The larger sort do not require what we may call the outrigger <b>rowlocks.</b>|$|R
60|$|He paused, listening, till {{he heard}} the regular grind of the oars in the <b>rowlocks</b> of the {{approaching}} boat then went on again.|$|R
50|$|The {{boat had}} no {{facility}} for <b>rowlocks</b> and oars. Some examples feature a mounting {{point for a}} small outboard motor adjacent to the rudder.|$|R
60|$|She now {{took the}} other oar from the <b>rowlock,</b> {{and was about}} to rise, when the bishop shouted to her.|$|E
60|$|She {{gave him}} a look that would have desolated most men; but only made Frank smile affably as she paddled laboriously back, {{recovered}} the <b>rowlock</b> and then her temper, as, with a fine display of muscle, she pulled out to sea.|$|E
6000|$|Anna paddled her way dexterously {{out from}} among the fleet of boats riding at anchor in the little bay; then she seated herself, {{adjusted}} one oar, and looked about for the other <b>rowlock.</b> It was nowhere visible; and, after a silent search, she deigned to ask,-- ...|$|E
60|$|In the {{meantime}} {{the two girls}} had placed the oars into the <b>rowlocks</b> and were rowing off as fast as their strength would permit.|$|R

6000|$|... 'It's {{very late}} in the season for taking ladies on the water, Miss Oswald,' said Ernest, putting his oar into the <b>rowlock,</b> and {{secretly}} congratulating himself on the deliverance; 'but better go now than not see Iffley church and Nuneham woods at all. You ought to have come up in summer term, and let us have the pleasure of showing you over the place when it was in its full leafy glory. May's decidedly the time to see Oxford to the greatest advantage.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The gondoliers eagerly {{answered}} {{with the one}} word of German known to their craft, [...] "Freunde," [...] and struggled to urge the boat forward; the oar of the gondolier in front slipped from the high <b>rowlock,</b> and fell {{out of his hand}} into the water. The gondola lurched, and then suddenly ran aground on the shallow. The sentry halted, dropped his gun from his shoulder, and ordered them to go on, while the gondoliers clamored back in the high key of fear, and one of them screamed out to his passengers to do something, saying that, a few weeks before, a sentinel had fired upon a fisherman and killed him.|$|E
60|$|Mauki {{had never}} met a white man like this, and he {{resolved}} to walk small and never offend. He saw the boat boys knocked about, {{and one of them}} put in irons for three days with nothing to eat for the crime of breaking a <b>rowlock</b> while pulling. Then, too, he heard the gossip of the village and learned why Bunster had taken a third wife--by force, as was well known. The first and second wives lay in the graveyard, under the white coral sand, with slabs of coral rock at head and feet. They had died, it was said, from beatings he had given them. The third wife was certainly ill-used, as Mauki could see for himself.|$|E
60|$|Libby got out a pair {{of heavy}} oars {{from the bottom of the}} boat, and, setting the <b>rowlocks</b> on either side, tugged silently at them.|$|R

60|$|For a {{long time}} nothing was audible in the boat but the regular dip of the oars, and their {{movement}} in the <b>rowlocks.</b> Springrove at length spoke.|$|R
6000|$|... "Iron {{rowlocks}} were {{fitted to}} it, {{on the outside}} at b, e, fig. I. (I do not give the diagram by which the author illustrated his description; the rowlocks were applied {{to the sides of}} the boat, and each <b>rowlock</b> was secured to the side by three bolts.) The two upper bolts had claw-heads to seize the iron-rod gunwale on the inside, and a piece of wood was fitted on the inside, through which the three bolts passed, to give substance for their hold, their nuts were on the outside. With these rowlocks two oars of 7 feet long were used. The breadth between the horns should be only just enough to admit the oars.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Frisco Kid {{took the}} second pair, while French Pete steered. Joe {{noticed that the}} oars were muffled with sennit, and that even the <b>rowlock</b> sockets were {{protected}} with leather. It was impossible to make a noise except by a mis-stroke, and Joe had learned to row on Lake Merrit well enough to avoid that. They followed {{in the wake of}} the first boat, and, glancing aside, he saw they were running along the length of a pier which jutted out from the land. A couple of ships, with riding-lanterns burning brightly, were moored to it, but they kept just beyond the edge of the light. He stopped rowing at the whispered command of 'Frisco Kid. Then the boats grounded like ghosts on a tiny beach, and they clambered out.|$|E
6000|$|She {{turned the}} boat about with its bow towards {{the lower end}} of the lake, but it was not done without trouble. [...] "I have not rowed for a good while," [...] she said, [...] "but I am getting used to the oars already. Now then, I'm off," [...] and she began to pull with a {{strength}} which, had it been suitably paired with skill, would have made her an excellent amateur oarswoman. But the place of skill was supplied by enthusiasm and determination. Once or twice an oar slipped from the <b>rowlock</b> and she nearly went over backward, and several times one of the blades got under the water with the flat side up, so that she had difficulty in getting it out. She raised her oars much too high in the air, but she counterbalanced this by sinking them very deep into the water. But she got on, and although her course was somewhat irregular, its general trend was in the direction desired.|$|E
60|$|The {{word was}} {{followed}} by a splash. The oars clicked sharply and simultaneously in the <b>rowlocks,</b> then more faintly, then still fainter, and then passed out into the darkness.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] said Margery, {{accepting}} {{his suggestion}} and seating herself. [...] "Now {{just wait until}} I get the oars into the <b>rowlocks,</b> {{and then you can}} push me off." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was nothing}} in the boat but two oars which had not slipped out of their <b>rowlocks,</b> a leather scoop which had been tied to a thwart, and the {{aforementioned}} water.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>rowlock</b> , {{sometimes}} spur (due to {{the similarity}} {{in shape and}} size), oarlock (USA) [...] or gate (Australia) is a brace that attaches an oar to a boat. When a boat is rowed, the <b>rowlock</b> acts as a fulcrum, and, in doing so, the propulsive force that the rower exerts on the water with the oar is transferred to the boat by the thrust force exerted on the <b>rowlock.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} <b>rowlock</b> arches above {{all of the}} windows on the first floor. One of the west-facing windows {{on the second floor}} has two <b>rowlock</b> arches above it; the other second-floor windows are rectangular. There are two {{circular}} window openings in the attic, one facing west and the other south.|$|E
50|$|One pair of oars and {{rowlocks}} or a sculling oar and <b>rowlock.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Not quite," [...] replied Peterkin.--"Here, Ralph, lay hold o' {{this pair}} of oars, and stow them away if you can. I don't like paddles. After we're safe away, I'll try to rig up <b>rowlocks</b> for them." ...|$|R
60|$|A skiff grazed {{the side}} of the Dazzler softly and {{interrupted}} Joe's reveries. He wondered why he had not heard the sound of the oars in the <b>rowlocks.</b> Then two men jumped over the cockpit-rail and came into the cabin.|$|R
60|$|Half an hour elapsed, {{during which}} {{those on the}} {{schooner}} hung over the stern listening intently. They could hear the oars in the <b>rowlocks</b> and the shouts of the rowers. Tim lit a lantern and dangled it over the water.|$|R
