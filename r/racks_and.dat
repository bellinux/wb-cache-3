5|$|The Polikarpov I-5 was a single-seat biplane {{which became}} the primary Soviet fighter between its {{introduction}} in 1931 through 1936, after which it became the standard advanced trainer. Following Operation Barbarossa, which destroyed much of the Soviet Air Forces (VVS), surviving I-5s were equipped with four machine guns and bomb <b>racks</b> <b>and</b> pressed into service as light ground-attack aircraft and night bombers in 1941. They were retired in early 1942 as Soviet aircraft production began to recover and modern ground-attack aircraft like the Ilyushin Il-2 became available. A total of 803 built (including 3 prototypes).|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{sun drying}} {{has been used}} for some {{products}} such as tomatoes, mushrooms, and beans, spreading the produce on <b>racks</b> <b>and</b> turning the crop at intervals. This method suffers from several disadvantages including lack of control over drying rates, spoilage when drying is slow, contamination by dirt, wetting by rain, and attack by rodents, birds, and insects. These disadvantages can be alleviated by using solar powered driers. The dried produce must be prevented from reabsorbing moisture during storage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In general, the {{strength}} of gears is calculated using the formula of AGMA or JGMA. But these formula can not be applied directly to {{the strength}} calculation of the <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> pinion of steering gear assay, because of complex tooth and contact shapes. So Lewis bending stress and Hertzian contact stress formula are generally used {{for the design of}} <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> pinion of steering gear assay. But these formula do not also give the exact stress of <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> pinion. In this paper, comparing the finite element analysis results and the experimentally measured values, it is shown that the finite element modeling technique of the <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> pinion of steering assay is reasonable.

25|$|The American Shad {{have long}} been a vital food {{resource}} for the people living along the Delaware River. The Lenape (or Delaware) tribe depended on the migration of the shad as a staple of their diet. They harvested the fish and prepared them in several ways. Some fish were grilled quickly on wooden <b>racks</b> <b>and</b> others were preserved for later use by smoking them or air drying. The Moravians and other early European settlers in the Delaware River Valley also depended on shad for their diets.|$|E
25|$|Since September 2007, when Mayor Thomas Menino {{started a}} bicycle program called Boston Bikes {{with a goal}} of {{improving}} bicycling conditions by adding bike lanes and <b>racks</b> <b>and</b> offering bikeshare programs, the city has improved accommodations for bicyclists {{in a number of}} ways. The least visible improvement is zoning and building code changes to encourage showering and locker facilities in major office buildings. Better signage and lane markings for bicyclists are starting to appear. More visible enforcement of traffic regulations on motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians has commenced.|$|E

25|$|In early 1994, a US Air Force program {{decided to}} modify an A-3 for F-15 radar tests, {{and the only}} {{available}} airframe was stored at NAS Alameda since the fleet shutdown.

An entire nose section was removed from a stricken F-15B at AMARC at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona and grafted onto {{the front of the}} aircraft. <b>Racks</b> <b>and</b> equipment were installed in the cabin, and the aircraft was used by Hughes and the USAF for F-15 software development.|$|E
25|$|Toe-clips and toestraps and {{clipless}} pedals {{help keep}} the foot locked in the proper pedal position and enable cyclists to pull and push the pedals. Technical accessories include cyclocomputers for measuring speed, distance, heart rate, GPS data etc. Other accessories include lights, reflectors, mirrors, racks, trailers, bags, water bottles and cages, and bell. Bicycle lights, reflectors, and helmets are required by law in some geographic regions depending on the legal code. It is more common to see bicycles with bottle generators, dynamos, lights, fenders, <b>racks</b> <b>and</b> bells in Europe. Bicyclists also have specialized form fitting and high visibility clothing.|$|E
25|$|Vespa's largest {{market by}} all {{measures}} globally is still Italy, {{but as a}} result of the mod subculture that developed in the 1960s, the ]] is still Vespa's second largest global market—and at one point in the 1960s, its largest. The appeal of the Vespa to the style-conscious mods was the weather protection. Their counterparts, the rockers rode classic British motorcycles such as Triumph Bonneville and BSAs, and needed to wear leathers against the elements. Mods would modify their Vespas, adding lights, mascots, accessories, various <b>racks</b> <b>and</b> crash bars. A new lifestyle evolved in the UK, with thousands attending scooter rallies.|$|E
