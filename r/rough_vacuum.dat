50|$|Vacuum {{pumps are}} {{combined}} with chambers and operational procedures {{into a wide}} variety of vacuum systems. Sometimes more than one pump will be used (in series or in parallel) in a single application. A partial vacuum, or <b>rough</b> <b>vacuum,</b> can be created using a positive displacement pump that transports a gas load from an inlet port to an outlet (exhaust) port. Because of their mechanical limitations, such pumps can only achieve a low vacuum. To achieve a higher vacuum, other techniques must then be used, typically in series (usually following an initial fast pump down with a positive displacement pump). Some examples might be use of an oil sealed rotary vane pump (the most common positive displacement pump) backing a diffusion pump, or a dry scroll pump backing a turbomolecular pump. There are other combinations depending on the level of vacuum being sought.|$|E
25|$|The {{vacuum system}} for {{evacuating}} a TEM to an operating pressure level consists of several stages. Initially, a low or <b>roughing</b> <b>vacuum</b> is achieved {{with either a}} rotary vane pump or diaphragm pumps setting a sufficiently low pressure to allow the operation of a turbo-molecular or diffusion pump establishing high vacuum level necessary for operations. To allow for the low vacuum pump to not require continuous operation, while continually operating the turbo-molecular pumps, the vacuum side of a low-pressure pump may be connected to chambers which accommodate the exhaust gases from the turbo-molecular pump. Sections of the TEM may be isolated {{by the use of}} pressure-limiting apertures to allow for different vacuum levels in specific areas such as a higher vacuum of 10−4 to 10−7 Pa or higher in the electron gun in high-resolution or field-emission TEMs.|$|R

50|$|Positive {{displacement}} pumps {{are the most}} effective for low vacuums. Momentum transfer pumps in conjunction {{with one or two}} positive {{displacement pumps}} are the most common configuration used to achieve high vacuums. In this configuration the positive displacement pump serves two purposes. First it obtains a <b>rough</b> <b>vacuum</b> in the vessel being evacuated before the momentum transfer pump can be used to obtain the high vacuum, as momentum transfer pumps cannot start pumping at atmospheric pressures. Second the positive displacement pump backs up the momentum transfer pump by evacuating to low vacuum the accumulation of displaced molecules in the high vacuum pump. Entrapment pumps can be added to reach ultrahigh vacuums, but they require periodic regeneration of the surfaces that trap air molecules or ions. Due to this requirement their available operational time can be unacceptably short in low and high vacuums, thus limiting their use to ultrahigh vacuums. Pumps also differ in details like manufacturing tolerances, sealing material, pressure, flow, admission or no admission of oil vapor, service intervals, reliability, tolerance to dust, tolerance to chemicals, tolerance to liquids and vibration.|$|E
50|$|To rotate, a light mill {{does not}} have to be coated with {{different}} colors across each vane. In 2009, researchers at the University of Texas, Austin created a monocolored light mill which has four curved vanes; each vane forms a convex and a concave surface. The light mill is uniformly coated by gold nanocrystals, which are a strong light absorber. Upon exposure, due to geometric effect, the convex side of the vane receives more photon energy than the concave side does, and subsequently the gas molecules receive more heat from the convex side than from the concave side. At <b>rough</b> <b>vacuum,</b> this asymmetric heating effect generates a net gas movement across each vane, from the concave side to the convex side, as shown by the researchers' Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) modeling. The gas movement causes the light mill to rotate with the concave side moving forward, due to Newton's Third Law.This monocolored design promotes the fabrication of micrometer- or nanometer- scaled light mills, as it is difficult to pattern materials of distinct optical properties within a very narrow, three-dimensional space.|$|E

After post-deposition anneal, the reflective film exhibits an infrared reflectance of 98. 7 % at 10 microns while the black film exhibits a solar absorptance of a = 0. 74 and a thermal (500 °C) emittance of en = 0. 08, (en referring to the normal emittance). The reflectance of both films, before and after anneal, has been related to their composition, grain size, and crystal structure. In particular this {{has been done in}} the infrared for the reflective films and in the visible for the black films. The solar absorptance of both film types can be enhanced by one or two antireflection layers with only slight increases in the emittance.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} and numerical study {{is made of}} the scattering of light and other electromagnetic waves from <b>rough</b> surfaces separating <b>vacuum</b> from a dielectric. The extinction theorem, both {{above and below the}} surface, is used to obtain the boundary values of the field and its normal derivative.

The scattering equations are solved numerically by generating one-dimensional surface profiles through a Monte Carlo method. The effect of roughness σ and correlation distance T on the aforementioned angular distribution, {{as well as on the}} reflectance, is analyzed. Enhanced backscattering and new transmission effects are observed, also depending on the permittivity. The ratio σ/T is large in all cases studied, and thus no analytical approximation, such as the Kirchhoff approximation (KA) and small perturbation methods, could a priori be expected to hold.

40|$|Inductive {{energy storage}} systems can have high energy density, lending to smaller, less {{expensive}} systems. The crucial element of an inductive {{energy storage system}} is the opening switch. This switch must conduct current while energy is stored in an inductor, then open quickly to transfer this energy to a load. Plasma can perform this function. The Plasma Opening Switch (POS) has been studied {{for more than two}} decades. Success with the conventional plasma opening switch has been limited. A system designed to significantly improve the performance of vacuum opening switches is described in this paper. The gap cleared of plasma is a <b>rough</b> figure-of-merit for <b>vacuum</b> opening switches. Typical opened gaps of 3 mm are reported for conventional switches. The goal for the system described in this paper is more than 3 cm. To achieve this, the command-triggered POS adds an active opening mechanism, which allows complete separation of conduction and opening. This separation is advantageous because of the widely different time scales of conduction and opening. The detrimental process of magnetic field penetration into the plasma during conduction is less important in this switch. The opening mechanism duration is much shorter than the conduction time, so penetration during opening is insignificant. Opening is accomplished with a fast magnetic field that pushes plasma out of the switch region. Plasma must be removed from the switch region to allow high voltage. This paper describes some processes important during conduction and opening, and show calculations on the trigger requirements. The design of the switch is shown. This system is designed to demonstrate both improved performance and nanosecond output jitter at levels greater than one terawatt. An amplification mechanism is described which reduces the trigger energy. Particle-in-cell simulations of the system are also shown...|$|R
40|$|Micromachined {{vacuum pumps}} {{are one of}} the key {{components}} in miniature systems for chemical and biological analysis. Miniature sensors and analyzers are normally operated at the pressure range lower than a few millitorr. We are developing a micromachined vacuum pump that is comprised of a mechanical rough pump integrated with micromachined ion-pumps. The rough pump generates a low vacuum of tens of torr from atmospheric pressure for the ion-pumps to initialize. Field ionization and electron impact ionization pumps that connect to the rough pumps continue to pump from the low vacuum of tens of torr to high vacuum of millitorr or even microtorr. The focus of this thesis work is {{on the development of the}} micromachined rough pump. A micromachined displacement pump concept is adopted for the development of the chip scale <b>vacuum</b> <b>rough</b> pump. The micro displacement pump is designed with the aid of analytical and numerical modeling. The rough pump is fabricated by deep-reactive ion etching and other standard micromachining techniques. Systematic study into operation of this class of pumps allows us to now report on a pump that achieves 164 torr absolute pressure, which is to our knowledge the lowest measured pressure in a micromachined vacuum pump operated from atmospheric pressure. This performance improvement is significant in that it enables a base pressure of less than 35 torr for a two-stage design, which allows integration with the ion pump, thus leading to realization of miniature chemical and biological analyzers. More importantly, the understanding of the micromachined displacement pumps for vacuum generation has been greatly improved and a universal model has been developed, which is very powerful to describe and predict the micromachined displacement pump behavior for vacuum generation. by Hui Zhou.

40|$|ABSTRACT Â Vacuum pumps {{have been}} {{described}} as compressors for rarefied gases. Â For more than twenty-five years the scroll compressor principle has been used in designing vacuum pumps that do not rely on oil to provide their pumping action. Â The dry scroll vacuum pump has been particularly successful as a source of <b>rough</b> <b>vacuum</b> for analytical instruments such as liquid-chromatography or gas-chromatography mass spectrometers. Â Such instruments are typically located in quiet laboratory environments where the scroll vacuum pump may be the only significant source of noise. Â Consequently, quiet operation is a key requirement of dry scroll vacuum pumps. Â This paper discusses an occurrence of stick-slip squeal that developed during the design of a new model, low noise, dry scroll pump. Â Stick-slip phenomena and the associated noise are the result ofÂ 2 ̆ 2 self-excited 2 ̆ 2 oscillations related to the difference between static and sliding friction. Â Rapidly oscillating friction forces occurring during a portion of the orbital cycle can result in induced vibration of the participating surfaces and structure, which radiate high-pitched noise.

Â The occurrence of a loud 2 ̆ 2 chirping 2 ̆ 2 noise, determined to be due to a stick-slip behavior, in a late stage prototype, caused a good deal of concern and a flurry of activity to fully characterize the vibration behavior within the pump related to the noise and to develop design modifications to ensure that the noise was eliminated.

It is very important for students’ education and training that direct quantitative measurements can be obtained during the experimental work, rather than just the simple operation of vacuum systems and qualitative analysis. Simple experiments, allowing students to perform direct measurements of the characteristics of different vacuum components and material properties, are thus important. We will describe simple experiments intended for didactic laboratory vacuum classes of undergraduate courses, where actual measurements are performed and compared with the values tabulated. These experiments are intended for five to six times 4 -h laboratory classes of an introductory vacuum course for undergraduate students majoring in Physics, Physics Engineering and Material Sciences. Small high vacuum systems are used with a <b>rough</b> <b>vacuum</b> gauge at both the high-vacuum chamber and mechanical pump inlet. This allows the monitoring of the pressure in the vacuum chamber during the roughing procedure and after the high-vacuum valve is closed. Helium leak detectors have become common in both research and industrial environments. They have changed from luxury equipment, requiring expert handling, to economic, reliable and powerful monitoring instruments, which are relatively easy to use. Therefore, it is important to include these systems in the experimental training of students. A simple experiment, using a He leak detector to measure the helium permeability of different materials, is presented...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{experiments with}} ion traps constructed with electrodes {{in a single}} two-dimensional plane, and ion traps operated in a cryogenic environment at 77 K and 4 K temperatures. These two technologies address needs which arise in developing potentially scalable approaches to quantum computing using trapped ions. Traps with electrodes in a plane are challenging to load because their trap depths are usually only of order one percent that of multi-level traps of comparable dimensions. In addition, ion heating rates in these traps are higher than in multi-level traps because of the close proximity of the electrodes that is required to achieve a reasonable trap depth and the relatively resistive semiconductor electrode materials used in planar traps fabricated with standard semiconductor lithography methods. We investigate planar traps using macroscopic ions, focusing on devising techniques for loading these shallow traps and designing electrode layouts for ion movement. Using traps fabricated lithographically with copper traces on fiberglass laminate, we trap linear chains of tens of charged particles of [approx. ] 400 nm diameter in a <b>rough</b> <b>vacuum</b> of 15 Pa. (cont.) We perform experiments to address concerns about the low trap depth of planar ion traps and develop control electrode layouts for moving ions between trap zones. Motivated {{by the desire to}} lower the heating rates in planar traps, we design and implement an experiment trapping strontium- 88 ions in a knife-edge trap in a helium cryostat. The design challenges are obtaining a long hold-time of the cryogens, lowering the residual gas pressure and loading the trap using a technique compatible with the cryogenic environment. A novel loading technique we demonstrate successfully is laser ablation loading at 4 K, employing a SrC 12 target. Laser cooling is applied to produce observations of ions, both in clouds transitioning into Wigner crystals, and of linear chains of up to 14 optically resolved single ions. These results set the stage for future experiments with a planar trap for strontium- 88 ions designed to operate at cryogenic temperatures. by Waseem Bakr. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Typical beam {{lines are}} {{comprised}} of an assembly of vacuum valves and shutters {{referred to as}} a ''front end'', optical elements to monochromatize, focus and split the photon beam, and an experimental area where a target sample is placed into the photon beam and data from the interaction is detected and recorded. Windows are used to separate sections of beam lines that are not compatible with storage ring ultra high vacuum. Some experimental beam lines share a common vacuum with storage rings. Sections of beam lines are only allowed to vent up to atmospheric pressure using pure nitrogen gas after a vacuum barrier is established to protect ring vacuum. The front end may only be bled up when there is no current in the machine. This is especially true on the VUV storage ring where for most experiments, windows are not used. For the shorter wavelength, more energetic photons of the x-ray ring, beryllium windows are used at various beam line locations so that the monochromator, mirror box or sample chamber may be used in a helium atmosphere or <b>rough</b> <b>vacuum.</b> The window separates ring vacuum from the environment of the downstream beam line components. The stored beam lifetime in the storage rings and the maintenance of desirable reflection properties of optical surfaces depend upon hydrocarbon-free, ultra-high vacuum systems. Storage ring vacuum systems will operate at pressures of {approximately} 1 x 10 {sup {minus} 10 } Torr without beam and {approximately} 1 x 10 {sup {minus} 9 } Torr with beam. Systems are free of hydrocarbons in the sense that no pumps, valves, etc. containing organics are used. Components are all-metal, chemically cleaned and bakeable. To the extent that beam lines share a common vacuum with the storage ring, the same criteria will hold for beam line components. The design philosophy for NSLS beam lines is to use all-metal, hydrocarbon-free front end components and recommend that experimenters use this approach for common vacuum hardware downstream of front ends. O-ring-sealed valves, if used, are not permitted upstream of the monochromator exit aperture. It will be the responsibility of users to demonstrate that their experiment will not degrade the pressure or quality of the storage ring vacuum. As a matter of operating policy, all beam lines will be monitored for prescribed pressure and the contribution of high mass gases to this pressure each time a beam line has been opened to ring vacuum...|$|E
