50|$|The use {{of optical}} media for the HS buses, e.g. in EFABus, has a {{significant}} effect on the physical architectures: it is not practical to implement linier T coupled bus architectures, where the bus is run around the platform (e.g. the aircraft), and each line <b>replaceable</b> <b>item</b> (LRI) connects, though a stub, at the nearest convenient point in its path. Rather, each LRI has an optical physical media connection to a common star coupler, which passively connects it to all the other LRIs connected to the same star. In the case of a reflective star, the bus connection from the RT will be a single fibre cable, over which the RT both transmits and receives (half duplex). With a transmissive star, each RT is connected through two fibres, one for it to transmit and one for it to receive data over.|$|E
5000|$|The major {{difference}} between the transmissive and reflective star coupled fibre networks is that two fibres are needed with the transmissive star coupler to connect a line <b>replaceable</b> <b>item</b> (LRI), but with the reflective star, and a [...] "Y" [...] coupler internal to the LRI, only a single fibre is required: a [...] "Y" [...] coupler, is a three-port optical device that connects the simplex transmitter and simplex receiver to a single fibre that carries the optical signals transmitted and received by the LRI in opposite directions (half duplex). However, while {{the use of the}} reflective star reduces the cabling in the aircraft, and thus weight, the excess losses involved {{in the use of the}} [...] "Y" [...] couplers and reflective star coupler makes meeting the power budget requirements, given a transmitter power and receiver sensitivity, more difficult.Whilst it is explicitly stated that the LS buses may be a fibre optic equivalent to STANAG 3838, e.g. MIL-STD-1773, there are no known implementations of this approach.|$|E
50|$|For {{two decades}} in the 1980s and 90s {{replacement}} parts for Pianets became {{harder and harder to}} find as they were no longer being supported by Hohner. The principal issue was the activation pads for the first group of Pianets, the 1960s instruments. These used urethane foam as the damper behind the leather surface of the pad. This urethane decomposed with age making the pads unusable. Hohner intended the pads to be a service <b>replaceable</b> <b>item</b> (like the strings of a guitar). Restorers and players who wanted to keep a Pianet working were obliged to manufacture their own pads. The second group of Pianets, the T and M, used silicone rubber for their pads. These have aged extremely well and are still functional in most keyboards as of 2012. The silicone pads of the T & M are not suitable for the 1960s Pianets. Their adhesion properties don't suit the ground reeds of the first group of instruments and they produce a static discharge that is amplified by the capacitive pick-up of these instruments. In the 2000s a number of businesses took up the servicing and maintenance of vintage keyboards, so pads suitable for both groups of Pianets are now available.|$|E

40|$|Presently most {{road and}} railway {{vehicles}} designed to haul toxic or flammable liquids are built {{with a single}} shell tank construction. The transportation of hazardous liquids poses a problem if the vehicle hauling the liquid is involved in an accident. Loss of liquid can happen if the tank integrity is compromised. The current work {{is an attempt to}} develop a lightweight, relatively inexpensive, sparsely reinforced elastomer liner material to incorporate inside the containers, to contain leakage should the outer shell fail. The general design methodology is thus Fail-Safe Design. If this were designed properly to be an inexpensive easily <b>replaceable</b> disposable <b>item,</b> it could prevent significant liquid loss, and reduce subsequent clean-up costs. Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) elastomer is chosen as an ideal candidate for at least one side of the sheet matrix material because of its high strength, tear resistance, puncture and cut resistance, abrasion resistance, chemical resistance, and generally good impermeability to fluids being transported. In this project, sparsely reinforced TPU elastomer composites have been developed. The TPU matrix was reinforced with webs of continuous fibers of various types and patterns, wherein the reinforcement serves as a load carrying structural element designed to resist both crack initiation and propagation. A unique thermoforming process technique has been designed specifically to produce the sparsely reinforced sheet material. Representative sheets of these materials have been studied for strength, toughness and different deformation behaviours by the means of tensile tests, tear tests, snag tests, slow puncture tests, and hydraulic bulge tests. A series of test apparatus have been designed and built for examining these mechanical properties. Also, the effect of different reinforcements, web patterns and strand diameters on the mechanical properties has been investigated. The sparsely reinforced TPU composites produce outstanding tear strength, snagging resistance, and an increase in the elongation to failure in an ASTM Die-C type of tear test. The best material of those tested to date is TPU sheet reinforced sparsely with a web of extruded polyurethane fiber. The intersections of the polyurethane rod reinforcements are very effective crack arrestors. Dept. of Mechanical, Automotive, and Materials Engineering.

50|$|In the 1980s and 1990s {{replacement}} parts for Clavinets became harder to find, as Hohner {{had ceased to}} support them. In 2000, Hohner USA relocated to a new facility and sold remaining spare parts inventory to Clavinet.com. The principal clavinet restoration issues are hammer tips and strings. The original hammer tips were made of a polymer compound that decomposes with age, so they became sticky and ultimately liquefied into a paste. Hohner intended that the tips be a service <b>replaceable</b> <b>item,</b> as in normal use they develop grooves and occasionally split. Restorers and players who wanted to keep a Clavinet working had to fashion their own tips from rubber or polymer extrusions. Clavinet.com manufactured the first aftermarket molded replacement hammer tip set in 1999, leading {{to an increase in}} the number of working clavinets and renewing interest in the instrument. Clavinet strings, while similar in gauge and style to guitar strings, are longer, making readily available substitutes a problem. Clavinet.com manufactured the first aftermarket Clavinet string set in 2000, and remained the only replacement string supplier for the entire decade—bringing more previously unusable clavinets back into service. In the 2000s, a number of businesses have begun to service and maintain vintage keyboards, and {{replacement parts}} for the Clavinet are now available from multiple suppliers.|$|E
