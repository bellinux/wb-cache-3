40|$|Aim of the study: It {{is widely}} believed, {{even in the}} medical world, that <b>rhinorrhagia</b> is {{associated}} with hypertension. The {{aim of this study}} is to compare patients with <b>rhinorrhagia</b> and patients without <b>rhinorrhagia,</b> and to clarify, within the measure of possible, the relationship between <b>rhinorrhagia</b> and hypertension. Materials and Methods: We studied a total of 80 patients, of which 42 were patients with <b>rhinorrhagia</b> and 38 were patients without <b>rhinorrhagia.</b> Among the first group, 22 were male and 20 were female. Among the second group, 18 were male and 20 were female. The first group comprised patients who came to the emergency department for <b>rhinorrhagia.</b> Their arterial pressure was measured and was found abnormally high. After an interval of 10 - 20 days a 24 hour measurement of the arterial pressure was realized, as well as physical examination, hematological laboratory tests, and retinoscopy. The second group comprised patients who came to the emergency department for one of the problems below: otodynia, headache, small contusion. The same procedure of patient examination was followed for the second group. The results of both groups were analyzed and compared. Results: The aim of this study was the possible causative correlation between epistaxis and hypertension. After having studied the two groups of patients with and without epistaxis, and after the statistical analysis of the variables studied, we realized that epistaxis is not causatively correlated with hypertension. In the multivariate analysis the confounding factors are eliminated, so we concluded that the pulses during the day and the mean diastolic pressure during the night are statistically significant variables, and they have greater values in the first group than in the second one. In conclusion we believe that epistaxis and hypertension are not correlated with each other. ...|$|E
