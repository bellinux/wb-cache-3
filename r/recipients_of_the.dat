5|$|Between {{the first}} award of the GC to an Australian in 1942 {{and the final}} bestowal to Constable Michael Kenneth Pratt in 1978, 14 Australians were {{directly}} decorated with the medal. Of these, nine were awarded to military personnel and five to civilians. Eight of the medals were awarded posthumously. At {{the time of the}} institution of the GC, living <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Empire Gallantry Medal automatically became <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new award, and were required to return their previous medal; two Australians became GC holders through this method. In 1971, the British Government announced that living <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Albert Medal and Edward Medal would henceforth be <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> GC with the option of exchanging their insignia for that of the GC. The decision for such an action {{was the result of the}} decline in the status and significance of the two awards, leading recipients to feel they were not receiving the recognition they were due. Of the 27 Australian holders of the Albert Medal, six were living at the time and all opted to exchange their insignia for the GC. None of the eight Australians awarded the Edward Medal were alive in 1971, and thus no Australian became a recipient of the GC through this exchange. Including exchange awards, a total of 22 Australians were decorated with the GC.|$|E
