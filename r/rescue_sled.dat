50|$|The fire {{department}} {{is made up}} of a force of 41 volunteer firefighters. Averaging 680 calls per year, the department covers 16 sq mi with two aerial trucks, four engines, two grass rigs, two tankers, two boats, one command/rescue truck, two hazardous materials trailers, one Homeland Security truck, one ice <b>rescue</b> <b>sled,</b> and two squads.|$|E
50|$|A rescue toboggan, {{also known}} as a <b>rescue</b> <b>sled,</b> akia (also spelled ackja, akija, and akja), or {{emergency}} rescue sledge, is a carrier for transporting a person or goods on snowy or icy surfaces. It is commonly used for wintertime mountain evacuation of an injured skier or snowboarder. There are related designs for use on water to carry accident victims or emergency equipment.|$|E
40|$|Water rescue {{practitioners}} must {{balance the}} degree of risk associated with a given technique {{with the needs of}} the victim. One such technique, the focus of this study, consists of a rescue boat positioned within moving water by means of a high line. It {{has been shown to be}} useful for high risk rescues, often when the patient or subject is unable to assist with their own rescue. Despite {{the degree of}} risk, little empirical data pertaining to the resulting load (force) placed on the highline by a boat in moving water can be identified in the literature. In the absence of contextual data, this study examines the research undertaken by the rope rescue community into the forces exerted by suspended loads, and argues that many of the resulting principles, especially the establishment of the load, are not applied during highline positioned boat operations. Therefore the research question of this thesis; ‘what force (N) will be induced by a boat positioned from a high line when deployed in moving water typically encountered during swift water rescue?’ is addressed by establishing the load under real-world operational conditions. In addition to this, the antecedents leading to a proposed worst case event (WCE) are also presented, and tested. Testing was conducted within a flow-calibrated channel offering stream velocities typical of those encountered during water related rescues. Two contrasting craft were selected for the investigation as representative of those used during swiftwater rescues, a Eurocraft (large hull) and an MFC <b>Rescue</b> <b>Sled</b> (small hull). The experiment subjected the high line to a range of forces induced by the two craft over a range of stream velocities between 0. 6 – 5. 4 ms- 1. A load cell was utilised to collect force/time data during deployments to the current vector. The independent variables of trim (relative positioning of the load within the boat) and average stream velocity were investigated. Under low flow conditions, when trimmed neutrally (the crew were positioned centrally), the Eurocraft induced the highest force on the high line (approximately 1. 22 kN at 0. 6 ms- 1 average stream velocity). When trimmed with the load placed to the rear (aft) or towards the front of the boat (bow trim) force was reduced on the high line. Conversely at higher stream velocities (4. 5 – 5. 4 ms- 1) force values rose rapidly when bow or aft trim conditions were induced, and force was reduced in a neutral trim state. The testing of the WCE induced a peak force of 3. 42 kN when the boat was deliberately flooded with water during the highest flow available (5. 4 ms- 1). The force associated with the WCE for a high line constructed with a track line mid-point angle tending to > 120 º is a theoretical force multiplication approaching that of the rating of the equipment...|$|E
5000|$|But it {{was during}} the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck that Monti {{performed}} the best-known act of his sporting career. Realizing that British bobsledders Tony Nash and Robin Dixon had broken a bolt on their sled, Monti lent them the bolt off his sled. The Britons won the gold medal in the 2-man bobsled, while Monti and his teammate took the bronze medal. Answering critics from the home press, Monti told them [...] "Nash didn't win because I gave him the bolt. He won because he had the fastest run." [...] Monti also showed his act of selfless generosity in the four-man competition. There, the Canadian team of Vic Emery had damaged their sled's axle and would have been disqualified had not Monti and his mechanics come to the <b>rescue.</b> The <b>sled</b> was repaired and the Canadian team {{went on to win the}} gold medal, while Monti's team took bronze. For these acts of sportsmanship, he was awarded the Pierre de Coubertin medal.|$|R
