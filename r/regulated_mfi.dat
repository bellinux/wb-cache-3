40|$|Subsidized {{microfinance}} institutions (MFIs) provide affordable {{credit to}} small entrepreneurs. Many industrialized countries <b>regulate</b> <b>MFIs.</b> But {{in a market}} with accessible small business financing, regulatory loan ceilings can jeopardize the supply of microcredit to the most disadvantaged people. This is because small entrepreneurs in need of above-ceiling credit {{have the option to}} combine a ceiling-high microcredit with a supplementary loan from a regular bank. By reducing information asymmetry, this type of co-financing may prompt MFIs to divert credit away from entrepreneurs seeking below-ceiling loans.

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{increasing}} pressure on microfinance institutions (MFIs) operating {{in developing countries}} to transform into regulated financial intermediaries, to date, no study has investigated whether <b>regulated</b> <b>MFIs</b> actually achieve better financial results and reach more poor clients than nonregulated MFIs. This article explores the impact of regulation on MFI performance using newly released data for 114 MFIs from 62 countries in an empirical model where performance is specified {{as a function of}} MFI-specific, regulatory, macroeconomic and institutional variables. Consistent with recent cross-country evidence on the impact of banking regulations on bank performance (Barth et al., 2004), this article finds that regulatory involvement does not directly affect performance either in terms of operational self-sustainability or outreach. The article also finds that less leveraged MFIs have better sustainability. The policy implication is that MFIs' transformation into regulated financial institutions is may not lead to improved financial results and outreach. However, the finding that MFIs collecting savings reach more borrowers suggests that there may be indirect benefits from regulation, if regulation is the only way for MFIs to access savings. ...|$|R

Initially wild and overgrown, the trail now resembles a well-developed road, cleared and shaped. The trail does not connect customers to call centers or raw materials to laborers; the path connects lenders seeking abnormal returns on their investments to borrowers living in poverty. This is the path of private equity investments in microfinance. Microfinance is a powerful financial innovation that has changed personal finance {{in many parts of}} the world. While microfinance began as non-profit means of empowering low-income entrepreneurs, the promise of scale, high repayment rates, and underserved markets has made microfinance an increasingly attractive investment for profit-seeking investors. This observation is supported by an unprecedented level of private equity investment in microfinance enterprises. Microfinance’s promise as an investment opportunity is best exemplified in India, which offers a vast low-income population, low penetration of personal financial products, liberal regulatory policies, and cultural forces that support group liability structures. This Note analyzes the investment potential of microfinance through the scope of Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in India in four parts.

40|$|Due to the {{expansion}} of microfinance institutions? (MFIs), it has been increasingly recognized that MFIs activities need to be brought under the financial sector?s regulatory framework. In many countries, this framework is underdeveloped, in others partially applied. To ensure a fully informed policymaking process, it is important to examine the lessons of experience from the countries that have begun to address the legal and regulatory framework for microfinance. One can learn from good practice as well as from misguided practice. This paper aims to provide the necessary comparative data and analysis to support sound regulatory policy for MFIs in Jordan. When it comes to <b>regulating</b> <b>MFIs,</b> one needs to keep in mind the differences between these institutions as a group, on one hand, and the existing regulated institutions on the other hand. Some opinions suggest that institutions which do not take savings do not justify regulation. However, many countries do regulate credit-only institutions, and indeed the need for transparency, market stability, and control of unfair practices suggests that some regulation is often needed. Regulation and supervision need to be targeted {{in such a way that}} their benefits in terms of depositor protection and the safety of the financial system generally outweigh the costs and risks involved. This inevitably means that only certain classes of institutions receive full regulation, while others face less strict control, and some will not be regulated at all.

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Economics) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Using an econometric {{approach}} on panel {{data collected from}} 53 microfinance institutions (MFIs) in Uganda {{over a period of}} six years (annual), this study has identified the determinants of sustainability and outreach of MFIs. In addition, the study has also used survey data from 31 non-Bank of Uganda (BOU) <b>regulated</b> <b>MFIs</b> or Tier 4 MFIs, four BOU-regulated non-bank MFIs, 12 commercial banks and the BOU itself to assess the effects of financial regulation of MFIs on their sustainability and outreach. The results indicate that sustainability is positively and significantly driven by real effective lending rates and age of an MFI, and negatively by the ratio of gross outstanding loan portfolio to total assets, the ratio of average loan size to the national per capita income, the unit cost of loans disbursed, and a group-based delivery mechanism compared to an individual-based delivery mechanism. Outreach is positively and significantly driven by an MFI being a savings and credit co-operative (SACCO) compared to being a private company, effectiveness of governance, the age of an MFI, the ratio of gross outstanding loan portfolio to total assets, and the ratio of salary/wage paid to staff to the national per capita income, and negatively by the ratio of average loan size to the national per capita income and the unit cost of loans disbursed. In the short run, financial regulation negatively influences the outreach of MFIs, but positively affects their sustainability. In the long term, financial regulation positively influences both the sustainability and the outreach of MFIs. The results suggest a number of policy options. First, the MFIs should focus on the real effective lending rate, given its significance in their sustainability. Second, for a real effective lending rate to be relatively low, the rate of inflation should be low. This calls for prudent monetary policy management by the government. Thirdly, {{the cost of doing business}} should be kept low. This calls for prudence in business management by the MFIs and creating a cost-effective business environment by the government. While the results are tentative, in order to expand outreach more SACCOs should be established and the MFIs should commit more funds to lending purposes compared to other investments. Finally, before enacting financial legislation, it is important that its benefits and costs are adequately assessed to ensure that the benefits outweigh the costs both in the short and long term...|$|R
40|$|Depth of {{outreach}} in {{the context}} of microfinance commercialization in Perú This paper seeks to answer the question of what factors are conducive to depth of outreach, that is, attending to customers on lower incomes, on the part of commercial microfinance institutions (MFIs) in Peru, in order to propose measures aimed at increasing the financial inclusion of the microenterprise sector. Using a panel database containing information on the <b>MFIs</b> <b>regulated</b> by Peru’s banking, insurance, and pension fund management comptroller (Superintendencia de Banca, Seguros y AFP) and regressions with panel-corrected standard errors, the study finds that depth of outreach would benefit from lower administrative costs per borrower, the specialization of MFI loans to micro-entrepreneurs, and higher interest rates, the first two variables being those proposed by the present investigation. Meanwhile, the trade-off between MFI depth and profitability, discussed widely in the literature on the subject, would also be present in commercial MFIs.

40|$|Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) {{traditionally}} have {{a mission to}} provide credit to {{the poorest of the}} poor and promote sustainable pathways towards a better tomorrow. Importantly, promoting financial inclusion by providing services as alternatives to the informal financial sector of moneylenders, MFIs assist in economic and social growth. In Nepal, the increasing demand for cash to meet social and religious obligations in largely subsistent village economies is increasingly supported by short-term seasonal migration. The removal of working-age males from communities produces a range of unanticipated and not necessarily desirable outcomes. MFIs, it is suggested, can ameliorate the problem and positively contribute to improved sustainable development outcomes. Potentially, significant gains in outreach are realistically achievable in the context of remote village settings where there is currently little access to cash. It is observed that cash requirements among the rural poor are increasing as more and more activities, such as the purchase of chattels and livestock plus other transactions such as religious festivals and weddings, now require money. This study examines the impact of corporate governance practices on MFIs’ outreach and financial performance in Nepal. In particular, it examines the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms in MFIs and their outreach and financial performance. How the Nepalese central bank, Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), through its corporate governance directives for Banking and Financial Institutions (BFIs) influences corporate governance practices of MFIs is analysed in this study. The good governance practices may enable the MFIs to perform better and increase MFIs’ social mission as well as their sustainability. Good governance practices can reduce the hierarchical time-consuming bureaucracy and wasteful utilization of resources necessarily diverted from MFIs’ mission. Defined structures of governance clarify the responsibilities and accountability that encourage transparency, contributing to a reduction in corruption, freeing available funds for MFIs’ mission. Nevertheless, it is debatable what forms of governance practice increase MFIs’ performance. Bankruptcy of firms around the world, especially in mature western economies, has raised concerns about governance practices. The extent to which promulgated guidelines, flowing from these failures, are applicable in low-income countries (LICs), and Nepal in particular, is not obvious and requires examination. The standard format of governance structure in developed economic countries may not work the same in a developing economic country like Nepal, which has strong hierarchical social structures and beliefs. The best fit MFI governance structure in Nepal will arise from evidence-based research in Nepal. This thesis makes a number of contributions to the existing knowledge of corporate governance and MFI performance in several ways. First, it provides evidence of corporate governance factors and how respective individual components influence MFI outreach and financial performance. Second, this study uses non-parametric quantile regression to analyse the data. This method is the most appropriate, based on careful diagnostic testing of the data. The non-parametric regression results differ from results noted in some prior research. Reconciling these differences illuminates some key social, ethnic and regional issues. Third, this is the first direct study on corporate governance practices and MFIs’ outreach and financial performance in Nepal. Finally, the potential for future research opened by the findings in the current study are noted. The relationship of corporate governance and MFIs’ outreach and financial performance is examined based on available data. Initial efforts to obtain data from NRB and the Rural Microfinance Development Centre (RMDC), relating to MFIs enjoyed minimal success. The Mix Market database provides the basic input for creating an unbalanced data panel. The time period for which reasonable coverage is available commences in 2002, post cessation of the Maoist insurgency, and finishes with 2012, prior to the major earthquake. Department of Labour (DOL) and Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) provide information relating to labour movements and employment. Reports and publications from the Centre for Financial Inclusion (CFI), Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) and World Bank (WB) are used and provide useful robustness checks on data. Additional data on the corporate governance of MFIs are collected through the self-reported annual financial statement and reports, and individual MFI’s websites. The study includes <b>regulated</b> <b>MFIs</b> as those outside the oversight of NRB report even less information. The final panel assembled, after careful diagnostic checking, did not satisfy the “poolability” requirements. Cross-sectional quantile regressions are used to examine nine core performance variables. The five outreach proxies, used were depth, breadth, average loan size, number of depositors and percentage of female borrowers as measures of social value creation. Four financial proxies, return on asset, return on equity, debt to equity ratio and operational self-sufficiency were used to inform consideration of sustainable financial performance. The findings illustrate that various governance variables impact differently across the quantiles for both outreach and financial performance measures. These differences in the impact of governance variables are significant, with the sign of explanatory variables changing with the independent factors. The results indicate that MFIs with bigger boards, more directors that are independent, high gender diversity, and high caste diversity have less outreach in terms of the number of credit clients. Improvement in staff productivity, larger sized MFIs, maturity of MFIs, and number of employees increase an ability to serve more borrowers. Loan size become larger with the presence of independent directors and higher gender diversity on the board, and diminish with CEO duality, staff productivity, maturity of firm, and number of employees. The range of statistically significant governance variables affecting the performance output proxies points to changes that are likely to encourage MFIs in their missions and benefits individual and the nation overall. This study can assist Nepalese MFIs to adjust their governance structures to improve their outreach and financial performance. The regulatory environment, including endemic corruption, can change to improve outcomes. The negative impact of the mandatory governance factors on MFIs outreach and financial performance indicates the need for preparing governance mechanisms for MFIs founded on country specific characteristics rather than compelling the code of practice of corporate governance mechanisms from other countries. Key principles like ethical behaviour and transparency underpin good governance but local factors are underweighted in prior research. The robust findings of this study emphasise the need for regulatory bodies, viz. : NRB, RMDC and other related organizations, to work together to formulate and develop the policies for MFIs industry. The underlying goal is to enhance financial capability to sustain a mission of outreach to uplift {{the poorest of the poor}}. The Nepalese MFIs industry needs a better regulatory framework that will enhance corporate governance to yield enhanced outcomes and MFIs industry growth. A more efficacious framework with less emphasis on rules and more enablement of sound policy formulation may flourish under the correct conditions. NRB’s Department of Microfinance Promotion and Supervision (DMPS) may be a key enabler of improved MFIs’ performance. The regulators and the MFIs industry may encourage the private MFIs into synergy with the not-for-profit MFIs, which will enhance the capability of the MFIs to reach to the poorest of the poor in the rural areas in difficult geographical region in Nepal. This study is unique to MFIs in Nepal and further research opportunities for other developing nations will promote components supporting more generalized evidence to further empower MFIs. MFIs with different governance systems in different countries may impact MFIs’ financial and social mission achievements differently. MFIs in other similar economic countries, operating with the same financial sustainability and social mission, are to be measured before any generalization...|$|R
40|$|The {{politics}} of microfinance {{is essential to}} an understanding both of the success and, the crises of microfinance. It {{has been argued that}} the boom of microfinance — while building on the economics of group approaches, which address problems like adverse selection and moral hazard through peer pressure and peer monitoring — cannot be explained without the ideational success of the microfinance movement, nor without the underlying state policies. In the Indian case this is both the “priority sector lending” that fuelled the fast growth of Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) and the government-supported self-help groups bank linkage program (SHG-BLP). Furthermore, three out of four Indian microfinance crises — including the major 2010 Andhra Pradesh crisis — were political not economic. Certainly, the crises also stemmed from internal management problems within the MFIs that led to problematic incentives and not enough attention given to staff and group capacity building, which in turn led to easy loans, multiple and chain loans and heavy-handed loan recovery methods. However, it is argued in the thesis that ultimately it was a state-market conflict that led to the devastating Andhra crisis, shrinking the state-wide MFI loan portfolio to a tenth and existentially threatening some of the major MFIs. As a result, it is argued that MFIs have to work more actively with the involved political stakeholders at the local, regional, state and federal levels. At the same time, they have to invest more into group building, clients´ agency and establish adequate mechanisms enabling the expression and constructive handling, of complaints and problems. Perception — like trust and reputation — is core to the sustainable success of any bank, and even more so for Microfinance Institutions (MFIs), which operate in the inherently political arena of development. Additionally microfinance is a sector that is often poorly <b>regulated</b> and supervised. <b>MFI</b> operations do not only disrupt local vested interests (like that of moneylenders of all sorts, e. g. the agricultural input selling middlemen, businessman and ground landlords) but also local and regional political interests. Politicians perceived the fast growth of MFIs as “eating” into “their” self-help groups bank linkage program (SHG-BLP). This was seen as threatening either to the genuine success of the SHG-BLP or to the usage of the program for political purposes like vote bank fostering. There are enough influential interest groups who would be happy to cut down to size, the self-declared poverty-fighting heroes, who on top made a profit from their activities. Therefore, public perception and principally, the perception of clients are central. While this study found that allegations regarding strong-armed recollection methods are not unsubstantiated, the perception of specific MFIs differs substantially. In fact, the overall perception is unexpectedly positive — given that a major crisis occurred just three years before the survey of more than 550 individuals, designed {{for the purpose of this}} thesis, was conducted. Empowerment is political and multidimensional and a key stated goal of microfinance initiatives. Political, in the sense that it encompasses the struggle of marginalised groups for their political, civil and social rights. Given the argumentation, that microfinance is intrinsically political and that perception determines the long-term success of any bank, MFIs will only be sustainable if their clients see themselves as stakeholders with a strong interest in the political survival of their microfinance loan provider(s). Therefore the thesis argues that MFIs should “invest” in their clients´ agency, in their capabilities to organise themselves and rectify grievances before they can be politically exploited, endangering the MFIs. The implemented multidimensional empowerment index found expectedly that male clients are more empowered than female clients. Furthermore, female clients were found to be more empowered with regard to decision-making than female non-clients. This was the hypothesized expectation, due either to the self-selection of already more empowered women or the positive impact of group-based microfinance on the role of women in the household...|$|R
40|$|Dissertation {{presented}} for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Stellenbosch University. Thesis (PhD (Business Management)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2010. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Uncertainty of continued donor funding poses {{a risk to}} microfinance operations worldwide, and this study explores {{the circumstances under which}} African microfinance institutions (MFIs) will consider commercial funding as a viable alternative source of funding. This research aims to identify the factors that are associated with successful access to private capital for pro-poor financial institutions. It examines the suitability of new opportunities for accessing fresh capital by MFIs for development and poverty reduction using commercialisation as an option. In a world awash in private capital, it is vital to harness the power of the private sector to solve key development challenges (World Bank, 2007). As microfinance institutions grow, they increasingly find themselves in need of additional capital to finance expansion of services to cover more poor communities. The study undertook a cross-country data analysis of 103 microfinance institutions to help provide understanding of the critical success factors that underpin successful access to commercial capital. The study also tested the hypothesis on the viability of commercial finances, and developed and tested a commercialisation success model for tapping commercial funds. The prediction model based on firm-level data from a sample of 21 African countries between 1998 and 2003, aims to minimise chances of failure and act as a screening system by investors as well as a selfassessment tool for MFIs intending to seek commercial capital. On examining the direct and indirect impact of firm-level success factors on commercialisation, the study identified key predictors of success and guidelines for MFI financing’s integration with the larger financial system. The study finds that certain critical success factors (CSFs) define minimum pre-conditions for microfinance institutions considering commercial funding as an alternative source of finance. There is evidence to suggest that the desire to tap into the capital markets and capacity to link with commercial investors is a realisable vision for African MFIs. The research evidence is instructive of widened financing options for MFIs and capacity to relax growth constraint in the industry. Based on the CSFs, the study suggests how MFIs can break free from 'captive' donor funding as a necessary platform for the switch to commercial finance in the industry. However, the findings also suggest the need for MFIs to satisfy the interests and requirements of prospective commercial investors to overcome new challenges. In particular, the results show that the extent of organisational formalisation and transparency in financial reporting are absolutely essential in drawing commercial lenders to invest in microfinance. In addition the study establishes the reasons why traditional approaches to financing microfinance cannot work any longer. There are some concerns on mission drift; in particular whether the poor gain from commercialisation, and under what circumstances their interests are taken care of in order to preserve the long-term social value of microfinance as a poverty reduction strategy. The study was carried out based on a rather limited time series data. However, the number of firms and the diversity is considered adequate for the study, as well as sample representation across Africa. The study also used views of 'thought leaders' as the source of information. Other personnel calibre may have had different suggestions. Perceptions were drawn from commercial lenders/investors of microfinance programmes based in Africa. Needless to say, any generalisation of CSFs beyond the African microfinance context should be made with caution. This study {{is probably one of the}} first attempts to explore the possibility of a linkage between microfinance and capital markets and it will be of interest to MFIs, commercial banks, international donors and investment funds with an interest in investing in the microfinance industry. The findings suggest that the speed of increase in financial leverage per country depends as much on the dynamism of the market, as it does on the level of development of the finance sector. The results indicate that commercial investors will be attracted by good financial returns and administrative efficiency (return on assets, cash-flow adequacy and operating expense ratio), transparent reporting and information disclosure and clarity, as well as low inflation levels. Investors will also be looking for larger, <b>regulated</b> and profitable <b>MFIs</b> with a low-risk profile for their investment portfolios. The study found strong support to the hypothesis that the commercialisation index (CI) is a better measure of successful commercialisation than the LMA (leverage multiplier added), given the variables used. In all cases, compelling evidence shows that the CI has more explanatory power and is an accurate predictor of two-year success in commercialisation as examined by logistic regression. These results suggest that the superior predictive abilities of the CI commercial rating rule could be explored to guide screening efforts for winners, investment decisions and other binary classification investigations. Specifically, the model can be useful in guiding successful commercialisation schemes in Africa because it provides MFIs with a structured approach for achieving sustainable commercial microfinance. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Onsekerheid oor volgehoue skenkerbefondsing is ’n risiko vir mikrofinansieringsinstansies wêreldwyd, en hierdie studie ondersoek die omstandighede waaronder Afrika se mikrofinansieringsinstansies (MFIs) kommersiële befondsing sal oorweeg as ’n lewensvatbare, alternatiewe bron van befondsing. Hierdie navorsing poog om die faktore, wat met die suksesvolle toetrede tot private kapitaal van pro-arm finansiële instellings geassosieer word, te identifiseer. Dit ondersoek die gepastheid van nuwe geleenthede vir MFIs om vars kapitaal te bekom en as ’n opsie te gebruik vir ontwikkeling en die vermindering van armoede deur kommersialisasie. In ’n wêreld met oorvloedige bronne van private kapitaal is dit lewensnoodsaaklik om die krag van die privaatsektor in te span om kern ontwikkelingsuitdagings op te los (World Bank, 2007). Soos mikrofinansieringsinstansies groei, het hulle ’n toenemende behoefte aan addisionele kapitaal ten einde die uitbreiding van dienste te kan finansier en om meer arm gemeenskappe te kan bereik. Die studie het data komende van 103 mikrofinansieringsinstansies uit verskeie lande ontleed om begrip van die kritiese suksesfaktore (KSFe), wat suksesvolle toegang tot kommersiële kapitaal onderskraag, te verkry. Die studie het ook die hipotese oor die lewensvatbaarheid van kommersiële finansiering getoets, en ’n model vir kommersialisasie-sukses ontwikkel en getoets om kommersiële fondse te bekom. Die voorspellingsmodel, wat gebaseer is op maatskappy-vlak data van ’n groep van 21 Afrika lande tussen 1998 en 2003, poog om die kanse op mislukking te minimeer en te dien as ’n siftingstelsel vir beleggers sowel as ’n selfondersoekmiddel vir MFIs wat beplan om kommersiële kapitaal te bekom. Deur die direkte en indirekte impak van maatskappyvlak suksesfaktore op kommersialisasie te bestudeer, het die studie sleutelvoorspellers van sukses asook riglyne vir die integrasie van MFI finansiering met die groter finansiële stelsel geïdentifiseer. Die studie bevind dat sekere KSFe minimum voorvereistes vaslê vir MFIs wat kommersiële befondsing as ’n alternatiewe bron van finansiering oorweeg. Daar is bewyse wat daarop dui dat die begeerte om toegang tot die kapitaalmarkte te verkry en die kapasiteit om met kommersiële beleggers te skakel ’n realiseerbare visie vir Afrika MFIs is. Die navorsing lewer insig wat aanduidend is van breër finansieringsopsies vir MFIs, en wat die beperkinge op groei in die industrie verslap. Gebaseer op die KSFe, stel die studie voor hoe MFIs uit die houvas van skenkerbefondsing kan loskom as ’n nodige stap vir die oorskakeling na kommersiële finansiering in die bedryf. Die bevindings dui egter ook op die behoefte van MFIs om aan die belange en vereistes van moontlike kommersiële beleggers te voldoen ten einde nuwe uitdagings te oorkom. Die resultate dui spesifiek daarop dat die mate van organisasie-formalisering en die deursigtigheid van finansiële verslagdoening noodsaaklik is om kommersiële uitleners te trek om in mikrofinansiering te belê. Verder bevestig die studie die redes waarom tradisionele benaderings tot die finansiering van mikrofinansiering nie meer kan werk nie. Daar is wel sekere bekommernisse oor die moontlike kompromittering van missie; in besonder is die vraag of die armes wel baat vind by kommersialisasie, en onder watter omstandighede daar na hulle belange omgesien word ten einde die langtermyn sosiale waarde van mikrofinansiering as ’n strategie vir armoede verligting te behou. Die studie is uitgevoer gegrond op tydreeksdata wat betreklik beperk is. Die aantal maatskappye en die diversiteit word egter as voldoende beskou vir die studie, asook dat die steekproef verteenwoordigendend was van lande regoor Afrika. Die studie gebruik ook die menings van ‘leierdenkers’ as ’n bron van inligting. Personeel van ’n ander kaliber mag verskillende voorstelle gehad het. Persepsies is verkry van kommersiële uitleners/beleggers van mikrofinansieringsprogramme wat in Afrika gebaseer is. Vanselfsprekend behoort enige veralgemening van die KSFe buite die Afrika mikrofinansieringskonteks met omsigtigheid gedoen word. Hierdie studie is waarskynlik een van die eerste pogings om die moontlikheid van ’n skakel tussen mikrofinansiering en die kapitaalmarkte te ondersoek en dit sal van waarde wees vir MFIs, kommersiële banke, internasionale skenkers en beleggingsfondse wat in belegging in die mikrofinansieringsbedryf belangstel. Die bevindinge dui daarop dat die spoed waarmee die effek van finansiële hefboom in ‘n land toeneem net soveel afhang van die dinamika van die mark as van die ontwikkelingsvlak van die finansiële sektor. Die bevindinge dui daarop dat kommersiële beleggers aangetrek sal word deur goeie finansiële opbrengste, administratiewe doeltreffendheid (opbrengs op bates, voldoende kontantvloei en die bedryfsuitgawe verhouding), deursigtige verslagdoening en duidelike openbaarmaking van inligting, sowel as lae inflasievlakke. Beleggers gee ook voorkeur aan groter, gereguleerde en winsgewende MFIs met ’n lae risikoprofiel vir hulle beleggingsportefeuljes. Die studie vind sterk ondersteuning vir die hipotese dat die Kommersialisasie-indeks (CI) ’n beter aanduiding van suksesvolle kommersialisasie is as die Leverage Multiplier Added (LMA), gegewe die veranderlikes wat gebruik is. In alle gevalle was daar sterk getuienis dat die CI ’n beter verduideliker is en ’n akkurate voorspeller is van die tweejaartermyn sukses in kommersialisasie soos deur middel van logistiese regressie getoets. Hierdie resultate dui daarop dat die superieure voorspellingsvermoëns van die CI se kommersiële beoordelingsreëls beproef kan word om die sifting van wenners, beleggingsbesluite en ander binêre klassifikasie ondersoeke te lei. Die model kan spesifiek nuttig wees om rigting te gee aan suksesvolle kommersialisasieskemas in Afrika omdat dit MFIs ’n gestruktureerde benadering gee tot die bereiking van volhoubare kommersiële mikrofinansiering...|$|R
