500|$|Zack Handlen {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "crazy enough at the end that, if nothing else, I <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what happens next". He enjoyed the basic premise, {{involving}} the idea that aliens were active {{in the development of}} humanity—comparing it to Stanley Kubrick’s film [...] and Ridley Scott’s movie Prometheus. However, Handlen, since he was reviewing the series retrospectively, was slightly disappointed that the plot was dropped in subsequent season. In the end, he noted that the entry was [...] "ambitious, but it doesn’t exactly make sense, which is pretty much where [...] is at now." ...|$|E
500|$|Blair and Trent Burroughs share a loveless marriage. Blair remains, {{according}} to Janelle Brown, [...] "the moral center of Ellis' work", and Trent {{has become a}} Hollywood manager. The Oregonian notes [...] "Although Blair and Trent have children, the children are never described and hardly mentioned; their absence is [...] "even more unsettling than the absence of parents in a story about teenagers, underlining the endlessly narcissistic nature of the characters' world." [...] Julian Wells {{has gone on to}} establish a very exclusive escort service of his own in Hollywood. While in Less Than Zero, Clay felt protective of Julian, who had fallen into prostitution and drug addiction, in the new novel, he attempts to have him killed. The [...] "grisly" [...] dispatch of Julian late in the book, and Clay's casual mention of it early on, were part of a [...] "rhythm" [...] that Ellis felt suited the book. He speculates whether [...] "the artist looking back" [...] becomes a destructive force. He hadn't planned to kill off the character, just finding that while writing [...] "it felt right". Rip Millar occupies both terrifying and comic relief roles in the novel. Vice describes him, hyperbolically, as [...] "like the supervillain of these two books". Uncertainties about the character's [...] "specifics" [...] originate in Clay, who [...] "doesn't <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> which makes it kind of scarier".|$|E

500|$|Sigourney Weaver has {{expressed}} interest in reuniting with Ridley Scott to revive her character for another Alien film. In the 2003 commentary track for the Alien DVD included in the Alien Quadrilogy set, she and Scott both speculated on the possibility, with Weaver stating: [...] "There is an appetite for a fifth one, which is something I never expected...it's really hard {{to come up with}} a fifth story that's new and fresh...but I have wanted to go back into space...I think outer space adventure is a good thing for us right now, 'cause Earth is so grim...so we've been talking about it, but very generally." [...] Scott remarked that, if the series were to continue, the most logical course would be to explore the origins of the space jockey and the Aliens. Weaver supported this idea, saying [...] "I think it would be great to go back, because I'm asked that question so many times: 'Where did the Alien come from?' People <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> in a very visceral way." [...] David Giler said that he, Walter Hill, and Gordon Carroll, the producers of the first four films in the series, would not be willing to produce another unless it was about the Aliens' homeworld and Weaver was on board (despite the fact that they were among the producers of Alien vs. Predator films). Weaver, in turn, indicated that she would only return to the franchise if either Scott or James Cameron were to direct. Cameron had been working on a story for a fifth Alien film which would explore the origins of the creatures, but ceased work on it when he learned that Fox was pursuing Alien vs. Predator, which he felt would [...] "kill the validity of the franchise".|$|E

But those who <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> more about Russians sooner or later {{recognize}} that Russia is not all contained in Dostoyevsky and Chekhov, and {{that if you want to}} know anything, you must first be free of prejudice and on your guard against hasty generalizations." ...|$|E
2500|$|MG Siegler of TechCrunch {{said that}} the {{difference}} between Lion and Mountain Lion was not comparable to the difference between Leopard and Snow Leopard because Mountain Lion adds many new features that were not available in Lion. He also praised the application compatibility and {{said that the}} only updates needed were to add Notification Center features to applications. Jim Dalrymple of The Loop commented [...] "there will be tens of thousands of words published on Wednesday when Mountain Lion hits the Mac App Store, but let's face it, what you <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> is whether Mountain Lion is worth the upgrade. Let's get that out of the way now — yes, it is definitely worth it," [...] and said that at $19.99, Mountain Lion was a [...] "bargain". David Pogue of The New York Times said [...] "Over all, then, Mountain Lion is a gentle, thoughtful upgrade. All 200 new features? No, not really. But 10 that you'll use every day? For $20? Yes." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{success of}} this reunion led The Cowsills back into the {{recording}} studio, {{which resulted in the}} album Global. This has also led to several reunions over the years in various forms, ranging from a few concerts to special feature performances at major events. [...] Most notable of these events were [...] "A Taste of Rhode Island in 2000", which featured all seven surviving Cowsills, and [...] "A Family Thing 2", which was a benefit concert in 2004 for Bill's medical and financial difficulties at the time. This concert took place at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles and included an appearance by Shirley Jones, who introduced the band. It was the first time they had ever met. As the mother on the TV show inspired by the Cowsills, Shirley made a point of calling them [...] "the real thing". Though she did not sing with them that night, immediately after her announcement the Cowsills played [...] "I <b>Really</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Know</b> You"; it is the one song recorded by both The Cowsills and The Partridge Family. [...] During this period, Barry also released a solo CD, As Is.|$|E

2500|$|Xi Zheng, then an {{assistant}} {{official in the}} palace library, often visited Meng Guang to consult him. When Meng Guang asked him what the crown prince, Liu Xuan, had been learning and reading {{and what he was}} interested in, Xi Zheng replied, [...] "He treats the people around him respectfully. He is very diligent and hardworking. He has the style of a crown prince of ancient times. When he meets people, he shows sincerity, kindness and generosity in everything he says and does." [...] Meng Guang then said, [...] "This is what is expected of every other person. What I <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> is his level of political wisdom and how good his political skills are." [...] Xi Zheng replied, [...] "The Crown Prince's approach towards life is to focus on winning people's hearts and favour. He won't do what he shouldn't do. He doesn't openly reveal his wisdom. Besides, political skills can only be used under certain circumstances; they cannot be cultivated and learnt in advance." [...] Meng Guang knew that Xi Zheng was trying to careful with his words, so he said, [...] "I like to speak my mind as freely as possible. Every time I openly make criticisms, people will ridicule or hate me for that. Although I sense that you don't like to hear what I say, my words make sense. The Empire is not unified yet. Political skills are crucial in this time and age. While one's mastery of political skills depends on his intellectual abilities, political skills can be learnt and mastered through diligence. This {{has to do with the}} Crown Prince's education. He should be striving to enrich himself with as much knowledge as possible so that he can be like a consultant. He should also sit for written and oral tests like academics and gain some titles. This is a top priority for him." [...] Xi Zheng strongly agreed with him.|$|E

Skeeter Davis recorded 'I <b>Really</b> <b>Want</b> You <b>To</b> Know', an answer song to Eddy Arnold's version, written with her by Don Robertson and Howard Barnes for the 1961 album 'Here's The Answer', which also included Davis' version of I <b>Really</b> Don't <b>Want</b> <b>To</b> <b>Know.</b>|$|R

50|$|Web London as {{the epitome}} of the HRT guy is a strong, loyal friend {{especially}} to his team members and their families. He, naturally, has issues dealing with his own issues. Yet, in this instance, he is unusually motivated to continue his therapy since he's the one that <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what happened. As much as Baldacci paints HRT as real American heroes, by delving into this psychological {{side of the story}} he also points out the character deficiencies that cause these men to go through the most grueling training and then to subject themselves to the greatest danger. It also fills out this multi-layered plot.|$|R

5000|$|After leaving school, Govan studied English at the University of Oxford. He {{dropped out}} after a year {{to pursue a career}} in music. Govan states that he was torn between {{continuing}} his studies or focusing on becoming a musician; he ultimately decided to concentrate on the latter. Around this time, (by Govan's own estimation, 1991) he sent demos of his work to Mike Varney of Shrapnel Records. Varney was impressed and offered him a record deal. Govan declined, despite inititiating contact in the first place. He expained that: [...] "it was as though all I <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> was that I was good enough … I found I was getting a bit wary of the shred movement." ...|$|R

Idle asks Jones a series of questions about his romantic relationships that seem odd and cryptic, but that are eventually revealed to be complex double entendres. Jones becomes irritated by the line of questioning and asks Idle, directly, what he is implying. Idle forwardly admits that he <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> whether Jones has ever [...] "slept with a lady," [...] and when directly answered [...] "yes," [...] curiously asks [...] "What's it like?", {{making it one of the}} few Monty Python sketches to end on a clear punch line.|$|R
