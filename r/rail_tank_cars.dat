40|$|The flow of {{gases and}} vapours from {{pressure}} vessels {{to the atmosphere}} is investigated. Two major points are addressed, first, the non-steady mass flow rates and the non-steady pressure and temperature variations, due to the finite size of the pressure vessel, and second {{the effect on the}} blow-down process if the vapour is not assumed to be a perfect gas, as is suggested in current pressure vessel safety codes, but if a more realistic equation of state is selected to describe the thermodynamic behaviour of the vapour. For the non-steady outflow of perfect gases analytically derived correction functions are given with which the complete blow-down phenomena can be calculated from the well known steady flow equations. For the non-steady outflow of real gases and vapours a calculation method is described and the computer algorithm is given.

40|$|Attoh-Okine, Nii O. Risk {{managers}} assessing {{hazardous materials}} release risk along various railroad routes and regions are tasked with evaluating the average likelihood of hazmat release from a derailed fleet of <b>tank</b> <b>cars</b> given varying proportions of <b>tank</b> <b>car</b> safety designs and operating conditions. These variations or changes {{may be as}} a result of retrofitting or phasing out of existing safety features (which have been deemed outmoded or unacceptable in the new safety climate), <b>tank</b> <b>car</b> fleet upgrade, construction of <b>tank</b> <b>cars</b> with new specifications, enhanced advanced braking rules or varying operating speeds. This thesis seeks to present Bayesian Networks (BNs) as a viable approach for modelling and supporting decision making in the fields of hazardous materials transportation risk and <b>rail</b> <b>tank</b> <b>car</b> safety. This approach estimates the average Conditional Probability of Release (CPR) of an existing or projected fleet of cars plying a given railroad route or region. CPR is one of the two primary components used in the analysis of hazardous materials release risk. This methodology can be used in assessing the reduction (or otherwise) of the average CPR of an existing or proposed fleet of <b>tanks</b> <b>cars</b> given a change in risk reduction option (<b>tank</b> <b>car</b> design safety feature or operating conditions). BNs allow for the evaluation of the effect of new or alternate risk reduction options (RRO) on the total network. They {{can also be used to}} evaluate the merits and demerits of the practice of grandfathering from a release probability point of view. Furthermore, Bayesian Networks can be used to easily rank the effect of various safety features and operating conditions given a CPR estimate dataset of all possible state combinations of the variables (risk reduction options) being considered. This allows researchers and decision makers to make decisions on which RRO to employ. As a result of interactive and flexible nature of BNs, these models can be integrated with other models to arrive at such a decision. The resulting average CPR value obtained from these models can be subsequently incorporated into the analysis of hazmat transportation risk. A CPR estimate dataset of possible combinations of four <b>tank</b> <b>car</b> design safety features was considered in the study. The features were tank thickness, insulation, head shield protection and top fittings protection. The aforementioned along with the total CPR made up the random variables of the Bayesian Network. The BN modelling was implemented using the commercially available HUGIN software. The average CPRs of the <b>tank</b> <b>cars</b> were computed given varying proportions of risk reduction options combinations. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of various risk reduction options on the CPR of the fleet which were subsequently ranked.

50|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, {{operational}} {{problems on the}} Port Sudan-Khartoum section of Sudan Railways had resulted in inadequate supplies of petroleum products reaching Khartoum {{and other parts of}} the country. In 1975 construction of an oil pipeline from the port to Khartoum was begun to relieve traffic pressure on the railroad. It was completed in mid-1976, but leaks were discovered and the 815-kilometer-long pipeline, laid generally parallel to the railroad, did not become operational until September 1977. As constructed, its capacity was 600,000 tons a year, but that throughput was only attained in mid-1981. In early 1982, steps were taken to add additional booster pumping stations to increase the rate to an annual throughput capacity of 1 million tons. The line carried only refined products, including gasoline, gas oil, kerosene, and aviation fuel obtained either from the refinery at the port or from import-holding facilities there. These fuels were moved in a continuous operation to storage tanks at Khartoum with some capacity offloaded at Atbarah. <b>Rail</b> <b>tank</b> <b>cars</b> released by the pipeline were reassigned to increase supplies of petroleum products in the western and southwestern regions of the country.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research project was to quantify the emission of VOCs during the transport of mineral oil products by means of <b>rail</b> <b>tank</b> <b>cars.</b> The aim was furthermore to develop appropriate measures {{on the basis of}} the results in order to reduce or avoid emissions. At present approximately 1. 2 thousand tons of VOC are annually emitted due to the railway transport of motor fuel. This corresponds to a share of about 1 / 40 of the total actual NMVOC-emissions from transport of motor fuel although in Germany approximately 1 / 3 of the transports are carried out by railway. Other mineral oil products are not relevant for VOC-emissions. A combination of several technical, organisational and logistic measures would enable to further reduce the actual emissions. The following measures for the mitigation and reduction of emissions would be possible: (1) Consequent implementation of the 'best practice'. (2) Improvement of the efficiency of the exhaust air cleaning during inside cleaning of <b>rail</b> <b>tank</b> <b>cars.</b> (3) Reduction of remaining liquid during emptying procedures. (4) Filling by means of bottom loading. (5) Furnishing of <b>rail</b> <b>tank</b> <b>cars</b> with overpressure deflation junction and corresponding adaptation of filling stations and modification of the top-loading procedure (connection to the overpressure deflation junction before opening of the man hole cover). (6) Improvement of the efficiency of the vapour recycling installation. The measures (1) and (2) are recommended on the basis of a technical-economic-ecologic evaluation. The measures (3) to (6) are only recommendable in specific single cases. There is no need for legislative action. (orig.)

The assessment was conducted in response to community concerns {{about the safety of}} a proposed yard expansion. Six different chemicals are involved. For each one, the average monthly volume and the hazard of most concern are specified. We use an event tree populated with empirical data to compute the probability of a major spill in each case and we estimate the corresponding critical impact distances using available modeling tools. We find that for some of the chemicals, the relative increases in risk are appreciable, but that in all cases, the absolute levels of risk remain low. Then we identify some ways in which such an analysis can be extended and discuss the potential difficulties associated with these extensions. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
