Old Margaret, that kindest of nurses, could not bear to see her dear Miss Lizzie untidy, or to hear her dear Miss Lizzie scolded, so she mended and mended without saying anything, encouraging me in habits of arrant slovenliness, and if I had but known it, of deceit. Dear old Margery, it was a heart-breaking thing when she went away, to all from Winifred upwards, and to none more than to me, who could remember those two melancholy years when she often seemed my only friend, when I was often naughty and Papa angry with me, and I feeling motherless and wretched, used to sit on her lap and cry. Dear old Margery, it is a shame to abuse her in spite of the mischief her over-kindness did us all. Well, when our new maid came, on the supposition that Miss Woodbourne took care of her own clothes, she never touched them; and as Margaret's work was not endowed with the fairy power of lasting for ever, I soon grew as ragged as any <b>ragged-robin</b> in the hedge. Mamma used to complain of my slovenliness, but I am afraid I was naughty enough to take advantage of her gentleness, and out-argue her; so things grew worse and worse, till at last, one fatal day, Papa was aware of a great hole in my stockings. Then forth it all came; he asked question after question; and dear kind Mamma, even more unwilling to expose me than I was myself, was forced to answer, and you may suppose how angry he was. Oh! Anne, I can hardly bear to think of the stern kindness of his voice when he saw I was really quite wretched. And only think how kind it was in him, he spoke seriously to me, he shewed me that building the church, helping our poor people, even Mamma's comforts, and the boys' education, depend upon home economy; and how even I could make a difference by not wasting my clothes, and making another servant necessary.' ...|$|E
6000|$|And Enid looked, but all {{confused}} at first, [...] Could scarce {{divide it}} from her foolish dream: [...] Then suddenly she knew it and rejoiced, [...] And answered, 'Yea, I know it; your good gift, [...] So sadly lost on that unhappy night; [...] Your own good gift!' 'Yea, surely,' said the dame, [...] 'And gladly given again this happy morn. [...] For when the jousts were ended yesterday, [...] Went Yniol through the town, and everywhere [...] He found the sack and plunder of our house [...] All scattered through the houses of the town; [...] And gave command that all which once was ours [...] Should now be ours again: and yester-eve, [...] While ye were talking sweetly with your Prince, [...] Came one with this and laid it in my hand, [...] For love or fear, or seeking favour of us, [...] Because we have our earldom back again. [...] And yester-eve I would not tell you of it, [...] But kept it for a sweet surprise at morn. [...] Yea, truly {{is it not a}} sweet surprise? [...] For I myself unwillingly have worn [...] My faded suit, as you, my child, have yours, [...] And howsoever patient, Yniol his. [...] Ah, dear, he took me from a goodly house, [...] With store of rich apparel, sumptuous fare, [...] And page, and maid, and squire, and seneschal, [...] And pastime both of hawk and hound, and all [...] That appertains to noble maintenance. [...] Yea, and he brought me to a goodly house; [...] But since our fortune swerved from sun to shade, [...] And all through that young traitor, cruel need [...] Constrained us, but a better time has come; [...] So clothe yourself in this, that better fits [...] Our mended fortunes and a Prince's bride: [...] For though ye won the prize of fairest fair, [...] And though I heard him call you fairest fair, [...] Let never maiden think, however fair, [...] She is not fairer in new clothes than old. [...] And should some great court-lady say, the Prince [...] Hath picked a <b>ragged-robin</b> from the hedge, [...] And like a madman brought her to the court, [...] Then were ye shamed, and, worse, might shame the Prince [...] To whom we are beholden; but I know, [...] That when my dear child is set forth at her best, [...] That neither court nor country, though they sought [...] Through all the provinces like those of old [...] That lighted on Queen Esther, has her match.' ...|$|E

60|$|But it was {{not till}} she had been left to herself for a full five months, and the blue-bells and <b>ragged-robins</b> of the {{following}} year were again making themselves common to the rambling eye, that he directly addressed her. She was tying up a group of tall flowering plants in the garden: {{she knew that he}} was behind her, but she did not turn. She had subsided into a placid dignity which enabled her when watched to perform any little action with seeming composure--very different from the flutter of her inexperienced days.|$|R
60|$|May 19.--And {{so it has}} come! My mere {{avoidance}} of him has precipitated the worst issue--a declaration. I had occasion {{to go into the}} kitchen garden to gather some of the double <b>ragged-robins</b> which grew in a corner there. Almost as soon as I had entered I heard footsteps without. The door opened and shut, and I turned to behold him just inside it. As the garden is closed by four walls and the gardener was absent, the spot ensured absolute privacy. He came along the path by the asparagus-bed, and overtook me.|$|R

60|$|A half-past {{two that}} afternoon, full of {{optimism}} and cold beef, gaily unconscious that Webster, with measured strides was approaching ever nearer with the note that was to give it him in the neck, proper, Samuel Marlowe dangled his feet from the top bar of the gate {{at the end of}} the lane and smoked contentedly as he waited for Billie to make her appearance. He had had an excellent lunch; his pipe was drawing well, and all Nature smiled. The breeze from the sea across the meadows, tickled pleasantly the back of his head, and sang a soothing song in the long grass and <b>ragged-robins</b> at his feet. He was looking forward with a roseate glow of anticipation to the moment when the white flutter of Billie's dress would break the green of the foreground. How eagerly he would jump from the gate! How lovingly he would....|$|R
60|$|Yeobright did not {{interrupt}} the preparations, {{and went home}} again. The next morning, when Thomasin withdrew the curtains of her bedroom window, there stood the Maypole {{in the middle of}} the green, its top cutting into the sky. It had sprung up in the night, or rather early morning, like Jack's bean-stalk. She opened the casement to get a better view of the garlands and posies that adorned it. The sweet perfume of the flowers had already spread into the surrounding air, which, being free from every taint, conducted to her lips a full measure of the fragrance received from the spire of blossom in its midst. At the top of the pole were crossed hoops decked with small flowers; beneath these came a milk-white zone of Maybloom; then a zone of bluebells, then of cowslips, then of lilacs, then of <b>ragged-robins,</b> daffodils, and so on, till the lowest stage was reached. Thomasin noticed all these, and was delighted that the May revel was to be so near.|$|R
60|$|Looking back at {{the great}} round hill from the village it is {{impossible}} not to notice the intense red colour of the road that winds over its green slope. One sometimes sees on a hillside a ploughed field of red earth which at a distance might easily be taken for a field of blossoming trifolium. Viewed nearer the crimson of the clover and red of the earth are very dissimilar; distance appears to intensify the red of the soil and to soften that of the flower until they are very nearly of the same hue. The road at Abbotsbury was near and looked to me more intensely red than any ordinary red earth, and the sight was strangely pleasing. These two complementary colours, red and green, delight us most when seen thus--a little red to {{a good deal of}} green, and the more luminous the red and vivid the green the better they please us. We see this in flowers--in the red geranium, for example--where there is no brown soil below, but green of turf or herbage. I sometimes think the red campions and <b>ragged-robins</b> are our most beautiful wild flowers when the sun shines level on the meadow and they are like crimson flowers among the tall translucent grasses. I remember the joy it was in boyhood in early spring when the flowers were beginning to bloom, when in our gallops over the level grass pampas we came upon a patch of scarlet verbenas. The first sight of the intense blooms scattered all about the turf would make us wild with delight, and throwing ourselves from our ponies we would go down among the flowers to feast on the sight.|$|R
