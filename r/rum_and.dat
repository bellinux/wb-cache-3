5|$|Most {{settlers}} in every colony were small farmers, but other industries developed {{within a few}} decades {{as varied as the}} settlements. Cash crops included tobacco, rice and wheat. Extraction industries grew up in furs, fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced <b>rum</b> <b>and</b> ships, and by the late colonial period Americans were producing one-seventh of the world's iron supply. Cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs. English colonists were supplemented by waves of Scotch-Irish and other groups. As coastal land grew more expensive, freed indentured servants pushed further west.|$|E

5|$|Vanilla tahitensis (Tahitian vanilla), {{which is}} a cross-strain of Vanilla planifola (Mexican vanilla and Bourbon vanilla) and Vanilla odorata (Inflated Vanilla), is {{produced}} in French Polynesia, especially in Tahiti, and also Hawaii. Its pods have fewer seeds than Vanilla planifolia, {{which is not a}} direct competitor. Mexican vanilla is used almost exclusively as the base of vanilla extract, due to higher vanillin levels. Tahitian vanilla is used primarily in perfume because of its coumarin-like scent. Other Tahitian vanilla products include vanilla green tea, vanilla oil, vanilla powder, vanilla <b>rum,</b> <b>and</b> vinegar-based vanilla.|$|E
5|$|Walsh was criticised in {{the press}} for what was seen as his {{excessive}} remuneration, but received admiration {{for his ability to}} build brands. He spent the majority of his career at Diageo and its precursor Grand Metropolitan.

5|$|Arya {{once again}} returns {{to watch the}} play {{featuring}} Lady Crane. She sneaks backstage during the last act and poisons Lady Crane's rum. As she attempts to leave, Lady Crane stops her, and they discuss acting and Lady Crane's early life. Back in the dressing room, Arya stops Lady Crane from drinking her <b>rum,</b> <b>and</b> warns her that her rival Bianca wants her dead. The scene is witnessed by the Waif, who returns to tell Jaqen H'ghar of Arya's failure. Jaqen gives the Waif permission to kill Arya, {{on the condition that}} Arya doesn't suffer. Meanwhile, Arya retrieves her sword, Needle, from the rocks where she had hidden it and takes it to her room.|$|E

5|$|Before the Revolution, New Englanders {{consumed}} {{large quantities}} of <b>rum</b> <b>and</b> beer as maritime trade provided relatively {{easy access to the}} goods needed to produce these items. Rum was the distilled spirit of choice as molasses, the main ingredient, was readily available from trade with the West Indies. In the continent's interior, colonists drank whiskey, as they had ready access to corn and rye but did not have good access to sugar cane. However, up until the Revolution, many colonists considered whiskey to be a coarse beverage unfit for human consumption, believing that it caused the poor to become raucous and disorderly.|$|E
5|$|The {{purchaser}} in the 1888 {{sale was}} John Bullough, a cotton machinery manufacturer (and self-made millionaire) from Accrington in Lancashire, {{who continued to}} use the island for recreational purposes. In the following year, counties were formally created in Scotland, on shrieval boundaries, by a dedicated Local Government Act; Rùm therefore {{became part of the}} new county of Argyll. When Bullough died in 1891 he was buried on Rùm, in a rock-cut mausoleum, under an octagonal stone tower. His heirs, however, felt that this was beneath his dignity, and demolished it, moving his sarcophagus into an elaborate mausoleum modelled as a Greek temple. Argyll, similarly, was not thought fitting for <b>Rùm,</b> <b>and</b> that same year was moved by boundary review to the county of Inverness, where Eigg already sat.|$|E
5|$|A popular food in Gangtok is the momo, a steamed {{dumpling}} containing pork, {{beef and}} vegetables cooked in a doughy wrapping {{and served with}} watery soup. Wai-Wai is a packaged snack consisting of noodles which are eaten either dry or in soup form. A form of noodle called thukpa, served in soup form is also popular in Gangtok. Other noodle-based foods such as the chowmein, thenthuk, fakthu, gyathuk and wonton are available. Other traditional Sikkimese cuisine include shah-phaley (Sikkimese patties with spiced minced meat in a crisp samosa-like case) and Gack-ko soup. Restaurants offer {{a wide variety of}} traditional Indian, continental and Chinese cuisines to cater to the tourists. Churpee, a kind of hard cheese made from cow's or yak's milk is sometimes chewed. Chhang is a local frothy millet beer traditionally served in bamboo tankards and drunk through bamboo or cane straws. Alcohol is cheap due to low excise duty in Sikkim. Beer, whiskey, <b>rum</b> <b>and</b> brandy are frequently consumed by both locals and non-locals.|$|E

50|$|An {{unrelated}} {{drink of}} the same name was served by Trader Vic's in the 1930s. It was a variation on the daiquiri, made using overproof Guyanese <b>and</b> Cuban <b>rums</b> <b>and</b> small amounts of curacao, creme de cacao, and sweet vermouth for additional flavor.|$|R
5|$|Complex taboos and rites are {{associated}} with a woman's first childbirth. When about to give birth she is secluded in a special birthing house called a komby. The leaves she eats from and the waste produced by the newborn are kept in a special receptacle for seven days, at which point they are burned. The ash produced is rubbed on the forehead and cheeks of the mother and baby and must be worn for seven days. On the fifteenth day both are bathed in water in which lime or lemon leaves have been soaked. This ritual is called ranom-boahangy (bath of the leaves). The community gathers to drink <b>rum</b> <b>and</b> celebrate with wrestling matches, but the mother must stay in the komby. She is not allowed to consume anything other than saonjo greens and a chicken specially prepared for her. After this celebration she is required to leave the komby and can return to routine life.|$|E
5|$|In 1832 {{the island}} was leased to Colonel Tynte of Halswell House, who {{established}} an inn for sailors. The inn was run by the Harris family, using <b>rum</b> <b>and</b> tobacco bought from ships. They claimed that {{the island was}} outside {{the jurisdiction of the}} excise men until a court case in 1884. After the Harris family, the inn was run by Mr W.L. Davies, who offered fishing, shooting and boating holidays. To make landing on the island easier, a new pier was built close to the inn. In 1835 clergyman John Ashley from Clevedon voluntarily ministered to the population of the island and the neighbouring Flat Holm. Ashley created the Bristol Channel Mission in order to serve seafarers on the 400 sailing vessels which used the Bristol Channel. The mission would later become the Mission to Seafarers, which still provides ministerial services to sailors in over 300 ports.|$|E
5|$|Several {{accounts}} {{indicate that}} during the Cherry Valley massacre or thereafter, Colonel Stacy was stripped naked and tied to a stake, {{and was about to}} be tortured and killed, as was the ritual for enemy warriors, but was spared by Joseph Brant. William Stacy was a Freemason; Joseph Brant was an educated American Indian, and had also become a Freemason. It is reported that Stacy made an appeal as one Freemason to another, thus saving his life. Colonel Stacy was subsequently taken to Fort Niagara, the Loyalist base in New York and held prisoner under Colonel Butler during the summer of 1779. At Fort Niagara, Molly Brant, the sister of Joseph Brant, was hostile toward Stacy, and wanted Colonel Butler to return custody of Stacy to the Indians. She proclaimed dreams of her and the Indians using Stacy's head in an Indian football game. Colonel Butler placated Molly Brant with <b>rum</b> <b>and</b> protected his prisoner. Subsequently, from late-1779 through mid-1782, Colonel Stacy was held prisoner at Fort Chambly near Montreal.|$|E
