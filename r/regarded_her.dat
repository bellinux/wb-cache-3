5|$|Potter's {{adolescence}} was a {{quiet as}} her childhood. She grew into a spinsterish young woman whose parents groomed {{her to be a}} permanent resident and housekeeper in their home. She wanted to lead a useful life independent of her parents and considered a career in mycology, but the all-male scientific community <b>regarded</b> <b>her</b> as an amateur and she abandoned fungi. She continued to paint and draw, and experienced her first professional artistic success in 1890 when she sold six designs of humanised animals to a greeting card publisher.|$|E

5|$|Two {{days after}} her defeat in the Derby, La Fleche ran against fillies in the Oaks. Although some <b>regarded</b> <b>her</b> as a certainty, her odds drifted from 2/5 to 8/11 before the start. In the race she tracked the leader Broad Corrie before taking {{the lead in the}} {{straight}} apparently poised for an easy victory. In the final furlong however, she was closely pressed by The Smew, a filly she had dealt with easily in the 1000 Guineas, and Barrett had to ride a vigorous finish to win the race by a short head. On 29 July at Goodwood, La Fleche won the Nassau Stakes in which, despite looking less than fully fit, she quickened impressively to bear Broad Corrie by a length and a half.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{training}} camp, {{a series of}} selection trials were held in Brisbane and Melbourne. In three 100-metre races, Morgan came third, fifth and fourth respectively, with a best time of 1 minute 7.3 seconds. She recorded a best performance of third {{in a time of}} 5 minutes 10.0 seconds in the 400-metre freestyle behind Crapp and Fraser. Australia was entitled to three representatives in each individual event, thus allowing Morgan to compete in her first Olympics. Morgan missed out in the 100-metre freestyle as Fraser, Crapp and Leech were selected, but she gained an individual berth in the 400-metre along with Fraser and Crapp. She was one of six swimmers selected for the 4Ã—100-metre freestyle relay squad, the first from Australia to compete at Olympic level. Morgan was placed under substantial pressure by media commentary that <b>regarded</b> <b>her</b> as the weak link in the relay team.|$|E

25|$|The marriage, however, {{was unhappy}} and childless. Aribert was {{homosexual}} and, perhaps {{after he was}} caught {{in bed with a}} man, the marriage was annulled on 13 December 1900 by his father. Princess Marie Louise, on an official visit to Canada at the time, immediately returned to Britain. According to her memoirs, she <b>regarded</b> <b>her</b> marriage vows as binding, so she never remarried.|$|E

25|$|Whiteread's casts {{often seem}} to emphasise {{the fact that}} the objects they {{represent}} are not themselves there, and critics have often <b>regarded</b> <b>her</b> work to be redolent of death and absence. Given this, it is perhaps not surprising that she was asked by Austrian authorities to create a work in remembrance of Austrian Jews killed during the Holocaust. Due to political sensitivities and bureaucracy the process, from commission to unveiling, took five years.|$|E
25|$|Kawashima was well-acquainted with Puyi, {{the last}} emperor of the Qing dynasty, who <b>regarded</b> <b>her</b> {{as a member}} of the {{imperial}} family and welcomed her into his household during his stay in Tianjin.

However, Kawashima privately criticised Puyi for being too amenable to Japanese influence.|$|E

25|$|John Launer's 2015 {{biography}} of Spielrein (in English) {{is based on}} close readings of her hospital notes, diaries and correspondence, and calls into question many of the received accounts about Spielrein. He challenges the presumption that Jung psychoanalyzed Spielrien in any systematic way, reciprocated her feelings for long, saw her as his 'anima', or <b>regarded</b> <b>her</b> as a more significant figure than his other female partners of the time. Instead, Launer sees her historical importance as someone who made an early attempt to harmonize psychoanalysis and developmental psychology within an overarching biological framework, anticipating modern ideas from attachment theory and evolutionary psychology.|$|E
25|$|She was {{subsequently}} charged and {{convicted of murder}} and illegally crossing Russian state border despite being abducted from Ukrainian territory one hour before {{the deaths of the}} journalists. One of her lawyers, Mark Feygin, said she was a prisoner-of-war and called on the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations to demand her immediate release and that of the other Ukrainian POWs lest Russia be held in violation of the Geneva Conventions. European Union ministers and their representative <b>regarded</b> <b>her</b> detention as illegal and that her trial did not respect basic human rights, including the right to fair proceedings.|$|E
25|$|After the remarriage, Auchincloss' Merrywood {{estate in}} McLean, Virginia became the Bouvier sisters' primary residence, {{although}} they also spent time at his other estate, Hammersmith Farm in Newport, Rhode Island, {{and in their}} father's homes in New York City and Long Island. Although she retained a relationship with her father, Bouvier also <b>regarded</b> <b>her</b> stepfather as a close paternal figure. He gave her a stable environment and the pampered childhood she never would have experienced otherwise. While Bouvier adjusted to her mother's remarriage, she sometimes felt like an outsider in the WASP social circle of the Auchinclosses, attributing the feeling to her being Catholic {{as well as being}} a child of divorce, which was not common in that social group at that time.|$|E

25|$|Sarada Devi {{was born}} in Jayrambati. At {{the age of five}} she was betrothed to Ramakrishna, whom she joined at Dakshineswar Kali temple when she was in her late teens. According to her {{traditional}} biographers, both lived lives of unbroken continence, showing the ideals of a householder and of the monastic ways of life. After Ramakrishna's death, Sarada Devi stayed most of the time either at Jayrambati or at the Udbodhan office, Calcutta. The disciples of Ramakrishna <b>regarded</b> <b>her</b> as their own mother, and after their guru's death looked to her for advice and encouragement. The followers of the Ramakrishna movement and a large section of devotees across the world worship Sri Sri Ma Sarada Devi as an incarnation of the Adi Parashakti or the Divine Mother.|$|E
25|$|As {{it could}} be expected, when they arrived on 13 August, Marie was disillusioned. The house, {{contained}} within {{the ruins of a}} former monastery, was in disrepair, damp and rat-infested. Her in-laws were peasants who disgusted her and <b>regarded</b> <b>her</b> with deep distrust. Instead of the wealth she expected, she was faced with considerable debt. In her despondency, she locked herself in her room the first night and wrote a letter to her husband, imploring him to release her from their marriage, while threatening to take her life with arsenic. Lafarge, whose affairs were desperate, agreed to make concessions except to release her from the marriage. He promised not to assert his marital privileges until he restored the estate to its original condition. She appeared to calm down, and their relationship appeared to have improved in the ensuing weeks.|$|E
25|$|Around 1719 {{it seems}} that an illness caused her voice to drop {{from that of a}} soprano to that of a contralto. Upon the {{formation}} of Handel's Royal Academy of Music in 1720, Robinson was engaged on a yearly salary of Â£1000 and originated many new roles, most notably Zenobia (Radamisto), Irene (Muzio Scevola), Elmira (Floridante), Matilda (Ottone), Teodata (Flavio) and, most famously of all, the pathos-filled role of Cornelia in Giulio Cesare. She also sang in works by Bononcini and Ariosti, {{as well as a number}} of pasticcios. Soon after the premiere of Giulio Cesare in February 1724 she retired from the stage. In 1722 (or possibly 1723) she had secretly married Charles Mordaunt, 3rd Earl of Peterborough, although he did not acknowledge her status as his wife until 1735, just before his death; until then they lived separately, and society <b>regarded</b> <b>her</b> as his mistress.|$|E
