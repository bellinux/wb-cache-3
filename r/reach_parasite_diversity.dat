Most studies {{to date have}} investigated patterns within trophic levels, reflecting a lack of food webs which include information on energy flow. We added parasites to a published marine energy-flow food web, to explore whether <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> is correlated with energy flow to host taxa. <b>Parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> was high with 36 parasite taxa affecting 40 of the 51 animal taxa. Adding parasites {{increased the number of}} trophic links per species, trophic link strength, connectance, and food chain lengths. There was evidence of an asymptotic relationship between energy flowing through a food chain and <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity,</b> although there were clear outliers. High <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> was associated with host taxa which were highly connected within the food web. This suggests that energy flow through a taxon may favour <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity,</b> up to a maximal value. The evolutionary and energetic basis for that limitation is of key interest in understanding the basis for <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> in natural food webs and thus their role in food web dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Host-parasite {{evolutionary}} {{interactions are}} typically considered in a pairwise species framework. However, natural infections frequently involve multiple <b>parasites.</b> Altering <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> alters ecological and evolutionary dynamics as parasites compete and hosts resist multiple infection. We investigated {{the effects of}} <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> on host-parasite population dynamics and evolution using the pathogen P. aeruginosa and five lytic bacteriophage parasites. To manipulate <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity,</b> bacterial populations were exposed for 24 hours to either phage monocultures or diverse communities containing up to five phages. Phage communities suppressed host populations more rapidly but also showed reduced phage density, likely due to inter-phage competition. The evolution of resistance allowed rapid bacterial recovery that was greater in magnitude with increases in phage diversity. We observed {{no difference in the}} extent of resistance with increased <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity,</b> but there was a profound impact on the specificity of resistance; specialized resistance evolved to monocultures through mutations in a diverse set of genes. In summary, we demonstrate that <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> has rapid effects on host-parasite population dynamics and evolution by selecting for different resistance mutations and affecting the magnitude of bacterial suppression and recovery. Finally, we discuss the implications of phage diversity for their use as biological control agents...|$|R

We then performed a stepwise linear regression of each diversity index on these variables, to find a minimal subset of statistically significant variables that account for the variation in each diversity index. We found that most <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> indices increase with the mean distance to urban centres, or in other words, foxes in more rural provinces have a more diverse helminth fauna. Sampling effort and fox presence probability (probably related to fox density) also appeared as conditioning variables for some indices, as well as soil permeability (related with water availability).

In particular, simultaneous infections from multiple parasite species should cause diversification (i. e. balancing selection) in resistance genes both at the population and the individual level. Here, we tested these ideas in highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes from three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.). In eight natural populations, <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> (15 different species), and MHC class IIB diversity varied strongly between habitat types (lakes vs. rivers vs. estuaries) with lowest values in rivers. Partial correlation analysis revealed an influence of <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> on MHC class IIB variation whereas general genetic diversity assessed at seven microsatellite loci was not significantly correlated with <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity.</b> Within individual fish, intermediate, rather than maximal allele numbers were associated with minimal parasite load, supporting theoretical models of self-reactive T-cell elimination.

Individuals belonging to groups with a high risk of infection, as deduced by clinical epidemiology, did not harbour a higher number of clones per infection, nor greater <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> than low-risk groups.

Our results show that the topology of the food web in each brackish marsh is highly nested, with clusters of generalists forming a distinct modular structure. The most consistent predictors of <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> within a host were: trophic generality, and eigenvector centrality. These metrics indicate that parasites preferentially colonise host species that are highly connected, and within modules of tightly interacting species in the food web network. Conclusions/Significance: These results suggest that highly connected free-living species within the food web may represent stable trophic relationships that allow for the persistence of complex parasite life cycles.

Levels of parasitism and <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> were significantly greater in native fishes than in exotic species, and this may contribute to an enhanced demographic performance and competitive ability in invading exotics. Levels of parasitism and <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> in native fishes were negatively related to habitat disturbance, in particular to a suite of factors that indicate increased human use of the river and surrounding environment.

40|$|The {{patterns}} and {{mechanisms by which}} biological diversity is associated with parasite infection risk are important to study because of their potential implications for wildlife population's conservation and management. Almost all {{research in this area}} has focused on host species diversity and has neglected <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity,</b> despite evidence that parasites are important drivers of community structure and ecosystem processes. Here, we assessed whether presence or abundance of each of nine helminth species parasitizing lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens) was associated with indices of <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> (i. e. species richness and Shannon's Diversity Index). We found repeated instances of focal parasite presence and abundance having significant positive co-variation with diversity measures of other parasites. These results occurred both within individual samples and for combinations of all samples.

We rectify this by quantifying the numbers and proportion of parasitic species. We estimate that there are between 75, 000 and 300, 000 helminth species parasitizing the vertebrates. We have no credible way of estimating how many parasitic protozoa, fungi, bacteria, and viruses exist.

Because patterns of <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> do not clearly map onto patterns of host diversity, we can make very little prediction about geographical patterns of threat to parasites.

40|$|Plasmodium falciparum, {{the most}} virulent human malaria parasite, {{undergoes}} asexual reproduction within the human host, but reproduces sexually within its vector host, the Anopheles mosquito. Consequently, the mosquito {{stage of the}} parasite life cycle provides an opportunity to create genetically novel parasites in multiply-infected mosquitoes, potentially increasing <b>parasite</b> population <b>diversity.</b> Despite the important implications for disease transmission and malaria control, a quantitative mapping of how <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> entering a mosquito relates to <b>diversity</b> of the <b>parasite</b> exiting, has not been undertaken. To examine the role that vector biology plays in modulating <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity,</b> we develop a two-part model framework that estimates the diversity {{as a consequence of}} different bottlenecks and expansion events occurring during the vector-stage of the parasite life cycle. For the underlying framework, we develop the first stochastic model of within-vector P. falciparum parasite dynamics and go on to simulate the dynamics of two parasite subpopulations, emulating multiply infected mosquitoes. We show that incorporating stochasticity is essential to capture the extensive variation in parasite dynamics, particularly in the presence of multiple parasites. In particular, unlike deterministic models, which always predict the most fit parasites to produce the most sporozoites, we find that occasionally only parasites with lower fitness survive to the sporozoite stage. This has important implications for onward transmission. The second part of our framework includes a model of sequence diversity generation resulting from recombination and reassortment between parasites within a mosquito. Our two-part model framework shows that bottlenecks entering the oocyst stage decrease <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> from what is present in the initial gametocyte population in a mosquito's blood meal. However, diversity increases with the possibility for recombination and proliferation in the formation of sporozoites.

We predicted that pesticide pollution and landscape development would be significant factors shaping the parasite communities and populations. <b>Parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> and species richness were lower in wetlands impacted by both pesticides and land use.

40|$|Many parasites exhibit {{antigenic}} variation within their hosts. We use mathematical models {{to investigate the}} dynamical interaction between an antigenically varying parasite and the host's immune system.

Analysis of the models allows us to evaluate {{the relative importance of}} variant-specific and cross-reactive immune responses in controlling the parasite. Early in the course of infection within the host, when <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> is below a defined threshold value (the value is determined by the biological properties of the parasite and of the host's immune response), the variant-specific immune responses are predominant. Later, when the <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> is high, the cross-reactive immune response is largely responsible for controlling the parasitemia. It is argued that increasing antigenic diversity leads to a switch from variant-specific to cross-reactive immune responses.

40|$|Parasite–host coevolutionary {{races are}} {{spatially}} variable across species’ or human cultural ranges. Assortative sociality, biased toward local conspecifics, and limited dispersal (philopatry) in humans and other organisms can be adaptive through reduced contact with dangerous contagions harbored by distant/non-local conspecifics. These factors can generate cultural or population divergence. Thus, parasites {{are like a}} wedge driving groups apart through their effective creation of anticontagion behaviors.

First we show here that parasitism is non-random in food webs. Second we demonstrate that <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity,</b> the number of parasite species harboured by a host species, is related to the network position of a host species. Specifically, a host species with high <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> tends to have a wide diet range, occupy a network position close to many prey species, or occupy a network position that can better accumulate resources from species at lower trophic levels. Lastly our results also suggest that a host species with higher vulnerability to predators, being at a network position close to many predatory species, or being involved in many different food chains, tends to be important in parasite transmission. Parasites are organisms that live in other organisms, hosts, from which they obtain nutrients (Marcogliese and Cone 1997, Bush et al. 2002).

First, surveys of <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> are accumulating at a much higher rate in temperate areas than in the tropics.

We used Bayesian statistics and 95 % credible intervals for each parameter tested were calculated. Fish studied harbored a total of 15 different species of <b>parasites.</b> <b>Diversity</b> of <b>parasite</b> species found on Mugil liza was greatest at the S. R. C. collection site, but evidenced a lower species richness than at A. R. site. The 1 st size fishes of both sites evidenced greater <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> than either 2 nd or 3 rd size fish. Differences observed could be explained by the different use of habitat types at the two sites or differential susceptibility to infection by parasites. The dominance of D. fastigatainfluenced observed results of lower community diversity indexes. New works elucidating different parasite life cycles within juvenile and adults ofM. liza in Argentina, promise to be important for determining the risk of the parasitism by zoonotic metacercariae A. (P.) longa and use of this fish as food and an economic resource, and the possible use of mullet parasites in other promising fields as indicators of biodiversity, and/ or water contamination...|$|R
40|$|Current {{methods used}} to predict {{parasite}} biodiversity do not consider that both the distribution of parasite species richness per host species, {{and the distribution of}} the number of host species used by a parasite species are severely skewed. Here we propose a new, more refined approach that estimates parasite richness by randomly resampling the existing databases in order to model the relationship between the number of examined hosts and the number of parasites species retrieved. We applied this method to several large host-parasite lists, demonstrating that current predictions are likely to overestimate global <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity.</b> JRC.

40|$|Malaria infections {{commonly}} contain multiple genetically distinct variants. Mathematical {{and animal}} models suggest that interactions among these variants {{have a profound}} impact on the emergence of drug resistance. However, methods currently used for quantifying <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> in individual infections are insensitive to low-abundance variants and are not quantitative for variant population sizes. To more completely describe the in-host complexity and ecology of malaria infections, we used massively parallel pyrosequencing to characterize malaria <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> in the infections of a group of patients. By individually sequencing single strands of DNA in a complex mixture, this technique can quantify uncommon variants in mixed infections. The in-host diversity revealed by this method far exceeded that described by currently recommended genotyping methods, with as many as sixfold more variants per infection. In addition, in paired pre- and posttreatment samples, we show a complex milieu of parasites, including variants likely up-selected and down-selected by drug therapy. As with all surveys of diversity, sampling limitations prevent full discovery and differences in sampling effort can confound comparisons among samples, hosts, and populations. Here, we used ecological approaches of species accumulation curves and capture-recapture to estimate the number of variants we failed to detect in the population, and show that these methods enable comparisons of diversity before and after treatment, as well as between malaria populations. The combination of ecological statistics and massively parallel pyrosequencing provides a powerful tool for studying the evolution of drug resistance and the in-host ecology of malaria infections...|$|R
40|$|Although {{research}} on parasite biodiversity has intensified recently, {{there are signs}} that parasites remain an underestimated component of total biodiversity in many regions of the planet. To identify geographical hotspots of <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity,</b> we performed qualitative and quantitative analyses of the parasite-host associations in fishes from Latin America and the Caribbean, a region that includes known hotspots of plant and animal biodiversity. The database included 10 904 metazoan parasite-host associations involving 1660 fish species. The number of host species with at least 1 parasite record was less than 10 % of the total known fish species in the majority of countries. Associations involving adult endoparasites in actinopterygian fish hosts dominated the database. Across the whole region, no significant difference in parasite species richness was detected between marine and freshwater fishes. As a rule, host body size and study effort (number of studies per fish species) were good predictors of parasite species richness. Some interesting patterns emerged when we included only the regions with highest fish species biodiversity and study effort (Brasil, Mexico and the Caribbean Islands). Independently of differences in study effort or host body sizes, Mexico stands out as a hotspot of <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> for freshwater fishes, as does Brasil for marine fishes. However, among 57 marine fish species common to all 3 regions, populations from the Caribbean consistently harbouredmore parasite species. These differences may reflect true biological patterns, or regional discrepancies in study effort and local priorities for fish parasitology research...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring {{therapeutic}} {{efficacy of}} antimalarial drugs {{is important because}} treatment failure rates are the primary basis for changing antimalarial treatment policy. An important aspect of efficacy studies {{is the use of}} PCR genotyping to distinguish recrudescent from new infections. The conclusions reached using this technique might be misleading if there is insufficient <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> or a non-uniform haplotype frequency distribution in the study area. Statistical techniques can be used to overcome this problem, but only when data describing the haplotype frequency distribution are available. Therefore, assessing haplotype frequency and distribution should form an integral part of all studies investigating the therapeutic efficacy of antimalarial treatment regimes...|$|R
