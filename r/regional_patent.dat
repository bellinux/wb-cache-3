40|$|The {{research}} question {{of this paper}} is related to existing findings in the literature, which have already discovered several aspects of spatial regime effects in regional knowledge production. Our focus is on the effect of participation in FP projects and the resulting knowledge flows on <b>regional</b> <b>patenting</b> activity. Wouldn’t it be the case that the missing evidence on a direct knowledge transfer impact on patenting mediated by FP participations masks important and regular spatial differences in Europe? Influenced by earlier findings in the literature in this paper we hypothesize that the direct impact of knowledge transfers between FP network partners on <b>regional</b> <b>patenting</b> follows different trends in core and peripheral regions in Europe. As {{to the nature of the}} expected differences in the trends there are no antecedents in the literature that could guide us to formulate one single hypothesis. Consequently, the hypothesis that lagging areas are not yet equipped to utilize learning from FP research networks in patenting because of their low levels of absorptive capacities can be raised with a chance similar to that of the other, which states that FP subsidies are only substitutes for other research funds in core EU regions and as such do not influence patenting...|$|R

A region's own R&D activities and human capital are observed to have a positive significant effect on innovation output, measured by the number of patents. R&D spillovers weighted by the distance and the volume of trade flows between regions cause positive effects on a region's patents. However, distance matters more than the intensity of trade flows and the R&D spillover effects between regions are bounded: spillovers from closer regions perform better than spillovers from distant regions. On the opposite side, human capital spillovers do not cause any effect outside the region itself...|$|R

We identify the strength of industry technology leaders as dominant players in regional R&D from the concentration of <b>regional</b> <b>patenting</b> activity among local firms and control for the size of the regional technology cluster. Our preliminary results clearly indicate that while the strength of local relevant technology clusters attracts cross-border R&D projects, investors are discouraged by concentration of technology activities by regional industry leaders.

40|$|We analyse the {{innovative}} activity of European {{regions in the}} fields of biotechnology and semiconductor technology. We explain <b>regional</b> <b>patenting</b> levels from publication levels within each region and nearby regions to account for local knowledge spillovers. We extend this approach by including connectivity measures for each region in order to indicate their position in the pan-European networks of Internet backbone providers, airline routes and global banks. We hypothesise that a region's position in all these networks contributes to its innovation capability as these networks provide high-quality and relative cheap access to digital information (Internet), fellow researchers (airlines) and financial resources (banks). The results show that connectivity indeed supports a region's patenting level in science-based technologies. In particular, we found that connectivity through the Internet backbone and through global banks enhance innovative activity, while airline connectivity does not. A second conclusion holds that while local knowledge spillovers are found to be very strong for patenting in biotechnology, this effect is found to be absent in semiconductor patenting.
