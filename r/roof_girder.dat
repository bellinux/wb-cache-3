40|$|In the {{calculation}} {{model of the}} equivalent stabilizing force qd for bracing system consistent with EN 1993 - 1 - 1 it has been conservatively assumed that the member to be restrained is uniformly compressed within its length by an axial force. This assumption is incorrect owing to the actual distribution of the axial force which is non-uniform {{in the shape of}} parabola. Thus a different imperfection force is generated in comparison with this given in EN 1993 - 1 - 1.

30|$|Since {{the weight}} of the roof and the roof frame members {{correspond}} to vertical load, as described above, these loads were determined from the measured weight values of those members discharged during the demolition. As shown in Figs.  1 a and 2, the front eaves consisted of a large overhang from the roof frame. The load of the overhanging section was supported with a horizontal bridging member, called “Hanegi”. When examining the structure of the roof frame, it was confirmed that this load did not affect the strain measurement on the <b>roof</b> <b>girder.</b> In other words, since both the load of the roof frame and the load of the overhanging roof are included in total discharge weight above, those should be separated. The overhanging sections were partitioned in proportion to the projected areas ratio on the horizontal plane from the roof frame and non-over-hanging section. The area portion of the non-overhanging section is 47.8  % and from this, the load of the non-overhanging section was estimated. By multiplying this value with the 14.3  % load-sharing percentage of the vertical frame including the <b>roof</b> <b>girder</b> used in strain measurement, the vertical load used in the analysis could be calculated. Corresponding to each strain measurement day shown in Table  2, the stress analysis was carried out by allocating loads to the roof and the roof frame according to the demolition conditions during the strain measurement day. Sequentially {{from the top of the}} roof frame, {{the weight of}} a vertical member and the load between the vertical members at one layer above were taken as the vertical load. Although the actual demolition progressed locally and independently in both the vertical and horizontal planes rather than evenly (on average), this point was not considered in this analysis.|$|E

In order to design the cable geometry and the biasing force, it was crucial to take into account shear resistance as well as constraining compressive stress in the concrete.

30|$|The Young’s moduli of all 32 <b>roof</b> <b>girders</b> and 7 <b>roof</b> {{vertical}} struts (6 {{of these}} were subject to strain measurement) inside the roof frame were estimated using the stress wave propagation velocity measurement prior to the demolition (2009 December). A portable resonant-type stress wave propagation timer (FAKOPP) {{was used for the}} measurement of the stress wave propagation velocity. To avoid the influence of mortises and other members for both <b>roof</b> <b>girders</b> and vertical <b>roof</b> struts on the stress wave measurement, it was ensured that the joints were not within the stress wave propagation range of the placed sensors. The measuring distance of stress wave was taken in a length range as far as possible. Therefore, the measuring distance for each member is different. As shown in Table  1, the average measuring distances for <b>roof</b> <b>girders</b> and <b>roof</b> vertical struts were 5829 and 513  mm, respectively. To obtain stable values, the average values for stress wave propagation time were determined by measuring those at each position three times. The propagation velocity, V, was calculated using the average propagation time and the measuring distance. In this study, we adopted the method of estimating the Young’s modulus using only the propagation velocity without measuring the density. That is, using the Monte Carlo simulation method based on the existing database of mechanical properties of Japanese lumbers [5], the Young’s modulus, E, was estimated from the propagation velocity; refer to the Ref. [5] for the detailed method. The database of mechanical properties for estimation purposes is currently being accumulated in research institutes across Japan, and data for the relationship between Young’s modulus of softwood lumber in full scale and its density exist. In this study, the database of “ALL” (means the database including data of all species; n =  12967) was employed [6]; refer to the Ref. [6] for the detailed information. As described above, the moisture content on the surface of members was assumed to be 10  % although it was impossible to measure the overall moisture content of the material. Overall moisture content was taken to be a value lower than 15  %, a typical air-dry moisture content of Japan. It has been reported that the moisture content on the surface of old materials decreases over time [7]: therefore, the measured moisture content for old materials in this study was considered to be at the normal air-dry state. As this study intended to investigate the stress state at the present time, moisture content correction for the stress wave propagation velocity and the estimation of Young’s modulus was not considered.|$|R

However, its challenging site made plans for expansion difficult. A solution was proposed by Schwartz/Silver Architects - to suspend the floor from <b>roof</b> <b>girders.</b> These support {{the weight of the}} books from above, allowing the elimination of floor beams to maximize the narrow site. Six floors fit into the same space as the four of the original building, while still allowing for a 17-foot clearance for a truck turnaround below. A narrow, sky-lit atrium between the old building and the addition allows sunlight to reach offices and studios in the upper floors, mitigating entire elimination of views and natural light. The result is an addition that has been referred to as a ‘glass cage,’ which contains the stacks, limited-access collection, and exhibition gallery, while the renovated Bosworth building holds the main reading room and administrative offices.|$|R
