500|$|Unlike {{many of its}} relatives, the {{mangrove}} whipray {{is reportedly}} solitary in nature.

Juveniles feed mainly on small crustaceans, including prawns and crabs. Adults prey on small benthic bony fishes, including <b>rabbitfishes,</b> gobies, blennies, wrasses, and damselfishes, as well as invertebrates, including peanut worms, crabs, octopuses, and bivalves. As in all stingrays, the mangrove whipray is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos being sustained by nutrient-rich histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to (1) estimate the effects of polyculture of blue shrimp Litopenaeus stylirostris with goldlined <b>rabbitfish</b> Siganus lineatus on production, environmental quality and water and sediment metabolism and (2) to determine if blue shrimp and goldlined <b>rabbitfish</b> polyculture is possible. The experiment was carried out for 12 weeks in a mesocosm system that consisted of 12 circular outdoor mesocosm fiberglass tanks (1. 7 m 2, 1275 L water volume). Shrimp (2. 9 g) were randomly stocked at density of 15 shrimp. m− 2 without <b>rabbitfish</b> (control), with <b>rabbitfish</b> (25. 5 g) at low density (1. 2 fish. m− 2) (LDRB) and high density (2. 4 fish. m− 2) (HDRB). Results indicated that goldlined <b>rabbitfish</b> S. lineatus did not affect shrimp growth performance. At the end of the experiment, the combined shrimp and <b>rabbitfish</b> yields in the LDRB (213 g. m− 2) treatment and the HDRB (295 g. m− 2) treatment were significantly greater (P 0. 05) in gross primary productivity and respiration between the HDRB treatment and the control. It was concluded that the polyculture of blue shrimp with goldlined <b>rabbitfish</b> is technically possible without degradation of the environment in the culture system...|$|R

50|$|<b>Rabbitfishes</b> or spinefoots are perciform fishes in {{the family}} Siganidae. The 28 species are in a single genus, Siganus. In some now {{obsolete}} classifications, the species having prominent face stripes - colloquially called foxfaces - are in the genus Lo. Other species, such as the masked spinefoot (S. puellus), show a reduced form of the stripe pattern. <b>Rabbitfishes</b> are native to shallow waters in the Indo-Pacific, but S. luridus and S. rivulatus have become established in the eastern Mediterranean via Lessepsian migration.

40|$|We {{report the}} isolation, cDNA cloning, and growth {{promoting}} activity of <b>rabbitfish</b> (Siganus guttatus; Teleostei; Perciformes; Siganidae) growth hormone (GH). <b>Rabbitfish</b> GH was extracted from pituitary glands under alkaline conditions, fractionated by {{gel filtration chromatography}} on Sephadex G- 100, and purified by high-performance liquid chromatography. The fractions containing GH were identified by immunoblotting with bonito GH antiserum. Under nonreducing conditions, the molecular weight of <b>rabbitfish</b> GH is about 19 kDa as estimated by SDSâ€“PAGE. The purified hormone was potent in promoting growth in <b>rabbitfish</b> fry. Weekly intraperitoneal injections of the hormone significantly accelerated growth. This was evident 3 weeks {{after the start of}} the treatment, and its effect was still significant 2 weeks after the treatment was terminated. <b>Rabbitfish</b> GH cDNA was cloned to determine its nucleotide sequence. Excluding the poly (A) tail, <b>rabbitfish</b> GH cDNA is 860 base pairs (bp) long. It contained untranslated regions of 94 and 175 bp in the 5 â€² and 3 â€² ends, respectively. It has an open reading frame of 588 bp coding for a signal peptide of 18 amino acids and a mature protein of 178 amino acid residues. <b>Rabbitfish</b> GH has 4 cysteine residues.

40|$|This paper reviews studies {{conducted}} on milkfish (Chanos chanos), <b>rabbitfish</b> (Siganus guttatus), and mullet (Mugil cephalus) at the SEAFDEC Aquaculture Department from 1968 to 1991. Milkfish studies focused on hormonal induction of off-season gonadal maturation, dietary manipulation of milkfish broodstock to improve egg and larval quality, improvement of larval rearing techniques for mass fry production and technology {{transfer to the}} private sector, and search for a low-cost, practical diet for milkfish and a supplemental diet to increase pond production. Preliminary success on alternate feed for larval rearing and spontaneous maturation of milkfish in concrete tanks may help alleviate milkfish fry supply in the future. Studies on <b>rabbitfish</b> centered on improvement of larval survival and search for the optimum diet for growth of <b>rabbitfish</b> fry and juveniles reared in ponds. The difficulty in rearing <b>rabbitfish</b> larvae due to high mortality at first week after hatching hinders {{the development of the}} <b>rabbitfish</b> industry. Research involving mullet was solely on the establishment of broodstock for fish propagation...|$|R
5000|$|All <b>rabbitfish</b> have large, {{dark eyes}} and small, {{somewhat}} rabbit-like mouths, which gives them their name. Most species have either bright colors or a complex pattern. The largest <b>rabbitfish</b> grows to about 53 cm, but most species only reach between 25 and 35 cm.|$|R
5000|$|Another unusual feature among <b>rabbitfishes</b> {{is their}} pelvic fins, which are formed from two spines, with three soft rays between them.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare the effects of shrimp and <b>rabbitfish</b> in mono- and polyculture stocked at high biomass on production and environmental conditions in a mesocosm system. Shrimp (14 g) and/or <b>rabbitfish</b> (19 g) were stocked in four treatments with different density but with the same total biomass (236 g m− 2), including shrimp monoculture (SM) (17 shrimp m− 2), shrimp–fish polyculture (SF) (11 shrimp and 4 <b>rabbitfish</b> m− 2), fish–shrimp polyculture (FS) (6 shrimp and 8 <b>rabbitfish</b> m− 2) and fish monoculture (FM) (12 <b>rabbitfish</b> m− 2). After 10 weeks of experiment, shrimp survival and biomass were low in the treatments where shrimp were dominant (SM, SF), while <b>rabbitfish</b> survival and biomass were high in all the treatments. Shrimp mortality was assumed to be related to an excess of the system carrying capacity (CC). Results suggested that CC is linked to shrimp biomass/density rather than the system eutrophication level. The ecosystem became heterotrophic as daily feed supply was beyond 7 g m− 2 per day. This threshold corresponded to the environmental CC of the semi-intensive shrimp culture system. Under these conditions, the combination of high fish biomass and low shrimp biomass appeared as the most valuable in terms of system performances...|$|R
