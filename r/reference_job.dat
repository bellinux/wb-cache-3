40|$|AbstractAmong {{occupational}} {{risk factors of}} recurrence, chronicity and no return to work in low back pain, poor job satisfaction is the only high evidence-based factor. ObjectiveTo find out any validated questionnaire usable to assess job satisfaction in low back pain patients, both in clinical practice and research setting. MethodA systematic literature search on Pubmed and Cochrane library databases and un-indexed literature was made. “Job satisfaction” and “low back pain” keywords were used. Only English and French relevant articles were retained. A double assessment was made of listed questionnaires according to psychometric properties and daily practice use. ResultsAmong the 40 articles retained only four used a validated questionnaire. Among the 12 different questionnaires, only two are validated in their English version (Job Descriptive Index [JDI] and the Work Environment Scale [WES]) and one in its French Version (JDI). Because they are time consuming, use these questionnaires in daily practice seems difficult. ConclusionBased on literature review and questionnaire heterogeneity, at this time, there is no <b>reference</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction questionnaire. For daily practice, global job satisfaction visual analog scale could be useful. For research and intervention, JDI is more suitable despite its validity is still questionable...|$|E
