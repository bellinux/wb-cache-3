There, he helped <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> Hungarian Scout Association within his native country.|$|E
5|$|Projects in the United States {{during the}} late 1940s allowed Raymond to gain a {{foothold}} in occupied Japan. This helped to <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> building boom in occupied Japan after the war. This was mainly achieved through contacts made in his previous practice and those that he and Rado made in New York.|$|E
5|$|After initial aliveness {{testing that}} showed no issues, STIS {{was taken into}} {{functional}} testing, and issues were seen when the telescope put itself into safe mode due to a low thermal limit sensor. Ground controllers at Goddard would <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> testing once the thermal limit sensor was back in normal sensor range, but it is believed the component is in good shape.|$|E

He landed {{the ball on the}} head of Sheringham who nodded it to Solskjær who in turn toe-poked it into the roof of the net. Oliver Kahn, the Bayern goalkeeper, was motionless on the line. United had completed the come-back. Bayern barely had time to <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> game, which referee Collina brought to a close just a few seconds later.|$|E
5|$|Carter's {{time at the}} Naval Academy was {{not without}} success; in his second year, he singlehandedly managed to <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> school's {{football}} program after a two-year hiatus. Carter guided his team as a player-coach for the season, leading them to a victory over students from Johns Hopkins University, the first win in school history.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} services, the Congolese Air Force is {{not capable of}} {{carrying}} out its responsibilities. Few of the Air Force's aircraft are currently flyable or capable of being restored to service and {{it is unclear whether}} the Air Force is capable of maintaining even unsophisticated aircraft. Moreover, Jane's states that the Air Force's Ecole de Pilotage is 'in near total disarray' though Belgium has offered to <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> Air Force's pilot training program.|$|E

5|$|Paramount {{turned down}} several {{proposals}} in the mid-2000s to <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> franchise. These included pitches from film director Bryan Singer, Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski, and Trek actors Jonathan Frakes and William Shatner. The studio also {{turned down an}} animated web series. Instead, Paramount hired a new creative team to reinvigorate the franchise in 2007. Writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman and Lost producer, J. J. Abrams, had the freedom to reinvent the feel of Trek.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} game's release in North America, a game-breaking glitch was {{discovered}} in the Nintendo 3DS version: saving the game in specific Escape sections would corrupt the saved game's data, forcing the player to <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> game from the beginning. In response, Aksys Games recommended that players avoid saving during Escape sections. By 2013, Aksys Games announced that the glitch had been patched in the Nintendo eShop version, but some players continued to report that the glitch still existed.|$|E
5|$|After 20 years, Bánáthy {{left the}} renamed Defense Language Institute {{and went to}} work for the Far West Laboratory for Research and Development in Berkeley and later San Francisco. He retired from Far West in 1989 but {{maintained}} an active interest in social systems and science, including attending many conferences and advising students and others in those fields. In 1992, he helped <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> Hungarian Scout Association within his native country. In 2003, Bánáthy and Eva moved to live with their son Tibor in Chico, California. After a brief and unexpected illness, Bánáthy died on September 4, 2003.|$|E

5000|$|After {{reaching}} an ending, the player has <b>the</b> option of <b>restarting</b> <b>the</b> game {{to try to}} [...] "save the homeland" [...] again, possibly achieving a different ending. Upon <b>restarting</b> <b>the</b> year the player may keep the money and animals earned. Each time the player finds a new ending, it gets saved in the Endings List, and the player receives the profiles of the villagers involved in that ending.|$|R
50|$|For 1968, Lincoln <b>restarted</b> <b>the</b> Mark {{series with}} the Mark III. Instead of being a {{flagship}} model of the standard Lincoln, the Mark III was an all-new car. Based upon the Ford Thunderbird, it was a strict personal-luxury coupe like the Continental Mark II and the 1939-1948 Continental, thus <b>restarting</b> <b>the</b> series at Mark III.|$|R
5|$|Defeating monsters earns the {{character}} experience points, and after earning enough points, {{the character}} will gain an experience level, improving their hit points, magic capability, and other attributes. Monsters may drop treasure to be looted. On the other hand, the character dies {{if they lose}} all their hit points. As most roguelikes feature the concept of permadeath, this represents {{the end of the}} game, and the player will need to <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> game with a newly made character. Roguelikes are nearly always turn-based, with the game only reacting when the player makes an action with the character. This allows players to evaluate a difficult situation, such as being cornered by several monsters, at their own pace and determine the best strategy.|$|E
5|$|From 3 June to 30 September 1960, Braathens SAFE {{was granted}} {{concession}} {{on the route}} from Oslo via Sandefjord Airport, Torp to Aalborg Airport in Denmark. This became possible because SAS had abandoned the route the previous year. It was flown with a DC-3, giving an 80% load factor. On 22 July, the Braathens SAFE applied for a three-year concession, but this was rejected because SAS stated that they would <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> route. In 1961, SAS started the route Stavanger–Kristiansand–Ålborg, and in 1963 on the route Oslo–Kristiansand–Ålborg. The concession allowed SAS to also take passengers on the domestic legs, giving Braathens SAFE competition on the routes to Kristiansand.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, {{both the}} Cunard Line and the White Star Line were {{experiencing}} financial difficulties. David Kirkwood, MP for Clydebank where the unfinished hull 534 {{had been sitting}} idle {{for two and a}} half years, made a passionate plea in the House of Commons for funding to finish the ship and <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> dormant British economy. The government offered Cunard a loan of £3 million to complete hull 534 and an additional £5 million to build a second ship, if Cunard merged with White Star.|$|E

5|$|In early 1946, British fan John Carnell {{launched}} a new science fiction magazine titled New Worlds, published by Pendulum Publications. The first issue appeared in July 1946 and failed to sell well. The second issue, in October of that year, sold better, but Pendulum {{went out of business}} before the end of 1947 with only one more issue released. A group of sf fans, including Carnell and Frank Cooper, decided to <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> magazine under their own control, and formed Nova Publications Ltd. The fourth issue appeared in April 1949.|$|E
5|$|In the south, the 3rd Parachute Brigade started {{crossing}} the River Dives on 18August, delayed {{by the need}} to build a crossing to replace the bridge destroyed by the division during Operation Tonga. By nightfall the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was engaging the German rearguard and the 8th Parachute Battalion reached the outskirts of Goustranville. The next morning the brigade advance continued into Goustranville, where they came under heavy artillery fire from the high ground at Putot. Their attack faltered and Gale decided to <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> advance that night. He ordered the 3rd Parachute Brigade to secure the start point along the Dives canal and railway line, while the 5th Parachute Brigade assaulted the artillery position at Putot.|$|E
5|$|Jumpscares {{are present}} {{in all of the}} series' main games, and occur when any animatronic manages to reach and attack the player-{{character}}. Most jumpscares involve an animatronic character suddenly appearing in the player's view, followed by a loud, bellowing sound. Some jumpscares, including those of Golden Freddy, Nightmare, and Nightmarionne, consist of a single screen supplemented with shrill, distorted audio. These jumpscares usually crash or <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> game. The player can utilise the tools listed above to prevent attacks, thus preventing any jumpscares from occurring.|$|E

5|$|Kings was {{recorded}} by the Opies as common in eastern England. The English Dialect Dictionary recorded much {{the same in the}} nineteenth century. The earliest recorded instance the Opies found was in Sternberg's 1851 Dialect of Northamptonshire. Queens is recorded as used in the kings area, sometimes as an alternative and sometimes as indicating readiness to <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> game. Kings truce is found in Thomas Dekker's The Honest Whore, Part One (II,i), which appeared in 1604. The term is used in the play to halt a quarrel.|$|E
5|$|On 18 January, {{a problem}} with the {{computers}} aboard Mir developed shortly before fuelling of the Soyuz-U rocket was scheduled to commence, about five and a half hours before the launch was due to occur. The launch attempt was scrubbed, or cancelled, and the launch was expected to be delayed by four or five days. On 19 January, the launch was rescheduled for 24 January, giving controllers time to <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> computer and the station's gyroscopes, which had shut down when the computer failed.|$|E
5|$|The anti-Hindi activists from Madras State {{were not}} {{satisfied}} with the 1967 Amendment, as it did not address their concerns about the three language formula. However, with DMK in power, they hesitated to <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> agitation. The Tamil Nadu Students' Anti-Hindi imposition Agitation council split into several factions. The moderate factions favored letting Annadurai and the government to deal with the situation. The extremist factions restarted the agitations. They demanded scrapping of the three language formula and an end to teaching of Hindi, abolishing the use of Hindi commands in the National Cadet Corps (NCC), banning of Hindi films and songs and closure of the Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachara Sabha (Institution for Propagation of Hindi in South India).|$|E
