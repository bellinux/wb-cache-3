25|$|Among her {{literary}} role models, Sandemo names William Shakespeare, Fyodor Dostoevsky, J.R.R. Tolkien, Agatha Christie and Kjersti Scheen. She <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> {{of works}} of Shakespeare {{at the age of}} eight years, and wasn't much older when she turned to crime novels. Kalevala, the national epic of the Finnish people, Winnie the Pooh by A. A. Milne and King Lear were her favourites. In the adult age she has read significantly less, fearing subconscious plagiarizing. She says that she has got artistic influences also from the Kalevala motifed paintings of Akseli Gallen-Kallela and goblin motifed paintings of Gerhard Munthe. Other sources of inspiration have been classical music, such as the compositions of Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven as well as old Europeans folk stories. Besides these she is fond of Star Wars films, thriller film The Silence of the Lambs directed by Jonathan Demme and earliest episodes of TV-series The X-Files. To her mind the newest episodes of the series are pure rubbish.|$|E

He reads a random section in which Elmer and his brother Joseph were attacked by Ben. [...] Jake confronts Ben and accuses him of only pretending to be his parents’ friend. Ben becomes angry and tells Jake {{that it was a}} different time, and that he would not understand. Ben reveals that there were a few chickens who became intelligent prior to 1979, and that he met one at the poultry where he worked. Ben recognized that the chicken was aware, but he beat it to death with a brick out of fear. This filled him with guilt, so when all chickens gained awareness he protected the three he could – Elmer, Helen, and Joseph. Ben suggests Jake <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> diary from beginning and offers to add context if he can.|$|E

500|$|Astonishing Stories is not {{remembered as}} {{being among the}} best science fiction magazines: both critic Peter Nicholls and sf writer Jack Williamson have {{described}} it as a [...] "training ground" [...] for writers who would go on to do their best work elsewhere. [...] However, Nicholls adds that [...] "its stories were surprisingly good considering how little was paid for them", and Wolf and Thompson agree, claiming that [...] "there was much that was memorable in Astonishing, both by way of immediate appeal and of more lasting quality". [...] Pohl himself, who later became a very successful magazine editor, felt he made many mistakes. [...] He quotes as an example his serialization of Malcolm Jameson's story [...] "Quicksands of Youthwardness" [...] in three parts; the story was only 27,000 words long, and readers complained (justifiably, in Pohl's view) that serializing it in a bimonthly magazine meant they had to wait for five months to <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> story, in relatively small 9,000-word pieces. [...] Overall, Pohl assessed his performance by saying [...] "I wasn't really a very good editor"; adding [...] "With what I know now I could have made those magazines sing, but as it was they just lay there".|$|E

Documentarian Bruno Monsaingeon said of him, [...] "No supreme pianist has ever given {{of his heart}} and mind so {{overwhelmingly}} while showing himself so sparingly."

Bazzana writes that [...] "it is tempting to assume that Gould was asexual, an image that certainly fits his aesthetic and the persona he sought to convey, and one can <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> Gould literature and be convinced that he died a virgin"—but he also mentions that evidence points to [...] "a number of relationships with women {{that may or may}} not have been platonic and ultimately became complicated and were ended".|$|E

Tremblay said his part was not hard [...] "because I {{was playing a}} happy child" [...] unaware of the sinister nature of Room. However, {{because he was too}} young to <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> screenplay, each scene was explained to him one by one. Tremblay wore a wig made from human hair. According to Joan Allen, Larson and Tremblay met for over three weeks to build a [...] "very tight, obviously critical, close relationship," [...] before the Room scenes were shot over five weeks. Allen arrived in Toronto later and met Tremblay, [...] "But we didn’t want him to become too familiar with me because that’s not what the story is." ...|$|E

[...] Lennon made reference to [...] "Yesterday" [...] in his song [...] "How Do You Sleep?" [...] on his 1971 album Imagine. The song appears to attack McCartney with the line [...] "The only thing you done was yesterday, but since you've gone you're just another day", a reference to McCartney's recent hit [...] "Another Day". At the 2006 Grammy Awards, McCartney performed [...] "Yesterday" [...] live as a mash-up with Linkin Park and Jay Z's [...] "Numb/Encore".|$|E

He remarked that there was no evidence in the report which a court would recognise. Instead it assumed that because uncorroborated allegations had been made, the offences were committed, and, treating allegations as facts, it declared that 214 incidents had now been [...] "formally recorded" [...] as crimes. Moore commented that by doing so the report undermined justice. Jonathan Brown, writing in The Independent, said that the report [...] "revealed a man who used his celebrity status and outwardly well-intended works to gain access to and ultimately rape and sexually exploit hundreds of vulnerable young star-struck victims..." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Foundations sold well: eight editions and 60,000 copies within 10 years, 100,000 copies by the {{outbreak}} of World War I and 24 editions {{and more than a}} quarter of a million copies by 1938. The success of The Foundations after it was published in October 1899 made Chamberlain into a celebrity intellectual. The popularity of The Foundations was such that many Gymnasium (high school) teachers in the Protestant parts of Germany made [...] Die Grundlagen required reading for their students. One teacher remembered: [...] "I myself <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> book in one go when as a young gymnasium teacher in Nürnberg it fell into my hands. And with a flushed face I put it aside full of excitement. I can picture the scene today [...] and can reawaken the old feeling". The book sold very well, but reviews in Germany were very mixed. Conservative and National Liberal newspapers gave generally friendly reviews to The Foundations. Völkisch newspapers gave overwhelming positive reviews to The Foundations with many völkisch reviewers calling Die Grundlagen one of the greatest books ever written. German universities were hotbeds of völkisch activity in the early 20th century, and The Foundations was extremely popular on university campuses with many university clubs using The Foundations as a reason to exclude Jewish students from joining. Likewise, military schools were centers of völkisch thought in the early 20th century, and so The Foundations was very popular with officer cadets; though since neither the Navy nor the Prussian, Bavarian, Saxon and Württemberg armies accepted Jewish officer candidates, Die Grundlagen did not lead to Jews being excluded. The only exceptions to the otherwise total exclusion of German Jews from the officer corps were the Bavarian and Saxon armies, which were prepared to accept Jews as reserve officers. [...] Liberal and Social Democratic newspapers gave the book extremely poor reviews with reviewers complaining of an irrational way of reasoning in The Foundations, noted that Chamberlain quoted out of context the writings of Goethe to give him views that he had not held in The Foundations [...] and that the entire book was full of an obsessive anti-Semitism that they found extremely off-putting.|$|E
