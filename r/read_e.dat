50|$|In 1941, {{shortly after}} the first {{performance}} of his opera Paul Bunyan, Britten and his partner Peter Pears went to stay at Escondido, California. There they read the poem by Crabbe and were struck by it. Britten, being a native of Suffolk, strongly identified with the tragic story of the Aldeburgh fisherman Peter Grimes.This opera was first conceived while Britten was in California. Happening to <b>read</b> <b>E.</b> M. Forster's article on the 18th-century Suffolk poet George Crabbe in the BBC's magazine The Listener, he was straight away filled with nostalgic feelings about Suffolk. Pears found a copy of Crabbe's works in a second-hand bookshop and Britten read the poem The Borough, which contained the tragic story of the Aldeburgh fisherman Peter Grimes. He said later: in a flash I realised two things: that I must write an opera, and where I belonged.Britten returned to England in April 1942. Soon after his return, he asked Montagu Slater to be his librettist for Peter Grimes.Britten and Pears both had a strong hand in drafting the story, and in this process the character of Grimes became far more complex. Rather than being the clear-cut villain he is in Crabbe's version, he became a victim of both cruel fate and society, while retaining darker aspects in his character. It is left to the audience to decide which version is more true, and to see how clear-cut or ambiguous the various characters are.|$|E

In this work we study the cost of counting within weaker types of concurrency, where no cooperation takes place between the concurrent processes, except when time comes to decide whether the input should be accepted. We first study the number of states required for deterministic, nondeterministic, universal, and alternating automata to count to n, namely to accept the unary language f 1 n g. We then study settings in which the task of counting should be accomplished before the whole input is <b>read</b> (<b>e.</b> g., in the language Σ nΓ 1 Δ 0 ΔΣ).

A surprise recognition test for the presented items then revealed a substantial retention advantage for the briefly presented items, but no similar advantage was produced in recall. It is argued that under rapid viewing conditions subjects may fail to extract enough visual features to allow for immediate resolution, requiring the initiation of a kind of data-driven generation process. This latter process then produces a generation effect for the briefly presented items compared with the read items, but only on a retention test that shows sensitivity to data-driven processing. These results are discussed from the standpoint of current theoretical views on the generation effect.

To further our understanding of this visual-verbal association deficit, we investigated the ability of dyslexic readers to bind information in the visual working memory to determine if a generalised binding deficit could account for the visual-verbal deficit. We carried out two experiments, a change-detection and a cue-recall task, on 16 high-functioning dyslexic participants and 16 age- and IQ-matched control participants to access their ability to bind features. We hypothesised that dyslexic participants would perform less well when binding features in their visual working memory, compared to controls. Results demonstrated that dyslexic readers had no difficulty in binding features in their visual working memory and were actually quite good at it. We concluded that a generalised binding deficit did not account for the visual-verbal association deficit seen in developmental dyslexia. We discussed these findings with reference to coping strategies and possible alternative explanations for the deficit...|$|E

Whereas the path integral treatments on the disc and on the strip are new, two further path integral treatments are discussed for the Poincaré upper half-plane to the existing one. All the calculations are mainly based on Fourier-expansions of the Feynman kernels which can be easily performed. The remaining path integrals on D, U and S {{can be reduced to}} the path integral problems on the pseudosphere $Δ^ 2 $, Liouville quantum mechanics and the modified Pöschl-Teller potential problem, respectively, where the results by means of path integrals are known.

Keywords: effectiveness, <b>e</b> <b>reading</b> tool, reading {{comprehension}} achievement, reading instruction One {{of the tools}} used in {{reading comprehension}} instruction is <b>e</b> <b>reading.</b> <b>E</b> <b>reading</b> tool refers {{to a group of}} activity that is organized in applying the hardware and software used to display electronic text on a computer screen or other devices that support its application on learning process. In this research, the researcher try to use electronic pessages or digital reading pessages that may display pictures, character visualization, story setting images, etc. The aim is to give students experience of reading pleasure, then the students seem to emotionally respond to the characters, plot, setting, events, and the writer messages. So, it will help students learn to read comprehensively. The formulation of the research problems were: 1) How is the students’ reading achievement before being taught by using <b>e</b> <b>reading</b> tool? 2) How is the students’ reading achievement after being taught by using <b>e</b> <b>reading</b> tool? 3) Is there any significant difference of students’ achievement before and after being taught by using e readingtool?

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} how organisations can keep their crisis preparedness alert although crises do not occur often. A crisis organisation will lay dormant within a larger organisation for long periods of time. This may cause a problem when a crisis does occur if the preparedness has not been kept alive. From previous researchers that we have studied within this field we have identified two distinct methods to do this. The first focuses on the importance of detailed crisis plans, while the other method suggests that it is more essential to develop specific competencies with the employees. We also find that keeping knowledge within an organisation is a matter of organisational learning and memory which we therefore discuss and analyse. We have performed an interview study at E.

A systematic literature review was conducted, which means we followed Goodman’s six steps out of seven.

40|$|In a hydro-dominated system, such as New Zealand, {{the continual}} {{improvement}} {{and development of}} effective optimization and simulation software to inform decision making is necessary for effective resource management. Stochastic Constructive Dual Dynamic Programming (SCDDP) is a technique which has been effectively applied to the New Zealand system for optimization and simulation. This variant of Dynamic Programming (DP) allows optimization {{to occur in the}} dual space reducing the computational complexity and allows solutions from a single run to be formed as price signal surfaces and trajectories. However, any application of this method suffers from issues with computational tractability for higher reservoir numbers. Furthermore, New Zealand specific applications currently provide limited information on the system as they all use the same two-reservoir approximation of the New Zealand system. This limitation is of increasing importance with the decentralization of the New Zealand electricity sector. In this thesis we develop this theory with respect to two key goals: • To advance the theory surrounding SCDDP to be generalizable to higher reservoir numbers through the application of the point-wise algorithm explored in R.
