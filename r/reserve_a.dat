5|$|A herd {{lives on}} the Rachel Carson {{component}} of the North Carolina National Estuarine Research <b>Reserve,</b> <b>a</b> series of five small islands and several salt marshes. There were no horses at the Sanctuary until the 1940s. It is unclear whether the Bankers swam over from nearby Shackleford or were left by residents who had used the islands to graze livestock. They are owned and managed {{by the state of}} North Carolina and regarded as a cultural resource.|$|E
5|$|By 30 November, the 6th Brigade was {{surrounded}} and the Afrika Korps, including the Italian Ariete Division, began attacking after midday with tanks and infantry. Despite {{the support of}} anti-tank guns, the New Zealanders were overrun. Shuttleworth was made a prisoner-of-war along with his surviving company commanders. The survivors of the 25th Battalion, now commanded by Major Henry Burton, the sole surviving company commander, had been moved into <b>reserve</b> <b>a</b> few days previously and managed to withdraw before Sidi Rezegh was overrun.|$|E

5|$|Aintree-Eglinton <b>Reserve,</b> <b>a</b> {{grassed area}} {{covering}} , contains a cricket pitch, several practice runs and night lights for Australian rules football, which are utilised by local amateur and junior clubs. Within the reserve is the Hamersley Community Recreation Centre, first {{built in the}} 1970s as a community hall and opened {{in its present form}} on 22 April 1990. The centre is a small village area consisting of a central pergola crossed with walking paths, flanked by four buildings: a sports hall with basketball courts and kiosk, an arts and crafts building, a community hall and function building hosting discos and other social events, and a purpose-built children's centre. Near the centre are the 1st Hamersley Scout Group, a child health centre and the Holy Cross Anglican Church, a colonial-style building built in 1974 and consecrated on 14 December 1980 to serve the newly formed Balcatta-Hamersley Parish.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Grierson, {{commander}} of the 10th Cavalry, traversed the hot Chihuahuan Desert and then the narrow valleys of the Chinati Mountains, reaching Rattlesnake Springs {{on the morning of}} August 6, 1880. His cavalrymen and their mounts were worn down from the forced march of over 65miles in 21 hours. After resting and getting water, Grierson carefully placed his men in ambush positions. Carpenter, with his two cavalry troops, arrived as reinforcements and were posted in <b>reserve</b> <b>a</b> short distance south of the spring. The cavalrymen settled down to wait as Indian scouts brushed away any sign of their presence.|$|E
5|$|Eleven Ottoman {{infantry}} divisions {{had been}} forced to retire, suffering 28,443 casualties; some 12,000 prisoners were captured, 100 guns, and scores of machine guns were also captured. Now the Ottoman Army needed to deploy troops from other theatres to make up for these significant losses. On 15 December the Ottoman 2nd Caucasian Cavalry Division arrived in Palestine and became the reserve of the XXII Corps before taking part in the counterattacks of 27 December. The 1st Infantry Division arrived from the Caucasus and moved to Nablus in <b>reserve.</b> <b>A</b> significant consequence of the Ottoman Empire's firm focus on the Levant was that the British recapture of Baghdad and the British offensive in Mesopotamia became more viable and secure.|$|E

5|$|In 1943, Miller {{was cast}} as Mr. Krohn in Lance Comfort's World War II spy drama Squadron Leader X {{alongside}} Beatrice Varley and Ann Dvorak, {{his first major}} film role. Soon afterwards, he played Doctor Novotny in Harold S. Bucquet's spy film The Adventures of Tartu, {{the first of many}} roles as a doctor. Comfort hired him again the following year to appear alongside James Mason, Lucie Mannheim and Raymond Lovell in Hotel <b>Reserve,</b> <b>a</b> spy film set in a hotel in southern France just before World War II. He then had a small role as Schmidt in Harold French's romantic comedy English Without Tears (1944) alongside Michael Wilding, Margaret Rutherford and Penelope Dudley-Ward.|$|E

Many regular visitors of Harlem's night clubs also found the food better at Smalls Paradise than at either The Cotton Club or Connie's Inn. While most of the night spots shut their doors between 3 and 4 am, Smalls Paradise began breakfast dances at 6 am with a floor show of up to 30 dancers and a full jazz band.|$|E
5|$|São Tomé and Príncipe {{qualified}} one {{boat in the}} men's C-1 1000 metres for the Olympics at the 2016 African Championships, signifying the nation's {{return to}} the sport after an eight-year hiatus.

5|$|The area {{including}} present-day Youngstown {{was part}} of the Connecticut Western <b>Reserve,</b> <b>a</b> section of the Northwest Territory that Connecticut initially did not cede to the Federal government. Upon cession, Connecticut retained the title to the land in the Western Reserve, which it sold to the Connecticut Land Company for $1,200,000. While many of the area's early settlers came from Connecticut, Youngstown attracted a significant number of Scots-Irish settlers from neighboring Pennsylvania. The first European Americans to settle permanently in the area were Pittsburgh native James Hillman and wife Catherine Dougherty. By 1798, Youngstown was the home of several families who were concentrated near the point where Mill Creek meets the Mahoning River. Boardman Township was founded in 1798 by Elijah Boardman, a member of the Connecticut Land Company. Also founded in 1798 was Austintown by John McCollum who was a settler from New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|The first {{company of}} the 7th Parachute Battalion, {{commanded}} by Major Nigel Taylor, arrived at the bridges. Howard directed them to defensive positions west of the canal in Bénouville and Le Port. When Pine-Coffin arrived at the bridges, he was briefed by Howard, and crossed into Bénouville and set up his headquarters beside the church. Pine-Coffin had about 200 men in his three companies. He positioned 'A' and 'C' Companies in Bénouville facing south towards Caen and 'B' Company in Le Port facing Ouistreham. 'D' Company was now pulled back into the area between the two bridges and held in <b>reserve.</b> <b>A</b> further sweep of the trenches and bunkers was conducted, and resulted in the capture {{of a number of}} Germans.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the gold rush on the Native peoples of the region was considerable. The Tlingit and the Koyukon peoples prospered {{in the short term}} from their work as guides, packers and from selling food and {{supplies}} to the prospectors. In the longer term, however, especially the Hän people living in the Klondike region suffered from the environmental damage of the gold mining on the rivers and forests. Their population had already begun to decline after the discovery of gold along Fortymile River in the 1880s but dropped catastrophically after their move to the <b>reserve,</b> <b>a</b> result of the contaminated water supply and smallpox. The Hän found only few ways to benefit economically from the gold rush and their fishing and hunting grounds were largely destroyed; by 1904 they needed aid from the NWMP to prevent famine.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} Air Force, Barr {{remained}} in Mildura with his wife, Dorothy (Dot). They had {{met on a}} blind date in 1938 and been married only a few weeks when Nicky joined the RAAF. During the war she was told on three occasions that her husband was dead. The couple had two sons, born in 1945 and 1947. Barr's injuries prevented him from returning to a rugby career, and he took up yachting as a sport. He also briefly assisted fellow No.3 Squadron veteran Bobby Gibbes in an airline venture in New Guinea, before going into business as a company manager and director with civil engineering and pharmaceutical firms. Barr rejoined the RAAF on 20March 1951 as a pilot in the active Citizen Air Force (CAF), with the acting rank of wing commander. On 15April 1953, he transferred to the CAF <b>reserve.</b> <b>A</b> member of the Royal Air Forces Escaping Society, Barr began travelling to Italy with his wife on a regular basis in the late 1950s to seek out and offer assistance to those who had helped him during his wartime escape attempts.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, the Alaska Legislature {{created the}} Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation {{to manage the}} {{investments}} of the Permanent Fund, and it passed the Permanent Fund Dividend program, which provided for annual payments to Alaskans from the interest earned by the fund. After two years of legal arguments about who should be eligible for payments, the first checks were distributed to Alaskans. After peaking at more than $40 billion in 2007, the fund's value declined to approximately $26 billion as of summer 2009. In addition to the Permanent Fund, the state also maintains the Constitutional Budget <b>Reserve,</b> <b>a</b> separate savings account established in 1990 after a legal dispute over pipeline tariffs generated a one-time payment of more than $1.5 billion from the oil companies. The Constitutional Budget reserve is run similar to the Permanent Fund, but money from it can be withdrawn {{to pay for the}} state's annual budget, unlike the Permanent Fund.|$|E
5|$|Many of Gibraltar's fortifications {{were already}} {{redundant}} {{well before the}} British garrison was withdrawn from the territory in the 1990s, and the rapid military rundown in the 1980s and the 1990s left the civilian authorities with {{a large amount of}} surplus military property. Many of the best-preserved fortifications are in the Upper Rock Nature <b>Reserve,</b> <b>a</b> conservation area that covers about 40% of the area of Gibraltar. A few of the Upper Rock batteries have been preserved intact; all three of the 5.25-inch guns at Princess Anne's Battery are still in place, making it {{the only place in the}} world where a complete 5.25-inch battery can still be seen. The 9.2 inch guns at Breakneck, Lord Airey's and O'Hara's Batteries are still in situ and can now be visited. Elsewhere, most of the ordnance has been removed. Two surviving 6-inch guns remain at Devil's Gap Battery, one of which is the gun that engaged a German U-boat in August 1917. At Napier of Magdala Battery one of the two 100-ton RML 17.72 inch guns is still in situ and has been restored, along with a 3.7 inch quick-firing anti-aircraft gun. The site is now run by the Gibraltar Tourist Board in conjunction with the Nature Reserve.|$|E
5|$|The Americans, British, and French all {{differed}} on {{the issue}} of reparations settlement. The Western Front had been fought in France, and that countryside had been heavily scarred in the fighting. France's most industrialized region in the north-east had been laid to waste during the German retreat. Hundreds of mines and factories were destroyed along with railroads, bridges and villages. Georges Clemenceau, the Prime Minister of France, thought it appropriate that any just peace required Germany to pay reparations for the damage they had caused. He also saw reparations as a means to ensure that Germany could not again threaten France and as well to weaken the German ability to compete with France's industrialization. Reparations would also go towards the reconstruction costs in other countries, such as Belgium, also directly affected by the war. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George opposed harsh reparations in favour of a less crippling reparations settlement so that the German economy could remain a viable economic power and British trading partner. He furthermore argued that reparations should include war pensions for disabled veterans and allowances to be paid to war widows, which would, <b>reserve</b> <b>a</b> larger share of the reparations for the British Empire. Wilson opposed these positions, and was adamant that there be no indemnity imposed upon Germany.|$|E
