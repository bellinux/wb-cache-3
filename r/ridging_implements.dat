40|$|Large-scale donation-based {{distributed}} infrastructures need to {{cope with}} the inherent unreliability of participant nodes. A widely-used work scheduling technique in such environments is to redundantly schedule the outsourced computations to a number of nodes. We present the design and implementation of RIDGE, a reliability-aware system which uses a node’s prior performance and behavior to make more effective scheduling decisions. We have <b>implemented</b> <b>RIDGE</b> on top of the BOINC distributed computing infrastructure and have evaluated its performance on a live PlanetLab testbed. Our experimental results show that RIDGE is able to match or surpass the throughput of the best BOINC configuration by automatically adapting to the characteristics of the underlying environment. In addition, RIDGE is able to provide much lower workunit makespans compared to BOINC. RIDGE is also able to produce significantly lower communication makespans for downloading clients. Collectively, the results suggest that RIDGE has great promise for service-oriented environments with time constraints. ...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePorous silicon (PSi) is {{material}} which {{physical and}} optical properties {{have been widely}} studied for biological sensors. Indeed, the wide internal surface of PSi, {{as well as its}} biocompatibility have significant advantages for use in the fields of sensors. Moreover, integrated micro-resonators (MRs), by their geometry and operating principle, allow to fabricate very sensitive and miniaturized sensors. The PSi MR is destined to be used as an optical transducer for domains using the sensing and analysis of specific molecules such as health, food industries and security. The porous nature of the ridge waveguide allows the target molecules to be infiltrated in the guiding layer and being detected by direct interaction with the propagated light. This volume detection will significantly enhance the sensor sensitivity and will allow a lowest limit of detection compared to those obtained by using usual MRs based on evanescent wave detection. Integrated racetrack MR made from partially oxidized PSi <b>ridge</b> waveguides are <b>implemented</b> using an electrochemical etching method of silicon substrate, followed by a thermal oxidation and then by a standard photolithography process.

Census Bureau and the National Resources Inventory predicts that the developed area in the United States will increase by 54. 4 million acres during the next 25 years (McMahon 2010, 2). America’s rural landscape and character is replaced everyday by “placeless” neighborhoods with limited emphasis on conservation efforts. The intent of this report is to demonstrate the benefits of applying conservation design principles {{to the development of}} a conservation subdivision in rural Kansas. A 132 acre tract of land, currently known as Nelson’s Ridge, is planned and designed for a subdivision development. The property is located just east of Manhattan, Kansas. The site includes a tributary drainage corridor surrounded by woodlands, existing agriculture fields and upland prairie. It is located no more than a mile from existing amenities of a growing residential and commercial corridor along Highway 24 in Pottawatomie County. The preliminary plat designed by local engineering firm Schwab-Eaton, demonstrates America’s typical or “conventional” approach to subdivision design (Arendt, 1996). The alternative approach is known as a low-impact development or “conservation development” (Gause 2007). After completing a thorough site inventory and analysis, two preliminary designs eventually led to a final conceptual master plan. The two preliminary designs included contemporary and neo-traditional schemes, each portraying conservation principles in alternative ways. Fully understanding the two design alternatives allowed for a balanced and more cohesive final design that incorporated the most positive aspects of both conservation approaches. The preliminary plat and the conservation design were then compared and analyzed in terms of demonstrated design principles and their economic feasibility. This project provides an example for rural subdivision development in Pottawatomie County, Kansas. The project provides decision makers with a conceptual master plan for Nelson’s <b>Ridge</b> that <b>implements</b> conservation subdivision design principles. This project will educate developers, homeowners and the public about design alternatives for subdivision development. The comprehensive analysis of the proposed design will provide important insight into the benefits and limitations of implementing conservation principles into a development...|$|R
40|$|The diploma thesis {{presents}} an upgrade of the FingerIdent fingerprint verification system. The {{current version of}} the system uses a minutia matching procedure for comparison of two fingerprints. In order to improve {{the security of the}} system we have implemented an additional matching procedure which is based on the use of fingerprint ridges. Algorithm inputs are lists of ridge points of two fingerprints. At the beginning the algorithm searches the initial base ridge pair and matches it. Then it calculates the overlapping region of the fingerprints and recursively matches all the other pairs of ridges. In order to tolerate non-linear distortion it calculates the transformation for each matching pair separately. It repeats the procedure for the other base ridge pairs and uses the best matching score. We have carried out the integration of the algorithm with the FingerIdent system {{in a way that the}} final matching score of two fingerprints is formed as a combination of the existent matching procedure and the newly implemented matching procedure. We have tested the upgraded FingerIdent system on four test sets from the FVC 2002 competition. Each test set contains 800 fingerprint images of different qualities and sizes. We have tested different matching scenarios. Comparison of the results shows that the system which calculates the final matching score as a weighted sum of scores of the current minutia matching procedure and the newly <b>implemented</b> <b>ridge</b> matching procedure achieves better reliability. ...|$|R
40|$|To assist {{technology}} advancements, it {{is important}} to continue the search for new materials. The stability of a crystal structures is closely connected to its formation energy. By calculating the formation energies of theoretical crystal structures it is possible to find new stable materials. However, the number of possible structures are so many that traditional methods relying on quantum mechanics, such as Density Functional Theory (DFT), require too much computational time to be viable in such a project. A presented alternative to such calculations is machine learning. Machine learning is an umbrella term for algorithms that can use information gained from one set of data to predict properties of new, similar data. Feature vector representations (descriptors) are used to present data in an appropriate manner to the machine. Thus far, no combination of machine learning method and feature vector representation has been established as general and accurate enough to be of practical use for accelerating the phase diagram calculations necessary for predicting material stability. It is important that the method predicts all types of structures equally well, regardless of stability, composition, or geometrical structure. In this thesis, the performances of different feature vector representations were compared to each other. The machine learning method used was primarily Kernel <b>Ridge</b> Regression, <b>implemented</b> in Python. The training and validation were performed on two different datasets and subsets of these. The representation which consistently yielded the lowest cross-validated error was a representation using the Voronoi tessellation of the structure by Ward et. al. [Phys. Rev. B 96, 024104 (2017) ]. Following up was an experimental representation called the SLATM representation presented by Huang and von Lilienfeld [arXiv: 1707. 04146], which is partially based on the Radial Distribution Function. The Voronoi representation achieved an MAE of 0. 16 eV/atom at 3534 training set size for one of the sets, and 0. 28 eV/atom at 10086 training set size for the other set. The effect of separating linear and non-linear energy contributions was evaluated using the sinusoidal and Coulomb representations. The result was that separating these improved the error for small training set sizes, but the effect diminishes as the training set size increases. The results from this thesis implicate that further work is still required for machine learning to be used effectively in the search for new materials...|$|R
40|$|Hybrid {{breeding}} in barley (L.) offers great {{opportunities to}} accelerate the rate of genetic improvement and to boost yield stability. A crucial requirement consists of the efficient selection of superior hybrid combinations. We used comprehensive phenotypic and genomic data from a commercial breeding program {{with the goal of}} examining the potential to predict the hybrid performances. The phenotypic data were comprised of replicated grain yield trials for 385 two-way and 408 three-way hybrids evaluated in up to 47 environments. The parental lines were genotyped using a 3 k single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array based on an Illumina Infinium assay. We <b>implemented</b> <b>ridge</b> regression best linear unbiased prediction modeling for additive and dominance effects and evaluated the prediction ability using five-fold cross validations. The prediction ability of hybrid performances based on general combining ability (GCA) effects was moderate, amounting to 0. 56 and 0. 48 for two- and three-way hybrids, respectively. The potential of GCA-based hybrid prediction requires that both parental components have been evaluated in a hybrid background. This is not necessary for genomic prediction for which we also observed moderate cross-validated prediction abilities of 0. 51 and 0. 58 for two- and three-way hybrids, respectively. This exemplifies the potential of genomic prediction in hybrid barley. Interestingly, prediction ability using the two-way hybrids as training population and the three-way hybrids as test population or vice versa was low, presumably, because of the different genetic makeup of the parental source populations. Consequently, {{further research is needed to}} optimize genomic prediction approaches combining different source populations in barley...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an efficient}} parallel {{implementation of a}} Kernel Ridge Regression solver, based on the Gaussian Belief Propagation algorithm (GaBP). Our approach can be easily used in Peer-to-Peer and grid environments, {{where there is no}} central authority that allocates work. Empirically, our solver has high accuracy in solving classification problems. We have tested our distributed implementation on large scale datasets using up to 1, 024 CPUs of an IBM Blue Gene supercomputer. 1. KERNEL RIDGE REGRESSION Kernel <b>Ridge</b> Regression (KRR) <b>implements</b> a regularized form of the least squares method useful for both regression and classification. The non-linear version of KRR is similar to the Support-Vector Machine (SVM) problem. However, in the latter, special emphasis is given to points close to the decision boundary, which is not provided by the cost function used by KRR. Given training data D = {xi, yi} l i= 1, xi ∈ R d, yi ∈ R the KRR algorithm determines the parameter vector w ∈ R d of a non-linear model (using the “kernel trick”), via minimization of the following objective function: [2]: min λ||w| | 2 + l� i= 1 (yi − w T Φ(xi)) 2 where λ is a tradeoff parameter between the two terms of the optimization function, and Φ (˙) is a (possible non-linear) mapping of the training patterns. One can show that the dual form of this optimization problem is given by: max W(α) = y T a + 1 / 4 λα T Kα − 1 / 4 α T α (1) where K is a matrix whose (i, j) -th entry is the kernel function Ki,j = Φ(xi) T Φ(xj).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to use molecular dynamics simulation (MD) to evaluate the vesicularity and noble gas fractionation, and to shed light on bubble formation during MORB degassing. A previous simulation study (Guillot and Sator (2011) GCA 75, 1829 - 1857) has shown that the solubility of CO 2 in basaltic melts increases steadily with the pressure and deviates significantly from Henry's law at high pressures (e. g. 9. 5 wt% CO 2 at 50 kbar as compared with 2. 5 wt% from Henry's law). From the CO 2 solubility curve and the equations of state of the two coexisting phases (silicate melt and supercritical CO 2), deduced from the MD simulation, we have evaluated the evolution of the vesicularity of a MORB melt at depth as function of its initial CO 2 contents. An excellent agreement is obtained between calculations and data on MORB samples collected at oceanic <b>ridges.</b> Moreover, by <b>implementing</b> the test particle method (Guillot and Sator (2012) GCA 80, 51 - 69), the solubility of noble gases in the two coexisting phases (supercritical CO 2 and CO 2 -saturated melt), the partitioning and the fractionation of noble gases between melt and vesicles have been evaluated as function of the pressure. We show that the melt/CO 2 partition coefficients of noble gases increase significantly with the pressure whereas the large distribution of the 4 He/ 40 Ar* ratio reported in the literature is explained if the magma experiences a suite of vesiculation and vesicle loss during ascent. By applying a pressure drop to a volatile bearing melt, the MD simulation reveals the main steps of bubble formation and noble gas transfer at the nanometric scale. A key result is that the transfer of noble gases is found to be driven by CO 2 bubble nucleation, a finding which suggests that the diffusivity difference between He and Ar in the degassing melt has virtually no effect on the 4 He/ 40 Ar* ratio measured in the vesicles.
