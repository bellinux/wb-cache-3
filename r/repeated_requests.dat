5|$|A {{few months}} later, in June 1919, the American Federation of Labor (AFL), {{responding}} to <b>repeated</b> <b>requests</b> from local police organizations, began accepting police organizations into their membership.

5|$|Author Walter Noble Burns visited Earp in September 1926 {{and asked}} him {{questions}} {{with the intent to}} write a book about Earp. Earp declined because he was already collaborating with John Flood. Burns visited Tombstone and based on what he learned decided instead to focus his book on Doc Holliday. He pestered Earp for facts, and on March 27 the next year, Earp finally responded to Burns' <b>repeated</b> <b>requests</b> in an 11-page letter outlining the basic facts from Earp's point of view.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to England Bellingham spent six months in London, seeking {{compensation}} for the imprisonment and financial losses he had suffered in Russia. He considered the British authorities were responsible, through their neglect of his <b>repeated</b> <b>requests</b> for help. Successively he petitioned the Foreign Office, the Treasury, the Privy Council, and Perceval himself; in each case his claims were politely rejected. Defeated and exhausted, in May 1811 Bellingham accepted his wife's ultimatum to abandon his campaign or otherwise lose her and his family. He joined her in Liverpool to begin life afresh.|$|E
40|$|The hybrid {{automatic}} <b>repeat</b> <b>request</b> technique (HARQ) {{represents the}} error control principle which combines an {{error correcting code}} and automatic <b>repeat</b> <b>request</b> procedure (ARQ), within the same transmission system.

5|$|The ground has {{attracted}} criticism from local residents. A parish council meeting in October 2001 revealed that Arsenal players {{had not been}} involved with local initiatives, despite claims during its planning phase that the ground would allow the club to develop links with the local community. Shenley Primary School reportedly failed to receive any visits from players despite <b>repeated</b> <b>requests.</b> The club responded by pointing to initiatives by its Ladies team to organise competitions at local grounds. Plans to develop new buildings and road links to the site were challenged by residents four years later; they believed {{it would lead to}} increased traffic and noise pollution in the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{parents and}} {{families}} of Indigenous children resisted the residential school system throughout its existence. Children were kept from schools and, in some cases, hidden from government officials tasked with rounding up children on reserves. Parents regularly advocated for increased funding for schools, including {{the increase of}} centrally located day schools to improve access to their children, and made <b>repeated</b> <b>requests</b> for improvements {{to the quality of}} education, food, and clothing being provided at the schools. Demands for answers in regards to claims of abuse were often dismissed as a ploy by parents seeking to keep their children at home, with government and school officials positioned as those who knew best.|$|E

30|$|Protection {{techniques}} are usually divided in two large families: automatic <b>repeat</b> <b>request</b> (ARQ) schemes and FEC schemes. Whereas ARQ {{techniques are}} based on the retransmission of lost information, which is requested by the receiver, FEC techniques consist in generating redundancy data that is sent jointly with media data and can be used to recover lost information at the receiver [7]. Combination of both FEC codes and ARQ techniques has also been proposed as in the hybrid automatic <b>repeat</b> <b>request</b> (HARQ) [8].|$|R
5|$|Under the {{guidance}} of General Hermann Balck, the cities of Zhytomyr and Korosten were retaken in mid-November, but after receiving reinforcements Vatutin resumed the offensive on 24 December 1943, and the Red Army continued its successful advance.

5|$|Even as Texian {{governmental}} authority declined, rumors flew that Santa Anna would personally lead {{an invasion}} of Texas to quell the rebellion. Despite this news, Texian army strength continued to dwindle. Texas settlers were divided on whether they were fighting for independence or {{a return to a}} federalist government in Mexico. The confusion caused many settlers to remain at home or to return home. Fewer than 100Texian soldiers remained garrisoned at the Alamo Mission in San Antonio de Béxar (now San Antonio, Texas). Their commander, James C. Neill, feared that his small force would be unable to withstand an assault by the Mexican troops. In response to Neill's <b>repeated</b> <b>requests</b> for reinforcements, Governor Smith assigned Travis and 30 men to the Alamo; they arrived on February 3. Most of the Texians, including Travis, believed that any Mexican invasion was months away.|$|E
5|$|From mid-1944, the USNavy {{pressed for}} B-29s {{to be used}} to lay naval mines in Japan's home waters to {{strengthen}} the blockade of the country. Arnold and his staff were unenthusiastic about these proposals, however, as they believed that such missions would divert too many Superfortresses away from precision bombing attacks. In response to <b>repeated</b> <b>requests</b> from the Navy, Arnold decided in November 1944 to begin mine-laying operations once sufficient aircraft were available. In January 1945, LeMay selected the 313th Bombardment Wing to be the Twentieth Air Force's specialist mine-laying unit, and the Navy provided assistance with its training and logistics. LeMay designated the aerial mining campaign Operation Starvation. As the United States had only occasionally used mines up to this time, the Japanese military had placed relatively little emphasis on keeping its minesweeping force up to date. As a result, the IJN was unprepared for the large-scale USAAF offensive.|$|E

This audit set out to establish the size of this problem and to identify the circumstances under which these <b>repeat</b> <b>requests</b> were made in a government tertiary hospital immunology laboratory. The numbers of tests for immunoglobulin measurement, common autoantibodies, and tumour markers that were repeated over a 12 month period were analysed by interrogating the Delphic laboratory computer system using a management information system for raw data enquiry protocol. <b>Repeat</b> <b>requests</b> within 12 weeks of a previous request made up 16. 78 % of the total workload. The total cost of the tests was estimated at US$ 132 151. The waste of technician time and reagents as a result of unnecessary repeat testing is excessive.

Magdalena herself is about to turn fifteen but her parents cannot afford to host a quinceañera as lavish as Eileen's, and they deny her <b>repeated</b> <b>requests</b> to hire a Hummer limousine for the occasion. While preparing for her quinceañera, Magdalena learns that she is pregnant by her friend Herman although they had only once engaged in non-penetrative intercourse. Her Christian father is furious, believing that Magdalena has had premarital sex despite her protestations that she is still a virgin.

5|$|The newly {{installed}} French {{colonial government}} promptly exiled Rainilaiarivony to Algiers. Ranavalona and her court were initially permitted {{to remain as}} symbolic figureheads, but the outbreak of a popular resistance movement– the menalamba rebellion– and discovery of anti-French political intrigues at court led the French to exile the queen to the island of Réunion in 1897. Rainilaiarivony died that same year and shortly thereafter Ranavalona was relocated to a villa in Algiers, along with several members of her family. The queen, her family and the servants accompanying her were provided an allowance and enjoyed a comfortable standard of living including occasional trips to Paris for shopping and sightseeing. Despite Ranavalona's <b>repeated</b> <b>requests,</b> she was never permitted to return home to Madagascar. She died of an embolism at her villa in Algiers in 1917 {{at the age of}} 55.

In this paper, we {{introduce a}} new ARQ feedback scheme called Cross-Layer ARQ (CL-ARQ), where ARQ closely interoperates with HARQ by making use of the acknowledgement of HARQ internally. By doing so, CL-ARQ not only removes the overhead for ARQ acknowledgement messages, but also improves the average delivery delay and TCP throughput. Especially, when the entities in charge of HARQ and ARQ are located far apart geographically, CL-ARQ remarkably outperforms the legacy scheme.
