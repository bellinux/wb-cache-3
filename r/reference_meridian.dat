50|$|Global Positioning System (GPS) {{receivers}} {{show that}} the marking strip for the prime meridian at Greenwich is not exactly at zero degrees, zero minutes, and zero seconds but at approximately 5.3 seconds of arc {{to the west of}} the meridian (meaning that the meridian appears to be 102 metres east of this line). In the past, this offset has been attributed to the establishment of <b>reference</b> <b>meridians</b> for space-based location systems such as WGS 84 (which GPS relies on) or that errors gradually crept into the International Time Bureau timekeeping process. The actual reason for the discrepancy is that the marking strip is indeed at astronomical longitude zero degrees, zero minutes, and zero seconds—but GPS receivers show geodetic longitude (specifically ITRF/WGS 84).|$|R
50|$|Cartographers like Mercator, Hondius and Blaeu {{played a}} {{significant}} role in the development of cartography around the turn of the seventeenth century. They were also among the first (in Europe) to deviate from the use of the Ferro meridian, which was based on the works of the Greek astronomer and geographer Ptolemy (c. AD 90 - c. 168). Mercator used prime meridians through Fuerteventura, the Azores and Boa Vista. Other mapmakers put their <b>reference</b> <b>meridians</b> through different places in the Canaries, the Azores, or the Cape Verde. Near the end of his career Mercator came under the influence of the idea that there could be a nature-given reference line where no difference would be observed between geographic and magnetic poles. His lead was followed by cartographers like Abraham Ortelius and Jodocus Hondius. Both inconclusive observations and new scientific theory, in particular that of Henry Gellibrand, put an end to this theory in the first half of the seventeenth century.|$|R
2500|$|Therefore, the {{seemingly}} small drift of the moladot is already significant enough {{to affect the}} date of Rosh Hashanah, which then cascades to many other dates in the calendar year and sometimes, due to the Rosh Hashanah postponement rules, also interacts with the dates of the prior or next year. The molad drift could be corrected by using a progressively shorter molad interval that corresponds to the actual mean lunar conjunction interval at the original molad <b>reference</b> <b>meridian.</b> Furthermore, the molad interval determines the calendar mean year, so using a progressively shorter molad interval would help correct the excessive length of the Hebrew calendar mean year, as well as helping it to [...] "hold onto" [...] the northward equinox for the maximum duration.|$|E

50|$|Although it {{is widely}} assumed that the molad <b>reference</b> <b>meridian</b> of {{longitude}} is that of Jerusalem, Israel, the furthest west molad <b>reference</b> <b>meridian</b> was {{in the era of}} the Maccabees (same era as Hipparchus), when it was midway between the Nile river {{and the end of the}} Euphrates river (the full range of travels of Abraham, forefather of the Jews, and the territory that haShem initially promised Abraham would be inherited by his descendents). Since then, the increasingly excessive length of the molad interval caused its apparent <b>reference</b> <b>meridian</b> to drift progressively eastward at an accelerating rate — in the present era it is at a longitude near Qandahar, Afghanistan, in the sense that today near that meridian a mean solar time clock matches the traditional molad at that moment, provided that the start of each date is taken as local mean sunset.|$|E

40|$|Background: Body {{temperature}} {{is an important}} indicator of health and illness. However, a single temperature measurement is not always reliable. Such measurements can be made using meridians, which are energy channels with acupoints being the nodes. To date, there is no published <b>reference</b> of <b>meridian</b> acupoint temperatures applicable to human health, {{and there is no}} clear digitalized indicator that could be utilized to evaluate human health by way of meridian acupoints up to now. Methods: Our study recruited 100 healthy medical college students for the measurement of acupoint temperature. The temperatures of 135 acupoints of 14 main meridians were measured using infrared thermometers in order to provide a comprehensive body temperature reading of each study participant. Results: The degree of the acupoint temperature consistently ranged from 34. 88 °C to 36. 14 °C. The gross thermograph was concentric, with high degree readings around the heart and low degree readings originating from the feet. The left and right body sides had significant correlation between the degrees of bilateral same name acupoint temperatures of 12 regular meridians (correlation coefficient, 0. 367 – 0. 985; p < 0. 0001). There was also a significant correlation between the acupoint temperature for the governor vessel and the conception vessel (correlation coefficient, 0. 083; p = 0. 006). Conclusion: These findings indicate that meridian acupoint {{temperature is}} characterized by a consistently narrow range, as well as concentricity and symmetry in body temperature degree readings in college students. Meridian acupoint temperature may be a sensitive and valuable indicator to assist in the accurate evaluation of meridian and general human health, and the significance and changes of acupoint temperature in clinical conditions warrants future exploration...|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{movement}} of Earth's tectonic plates, the line of 0° longitude along {{the surface of the}} Earth has slowly moved toward the west from this shifted position by a few centimetres; that is, towards the Airy Transit Circle (or the Airy Transit Circle has moved toward the east, depending on your point of view) since 1984 (or the 1960s). With the introduction of satellite technology, it became possible to create a more accurate and detailed global map. With these advances there also arose the necessity to define a <b>reference</b> <b>meridian</b> that, whilst being derived from the Airy Transit Circle, would also take into account the effects of plate movement and variations {{in the way that the}} Earth was spinning.As a result, the International <b>Reference</b> <b>Meridian</b> was established and is commonly used to denote Earth's prime meridian (0° longitude) by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service, which defines and maintains the link between longitude and time.
