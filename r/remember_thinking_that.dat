2500|$|One of {{the issues}} was the album's {{complexity}} and how the touring Beach Boys {{would be able to}} perform its music live. Wilson said that the band [...] "didn't like the idea of growing musically... They wanted to keep making car songs and I said 'No, we've gotta grow, guys'." [...] On another occasion, he recalled: [...] "They liked [...] but they said it was too arty. I said, 'No, it is not!" [...] Marilyn said: [...] "When Brian was writing Pet Sounds, it was difficult for the guys to understand what he was going through emotionally and what he wanted to create.... they didn't feel what he was going through and what direction he was trying to go in." [...] Tony Asher remembered: [...] "All those guys in the band, certainly Al, Dennis, and Mike, were constantly saying, 'What the fuck do these words mean?' or 'This isn't our kind of shit!' Brian had comebacks, though. He'd say, 'Oh, you guys can't hack this.'...But I <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> those were tense sessions." ...|$|E

5000|$|Though urban {{legends of}} a similar adulterous {{situation}} circulated at the time, LaBute has said he was actually inspired to write the play when, after the events of September 11, his flight from Chicago to New York City was cancelled {{and he had to}} take a 21-hour train ride.

6000|$|As I {{entered the}} hall I saw {{her at the}} far end of it talking to Mr. Allen. This I thought strange, for I knew she disliked him.

In a 1975 interview with Rolling Stone, John Lennon recalled, [...] "I remember hearing Elton John's 'Your Song', heard it in America—it was one of Elton's first big hits—and <b>remember</b> <b>thinking,</b> 'Great, <b>that's</b> the first new thing that's happened since we (The Beatles) happened.' It was a step forward. There was something about his vocal that was an improvement on all of the English vocals until then. I was pleased with it." [...] John Mendelsohn from Rolling Stone called the song a [...] "pretty McCartney-esque ballad".|$|R

2500|$|As {{early as}} 1962, aged 11, Bolland <b>remembers</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> [...] "Carmine Infantino's {{work on the}} Flash and Gil Kane's on Green Lantern and the Atom had a sophistication about it that I hadn't [...] seen." [...] He would later cite Kane and Alex Toth as [...] "pinnacle of excellence," [...] {{alongside}} [...] "Curt Swan, Murphy Anderson, Sid Greene, Joe Kubert, Ross Andru, Mike Esposito, Nick Cardy and the under-rated Bruno Premiani," [...] whose influences showed in his [...] "early crude stabs at drawing comics." [...] The young Bolland did not rate Marvel Comics as highly as DC, feeling the covers cluttered and the paper quality crude. His appreciation of the artwork of Jack Kirby, he says, only materialised much later [...] "through {{the eyes of a}} seasoned professional." [...] He did however enjoy UK comics, including newspaper strips such as [...] "Syd Jordan's Jeff Hawke [...] David Wright's Carol Day, [...] " [...] and Valiant which featured [...] "Eric Bradbury's Mytek the Mighty and Jesus Blasco's Steel Claw [...] " [...] Despite such a variety of inspirations, Bolland credits his eventual pursuance of art as a hobby and then vocation to a primary school art teacher, who [...] "evidently said all the right things to me." ...|$|R

Prior to defecting, Károlyi hinted a few times to Comăneci that he might attempt to do so and indirectly asked if she wanted to join him. At that time, she had no interest in defecting and said she wanted to go home to Romania. However, after the defection of the Károlyis, life changed drastically for Comăneci in ways she could not predict. Officials feared that she would also defect, and her actions were strictly monitored; she was no longer allowed to travel outside of Romania.|$|R
60|$|I know, Ned Phipps, who knelt against me, and I am sure made me behave {{much worse}} than I should have done without him, whispered that he thought the Bishop was a 'guy', and I {{certainly}} <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Prendergast looked much more dignified with his plain white surplice and black hair. He was a tall commanding man, and read the Liturgy in a strikingly sonorous and uniform voice, which I tried to imitate the next Sunday at home, until my little sister began to cry, and said I was 'yoaring at her'.|$|E
60|$|Another hour; {{the slope}} of the great peak could not be more than two miles away now. A couple of hundred yards off grew a large baobab tree. Could we reach its shade? We had done half the {{distance}} when Indaba-zimbi fell from exhaustion. We were now so weak that neither of us could lift the child on to our backs. He rose again, and we each took one of her hands and dragged her along the road. Fifty yards--they seemed to be fifty miles. Ah, the tree was reached at last; compared with the heat outside, the shade of its dense foliage seemed like the dusk and cool of a vault. I <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> it was a good place to die in. Then I remember no more.|$|E
60|$|He {{had just}} renounced his velveteen, {{and even those}} cuffs turned {{backward}} over the sleeves, and had begun to dress very carefully in the fashion of the moment. He lived in a little house at Chelsea that the architect Godwin had decorated with an elegance that owed something to Whistler. There was nothing mediaeval, nor Pre-Raphaelite, no cupboard door with figures upon flat gold, no peacock blue, no dark background. I remember vaguely a white drawing room with Whistler etchings, 'let in' to white panels, and a dining room all white: chairs, walls, mantlepiece, carpet, except for a diamond-shaped piece of red cloth {{in the middle of}} the table under a terra cotta statuette, and I think a red shaded lamp hanging from the ceiling to a little above the statuette.

5000|$|Wright {{was born}} in Hamilton, Ontario. He was adopted by an {{engineering}} technician, was raised in Burlington and {{spent some time in}} England. His parents were not wealthy. He graduated [...] "With High Distinction" [...] from the University of Toronto's Trinity College with a B.A. degree in Politics and Economics, where his classmates included Jim Balsillie, Malcolm Gladwell, Tony Clement, Andrew Coyne, Patricia Pearson, and author and political strategist John Duffy (not related to Mike Duffy). Wright was noted early on as a talented student. A political opponent and former classmate said that [...] "back in the day, the question was 'Will Nigel be on the Supreme Court or be prime minister?’ He worked harder than anybody and he was pretty much the smartest guy in the room." [...] Jim Balsillie, the co-founder of BlackBerry Ltd, <b>remembered</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> he would have to [...] "seriously up his inspiration levels if was going to keep up with this kid." [...] English-Canadian author Malcolm Gladwell recalls him as “an exceedingly decent, sweet and good-natured person”, who appeared more mature and directed than his peers. “He just seemed like he had a much clearer sense of who he was than the rest of us.” ...|$|R

60|$|Only once in {{her life}} had Betty met her stepfather's celebrated aunt, and the meeting had taken place nearly twelve years ago. The figure that {{remained}} in her memory was of a pale-eyed, grenadier-like old lady, almost entirely surrounded by clocks. It was these clocks that had impressed her most. She {{was too young to}} be awed by the knowledge that the tall old woman who stared at her just like a sandy cat she had once possessed was one of the three richest women in the whole wide world. She only <b>remembered</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> the finger which emerged from the plaid shawl and prodded her cheek was unpleasantly bony. But the clocks had absorbed her. It was as if all the clocks in the world had been gathered together into that one room. There had been big clocks, with almost human faces; small, perky clocks; clocks of strange shape; and one dingy, medium-sized clock in particular which had made her cry out with delight. Her visit had chanced to begin shortly before eleven in the morning, and she had not been in the room ten minutes before there was a whirring, and the majority of the clocks began to announce the hour, each after its own fashion--some with a slow bloom, some with a rapid, bell-like sound. But the medium-sized clock, unexpectedly belying its appearance of being nothing of particular importance, had performed its task in a way quite distinct from the others. It had suddenly produced from its interior a shabby little gold man with a trumpet, who had blown eleven little blasts before sliding backward into his house and shutting the door after him. Betty had waited in rapt silence till he finished, and had then shouted eagerly for more.|$|R
60|$|When {{they reached}} the dairy Mr and Mrs Crick were {{promptly}} told--with injunctions of secrecy; {{for each of the}} lovers was desirous that the marriage should be kept as private as possible. The dairyman, though he had thought of dismissing her soon, now made a great concern about losing her. What should he do about his skimming? Who would make the ornamental butter-pats for the Anglebury and Sandbourne ladies? Mrs Crick congratulated Tess on the shilly-shallying having at last come to an end, and said that directly she set eyes on Tess she divined that she was to be the chosen one of somebody who was no common outdoor man; Tess had looked so superior as she walked across the barton on that afternoon of her arrival; that she was of a good family she could have sworn. In point of fact Mrs Crick did <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> Tess was graceful and good-looking as she approached; but the superiority might have been a growth of the imagination aided by subsequent knowledge.|$|E
6000|$|My {{knowledge}} of Mr. William Morris's poetry begins in years {{so far away}} that they seem like reminiscences of another existence. I remember sitting beneath Cardinal Beaton's ruined castle at St. Andrews, looking across the bay to the sunset, while some one repeated [...] "Two Red Roses across the Moon." [...] And I <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> the poem was nonsense. With Mr. Morris's other early verses, [...] "The Defence of Guinevere," [...] this song of {{the moon and the}} roses was published in 1858. Probably the little book won no attention; it is not popular even now. Yet the lyrics remain in memories which forget all but a general impression of the vast [...] "Earthly Paradise," [...] that huge decorative poem, in which slim maidens and green-clad men, and waters wan, and flowering apple trees, and rich palaces are all mingled as on some long ancient tapestry, shaken a little by the wind of death. They are not living and breathing people, these persons of the fables; they are but shadows, beautiful and faint, and their poem is fit reading for sleepy summer afternoons. But the characters in the lyrics in [...] "The Defence of Guinevere" [...] are people of flesh and blood, under their chain armour and their velvet, and the trappings of their tabards.|$|E
6000|$|I saw a {{good deal}} of Wilde at that time--was it 1887 or 1888?--I have no way of fixing the date except that I had {{published}} my first book The Wanderings of Usheen and that Wilde had not yet published his Decay of Lying. He had, before our first meeting, reviewed my book and despite its vagueness of intention, and the inexactness of its speech, praised without qualification; and what was worth more than any review he had talked about it and now he asked me to eat my Christmas dinner with him believing, I imagine, that I was alone in London. He had just renounced his velveteen, and even those cuffs turned backward over the sleeves, and had begun to dress very carefully in the fashion of the moment.

[...] "At one point I had sort of an epiphany, sitting at my desk looking out over the bush, when I realized I wanted to do engineering for developing countries", Smith said. [...] "In Botswana, I was teaching and then working for the ministry of agriculture as a beekeeper, and I <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> to myself <b>that</b> I really liked doing development work, but I wished could do some engineering too, because I like creative problem solving", says Smith.

40|$|Think {{about the}} last time you had a cold and your nose was blocked. Do you <b>remember</b> eating and <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> your food had less fl avor? That’s because most of what we “taste ” is {{actually}} being sensed by our olfactory system. The word olfaction is actually based on the Latin word olfacere, which means to smell. In contrast to taste, where humans can only perceive fi ve qualities (sour, bitter, sweet, salty, and umami), humans can smell thousands of odorants. Odorants can reach the olfactory epithelium by two routes. The fi rst route, orthonasal olfaction, is the detection of an odor through the nostrils by sniffi ng or inhalation. The second route, retronasal olfaction, is the detection of an odorant when it is released from food in your mouth during chewing, exhalation, or swallowing. During this process, the odorant passes through the posterior nares of the nasopharynx (or the back of the nose; retro-means backward). Once in the olfactory epithelium, odor molecules bind to olfactory receptor...|$|R
