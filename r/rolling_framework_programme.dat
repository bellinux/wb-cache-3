40|$|This {{paper will}} analyse {{the nature of}} the EU <b>Framework</b> <b>Programme,</b> {{particularly}} its degree of market-orientation and precompetitiveness, {{at the time of the}} Fourth <b>Framework</b> <b>Programme.</b> The paper will show that precompetitiveness as a project or participation attribute is independent of technology or market orientation, with technology orientation meaning participation in the <b>Framework</b> <b>Programme</b> for learning and knowledge, market orientation for commercial objectives. Technology or market orientations appear almost as frequently as basic motivations for company participation in the programme. However, companies usually choose one of the two as their collaboration mode. The paper will further show that the <b>Framework</b> <b>Programme</b> participation by firms continues to be mainly precompetitive.

40|$|Climate changes, energy security, {{population}} ageing {{and other}} contemporary world challenges necessitate an international cooperation {{in order to}} take advantage of the resources and to coordinate all the countries’ investments for a long-lasting development.

The international scientific and technological cooperation has always been part of the European Union research policy, from the moment when the first <b>Framework</b> <b>Programme</b> was launched in 1983.
