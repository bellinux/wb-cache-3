5|$|The tawny {{nurse shark}} {{may be one of}} the few fishes specializing in preying on octopus. Other known food items include corals, sea urchins, {{crustaceans}} (e.g. crabs and lobsters), squid, small fishes (e.g. surgeonfish, queenfish, and <b>rabbitfish),</b> and the occasional sea snake. Hunting {{tawny nurse shark}}s swim slowly just above the sea floor, poking their heads into depressions and holes. When a prey item is found, the shark forcefully expands its large, muscular pharynx, creating a powerful negative pressure that sucks the prey into its mouth.|$|E

25|$|Copepods {{and other}} {{zooplankton}} are plentiful in the North Sea. These tiny organisms are crucial {{elements of the}} food chain supporting many species of fish. Over 230 species of fish live in the North Sea. Cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole, mackerel, herring, pouting, sprat, and sandeel are all very common and are fished commercially. Due to the various depths of the North Sea trenches and differences in salinity, temperature, and water movement, some fish such as blue-mouth redfish and <b>rabbitfish</b> reside only in small areas of the North Sea.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rabbitfishes</b> or spinefoots are perciform fishes in {{the family}} Siganidae. The 28 species are in a single genus, Siganus. In some now {{obsolete}} classifications, the species having prominent face stripes - colloquially called foxfaces - are in the genus Lo. Other species, such as the masked spinefoot (S. puellus), show a reduced form of the stripe pattern. <b>Rabbitfishes</b> are native to shallow waters in the Indo-Pacific, but S. luridus and S. rivulatus have become established in the eastern Mediterranean via Lessepsian migration.

40|$|<b>Rabbitfishes</b> are reef-associated fishes {{that support}} local {{fisheries}} throughout the Indo-West Pacific region. Sound {{management of the}} resource requires the development of molecular tools for appropriate stock delimitation of the different species in the family. Microsatellite markers were developed for the cordonnier, Siganus sutor, and their potential for cross-amplification was investigated in 12 congeneric species. A library of 792 repeat-containing sequences was built. Nineteen sets of newly developed primers, and 14 universal finfish microsatellites were tested in S. sutor. Amplification success of the 19 Siganus-specific markers ranged from 32 to 79 % in the 12 other Siganus species, slightly decreasing when the genetic distance of the target species to S. sutor increased. Seventeen of these markers were polymorphic in S. sutor and were further assayed in S. luridus, S. rivulatus, and S. spinus, of which respectively 9, 10 and 8 were polymorphic. Statistical power analysis and an analysis of molecular variance showed that subtle genetic differentiation can be detected using these markers, highlighting their utility {{for the study of}} genetic diversity and population genetic structure in <b>rabbitfishes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstractâ€”Many {{coral reef}} fish species {{aggregate}} at specific times and locations {{for the purpose}} of spawning. This study examined the spatial and temporal distribution of spawning aggregations in the Seychelles. An interview-based survey of the principal stakeholders, mainly artisanal fishers, yielded 89 reports of aggregation fishing for 26 demersal and semi-pelagic fish species. Grouper aggregations were largely concentrated in the outer coralline islands of the exclusive economic zone, whilst those of snappers and <b>rabbitfishes</b> were mainly reported from locations on the Seychelles Bank. The spatial patterns among fish families were attributed to a combination of differences in species abundance and distribution as well as variation in fishing effort. Spawning periodicity reported by fishers indicated that for snappers and <b>rabbitfishes,</b> the most activity occurred across a protracted period of October to April/May, with peaks in activity at either end of that period. Grouper spawning activity was concentrated in the northeast monsoon months of November to January. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} several spawning aggregations are targeted by fishers on a regular basis, a practice that constitutes a primary issue for artisanal fisheries research and management in the Seychelles...|$|R

40|$|Abstractâ€”Fish {{samples and}} catch data were {{collected}} monthly from traditional basket fish traps set on reefs within the Dar es Salaam Marine Reserves (DMRs) to evaluate trap catch dynamics and reproductive biology of the rabbit fish Siganus sutor (Valenciennes 1835). Trap catch composition was 85 % <b>rabbitfishes</b> by weight with a mean (Â± SE) catch per unit effort (CPUE) of 2. 8 Â± 0. 1 kg trap- 1 day- 1 during a fishing season, which lasted between September 2004 and May 2005. CPUE {{did not differ significantly}} with lunar cycle, but exhibited a spatial variation, the highest being from Fungu Yasini Marine Reserve, which is further from shore. The spawning season of S. sutor is protracted, lasting between October and May, peaking in March. Size at first sexual maturity was 217. 1 and 227. 7 mm TL for male and female S. sutor, respectively. The species exhibits a size-dependent sex ratio, with a preponderance of females at larger sizes. The species shows high fecundity at a maximum of 1, 300, 400 oocytes for 396 mm TL female. Average (Â± SE) total fecundity was 627, 052 Â± 78, 886 oocytes per female of 266 to 396 mm TL.

40|$|The main {{purposes}} of this study are to find out the temporal fluctuation of marine fish community based on impingement data collected at the Second Nuclear Power Plant in recent years (September 2000 to May 2004), and to compare the recent fish community structure data to that of an earlier period, around 14 years ago (July 1987 to April 1990). Comparison of the data collected recently to that collected 14 years ago showed that there were no yearly or monthly differences. However, the community structures reflected by clustering dendro-grams or MDS ordination plots were quite different between earlier and recent years. This difference is likely due to the drastic changes in the dominant species. Fourteen years ago, the most dominant species was mullet (Mugil cephalus), but now, it has changed to lower economic species like <b>rabbitfishes</b> (Siganus fuscescens) and spiny puffer (Diodon holocanthus). This phenomenon might reflect the declination in our fishery resources due to overfishing; a trend espe-cially clear in those species with higher economic values...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of ecological processes on coral reefs was examined based on Eocene fossil fishes from Monte Bolca, Italy and extant species from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Using ecologically relevant morphological metrics, we investigated the {{evolution of}} herbivory in surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae) and <b>rabbitfishes</b> (Siganidae). Eocene and Recent surgeonfishes showed remarkable similarities, with grazers, browsers and even specialized, long-snouted forms having Eocene analogues. These long-snouted Eocene species were probably pair-forming, crevice-feeding forms like their Recent counterparts. Although Eocene surgeonfishes likely {{played a critical role}} as herbivores during the origins of modern coral reefs, they lacked the novel morphologies seen in modern Acanthurus and Siganus (including eyes positioned high above their low-set mouths). Today, these forms dominate coral reefs in both abundance and species richness and are associated with feeding on shallow, exposed algal turfs. The radiation of these new forms, and their expansion into new habitats in the Oligocene-Miocene, reflects the second phase in the development of fish herbivory on coral reefs that is closely associated with the exploitation of highly productive short algal turfs...|$|R
