50|$|With Generation III, the Chrysler minivans were {{available}} in long- and short- wheelbase models; three- and four-door configurations; and eight different powertrains, including electric and compressed natural gas; on a single, flexible platform.In development for nearly 5 years from early 1990 (full development from 1991) to December 26, 1994 (final design by Don Renkert was approved on September 23, 1991 and frozen in May 1992), the 1996 model was introduced at the 1995 North American International Auto Show using the Chrysler NS platform. Gone were its K-car underpinnings and architecture, replaced with more modern components and Chrysler's acclaimed cab-forward design. It included a number of innovations, including a driver's side sliding door (optional initially, to become standard equipment later), a first for Chrysler and a non-compact minivan for the United States & Canada (the Honda Odyssey had introduced the first four-door non-compact minivan for the United States & Canada in 1994, although the first-generation Odyssey had conventional hinged rear doors). With Generation III, Chrysler introduced a seat management system marketed as Easy Out Roller Seats: When installed, the 2nd and 3rd row seats (either bucket or bench seats) were latched to floor-mounted strikers. When unlatched, eight rollers lifted each seat, allowing it to be rolled fore and aft. Tracks had locator depressions for rollers, thus enabling simple installation. Ergonomic levers at the seatbacks released the floor latches single-handedly without tools and raised the seats onto the rollers in a single motion. Additionally, seatbacks were designed to fold forward. Seat <b>roller</b> <b>tracks</b> were permanently attached {{to the floor and}} seat stanchions were aligned, facilitating the longitudinal rolling of the seats. Bench seat stanchions were moved inboard to reduce bending stress in the seat frames, allowing them to be lighter. A conventional door handle and lock was added to the rear hatch, eliminating the confusing pop-and-lift maneuver which had been required on earlier models. The new minivans earned unanimous critical acclaim: the Dodge Caravan was the 1996 Motor Trend Car of the Year, and the vans were on Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list for 1996 and 1997.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} {{fundamentally}} {{relevant to the}} development of a new enhanced <b>Roller</b> <b>Track</b> Gate (RTG) for the gravity type Self-unloading Bulk Carriers (SULS), called the Multi-functional <b>Roller</b> <b>Track</b> Gate (MRG). Self-unloading Bulk Carriers (SULS) are specialized types of dry bulk carrier vessels, principally because these ships discharge their cargoes without the assistance of external sources. In 1908, the first commercial vessel of these types started trading in the Great Lakes region of North America. Subsequent to the inception of SULS, the technology has developed mainly in the hull structure and onboard unloading systems. Due to the 1980 s GL shipping recession, SULS migrated internationally and are now trading worldwide. Eight gravity gates for SULS were investigated in detail prior to designing the MRG. These examinations of previous gates were primarily to address the inherent issues and develop a new gate that would correct the current problems, when discharging dry bulk cargo with the existing gravity gates. The newly designed gate is accompanied with special control system that improves the discharging operations of these type vessels. This gate resulted in being heavier when compared to the existing RTG. However, this study also addresses and mitigates the associated improvements in this new type gate that increases the ship’s lightweight with the possibility of increasing payload / deadweight. High tensile steel was introduced for the hull to compensate for the added gate weight. The steel weight reduction investigation resulted in greater weight than what was required for offsetting the gate weight. The additional weight savings allowed for greater cargo lift for the vessels examined. The economic case study confirmed that by replacing the present <b>Roller</b> <b>Track</b> Gate with the Multi-functional <b>Roller</b> <b>Track</b> Gate, the shipowners’ would benefit from improve discharging performance, less port turn around time and reduced manning cost.
