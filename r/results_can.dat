5|$|Fermi, {{learning}} of Ulam's breakthrough, devised an analog computer {{known as the}} Monte Carlo trolley, later dubbed the FERMIAC. The device performed a mechanical simulation of random diffusion of neutrons. As computers improved in speed and programmability, these methods became more useful. In particular, many Monte Carlo calculations carried out on modern massively parallel supercomputers are embarrassingly parallel applications, whose <b>results</b> <b>can</b> be very accurate.|$|E
5|$|Linear probing {{can provide}} high {{performance}} {{because of its}} good locality of reference, but is {{more sensitive to the}} quality of its hash function than some other collision resolution schemes. It takes constant expected time per search, insertion, or deletion when implemented using a random hash function, a 5-independent hash function, or tabulation hashing. However, good <b>results</b> <b>can</b> be achieved in practice with other hash functions such as MurmurHash.|$|E
5|$|Search <b>results</b> <b>can</b> be {{filtered}} {{according to}} a number of criteria, including specifying a range of years such as '1945 to 1975', '2000 to the present day' or 'before 1900', and what type of journal the article appears in – non-peer reviewed articles such as conference proceedings can be excluded or specifically searched for, or specific journals can be included in or excluded from the search.|$|E

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} and classification of AML can be challenging, {{and should be}} performed by a qualified hematopathologist or hematologist. In straightforward cases, the presence of certain morphologic features (such as Auer rods) or specific flow cytometry <b>results</b> <b>can</b> distinguish AML from other leukemias; however, {{in the absence of}} such features, diagnosis may be more difficult.|$|E
5|$|A 2016 phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{conducted by}} Sachs et al. found two equally strong alternative placements of Brancasaurus (including Gronausaurus): within the Leptocleididae; {{or as the}} sister taxon of a clade containing both Leptocleididae and Polycotylidae, with the clade containing all of the aforementioned taxa being the sister taxon of Elasmosauridae. The study concluded that, currently, no phylogenetic dataset is sufficient to resolve the relationships of Brancasaurus. In addition {{to the fact that}} the type specimen is a subadult, this inconsistency in <b>results</b> <b>can</b> be attributed to the mix of leptocleidid, polycotylid, and elasmosaurid characteristics that is seen in Brancasaurus. The cladograms below illustrate the alternate arrangements.|$|E
5|$|Similar <b>results</b> <b>can</b> be {{extended}} from closed curves to unbounded curves satisfying a local Lipschitz condition. For such curves, if {{both sides of}} the curve have infinite area, then the evolved curve remains smooth and singularity-free for all time. However, if one side of an unbounded curve has finite area, and the curve has finite total absolute curvature, then its evolution reaches a singularity in time proportional to the area on the finite-area side of the curve, with unbounded curvature near the singularity. For curves that are graphs of sufficiently well-behaved functions, asymptotic to a ray in each direction, the solution converges in shape to a unique shape that is asymptotic to the same rays.|$|E

25|$|In practice, the test's <b>results</b> <b>can</b> {{easily be}} {{dominated}} {{not by the}} computer's intelligence, but by the attitudes, skill, or naïveté of the questioner.|$|E
25|$|Confirmability is a {{qualitative}} concept {{analogous to the}} concept of objectivity in quantitative research. It {{is the degree to which}} research <b>results</b> <b>can</b> be confirmed by other researchers.|$|E
