5|$|STS-300 was the {{designation}} for the Space Shuttle Launch on Need (LON) missions {{to be launched}} on short notice for STS-114 and STS-121, {{in the event that}} the shuttle became disabled or damaged and could not safely return to Earth. The <b>rescue</b> flight for STS-115, if needed, would have been STS-301. After STS-115, the <b>rescue</b> mission designations were based on the corresponding regular mission that would be replaced should the <b>rescue</b> mission be needed. For example, the STS-116 <b>rescue</b> mission was branded STS-317, because the normal mission scheduled after STS-116 was STS-117. Should the <b>rescue</b> mission have been needed, the crew and vehicle for STS-117 would assume the <b>rescue</b> mission profile and become STS-317. All potential <b>rescue</b> missions were to be launched with a crew of four, and would return with ten or eleven crew members, depending on the number of crew launched on the rescued shuttle. Missions were expected to last approximately eleven days. None of the planned contingency missions was ever flown.|$|E
