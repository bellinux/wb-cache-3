Specifically, we project all the correspondences into the Hough space, and determine the correctness of the correspondences by their respective densities. In this way, mutual verification of <b>relevant</b> <b>correspondences</b> is activated, and the precision of matching is boosted. On the other hand, we infer the concerted homographies propagated from the locally grouped features, and enrich the correspondence candidates for each feature. The recall is hence increased. The two processes are tightly coupled. Through iterative optimization, plausible enrichments are gradually revealed while more correct correspondences are detected. Promising experimental results on three benchmark datasets manifest the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 1...|$|R

Method: We propose a registration algorithm endorsing this vascular tree nature by providing a pairing procedure that preserves the tree topology and by integrating this pairing into an iterative algorithm maintaining pairing coherence. In addition, we define two complementary error measures quantifying the resulting alignment error and pairing error. Both are based on manual ground-truth that is independent of the type of transformation to retrieve. Results: Experiments were conducted on a database of 63 clinical cases, evaluating robustness and accuracy of our approach with respect to the iterative closest point algorithm.

He went down to Tunbridge Wells with a mind made up against the treaty, and, though he drafted the blank commission and transmitted it to Holland, he fully approved, {{if he did not}} inspire, the letter with which Somers accompanied it (28 August 1698). When the treaty was signed he drafted the necessary forms of ratification and procured their authentication by Somers under the great seal. With Somers alone of the ministers in England, he shared the secret of the separate articles. When the treaty came before the notice of parliament, Portland, who bore the first brunt of the attack, sought to share his responsibility with Vernon, whom he represented as cognisant of and concurring in the negotiation from the outset. Vernon cleared himself from this charge by producing with the king's leave the <b>relevant</b> <b>correspondence,</b> and, though no less responsible than Somers for the course taken at Tunbridge Wells, he was omitted from the articles of impeachment and was continued in office.

This chance meeting between a pilot and the Chief Ambulance Officer for Cornwall was to prove fortuitous. Newman {{had been working on}} a parallel project in the Gloucester area when Holden suggested that his efforts should be directed towards the needs of Cornwall. Holden knew that his new Head of Primary care, David Green, an ex-RAF aviator of some standing, was supportive of the general concept of a Helicopter Emergency Medical Service. It was Newman's decision to approach Stephen Bond of Bond Helicopters Ltd that was to prove to be the catalyst for the successful deployment of the air ambulance the following year. Visiting Stephen Bond in the autumn of 1986 Newman suggested that the provision of a helicopter free of charge for a three-month trial period would allow the British public to see how such a service could improve emergency care. Stephen Bond's decision to agree to this proposal and the interesting exchanges with David Green during this critical phase are available in Newman's archives and clearly show how the project moved from concept to successful execution. (note - <b>relevant</b> <b>correspondence</b> can be published where required). Subsequently, Newman was retained by Bond Helicopters Limited (Bond), initially as their local project manager in which role he produced the first draft of the contract, and then as their pilot.

They are not only successors as the owners of their farms but also successors as the managers of their farms. This paper deals with the latter, with special reference to the farms in the district for protected cultivation (flowers and vegetables). First, we classify the new type of farmers according to the degree of their positiveness toward farming, based on a fact-finding survey regarding them (35 years of age or less) from Akabane town, Aichi Prefecture. Second, we investigated the relationship between their attitude toward farming and the various manager factors (age, marriage, career, status), using the econometric method (the Multinominal Logit Model). Third, we analyzed the successors' consciousness regarding their farming and their perspectives for agricultural production in this district. Major findings of the study are as follows: 1) There are <b>relevant</b> <b>correspondences</b> between the successors' attitude toward farming and the various manager factors. 2) However, the career factor (experiences as a man leaving home after completion of high-school) is the strongest contribution to their positiveness toward farming. 3) The farm successors who experienced college life and / or farming training leaving home, have positive ideas and practices toward the advance techniques regarding agriculture. Therefore, they are qualified as the agricultural leaders of the next generation. この研究の目的は，農業後継者たちが，成功的な農業経営者を目指してどのように彼ら自身の人的資本を蓄積するかを研究するものである。一般的に言って，日本農業においては彼らは二面性を持っている。彼らは，農場所有者としての後継者ばかりではなく，農場経営者としての後継者でもある。この論文は，とりわけ施設園芸(花きおよび野菜) 地帯における農場に言及しながら，このうちの後者について論じるものである。 まず最初に，われわれは愛知県赤羽根町における 35 歳以下の農業経営者を対象とする事実発見的な調査にもとづきながら，営農に対する積極的な態度の程度に応じて階層分けを行った。第 2 に，われわれは営農に対する態度といろいろな経営者要因(年齢，結婚，経歴，地位) との関係を，計量経済学的な手法(多選択ロジットモデル) を使って調べた。第 3 に，われわれは，後継者たちの営農に対する意識とその地域の農業生産の展望について研究した。 研究の主要な発見はつぎの通りである。 1) 後継者たちの営農に対する態度といろいろな経営者要因との間には，適切な対応関係がある。 2) しかしながら，経歴要因(高校卒業後の自分の家を離れての一人の人間としての経験) が営農への積極的態度に対して最も強い貢献をしている。 3) 自分の家を離れての大学生活や営農研修を経験した農業後継者たちは，地域農業の発展に対して積極的な考えと行動を採っている。それゆえ、彼らは次世代のリーダーとして相応しい資格を有すると考えられる...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is the {{exploration}} of an optimality theoretic architecture for syntax that is guided by the concept of "correspondence": syntax is understood as the mechanism of “translating” underlying representations into a surface form.

The empirical domain where this architecture is tested are minimal link effects, {{especially in the case of}} "wh"-movement. The OT constraints require the surface form to reflect the underlying semantic and syntactic representations as maximally as possible. The means by which underlying relations and properties are encoded are precedence, adjacency, surface morphology and prosodic structure.

40|$|The {{increase}} in the complexity and variability of the business environment, due to constant and rapid changes in markets, calls for more flexible and effective production systems. Of the most valuable production systems, the Japanese lean production system (LPS) is the best known and studied, but is still not the most widely applied with success outside Japan. The reason for {{the low level of}} success of lean production outside its native country is the lack of understanding of the strong interactions which hold between enterprises and business systems. In order to fill this gap in our knowledge, we investigate the systemic interactions according to the Viable System View. To develop our analysis, we combine the elements of two of the major viable systems theories: the Viable System Model (VSM) of Stafford Beer, and the Viable System Approach (VSA) of Gaetano Golinelli. We combine these two perspectives to create a cohesive framework that combines the internal structural analysis of VSM with the analysis of links to the environmental suprasystems of VSA. In line with this framework, we examine the peculiar aspects of the Japanese lean production system in order to find the <b>relevant</b> <b>correspondences</b> between the Japanese LPS and the Viable Systems perspective. We portray the peculiarities of the lean production system, shedding light on its roots in the Japanese business environment (Dominici, 2008, 2010), and we show how it has worked as an incubator to create those managerial practices that represent the LPS.

Correlation analysis on individual subjects reveals a <b>relevant</b> <b>correspondence</b> between LF/HF and subjective alertness during the initial hours of sleep deprivation. At longer times awake, high correlation levels between LF/HF and objective performance indicate an increasing sympathetic drive as performance measures worsen.

40|$|Tagore {{is viewed}} {{through the medium}} of five books of essays which he wrote in English. Most of the essays are the texts of lectures Tagore {{delivered}} to audiences in England and America. They are important because they constitute what Tagore actually communicated to audiences and readers in the West during his tours outside India. The five books are taken chronologically in the chapters of this thesis, each one being a stage on Tagore’s journey. They are read in conjunction with information about his activities in India prior to each particular tour, his encounters during the trip, and any <b>relevant</b> <b>correspondence,</b> in order better to understand the ideas he expresses. A key finding from close study of the essays {{is the extent to which}} Tagore draws on his understanding of the evolution and special capabilities of the human species. This philosophical anthropology, or ‘deep anthropology’, is used to describe what mankind ought to be, as well as what we are. Tagore was critical of what he considered the dehumanising economic systems of the West, which were supported by educational methods that focussed narrowly on training people to participate in such systems. The ideal behind the design of Tagore’s own practical projects was a modernised and less restrictive form of traditional society, comprising networks of self sustaining villages or small communities, where children and young people are encouraged to develop their natural curiosity and creativity, and to express themselves freely with body and mind. Tagore’s approach to education and rural reconstruction, if implemented widely as he intended, could lead to a radical redesign of society, a turning of the world upside down.

40|$|Multinational {{cross-cultural}} manning of merchant ships {{is not a}} new {{element in}} shipping. Today, however, the phenomenon, is common and takes place under other economic auspices than before. The situation has led to various solutions. Two of them are to put a ship under foreign flag with special ship management or to keep the national flag and man the ship partly with foreign nationals employed under special agreements. This study aims at finding the cultural shipboard dimensions of multinational crews within a framework of organisational psychology. The research method was built upon a base of literature studies. The task was to perform case studies of three ships and three shipping companies representing the above mentioned categories. An element {{of the study was to}} examine how the ISM code complied with the organisational culture. The research method implied the researcher’s presence onboard during a voyage. During the voyages interviews with the crew members were carried out. Sequences of work were documented by field observations and walking around observations. Observant participating in meetings and crewmembers’ professional- and social conversation took place. <b>Relevant</b> <b>correspondence</b> and documentation were also analysed. Daily meetings with the ship management were performed to consolidate the observations made. The companies’ head offices were visited in order to obtain a holistic view of the interaction between shipboard management and central management functions ashore and to follow up findings from the study. The analytical work was composed of an iterative process of alternating collecting of data writing down field notes and listening to interviews. The final synthesis was the integration of the data in an explanatory framework. The conceptual or explanatory framework reflects the cultural psychological view that culture is composed of artifacts, espoused values and basic assumptions, which together are governing the actions of the involved parties. The analysis of the cases has also included elements of the cultural historical activity theory as well as the cultural web model. Special attention has been given to the onboard conditions of the language to serve as the tool for distribution of knowledge. The study also reflects over the contrast between the traditional perspective on human error and that of a sociocultural view. Furthermore is discussed the relations between viewing the safety management as a ”system” or as an expression of ”culture”. In addition, the results from the study are in brief the following. Safety manuals have a discourse which presents the safety management systems as a break down of a complex whole. That means that the real world is not reflected in a holistic view which leads to a critical reduction of facts. A remedy is to apply culture, especially safety culture, as an interlinking component. Another result is that shipboard work as a ”context” presents a mediating artifact to create co-operation and understanding between individuals when different cultures come together. Human error appears to be explainable in terms of cultural dimensions. An important aspect of cultural management appears to be the avoiding of feelings of ”we and them”, originating from socio-economic conditions. Misunderstandings across cultures occur when people make different attributions to explain specific behaviour. Finally a model for cultural management is presented using the observations and results from the study. Godkänd; 2003; 20061106 (haneit...|$|E

We study in some depth a data set of financial futures (daily highs) {{in order to show}} that this approach to faint pattern finding, at an appropriate resolution level, works very well in practice...|$|R
