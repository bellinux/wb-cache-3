40|$|As of November, 1993, 303 <b>research</b> <b>reactors</b> (<b>research,</b> test, training, prototype, and {{electricity}} producing) were operational worldwide; 155 {{of these were}} in non-nuclear weapon states. Of these 155 <b>research</b> <b>reactors,</b> 80 are thermal reactors that have a power rating of 1 MW(th) or greater and could be utilized to produce plutonium. A previously published study on the unreported plutonium production of six <b>research</b> <b>reactors</b> indicates that a minimum reactor power of 40 MW (th) is required to make a significant quantity (SQ), 8 kg, of fissile plutonium per year by unreported irradiations. As part of the Global Nuclear Material Control Model effort, we determined an upper bound on the maximum possible quantity of plutonium that could be produced by the 80 thermal <b>research</b> <b>reactors</b> in the non-nuclear weapon states (NNWS). We estimate that in one year a maximum of roughly one quarter of a metric ton (250 kg) of plutonium could be produced in these 80 NNWS thermal <b>research</b> <b>reactors</b> based on their reported power output.

5|$|Under Boyd's purview, the Engineering Experiment Station {{was awarded}} many electronics-related contracts, {{to the extent}} that an Electronics Division was created in 1959; it focused on radar and communications. In 1955, Georgia Tech {{president}} Blake R. Van Leer appointed Boyd to Georgia Tech's Nuclear Science Committee. The committee recommended the creation of a Radioisotopes Laboratory Facility and the construction of a large <b>research</b> <b>reactor.</b> The former was built and dedicated on January 7, 1959, and could receive, store, and process radioactive materials. The Frank H. Neely <b>Research</b> <b>Reactor</b> was completed in 1963 and was operational until 1996, when the fuel was removed because of safety concerns related to the nearby 1996 Summer Olympics events. In 1961, Boyd was succeeded in the directorship by Robert E. Stiemke, who had previously been the director of Georgia Tech's School of Civil Engineering.|$|E

The Petten reactor had a 6-month scheduled maintenance shutdown on Friday, February 19, 2010, and reopened September 2010. With millions of procedures relying on technetium-99m every year, the low supply has left a gap, leaving some practitioners to revert to techniques not used for 20 years.

At the Engineering Experiment Station, Boyd helped spur the organization's mainstay: federally funded electronics research and development. Along with fellow Georgia Tech researchers Gerald Rosselot and Glen P. Robinson, Boyd was influential in the founding of Scientific Atlanta, where he was a board member for 25 years. As director of the Engineering Experiment Station, Boyd focused on the recruitment of talented engineers and an increase in physical space available to the organization, including the establishment of nuclear research at Georgia Tech with a radioisotopes laboratory and the construction of the Frank H.

5|$|Although Canada was a {{major source}} of uranium ore and heavy water, these were {{controlled}} by the Americans. Anglo-American cooperation broke down, denying the Montreal Laboratory scientists access to the materials they needed to build a reactor. In 1943, the Quebec Agreement merged Tube Alloys with the American Manhattan Project. The Americans agreed to help build the reactor. Scientists who were not British subjects left, and John Cockcroft became the new director of the Montreal Laboratory in May 1944. The Chalk River Laboratories opened in 1944, and the Montreal Laboratory was closed in July 1946. Two reactors were built at Chalk River. The small ZEEP went critical on 5 September 1945, and the larger NRX on 21 July 1947. NRX was for a time the most powerful <b>research</b> <b>reactor</b> in the world.|$|E
5|$|The nuclei {{of several}} hafnium {{isotopes}} can each absorb multiple neutrons. This makes hafnium a good material {{for use in}} the control rods for nuclear reactors. Its neutron-capture cross-section is about 600 times that of zirconium. (Other elements that are good neutron-absorbers for control rods are cadmium and boron.) Excellent mechanical properties and exceptional corrosion-resistance properties allow its use in the harsh environment of pressurized water reactors. The German <b>research</b> <b>reactor</b> FRM II uses hafnium as a neutron absorber. It is also common in military reactors, particularity in US naval reactors, but seldom found in civilian ones, the first core of the Shippingport Atomic Power Station (a conversion of a naval reactor) being a notable exception.|$|E

5|$|Through the 1950s {{increased}} funding advanced {{the place of}} sciences within the institution. In 1950, the university had completed the construction of three academic buildings for the sciences, all designed by local architect William Russell Souter. Public funding was eventually necessary to ensure the {{humanities and social sciences}} were given an equal place. Thus, in 1957 the University reorganized once again under The McMaster University Act, 1957, dissolving the two colleges. Its property was vested to McMaster and the university became a nondenominational institution eligible for public funding. The historic Baptist connection was continued through McMaster Divinity College, a separately chartered affiliated college of the university. Also in 1957, PhD programs were consolidated in a new Faculty of Graduate Studies. Construction of the McMaster Nuclear Reactor also began in 1957, and was the first university-based <b>research</b> <b>reactor</b> in the Commonwealth when it began operating in 1959.|$|E
5|$|The low-powered, graphite-moderated GLEEP, {{which stood}} for Graphite Low Energy Experimental Pile, was {{designed}} by the Montreal Laboratory, {{and became the first}} nuclear reactor to operate in Western Europe when it was started on 15 August 1947. This was followed by BEPO, a 6 MW <b>research</b> <b>reactor</b> designed by AERE, on 3 July 1948. Because heavy water was unavailable in Britain, BEPO was designed and built as a graphite-moderated reactor. Harwell was involved in the design of reactors at Windscale, and the chemical separation plant there. The passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) in August 1946, {{made it clear that the}} UK would no longer be allowed access to the United States' atomic research. This partly resulted from the arrest for espionage of Alan Nunn May in February 1946. Cockcroft helped negotiate a new, more informal and unsigned agreement with the Americans that was announced on 7 January 1948, known as the Modus Vivendi. The renewed cooperation that he hoped for under the agreement proved illusory. The development of the independent British nuclear deterrent led to the Atomic Energy Act being amended in 1958, and to a resumption of the nuclear Special Relationship between America and Britain under the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement.|$|E

40|$|Russian <b>research</b> <b>reactors</b> (RR) have {{a history}} of more than 60 years, which begins on December 26, 1946, when the first Russian RR – 24 kW uranium-graphite reactor F- 1 – was started in Moscow. This reactor is still in {{operation}} and is protected by the government as a monument to Russian scientific and engineering thought. The F- 1 reactor ushered in the era of nuclear power in Russia (USSR in those days) and gave rise to an important line in these activities, i. e. <b>reactor</b> engineering for <b>research</b> purposes. Russian <b>research</b> <b>reactors</b> had an eventful and far from easy way to go in their development. Like other major nuclear states, Russia took energetic efforts to provide its own <b>research</b> <b>reactors</b> in the period of 1950 s-‘ 80 s; it exported such reactors to other countries, and survived the nuclear stagnation {{of the end of the}} 20 th century through beginning of the 21 st century to keep its leading position in RR uses to the present day. Reforms in the Russian nuclear industry, the extensive experience in building <b>research</b> <b>reactors</b> both at home and abroad, together with the proactive export policy of the newly established public corporation “Rosatom ” form a groundwork for making Russia a more important player in the international market of <b>research</b> <b>reactors.</b> Today, Russia can offer a broad spectrum of services to foreign customers, ranging from conduct of specific experiments in its domestic reactors to building of scientific centres with <b>research</b> <b>reactors</b> at their core.
