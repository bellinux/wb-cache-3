50|$|The most {{difficult}} part of this process is welding the gold wire to the base layer, as the wire may have a larger diameter than the thickness of the base. To facilitate this operation, the gold wire is pointed or flattened until the end is thinner than the base layer. The tip of the gold wire is slid along the bar until electrical <b>resistance</b> <b>measurement</b> shows it is in contact with the base layer. At this time a pulse of current is applied, welding the wire in place. Unfortunately sometimes the weld is too large or slightly off center in the base layer. To avoid shorting the transistor, the gold wire is alloyed {{with a small amount of}} the same type dopant as used in the base. This causes the base layer to become slightly thicker at the point of the weld.|$|E

40|$|Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT) {{offers a}} {{non-destructive}} evaluation (NDE) technique that {{takes advantage of}} the inherent electrical properties in carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites for internal damage characterization. This paper investigates a method of optimum selection of sensing configurations for delamination detection in thick cross-ply laminates using ERT. Reduction in the number of sensing locations and measurements is necessary to minimize hardware and computational effort. The present work explores the use of an effective independence (EI) measure originally proposed for sensor location optimization in experimental vibration modal analysis. The EI measure is used for selecting the minimum set of <b>resistance</b> <b>measurements</b> among all possible combinations resulting from selecting sensing electrode pairs. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is applied to obtain a spectral representation of the <b>resistance</b> <b>measurements</b> in the laminate for subsequent EI based reduction to take place. The electrical potential field in a CFRP laminate is calculated using finite element analysis (FEA) applied on models for two different laminate layouts considering a set of specified delamination sizes and locations with two different sensing arrangements. The effectiveness of the EI measure in eliminating redundant electrode pairs is demonstrated by performing inverse identification of damage using the full set and the reduced set of <b>resistance</b> <b>measurements.</b> This investigation shows that the EI measure is effective for optimally selecting the electrode pairs needed for <b>resistance</b> <b>measurements</b> in ERT based damage detection...|$|R

40|$|The use of fiber-reinforced thermoplastics, {{for example}} in the {{aeronautical}} industry, is increasing rapidly. Therefore, there is an increasing need for in-situ monitoring tools, which preferably have limited influence on the behaviour of the material and which are easy to use.
