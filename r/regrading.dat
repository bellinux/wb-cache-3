5|$|The {{city itself}} is hilly, though not uniformly so. Like Rome, {{the city is}} said to lie on seven hills; the lists vary but {{typically}} include Capitol Hill, First Hill, West Seattle, Beacon Hill, Queen Anne, Magnolia, and the former Denny Hill. The Wallingford, Delridge, Mount Baker, Seward Park, Washington Park, Broadmoor, Madrona, Phinney Ridge, Sunset Hill, Blue Ridge, Broadview, Laurelhurst, Hawthorne Hills, Maple Leaf, and Crown Hill neighborhoods are all located on hills as well. Many of the hilliest areas are near the city center, with Capitol Hill, First Hill, and Beacon Hill collectively constituting something of a ridge along an isthmus between Elliott Bay and Lake Washington. The break in the ridge between First Hill and Beacon Hill is man-made, the result {{of two of the}} many <b>regrading</b> projects that reshaped the topography of the city center. The topography of the city center was also changed by the construction of a seawall and the artificial Harbor Island (completed 1909) {{at the mouth of the}} city's industrial Duwamish Waterway, the terminus of the Green River. The highest point within city limits is at High Point in West Seattle, which is roughly located near 35th Ave SW and SW Myrtle St. Other notable hills include Crown Hill, View Ridge/Wedgwood/Bryant, Maple Leaf, Phinney Ridge, Mt. Baker Ridge, and Highlands/Carkeek/Bitterlake.|$|E

25|$|From {{the time}} of his arrival in Seattle, Thomson had {{considered}} the hilly landscape and the extensive mudflats as obstacles to the city's growth. He launched several <b>regrading</b> projects, most notably the extensive Denny Regrade, but also the Jackson regrade (between Main and Judkins Streets and 4th and 12th Avenues) and the <b>regrading</b> of Dearborn Street, with the 12th Avenue Bridge (now Jose P. Rizal Bridge) spanning Dearborn and connecting First Hill to Beacon Hill. He also drove Westlake Avenue through from Downtown to Lake Union, the first flat route connecting the two. He also worked with railroad magnate James J. Hill to get the Great Northern Railway to bypass the already crowded waterfront with a 1906 railway tunnel under Downtown.|$|E

50|$|In 1949, Metropolitan Police superintendents were <b>regraded</b> {{to the new}} rank {{of chief}} superintendent, chief {{inspectors}} were <b>regraded</b> to superintendent, and sub-divisional inspectors and divisional detective inspectors were <b>regraded</b> to chief inspector (with those ranks being abolished).|$|R
50|$|The Denny <b>Regrade</b> {{project was}} {{the removal of}} Denny Hill, one of the proverbial seven hills of Seattle. It ran east from First Avenue between Pike Street and Denny Way. Hill and street were named after the Denny family, who were among the city's {{earliest}} white inhabitants. The First Avenue <b>regrade</b> was started in 1897 and completed on January 6, 1899. From 1902 to 1911, the hill was sluiced into Elliott Bay by pumping water from Lake Union using hydraulic mining techniques, {{in a series of}} <b>regrades</b> along Pike and Pine Streets, Second Avenue, and the massive Denny <b>Regrade</b> No. 1 which <b>regraded</b> everything remaining between Fifth Avenue and the waterfront. In 1929-30, Denny <b>Regrade</b> No. 2 removed the final pieces of the hill east of Fifth Avenue using steam shovels.|$|R
25|$|The line to Broadmeadows, the Whittlesea line to Reservoir, the Bendigo line to St Albans, and {{the inner}} {{sections}} of the Hurstbridge line were electrified in 1921. The Gippsland line to Dandenong and Frankston line were electrified in 1922, as was the inner section of the Ringwood line due to <b>regrading</b> works.|$|E
25|$|Since 1999, {{the line}} has been modernised and the {{overhead}} line equipment has been refurbished and renewed from Mark 1 / Mark 3A to UK1 range to allow an increase line speeds from 110mph to 125mph (with 140mph capability in areas previously fitted with Automatically Tensioned Mark 1 equipment - subject to upgrading of the balance weight arrangement to provide individually tensioned contact / catenary wires and <b>regrading</b> of the contact wires).|$|E
25|$|The {{area around}} Eugene Field Park has {{been subject to}} {{flooding}} over the years; floods struck the area in 2008 and 2013. As early as the 1930s, residents in Albany Park and nearby North Park requested help due to flooding. In 1940-41 a WPA project undertaken by the city attempted to alleviate flooding by dredging the riverbed, <b>regrading</b> the river banks and laying a V-shaped concrete channel in the river bed. The work extended from the North Shore Channel to the pedestrian bridge in Eugene Field Park.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the vision}} of city {{engineer}} R.H. Thompson, who had already {{played a key role}} in the development of municipal utilities, a massive effort was made to level the extreme hills that rose south and north of the bustling city. From 1900 to 1914 the Denny <b>Regrade</b> to the north and the Jackson <b>Regrade</b> to the south leveled more than 120 ft of Denny Hill and parts of First and Beacon Hills. The Denny <b>Regrade</b> continued in spurts until 1930. Dirt from the Jackson <b>Regrade</b> filled in the swampy tidelands that are now occupied by the SoDo neighborhood as well as Safeco Field and Qwest Field. A seawall containing dirt from the Denny <b>Regrade</b> created the current waterfront. More dirt from the Denny <b>Regrade</b> went to build the industrial Harbor Island at the mouth of the Duwamish River, south of Downtown.|$|R
50|$|Nobber were <b>regraded</b> {{from the}} S.F.C. after 11 {{years as a}} senior club, which {{included}} three semi-final appearances. Castletown were also <b>regraded</b> after 15 years in the top-flight.|$|R
50|$|The rank was {{discontinued}} in 1949, {{when it was}} <b>regraded</b> to {{detective chief}} inspector. In 1953, it was <b>regraded</b> again to detective superintendent grade I, and is thus equivalent to a modern detective superintendent.|$|R
25|$|Connecting the new Philadelphia Branch to {{the rest}} of the B system was a {{considerable}} engineering challenge. A new surface line across the center of town was politically impossible and prohibitively expensive. Building around the outskirts of town would have required massive <b>regrading</b> and bridging, as the terrain is extremely hilly and the line would cut across every watershed flowing into the harbor. As a temporary expedient, traffic was handled through Baltimore on carfloats, but it was clear that a direct connection would have to be built.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, Victorian Railways {{embarked}} on an £80 million program dubbed ‘Operation Phoenix’ to rebuild a network badly run down by years of Depression-era underinvestment and wartime overutilisation. This included a substantial upgrade (<b>regrading,</b> rerouting and electrification) of the Gippsland line servicing Victoria's substantial brown coal fields in the Latrobe Valley to allow for greatly increased traffic in briquettes for industrial use. A suitably powerful electric locomotive was sought for both express passenger and heavy freight use on the upgraded, electrified line.|$|E
25|$|Among his {{achievements}} were the railway route through Snoqualmie Pass, the Lake Washington Ship Canal, {{much of the}} paving of Seattle's roads and sidewalks, numerous bridges over rivers and valleys, and major improvements to Seattle's sewer system, as well as straightening and deepening the Duwamish River and developing the Cedar River watershed, now one of Seattle's major sources of drinking water. He was also responsible {{for much of the}} <b>regrading</b> of Seattle, taking down hills and filling in the mudflats, and {{played a major role in}} the creation of Seattle City Light (the public electric utility), the Port of Seattle, and the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks. Elsewhere, he consulted on projects such as the Rogue River Valley Irrigation Canal, water development for Bellingham, Washington, and power plants in Southeastern Alaska.|$|E
50|$|From 1933, every Metropolitan Police {{division}} had two {{chief inspector}}s: chief inspector (administration) and chief inspector (crime) (the latter also being a uniformed administrative officer and not replacing the divisional detective inspector). From 1949, sub-divisional inspectors and DDIs were <b>regraded</b> as chief inspectors and current chief inspectors were <b>regraded</b> as superintendents. From 1953, chief inspectors commanding sub-divisions and detective chief inspectors commanding divisional CIDs were <b>regraded</b> as superintendents grade I, other chief inspectors were <b>regraded</b> as superintendents grade II, and a redefined rank of chief inspector {{was created for}} senior inspectors. Since 1974, the Metropolitan Police has only had one rank of superintendent, {{in common with the}} rest of the country.|$|R

25|$|With the {{collapse}} of the redevelopment plan, Marshall Heights residents began to demand in August 1949 that the freeze on improvements be lifted. City officials refused, arguing that with half of all homes in the neighborhood facing condemnation for safety reasons, redevelopment was the only option. The city also argued that it would be too expensive to build water and sewer lines along the existing street plan, and that residents would be unable to afford the hookup and frontage fees. In September 1949, District engineers staked out sewer, water, and natural gas lines along two streets in Marshall Heights to demonstrate the difficulties in construction and prove how costly the effect would be to residents. From this example, the city claimed that laying water and sewer lines in Marshall Heights would cost $1.2 million more than in any other neighborhood, and said that razing all the homes in the area, realigning streets around hills, <b>regrading</b> streets, and filling in valleys was the only feasible and cost-effective option.|$|E
500|$|In March 2002, a six-year-long {{project to}} {{completely}} rebuild I-235 and the bridges which cross it began. The {{first two years}} consisted of rebuilding most of the bridges which cross it, starting with 42nd Street in West Des Moines. [...] The final four years of the project entailed finishing the remaining bridges, widening, <b>regrading,</b> and repaving {{the entire length of}} the highway.|$|E
500|$|St James' Church, Stretham, is an {{historic}} building protected by Acts of Parliament. Originally, {{the church was}} listed Grade A in a publicly available register on 5 February 1952 until a resurvey and <b>regrading</b> by the English Heritage on 19 August 1988. Since then, it is listed as a Grade II* building, which makes the church particularly important to the country's heritage and warrants every effort to preserve it. [...] The church records are kept in the County Records Office, Cambridge. Since 1990, StJames' Church has had an ecumenical agreement with the Stretham Methodists.|$|E

500|$|His company {{expanded}} into civil construction work during World War II. Using in-house manufactured equipment they scarified [...] of road {{so it was}} ready for <b>regrading.</b> The company's work did have some negative impacts on the town. When they had electricity installed their first welder drew so much power the town's supply had to be upgraded. This welder also put out sufficient radio-frequency interference to disrupt radio reception elsewhere the town; a matter that caused some complaint. They added vehicle sales and maintenance in the 1940s and expanded with {{the purchase of a}} one-acre lot opposite the original workshop in 1946. A significant part of the Shaw company's income from the late 1940s to the early 1950s was selling vehicle tires. The company continued to expand and a new workshop was opened in the town, with a ceremony in August 1953. In the same year the company became an agent for [...] "David Brown" [...] tractors, its first agency.|$|E

2500|$|Some of Thomson's {{projects}} remain controversial to this day. The Denny Regrade, his largest <b>regrading</b> project, sluiced away 6 {{million cubic}} yards (5,000,000 m³) {{of earth and}} numerous buildings, including the landmark Washington Hotel. Owners who didn't willingly sell were left with their buildings standing uselessly on pinnacles, the remaining land removed around them. The project {{was supposed to make}} way for a northward growth of downtown, but voters rejected Virgil Bogue's plan to rebuild the area in Beaux-Arts style in 1912, leaving the area to develop piecemeal. As late as the 1970s, the neighborhood was merely [...] "serviceable but seedy", then increasingly a center of Seattle's bohemian life, while also seeing a growth in condominium and office development.|$|E

50|$|Although {{in retrospect}} it is {{referred}} to as the Denny <b>Regrade</b> (and the name has become the name of a neighborhood), there were, in fact, several separate <b>regrades</b> of the former Denny Hill, beginning with private-sector efforts. Around 1900, property owners along relatively low-lying First Avenue took it upon themselves to cut through from Pike Street to Cedar Street. A similar cut (but initiated by the City) lowered Second Avenue in 1904; around the same time, the south part of the hill was shaved off as Pike and Pine Streets were <b>regraded</b> between Second and Fifth Avenues.|$|R
