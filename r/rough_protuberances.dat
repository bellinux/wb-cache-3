60|$|The {{little fellow}} {{had a great}} opinion of his own strength. So, {{grasping}} the <b>rough</b> <b>protuberances</b> of the rock, he tugged and toiled amain, and got himself quite out of breath, {{without being able to}} stir the heavy stone. It seemed to be rooted into the ground. No wonder he could not move it; for it would have taken all the force of a very strong man to lift it out of its earthy bed.|$|E
50|$|Subfossils of the Réunion ibis {{show that}} it was more robust, likely much heavier, and had a larger head than the African sacred and straw-necked ibises. It was {{nonetheless}} similar to them in most features. According to Hume, it would have been no longer than 65 cm (25 in) in length, the size of the African sacred ibis. <b>Rough</b> <b>protuberances</b> on the wing bones of the Réunion ibis {{are similar to those of}} birds that use their wings in combat. It was perhaps flightless, but this has not left significant osteological traces; no complete skeletons have been collected, but of the known pectoral elements, only one feature indicates reduction in flight capability. The coracoid is elongated and the radius and ulna are robust, as in flighted birds, but a particular foramen between a metacarpal and the alular is otherwise only known from flightless birds, such as some ratites, penguins, and several extinct species.|$|E
5|$|Viewed in deposit, such {{as with a}} spore print, {{the spores}} of Marasmius rotula appear white or pale yellow. Under an optical microscope, they are hyaline (translucent), teardrop- or pip-shaped, and have {{dimensions}} of 7–10 by 3–5µm. The basidia (spore-producing cells) are four-spored, club-shaped or nearly so, and 21–21 by 4–17µm. Along {{the edge of the}} gill, interspersed among the basidia, are non-reproductive cells, the cheilocystidia; these are club-shaped with <b>rough</b> wart-like <b>protuberances</b> on the surface. The gill edges further feature broom cells, which are variably shaped, thin-walled, and measure 7–32 by 2.5–20µm. Their apical surfaces are covered with yellowish, blunt, and conical warts or incrustations 0.2–1.5 by 0.1–1µm.|$|R
500|$|An average-sized centrosaurine, Achelousaurus {{was about}} [...] long, with a weight of about [...] As a ceratopsian, it walked on all fours, {{had a short}} tail and a large head with a hooked beak. It had a bony neck-frill {{at the rear of}} the skull, which sported a pair of long spikes, which curved towards the outside. Adult Achelousaurus had <b>rough</b> bosses (roundish <b>protuberances)</b> above the eyes and on the snout where other centrosaurines often had horns in the same positions. These bosses were covered by a thick layer of keratin, but their exact shape in life is uncertain. According to some {{scientists}} the bosses were used in fights, with the animals butting each other's heads, and for display.|$|R
40|$|Zirconium-based {{ferromagnetic}} sorbent was fabricated by coprecipitation of Fe 2 +/Fe 3 + salts in a zirconium {{solution and}} explored {{as a potential}} sorbent for removing the Cu 2 +, Zn 2 +, and Cd 2 + from aqueous solution. The sorbent could easily be separated from aqueous solution {{under the influence of}} external magnetic field due to the ferromagnetism property. A trimodal distribution was obtained for the sorbent with average particle size of 22. 74 [*]μm. The –OH functional groups played an important role for efficient removal of divalent ions. The surface of the sorbent was <b>rough</b> with abundant <b>protuberance</b> while the existence of divalent ions on the sorbent surface after the sorption process was demonstrated. Decontamination of the heavy metal ions was studied as a function of initial metal ions concentration and solution pH. Uptake of the heavy metal ions showed a pH-dependent profile with maximum sorption at around pH 5. The presence of the ferromagnetic sorbent in solution at different initial pH has shown a buffering effect. Equilibrium isotherms were analyzed using Langmuir, Freundlich, Dubinin-Radushkevich, and Temkin isotherm models. Adequacy of fit for the isotherm models based on evaluation of R 2 and ARE has revealed that heavy metal ions decontamination was fitted well with the Freundlich model...|$|R
40|$|The {{front and}} back {{surfaces}} of fully aromatic polyamide thin films isolated from reverse osmosis (RO) membranes were characterized by TEM, SEM and AFM. The front surfaces were relatively <b>rough</b> showing polyamide <b>protuberances</b> of different sizes and shapes; the back surfaces were all consistently smoother with very similar granular textures formed by polyamide nodules of 20 – 50 nm. Occasional pore openings of approximately {{the same size as}} the nodules were observed on the back surfaces. Because traditional microscopic imaging techniques provide limited information about the internal morphology of the thin films, TEM tomography was used to create detailed 3 D visualizations that allowed the examination of any section of the thin film volume. These tomograms confirmed the existence of numerous voids within the thin films and revealed structural characteristics that support the water permeance difference between brackish water (BWRO) and seawater (SWRO) RO membranes. Consistent with a higher water permeance, the thin film of the BWRO membrane ESPA 3 contained relatively more voids and thinner sections of polyamide than the SWRO membrane SWC 3. According to the tomograms, most voids originate near the back surface and many extend all the way to the front surface shaping the polyamide protuberances. Although it is possible for the internal voids to be connected to the outside through the pore openings on the back surface, it was verified that some of these voids comprise nanobubbles that are completely encapsulated by polyamide. TEM tomography is a powerful technique for investigating the internal nanostructure of polyamide thin films. A comprehensive knowledge of the nanostructural distribution of voids and polyamide sections within the thin film may lead to a better understanding of mass transport and rejection mechanisms in RO membranes...|$|R
