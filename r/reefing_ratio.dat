40|$|Normalizing {{drop test}} reefed drag area for {{suspension}} line length with data from Wolf allows best match of test results with Knacke <b>reefing</b> <b>ratio</b> curve. Various sizes and porosities of quarter spherical ribbon parachutes were tested. All appear to fit the published <b>reefing</b> <b>ratio</b> curve-quarter spherical parachutes match...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted at}} Mach 1. 80 in the Langley 4 -foot supersonic pressure tunnel {{to determine the effects}} of variation in <b>reefing</b> <b>ratio</b> and geometric porosity on the drag and stability characteristics of four basic canopy types deployed in the wake of a cone-cylinder forebody. The basic designs included cross, hemisflo, disk-gap-band, and extended-skirt canopies; however, modular cross and standard flat canopies and a ballute were also investigated. An empirical correlation was determined which provides a fair estimation of the drag coefficients in transonic and supersonic flow for parachutes of specified geometric porosity and <b>reefing</b> <b>ratio...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the parachutes {{that have been}} drop tested {{in support of the}} Ares I first stage deceleration system development. The results of the tests show that the <b>reefing</b> <b>ratios</b> for these quarter spherical ribbon parachutes provide the same reefed drag area as historical conical ribbon parachutes. Two sources are investigated for properly normalizing the parachutes relative to their suspension line length, and one is found to be superior. Nomenclature D = nominal diameter of the parachute Le = equivalent length of a suspension system I...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} results of a study of skirt reefing line tension for very low-porosity parachutes. In {{particular}} we show how much higher such tensions can be in comparison to that sustained by line-reefing the skirts of high-porosity canopies. Line tensions are calculated here for G- 12 and G- 11 canopies that were not only skirt-reefed, but also rigged for complete closure of their apex vent. Our derivations also yield interesting estimates of the worst possible line <b>reefing</b> tension <b>ratio</b> T/FD obtainable, namely 16. 2 % for long reefing lines and 22. 5 % for short ones. Finally, we present a simple approach for recasting line tensions, obtained via either calculations or wind tunnel measurements, in a way that takes into account the possible deceleration of parachute–payload systems...|$|R
40|$|Offshore reef systems {{consist of}} {{individual}} reefs, with spaces in between, which together constitute the reef matrix. This {{is the first}} comprehensive, large-scale study, {{of the influence of}} an offshore reef system on wave climate and wave transmission. The focus was on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, utilizing a 16 -yr record of wave height from seven satellite altimeters. Within the GBR matrix, the wave climate is not strongly dependent on reef matrix submergence. This suggests that after initial wave breaking at the seaward edge of the reef matrix, wave energy that penetrates the matrix has little depth modulation. There is no clear evidence to suggest that as <b>reef</b> matrix porosity (<b>ratio</b> of spaces between individual reefs to reef area) decreases, wave attenuation increases. This is because individual reefs cast a wave shadow much larger than the reef itself; thus, a matrix of isolated reefs is remarkably effective at attenuating wave energy. This weak dependence of transmitted wave energy on depth of reef submergence, and reef matrix porosity, is also evident in the lee of the GBR matrix. Here, wave conditions appear to be dependent largely on local wind speed, rather than wave conditions either seaward, or within the reef matrix. This is because the GBR matrix is a very effective wave absorber, irrespective of water depth and reef matrix porosity. 12 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{compositions}} of coexisting {{and individual}} cooperite (ideally PtS) and braggite (ideally (Pt,Pd) S) grains from the Merensky Reef of the Bushveld Complex, {{as well as}} cooperite, braggite and vysotskite (ideally PdS) grains from the UG- 2 of the Bushveld Complex were investigated. There is a clearly defined miscibility gap between cooperite and braggite, but no evident gap between braggite and vysotskite. Partition coefficients between cooperite and braggite are determined on coexisting phases. The gbD raggite/c~ 176 in atomic ratios {{are estimated to be}} 0. 54 for Pt, 15. 81 for Pd and 5. 93 for Ni. For Rh and Co the/~D ~ are estimated to be> 1. 40 and> 1. 46 respectively. No systematic behaviour is detected for Fe and Cu. Coupled substitutions of Pd + Ni for Pt in cooperite and braggite/vysotskite are indicated. Within the cooperite of the Merensky <b>Reef,</b> the Pd:Ni <b>ratio</b> is approximately 9 : 11. The substitution trend in braggite, which extends to vysotskite in the UG- 2, is dependent on the base-metal sulphide (BMS) association. If pentlandite is the dominant Ni-bearing BMS, the Pd:Ni ratio is about 7 : 3 in the Merensky Reef and in the UG- 2. Millerite as the dominant Ni-bearing BMS in the UG- 2 changes this ratio to 3 : 1. It is concluded that the Ni-content in braggite/vysotskite from BMS assemblages does not depend on the NiS activity, but rather on temperature of formation...|$|R
40|$|The pomacentrid fishes Chromis caeruleus (Cuvier) and Dascyllus aruanus (Linn.) coexist on ramose live corals without {{apparently}} displaying aggressive reactions. The {{population in}} a coral colony is of many size groups, an obvious result of continual s ettlement of postlarvae of fishes from plankton, probably a strategy in nature to prevent in breeding in resident fishes. The {{relationship between the}} total number of fishes residing on a coral and the upper surface area of the habitat (coral colony) can be expressed as : Y - 0. 2117 — 0. 000064 X, where Y is the number of fishes per unit area of the coral and X the upper surface area of the coral sampled; the correlation coefficient (r) being — 0. 486. The relationship between the fish biomass and the upper surface area of the habitat can be expressed as : Y = 0. 07888 - 0. 00005225 X, where Y is the wei^t of fish per unit area of the coral sampled and X is the upper surface area of the coral; the correlation coefficient (r) being — 0. 99. As indicated by these correlation coefficients, there exists a closer relationship (inverse) between the biomass of fish and the surface area of the microhabitat (live isolate coral) than between {{the total number of}} fish and the surface area at a time in a coexisting system of resident <b>reef</b> fishes. The <b>ratio</b> of the fish biomass and the upper surface area of the coral (an index of density of fish) is also found to vary in different samples, within a range of 380. 3 to 934. 25 cm' of the coral and a fish biomass of 22. 42 to 30. 87 gm weight of fish sampled. The total length of the fishes ranged from 7 mm to 40 mm in the samples. The ptesratt study also indicates that neither a numerical nor biomass consistency of fishes can be anticipated in a microhabitat over a prolonged time. Both these factors are ever changing as also the area of the living habitat viz. the live coral colony. This is due to the interplay of many natural and artificial factors, such as, continual recruitment of postlarvae, growth of fish at sites, migration and mortality of fishes as well as the partial death or growth of corals that cause a dwindling or expansion of living space for resident fishes. The above factors in nature control the density of fish population in a coral live isolate. The maximum carrying capacity of the habitat perhaps is never allowed to reach so that coexistence is made possible without the fishes displaying apparent agonistic reaction [...] However, the present data did not clearly indicate the maximum carrying capacity of unit area of Acropora corymbosa sampled; the systems analysed were in different stages of density level...|$|R
