It had a 4-cylinder engine and was water-cooled with sliding-gear transmission and D.W.F. ball bearings, 3-speeds forward and <b>reverse,</b> <b>shaft</b> drive, spark and throttle on sector within wheel and foot accelerator. It also had a 109 in wheelbase and a heavy nickel steel crankshaft.|$|E
5000|$|Deep shaft piercings are piercings which {{pass through}} the penile shaft. They are most {{commonly}} seen {{in the form of}} deeply placed ampallangs, apadravyas, and <b>reverse</b> <b>shaft</b> Prince Alberts. They are more rare piercings due to associated pain, difficulty, bleeding and long healing times. Common placement is directly behind the head of the penis, but they can be placed farther back.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a failure {{analysis of a}} <b>reverse</b> <b>shaft</b> in the transmission system of an all-terrain vehicle (ATV). The <b>reverse</b> <b>shaft</b> with splines fractured into two pieces during operation. Visual examination of the fractured surface clearly showed cracks initiated from the roots of spline teeth. To find out the cause of fracture of the shaft, a finite element analysis was carried out to pre-dict the stress state of the shaft under steady loading and shock loading, respectively. The steady loading was pro-duced under normal operation, while the shock loading could be generated by an abrupt change of operation such as start-up or sudden braking during working. Results of stress analysis reveal that the highest stressed area coin-cided with the fractured regions of the failed shaft. The maximum stress predicted under shock loading exceeded the yield strength and {{was believed to be}} the stimulant for crack initiation and propagation at this weak region. The failure analysis thus showed that the premature fatigue fracture of the shaft was caused by abnormal operation. Finally, some suggestions to enhance service durability of the transmission system of ATV are discussed...|$|E

50|$|Their {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} outside the plate frames. The Murdoch's D slide valves, mounted above the cylinders, were arranged at an incline and were actuated by Allan straight link motion. In {{this type of}} valve gear, the valve rod and the expansion link are respectively connected to opposing arms on the <b>reversing</b> <b>shaft,</b> so that partial rotation of the shaft moves the link and the die block in opposite directions.|$|R
50|$|They {{were built}} with Hendrieâ€™s steam reversers. The Hendrie steam {{reversing}} gear {{consisted of a}} 5+1/2 in diameter steam cylinder and a 5 in diameter oil cylinder, arranged in line on a bracket which was fixed to the main engine frame on the driver's side. The cylinders had a common piston rod which had a slot in the centre, between the cylinders. This slot accommodated a sliding crosshead which engaged with an arm fixed to the <b>reversing</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Walschaerts {{valve gear}} was {{controlled}} by a vertical type of steam reversing engine which {{was attached to the}} right-hand side of the boiler, just below the dome. It consisted of a 5+1/2 in diameter steam cylinder and a 4 in diameter oil cylinder, fitted with a common piston rod with a crosshead which was machined integral with the piston rod. This crosshead was connected to a lever fitted to the <b>reversing</b> <b>shaft.</b> After 1912, these reversing engines were replaced with Hendrie steam reversers.|$|R
2500|$|The Mason Bogie was still, though, {{plagued by}} one of the biggest {{problems}} of the Fairlie - the jointed steam pipes to the driven truck leaked far too much steam. Mason eventually changed to a different scheme, in which the pivot point for the leading truck became a hollow ball joint through which the live steam for the cylinders passed. [...] Mason also developed a sliding seal for the exhaust from the moving cylinder saddle into the smoke box. Although better, Mason's improvements took up much valuable space in between the driving wheels, forcing Mason to use an outside valve gear, generally the Walschaerts valve gear. Additionally, the <b>reversing</b> <b>shaft</b> had to be mounted atop the boiler, with a long lifting link dropping down to the radius rod, a feature unique to Mason Bogies (this was necessary because the lifting link would swing to the side as the truck pivoted, lifting the radius rod and changing the valve setting. [...] Lengthening the link, and thus increasing the radius of its swing, minimized the amount of change.).|$|R
2500|$|The {{vertical}} {{position of the}} radius bar is controlled in the cab by the driver adjusting the reverser which in turn controls the mechanical linkage; reach rod (3), lifting link (4), [...] lifting arm (5) and <b>reverse</b> arm and <b>shaft</b> (6).|$|R
50|$|The gearbox was {{centrally}} {{controlled by}} a lever in the facia providing three forward speeds and <b>reverse</b> The propeller <b>shafts</b> from the differential to each wheel had flexible fabric joints and enclosed universal joints.

25|$|The Maybach {{system is}} {{essentially}} a simplified version of the double differential, or more accurately in mechanical terms, a double controlled differential. It replaces the double differential's forward and <b>reverse</b> steering <b>shaft</b> and clutch system with a single shaft that spins in one direction, and brakes on the idlers. Like the controlled differential, the brakes are normally applied to keep the idlers fixed. The steering inputs release {{one or the other}} brake to cause the idler to spin and that track to slow. Unlike the full double differential, the other side is not sped up so the system is not fully regenerative, and since both idler sets spin in the same direction, it does not offer neutral steering.|$|R
50|$|The TRS 18 was {{originally}} designed for self-launching motor gliders but was adapted to power conventional ultralight aircraft and unmanned vehicles (RPV). It {{was originally}} designed and developed by Sermel, a competitor company to Microturbo which the latter {{took over in}} 1971. It is a simple, low thrust, <b>reverse</b> flow single <b>shaft</b> engine with a centrifugal compressor and axial turbine. It is built in three modules: an intake section containing starter and lubrication systems; a centre section with compressor and turbine on ball bearings; and an aft section with the folded combustion chambers and tail-pipe.|$|R
50|$|The main {{products}} today are the heavy duty Ural sidecar motorcycles with two-wheel-drive designed for rough, rugged terrain, and cT model for urban commuting and paved road touring. There are many places in Russia where poor roads, or {{a lack of}} roads, makes horses and URAL motorcycles necessary to transport gear. URAL motorcycles have four-stroke, (as of 2014) fuel injected air-cooled, flat-twin engines, a four speed gear box with <b>reverse</b> gear, <b>shaft</b> drive, two disc dry clutch, spring shock absorbers, and (as of 2014) disc brakes on all three wheels. The company has developed an engine that meets the standards required by the modern sporting and leisure rider. Though the outward appearance of the engine is the same as before, new quality control techniques employ better alloying and casting, better engineering tolerances, and better paint, powder coating and stainless steel exhausts while retaining the advantage of continuity with the inherently balanced design of a horizontally-opposed flat twin engine with roller bearings in a solid frame.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} six {{case histories}} of load tests on reverse circulation method installed drilled shafts, {{with or without}} tip grouting, under axial load. Shaft displacement readings based on both telltale/extensometer and rebar gage are compared first. Subsequently, effect of loading cycle on shaft elastic modulus estimation is evaluated. The load versus displacement relationships at shaft head, the t-z curves of clay layer and of gravel layer are other important concerns and are compared in the paper. In addi-tion, the adhesion factor Î± and the parameter Î² based on the pile load test results are suggested in the paper.

40|$|A {{cryogenic}} cam {{butterfly valve}} has {{a body that}} includes an axially extending fluid conduit formed there through. A disc lug is connected to a back side of a valve disc and has a circular bore that receives and is larger than a cam of a cam shaft. The valve disc is rotatable for a quarter turn within the body about a lug axis that is offset from the shaft axis. Actuating the cam shaft in the closing rotational direction first causes the camming side of the cam of the cam shaft to rotate the disc lug and the valve disc a quarter turn from the open position to the closed position. Further actuating causes the camming side of the cam shaft to translate the valve disc into sealed contact with the valve seat. Opening rotational direction of the cam <b>shaft</b> <b>reverses</b> these motions...|$|R
50|$|The 4-cylinder engine had a {{slightly}} larger cylinder bore than the superseded 25-30, giving an RAC rating of 36.3 hp from 5842 cc (32.8 hp, 5278 cc). It took 25-30's {{place in the}} catalogue. The engine's crankshaft runs in no fewer than five bearings. Power was transmitted to the live rear axle through a multiple-disc clutch with phosphor bronze and steel friction surfaces and a gearbox with sliding spur-wheel gears, providing four forward speeds and <b>reverse,</b> using a <b>shaft</b> fitted with two universal joints. The gearbox, of unusually strong design including an extra bearing on the inner end of the engine driven shaft, is operated on the gate principle. Unusually by 1907 the engine was fitted with a governor mounted on the fan spindle operating on the car's throttle. The Krebs carburettor initially fitted was replaced by an Austin design. Cooling water was circulated by a centrifugal pump, oil by a skew-gear driven vane-pump. An oil pressure gauge is fitted.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} and development on directâ€“drive motor technology and on their control system push forwardthe application of these devices as electric cams in a large numbers of industrial applications, such as examplemotion control system for packaging machineries. Performances of these devices are much higher than themechanical solutions for machine motion, in terms of precision and operational speed, and, of course, intime required to reconfigure the motion profile. However, classical approaches to the ball bearing diagnosis that use analysis of vibration signals are notlonger applicable, {{as they have been}} developed on the hypothesis of drive constant speed. In fact, in mostof the current industrial application, the control system drives the motor to follow a complex and cyclic (i. e. motor <b>shaft</b> <b>reverses</b> its motion direction at each operational cycle) non constant speed motion profile. In those application, even Computed Order Tracking [1] (COT), which is the main fault bearing diagnosistechnique used in non-constant velocity applications, fails to detect incipient faults, as highlighted by Fyfeand Munck in [2]. This paper presents a new procedure that modifies the COT to be successfully applicable to the diagnosisproblem of ball bearings in variable speed motion applications...|$|R
