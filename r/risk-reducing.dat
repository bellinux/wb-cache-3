50|$|Agricultural sector {{companies}} {{most often}} view investment in land {{as an opportunity}} to leverage their significant monetary resources and market access to take advantage of underused land, diversify their holdings, and vertically integrate their production systems. The World Bank identifies three areas in which multinational companies can leverage economies of scale: access to cheap international rather than domestic financial markets, <b>risk-reducing</b> diversification of holdings, and greater ability to address infrastructural roadblocks. In the past few decades, multinationals have shied away from direct involvement in relatively unprofitable primary production, instead focusing on inputs and processing and distribution. When the food price crisis hit, risk was transferred from primary production to the price-sensitive processing and distribution fields, and returns became concentrated in primary production. This has incentivized agribusinesses to vertically integrate to reduce supplier risk that has been heightened by the ongoing food price volatility. These companies hold mixed attitudes towards food imports and exports: While some concentrate on food exports, others focus on domestic markets first.|$|E

The proposed plan of the British Columbia Ovarian Cancer Research Group program, involved performing opportunistic salpingectomy with benign hysterectomy or in lieu of bilateral tubal ligation for permanent contraception. It is suggested that this approach would yield a 20-40 percent population risk reduction for ovarian cancer over the next 20 years.

Significant health hazards can result from using water loaded with pathogens in this way, especially if people eat raw vegetables that have been irrigated with the polluted water.

40|$|Introduction and Aims: For {{women who}} carry BRCA mutations, <b>risk-reducing</b> {{surgeries}} are {{an option to}} decrease breast and ovarian cancer risk. This study aims to determine the uptake, time course, and predictors of <b>risk-reducing</b> mastectomy (RRM) and <b>risk-reducing</b> salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) in BRCA carriers. Results: In 272 female carriers, followed for a median of 3. 7 years, 23 % of those eligible chose RRM, and 51 % percent chose RRSO. Among BRCA carriers who chose these procedures, median time to both RRM and RRSO was approximately 4 months after learning of BRCA-positive results. Predictors of RRM were as follows: age below 60 years (hazard ratio 1. 8, p[*]=[*] 0. 04), prior breast cancer (hazard ratio 2. 4, p[*]=[*] 0. 0004), and RRSO (hazard ratio 7. 2, p[*]<[*] 0. 0001). Predictors of RRSO were as follows: age below 60 years (hazard ratio 3. 6, p[*]=[*] 0. 006), prior breast cancer (hazard ratio 1. 8, p[*]=[*] 0. 002), and RRM (hazard ratio 5. 4, p[*]<[*] 0. 0001). Conclusions: Many women who undergo BRCA testing use these results to make clinical decisions; those who choose <b>risk-reducing</b> surgeries typically do so within months of receiving BRCA-positive results.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} {{the prevalence of}} the use of cancer <b>risk-reducing</b> measures among Australian BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 mutation carriers. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective follow-up of female carriers of BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 mutations who had no personal history of cancer and were enrolled in a multiple-case breast cancer family cohort study (kConFab). Data, including cancer events and uptake of <b>risk-reducing</b> surgery and medication were collected by self-report at cohort entry and 3 yearly thereafter. Surgery was confirmed from pathology and medical records. Women were followed up from enrolment until cancer diagnosis, date of last follow-up, or death.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} BRCA 1 / 2 mutation carriers' cumulative {{ovarian cancer}} risks after <b>risk-reducing</b> salpingectomy at various ages with delayed oophorectomy {{several years later}} compared with <b>risk-reducing</b> salpingo-oophorectomy. METHODS: A literature search was performed on cumulative ovarian cancer risks and effects of <b>risk-reducing</b> salpingo-oophorectomy and salpingectomy. Results were used in a modeling study to estimate cumulative ovarian cancer risks for various scenarios of salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy and <b>risk-reducing</b> salpingo-oophorectomy using Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Estimated cumulative ovarian cancer risks at age 70 years for <b>risk-reducing</b> salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy are highest for BRCA 1 mutation carriers undergoing surgeries at higher age. Maximum increase in point estimates (from 1. 8 % to 4. 1 %) occurs in 40 -year-old BRCA 1 mutation carriers undergoing oophorectomy at age 45 years after nonprotective salpingectomy instead of salpingo-oophorectomy at age 40 years. In the best-case scenario, assuming 65 % risk reduction by salpingectomy and 96 % by salpingo-oophorectomy, point estimates increase (from 1. 8 % to 2. 6 %) or decrease (from 3. 4 % to 3. 3 %) depending on age. In the worst-case scenario for BRCA 2, point estimates maximally increase from 0. 6 % to 1. 8 % in 45 -year-old carriers when oophorectomy is performed at age 50 years instead of <b>risk-reducing</b> salpingo-oophorectomy at age 45 years. In the best-case scenario, point estimates increase (from 1. 3 % to 1. 5 %) or decrease (from 1. 5 to 1. 3 %).

The remit of this multidisciplinary clinic, staffed by individuals in both oncology and genetics, is to provide individualised screening recommendations, support in decision-making, <b>risk-reducing</b> strategies, cascade testing, and an extensive research portfolio. METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed to evaluate uptake of genetic testing, <b>risk-reducing</b> surgery and cancer prevalence in 346 families seen between January 1996 and December 2006. RESULTS 661 individuals attended the clinic and 406 mutation carriers were identified; 85. 8 % mutation carriers have chosen to attend for annual follow-up. 70 % of mutation carriers elected for <b>risk-reducing</b> bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRBSO). 32 % of unaffected women chose <b>risk-reducing</b> bilateral mastectomy; 32 % of women with breast cancer chose contralateral <b>risk-reducing</b> mastectomy at time of diagnosis. Some women took over eight years to decide to have surgery. 91 % of individuals approached {{agreed to participate in}} research programmes. INTERPRETATION A novel specialist clinic for mutation carriers has been successfully established. The number of mutation positive families is increasing. This and high demand for RRBSO in women over 40 is inevitably going to place an increasing demand on existing health resources. Our clinic model has subsequently been adopted in other centres and this will greatly facilitate translational studies and provide a healthcare structure for management and follow up of such people who are at a high cancer risk...|$|E
40|$|<b>Risk-{{reducing}}</b> salpingo-oophorectomy {{for reducing}} future cancer risk {{in women with}} hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome is rarely performed in Japan; therefore, the cancer pre-ventive effect of <b>risk-reducing</b> salpingo-oophorectomy for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome among the Japanese population remains unclear. Here, we report the first case of serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma identified through a <b>risk-reducing</b> salpingo-oophorectomy in a Japanese woman with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome and who had a dele-terious germline mutation of E 1214 X in BRCA 1, but not a BRCA 2 mutation. A pre-operative examination revealed multiple uterine leiomyomas but no adnexal mass. Robotic-assisted bilat-eral salpingo-oophorectomy together with hysterectomy was performed. A pathological examin-ation identified serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma in the right fallopian tube with no dissemination. Serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma is implicated as an origin of invasive cancer of the fallopian tube with peritoneal dissemination; prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy is currently the only method to identify this occult cancer. Our case demonstrated that <b>risk-reducing</b> salpingo-oophorectomy can detect occult cancers, including serous tubal intraepithe-lial carcinoma, thereby preventing future cancer development in the Japanese hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome population. Key words: BRCA 1 – hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome – fallopian tube neoplasm – genetic counselin...|$|E
40|$|We {{would like}} to present a patient with a {{classical}} phenotype of a rare disorder - Cowden syndrome, its diagnostics and management challenges. A breast surgeon has {{to be aware of}} this rare condition when treating a patient with breast manifestations of Cowden syndrome and has to refer the patient to a clinical geneticist for further evaluation. Sequencing of the PTEN gene showed the Asp 24 Gly mutation. According to the latest literature data, the lifetime risk of breast cancer for Cowden syndrome patients is 81 % and surgery is a justified option {{to reduce the risk of}} breast cancer. Bilateral <b>risk-reducing</b> mastectomy with immediate reconstruction was performed to eliminate further risk of breast cancer. 3 years after the <b>risk-reducing</b> breast surgery the patient is satisfied with the outcome. This is to our best knowledge the first reported Cowden syndrome case with follow-up data after <b>risk-reducing</b> measures have been taken...|$|E
