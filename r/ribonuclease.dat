5|$|The {{difficulty}} in purifying proteins {{in large quantities}} made them very difficult for early protein biochemists to study. Hence, early studies focused on proteins that could be purified in large quantities, e.g., those of blood, egg white, various toxins, and digestive/metabolic enzymes obtained from slaughterhouses. In the 1950s, the Armour Hot Dog Co. purified 1 kg of pure bovine pancreatic <b>ribonuclease</b> A and made it freely available to scientists; this gesture helped <b>ribonuclease</b> A become a major target for biochemical study for the following decades.|$|E
5|$|As stated above, the exosome complex {{contains}} many proteins with <b>ribonuclease</b> domains. The {{exact nature of}} these <b>ribonuclease</b> domains has changed across evolution from bacterial to archaeal to eukaryotic complexes as various activities have been gained and lost. The exosome is primarily a 3'-5' exoribonuclease, meaning that it degrades RNA molecules from their 3' end. Exoribonucleases contained in exosome complexes are either phosphorolytic (the RNase PH-like proteins) or, in eukaryotes, hydrolytic (the RNase R and RNase D domain proteins). The phosphorolytic enzymes use inorganic phosphate to cleave the phosphodiester bonds - releasing nucleotide diphosphates. The hydrolytic enzymes use water to hydrolyse these bonds - releasing nucleotide monophosphates.|$|E
5|$|After HIV has {{bound to}} the target cell, the HIV RNA and various enzymes, {{including}} reverse transcriptase, integrase, <b>ribonuclease,</b> and protease, are injected into the cell.

40|$|AbstractSeveral <b>ribonucleases</b> of the RNase A family {{function}} as antibacterial, anti-parasitic, and anti-viral agents. In this work, {{we have shown}} that mRNAs encoding {{five of the six}} known human <b>ribonucleases</b> of the RNase A family are expressed in cultured human monocytes, and that <b>ribonucleases</b> are released by adherent monocytes in culture. Using a polyclonal antiserum prepared against recombinant protein, we have detected one of these <b>ribonucleases,</b> RNase 4, in lysates of normal human peripheral blood monocytes, but not granulocytes or lymphocytes, by Western blotting. Subcellular localization by immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated the presence of RNase 4 in the cytoplasmic granules of isolated monocytes. Interestingly, mRNA encoding RNase 4 could not be detected in freshly isolated monocytes, emerging only after 16 h in culture, suggesting the possibility of de novo protein synthesis in association with monocyte differentiation...|$|R

5|$|Another {{chemical}} {{of interest}} found in P.indusiatus is hydroxymethylfurfural, which has attracted attention as a tyrosinase inhibitor. Tyrosinase catalyzes the initial steps of melanogenesis in mammals, and {{is responsible for}} the undesirable browning reactions in damaged fruits during post-harvest handling and processing, and its inhibitors are of interest to the medical, cosmetics, and food industries. Hydroxymethylfurfural, which occurs naturally in several foods, is not associated with serious health risks. P.indusiatus also contains a unique <b>ribonuclease</b> (an enzyme that cuts RNA into smaller components) possessing several biochemical characteristics that differentiate it from other known mushroom ribonucleases.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{different}} in structure from other retroviruses. It is roughly spherical with a diameter of about 120nm, around 60times smaller than a red blood cell. It is composed of two copies of positive single-stranded RNA that codes for the virus's nine genes enclosed by a conical capsid composed of 2,000 copies of the viral protein p24. The single-stranded RNA is tightly bound to nucleocapsid proteins, p7, and enzymes needed {{for the development of}} the virion such as reverse transcriptase, proteases, <b>ribonuclease</b> and integrase. A matrix composed of the viral protein p17 surrounds the capsid ensuring the integrity of the virion particle.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{also occur}} {{naturally}} and {{are involved in}} the regulation of metabolism. For example, enzymes in a metabolic pathway can be inhibited by downstream products. This type of negative feedback slows the production line when products begin to build up and is an important way to maintain homeostasis in a cell. Other cellular enzyme inhibitors are proteins that specifically bind to and inhibit an enzyme target. This can help control enzymes that may be damaging to a cell, like proteases or nucleases. A well-characterised example of this is the <b>ribonuclease</b> inhibitor, which binds to ribonucleases in one of the tightest known protein–protein interactions. Natural enzyme inhibitors can also be poisons and are used as defences against predators or as ways of killing prey.|$|E
40|$|The exocrine {{pancreatic}} <b>ribonucleases</b> form a {{group of}} relatively rapidly evolving proteins.

30|$|<b>Ribonucleases</b> {{are capable}} of {{offering}} protective measures to various organisms due to their host defense mechanisms (Wong et al. [2010]). <b>Ribonucleases</b> isolated from roots of Panax ginseng (Chinese ginseng), P. notoginseng (sanchi ginseng), and P. quinquefolius (American ginseng) have antifungal properties (Wang and Ng. [2000]). RNases of both Chinese and American ginseng are homodimeric and demonstrate HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity (Wang and Ng, [2000]).|$|R
50|$|The {{affinity}} of RI for <b>ribonucleases</b> {{is among}} the highest for any protein-protein interaction; the dissociation constant of the RI-RNase A complex is in the femtomolar (fM) range under physiological conditions while that for the RI-angiogenin complex is less than 1 fM. Despite this high affinity, RI is able to bind {{a wide variety of}} RNases A despite their relatively low sequence identity. Both biochemical studies and crystallographic structures of RI-RNase A complexes suggest that the interaction is governed largely by electrostatic interactions, but also involves substantial buried surface area. RI's affinity for <b>ribonucleases</b> is important, since many <b>ribonucleases</b> have cytotoxic and cytostatic effects that correlate well with ability to bind RI.|$|R
5|$|In animals, poly(A) <b>ribonuclease</b> (PARN) {{can bind to}} the 5' cap {{and remove}} {{nucleotides}} from the poly(A) tail. The level {{of access to the}} 5' cap and poly(A) tail is important in controlling how soon the mRNA is degraded. PARN deadenylates less if the RNA is bound by the initiation factors 4E (at the 5' cap) and 4G (at the poly(A) tail), which is why translation reduces deadenylation. The rate of deadenylation may also be regulated by RNA-binding proteins. Once the poly(A) tail is removed, the decapping complex removes the 5' cap, leading to a degradation of the RNA. Several other enzymes that seem to be involved in deadenylation have been identified in yeast.|$|E
5|$|In archaea, the Rrp41 subunit of {{the complex}} is a phosphorolytic exoribonuclease. Three copies of this protein {{are present in the}} ring and are {{responsible}} for the activity {{of the complex}}. In eukaryotes, none of the RNase PH subunits have retained this catalytic activity, meaning the core ring structure of the human exosome has no enzymatically active protein. Despite this loss of catalytic activity, the structure of the core exosome is highly conserved from archea to humans, suggesting that the complex performs a vital cellular function. In eukaryotes, the absence of the phosphorolytic activity is compensated by the presence of the hydrolytic enzymes, which are responsible for the <b>ribonuclease</b> activity of the exosome in such organisms.|$|E
5|$|Physiological enzyme {{inhibition}} {{can also be}} produced by specific protein inhibitors. This mechanism occurs in the pancreas, which synthesises many digestive precursor enzymes known as zymogens. Many of these are activated by the trypsin protease, so {{it is important to}} inhibit the activity of trypsin in the pancreas to prevent the organ from digesting itself. One way in which the activity of trypsin is controlled is the production of a specific and potent trypsin inhibitor protein in the pancreas. This inhibitor binds tightly to trypsin, preventing the trypsin activity that would otherwise be detrimental to the organ. Although the trypsin inhibitor is a protein, it avoids being hydrolysed as a substrate by the protease by excluding water from trypsin's active site and destabilising the transition state. Other examples of physiological enzyme inhibitor proteins include the barstar inhibitor of the bacterial <b>ribonuclease</b> barnase and the inhibitors of protein phosphatases.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Eosinophils remain {{among the}} most enigmatic of cells, as our {{appreciation}} of their detrimental activities—e. g., asthma and allergic disease—far outweighs our understanding of their beneficial effects. Among the major secretory ef-fector proteins of eosinophils are the <b>ribonucleases</b> eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) and eosino-phil cationic protein (ECP) in primates and their orthologs, the eosinophil-associated <b>ribonucleases</b> (EARs) in rodents. The rapid diversification ob-served among these <b>ribonucleases</b> suggested that the ultimate target(s) might be similarly efficient at generating sequence diversity while maintaining an unalterable susceptibility to ribonucleolytic cleav-age. This has prompted us to consider a role for these proteins and by extension, for eosinophils, in host defense against single-stranded RNA virus pathogens. We detail our studies of the antiviral activity of eosinophils and eosinophil <b>ribonucleases</b> against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in vitro and the related, natural rodent pathogen, pneumo-nia virus of mice (PVM), in vivo, and {{consider the possibility that}} antiviral host defense and the dys-regulated responses leading to asthma represent opposing sides of an eosinophil-mediated double-edged sword.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} viral capsid enters the cell, an enzyme called reverse {{transcriptase}} liberates the single-stranded (+)RNA genome from the attached viral proteins and copies {{it into a}} complementary DNA (cDNA) molecule. The process of reverse transcription is extremely error-prone, and the resulting mutations may cause drug resistance or allow the virus to evade the body's immune system. The reverse transcriptase also has <b>ribonuclease</b> activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that creates a sense DNA from the antisense cDNA. Together, the cDNA and its complement form a double-stranded viral DNA that is then transported into the cell nucleus. The integration of the viral DNA into the host cell's genome is carried out by another viral enzyme called integrase.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} {{described}} as new to science in 1774 by Jacob Christian Schaeffer. Its distribution encompasses Asia, North Africa, Europe, and Central America. Its presence in North America has not been clarified, due to confusion with the similar species Russula parvovirescens and R.crustosa. R.virescens fruits singly or scattered {{on the ground in}} both deciduous and mixed forests, forming mycorrhizal associations with broadleaf trees such as oak, European beech, and aspen. In Asia, it associates with several species of tropical lowland rainforest trees of the family Dipterocarpaceae. R.virescens has a <b>ribonuclease</b> enzyme with a biochemistry unique among edible mushrooms. It also has biologically active polysaccharides, and a laccase enzyme that can break down several dyes used in the laboratory and in the textile industry.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} members of the genus, these leaf blades are densely covered by peduncular (stalked) {{mucilaginous}} glands and sessile (flat) digestive glands. The peduncular glands consist of a few secretory cells on top of a single-celled stalk. These cells produce a mucilaginous secretion which forms visible droplets across the leaf surface. This wet appearance probably helps lure prey in search of water; a similar phenomenon is observed in the sundews. The droplets secrete only limited enzymes and serve mainly to entrap insects. On contact with an insect, the peduncular glands release additional mucilage from special reservoir cells located at the base of their stalks. The insect struggles, triggering more glands and encasing itself in mucilage. P. moranensis can bend its leaf edges slightly by thigmotropism, bringing additional glands into contact with the trapped insect. The sessile glands, which lie flat on the leaf surface, serve to digest the insect prey. Once the prey is entrapped by the peduncular glands and digestion begins, the initial flow of nitrogen triggers enzyme release by the sessile glands. These enzymes, which include amylase, esterase, phosphatase, protease, and <b>ribonuclease</b> break down the digestible components of the insect body. These fluids are then absorbed back into the leaf surface through cuticular holes, leaving only the chitin exoskeleton of the larger insects on the leaf surface.|$|E
50|$|These two <b>ribonucleases</b> {{are most}} likely {{evolutionarily}} related through a common ancestor, since they have common protein subunits and can be folded into very similar secondary structures. There are many conserved regions in these two <b>ribonucleases.</b> Sequences of the CR-I, CR-V, and CR-IV genes in domain 1 of the P4 helical region are conserved, with the consensus sequence in CR-IV being AGNNNNA for RNAse P and AGNNA for RNase MRP. CR-II and CR-III are also conserved in domain 2 of P RNA. The P3 helix is also conserved in both <b>ribonucleases</b> in all eukaryotes, but the function of this helix is not yet clear. These conserved regions are evidence of the close phylogenetic relation between these two important ribonucleoprotein complexes.|$|R
50|$|Artificial <b>ribonucleases</b> {{that act}} as {{restriction}} enzymes for RNA are also being developed. A PNA-based system, called PNAzymes, has a Cu(II)-2,9-dimethylphenanthroline group that mimics <b>ribonucleases</b> for specific RNA sequence and cleaves at a non-base-paired region (RNA bulge) of the targeted RNA formed when the enzyme binds the RNA.
