Firing automatic weapons, the terrorists killed Moro's bodyguards, (two Carabinieri in Moro's car and three policemen in the following car) and kidnapped him.|$|E
25|$|On 2 April 1978, Prodi {{and other}} {{teachers}} at the University of Bologna passed on a tip-off that revealed the whereabouts of the safe house where the kidnapped Aldo Moro, the former Prime Minister, was being held captive by the <b>Red</b> <b>Brigades.</b> Prodi claimed {{he had been given}} this tip-off by the founders of the Christian Democracy party, contacted from beyond the grave via a séance and a Ouija board. Whilst during this supposed séance Prodi thought the word Gradoli referred to a town on the outskirts of Rome, it probably referred to the Roman address of a <b>Red</b> <b>Brigades</b> safe house, located at no. 96, Via Gradoli.|$|E

60|$|It {{was still}} night. The full moon, shining with {{tropical}} brilliancy in a cloudless sky, vaguely revealed the rolling plains {{of sand and}} the huge moving mass of the army. As {{long as it was}} dark the battalions were closely formed in quarter columns. But presently the warmer, yellower light of dawn began to grow across the river and through the palms, and gradually, as the sun rose and it became daylight, the dense formation of the army was extended to an array more than two miles long. On the left, nearest the river, marched Lewis's brigade--three battalions in line and the fourth in column as a reserve. Next in order Maxwell's three battalions prolonged the line. The artillery were in the centre, supported by the North Staffordshire Regiment. The gunners of the Maxim battery had donned their tunics, so that the lines and columns of yellow and brown were relieved by a vivid flash of British <b>red.</b> MacDonald's <b>brigade</b> was on the right. David's brigade followed in rear of the centre as a reserve. The cavalry, the Camel Corps, and the Horse Artillery watched the right flank; and on the left the gunboats steamed along the river.|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} decades {{there has been a}} lot of {{attention}} to issues of safety, emergency response and crisis management. Emergency response rooms (ERRs) are interesting public sector organizational arrangements in this respect. In our paper we pay attention to emergency response rooms in the Netherlands and especially in Amsterdam. Using an ethnographic approach, we studied the fire <b>brigades</b> (<b>red),</b> the medical services (white) and the police (blue) including their back-office organizations, their habits, and the systems in-use. As could be predicted, the (technical) integration of ERR systems in the Netherlands was not unproblematic. In our contribution we will make clear that the organization of the safety response in Amsterdam is rather fragmented. The latest discussion in the field is about the introduction of net-centric work, a concept based upon the interactive internet 2. 0. Yet, it is not so much the technology, as well as the institutional arrangements that are at stake...|$|R
50|$|The {{statue of}} the White Army {{commander}} C. G. E. Mannerheim stands at the site where he was observing the battle. The countroversal statue was first suggested to the Koskipuisto park in 1939 but was finally erected on a hill eight kilometres from Tampere in 1956. Due to its remote location, the statue has often been vandalized during the years by local anarchists and other left-wing radicals. Vapaudenpatsas (The Statue of Liberty), by the sculptor Viktor Jansson, is another statue commemorating the White conquest of Tampere. It {{was placed in the}} Hämeenpuisto Park in 1921. The model of the figure was the far-right priest Elias Simojoki. The statue is holding a sword pointed towards the Tampere Workers' Hall {{on the other side of}} the park. The statue is often called Rummin-Jussi, after the nickname of the infamous White executioner Johannes From, responsible of murdering more than 70 <b>Reds.</b> The Swedish <b>Brigade</b> commemorative plaque is placed near the Kalevankangas Cemetery. It is a work of the sculptor Gunnar Finne.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{the brigade}} {{occasionally}} fought the Germans, it avoided confrontations with the occupier and stressed a [...] "clearing of the Polish territories of <b>red</b> banditry". The <b>brigade's</b> major success was its defeat {{of a joint}} Armia Ludowa and Soviet partisans force in a battle fought on 8 September 1944 near Rząbiec. The battle took place after a patrol of the brigade was captured by the communist formations, and its members tortured and slated for summary execution. One of the captured prisoners managed to escape and alerted the brigade to the situation. The brigade attacked and defeated the AL and Soviet soldiers. The Soviet captives were executed and several Poles of the AL who were accused of banditry as well. Thirteen of the captured Polish communists joined the brigade. In individual actions units of the brigade killed several hundred members and sympathizers of the PPR and the AL, in what one historian, Rafał Wnuk, described as a bloody and brutal civil war fought between communists and nationalists in the Kielce province.|$|R
50|$|During the Jacobite War the {{regiment}} went to France in April 1690 {{as part of}} Lord Mountcashel's brigade, in exchange for some French regiments amounting to 6,000 troops. After the Treaty of Limerick in 1691, {{the regiment}} remained {{in the service of}} the kings of France under its present name. It was next commanded in France by Theobald's younger son, Colonel Arthur Dillon, until 1733. Colonel James Dillon was KIA leading his regiment at the battle of Fontenoy in 1745 while his brother, Colonel Edward Dillon was killed at the Battle of Lauffelt two years later. The formation continued to recruit from the Wild Geese Irish exile community. By 1757, its uniform was the Irish <b>Brigade's</b> <b>red</b> coats (a carry over from its Jacobite origins), with the black facings indicating the regiment. A member of the Dillon family remained hereditary colonel-proprietor of the regiment up to 1747. Three caretaker commanders led the regiment until the last Dillon commander was old enough to take over in August 1767, as Louis XV wanted to maintain the link with the family which had given so much service.|$|R

25|$|On April 2 Romano Prodi, Mario Baldassarri, and Alberto Clò, of {{the faculty}} of the University of Bologna, passed on a tip about a safe-house where the <b>Red</b> <b>Brigades</b> might have been holding Moro.

25|$|Cossiga served also as {{minister}} for several times, notably during his stay as Italian Minister of the Interior, where he re-structured the Italian police, civil protection and secret services.

Cossiga was Prime Minister when neo-fascist terrorists bombed Bologna railway station in 1980.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{location}} of Moro's imprisonment is disputed.

25|$|When the <b>Red</b> <b>Brigades</b> {{decided to}} murder Moro, they {{placed him in}} a car and told him to cover himself with a blanket saying {{that they were going to}} {{transport}} him to another location. After Moro was covered they shot him ten times. According to the official reconstruction after a series of trials, the killer was Mario Moretti. Moro's body was left in the trunk of a red Renault 4 on Via Michelangelo Caetani towards the Tiber River near the Roman Ghetto.|$|E
25|$|The {{depositions}} {{made to the}} Italian judges {{during the}} trials showed that not all the <b>Red</b> <b>Brigades</b> leaders were for condemning Moro to death. Mario Moretti called Moro's wife by phone, asking her to push the DC leaders for negotiations.
