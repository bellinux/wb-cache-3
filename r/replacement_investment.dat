50|$|In economics, net {{investment}} is spending {{which increases the}} availability of fixed capital goods or means of production and goods inventories. It is the total spending on newly produced physical capital (fixed investment) and on inventories (inventory investment)—that is, gross investment—minus <b>replacement</b> <b>investment,</b> which simply replaces depreciated capital goods.|$|E
50|$|Similarly, net {{investment}} in physical capital such as machinery equals gross (total) investment minus the dollar amount of <b>replacement</b> <b>investment</b> that offsets depreciation of pre-existing machinery, thus giving {{the change in}} the amount of machinery available for use. Likewise, net national product equals gross national product minus depreciation.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a broad analysis of how non-migrants {{are affected by}} immigration {{in the presence of}} public goods. Welfare-effects of migration are first considered in a comparative-static framework which is then supplemented by an analysis of costs and benefits in a more-period-context. This enables a consideration of immigration-induced expansions of the public capital stock {{on the one hand and}} its effects on public enlargement and <b>replacement</b> <b>investments</b> on the other. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{expression}} {{for the cost}} of capital is derived when net and <b>replacement</b> <b>investments</b> exhibit differences in their effective prices due to a different fiscal treatment. It is shown that, contrary to previous results in the literature, the cost of capital should be constructed under an opportunity cost criterion rather than a historical one. This result has some important economic consequences, since the optimizing firm will take into account not only the effective price for the new investments but also consider the opportunity cost of replacing them. grants on net investments, cost of capital...|$|R
40|$|Using {{level data}} from the U.

An investment decision model is estimated using a panel data set composed of the major <b>replacement</b> <b>investments</b> made in forty-three steel plants during the years 1960 - 81.

50|$|For example, Michael Perelman {{has argued}} in his 1989 book Keynes, Investment Theory and the Economic Slowdown: The Role of <b>Replacement</b> <b>Investment</b> and q-Ratios that the US Federal Reserve Board measure {{is just not}} very revealing. Prior to the early 1980s, he argues, American {{business}} carried {{a great deal of}} extra capacity. Running close to 80% indicated at the time approaching capacity restraints. Since that time, firms scrapped much of their most inefficient capacity. As a result, a modern 77% capacity utilization now would be equivalent to a historical level of 70%.|$|E
40|$|In an intertemporal model, we {{analyze the}} timing of {{irreversible}} and lumpy monopoly investment under certainty. There are two reasons for investing, i. e. wear and tear leading to <b>replacement</b> <b>investment</b> and demand growth leading to expansion investment. Both in a single investment setting and in a repeated investment setting, we find that a firm maximizing discounted social welfare invests earlier than an identical firm maximizing discounted profits. The investment date of an identical firm maximizing a discounted convex combination of social welfare and profits lies between these polar cases.

We consider the replacement problem under stochastic interest rates in a CIR economy (Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross 1985 a,b). Depending on the interest rate levels, interest rate volatility and the optionality to switch between durable and expendable assets at each renewal time, managers may prefer to invest in long-lived but more expensive assets instead of short-lived but less costly assets and vice versa. real options, interest rate uncertainty, <b>replacement</b> <b>investment</b> decisions, interest rate policy,...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on the effect of a {{progressive}} tax system on optimal tax depreciation. By using dynamic optimization we show that an optimal strategy exists, and we provide an analytical expression for the optimal depreciation charges. Depreciation charges initially decrease over time, and after a number of periods the firm enters a steady state where depreciation is constant and equal to <b>replacement</b> <b>investments.</b> This way, the optimal solution trades off the benefits of accelerated depreciation (because of discounting) and of constant depreciation (because of the progressive tax system). We show that the steady state will be reached sooner when the initial tax base is lower or when the discounting effect is stronger. ...|$|R
30|$|Moreover, past masterplans {{underestimated the}} {{requirements}} for replacements. Whereas new projects have been included into the masterplan and construction has been started, <b>investment</b> into <b>replacements</b> even stayed below the projected values (again {{with the exception of}} the year 2009 – Source: [6]). As a consequence, large parts of the German federal roads require maintenance and <b>replacement</b> <b>investments,</b> this is of particular relevance for bridges, leading to a specific priority program for bridge maintenance and upgrading, set up by the ministry for transport. The new masterplan, enacted in 2016, names the maintenance and replacement of the current infrastructure as its top priority, allocating 69 % of the total funding to this purpose [14]. In the previous masterplans the share of investment into maintaining the existing infrastructure was 56 % (BVWP 2003) and 46 % (BVWP 1992), respectively [11].|$|R
40|$|When network {{regulation}} {{was introduced}} in New Zealand the implications for investment on ageing assets went largely unrecognised. Consequently even though wide-ranging power outages have signalled the need for substantial <b>replacement</b> <b>investment</b> in infrastructure there is no 'replacement investment' model in the regulatory tool kit.

40|$|The {{emphasis}} of capital theory {{in recent decades}} has {{moved away from the}} implications of useful life as an important economic variable and has turned on the microeconomic and macroeconomic consequences of investment irreversibilities. Thus the voluminous literature that has developed ignores the marked difference be-tween replacement and scrapping and glosses over their significant implications for microeconomic and aggregate dynamics. This paper highlights the gains in explana-tory power that result when useful life, replacement and scrapping are placed {{in the center of the}} analysis. It does so by considering an economy with two representative firms that differ only in that the one applies replacement and the other scrapping. Among other interesting findings, at the microeconomic level it turns out that the de-mand for <b>replacement</b> <b>investment</b> is not invariant with respect to the type of capital policy being applied, whereas at the macroeconomic level it is shown that we cannot obtain consistent aggregates of capital stock and <b>replacement</b> <b>investment.</b> Capital, investment, service life, replacement, scrapping...|$|E

40|$|Using {{a unique}} panel data set of private German firms {{over the period}} 2002 to 2013 we analyze the {{relation}} between managerial overconfidence and investment policy in small and medium-sized firms.

We find that overconfident managers are more likely to invest, and that this relation is driven by expansion investments (as opposed to <b>replacement</b> <b>investments).</b> Most importantly, we provide empirical evidence on the determinants of failed (downsized, delayed or abandoned) corporate investment projects. Controlling for socio-demographic variables and firm characteristics, we find that investment projects planned by overconfident managers are more likely to fail.

40|$|Until 2030, {{important}} <b>replacement</b> <b>investments</b> {{are needed}} in the EU power plant sector, which are expected to attain between 300 and 600 GW of installed capacity. Also {{elsewhere in the world}} the generating capacities built up during the high growth phase in the 1960 s and 1970 s will have to be replaced and new capacities have to be installed, leading according to recent IEA studies to investments in about 5, 000 GW of new generating capacities between 2000 and 2030. Even if part of the investment will certainly be done in renewable power plants such as wind and fuel cells, there will be most likely also a need for new thermal power plants. These investments represent important strategic decisions for electric utilities since power plants require large investment sums and, once effectuated, they are predominantly sunk costs. Yet there is considerable uncertainty on what power plants will be most profitable for companies and/or society over their lifetime. Primary energy prices are one major source of uncertainty, another, related one, are future CO 2 prices. Notably with the raise of gas prices since mid 1999, it has become rather questionable whether gas-fuelled power plants are the option of choice for new thermal power stations. Coal, nuclear and (where available) lignite are potential alternatives. In this context, novel methods are needed to assess the profitability under uncertainty of the various types of thermal power plants.

Its key ingredients are search frictions and Williamsonian relation-specific investment, implying that new investments are made only after having found a new long-term partner.

40|$|Massachusetts’ {{natural gas}} {{distribution}} systems – pipes delivering gas for fuel into {{homes and businesses}} – are leaking large quantities of gas due to aging and crumbling infrastructure – primarily pipes made of the outdated materials cast iron and unprotected steel. This is problematic in several ways. First, public safety is at risk from explosions and fires from the leaked gas; second, uncombusted methane in natural gas is a more potent global warming gas than carbon dioxide – contributing to climate change; and third, ratepayers bear {{the cost of the}} lost gas, as well as the costs of publicly- and privately-owned trees and shrubs that are harmed by soil health damage near the leaks. This master’s project explores actions being taken or considered in Massachusetts and in states with similar gas infrastructure to reduce natural gas leaks, and includes recommendations to achieve further reductions. A comparative case study approach was used to examine Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New York, and federal policy activity. Methods for the case studies included examination of publicly-available materials as well as interviews with individuals from different areas of expertise or leadership with respect to gas distribution systems. Findings indicate that there is no single, simple, or inexpensive solution to eliminating gas leaks from old, leak-prone infrastructure, but that a combination of approaches from the multiple states studied may lead to reductions in gas loss if implemented in Massachusetts. Recommendations include: adoption of consistent measurement and reporting criteria for lost gas from all utilities as modeled by Pennsylvania’s 2013 regulations revisions; creation or expansion of incentives for utilities to reduce leakage such as New York’s innovative benchmark and profit incentive for utilities alongside the federally proposed state revolving loan fund model for capital investments in system upgrade costs; and incorporation of the value of avoided environmental damage into all cost benefit analyses for aging pipeline repair and replacement. Finally, caution is needed in any new regulation or practice adopted to be assured that repair and <b>replacement</b> <b>investments</b> are served, and funding not redirected for additional natural gas capacity, keeping in mind that overreliance on any single fuel could prove a foolish gamble...|$|R
