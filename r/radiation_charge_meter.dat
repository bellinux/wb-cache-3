Two point-of-care analysers, designed for human diabetics, were evaluated for use in dogs. Blood samples were collected from 50 normoglycaemic dogs, 100 diabetic patients and five dogs with insulinoma and tested using the In <b>Charge</b> fructosamine <b>meter</b> and the Haemaquant/Glycosal HbA 1 c meter. Readings were obtained in all cases except for 21 of 50 diabetics, which were above the upper limit of the In <b>Charge</b> <b>meter.</b> Diabetic dogs had higher fructosamine and HbA 1 c concentrations compared to controls. However, there was poor agreement between the In <b>Charge</b> <b>meter</b> readings and serum fructosamine concentrations, suggesting that there are problems {{associated with the use of}} this device in dogs. HbA 1 c concentrations showed a high degree of correlation with glycosylated haemoglobin measured at an external laboratory, suggesting that the Haemaquant/Glycosal meter warrants further evaluation for veterinary use...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} {{the study of the}} effects of {{electron}} (8 MeV) irradiation on the dielectric and ferroelectric properties of PbZrO 3 thin films grown by sol-gel technique. The films were (0. 62 mu m thick) subjected to electron irradiation using Microtron accelerator (delivered dose 80, 100, 120 kGy). The films were well crystallized prior to and after electron irradiation. However, local amorphization was observed after irradiation. There is an appreciable change in the dielectric constant after irradiation with different delivered doses. The dielectric loss showed significant frequency dispersion for both unirradiated and electron irradiated films. T (c) was found to shift towards higher temperature with increasing delivered dose. The effect of radiation induced increase of E >'(T) is related to an internal bias field, which is caused by <b>radiation</b> induced <b>charges</b> trapped at grain boundaries. The double butterfly loop is retained even after electron irradiation to the different delivered doses. The broader hysteresis loop seems to be related to <b>radiation</b> induced <b>charges</b> causing an enhanced space charge polarization. Radiation-induced oxygen vacancies do not change the general shape of the AFE hysteresis loop but they increase P (s) of the hysteresis at the electric field forced AFE to FE phase transition. We attribute the changes in the dielectric properties to the structural defects such as oxygen vacancies and <b>radiation</b> induced <b>charges.</b> The shift in T (C), increase in dielectric constant, broader hysteresis loop, and increase in P (r) can be related to <b>radiation</b> induced <b>charges</b> causing space charge polarization.
