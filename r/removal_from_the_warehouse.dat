2500|$|Charles's mother, Elizabeth Dickens, did not {{immediately}} support his <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> boot-blacking <b>warehouse.</b> This influenced Dickens's view that a father should rule the family, and a mother find her proper sphere inside the home: [...] "I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget, {{that my mother was}} warm for my being sent back". His mother's failure to request his return was a factor in his dissatisfied attitude towards women.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a single-item, two-echelon, continuous-review inventory model. A number of retailers have their stock replenished <b>from</b> a central <b>warehouse.</b> <b>The</b> <b>warehouse</b> in turn replenishes stock from an external supplier. The demand processes on the retailers are independent Poisson. Demand not {{met at a}} retailer is lost. <b>The</b> order quantity <b>from</b> each retailer on <b>the</b> <b>warehouse</b> and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>warehouse</b> on <b>the</b> supplier takes the same fixed value Q, an exogenous variable determined by packaging and handling constraints. Retailer i follows a (Q,R i) control policy. <b>The</b> <b>warehouse</b> operates an (SQ,(S 1) Q) policy, with non-negative integer S. If <b>the</b> <b>warehouse</b> is in stock then the lead time for retailer i is the fixed transportation time Li <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>warehouse</b> to that retailer. Otherwise retailer orders are met, after a delay, on a first-come first-served basis. The lead time on a warehouse order is fixed. Two further assumptions are made: that each retailer may only have one order outstanding {{at any time and}} that <b>the</b> transportation time <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>warehouse</b> to a retailer is not less than <b>the</b> <b>warehouse</b> lead time. <b>The</b> performance measures of interest are the average total stock in the system and the fraction of demand met in the retailers. Procedures for determining these performance measures and optimising the behaviour of the system are developed. Ó 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
