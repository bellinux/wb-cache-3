30|$|Root hairs {{differentiate}} from epidermal cells, and their patterning {{has been extensively}} studied in A. thaliana, which exhibits a distinct position-dependent pattern of root-hair cells and nonhair cells [29]. Root-hair cells (trichoblasts) are present outside the intercellular space between underlying cortical cells, whereas nonhair (atrichoblasts) cells can be found adjacent to cortical cells. This radial pattern is clearly absent in rice, in which all epidermal cell files bear root hairs. However, within each epidermal cell file, a root-hair epidermal cell (the shorter cell) is always adjacent to a non-root-hair cell (the longer cell), suggesting that the root-hair epidermal cell appears after the single cell division that generates the <b>root-hair</b> <b>cell</b> and non-root-hair cell [51]. The A. thaliana root-hair patterning type is shared by all species of the Brassicae genus [29], whereas the rice pattern (i.e., a short cell bearing a root hair alternating on the same file with a long, non-root-hair cell) is typical of monocotyledonous plants [9], as well as ferns and basal angiosperms [59]. Recent results have demonstrated that downstream cis-regulatory modules for root-hair-specific gene expression are conserved across angiosperms, despite divergence of upstream fate-determining machinery. These divergent processes {{are responsible for the}} distinctive root-hair patterning observed in the root epidermis [59]. Asymmetric division gives rise to the alternating short and long cells present in epidermal cell files. The distal daughter of the initiating mitosis becomes the trichoblast in Poacees (including rice), Juncaceae, Restionaceae, and Cyperaceae, although this role is played by the proximal daughter cell among most other monocots, generating a vertical pattern [10]. When the function of root hairs declines, they are shed from the root together with the epidermal cells. The exodermis then becomes lignified, so as to maintain the root structure along with the sclerenchyma cell layer.|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of the plant root {{is one of the}} remarkable examples of land plants’ adaptation to the terrestrial environment. The root and root hairs are found in almost all vascular plants, making them good models to study the conservation and diversification of adaptations in different vascular lineages. The molecular basis of root and root hair development has been intensively studied in the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana and many of the key regulators have been elucidated over the past 20 years. However, {{little is known about the}} molecular basis of root and root hair development in other vascular plants, which prevents a detailed understanding of root and root hair adaptation at a mechanistic level. In this thesis project, I compared the gene expression programs in seven vascular plants to find the conserved/diversified regulators in root and root hair development. First, I defined temporal transcript accumulation profiles generated from three root development zones in seven vascular plants and found significant family-wise gene expression similarity between these plants. Next, I found that most of the 133 Arabidopsis key root development genes are used in all vascular plants, including Selaginella moellendorffii, which is thought to have evolved roots independently. These results suggest broad conservation in the molecular mechanisms employed during root formation. Next, I defined the root hair transcriptome in Arabidopsis and rice and found significant conservation in the two species. However, a subset of 563 genes regulated by ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 6 (RHD 6) exhibited less conservation compared to the total root-hair-expressed genes. This divergence in the family structure and gene expression is found in other vascular plants as well. I further analyzed the Arabidopsis root hair patterning genes in other vascular plants and identified a substantial difference in their expression patterns. These results suggest lineage specific diversification in the structure and expression of the root hair development genes in Arabidopsis. Altogether, this thesis work revealed broad conservation of gene expression programs for root formation in all vascular plants and lineage specific diversification for <b>root-hair</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation in Arabidopsis...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{extracellular}} Ca 2 + in root-hair tip {{growth has}} been investigated in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. Root-hair length {{was found to be}} dependent on the concentration of Ca 2 + in the growth medium, with maximum length achieved at [Ca 2 +] of 0. 3 – 3. 0 mM. Using a non-intrusive calcium-specific vibrating microelectrode, an extracellular Ca 2 + gradient was detected at the tips of individual growing <b>root-hair</b> <b>cells.</b> The direction of the gradient indicated a net influx of Ca 2 + into <b>root-hair</b> <b>cells.</b> No gradient was detected near the sides of the root hairs or at the tips of non-growing root hairs. When root hairs were exposed to the Ca 2 + -channel blocker nifedipine, tip growth stopped and the extracellular Ca 2 + gradient was abolished. These results indicate that Ca 2 + influx through plasma-membrane Ca 2 + channels is required for normal root-hair tip growth...|$|R
40|$|SCRAMBLED (SCM), a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, mediates {{positional}} signaling and cell-type pattern {{formation in}} the epidermis of Arabidopsis roots. The precise mechanism of SCM action has been unclear. In a recent report, we find that accumulation of the SCM-GFP fusion protein varies in a cell-type-specific manner during root epidermis development. At early stages, SCM-GFP accumulates equally in both <b>root-hair</b> <b>cells</b> and nonhair cells, but at later stages of epidermis development, it accumulates preferentially in <b>root-hair</b> <b>cells.</b> The importance of epidermal production of SCM was demonstrated by epidermis-specific SCM-GFP silencing, which caused an epidermal patterning defect. Further, the expression of SCM-GFP by a root-hair-cell promoter complements the scm- 2 epidermal defect completely, whereas a non-hair-cell promoter complements the scm- 2 epidermal phenotype partially. From these results we conclude that the spatial distribution of a positional cue and the accumulation of the SCM receptor are both required for optimal positional signaling in epidermal patterning...|$|R
40|$|The position-dependent {{specification}} of root epidermal cells in Arabidopsis provides an elegant paradigm for cell patterning during development. Here, we describe a new gene, SCRAMBLED (SCM), required for cells to appropriately interpret their location within the developing root epidermis. SCM encodes a receptor-like kinase protein with a predicted extracellular domain of six leucine-rich repeats and an intracellular serine-threonine kinase domain. SCM regulates {{the expression of}} the GLABRA 2, CAPRICE, WEREWOLF, and ENHANCER OF GLABRA 3 transcription factor genes that define the cell fates. Further, the SCM gene is expressed throughout the developing root. Therefore, SCM likely enables developing epidermal cells to detect positional cues and establish an appropriate cell-type pattern. A fundamental feature of development in mul-ticellular organisms is the {{specification of}} distinct cell types in appropriate patterns. In Arabidopsis, the patterning of the <b>root-hair</b> <b>cells</b> and non–hair cells in the root epidermis is determined by a position-dependent mechanism (1, 2). Developing epidermal cells overlying two cortical cells (the BH [cell position) prefer-entially differentiate as <b>root-hair</b> <b>cells,</b> whereas cells located outside a single cortical cell (the BN [position) adopt the non–hair cell fate. Both symplastic (e. g., direct cell-cell movement) and apoplastic (e. g., receptor-mediated cell-cell in-teraction) explanations have been proposed for the putative signaling mechanism (3, 4). A regulatory network including at least eight putative transcription factors is re-quired to specify the root epidermal cell types through the general mechanism of lateral in-hibition with feedback Ereviewed in (3 – 5) ^. WEREWOLF (WER, a MYB transcription factor), TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA (TTG, a WD 40 -repeat protein), and GLABRA...|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} cell fate was {{investigated}} in the root epidermis of Arabidopsis thaliana. Two distinct types of differentiated epidermal cells are normally present: root-hair-bearing Cells and hairless cells. In wild-type Arabidopsis roots, epidermal cell fate {{was found to be}} correlated with <b>cell</b> position, with <b>root-hair</b> <b>cells</b> located over radial walls between cortical cells, and with hairless cells located directly over cortical cells. This normal positional relationship was absent in ttg (transparent testa glabrous) mutants (lacking trichomes, anthocyanins, and seed coat mucilage); epidermal cells in all positions differentiate into <b>root-hair</b> <b>cells.</b> The opposite condition was generated in roots of transgenic Arabidopsis expressing the maize R (R-Lc) gene product (a putative TTG homologue) under the control of a strong promoter (CaMV 35 S), which produced hairless epidermal cells in all positions. In both the ttg and R -expressing roots, epidermal cell differentiation was affected at an early stage, prior to the onset of <b>cell</b> elongation or <b>root-hair</b> formation. The ttg mutations were also associated with abnormalities in the morphology and organization of cells within and surrounding the root apical meristem. The results indicate that alterations in TTG activity cause developing epidermal cells to misinterpret their position and differentiate into inappropriate cell types. This suggests that, in wild-type roots, TTG provides, or responds to, positional signals to cause differentiating epidermal cells that lie over cortical cells to adopt a hairless cell fate...|$|R

40|$|The {{root hair}} of Arabidopsis {{has become a}} model system for {{investigations}} of the patterning and morphogenesis of cells in plants. A cascade of transcriptional regulators controls the pattern of cellular differentiation. Recently, one of the genes that plays a specific role in cellular differentiation in roots, WEREWOLF, {{has been shown to}} be functionally equivalent to GLABRA 1, which functions only in the shoot. The cloning of genes defined by mutants with defective root-hair growth has provided insights into the roles of the cell wall, ion transport and the cytoskeleton during hair growth.

40|$|In <b>root-hair</b> <b>cells</b> of Sinapis alba, cytosolic pH, cytosolic [Cl-], {{membrane}} potential, and membrane resistance {{have been}} measured to investigate proton-driven Cl- transport across the plasma membrane. Rapid lowering {{of the external}} pH transiently increased cytosolic [Cl-] and acidified the cytoplasm. To an abrupt increase in external [Cl-] the cells reacted with a rapid initial depolarization and a subsequent slower hyperpolarization, which was accompanied {{by an increase in}} cytosolic [Cl-] and [H+]. These results are indicative of an nH+/Cl- symport with n > 1. Simultaneous recording of the membrane potential, the proton motive force, cytosolic pH, and cytosolic [Cl-] reveals that kinetically this Cl- transport depends on the pH gradient across the plasma membrane rather than on the membrane potential...|$|R
40|$|Postmitotic cell growth defines cell {{shape and}} size during development. However, the {{mechanisms}} regulating postmitotic cell growth in plants remain unknown. Here we report {{the discovery of a}} basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor called RSL 4 (ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 6 -LIKE 4) that is sufficient to promote postmitotic cell growth in Arabidopsis thaliana <b>root-hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Loss of RSL 4 function resulted in the development of very short root hairs. In contrast, constitutive RSL 4 expression programmed constitutive growth, resulting in the formation of very long root hairs. Hair-cell growth signals, such as auxin and low phosphate availability, modulate hair cell extension by regulating RSL 4 transcript and protein levels. RSL 4 is thus a regulator of growth that integrates endogenous developmental and exogenous environmental signals that together control postmitotic growth in root hairs. The control of postmitotic growth by transcription factors may represent a general mechanism for regulating cell size across diverse organisms.

40|$|SummaryROP/RAC GTPases are master {{regulators}} of cell polarity in plants, {{implicated in}} the regulation of diverse signaling cascades including cytoskeleton organization, vesicle trafficking, and Ca 2 + gradients [1 – 8]. The involvement of ROPs in differentiation processes is yet unknown. Here we show the identification of a novel ROP/RAC effector, designated interactor of constitutive active ROPs 1 (ICR 1), that interacts with GTP-bound ROPs. ICR 1 knockdown or silencing leads to cell deformation and loss of root stem-cell population. Ectopic expression of ICR 1 phenocopies activated ROPs, inducing cell deformation of leaf-epidermis-pavement and <b>root-hair</b> <b>cells</b> [3, 5, 6, 9]. ICR 1 is comprised of coiled-coil domains and forms complexes with itself and the exocyst vesicle-tethering complex subunit SEC 3 [10 – 13]. The ICR 1 -SEC 3 complexes can interact with ROPs in vivo. Plants overexpressing a ROP- and SEC 3 -noninteracting ICR 1 mutant have a wild-type phenotype. Taken together, our results show that ICR 1 is a scaffold-mediating formation of protein complexes that are required for cell polarity, linking ROP/RAC GTPases with vesicle trafficking and differentiation...|$|R
40|$|The {{plant hormone}} auxin {{controls}} root epidermal cell {{development in a}} concentration-dependent manner 1, 2, 3. Root hairs are produced on a subset of epidermal cells as they increase in distance from the root tip. Auxin is required for their initiation 4, 5, 6, 7 and continued growth 8, 9, 10, 11, but {{little is known about}} its distribution in this region of the root. Contrary to the expectation that hair cells might require active auxin influx to ensure auxin supply, we did not detect the auxin-influx transporter AUX 1 in <b>root-hair</b> <b>cells.</b> A high level of AUX 1 expression was detected in adjacent non-hair cell files. Non-hair cells were necessary to achieve wild-type root-hair length, although an auxin response was not required in these cells. Three-dimensional modelling of auxin flow in the root tip suggests that AUX 1 -dependent transport through non-hair cells maintains an auxin supply to developing hair cells as they increase in distance from the root tip, and sustains root-hair outgrowth. Experimental data support the hypothesis that instead of moving uniformly though the epidermal cell layer 3, 12, auxin is mainly transported through canals that extend longitudinally into the tissue...|$|R
40|$|The {{symbiotic}} {{nitrogen fixation}} (SNF) with legumes {{is the primary}} source of biologically fixed nitrogen for agricultural system. It is performed by a group of bacteria commonly called rhizobia. It is characterized by a host preference, and the differences among symbioses between rhizobial strains and legume genotypes are related to infection, nodule development and effectiveness in N 2 fixation. The interaction between a rhizobia and the legume is mediated by a lipochitin oligosaccharide secreted by the rhizobia, and called “Nod factor”. It is recognized by transmembrane receptors on the <b>root-hair</b> <b>cells</b> of the legume. It can regulate the nodule organogenesis by inducing changes in the cytokinin balance of the root, during nodule initiation. N 2 fixation in legume nodules is catalyzed by the nitrogenase enzyme depending upon the photosynthate supply, the O 2 concentration, and the fixed-N export. Among environmental factors that influence the SNF, the temperature is essential for nodule formation; the salinity and drought decrease the nodule permeability to O 2 and the photosynthate supply to the nodule, the phosphorus deficiency inhibits the nodule development and the total N 2 fixation. Rhizobia strains differ in their efficiency in N 2 fixation with host legume. There is evidence of genotypic variability for SNF at different levels of available P which show a possibility of selecting cultivars able to support biological N 2 fixation under low P soils...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{cell wall}} {{composition}} {{is important for}} regulating growth rates, especially in roots. However, neither analyses of cell wall composition nor transcriptomes on their own can comprehensively reveal which genes and processes are mediating growth and cell elongation rates. This study reveals the benefits of carrying out multiple analyses in combination. Sections of roots from five anatomically and functionally defined zones in Arabidopsis thaliana were prepared and divided into three biological replicates. We used glycan microarrays and antibodies to identify the major classes of glycans and glycoproteins present in the cell walls of these sections, and identified the expected decrease in pectin and increase in xylan from the meristematic zone (MS), through the rapid and late elongation zones (REZ, LEZ) to the maturation zone {{and the rest of}} the root, including the emerging lateral roots. Other compositional changes included extensin and xyloglucan levels peaking in the REZ and increasing levels of arabinogalactan-proteins (AGP) epitopes from the MS to the LEZ, which remained high through the subsequent mature zones. Immuno-staining using the same antibodies identified the tissue and (sub) cellular localization of many epitopes. Extensins were localized in epidermal and cortex cell walls, while AGP glycans were specific to different tissues from <b>root-hair</b> <b>cells</b> to the stele. The transcriptome analysis found several gene families peaking in the REZ. These included a large family of peroxidases (which produce the reactive oxygen species (ROS) needed for cell expansion), and three xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase/hydrolase genes (XTH 17, XTH 18, and XTH 19). The significance of the latter may be related to a role in breaking and re-joining xyloglucan cross-bridges between cellulose microfibrils, a process which is required for wall expansion. Knockdowns of these XTHs resulted in shorter root lengths, confirming a role of the corresponding proteins in root extension growth...|$|R
40|$|SummaryCellular pattern {{formation}} in the root epidermis of Arabidopsis occurs in a position-dependent manner, generating <b>root-hair</b> (H) <b>cells</b> contacting two underlying cortical cells and nonhair (N) cells contacting one cortical cell [1 – 3]. SCRAMBLED (SCM), a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK), mediates this process through its effect on a downstream transcription factor regulatory network [4, 5]. After perception of a positional cue, the SCM signaling pathway is proposed to preferentially repress WEREWOLF (WER) transcription factor expression in H cells and thereby bias the outcome of mutual lateral inhibition acting between H and N cells [6, 7]. However, the molecular mechanism responsible for this preferential SCM signaling is unknown. Here, we analyze {{the distribution of the}} SCM receptor and the biological effect of altering its accumulation pattern. We find that SCM expression and accumulation in the epidermal cell layer is necessary and sufficient to direct the cell-type pattern. Further, SCM preferentially accumulates in H cells, and this accumulation pattern is dependent on the downstream transcription factors. Thus, SCM participates in an autoregulatory feedback loop, enabling cells engaged in SCM signaling to maintain high levels of SCM receptor, which provides a simple mechanism for reinforcing a bias in receptor-mediated signaling to ensure robust pattern formation...|$|R
40|$|Roots of the non-nodulating Medicago sativa mutant MN- 1008 neither undergo <b>root-hair</b> curling, {{cortical}} <b>cell</b> division {{nor any of}} {{the early}} molecular events that accompany nodule initiation and development following rhizobial infection or treatment with Nod factor. These observations suggested that the mutation(s) impaired a pivotal function in Nod factor perception or in the signal transduction pathway. In this paper we show that the genetic lesion conditioning the recessive non-nodulation phenotype in the tetraploid alfalfa mutant MN- 1008 can be localized to a single region on LG 5 of the M. sativa genetic map. This conclusion is based on genetic analyses conducted at the tetraploid level, involving both segregation analysis and genetic mapping of the trait with respect to molecular DNA markers. The genetic mapping of the Nod(-) phenotype was performed in a segregating tetraploid F 2 population, {{taking advantage of the}} availability of an advanced genetic map for diploid alfalfa. Two tightly linked flanking markers have been identified which will facilitate the physical mapping and cloning of the gene(s) that underlie(s) the non-nodulation phenotype...|$|R

We show that the number of coiled bodies, nuclear organelles in which splicing snRNPs and snRNAs concentrate, is developmentally regulated in the Arabidopsis root epidermis. Firstly, there is a progression from a small number of coiled bodies in the quiescent centre and initial cells, to a larger number in the cell division zone, returning to a lower number in the cell elongation and differentiation zone. Secondly, trichoblasts (<b>root-hair</b> forming epidermal <b>cells)</b> have on average 1. 5 times more and often smaller coiled bodies than atrichoblasts (hairless epidermal cells). Moreover, we have shown that these differences in coiled body numbers are related to differences in cell cycle stage, cell type and developmental stage, but are not due to differences in nucleolar or general metabolic activity per se. We discuss possible explanations, including a model in which coiled bodies coalesce during interphase, for the developmental dynamics of coiled bodies...|$|R
40|$|Root hairs {{cells are}} highly {{polarized}} cellular structures resulting from tip growth of specific root epidermal <b>cells.</b> <b>Root-hair</b> morphogenesis involves many aspects regulating tip growth such as exocitosis, ion flux, calcium homeostasis, {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS), and cytoskeleton. These cells are excellent models for studying polar growth and can be challenged with many extracellular factors affecting the pattern of growth named Nod factors, elicitors, hormones, etc. The general scenery is that the well described tip-high intracellular Ca 2 + gradient plays {{a central role in}} regulating tip growth. On the other hand, ROS {{plays a key role in}} various processes, for example hypersensitive response, root hair development, hormone action, gravitropism and stress responses. However, ROS has recently emerged as a key player together with calcium in regulating polar growth, not only in root hair cells but also in pollen tubes, filamentous fungi and fucoid cells. Furthermore, Ca 2 +-permeable channel modulation by ROS has been demonstrated in Vicia faba guard cells and Arabidopsis root hairs. Recently, root hair cells were shown to experiment ROS, pH and calcium oscillations coupled to growth oscillation. These recent findings allow considering that root hair cells present a similar pattern of growth as described for pollen tubes...|$|R
40|$|The root {{epidermis}} of Arabidopsis {{provides an}} exceptional model {{for studying the}} molecular basis of cell fate and differentiation. To obtain a systems-level view of root epidermal cell differentiation, we used a genome-wide transcriptome approach to define and organize a large set of genes into a transcriptional regulatory network. Using cell fate mutants that produce {{only one of the}} two epidermal cell types, together with fluorescence-activated cell-sorting to preferentially analyze the root epidermis transcriptome, we identified 1, 582 genes differentially expressed in the <b>root-hair</b> or non-hair <b>cell</b> types, including a set of 208 "core" root epidermal genes. The organization of the core genes into a network was accomplished by using 17 distinct root epidermis mutants and 2 hormone treatments to perturb the system and assess the effects on each gene's transcript accumulation. In addition, temporal gene expression information from a developmental time series dataset and predicted gene associations derived from a Bayesian modeling approach were used to aid the positioning of genes within the network. Further, a detailed functional analysis of likely bHLH regulatory genes within the network, including MYC 1, bHLH 54, bHLH 66, and bHLH 82, showed that three distinct subfamilies of bHLH proteins participate in root epidermis development in a stage-specific manner. The integration of genetic, genomic, and computational analyses provides a new view of the composition, architecture, and logic of the root epidermal transcriptional network, and it demonstrates the utility of a comprehensive systems approach for dissecting a complex regulatory network...|$|R
40|$|The {{establishment}} of distinct patterns of gene expression {{is essential to}} the differentiation of specialized cell types during the development of multicellular organisms. To investigate the regulatory networks involved in this cell fate specification, one can turn to the Arabidopsis root epidermis, where a position-dependent pattern of hair and non-hair cells serves as a pertinent and accessible model. Recent studies have implicated ribosomal protein and ribosome assembly factors in regulation of gene expression during development, however, the connection between ribosome biogenesis and root cell-type patterning has previously never been investigated. To that end, this thesis research explores the connection and function of a highly conserved ribosome biogenesis factor with respect to the development and epidermal patterning of the Arabidopsis root epidermis. 	The Arabidopsis DIM 1 A gene was identified in a genetic screen for genes required for position-dependent expression of non-hair fate regulator GLABRA 2. Our analysis has revealed that functional DIM 1 A is required for generation of distinct gene expression patterns in developing <b>root-hair</b> and non-hair <b>cells.</b> In addition to defects in root epidermal patterning, the dim 1 A mutant displays reduced root meristem cell division rate and deficient leaf size, shape, vascular patterning and trichome branching. Furthermore, DIM 1 A promoter activity and gene product are enriched in rapidly dividing plant tissues, supporting a role for DIM 1 A in Arabidopsis development and cell differentiation. 	The Dim 1 /KsgA family of dimethylases are a highly conserved enzymes involved in post-transcriptional modification of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and pre-rRNA processing. While the two small subunit RNA base modifications they catalyze are present in almost every known organism, the functional significance of these modifications is currently unknown. My experimental evidence indicates that the dim 1 A mutant lacks the two 18 S rRNA modifications without affecting pre-rRNA processing. In conclusion, I propose that DIM 1 A and the post-transcriptional rRNA modification it catalyzes are important for generating well-defined patterns of gene expression necessary for {{establishment of}} the two distinct cell fates in the Arabidopsis root epidermis...|$|R
