25|$|The {{principal}} waste-waters {{associated with}} mines and quarries are slurries of rock particles in water. These arise from rainfall washing exposed surfaces and haul roads {{and also from}} <b>rock</b> <b>washing</b> and grading processes. Volumes of water can be very high, especially rainfall related arisings on large sites. Some specialized separation operations, such as coal washing to separate coal from native rock using density gradients, can produce wastewater contaminated by fine particulate haematite and surfactants. Oils and hydraulic oils are also common contaminants.|$|R

There in Central Texas {{he found that the}} materials necessary for concrete production (gravel, sand, lime, and clay) were readily available. Gravel beds and sand bars occurred along the Guadalupe River. Lime could be made from limestone quarried nearby or from <b>rocks</b> <b>washed</b> down the river bottom. Caliche, thick sedimentary deposits of gravelly clay, lay so close to the surface that it was often dug to make a basement before being used in the concrete mix.|$|R
50|$|Spurn is a {{peninsula}} {{that extends}} southwards {{from the south}} eastern edge of Holderness. It is 3.5 mi long and in places is only 50 m wide.

5000|$|It was {{not long}} after Sacramento surpassed a {{population}} of 10,000, then the Great Flood of 1862 swept away much of it (and almost everything else along the Sacramento River) and put the rest under water. The flood waters were exacerbated by the sediments washed down by the millions of tons by hydraulic mining, which filled the beds of the Sacramento, Feather and American rivers up to 7 ft in Sacramento and also covered {{thousands of acres of}} Central Valley lands. A flood in 1875 covered the city of Marysville and when it subsided the town's streets were filled with debris and <b>rocks</b> <b>washed</b> down from the [...] "hydraulicking" [...] going on upstream.|$|R
60|$|A steep <b>rock,</b> <b>washed</b> by {{spouting}} foam, detached {{itself from}} the others and a narrow channel opened up {{between it and the}} beach. Agatha thought it looked horribly dangerous, but Thirlwell headed for the gap. They lurched through {{on the top of a}} curling wave, and she saw the mouth of the river behind the rock. The current rose in crested ridges where it met the wind, but the ridges were smaller than the waves on the lake and gradually sank to splashing ripples as the canoe ran up stream between dark walls of forest. The trees did not cut off the wind, which followed the channel, and by and by Thirlwell looked at Agatha.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} was to obtain kinetic and thermodynamic equilibrium of asphaltene sorption onto powder ROCK obtained from the Guadalupe formation (washed and unwashed) at different times, temperatures and concentrations. However, the effect of temperature in the equilibrium sorption is not significant. Rock powders were characterized by N 2 sorption at - 196 °C. Equilibrium sorption of asphaltenes in rock powders, within a range of concentrations from 250 to 1500 ppm, was determined using a static method. Sorption curves show Type I behavior, according to IUPAC. Langmuir model was used for computing the monolayer asphaltene content values for the sorption at different temperatures, showing a good fit respect to the experimental data. Sorption kinetics of asphaltenes in rock samples is function of the concentration and for concentrations of 1500 ppm equilibrium is reached about 90 min. Pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were applied to the experimental data for the different concentrations for the two rock samples with a better result for the pseudo-first order kinetic model. The washing effect on the equilibrium was not significant; however the adsorptive capacity of the <b>rock</b> without <b>washing</b> was slightly higher than the <b>rock</b> <b>washed</b> with n-heptane and toluene...|$|R

60|$|The fate of Alora speedily {{proved the}} truth of this opinion. It was {{strongly}} posted on a <b>rock</b> <b>washed</b> by a river. The artillery soon battered down two of the towers and a part of the wall. The Moors were thrown into consternation at the vehemence of the assault and the effect of those tremendous engines upon their vaunted bulwarks. The roaring of the artillery and the tumbling of the walls terrified the women, who beset the alcayde with vociferous supplications to surrender. The place was given up on the 20th of June, on condition that the inhabitants might depart with their effects. The people of Malaga, as yet unacquainted with the power of this battering ordnance, were so incensed at those of Alora for what they considered a tame surrender that they would not admit them into their city.|$|R
25|$|The mining of {{emeralds}} {{was conducted}} using coas, long thick wooden poles. The people dug holes {{during the rainy}} seasons next to the emerald-containing rocks and the emeralds from sedimentary <b>rocks</b> would <b>wash</b> into the holes that dried up and provided the clean emeralds. Emeralds from veins in metamorphic rocks were excavated using sharp poles.|$|R
60|$|Leaving the marsh, {{we reached}} a bare, rising plain, {{which led to}} the first slope of the Mountain three or four miles away. Here we {{expected}} every moment to be attacked by the savages of whom we had heard so much, but no living creature did we see. The place was a desert streaked with veins of rock that once had been molten lava. I do not remember much else about it; indeed, the pain in my arm was so sharp that I had no eyes for physical features. At length the rise ended in a bare, broad donga, quite destitute of vegetation, of which the bottom was buried in lava and a debris of <b>rocks</b> <b>washed</b> down by the rain or melting snows from slopes above. This donga was bordered on the farther side by a cliff, perhaps fifty feet in height, in which we could see no opening.|$|R
50|$|Many {{underground}} mines {{were constructed}} by the Romans. Once the raw ore {{was removed from the}} mine, it would be crushed, then washed. The less dense <b>rock</b> would <b>wash</b> away, leaving behind the iron oxide, which would then be smelted using the bloomery method. The iron was heated up to 1500 °C using charcoal. The remaining slag was removed and generally dumped.|$|R
60|$|The {{floor of}} the {{apartment}} in which he lay was of solid <b>rock,</b> cleanly <b>washed</b> and swept, {{but there was no}} furniture of any kind--only a pile of fresh-cut pine-branches, with which the place was perfumed, and two or three rough logs which had been used as seats the night before by the host and hostess of this--to March--enchanted castle.|$|R
50|$|By 1853, {{most of the}} easily mined gold {{had been}} exhausted, and {{hydraulic}} mining operations became the dominant extraction method. The Tuolumne County Water Company, first organized in 1851 to divert water from the Tuolumne River basin to the Stanislaus River, constructed a network of reservoirs, ditches and flumes initially used for mining and later for irrigation. The Golden Rock Water Company, incorporated in 1855, diverted the South Fork of the Tuolumne to supply the diggings at Groveland and Big Oak Flat; their most notable achievement was {{the construction of a}} 2200 ft long, 265 ft high aqueduct (the Big Gap Flume) over Buck Meadows. The first dam on the Tuolumne River proper, near La Grange, was built in 1852 to divert water for hydraulic mining. Sediment and <b>rocks</b> <b>washed</b> down by hydraulic mining and sluicing operations accumulated along the lower Tuolumne, destroying native floodplain habitat and making much of the river unnavigable.|$|R
60|$|By the river's edge was {{a little}} shore formed of round {{fragments}} of <b>rock</b> <b>washed</b> into this shape by the constant action of water, and giving the place the appearance of being strewn with thousands of fossil cannon balls. Evidently when {{the water of the}} underground river is high there is no beach at all, or very little, between the border of the stream and the precipitous cliffs; but now there was a space of seven or eight yards. And here, on this beach, we determined to land, in order to rest ourselves a little after all that we had gone through and to stretch our limbs. It was a dreadful place, but it would give an hour's respite from the terrors of the river, and also allow of our repacking and arranging the canoe. Accordingly we selected what looked like a favourable spot, and with some little difficulty managed to beach the canoe and scramble out on to the round, inhospitable pebbles.|$|R

His own reckless courage had brought him there; for in one of the many skirmishes in which he had taken part, he ventured too far away from his men, and was captured after fighting desperately to cut his way out. Now, alone in his cell, he raged like a caged eagle, feeling that there was no hope of escape; for the fort stood on a plateau of precipitous <b>rock</b> <b>washed</b> on two sides by the sea. He had heard of the massacre of the royalist emigrants who landed there, and tried to prepare himself for a like fate, hoping to die as bravely as young Sombreuil, who was shot with twenty others on what was afterward named the [...] "Champ des Martyrs."[3] His last words, when ordered by the executioner to kneel, were, [...] "I do it; but one knee I bend for my God, the other for my king." ...|$|R
