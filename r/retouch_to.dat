5000|$|In {{archaeology}} a flake tool {{is a type}} {{of stone}} tool that was used during the Stone Age that was created by striking a flake from a prepared stone core. People during prehistoric times often preferred these flake tools as compared to other tools because these tools were often easily made, could be made to be extremely sharp and could easily be repaired. Flake tools could be sharpened by <b>retouch</b> <b>to</b> create scrapers or burins. These tools were either made by flaking off small particles of flint or by breaking off a large piece and using that as a tool itself. These tools were able to be made by this [...] "chipping" [...] away effect due to the natural characteristic of stone. Stone is able to break apart when struck near the edge. Flake tools are created through flint knapping, a process of producing stone tools using lithic reduction. Lithic reduction is the removal of a lithic flake from a larger stone in order to reach the desired tool shape and size. The beginning stone is called the flake lithic core. There are three steps to lithic reduction: ...|$|E
40|$|The Oldowan Industrial Complex {{has long}} been {{thought to have been}} static, with limited {{internal}} variability, embracing techno-complexes essentially focused on small-to-medium flake production. The flakes were rarely modified by <b>retouch</b> <b>to</b> produce small tools, which do not show any standardized pattern. Usually, the manufacture of small standardized tools has been interpreted as a more complex behavior emerging with the Acheulean technology. Here we report on the ~ 1. 7 Ma Oldowan assemblages from Garba IVE-F at Melka Kunture in the Ethiopian highland. This industry is structured by technical criteria shared by the other East African Oldowan assemblages. However, there is also evidence of a specific technical process never recorded before, i. e. the systematic production of standardized small pointed tools strictly linked to the obsidian exploitation. Standardization and raw material selection in the manufacture of small tools disappear at Melka Kunture during the Lower Pleistocene Acheulean. This proves that 1) the emergence of a certain degree of standardization in tool-kits does not reflect in itself a major step in cultural evolution; and that 2) the Oldowan knappers, when driven by functional needs and supported by a highly suitable raw material, were occasionally able to develop specific technical solutions. The small tool production at ~ 1. 7 Ma, {{at a time when the}} Acheulean was already emerging elsewhere in East Africa, adds to the growing amount of evidence of Oldowan techno-economic variability and flexibility, further challenging the view that early stone knapping was static over hundreds of thousands of years...|$|E

5000|$|The bourgeois gesture was {{supposed}} to disappear from the view of Italians and not contaminate their daily life. [...] In 1938, the party abolished handshaking in films and theater, and on November 21, 1938 the Ministry of Popular Culture issued orders banning the publishing of photographs showing people shaking hands. [...] Even official photographs of visiting dignitaries were <b>retouched</b> <b>to</b> remove the image of their handshaking.|$|R
5000|$|The {{painting}} was painted from life with an informal handling, and Duveen {{may have had}} it <b>retouched</b> <b>to</b> appear more [...] "old masterish". The portrait closely resembles that of a figure at the far right of Surrender of Breda, also by Velázquez, which was painted to memorialize a victory by Spain over the Dutch. It is possible, though uncertain, that both portraits are self-representations of the artist.|$|R

25|$|Studio Proteus was {{responsible}} for the translation, the lettering, and the retouching of the artwork, which was flipped left-to-right to accommodate English readers. The original Japanese dialogue was re-lettered by hand, the original sound effects were replaced by English sound effects, and the artwork was <b>retouched</b> <b>to</b> accommodate the new sound effects. When Miyazaki resumed work on the manga following one of the interruptions, Viz chose another team, including Rachel Matt Thorn and Wayne Truman, to complete the series.|$|R

The 1979 Big Jim's Lazer-vette is probably the most notorious one. Its package was <b>retouched</b> <b>to</b> substitute Torpedo and Jim from the box' front for Kid Acero and Invisible Man, and the toy was renamed LOBO-mobile. The Devil Dune Buggy was repainted silver and released as Cobra-mobile.|$|R
50|$|Image editing {{is common}} {{practice}} for photographs used in advertising and publicity, and cover images are no exception. Image editing {{is an ongoing}} process of styling and selection, which invites debate on {{issues related to the}} representation of women. Arguably, advertising and cover images can help perpetuate an unattainable ideal of beauty, sometimes aided through methods of <b>retouching</b> <b>to</b> remove skin es and shadows under the eyes, smooth out skin texture, widen pupils, or suggest an hourglass figure.|$|R
50|$|In {{the judging}} room the contestants photos are shown {{with and without}} digital <b>retouching</b> <b>to</b> {{determine}} who has a fresh face and who has not.

25|$|Works by VanDerZee are artistic {{as well as}} {{technically}} proficient. His {{work was}} in high demand, {{in part due to}} his experimentation and skill in double exposures and in retouching negatives of children. One theme that recurs in his photographs was the emergent black middle class, which he captured using traditional techniques in often idealistic images. Negatives were <b>retouched</b> <b>to</b> show glamor and an aura of perfection. This affected the likeness of the person photographed, but he felt each photo should transcend the subject.|$|R
40|$|As {{the title}} suggests, this Master’s project treats the {{problems}} related <b>to</b> automatic <b>retouching</b> of user-selected regions in digital images. <b>Retouching</b> refers <b>to</b> {{the process of}} removing an arbitrary region from an image, {{replacing it with a}} substitute region that ultimately should blend in seamlessly with the other parts of the image. Automatic refers to that the user should not need to do anything else than select the region aimed for retouching and start the retouching algorithm. Retouching is an entirely subjective process, from the selection of the region <b>to</b> be <b>retouched</b> <b>to</b> the <b>retouching</b> process as well as the resulting image. The retouching in this Master’s project is aimed at ordinary images, e. g., arbitrary images from your family photo album. An extensive survey of previous work related <b>to</b> the <b>retouching</b> problem is summarized. A discussion regarding the user selection process is given. Details of implemented algorithms are described along with thei...|$|R

25|$|Concurrent {{with the}} sonar readings, the {{floodlit}} camera obtained {{a pair of}} underwater photographs. Both depicted {{what appeared to be}} a rhomboid flipper, although sceptics have dismissed the images as the bottom of the loch, air bubbles, a rock, or a fish fin. The apparent flipper was photographed in different positions, indicating movement. The first flipper photo is better-known than the second, and both were enhanced and retouched from the original negatives. According to team member Charles Wyckoff, the photos were <b>retouched</b> <b>to</b> superimpose the flipper; the original enhancement showed a considerably less-distinct object. No one is sure how the originals were altered.|$|R
5000|$|The {{circular}} crew patch was Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man, {{representing the}} mission's medical experiments and <b>retouched</b> <b>to</b> remove the genitalia.

The patch has a white background, the crew's names and [...] "Skylab II" [...] with a red, white and blue border.The wives of the crew secretly had an alternate graphic made of a 'universal woman' with their first names {{in place of the}} crew's. Stickers with this on them were put in lockers aboard the Command Module to surprise the crew.|$|R
