5|$|The {{most notable}} storms {{of the season}} were the five Category4 and Category5 hurricanes: Dennis, Emily, Katrina, <b>Rita,</b> <b>and</b> Wilma, along with the Category1 Hurricane Stan.

5|$|Research by Chandler, Griffin, and Sorensen into a {{link between}} letter names and {{donations}} has been widely accepted. They analyzed the records of disaster relief donations after seven hurricanes (among others, Katrina, <b>Rita</b> <b>and</b> Mitch). They {{found that people who}} shared an initial with the hurricane were overrepresented as donors. They concluded that people want to overcome some of the negative feelings associated with the shared name and thus donate.Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices, but would to low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity.|$|E

5|$|Animaniacs {{had a large}} cast of characters, {{separated}} into individual segments, with each pair or set of characters acting in its own plot. The Warners, Yakko, Wakko, and Dot, were three cartoon stars from the 1930s that were locked away in the Warner Bros. water tower until the 1990s, when they escaped. After their escape, they often interacted with Warner Bros. studio workers, including Ralph the Security Guard; Dr. Otto Scratchansniff, the studio psychiatrist, and his assistant Hello Nurse. Pinky and the Brain are two genetically altered laboratory mice who continuously plot and attempt {{to take over the}} world. Slappy Squirrel is an octogenarian cartoon star who can easily outwit antagonists and uses her wiles to educate her nephew, Skippy Squirrel, about cartoon techniques. Additional principal characters included <b>Rita</b> <b>and</b> Runt, Buttons and Mindy, Chicken Boo, Flavio and Marita (The Hip Hippos), Katie Ka-Boom, and a trio of pigeons known as The Goodfeathers.|$|E

Meanwhile, Rita is contacted by an imprisoned Paul, who contends that Dexter knocked him out and set him up. Rita becomes annoyed as Paul persists that Dexter is dangerous and should not be around their children. Rita is visited by Paul's Narcotics Anonymous sponsor, who attempts to convince Rita that Paul is telling the truth. In a final plea, Paul calls <b>Rita</b> <b>and</b> tells her to search their house for a shoe which he believes came off when Dexter knocked him out. Rita hangs up, but discovers the shoe while taking out the trash {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E
5|$|Before Animaniacs was {{put into}} {{production}} in 1991, various collaboration and brainstorming efforts were thought up to create both the characters and premise of the series. For instance, ideas that were thrown out were <b>Rita</b> <b>and</b> Runt being the hosts of the show and the Warners being duck characters that senior producer Tom Ruegger drew in his college years. After the characters from the series were created, they were all shown to executive producer Steven Spielberg, who would decide which characters would make it into Animaniacs (the characters Buttons and Mindy were chosen by Spielberg's daughter). The characters' designs came from various sources, including caricatures of other writers, designs based on early cartoon characters, and characters that simply had a more modern design.|$|E

5|$|During the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, Meridian {{was home}} to a Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) office and several other activist organizations. James Chaney and other local residents, along with Michael Schwerner, his wife <b>Rita,</b> <b>and</b> Andrew Goodman, volunteers from New York City, worked to create a {{community}} center. They held classes during Freedom Summer to help prepare African Americans {{in the area to}} prepare to regain their constitutional franchise, after having been excluded from politics since disenfranchisement in 1890. Whites in the area resented the activism, and physically attacked civil rights workers. In June 1964, Chaney, Schwerner, and Goodman went to Neshoba County, Mississippi, to meet with members of a black church that had been bombed and burned. The three disappeared that night on their way back to Meridian. Following a massive FBI investigation, their murdered bodies were found two months later, buried in an earthen dam.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} in both Los Angeles and Miami. The scenes filmed in Miami were shot in July 2006; those in Los Angeles were shot later. Scenes at the beach where Yelina talks with <b>Rita</b> <b>and</b> where her fiancé's body washes up were filmed at South Beach Park in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, north of Miami. A {{waterfront}} house on Hibiscus Island in Biscayne Bay, Florida stood in for the Castillos' home. The abandoned hospital where Dexter and the police find Tucci was filmed at the former Linda Vista Community Hospital in East Los Angeles, and Dexter's childhood home was filmed at {{a house in a}} residential neighborhood of Long Beach, California, where Rita's house is also filmed. Scenes in the salvage yard were filmed at LA Japanese Auto Parts in Sun Valley, California. The Airstream trailer in which Dexter commits the double murder was brought into the salvage yard for filming externally, but was assembled on a studio sound stage for shooting scenes inside the trailer.|$|E

5|$|The {{storm was}} {{initially}} expected {{to move into}} the Gulf of Mexico and affect people recovering from hurricanes Katrina, <b>Rita,</b> <b>and</b> Wilma in the previous year, which caused hundreds of billion in damage and left thousands of houses damaged or destroyed. There were initial fears that Ernesto would make landfall days after Hurricane Katrina's one-year anniversary, and that the levees in New Orleans {{might not be able to}} withstand a strong storm surge. Officials in New Orleans prepared buses and trains in the event that people needed to evacuate but could not. A possible path over the Gulf of Mexico oil fields, as well as tension with Iran, caused the price of oil to increase, although the prices receded when the threat of the storm receded.|$|E
5|$|The 2005 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the most}} active Atlantic {{hurricane season}} in recorded history, shattering numerous records. The impact of the season was widespread and ruinous with an estimated 3,913deaths and damage of about $158.9billion, the second-costliest on record. Of the storms that made landfall, five of the season's seven major hurricanes—Dennis, Emily, Katrina, <b>Rita,</b> <b>and</b> Wilma—were {{responsible for most of}} the destruction. Stan was the most destructive storm that was not a major hurricane. The Mexican states of Quintana Roo and Yucatán and the US states of Florida and Louisiana were each struck twice by major hurricanes; Cuba, the Bahamas, Haiti, Mississippi, Texas, Alabama, and Tamaulipas were each struck once and in each case brushed by at least one more. The most catastrophic effects of the season were felt on the United States' Gulf Coast, where a 30ft (10m) storm surge from Hurricane Katrina caused devastating flooding that destroyed most structures on the Mississippi coastline; subsequent levee failures in New Orleans, Louisiana caused by the storm crippled the city. Furthermore, Hurricane Stan combined with an extratropical system to cause deadly mudslides across Central America, with Guatemala being hardest-hit.|$|E
