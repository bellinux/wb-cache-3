40|$|A partly {{preserved}} squamation of Thelodus laevis (Pander) {{from the}} Himmiste outcrop (Saaremaa Island, Estonia) is described. Most {{of the trunk}} with a pectoral fin fragment and three fragments of posterior fins are present, while part {{of the head and}} the caudal fin are absent. Ontogenetic development of the scale cover of T. &# 160;laevis is explained by comparing it with the squamation of Lanarkia horrida Traquair, Loganellia scotica (Traquair) and a modern fish. It is supposed that newly forming trunk scales of early juvenile Thelodus were smooth and rhomboidal. When the individual grew, <b>ridged</b> <b>scales</b> were added between smooth ones in irregular rows in the posterior part of the trunk. Adult individuals were covered with species-specific scales with particular morphology and sculpture of the crown.

50|$|The new genus Polazzodus {{was erected}} {{based on a}} number of autapomorphies that {{distinguished}} it from similar pycnodontid fish. These include a second dorsal <b>ridge</b> <b>scale</b> (from which the Latin species name, coronatus, is derived), presence of olfactory fenestra on premaxilla, posterodorsal process on cleithrum, and several others. The largest measured recovered specimen was 97 mm (3.8 in), and the smallest was 30 mm (1.2 in), which represented a subadult specimen. Polazzodus, being a low-bodied pycnodont, is most similar morphologically to Pycnodus and Tergestrinia, though its body shape is more oval than these genera.|$|R
40|$|The Lower Carboniferous Albert shale {{formation}} of New Brunswick, Canada, is well-known {{for the preservation}} of countless articulated lower actinopterygian palaeoniscoid fishes. This site is at the boundary between the Devonian and the Lower Carboniferous, making the lower actinopterygians preserved at this site important. The taxonomic history of previously described Albert {{shale formation}} actinopterygians is reviewed here. Many of the earliest described actinopterygian taxa from the Albert Formation are represented by poorly preserved type specimens and have the distinction of being moved from one paraphyletic genus to another paraphyletic genus. While these taxa are in need of major redescriptions, such work is premature until the large paraphyletic or polyphyletic genera they have been placed in, Palaeonicus[m], † Rhadinichthys, and † Elonichthys, are redescribed. But there is new diversity within the Albert shale formation. Here, a new lower actinopterygian species, † Lambeia pectinatus, is described from one well-preserved specimen. This new species is characterized by dorsal <b>ridge</b> <b>scales</b> with pectinated posterior margins, body scales inserted between adjacent dorsal <b>ridge</b> <b>scales,</b> body scales with pectinated posterior and ventral margins, the presence of a ventral rostro-premaxilla and a median rostral bone, a separate and distinct antorbital bone, and a single supraorbital bone. This newly described species is distinct from previously described fishes from the Albert Formation, and the morphology of this newly described species is more similar to later Carboniferous fishes rather than Devonian fishes. This suggests that morphological features commonly seen in Carboniferous fishes and rarely seen in Devonian fishes were present early in the Carboniferous...|$|R
