40|$|Abstract Background Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) virus (ISAV) is a {{pathogen}} of marine-farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar); {{a disease}} first diagnosed in Norway in 1984. For over 25 years ISAV has caused major disease outbreaks in the Northern hemisphere, and remains an emerging fish pathogen {{because of the}} asymptomatic infections in marine wild fish {{and the potential for}} emergence of new epidemic strains. ISAV belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae, together with influenza viruses but is sufficiently different to be assigned to its own genus, Isavirus. The Isavirus genome consists of eight single-stranded RNA species, and the virions have two surface glycoproteins; fusion (F) protein encoded on segment 5 and haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein encoded on segment 6. However, comparision between different ISAV isolates is complicated because there is presently no universally accepted nomenclature system for designation of genetic relatedness between ISAV isolates. The first outbreak of ISA in marine-farmed Atlantic salmon in the Southern hemisphere occurred in Chile starting in June 2007. In order to describe the molecular characteristics of the virus so as to understand its origins, how ISAV isolates are maintained and spread, and their virulence characteristics, we conducted a study where the viral sequences were directly amplified, cloned and sequenced from tissue samples collected from several ISA-affected fish on the different fish farms with confirmed or suspected ISA outbreaks in Chile. This paper describes the genetic characterization {{of a large number of}} ISAV strains associated with extensive outbreaks in Chile starting in June 2007, and their phylogenetic relationships with selected European and North American isolates that are representative of the genetic diversity of <b>ISAV.</b> Results <b>RT-PCR</b> <b>for</b> <b>ISAV</b> F and HE glycoprotein genes was performed directly on tissue samples collected from ISA-affected fish on different farms among 14 fish companies in Chile during the ISA outbreaks that started in June 2007. The genes of the F and HE glycoproteins were cloned and sequenced for 51 and 78 new isolates, respectively. An extensive comparative analysis of ISAV F and HE sequence data, including reference isolates sampled from Norway, Faroe Islands, Scotland, USA, and Canada was performed. Based on phylogenetic analysis of concatenated ISAV F and HE genes of 103 individual isolates, the isolates from the ISA outbreaks in Chile grouped in their own cluster of 7 distinct strains within Genotype I (European genotype) of ISAV, with the closest relatedness to Norwegian ISAVs isolated in 1997. The phylogenetic software program, BACKTRACK, estimated the Chile isolates diverged from Norway isolates about 1996 and, therefore, had been present in Chile for some time before the recent outbreaks. Analysis of the deduced F protein sequence showed 43 of 51 Chile isolates with an 11 -amino acid insert between 265 N and 266 Q, with 100 % sequence identity with Genotype I ISAV RNA segment 2. Twenty four different HE-HPRs, including HPR 0, were detected, with HPR 7 b making up 79. 7 %. This is considered a manifestation of ISAV quasispecies HE protein sequence diversity. Conclusion Taken together, these findings suggest that the ISA outbreaks were caused by virus that was already present in Chile that mutated to new strains. This is the first comprehensive report tracing ISAV from Europe to South America. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{one-tube}} real-time reverse transcription-polymerase {{chain reaction}} (RT-PCR) using LightCycler technology and SYBR Green chemistry that quantitatively detects {{infectious salmon anaemia}} virus (ISAV) in biological samples is described. The assay utilized primers targeting ISAV RNA segment 8, with ISAV isolate U 5575 - 1 as template. The entire optimized assay, including one cycle of reverse transcription, 50 cycles of complementary DNA amplification, and data acquisition and analysis took only 80 min. The melting curve and gel electrophoresis analyses of real-time RT-PCR showed harmony with each other as a virus-specific single melting peak and {{a product of the}} expected size of 211 bp were obtained. A regression line between the mean threshold cycle (Ct) values and viral template concentrations over a 1 : 10 (5) dilution range with an r(2) value of 0. 962 and a slope of - 3. 771 indicated that the assay was highly reproducible. This assay was 100 times more sensitive than the conventional one-tube RT-PCR assay when compared on the same sample. Analysis of different tissues from fish that survived an ISAV experimental infection further confirmed that real-time RT-PCR was more sensitive than regular <b>RT-PCR</b> <b>for</b> <b>detection</b> of <b>ISAV</b> nucleic acids. Temporal analysis of ISAV-infected TO cell cultures showed that the amount of the specific viral RNA increased more than 100 -fold within 32 h post-inoculation (p. i.) and over 1200 -fold by 144 h p. i. The melting curve analysis throughout the duration of the infection sampled had a single melting peak suggesting that the virus population was uniform in the targeted region. Quantitative analysis of CHSE- 214 cell cultures infected with different ISAV isolates indicated that ISAV isolates, based on their ability to replicate and cause cytopathic effects in CHSE- 214 cells, may be differentiated into three CHSE phenotypes: replicating cytopathic, replicating non-cytopathic, and non-replicating. Thus, the SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR is a sensitive, rapid, and highly reproducible assay {{that can be used to}} quantitate ISAV in biological samples.

40|$|Infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) is the {{etiological}} {{agent of}} the disease by the same name and causes major losses in the salmon industry worldwide. Epizootic ISAV outbreaks have occurred in Norway and, to a lesser degree, in Canada. In 2007, an ISAV outbreak in Chile destroyed most of the seasonal production and endangered the entire Chilean salmon industry. None of the existing prophylactic approaches have demonstrated efficacy in providing absolute protection from or even a palliative effect on ISAV proliferation. Sanitary control measures <b>for</b> <b>ISAV,</b> based on molecular epidemiology data, have proven insufficient, mainly due to high salmon culture densities and a constant presence of a nonpathogenic strain of the virus. This report describes an alternative treatment approach based on interfering peptides selected from a phage display library. The screening of a phage display heptapeptide library resulted {{in the selection of}} a novel peptide with significant in vitro antiviral activity against ISAV. This peptide specifically interacted with the viral hemagglutinin-esterase protein, thereby impairing virus binding, with plaque reduction assays showing a significant reduction in viral yields. The identified peptide acts at micromolar concentrations against at least two different pathogenic strains of the virus, without detectable cytotoxic effects on the tested fish cells. Therefore, antiviral peptides represent a novel alternative <b>for</b> controlling <b>ISAV</b> and, potentially, other fish pathogens...|$|R

40|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{reference}} standard, a latent class model (LCM) was used in this study to assess diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) and specificity (DSp) of a recently developed reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (<b>RT-PCR)</b> <b>for</b> infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV). The study included 4 populations of Atlantic salmon, and to ensure the identifiability of the LCM, four additional detection methods were used in parallel including real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), virus isolation (VI), indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), and a lateral flow immunoassay (LFI). While a conventional LCM assumes DSe and DSp to be constant across the populations, Nérette et al. (2008) previously reported concerns about non-constant DSp of RT-PCR, which detects viral RNA from both active and inactive viral particles. It was suspected that some ISAV recovered fish may carry residual RNA and {{may be more likely to}} test positive compared to naïve fish. The various mixture distributions of the two sub-classes of non-infected fish would lead to a non-constant combined DSp estimate across populations. Within a Bayesian framework, the conventional two-class LCM was extended to three classes of infection stages (naïve non-infected, recovered non-infected carrying RNA, and infected). The resulting analysis confirmed the existence of three classes of fish with substantially different test performances <b>for</b> <b>ISAV.</b> <b>For</b> infected fish, DSe of RT-PCRs and VI approximated 90 %, and antibody based assays were the least sensitive (DSe around 65 %). Regardless of the test, the DSp estimates on naïve fish were all above 98 % with LFI being in average the most specific. Only RT-PCR and qRT-PCR tested positive with the additional class of recovered fish (DSp around 30 %). The true infectious status of this sub-class (i. e. viral RNA carriers) is debatable and requires further knowledge about ISAV infection dynamics at the fish level. Promising applications of multiple class estimates require adjustments of traditional test interpretation and further epidemiological knowledge of the infection dynamics at the population level.

40|$|Antibody {{detection}} {{tests are}} rarely used for diagnostic purposes in fish diseases. Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) caused by ISA virus (ISAV) is an emerging disease of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. The virus {{has also been}} isolated from diseased coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch in Chile. An {{indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) that should facilitate serodiagnosis of ISAV infection, the study of epidemiology, and the control of ISA in farmed fishes has been developed using purified ISAV as the coating antigen, and monoclonal antibodies that detect fish immunoglobulins bound to the antigen on the plate. Application of the test to a random sample of farmed Atlantic salmon from the Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick, Canada, positively identified 5 of the 7 ISAV RT-PCR-positive fish, and all 10 RT-PCR-negative fish were also negative in the ELISA. Some RT-PCR-negative fish had an elevated non-specific antibody reactivity suggestive of chronic infection or resistance to ISAV. This test was also able to detect 11 of the 14 coho salmon pooled serum samples from a clinically affected farm in Chile that were positive by the virus neutralization (VN) test, and 2 of the 4 VN-negative samples. We conclude that this ELISA would be suitable as a routine test <b>for</b> <b>ISAV</b> infection or <b>for</b> assessing <b>ISAV</b> vaccine efficacy before placing smolts in sea cages, and for testing fishes in sea cages to detect level of resistance to ISA. The assay enables vaccination in combination with depopulation control methods.

40|$|Infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) is the causative {{agent of}} infections in farmed Atlantic salmon. ISAV presumably {{represents}} a new genus within the Orthomyxoviridae. ISAV {{has been shown}} earlier to exhibit a receptor-destroying activity, which was defined as an acetylesterase with unknown specificity. We have analyzed the substrate specificity of the ISAV esterase in detail. Purified ISAV hydrolyzed free 5 -N-acetyl- 4 -O-acetyl neuraminic acid. In addition, the purified 9 -O-acetylated sialic acid derivative was also hydrolyzed, but at lower rates. When we used a glycosidically bound substrate, ISAV was unable to hydrolyze 9 -O-acetylated sialic acid, which represents the major substrate for the influenza C virus esterase. ISAV completely de-O-acetylated glycoprotein-bound 5 -N-acetyl- 4 -O-acetyl neuraminic acid. Thus, the enzymatic activity of the hemagglutinin-esterase of ISAV is {{comparable to that of}} the sialate- 4 -O-esterases of murine coronaviruses and related group 2 coronaviruses. In addition, we found that ISAV specifically binds to glycoproteins containing 4 -O-acetylated sialic acids.

40|$|To {{secure the}} safety of {{international}} trade of animal and their derived products, it is required that animals should be proven infection-free using a validated diagnostic test certified by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Test validation involves a multi-step evaluation process to assess test accuracy and its fitness for a specific purpose. Contrary to common understanding, diagnostic accuracy is not constant for each test and may vary within and between populations according to the distribution of biological factors that influence the pathophysiology of the disease. Diagnostic test accuracy combines the precision (repeatability & reproducibility) and the trueness of the test (diagnostic sensitivity, DSe, & specificity, DSp). The objective of this research program was to extend diagnostic test evaluation methods by estimating accuracy specifically for influential covariate factors. This research was applied to reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (<b>RT-PCR)</b> <b>for</b> infectious salmon anaemia virus (<b>ISAV).</b> Early <b>detection</b> of <b>ISAV</b> is the base of an efficient control of this devastating disease for salmon aquaculture industries. RT-PCR accuracy was shown to differ among stages of infection, revealing substantial variation of test precision across prevalences of infection stages in the tested populations. Submission factors such as homogenization and testing laboratory also significantly impacted the precison and were accounted for to predict test result agreement across prevalences. Latent Class Modeling (LCM) {{was used to evaluate}} test trueness in absence of true status information. LCM assumes that DSe & DSp are constant across populations, which was revealed as an invalid assumption. Extending to 3 -class LCM revealed different DSe between low- and high-infected salmon. Finally, the selection of the proper cutpoint for the real-time version of RT-PCR was dependent on the distribution of infection stages in the target population. Both analytical and epidemiological approaches to select the cutpoint were reviewed to improve the fit for intended purpose of the test.

40|$|Deep groundwater, even if {{generally}} protected, {{could be}} contaminated by surface or rain water infiltration through soil fractures, septic tanks, cesspits, land irrigation, disposal of wastewater {{and disposal of}} muds from depuration systems. The sanitary importance of such possible contamination {{is related to the}} different uses of the water and it is at the maximum level when it is intended for human use. Routine microbiological analyses do not consider viruses, only bacterial parameters, as contamination indicators. However, it is known the enteric viruses can survive a long time in deep aquifers and that they may not always be associated with bacterial indicators. The virological of waters intended for drinking use is provided only as an occasional control exercised at the discretion of the sanitary authority. Technological difficulties with obtaining data about groundwater viral contamination led to a study to devise rapid and efficient methods for their detection and the application of these methods to samples from different sources. Four acid nucleic extraction techniques have been tested (classic proteinase K-phenol/chloroform, QIAamp Viral RNA Kit (Qiagen), SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega) and NucleoSpin Virus L (Macherey-Nagel). Sensitivity and specificity of <b>RT-PCR</b> protocols <b>for</b> entero- (EV), hepatitis A (HAV) and small round structured (SRSV) viruses have been verified. Deep groundwater samples (100 L) were concentrated (2 -step tangential flow ultrafiltration) and the concentrate contaminated with serial 10 -fold dilutions of a known titre of poliovirus type 3. Extracted RNA was concentrated (microcon- 100) and analysed by RT-PCR using specific EV primers and visualising amplification products by agarose gel electrophoresis. In addition, two different methods of <b>RT-PCR</b> <b>for</b> non-cultivable viruses have been tested: (a) RT-PCR and nested <b>RT-PCR</b> <b>for</b> HAV and (b) RT-PCR with generic primers and RT-PCR with specific primers for SRSV. Different specificity tests have been carried out in the presence of some of the commoner microorganisms. The most efficient, sensitive and specific protocols were used to test 35 × 100 L deep groundwater samples. Sample concentrates were split with one part treated with chloroform and analysed by cell culture (BGM and Frp/ 3, derived from FrHK/ 4, cells) and the other tested by <b>RT-PCR</b> <b>for</b> HAV, EV and SRSV. Results demonstrated the high efficiency of the classic and QlAamp methods. Microcon- 100 did not increase the sensitivity of the technique used. The highest sensitivity was observed <b>for</b> <b>RT-PCR</b> with specific primers for SRSV and <b>for</b> nested <b>RT-PCR</b> <b>for</b> HAV. One sample showed a cytopathic effect, not confirmed at the third subculture, while the RT-PCR allowed the detection of echovirus 7. Cell culture did not allow detection {{of the majority of the}} enteric viruses while PCR gave sensitive, specific and rapid detection of a range of agents in the same samples. Even if it was impossible to fix a virological quality standard, it would be necessary to find a viral indicator in order to achieve a complete preventive check which would be particularly useful in some cases (e. g. water never used before, after pollution accidents, for seasonal checking) ...|$|R
40|$|STEC (Shiga toxin-producing E. coli) are {{important}} human pathogens, which can potentially cause hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). An important predictor of serious disease is {{the production of}} the variant Shiga toxin 2 (Stx 2). This thesis {{is part of a larger}} project that aims to establish a method forquantitation of stx 2 in the form of a real-time PCR assay. We conducted experiments to find optimal culture conditions, performed DNA extraction and validation of PCR results. Furthermore, we have optimized the <b>RT-PCR</b> <b>for</b> both stx 2 and the housekeeping gene tufA, and designed standard curves for calculating the efficiency of both of these. In this project we have produced experimental results which in the future can be used in the further development of an <b>RT-PCR</b> assay <b>for</b> stx 2. </p...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{testing for}} dengue virus {{is used to}} confirm the {{diagnosis}} of dengue virus infection and to differentiate dengue from other febrile tropical illnesses. There are few data on the clinical use of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (<b>RT-PCR)</b> <b>for</b> diagnosis of dengue virus infection. We prospectively evaluated 121 consecutive patients with possible dengue who had samples submitted <b>for</b> <b>RT-PCR,</b> IgM serology, and virus culture. Results were compared with the final discharge diagnosis. Semi-nested RT-PCR was performed using genus- and serotype-specific NS 3 consensus primers. Results of 112 patients were available for the final analysis. The RT-PCR was positive in 40 of 62 patients with dengue. Patients who were RT-PCR-positive alone showed a mean o...|$|R
