Of the wilayats, Seeb, {{located in}} the western section of the governorate, was the most populous (with over 220,000 residents), while Muttrah had {{the highest number of}} expatriates (with over 100,000). Approximately 71% of the population was within the 15–64 age group, with the average Omani age being 23 years. About 10% of the population is illiterate, an improvement when compared to the 18% illiteracy <b>rate</b> <b>recorded</b> during the 1993 census. Expatriates accounted for over 60% of the labour force, dominated by males, who accounted for 80% of the city's total labour. A majority of expatriates (34%) engineering-related occupations, while most Omanis worked in engineering, clerical, scientific or technical fields.

2500|$|A large {{contribution}} to the recession {{is due to the}} closure and suspension of thousands of banks across the country. The causation of these failing financial institutions come from several reasons including unregulated lending procedures, confidence in the Gold standard, consumer confidence in future economics, and agricultural defaults on outstanding loans. With these compacting issues the banking system struggled {{to keep up with the}} high demand of cash withdraws from the public. This impact overall decreased the money supply and forced the banks to result to short sale (real estate) and liquidation of existing loans. In the race to liquidate assets the banking system began to fail on a wide scale. In November 1930 the first major banking crisis begun with over 800 banks closing their doors by January 1931; over 2100 banks will be suspended by October 1931, with the highest suspension <b>rate</b> <b>recorded</b> in the St. Louis Federal Reserve District with 2 out of every 5 banks suspended. The economy in whole experienced a massive reduction in banking footholds across the country amounting to more than nine thousand closed banks by 1933.|$|E
