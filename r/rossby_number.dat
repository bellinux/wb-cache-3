25|$|The <b>Rossby</b> <b>number</b> is {{the ratio}} of {{inertial}} to Coriolis forces. A small <b>Rossby</b> <b>number</b> indicates a system is strongly affected by Coriolis forces, and a large <b>Rossby</b> <b>number</b> indicates {{a system in which}} inertial forces dominate. For example, in tornadoes, the <b>Rossby</b> <b>number</b> is large, in low-pressure systems it is low, and in oceanic systems it is around 1. As a result, in tornadoes the Coriolis force is negligible, and balance is between pressure and centrifugal forces. In low-pressure systems, centrifugal force is negligible and balance is between Coriolis and pressure forces. In the oceans all three forces are comparable.|$|E
25|$|Because the Coriolis {{force is}} relevant, it {{normally}} fits processes with small <b>Rossby</b> <b>number,</b> typically having large lengthscales.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} impact of the Coriolis effect is in the large-scale dynamics of the oceans and the atmosphere. In meteorology and oceanography, it is convenient to postulate a rotating frame of reference wherein the Earth is stationary.

Their relative importance {{is determined by the}} applicable <b>Rossby</b> <b>numbers.</b> Tornadoes have high <b>Rossby</b> <b>numbers,</b> so, while tornado-associated centrifugal forces are quite substantial, Coriolis forces associated with tornadoes are for practical purposes negligible.|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe study {{formation}} and properties of new coherent structures: ageostrophic modons in the two-layer rotating shallow water model. The ageostrophic modons are obtained by 'ageostrophic adjustment' {{of the exact}} modon solutions of the two-layer quasi-geostrophic equations with the free surface, which are used to initialize the full two-layer shallow water model. Numerical simulations are performed using a well-balanced high-resolution finite volume numerical scheme. For large enough <b>Rossby</b> <b>numbers,</b> the initial configurations undergo ageostrophic adjustment towards asymmetric ageostrophic quasi-stationary coherent dipoles. This process is accompanied by substantial emission of inertia-gravity waves. The resulting dipole is shown to be robust and survives frontal collisions. It contains captured inertia-gravity waves and, for higher <b>Rossby</b> <b>numbers</b> and weak stratification, carries a (baroclinic) hydraulic jump at its axis. For stronger stratifications and high enough <b>Rossby</b> <b>numbers,</b> 'rider' coherent structures appear {{as a result of}} adjustment, with a monopole in one layer and a dipole in another. Other ageostrophic coherent structures, such as two-layer tripoles and two-layer modons with nonlinear scatter plot, result from the collisions of ageostrophic modons. They are shown to be long-living and robust, and to capture waves. © 2012 Cambridge University Press...|$|R

40|$|Turbulent {{rotating}} convection in {{a cylinder}} is investigated both numerically and experimentally. The {{focus of this}} work is on two topics: the convective heat transfer through the fluid layer, expressed as the Nusselt number, and the domain-filling structure typical for confined convection, the so-called large-scale circulation (LSC). The presence of the LSC is addressed for several rotation rates. For sufficiently strong rotation, characterized by <b>Rossby</b> <b>numbers</b> Ro. 0. 72 no LSC is found. For larger <b>Rossby</b> <b>numbers,</b> i. e., slower rotation, a precession of the LSC in anticyclonic direction (counter to the background rotation) is appreciated. It is shown that the heat transfer has a maximal value at Ro = 0. 18 of about 20 % larger than in the non-rotating case Ro = 8. Since the LSC is no longer present at this Rossby value we conclude that it can play {{no role in the}} observed enhancement of the heat transfer.

A more correct speed would be that characteristic of the swirl fd, where f is the precession (and sound) frequency, based on the <b>Rossby</b> <b>number.</b> To test the relevance of this new characteristic speed, the flow rate was increased and the frequency and level of the sound was measured.

40|$|A linearly {{stratified}} fluid {{contained in}} a circular cylinder with a linearly-sloped base, whose axis is aligned with the rotation axis, is spun up from a rotation rate Ώ to Ώ + ΔΏ (with ΔΏ << Ώ) by Rossby waves propagating across the container. Experimental results presented here, however, show that if the Burger number S is not small, then that spinup looks quite different from that reported by Pedlosky & Greenspan [J. Fluid Mech., vol. 27, 1967, pp. 291 – 304] for S = 0. That is particularly so if the Burger number is large, since the Rossby waves are then confined to a region of height S− 1 / 2 above the sloped base. Axial vortices, ubiquitous features even at tiny <b>Rossby</b> <b>numbers</b> of spin-up in containers with vertical corners (see van Heijst et al. [Phys. Fluids A, vol. 2, 1990, pp. 150 – 159] and Munro & Foster [Phys. Fluids, vol. 26, 2014, article no. 026603], for example), are less prominent here, forming at locations that are not obvious a priori, but in the ‘western half’ of the container only, and confined to the bottom S− 1 / 2 region. Both decay rates from friction at top and bottom walls and the propagation speed of the waves are found to increase with S as well. An asymptotic theory for <b>Rossby</b> <b>numbers</b> that are not too large shows good agreement with many features seen in the experiments. The full frequency spectrum and decay rates for these waves are discussed, again for large S, and vertical vortices are found to occur only for <b>Rossby</b> <b>numbers</b> comparable to E 1 / 2, where E is the Ekman number.

2500|$|The fictitious Coriolis force, {{which is}} {{observed}} in rotational frames, is ordinarily visible only in very large-scale motion [...] like the projectile motion of long-range guns or {{the circulation of}} the Earth's atmosphere (see <b>Rossby</b> <b>number).</b> Neglecting air resistance, an object dropped from a 50-meter-high tower at the equator will fall 7.7 millimeters eastward of the spot below where it is dropped because of the Coriolis force.|$|E
2500|$|Barotropic models {{assume the}} {{atmosphere}} is nearly barotropic, {{which means that the}} direction and speed of the geostrophic wind are independent of height. [...] In other words, no vertical wind shear of the geostrophic wind. [...] It also implies that thickness contours (a proxy for temperature) are parallel to upper level height contours. [...] In this type of atmosphere, high and low pressure areas are centers of warm and cold temperature anomalies. [...] Warm-core highs (such as the subtropical ridge and Bermuda-Azores high) and cold-core lows have strengthening winds with height, with the reverse true for cold-core highs (shallow arctic highs) and warm-core lows (such as tropical cyclones). A barotropic model tries to solve a simplified form of atmospheric dynamics {{based on the assumption that}} {{the atmosphere is}} in geostrophic balance; that is, that the <b>Rossby</b> <b>number</b> of the air in the atmosphere is small. If the assumption is made that the atmosphere is divergence-free, the curl of the Euler equations reduces into the barotropic vorticity equation. This latter equation can be solved over a single layer of the atmosphere. Since the atmosphere at a height of approximately [...] is mostly divergence-free, the barotropic model best approximates the state of the atmosphere at a geopotential height corresponding to that altitude, which corresponds to the atmosphere's [...] pressure surface.|$|E

Resulting dynamics in the surface layers involve large <b>Rossby</b> <b>numbers</b> and significant vortical asymmetries. Furthermore, the ageostrophic divergent motions associated with small-scale surface frontogenesis are shown to significantly alter the nonlinear transfers of kinetic energy and consequently the time evolution of the surface dynamics.

However, despite this strong ageostrophic character, some of the main surface properties are surprisingly still close to the surface quasigeostrophic equilibrium. They include a noticeable shallow (�k � 2) velocity spectrum as well as a conspicuous local spectral relationship between surface kinetic energy, sea surface height, and density variance over a large range of scales (from 400 to 4 km).
