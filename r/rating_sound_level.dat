Criteria of railway noise assessment are considered {{in accordance with}} standards to be entered into last years in Russia and taking into account less harmful character of railway noise in comparison with noise {{of other types of}} transport. On an example it is shown that such approach leads to essential reduction (more than by 10 dB) of noise indicator as equivalent rating pressure levels in comparison with such levels created by separate trains on the same distance.

40|$|Various {{procedures}} for rating total annoyance caused by different environmental sounds have been proposed. It is {{explained that the}} adequacy of the majority of these models is very limited. A more promising weighted summation model is described in which for each single source in the combination, the sound exposure will be first expressed as the level of equally annoying road-traffic sound. Next, weighted summation of the adjusted levels results in the total <b>rating</b> <b>sound</b> <b>level.</b> The model successfully explained total annoyance ratings obtained in the laboratory for various combinations of different simultaneously presented sounds. To explore the general applicability of the model, suggestions for additional research are given...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} study on the annoyance caused by {{a great variety of}} shooting sounds [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 109, 244 - 253 (2001) ], it was shown that the annoyance, as rated indoors with the windows closed, could be adequately predicted from the outdoor A-weighted and C-weighted sound-exposure levels [ASEL (L(AE)) and CSEL (L(CE)) ] of the impulse sounds. The explained variance in the mean ratings by (outdoor) ASEL was significantly increased by adding the product (L(CE) - L(AE)) (L(AE)) as a second variable. In the present study it was investigated to which extent the additional contribution of the second predictor is also relevant for facade attenuation types with lower and higher degrees of sound isolation than applied previously. Twenty subjects rated the indoor annoyance caused by 11 different impulse types produced by firearms ranging in caliber from 7. 62 to 155 mm, at various levels and for five facade attenuation conditions. The effect of facade attenuation on the ratings was large and consistent. In all conditions, an optimal prediction of the annoyance was obtained with outdoor ASEL as the first, and (L(CE) - L(AE)) (L(AE)) as the second predictor. The benefit of the second predictor, expressed as the increase in the explained variance, ranged from 2. 5 to 55 percent points, and strongly increased with the degree of facade attenuation. It was concluded that for the determination of the <b>rating</b> <b>sound</b> <b>level,</b> the acoustic parameters ASEL and CSEL are very powerful. In addition, the results showed that for the whole set of impulses included, the annoyance could also be predicted very well by the weighted sum of indoor ASEL and the product (L(CE) - L(AE)) (L(AE)).

50|$|The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) {{requires}} that all feasible engineering and administrative controls {{be employed to}} reduce miners' exposure levels to 90 dBA TWA. The action level for enrollment in a hearing conservation program is 85 dBA 8-hour TWA, integrating all <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> between 80 dBA to at least 130 dBA. MSHA uses a 5-dB exchange <b>rate</b> (the <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> in decibels {{that would result in}} halving an increase in <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> or a doubling a decrease.in <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> the allowable exposure time to maintain the same noise dose).

Miners may not be exposed to sounds exceeding 115 dBA with or without hearing protection devices. MSHA defines a standard threshold shift as an average decrease in auditory sensitivity of 10 dB HL at the frequencies 2,000, 3,000, and 4,000 Hz. (30 CFR Part 62).|$|R
40|$|In the densely {{populated}} area of the Netherlands, {{the objective of the}} Netherlands Ministry of Defence is to find an optimal balance between military training and the impact on the surrounding civilian community. A special case concerns large weapons, such as artillery or demolitions, which create high-energy blast waves. These waves have a low frequency content, typically between 15 and 125 Hz, and can propagate over large distances. As a result it is a relative important cause for annoyance. The challenge is to determine accurately the acoustic source strength. This source is then used in a dedicated model for military training facilities, to calculate <b>rating</b> <b>sound</b> <b>levels</b> around the facility for different training situations and to calculate the effect of measures. This model uses a linear sound propagation and an equivalent linear source strength. The source strength is measured at a large distance, where the sound propagates linearly. As a consequence the ground and the meteorology have an important effect, and one has to correct for it. A more efficient approach has been tested, where the sound pressure measurements have been performed close to the source, at typically less than 10 meters distance. The linear source strength is then calculated by applying a non-linear propagation model. The results are compared to the conventional measurement method. Another advantage of applying the non-linear model, and the nonlinear source strength, is that the effect of mitigation measures close to the source can be determined...|$|R
40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study was designed}} in which the annoyance was investigated for 14 different impulse sound types produced by various firearms ranging in caliber from 7. 62 to 155 mm. Sixteen subjects rated the annoyance for the simulated conditions of (1) being outdoors, and (2) being indoors with the windows closed. In the latter case, a representative outdoor-to-indoor reduction in sound level was applied. It was anticipated that the presumed additional annoyance caused by the heaviness of the impulse sounds might be predicted from {{the difference between the}} C-weighted sound exposure level (CSEL;LCE) and the A-weighted sound exposure level (ASEL; LAE). In the outdoor rating conditions, the annoyance was almost entirely determined by ASEL. The explained variance, r 2, in the mean ratings by ASEL was 0. 95. In the indoor rating conditions, however, the explained variance in the annoyance ratings by (outdoor) ASEL was significantly increased from r 2 = 0. 87 to r 2 = 0. 97 by adding the product (LCE 2 LAE) (LAE 2 a) as a second variable. In combination with a 12 -dB adjustment for small firearms, the present results showed that for the entire set of impulse sounds rated indoors with windows closed, the <b>rating</b> <b>sound</b> <b>level,</b> Lr, is given by Lr 5 LAE + 12 dB 1 +beta(LCE-LAE) (LAE-alpha), with alpha= 45 dB and beta = 0. 015 dB- 1. For the outdoor rating condition, the optimal parameter values were equal to alpha= 57 dB and, again, beta= 0. 015 dB- 1. In validation studies, in which the effects of the present rating procedure will be ce compared to field data, it has to be determined to what extent the constants a and b have to be adjusted.

40|$|Objective: One {{can easily}} {{recognize}} the musical {{style of a}} singer by listening to his/her sung performance. Several acoustical parameters of the Western operatic singing technique have been studied. However, the number of parameters could be extended {{and the effect of}} melody on these parameters remains unclear. By observing the effects of melody and technique on acoustical and musical parameters of the singing voice, this study aims at further characterizing the Western operatic singing technique. Methods: Fifty professional singers performed two contrasting melodies (popular song and romantic melody) with two vocal techniques (with and without operatic singing technique). The common quality parameters (energy distribution, vibrato rate and extent), perturbation parameters (standard deviation of the fundamental frequency, signal-to-noise ratio, jitter and shimmer) and musical features (fundamental frequency of the starting note, average tempo, and <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level)</b> of the 200 sung performances were analyzed. Results: The results show that the choice of melody had a limited impact on the acoustical and musical parameters observed, whereas a particular vocal profile appeared depending on the vocal technique employed. By examining these parameters in a theoretical model, this study highlights the relevance of vibrato <b>rate,</b> <b>sound</b> <b>level,</b> energy distribution, fundamental frequency of the starting note and tempo in describing the Western operatic singing technique. Conclusions: This study confirms that vocal technique affects most of the parameters examined and that the effect of melody is limited. In addition, the observation of quality and musical parameters contributes {{to a better understanding of}} the operatic singing technique. Conversely, the perturbation parameters don’t seem to take part in the characterization of operatic singing voices. Although the suggested theoretical model needs to be further developed in future research, it already generates implications for research and teaching. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Information {{about the}} age of the speaker is always present in speech. It is used as perceptual cues to age by human listeners, and can be {{measured}} acoustically and used by automatic age estimators. This chapter offers an introduction to the phonetic study of speaker age, with focus on what is known about the acoustic features which vary with age. The age-related acoustic variation in temporal as well as in laryngeally and supralaryngeally conditioned aspects of speech has been well doc-umented. For example, features related to speech <b>rate,</b> <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level</b> (SPL) and fundamental frequency (F 0) have been studied exten-sively, and appear to be important correlates of speaker age. However, the relationships among the correlates appear to be rather complex, and are influenced by several factors. For instance, differences have been re-ported between correlates of female and male age, between speakers of good and poor physiological condition, between chronological age and perceived age, and also between different speech sample types (e. g. sus-tained vowels, read or spontaneous speech). More research is thus needed in order to build reliable automatic classifiers of speaker age...|$|R

Six professional singers volunteered to sing excerpts from two songs {{pertaining to the}} musical theater and to the soul styles of singing.

As compared with musical theater, the soul style was characterized by significantly higher subglottal pressure and maximum flow declination <b>rate.</b> Yet <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level</b> was lower, suggesting higher glottal resistance. The differences would be the effects of firmer glottal adduction and a greater frequency separation between the first formant and its closest spectrum partial in soul than in musical theater...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. An experiment by the Naval Postgraduate School and the National Data Buoy Center {{was performed in}} the Gulf of Mexico to investigate the underwater sound generated by heavy precipitation {{under a variety of}} conditons. During the first stage of the experiment, nine data sets were obtained with rainfall rates up to 300 mm/hr. The characteristic fifteen kilohertz peak in the underwater sound spectrum generated by small raindrops in light rain is absent during heavy rain. These data sets show a good correlation between rainfall <b>rate</b> and underwater <b>sound</b> <b>levels,</b> suggesting that acoustical measurement of rainfall rate at sea is possible. The correlation is best at lower frequencies (2 - 10 kHz). At higher frequencies (12 - 22 kI-Iz) low spectral levels are observed in conditions of high wind (> 10 ns), presumably due to sound absorption by ambient bubble clouds from breaking waves. At very high rainfall rates (> 200 mm/hr), low levels at higher frequencies are also observed suggesting that the rain itself is capable of producing large populations of bubbles which absorb the sound radiated from the surface.

40|$|In {{this report}} {{the effects of}} using {{sonification}} when performing move- ments in 3 D space are explored. User studies were performed where partic- ipants had to repeatedly move their hand toward a target. Three different sonification modes were tested where the fundamental frequency, <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> and <b>sound</b> <b>rate</b> were varied respectively depending on {{the distance to the}} target. The results show that there is no statistically significant performance increase for any sonification mode. There is however an in- dication that sonification increases the interaction speed for some users. The mode which provided the greatest average performance increase was when the <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> was varied. This mode gave a 7 % average speed increase over the silent control mode. However, the <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> mode has some significant drawbacks, especially the very high base volume re- quirement, which might not make it the best suited sonification mode for all applications. In the general case we instead recommend using the sonification mode that varies the <b>sound</b> <b>rate,</b> which gave a slightly lower performance gain but can be played at a lower volume due to its binary nature. ...|$|R

40|$|The Murdoch University Internship Program is one {{in which}} {{students}} obtain valuable work experience in various actions such as engineering project management and engineering practice. The City of Rockingham has had a long relationship with the Murdoch University Internship Program and has hosted an intern every year since 2004. The 2010 / 2011 internship reported herein was one in which the main aims were to be the assessment of the small wind turbine generator to be installed at the Lark Hill Sportsplex at Port Kennedy. The installation was supposed to be performed through August of 2010, which would have coincided well with the beginning of the Semester 2 internship period. Due to various delays outside the control of the intern, the City and the University, the turbine was not installed until March of 2011 and as of the 17 th of June 2011 was still not approved for grid connection. In hindsight the assessments of the Lark Hill turbine should have been abandoned sooner however, the installation contractor appeared to evade timeline related queries and information was supplied in small measures. This resulted in the gradual extension of timelines for the assessments rather than the altering of project aims to achieve different outcomes. The assessments were instead performed on the A 1 turbine that was undergoing testing by NSWTC. Using data collected by the staff the assessments were performed following the same international standards.

There were three experiments conducted: a soundwalk in situ in Manchester (United Kingdom) city centre, listening tests in Salford (United Kingdom), and listening tests in Bandung (Indonesia). The listening tests used material recorded from four locations on the soundwalk route in Manchester. The Salford listening tests were performed at the in-situ measured <b>sound</b> <b>level,</b> and {{the participants were asked to}} adjust the <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> to the level that represents actual locations. The listening test in Bandung was conducted to understand the effect of participants who never come to the actual location to the perception of soundscape and the <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> adjustment. The listening tests in Bandung were conducted at the in situ <b>sound</b> <b>level,</b> at 9. 5 dB below the in situ <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> (based on the preference <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> from the experiment in Salford), and the participants were also requested to adjust the <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> to the level that represents the actual space (to examine the consistency with the experiment in Salford).
