5|$|In {{the early}} morning of February 25, 1990, Terri Schiavo {{collapsed}} in a hallway of her St. Petersburg, Florida apartment. Firefighters and paramedics, arriving in response to her husband Michael's 9-1-1 call, found her face-down and unconscious. She was not breathing and had no pulse. They attempted to <b>resuscitate</b> {{her and she was}} transported to the Humana Northside Hospital. Paramedics had her intubated and ventilated.|$|E
5|$|In November 1990, Michael Schiavo took Terri to the University of California, San Francisco for {{experimental}} nerve stimulation with a thalamic stimulator. The treatment took several months and was unsuccessful. He returned to Florida {{with her in}} January 1991 and admitted her as an inpatient to the Mediplex Rehabilitation Center in Bradenton, Florida. On July 19, 1991, Terri Schiavo {{was transferred to the}} Sabal Palms Skilled Care Facility, where she received neurological testing and regular speech and occupational therapy until 1994. In mid-1993, Michael Schiavo requested a do not <b>resuscitate</b> order for her after she contracted a urinary tract infection.|$|E

30|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the performance of}} our prototype in a rodent model of haemorrhagic shock. After haemorrhagic shock, rats were randomized to five experimental groups: three were <b>resuscitated</b> with fluid and two with co-administration of fluid and norepinephrine. Among groups <b>resuscitated</b> with fluid, one was <b>resuscitated</b> by a physician and two were <b>resuscitated</b> according to two different closed-loop algorithms. Among groups <b>resuscitated</b> with fluid and norepinephrine, one was <b>resuscitated</b> by a physician {{and the other one}} by the closed-loop device. The precision of arterial pressure during the resuscitation period was assessed using rising time, time passed in the target area and performance error calculations.|$|R
30|$|Groups <b>resuscitated</b> with fluid {{had similar}} {{performances}} and passed {{as much time}} in the target area of 80 – 90  mmHg as the manual group [manual: 76.8 % (67.9 – 78.2), closed-loop: 64.6 % (45.7 – 72.9) and 80.9 % (59.1 – 85.3)]. Rats <b>resuscitated</b> with fluid and norepinephrine using closed-loop passed similar time in target area than manual group [closed-loop: 74.4 % (58.4 – 84.5) vs. manual: 60.1 % (46.1 – 72.4)] but had shorter rising time to reach target area [160  s (106 – 187) vs. 434  s (254 – 1081)] than those <b>resuscitated</b> by a physician. Rats <b>resuscitated</b> with co-administration of fluid and norepinephrine required less fluid and had less hemodilution than rats <b>resuscitated</b> with fluid alone. Lactate decrease was similar between groups <b>resuscitated</b> with fluid alone and fluid with norepinephrine.|$|R

5|$|Two {{incidents}} {{occurred during}} filming. On the first, seven bullet holes were shot {{into one of}} the trucks used during production. On the second, the cast and crew were driving from the set, and a pedestrian was shot in the neck outside a supermarket. The ambulance took 35–45 minutes to arrive, and waited a further 35–45 minutes for the police to arrive. The paramedics refused to take the victim to the hospital without a police escort. According to Stevenson, there was a possibility that rival gangmembers would shoot at the paramedics for trying to <b>resuscitate</b> the victim.|$|E
5|$|With {{approximately}} {{two minutes of}} normal time left, the referee's whistle blew for an infringement. Stein however appeared {{to think that the}} final whistle had been blown, as he rose from his seat and began to make his way towards the Welsh bench to shake hands with England. However, as he got up, he then fell to his knees before collapsing to the ground. He was immediately carried to the stadium's medical room where attempts were made to <b>resuscitate</b> him.|$|E
5|$|Back on the highway, an {{ambulance}} crew try to <b>resuscitate</b> Black, {{who has been}} outside his car through the night after his vision of Lee. After he comes to, he realizes this alternate reality was Lee showing him a life without the Millennium Group. However, he is left unsure whether his role within the Group is protecting his family from evil, or exposing them to it. Black seeks out Lee in a refugee camp; meanwhile, Law and his crewmen are also tracking her, conspiring to kill her to avenge their fellow crew. Lee turns the men against each other with her visions, before Black arrives to rescue her. As Black questions her as to the Group's influence, she resumes speaking in her unknown tongue, leaving Black without the answer he seeks.|$|E
30|$|Aspirin- and P 2 Y 12 -mediated {{platelet}} inhibition is impaired in <b>resuscitated</b> {{patients treated}} with therapeutic hypothermia. There are {{no significant differences}} between the three P 2 Y 12 inhibitors in hypothermic patients, whereas the newer inhibitors are more potent under normothermic conditions but do show slightly weaker inhibition in <b>resuscitated</b> patients. Potentially, intravenous aspirin and intravenous P 2 Y 12 inhibitors might still supply an even more predictable and stable platelet inhibition; however, no data in <b>resuscitated</b> patients are available, yet.|$|R
40|$|The {{pathogenicity}} of nonstressed, heat-stressed, and <b>resuscitated</b> {{cells of}} Listeria monocytogenes 1 A 1 was assayed in immunocompromised mice. Cells were stressed by heating them at 56 degrees C for 20 min and were <b>resuscitated</b> by incubation in tryptic soy broth at 25 degrees C. A dose of 10 (2) nonstressed and <b>resuscitated</b> cells per mouse {{was required for}} pathogenicity; a dose of 10 (4) heat-stressed cells per mouse was considerably less pathogenic.

5|$|During {{the night}} of 26 September 2016, Pascu's wife called the {{emergency}} number (112) twice. The first time the artist complained about a panic attack and a 3 days lasting insomnia. The ambulance doctor reported that the patient didn't mention previous illness history (namely his previous stroke), he only mentioned his diabetes and his knee pain that prevented him from sleep. Pascu refused hospitalization. His only request was to be administrated something {{in order to get}} some sleep, and the doctor gave him Diazepam. A second call followed a couple of hours later; this time Pascu was unconscious. Doctors tried to <b>resuscitate,</b> but to no avail. It was determined that Pascu died due to a heart attack.|$|E
5|$|For {{some days}} Hendrix {{had been in}} poor health, {{due in part to}} fatigue caused by overworking, a chronic lack of sleep, and an illness assumed to be influenza-related. Insecurities about his {{personal}} relationships and disillusionment with the music industry had also contributed to his frustration. Although the details of his final hours and death are disputed, Hendrix spent much of his last day with Monika Dannemann. During the morning of September18, she found him unresponsive in her apartment at the Samarkand Hotel, 22Lansdowne Crescent, Notting Hill. She called for an ambulance at 11:18a.m., and he was taken to St Mary Abbot's Hospital where an attempt was made to <b>resuscitate</b> him. He was pronounced dead at 12:45p.m.|$|E
5|$|I was to {{keep the}} fish before me in a tin tray, and {{occasionally}} moisten the surface with alcohol from the jar... In ten minutes I had seen all that could be seen in that fish, and started in search of the Professor – who had, however, left the Museum; and when I returned, after lingering over some of the odd animals stored in the upper apartment, my specimen was dry all over. I dashed the fluid over the fish as if to <b>resuscitate</b> the beast from a fainting fit, and looked with anxiety for a return of the normal sloppy appearance. This little excitement over, nothing was done but to return to a steadfast gaze at my mute companion.|$|E

5|$|That night, FBI agents wait at {{the concert}} hall for Barnett's arrival. Barnett, who goes {{completely}} unseen due to his youthful appearance, poses as a piano tuner. He shoots Scully in the chest during the recital and then flees, taking the cellist hostage. Mulder doesn't hesitate this time around and fires at Barnett, fatally wounding him. Scully is revealed to have survived the attack, having worn a bullet-proof vest. Despite the efforts of doctors and a mysterious CIA agent to <b>resuscitate</b> Barnett, he dies, and takes the secrets of Ridley's research to the grave. The episode ends with the camera zooming in on locker number 935 in a train station, implying the secrets along with Barnett's precaution, a bomb, are contained within and one day will be discovered.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{finds the}} spaceship's crew long dead from {{exposure}} to a human virus. The trio then discover a sickbay where Avery's entire crew, Toby, and Rory are in medical care along with the TARDIS. The Siren {{turns out to be}} the ship's virtual doctor, caring for the injured humans; the black spots are tissue samples used as references. Amy convinces the Siren to release Rory into her care. Using Rory's nursing knowledge, Amy and the Doctor remove him from life support and are able to <b>resuscitate</b> him. Meanwhile, Avery decides to stay with his son and his crew, unable to go back to England himself while the ship will care for his crew. Avery takes the helm of the spaceship and, along with Toby and his crew, sets off to explore the stars.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{report on}} the {{accident}} noted, but did not criticise, the medical operation at the scene. It described how paramedics attended {{to those who were}} conscious with life-threatening injuries, but did not make any attempts to <b>resuscitate</b> victims who appeared drowned or lacked vital signs because they believed that they could not be revived because they had succumbed to the cold salt water. It was estimated by the authorities who attended the scene of the crash that 15 ambulances responded to the accident site, all of which were used to transport the injured to hospitals, and that 40 additional ambulances were available near the site of the crash, but were not needed.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} three {{resuscitation}} fluids, hydroxyethyl starch (HES), Haemaccel, and fresh autologous blood, on reticuloendothelial system phagocytic and catabolic functions {{and resistance to}} infection after 40 % hemorrhages in BALB/c mice were studied. The mice, anesthetized with isoflurane, were bled over a 10 -min period, left hypovolemic for 30 min, and then <b>resuscitated</b> with their shed blood or the same volume of asanguineous fluid. Normothermia was maintained throughout the experiments. The uptake and catabolism of intravenously injected double-labelled sheep erythrocytes (51 Cr- 125 I-SRBC) in liver and spleen were determined at 1 and 48 h after hemorrhage. No {{significant changes in the}} uptake or catabolism of SRBC in liver or spleen were found at 1 h after hemorrhage and resuscitation with any of the fluids. However, at 48 h a significant increase in liver uptake of SRBC was seen in animals <b>resuscitated</b> with either Haemaccel or HES compared to that in animals <b>resuscitated</b> with shed blood or in animals subjected to a sham operation. The increase in liver uptake was accompanied by a small decrease in spleen uptake in animals <b>resuscitated</b> with Haemaccel but not with HES. No great changes in catabolic activity were seen at 48 h, although activity levels tended to be higher in animals <b>resuscitated</b> with Haemaccel. Separate groups of animals were challenged by an intraperitoneal injection with live Escherichia coli at 1 or 48 h after hemorrhage and resuscitation. Sixty-four percent of the animals <b>resuscitated</b> with shed blood survived the challenge with E. coli at 1 h after hemorrhage, whereas only 10 and 0 % survival was seen for animals <b>resuscitated</b> with Haemaccel and HES, respectively. At 48 h survival was 80 % for shed-blood-resuscitated animals and 60 and 70 % for Haemaccel- and HES-resuscitated animals, respectively...|$|R
5|$|The Suvla landing was {{reinforced}} {{by the arrival of}} the British 53rd and 54th Divisions along with the British 10th Division from Kitchener's New Army divisions plus the dismounted yeomanry of the 2nd Mounted Division. The unfortunate 29th Division was also shifted from Helles to Suvla for one more push. The final British attempt to <b>resuscitate</b> the offensive came on 21 August with attacks at Scimitar Hill and Hill 60. Control of these hills would have united the Anzac and Suvla fronts, but neither battle achieved success. When fighting at Hill 60 ceased on 29 August, the battle for the Sari Bair heights, and indeed the battle for the peninsula, was effectively over.|$|E

5|$|The Enterprise {{receives}} a distress signal from a shuttlecraft returning Deanna Troi from a conference. They {{find that the}} shuttle has crashed on a desolate planet, Vagra II, and while they can find the life signs of Troi and the pilot, {{they are unable to}} beam the two to the ship. An away team beams down and discovers an animated pool of a tar-like substance, a malevolent life form that calls itself Armus. When Lt. Yar attempts to approach the shuttle, Armus hurls her back with a psychokinetic blast, killing her instantly. The away team is brought back to the Enterprise but the damage to Yar is too great for Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) to repair, and they are unable to <b>resuscitate</b> her. A second away team is sent to the planet. Armus taunts the crew members and maintains his grasp of the shuttle. During this time, Troi has communicated with Armus and learned that it is a physical manifestation of evil from the bodies of an ancient race, abandoned on Vagra II.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Survivors of {{a cardiac}} arrest often have {{persistent}} cardiovascular derangements following cardiopulmonary resuscitation including decreased cardiac output, arrhythmias and morphological myocardial damage. These cardiovascular derangements {{may lead to}} an increased susceptibility towards the external and internal environment of the cardiovascular system {{as compared to the}} healthy situation. Methods Here we tested the hypothesis that the cardiovascular system in healthy rats and rats <b>resuscitated</b> from a cardiac arrest may be differentially affected by a transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 agonist, by continuous intravenous infusion of dihydrocapsaicin (DHC). Results Compared to baseline, infusion of DHC caused an initial increase in mean arterial blood pressure in both healthy and <b>resuscitated</b> rats of 25 % and 10 %, respectively. Also, we observed an initial response of tachycardia in both healthy and <b>resuscitated</b> rats of 30 % and 20 %, respectively. Then, at high levels of DHC infusion (> 2. 0 mg/kg/hr) we observed two single episodes of transient bradycardia and hypotension in 33 % of the healthy rats, which was consistent with a TRPV 1 agonist induced Bezold-Jarisch reflex. In contrast, in <b>resuscitated</b> rats we observed multiple episodes of bradycardia/hypotension in 100 % of the rats and at a dose of DHC of 0. 65 mg/kg/hr. Notably, this DHC effect could be completely blocked in the <b>resuscitated</b> rats by pre-treatment with atropine, a muscarinic acetylcholine antagonist. Conclusions Our results indicate that the susceptibility of the rats towards TRPV 1 agonist induced Bezold-Jarisch reflex is increased in those <b>resuscitated</b> from cardiac arrest compared to the healthy situation. </p...|$|R
5|$|The old man kills Dr. Yonechi (Hiro Kanagawa), a Japanese researcher, by {{pricking}} {{him with}} a metallic stylus, introducing an unknown chemical into his body. The agents approach Nichols' girlfriend and colleague, Lisa Ianelli (Susan Lee Hoffman), who recognizes the chemical compound as a rapid freezing agent that Jason had been engineering for years. However, she claims that the compound {{has not yet been}} invented and that if Yonechi was injected with the chemical, he may not be dead. With Lisa's help, Scully and a team of medical personnel successfully <b>resuscitate</b> Yonechi, only for his body temperature to rapidly increase until he bursts into flames. Police receive a tip that the old man is living at a nearby hotel. Inside the old man's room, the agents discover a faded color photograph picturing Jason, Yonechi and Lisa toasting champagne glasses in the cryology lab. Mulder realizes from the picture that the old man is a time traveller who is attempting to alter that future, and that he is none other than Jason Nichols.|$|E
5|$|At the time, much of {{the rural}} ricelands had been {{abandoned}} due to war and lay fallow. The Americans pressured Diem to assume control of such lands and distribute it to the new settlers and {{to allow them to}} start their new lives and ease the overcrowding in the camps, but no action was taken in 1954. At the time, there was a severe wastage of personnel due to the placement of refugees in land that was inappropriate to them. Vietnamese officials had resolved to place the settlers in land similar to their northern origins so that they could be productive, but bureaucratic difficulties hampered COMIGAL and no plan was produced. Throughout 1954, 60% of the new arrivals identified themselves as having an agrarian background, but only 20% of the total refugees were placed in arable farming areas, meaning that at least 40% of the northerners were in areas not appropriate for their skill set. There were also severe problems in finding and then distributing farming equipment to the northerners so that they could get to work and <b>resuscitate</b> the agricultural sector that was hindered by the war.|$|E
