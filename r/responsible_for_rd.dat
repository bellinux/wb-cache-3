30|$|DVC-BPSI vs. DVC-MCFI - For {{the video}} {{sequences}} adopted, the proposed DVC-BPSI codec always outperforms the state-of-the-art DVC-MCFI codec. In fact, the DVC-BPSI codec shows gains up to 0.66  dB (maximum) and 0.49  dB (in terms of BD-PSNR) {{in comparison with}} DVC-MCFI for the Mobile and Calendar video sequence. Even for the Hall Monitor low-motion video sequence, where no significant deformations are available, some RD gains were obtained, notably 0.12  dB in terms of BD-PSNR. The perspective motion model used for the BPSI creation process is the main <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the <b>RD</b> performance gains since all the remaining techniques are kept the same. Thus, these RD performance results {{in the context of}} DVC codecs validate the assumption that perspective motion models can more accurately represent the motion in a video sequence. Generally, video sequences with complex camera motion (such as Mobile and Calendar, and Bus) can be better characterized with more complex motion models, and thus, higher RD performance gains can be obtained.|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} the {{spatial and temporal}} variability of Salmonella enterica in urban and rural streams in a model watershed (Grand River watershed, Ontario, Canada), and examines the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and genetic diversity of various serotypes. Using a swab collection method and various media types, Salmonella were detected in 78. 4 % of samples between November 2003 and July 2005. A diverse range of Salmonella serotypes (n= 38) were isolated from water. Predominant serotypes and phagetypes (PT), including S. Typhimurium PT 104 and S. Heidelberg PT 19, {{and the proportion of}} isolates demonstrating AMR (33 %), was similar to those for humans and farm animals locally and across Canada, a trend not commonly reported. There was a greater diversity of serotypes and AMR profiles in isolates from the urban stream compared to the rural/agricultural streams. Plasmid-borne resistance was observed in 28. 6 % of AMR isolates, with two different plasmids <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> resistance; the TEM- 1 plasmid (8. 1 Kb plasmids carrying blaTEM- 1, <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> ampicillin resistance) and CMY- 2 plasmid (95. 5 Kb plasmids carrying blaCMY- 2, <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> 3 <b>rd</b> generation cephalosporin resistance). CMY- 2 plasmids were only found in the urban stream and did not create a biological burden under non-selective conditions, indicating the long-term permanence of these plasmids. Seasonal differences in the overall diversity of serotypes and predominance of serotypes of human health significance (S. Typhimurium and S. Heidelberg) were observed. The lower occurrence of S. Typhimurium and S. Heidelberg in February and March was not the result of lower survival of these serotypes at low temperatures. Peaks in occurrence of S. Typhimurium and S. Heidelberg in the summer and spring, respectively, were pronounced in the rural/agricultural streams, as opposed to the urban stream. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and plasmid-typing revealed diversity within multiple drug resistant S. Typhimurium PT 104 isolates, indicating genetic differences among tributaries. The ubiquitous nature of Salmonella in water and the predominance of serotypes/phagetypes of human or veterinary health significance suggest that environmental exposure through consumption or contact with contaminated water is plausible. These streams may act as a vehicle for the dissemination of these organisms and their resistance genes between different hosts or environments...|$|R

40|$|A {{simple system}} using tritium {{counting}} and thermal desorption techniques {{was developed to}} measure tritium adsorption and/or absorption on/in materials having non-cleaned surfaces and to estimate the tritium inventory/contamination of materials near typical conditions. The samples comprised the materials used for conventional vacuum systems. Ad/absorption tritium could be detected as RD (room temperature desorption), SR (surface residuum) and HD (high temperature desorption) species. With respect to organic polymers, only HT molecules dissolved in the samples were <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the <b>RD,</b> SR and HD. As for other materials, however, the RD species was revealed to be physically adsorbed HTO. The HD species formed a peak at about 460 K for each material except organic polymers. It {{appeared to be a}}dsorbed tritium, but desorbed as a condensable gas at liquid nitrogen temperature. It was, however, not soluble in water. Its chemical forms and formation mechanisms were left as open question. The SR species appeared {{to be a part of}} HD. The order of adsorption amounts was as follows: [Epoxy resin, FRP (Fiber reinforced plastics) ] > [Ni (Nickel) ] > [Cr (Chromium), Fe (Iron), SS 304 (Stainless steel), A 2219 (Aluminum alloy) ] > [h-BN (Boron nitride), SiC (Silicon carbide), ASS (SS 304 passivated by anodic oxidation layers), BSS (SS 304 passivated by h-BN segregation layers) ]. This order was considerably different from that observed for clean surfaces. In addition, the adsorption amounts for metals/alloy were about two orders of magnitude smaller than those reported for clean metal surfaces. This discrepancy in results in apparently due to the presence of oxides and contamination layers over the samples used. Nevertheless, it was found that the passivation of SS 304 with anodic oxidation and/or h-BN segregation layers should be quite valid to decrease the tritium inventory and/or contamination on/of the material walls of tritium handling systems...|$|R

Hospital admissions <b>for</b> <b>RD</b> including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and pneumonia, and ambient air pollution data levels for Kaohsiung were obtained for the period from 2006 to 2010. The relative risk of hospital admissions <b>for</b> <b>RD</b> was estimated using a case-crossover approach, controlling for weather variables, day of the week, seasonality, and long-term time trends. For the single pollutant model (without adjustment for other pollutants), increased rate of admissions <b>for</b> <b>RD</b> were significantly associated with higher coarse PM levels only on cool days (< 25 °C), with a 10 µg/m 3 elevation in PM 2. 5 – 10 concentrations associated with a 3 % (95 % CI = 1 %– 5 %) rise in COPD admissions, 4 % (95 % CI = 1 %– 7 %) increase in asthma admissions, and 3 % (95 % CI = 2 %– 4 %) rise in pneumonia admissions. No significant associations were found between coarse particle levels and the number of hospital admissions <b>for</b> <b>RD</b> on warm days. In the two-pollutant models, PM 2. 5 – 10 levels remained significantly correlated with higher rate of RD admissions even controlling for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, or ozone on cool days.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{prevalence}} of reflux {{in the deep}} and superficial venous systems in the Edinburgh population {{and the relationship between}} patterns of reflux and the presence of venous disease on clinical examination were studied. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was done on men and women ranging in age from 18 to 64 years, randomly selected from 12 general practices. The presence of varicose veins and chronic venous insufficiency was noted on clinical examination, as was the duration of venous reflux by means of duplex scanning in 8 vein segments on each leg. Results were compared using cut-off points <b>for</b> reflux duration (<b>RD)</b> of 0. 5 seconds or more (RD ≥ 0. 5) and more than 1. 0 second (RD > 1. 0) to define reflux. Results: There were 1566 study participants, 867 women and 699 men. The {{prevalence of}} reflux was similar in the right and left legs. The proportion of participants with reflux was highest in the lower thigh long saphenous vein (LSV) segment (18. 6 % in the right leg and 17. 5 % in the left leg <b>for</b> <b>RD</b> ≥ 0. 5), followed by the above knee popliteal segments (12. 3 % in the right leg and 11. 0 % in the left leg <b>for</b> <b>RD</b> ≥ 0. 5), the below knee popliteal (11. 3 % in the right leg and 9. 5 % in the left leg <b>for</b> <b>RD</b> ≥ 0. 5), upper LSV (10. 0 % in the right leg and 10. 8 % in the left leg <b>for</b> <b>RD</b> ≥ 0. 5) segments, the common femoral vein segments (7. 8 % in the right leg and 8. 0 % in the left leg <b>for</b> <b>RD</b> ≥ 0. 5), the lower superficial femoral vein (SFV) segments (6. 6 % in the right leg and 6. 4 % in the left leg <b>for</b> <b>RD</b> ≥ 0. 5), and the upper SFV (5. 2 % in the right leg and 4. 7 % in the left leg <b>for</b> <b>RD</b> ≥ 0. 5) and short saphenous vein (SSV) (4. 6 % in the right leg and 5. 6 % in the left leg <b>for</b> an <b>RD</b> ≥ 0. 5) segments. In the superficial vein segments, there was little difference in the occurrence of reflux whether RD ≥ 0. 5 or RD > 1. 0 was used; but in the different deep vein segments, the prevalence of reflux was 2 to 4 times greater <b>for</b> <b>RD</b> ≥ 0. 5 rather than RD > 1. 0. Men had a higher prevalence of reflux in the deep vein segments than women, reaching statistical significance (P ≤. 01) in 4 of 5 segments <b>for</b> <b>RD</b> ≥ 0. 5. In general, the prevalence of reflux increased with age. Those with “venous disease” had a significantly higher prevalence of reflux in all vein segments than those with “no disease” (P ≤. 001). Conclusion: The prevalence of venous reflux in the general population was related to the presence of “venous disease,” although it was also present in those without clinically apparent disease. There was a higher prevalence of reflux in the deep veins in men than the deep veins in women. Follow-up study of the population will {{determine the extent to which}} reflux is a predictor of future disease and complications. (J Vasc Surg 1998; 28 : 767 - 76. ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{estimate}} the long-term cumulative incidence of and risk factors <b>for</b> retinal detachment (<b>RD)</b> after phacoemulsification using linked administrative medical data. Methods: We used the Western Australian Data Linkage System to identify patients who underwent phacoemulsification in Western Australia between January 1989 and December 2001. Retinal detachment cases were those patients requiring admission <b>for</b> <b>RD</b> surgery after phacoemulsification that were validated by medical record review. Kaplan-Meier {{analysis was used}} to calculate a cumulative incidence. Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used to determine the association between RD and risk factors, including patient demographics and operative and hospital factors. Some important risk factors, including axial length and Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy, were not examined. Results: We identified 237 RD cases following 65 055 phacoemulsification procedures, with a 10 -year cumulative incidence of 0. 68 % (95 % CI, 0. 56 %- 0. 83 %). Significant risk factors were year of surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 0. 43; 95 % CI, 0. 28 - 0. 66 [1999 - 2001 compared with 1989 - 1993] for each 5 -year period after 1985), age younger than 60 years (3. 76; 2. 83 - 5. 00), male sex (1. 91; 1. 45 - 2. 51), and anterior vitrectomy (27. 60; 19. 27 - 39. 52). Hospital location, patient rural or remote locality, hospital cataract surgery volume, failed intraocular lens insertion, length of stay, and patient insurance status were not significantly associated with <b>RD.</b> Conclusions: Risk <b>for</b> <b>RD</b> after phacoemulsification has almost halved for each 5 -year period since its adoption in the mid 1980 s.
