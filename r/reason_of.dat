The writer got {{the data from the}} utterances in the conversations of the four main African American characters in the movie that the writer transcribed herself. In her analysis, the writer classified the kinds of turn-taking irregularities, that is, interruption and overlap. Then, she determined the <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> each. In her findings, the writer found that the four African American characters in the movie did turn-taking irregularities, that is, interruption and overlap and tended to overlap others.

Finally, the writer concluded that the four main African American characters in the movie do not do the turn-taking properly where one has to wait for the speaker to finish his/her talk. Their tendency to do the turn-taking improperly leads them to the interruption and overlap with some reasons. Moreover, it also shows their characteristics that they like to talk fast and the listeners corresponds to them fast, too...|$|R

5|$|Apolinario de la Cruz {{was born}} on July 22, 1815 in Barrio Pandác {{in the town of}} Lucban in Tayabas {{province}} (now Quezon Province) back when the Philippines was a colony of the Spanish Empire. His parents—Pablo de la Cruz and Juana Andres—were peasants and devout Catholics. Dela Cruz was literate, but stated that he had no formal education. Despite that, it is very likely that he received primary religious instruction and attended the local public primary school in Lucban. In 1829, he decided to become a priest and tried to join the Order of Preachers in Manila. During those times, Roman Catholic religious orders barred indios (native people of the Philippines) from joining, thus de la Cruz's application was rejected for the sole <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> his race. He then decided to work as a donado (lay brother) at the San Juan de Dios Hospital where he was admitted to the Cofradía de San Juan de Dios, a brotherhood affiliated with the hospital and was open to indios. During this time, he improved his public speaking and studied the Bible along with other religious writings.|$|E
5|$|Having {{left his}} command to General Belliard on 8 March, three days later, Nansouty {{was a part}} of a convoy of several officers, heading to Paris. On the road to the capital, they were {{attacked}} by a pulk of Cossacks, which managed to disperse the convoy's escort. Nansouty and his officers fought their way out sabre in hand and made a run for it towards the river Aisne. Reaching the riverbanks, the General got isolated and, as he was preparing to cross the river on horseback, his horse was shot under him, throwing the General to the ground. Nevertheless, he stood up and swam to the other bank of the river and safety. This event, as well as his tireless activity during the campaign, seem to suggest that his health was not the main <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> his departure from the army. It is also unlikely that the Emperor himself decided to replace him, given Belliard's tentative approach at the Battle of Craonne and this General's subsequent provisional status as commander, after Nansouty's departure. It is thus more likely that Nansouty resigned, following his disputes with the Emperor.|$|E
