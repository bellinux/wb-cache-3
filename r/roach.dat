5|$|Further {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Powell with Brown and <b>Roach</b> {{took place in}} New York during January and February 1955. The tracks cut in January, with arrangements by Neal Hefti, were released as Clifford Brown with Strings. The February sessions yielded the albums Study in Brown, and, combined with tracks from the previous year, Clifford Brown & Max <b>Roach.</b> The latter {{was added to the}} Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. At the Newport Jazz Festival in July 1955 Powell played with <b>Roach</b> and others as backing for Washington. Recordings made of the Brown–Roach quintet at the same event were released decades later.|$|E

50|$|On December 8, 1998 the roaches' habitat was deintigrated (separated) {{from the}} GAS can. The <b>roaches</b> {{were put into}} the can on July 28. The program coordinators had no idea whether any of the <b>roaches</b> had survived. When the habitat was finally removed from the can, the {{students}} from DuVal peered inside to see if anything was alive. At least four adult <b>roaches</b> didn't survive. But two of the little <b>roaches</b> did survive. This program gained media attention from local TV stations and newspapers who were on hand to witness a memorable academic moment for the school.|$|R
5|$|Military decorum at Fort <b>Roach</b> {{was less}} formal {{than in most}} units. Saluting was optional, and unit members called each other by their first names.

50|$|The <b>Roaches,</b> Hen Cloud and Ramshaw Rocks {{are formed}} from a thick bed of coarse {{sandstone}} ('gritstone') of Namurian age, a subdivision of the NW European Carboniferous system from ca 315 to 326.4 Ma, which occurs widely across the Peak District and takes its name—the <b>Roaches</b> Grit—from this location. The nearby Five Clouds are formed from a thinner bed of similar sandstone {{known as the}} Five Clouds Sandstone. These sandstones originated as delta sands dropped by major rivers draining a mountainous landmass to the north. The sandstone beds of both The <b>Roaches</b> and Hen Cloud dip moderately steeply to the east into the north-south-aligned syncline known as the Goyt Trough. The same beds at Ramshaw Rocks dip steeply to the northwest into the syncline. The {{southern end of the}} <b>Roaches</b> is defined by the presence of an east-west fault that runs through the col separating the <b>Roaches</b> from Hen Cloud.|$|R

2500|$|If a mane is <b>roached,</b> it {{can take}} [...] for it to stop {{sticking}} straight {{up in the air}} and lie over onto the neck, and a year or more to return to a natural length. [...] For this reason, manes that are <b>roached</b> usually need to be kept that way, though occasionally <b>roaching</b> a damaged mane and allowing it to grow out evenly is effective as a last resort for a mane that has been partly torn out, badly tangled or otherwise cannot be restored to a smooth condition.|$|R
5|$|Although he {{also played}} swing and R, Powell {{was known as}} a bebop player. This {{included}} using right-hand single-note lines. In his playing with Brown and <b>Roach,</b> he was fond of inserting musical quotes, including from nursery rhymes and opera.|$|E
5|$|Brian <b>Roach</b> and Daniel Brinkman have {{suggested}} that Daspletosaurus social interaction would have more closely resembled the modern Komodo dragon, where non-cooperative individuals mob carcasses, frequently attacking and even cannibalizing {{each other in the}} process.

50|$|Cockroaches live in nests. As such, {{killing a}} few <b>roaches</b> {{that happen to}} wander into a trap is an {{inadequate}} means of controlling the pest.

25|$|Cockroaches {{are mainly}} nocturnal and will run away {{when exposed to}} light. A study tested the {{hypothesis}} that cockroaches use just two pieces of information to decide where to go under those conditions: how dark {{it is and how}} many other cockroaches there are. The study conducted by José Halloy and colleagues at the Free University of Brussels and other European institutions created a set of tiny robots that appear to the <b>roaches</b> as other <b>roaches</b> and can thus alter the roaches' perception of critical mass. The robots were also specially scented so that they would be accepted by the real <b>roaches.</b>|$|R

5|$|Meet the Parents is {{a remake}} of a 1992 film {{of the same name}} {{directed}} by Greg Glienna and produced by Jim Vincent. Glienna—who also played the original film's main protagonist—and Mary Ruth Clarke co-wrote the screenplay. Universal Studios purchased the rights to Glienna's film with the intent of creating a new version. Jim Herzfeld expanded the original script but development was halted for some time. Jay <b>Roach</b> read the expanded script and expressed his desire to direct the film but Universal declined him. At that time, Steven Spielberg was interested in directing the film while Jim Carrey was interested in playing the lead role. The studio only offered the film to <b>Roach</b> once Spielberg and Carrey left the project.|$|E
