40|$|International audienceThe <b>record</b> <b>layer</b> is {{the main}} bridge between TLS {{applications}} and internal sub-protocols. Its core functionality is an elaborate authenticated encryption: streams of messages for each sub-protocol (handshake, alert, and application data) are fragmented, multiplexed, and encrypted with optional padding to hide their lengths. Conversely, the sub-protocols may provide fresh keys or signal stream termination to the <b>record</b> <b>layer.</b> Compared to prior versions, TLS 1. 3 discards obsolete schemes {{in favor of a}} common construction for Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD), instantiated with algorithms such as AES-GCM and ChaCha 20 -Poly 1305. It differs from TLS 1. 2 in its use of padding, associated data and nonces. It encrypts the content-type used to multiplex between sub-protocols. New protocol features such as early application data (0 -RTT and 0. 5 -RTT) and late handshake messages require additional keys and a more general model of stateful encryption. We build and verify a reference implementation of the TLS <b>record</b> <b>layer</b> and its cryptographic algorithms in F, a dependently typed language where security and functional guarantees can be specified as pre-and post-conditions. We reduce the high-level security of the <b>record</b> <b>layer</b> to cryptographic assumptions on its ciphers. Each step in the reduction is verified by typing an F module; when the step incurs a security loss, this module precisely captures the corresponding game-based security assumption. We first verify the functional correctness and injectivity properties of our implementations of one-time MAC algorithms (Poly 1305 and GHASH) and provide a generic proof of their security given these properties. We show the security of AEAD given any secure one-time MAC and PRF. We extend AEAD, first to stream encryption, then to length-hiding, multiplexed encryption. Finally, we build a security model of the <b>record</b> <b>layer</b> against an adversary that controls the TLS sub-protocols. We compute concrete security bounds for the AES-GCM and ChaCha 20 -Poly 1305 ciphersuites, and derive recommended limits on sent data before re-keying. Combining our functional correctness and security results, we obtain the first verified implementations of the main TLS 1. 3 record ciphers. We plug our implementation of the <b>record</b> <b>layer</b> into an existing TLS library and confirm that the combination interoperates with Chrome and Firefox, and thus that experimentally the new TLS <b>record</b> <b>layer</b> (as described in RFCs and cryptographic standards) is provably secure...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a simulation modelof the complete {{perpendicular magnetic recording}} process, from write current to readback voltage. Gontradictory to most models published in literature, it is neither analytical nor iterative. In the model of this thesis, the actual physical process is piecewisely linearized during every stage of recording. Extensive {{attention is paid to}} the influence of the so-called "image-charge effect", caused by the presence of a head and a keeper layer in the vicinity of a magnetized <b>recording</b> <b>layer.</b> Part I gives an introduction to the problem and to the topic of image charges. The assumptions determining the validity of the model are described and accounted for. Also, a theoretical derivation concerning the "switching criterion", the level in the <b>recording</b> <b>layer</b> at which self-consistency is assumed, is given. In part II, the actual model is set up. First, the recording of a single magnetization reversal in a DG pre-magnetized <b>recording</b> <b>layer</b> with no head-to-medium motion is analyzed and modeled. Then, the <b>recording</b> <b>layer</b> is shifted along the activated head, which causes a relaxation of the original magnetization distribution. This part of the process, so far predominantly neglected in literature, is described in detail. Also, the influence of a varying head field is investigated to complete the modeling of the write process. Finally, the readback process is modeled using the well-known theorem of reciprocity. The effects of variations of the model's parameters are described in part III. The image-charge effect is treated in a quantitative manner and the influence of the obliquity of the <b>recording</b> <b>layer's</b> intrinsic hysteresis loop is investigated. Also, the influences of the bit density and the head field to coercive field ratio are described. Finally, the thicknesses of the <b>recording</b> <b>layer</b> and the air gap are varied to find that, as expected, the air gap should be chosen as small as possible. Some mathematical derivations concerning demagnetizing fields, image-charge fields and a conformal mapping have been put into appendices completing the thesis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Nation-states {{and other}} {{organizations}} are increasingly deploying deep-packet inspection (DPI) technologies to censor Internet traffic based on application-layer content.

We show how to build a general-purpose FTE system, in which these formats are defined compactly by families of regular expressions. Moreover, we specify and implement a full FTE record-layer protocol. We exhibit formats that are guaranteed to avoid known filters, and give a framework for learning formats from noncensored HTTP traffic. These formats are put to use in our FTE <b>record</b> <b>layer,</b> to explore trade-offs between performance and steganographic capabilities.

40|$|In this paper, we analyse the Transport Layer Security (TLS) pro-tocol (in particular, {{bilateral}} TLS in public-key mode) {{within the}} strand spaces setting.

The outcome of our analysis provides a formalisation of the security services provided by TLS and proves that, under reasonable assump-tions, the abstract model suggested by Broadfoot and Lowe is correct. To that end, we reduce the complexity of the protocol using fault-preserving simplifying transformations. We extend the strand spaces model in order to include the cryptographic operations used in TLS and facilitate its analysis. Finally, we use the extended strand spaces model to fully analyse the public-key mode of bilateral TLS with its two main components: the Handshake and <b>Record</b> <b>Layer</b> protocols. ...|$|E

40|$|TLS is {{the most}} {{important}} cryptographic protocol in use today. However, up to now there is no complete cryptographic security proof in the standard model, nor in any other model. We give the first such proof for the core cryptographic protocol of TLS ciphersuites based on ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange (TLS-DHE), which include the cipher suite TLS DHE DSS WITH 3 DES EDE CBC SHA mandatory in TLS 1. 0 and TLS 1. 1. It is impossible to prove security of the TLS Handshake in any classical key-indistinguishabilitybased security model (like e. g. the Bellare-Rogaway or the Canetti-Krawczyk model), due to subtle issues with the encryption of the final Finished messages of the TLS Handshake. Therefore we start with proving the security of a truncated version of the TLS Handshake protocol, which has also been considered in previous work on TLS. Then we define the notion of authenticated and confidential channel establishment (ACCE) as a new security model which captures precisely the security properties expected from TLS in practice, and show that the combination of the TLS Handshake protocol with the TLS <b>Record</b> <b>Layer</b> can be proven secur...|$|E
40|$|TLS {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{deployed}} cryptographic protocols on the Internet; it is used to protect the con dentiality and integrity of transmitted data in various client-server protocols. Its non-standard use of cryptographic primitives, however, makes it hard to formally assess its security. It is in fact dicult to use traditional (well-understood) securitybr /> notions for the key-exchange (here: handshake) and the encryption/authentication (here:br /> <b>record</b> <b>layer)</b> parts of the protocol due to the fact that, on the one hand, traditional gamebasedbr /> notions do not easily support composition, and on the other hand, all TLS versionsbr /> up to and including 1. 2 combine the two phases in a non-standard way. br /> In this paper, we provide a modular security analysis of the handshake in TLS version 1. 2 br /> and a slightly sanitized version of the handshake in the current draft of TLS version 1. 3,br /> following the constructive cryptography approach of Maurer and Renner (ICS 2011). Webr /> provide a deconstruction of the handshake into modular sub-protocols and a security proofbr /> for each such sub-protocol. We also show how these results can be combined with analysesbr /> of the respective <b>record</b> <b>layer</b> protocols, and the overall result is that in all cases thebr /> protocol constructs (unilaterally) secure channels between the two parties from insecurebr /> channels and a public-key infrastructure. This approach ensures that (1) each sub-protocolbr /> is proven in isolation and independently of the other sub-protocols, (2) the overall securitybr /> statement proven can easily be used in higher-level protocols, and (3) TLS can be used inbr /> any composition with other secure protocols. br /> In more detail, for the key-exchange step of TLS 1. 2, we analyze the RSA-based andbr /> both Die-Hellman-based variants (with static and ephemeral server key share) under abr /> non-randomizability assumption for RSA-PKCS and the Gap Die-Hellman assumption,br /> respectively; in all cases we make use of random oracles. For the respective step of TLS 1. 3,br /> we prove security under the Decisional Die-Hellman assumption in the standard model. Inbr /> all statements, we require additional standard computational assumptions on other primitives. br /> In general, since the design of TLS is not modular, the constructive decomposition isbr /> less ne-grained than one might wish to have and than it is for a modular design.
