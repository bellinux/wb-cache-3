50|$|The {{physical}} register files used by reservation stations usually collapse unused {{entries in}} parallel with the issue queue they serve, which makes these register files larger in aggregate, and consume more power, and more complicated than the simpler register files used in a tag-indexed scheme. Worse yet, every entry in each reservation station can be written by every <b>result</b> <b>bus,</b> so that a reservation-station machine with, e.g., 8 issue queue entries per functional unit will typically have 9 times as many bypass networks as an equivalent tag-indexed machine. Consequently, result forwarding consumes much more power and area than in a tag-indexed design.|$|E

50|$|The station {{occupied}} {{two blocks}} of land, between D Street and F Street. A Harvey House was {{located on the}} east side of the station. In 1901, the Bakersfield and Kern Electric Railway was relocated to serve the station. It provided a direct connection between the Bakersfield Santa Fe Station and the Bakersfield Southern Pacific Station (about 2.5 miles east in East Bakersfield). In 1938, Santa Fe began operating intermodal rail service on the San Joaquin Valley line. Trains would travel between Oakland and Bakersfield on the railroad line. At Bakersfield passengers would transfer to one of several bus routes, which departed for destination in Southern California. As a <b>result,</b> <b>bus</b> bays were constructed at the station.|$|E

40|$|Abstractâ€”With the {{scaling of}} {{technology}} {{and the need for}} higher performance and more functionality, power dissipation is becoming a major bottleneck for microprocessor designs. Because clock power can be significant in high-performance pro-cessors, we propose a deterministic clock-gating (DCG) technique which effectively reduces clock power. DCG is based on the key observation that for many of the pipelined stages of a modern processor, the circuit block usage in the near future is known a few cycles ahead of time. Our experiments show an average of 19. 9 % reduction in processor power with virtually no performance loss for an eight-issue, out-of-order superscalar by applying DCG to execution units, pipeline latches, D-cache wordline decoders, and <b>result</b> <b>bus</b> drivers.

40|$|With the {{scaling of}} {{technology}} {{and the need for}} higher performance and more functionality, power dissipation is becoming a major bottleneck for microprocessor designs. Pipeline balancing (PLB), a previous technique, is essentially a methodology to clockgate unused components whenever a program's instruction-level parallelism is predicted to be low. However, no non-predictive methodologies are available in the literature for efficient clock gating. This paper introduces deterministic clock gating (DCG) based on the key observation that for many of the stages in a modern pipeline, a circuit block's usage in a specific cycle in the near future is deterministically known a few cycles ahead of time. Our experiments show an average of 19. 9 % reduction in processor power with virtually no performance loss for an 8 -issue, out-of-order superscalar processor by applying DCG to execution units, pipeline latches, D-Cache wordline decoders, and <b>result</b> <b>bus</b> drivers.

40|$|Transit Project Assessment Process (TPAP) {{for a new}} {{bus garage}} to be located near the {{intersection}} of McNicoll Avenue and Kennedy Road. The proposed bus garage will include an indoor storage facility to accommodate 250 conventional buses in the barn, brake, body and paint shop, bus cleaning areas, maintenance and transportation offices, two service lines, fuel and repair bay, employee amenities including parking locker room and lunch room/cafeteria and material receiving, storage and distribution area. It is our understanding that as of 2014, forecasted growth in transit ridership is projected to require the acquisition of approximately 120 new buses by 2018, some {{of which will be}} the significant longer articulated buses.

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} application of archived data from Automatic Data Collection Systems (ADCS) to transportation planning {{with a focus on}} bus passenger Origin-Destination (OD) inferences at the bus-route level and on travel behavior, using London as an example. This research demonstrates the feasibility and ease of applying the trip-chaining method to infer bus passengers' boarding and alighting locations, and validates the results by comparing them with the Bus Passenger Origin and Destination (BODS) survey data in London. With the inferred OD matrices, the variations of weekday and weekend bus route OD patterns over a two-week period are examined for planning purposes. Given these variations, reliance on ADCS can provide transit planners with more comprehensive, reliable and correct information for service planning than traditional manual surveys. Moreover, while interchange conditions and performance are considered important inputs for public transit planning, collecting such data has not been easy. Based on the inferred OD matrices and the Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) data, alighting times for bus passengers can also be estimated. As a <b>result,</b> <b>bus</b> journey stages can easily be linked to form complete journeys based on the difference between the subsequent trip's boarding time and the previous trip's alighting time for each bus passenger. By comparing the interchange time and the connecting bus route's headway, this research also provides a way to evaluate connecting bus services and bus passengers' interchange patterns. Finally, this research can be expanded to the full bus network and other travel modes, opening the door to developing more comprehensive data bases for use in intermodal network planning. by Wei Wang.

40|$|When {{developing}} a public transportation service, the network design {{is one of}} the crucial stages. In this paper, a sensitivity analysis of the network design stage is discussed in order to analyse the changes to the network when certain input parameters are changed. The proposed methodology consists of three main phases: the selection of the input parameters that will be changed in the sensitivity analysis and the definition of scenarios in which these parameters will be changed; the search for the best network design for each scenario using a Genetic Algorithm; and the analysis of the results. The Demand, Travel Times, Line Length, Fleet Size, Stop Time and Transfer Time are the selected input parameters used to create a total of 33 scenarios.
