Mark Moses {{returned}} to the series as a series regular after appearing briefly as Paul in the sixth season finale. On his return, Moses commented, [...] "There was some talk about [...] a year ago. And there’s often talk in Hollywood. Sometimes it pans out, sometimes it doesn’t.

500|$|As Petrucci and Rudess {{felt that}} the album needed real string lines and choirs, {{as well as other}} organic sounds, they enlisted the help of veteran {{composer}} David Campbell to assist with aspects of the orchestration and handle the logistics of recording all of the necessary musicians. Reflecting on the process for Keyboard, Rudess explained, [...] "Our initial thought was, let’s do it all on rock instruments and let David arrange it, but that wasn’t <b>really</b> <b>thinking</b> ahead in terms of who we are. When we go into the studio, we tend to work on things until they’re pretty polished. So we got into what we called pre-orchestrating. I’d use any sound at my disposal to place strings where we wanted to hear strings, choir where we wanted choir, and so forth—but without getting overly specific about a certain patch or instrument library being the one, because we knew it was all going to be replaced with real players." [...] Once the album's arrangements were complete, they were performed and recorded in studios around the world, with Campbell conducting and leading the sessions from Los Angeles.|$|E

Weiss spoke {{about some of the}} thought process behind the motivations of the characters that were featured prominently in the episode. David Benioff began by speaking about Sandor [...] "the Hound" [...] Clegane, saying [...] "I think suffering a near death experience probably changes anyone, and that certainly has changed Sandor Clegane. He's a more thoughtful person than he was when we last saw him, he's probably more aware of his vulnerabilities, he knows how close he came to dying, and he's <b>really</b> <b>thinking</b> about his past in a way that he never had before." [...] Weiss continued, [...] "The unfortunate, ugly reality of the kind of pacifism that Ray is preaching is often suicidal when you're {{in the middle of the}} kind of world that they're all in. Something sad about the fact that this person who tried desperately to walk away from what he was is being given no real choice but to go full throttle back in the direction of what he really is, which is a killer." ...|$|E

I jumped out at these people in bathrooms and begged. And they all smiled politely but what they were clearly <b>really</b> <b>thinking</b> was, 'This woman is an idiot.'" [...] Rhimes also explains why {{it took so long}} to produce this episode: [...] The script was written by Rhimes in November 2010. She centered the episode around Ramirez's character, Callie, and stated that the storyline would have developed regardless of whether it involved musical performances. Sara Ramirez used the opportunity to launch her career as a singer-songwriter; an alternate version of [...] "The Story" [...] is included on her debut EP, released four days prior to the episode's premiere. The episode served to improve the relationship between Mark and Arizona. Capshaw assessed that, [...] "The traumatic circumstance leads to them having a greater understanding of each other and then appreciation, and then need for each other and desire to be in each other’s lives. They come to care, I think, for one another." ...|$|E

Glass Swords was {{recorded}} in Whyte's father's house in Glasgow and in his home in London after Whyte had moved there. The album's music was developed with Whyte not having a strong idea for it, noting that he was [...] "just making tracks and not <b>really</b> <b>thinking</b> too much of it as being an album". The album was created using Ableton on a personal computer along with a midi guitar controller, a midi keyboard, keyboard, electric guitar and a microphone. To give the album an analogue sound, Whyte used compressors and tape distortion plugins to get the tracks what he described as a [...] "sort of warmth". Vocals on the album were done by Whyte on the track [...] "Surph" [...] while his girlfriend Nightwave performed some of the backing vocals.

It features a [...] "squealing" [...] synth, a banging fast-paced beat, screaming, rough {{as well as}} at times hoarse vocals and blaring sonics. According to the staff members of Idolator, the beat in the background is augmented by hand-claps similar to that of [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" [...] (2008) by Beyoncé Knowles, most noticeable toward the end. According to a press release by Interscope Records, the song's lyrics make reference to a [...] "raw infectious club-thumping message to female empowerment" [...] and about being in a committed relationship. She further said the sentiment reflected in the song is [...] "exactly what her girls are apt to shout behind closed doors" [...] and that the lyrics are meant to reflect a woman's many moods and shifting desires: [...] "I write from a female perspective, but I'm also telling men what women are <b>really</b> <b>thinking</b> and feeling about them.

In [...] "Rabiosa", Shakira sings about her partner's sex appeal. [...] "Loca" [...] expresses Shakira's erratic and obsessive {{behaviour}} towards her lover, more so than his other leading lady. However, Shakira also {{said that there are}} some songs which [...] "will remain in people’s hearts and people’s consciousness, sometimes forever". She described these tracks as [...] "songs that have the power to feed people’s relationships and states of mind and states of spirit". According to Billboard, the title track is composed of [...] "evocative and hopeful" [...] lyrics which are dedicated to Argentine singer-songwriter and Shakira's friend Gustavo Cerati, who had been in a coma {{around the time of the}} release of the album. [...] "Antes de las Seis" [...] deals with issues of longing, regrets and loneliness. Shakira said these songs are written [...] "in such a personal and intimate way that at that moment.

500|$|In the United States, {{the first}} three films in the Die Hard series were rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America. Live Free or Die Hard, however, was edited to obtain a PG-13 rating. In some cases, {{alternate}} profanity-free dialogue was shot and used or swearing was cut out in post-production to reduce profanity. Director Len Wiseman commented on the rating, saying [...] "It was about three months into it , and I hadn't even heard that it was PG-13... But in the end, it {{was just trying to}} make the best Die Hard movie, not <b>really</b> <b>thinking</b> so much about what the rating would be." [...] Bruce Willis was upset with the studio's decision, stating, [...] "I really wanted this one {{to live up to the}} promise of the first one, which I always thought was the only really good one. That's a studio decision that is becoming more and more common, because they’re trying to reach a broader audience. It seems almost a courageous move to give a picture an R rating these days. But we still made a pretty hardcore, smashmouth film." [...] Willis said he thought that viewers unaware that it was not an R-rated film would not suspect so due to the level and intensity of the action as well as the usage of some profanity, although he admitted these elements were less intense than in the previous films. He also said that this film was the best of the four: [...] "It's unbelievable. I just saw it last week. I personally think, it's better than the first one." ...|$|E

I've learned a lot from them", and he explained that he was working on that day with Mandler, someone he respects and looks up to. On the video, Drake said, [...] "We talked colors, we talked epic, emotion-evoking visuals." [...] He called the story of the video interesting and the song tells [...] "sort of a love story". He explained that the video {{has a lot to do}} with his debut album, stating [...] "The album is about finding love, feeling 'Have I sold my soul' as far as 'Will I ever be able to gain the trust of a woman? Will I only be able to be around the dark, evil women? Will I ever find that pure love?' Those elements are in the video." [...] In a separate interview on his Away From Home Tour, with MTV News, Drake said the video takes the song to [...] "another place". He said it offers up a different look to the song. He explained, [...] "This video is what I was <b>really</b> <b>thinking</b> about. The song is like a bad dream — but it's not a bad dream, it's not a terrible dream. It's a little evil. The video really reflects that. It's a struggle between the purities of my past life and what this new life has to offer. Even in the video, you see me looking back and forth between the two and deciding. At the end of the video I don't necessarily make a decision, but when you get the album, you'll see what choice I make." ...|$|E
