40|$|Abstract—The use of {{multiple}} voltage settings for dynamic power management is an effective design technique. Recent {{research has shown that}} testing for <b>resistive</b> bridging <b>faults</b> in such designs requires more than one voltage setting for 100 % fault coverage; however, switching between several supply voltage settings has a detrimental impact on the overall cost of test. This paper proposes an effective gate sizing technique for reducing test cost of multi-Vdd designs with bridge defects. Using synthesized ISCAS and ITC benchmarks and a parametric fault model, experimental results show that for all the circuits, the proposed technique achieves single Vdd test, without affecting the fault coverage of the original test. In addition, the proposed technique performs better in terms of timing, area, and power than the recently proposed test point insertion technique.

40|$|PosterInternational audienceWith {{the rapid}} advance of power {{electronics}} technologies, DC electrical grids are expanding at every scale and various high temperature superconducting devices {{are being developed}} to operate in such grids. Up to now applications of superconductivity with a clear impact in the electrical sector have been HTS power cables and fault current limiters. Various prototypes have been built and tested around the world either in the industry or research institutions. These technologies have demonstrated the potential to address increasing power transmission demand and protection against faults in electrical grids. In the present work, a new application of HTS technology for DC grids is introduced. The device referred to as “superconducting power filter” aims at increasing the stability of DC grids by adding a current-dependent resistance to a classical RLC filter. The device {{is closely related to}} a <b>resistive</b> <b>fault</b> current limiter (r-ScFCL), but here the superconductor is expected to be operated around its critical current thereby remaining in the superconducting state during load fluctuations, with the option of providing timely over-current protection if required. In comparison with other stabilization techniques, a superconducting power filter achieves a fully passive stabilization without limiting significantly the energy transferred to the load in nominal operation. To clarify its operation, a simple circuit constituted of an ideal constant DC voltage source and a controlled power load connected through a RLC filter in series with a superconducting power filter is considered. Using an electrical-thermal model of the device, the stability of the DC grid is assessed depending on the design parameters of the device. The corresponding experimental setup has been assembled to back up the numerical results.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is directed towards two potential electrical power applications of high temperature superconductors: superconducting coils for magnetic field generation and superconducting power switches. The first systematic investigation into the bending strain tolerance of I_c in short lengths of Ag/Tl- 1223 PIT tape {{is presented as a}} preliminary study into the required coil winding protocol for the fabrication of superconducting coils. Comparison of the microstructure with the bending strain tolerance of I_c for Ag/Tl- 1223 tapes shows that the shape and degree of porosity and the grain size can explain many features of the experimental data. Monofilamentary in situ reacted Ag/Tl- 1223 PIT tape has excellent bending strain tolerance up to strains of 1. 5 %. Superconducting coils of total tape length up to 5 m have been fabricated via a wind-and-react route using a dip coated refractory electrical insulation and tested at 77 K in different applied magnetic fields. The promising current transport properties of short lengths of Ag/Tl- 1223 PIT tape are not transferred to these coils. There is strong evidence that this degradation is due to the self field limitation of I_c. Thick films of Bi- 2212 on MgO substrates have been investigated for applications as superconducting power switches. The effects of the substrate format (single crystal or polycrystalline MgO) on the Bi- 2212 thick film are discussed. The absence of grain boundaries and contaminants makes single crystal MgO the preferred substrate material. Variations in the heat treatment schedule and film thickness are shown to affect the long range grain connectivity and hence the reproducibility of J_c for Bi- 2212 thick films on single crystal MgO. Processing details for the achievement of reproducible values of J_c (around 3000 Acm"-" 2) are presented. The power switching characteristics of Bi- 2212 thick films on single crystal MgO substrates have been investigated at liquid nitrogen temperatures. The relative merits of two switching regimes are outlined: superconducting/flux flow and flux flow/normal. A small scale device operating in the latter switching regime has been fabricated and tested. The shallow E-J curve for c-axis aligned Bi- 2212 ensures that the quench current density (J_q) is significantly greater than J_c. Values of J_q of around 40 000 Acm"-" 2 (77 K, 0 T) have been measured. Thick films of Bi- 2212 are identified as promising materials for <b>resistive</b> <b>fault</b> current limiters.
