5000|$|Valuation: When {{distributions}} include <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> {{the investor}} is receiving excess capital back from {{operations of the}} trust. A trust unit with high <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> distributions will often attract a higher market value because the <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> portion <b>of</b> the distribution is tax deferred until the unit is sold.|$|R
50|$|Corporations may {{declare that}} a payment to {{shareholders}} is a <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> {{rather than a}} dividend. Dividends are taxable in the year that they are paid, while <b>returns</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> work by decreasing the cost basis {{by the amount of}} the payment, and thus increasing the shareholder's eventual capital gain. Although most qualified dividends receive the same favorable tax treatment as long-term capital gains, the shareholder can defer taxation <b>of</b> a <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> indefinitely by declining to sell the stock.|$|R

30|$|The figure shows {{a declining}} {{trend of the}} rates <b>of</b> <b>return</b> to <b>capital.</b> In 2010, the {{last year when the}} {{estimate}} is available, the rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> was as low as 5.1  %. Note that this is the average rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> to <b>capital</b> <b>of</b> the whole country. For firms with some monopoly power, the marginal rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> to <b>capital</b> is lower than the average rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> because the latter includes the monopoly profit, and therefore the average marginal rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> to <b>capital</b> <b>of</b> the whole country is below 5.1  %. Furthermore, because the rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> to <b>capital</b> varies across investment projects, there must be many projects with marginal rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> even lower than 5.1  %. These results about the rates <b>of</b> <b>return</b> to <b>capital</b> suggest that one needs to be concerned about overinvestment, especially if the declining trend continues.|$|R

40|$|For {{households}} seeking {{retirement income}} security, short-term deposits (such as money market accounts, certificates of deposit, and Treasury bills) seem an ideal and appropriate investment choice – particularly given the recent extraordinary turbulence {{in the financial}} markets. Over the past year, an investment in short-term deposits would have actually outperformed investments in corporate bonds and far outperformed corporate stocks. Retired households exhibit a strong preference for holding such apparently safe investments. One study found that 86 percent of households nearing retirement (ages 60 - 64) had bank accounts, while only 33 percent owned stocks directly and only 7 percent owned bonds directly. And the desire for short-term investments increased with age. But short-term investments, while safe, produce uncertain returns. This Issue in Brief highlights the trade-off that households must make between a guaranteed <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> and a guaranteed return on capital – they cannot have {{both at the same}} time. Short-term deposits provide a guaranteed <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> but offer no guarantees as to the return the household will receive on its capital. In contrast, a portfolio of Treasury bonds of appropriate maturities provides a guaranteed return on capital, but with the <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> guaranteed only at maturity. This brief argues that retired households seeking a secure and dependable income should prioritize return on <b>capital</b> over <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b> For such households, the true risk-free asset is a portfolio of bonds and, in particular, inflation-protected bonds of appropriate maturities. ...|$|R

5000|$|The Court of Appeals {{concluded}} that the [...] "tax benefit theory" [...] applied by the Tax Court [...] "seems to be an injection into the law of an equitable principle, found neither in the statutes nor in the regulations." [...] Because the Tax Court's reasoning was not embodied in any statutory precept, {{the court held that}} the Tax Court was not authorized to resort to it in determining whether the recovery should be treated as income or <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b> It held as matter of law that the recoveries were neither <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> nor capital gain, but were ordinary income in the year received.|$|R
50|$|Structured Products (closed ended {{investment}} funds) frequently use high distributions, {{that include}} <b>returns</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> as a promotional tool. The retail investors these funds are sold to rarely have the technical knowledge to distinguish income from ROC.|$|R
50|$|The {{payout ratio}} is a metric used to {{evaluate}} the sustainability of distributions from REITs, Oil and Gas Royalty Trusts, and Income Trust. The distributions are divided by the free cash flow. Distributions may include any <b>of</b> income, flowed-through <b>capital</b> gains or <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some investors prefer using free {{cash flow}} instead of net income to measure a company's {{financial}} performance, because {{free cash flow}} {{is more difficult to}} manipulate than net income.

50|$|Since the Trust's {{assets are}} {{considered}} a depletable resource, its dividend payments are not taxed at the regular dividend rate, but rather as <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> instead <b>of</b> <b>return</b> on investment; this is an additional tax advantage in the United States, and applies to all royalty trusts.|$|R

5000|$|Lack {{of income}} guarantees: {{similar to a}} {{dividend}} paying stock, income trusts do not guarantee minimum distributions or even <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b> If the business starts to lose money, the trust can reduce or even eliminate distributions; this is usually accompanied by sharp losses in units' market value.|$|R
50|$|However, {{it is also}} settled {{law that}} {{compensatory}} damages are not tax-exempt just because they are a <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b> Exemption applies only to the portion of these damages that recovers the cost basis of that capital; any excess damages serve to realize prior appreciation, and should be taxed as income.|$|R

50|$|Other jurisdictions provide {{corporations}} a {{means of}} designating, within limits, whether a distribution is a distribution of earnings taxable to the shareholder or a <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b> For example, in Canada a corporation may designate a distribution to shareholders as a distribution <b>of</b> Paid Up <b>Capital</b> (PUC), and thus not taxable as a dividend, to the extent <b>of</b> remaining <b>capital,</b> or an eligible dividend.|$|R
