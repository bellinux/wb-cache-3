It is emphasized that the effective functioning <b>of</b> the <b>Pension</b> Fund <b>of</b> Ukraine is an important condition for sustainable human development, and in view of this factors influencing the process of its improvement have been identified. Firstly, this is {{a decrease in the}} number of the working population against the increase in the number <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> <b>recipients,</b> which directly affects the system <b>of</b> mandatory <b>pension</b> insurance. It is found that the effectiveness of the latter can be guaranteed by two conditions: excess of the working population over the number of persons of retirement age and fair payment of insurance premiums. Secondly, it is the population age structure. In this context it is noted that for our state it is economically advantageous to have a lot of working pensioners because they themselves form the pension they receive. Thirdly, it is the level of remuneration. A serious aspect of the problem is the shadowing of incomes and shifting of personal responsibility for the own well-being to the state. Therefore, it is proposed at the legislative level to develop a procedure of a gradual increase of wages and raising the share of the latter in the cost of goods or services. Fourthly, it is a low level of income among the majority of people of retirement age. Therefore, as an alternative source of rising funds for making pension payments there determined an accumulation system <b>of</b> mandatory <b>pension</b> insurance. Fifth, it is the differentiation of the rate <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> payments. It is claimed that the rate <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> should be the same for the people who paid equal premiums.

Material and methods: Information on gender, age and disability grade <b>of</b> new <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> disability <b>pension</b> in Iceland and corresponding information on the Icelandic population for each year in the period 1992 to 2003 was used to calculate the incidence <b>of</b> disability <b>pension.</b> The results were compared with data on the rate of unemployment in Iceland. Results: The incidence <b>of</b> disability <b>pension</b> was relatively high from 1992 to 1995, was lower from 1996 to 2002 and then increased markedly in 2003. There is a strong correlation between the incidence <b>of</b> disability <b>pension</b> and the rate of unemployment among both genders in Iceland during the period covered by the study. An increase from 1999 to 2000 in the incidence <b>of</b> disability <b>pension</b> among females coincided in time with the introduction of a new method of disability assessment in September 1999, but also with an increase in the rate of unemployment among females.

The increase in the number <b>of</b> <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> disability <b>pension</b> in Iceland recently has a strong statistical correlation with changes in the labour marked, especially with rising unemployment and increased pressure at work.

We find that the extension of retirement benefits to informal sector workers results in efficiency losses due to adverse effects on capital accumulation and the allocation of resources across formal and informal sectors. Despite these losses <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> social <b>pensions</b> experience welfare gains as the positive insurance effects attributed to the extension of a social insurance system dominate.

40|$|In all {{developed}} countries the fiscal ties {{of the tax}} and benefit system serve to complement, and sometimes substitute for, traditional family bonds between young and old. Older people are major <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> public <b>pensions</b> and public health care systems. Since these public transfers and services are financed primarily from the taxes paid by people of working age, the welfare system in effect transfers resources from young to old. But rather than see the fiscal interdependency between young and old as being analogous to the ties that bind children, parents and grandparents together in familial networks, it is often interpreted as an oppressive burden that the old place on the young. This paper examines arguments that population ageing will exacerbate this burden, and {{may lead to the}} collapse of public welfare systems.

5000|$|Compared {{to other}} liberal democracies, Ireland's pension {{policies}} have average coverage, which includes 78 {{percent of the}} workforce, and it offers different types <b>of</b> <b>pensions</b> for employees to choose from. The Irish pension system is designed as a pay-as-you-go program {{and is based on}} both public and private pension programs. The OECD's Reviews <b>of</b> <b>Pension</b> Systems: Ireland, explains the structures of both the public and private pension systems. [...] "The public pension system has two sets of flat-rate benefits: 1) a basic flat-rate benefit to all retirees that meet the contribution conditions, the State pension (contributory) or SPC and the State pension (transition) or SPT; and 2) a means-tested benefit tot those that have not contributed or have not contributed enough, the State pension (non-contributory) or SPNC. The SPC is payable from age 66, with the maximum personal rate of EUR 230.30 a week for a single person (paid for 52 weeks per year), corresponding to 33.1 percent of average earnings. The SPNC is currently payable from age 66, with a maximum rate of EUR 219 per week for a single person, i.e. 31.5 percent of average earnings. All <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> benefits are entitled to the Household Benefits Package comprising an electricity/gas and telephone allowance as well as a free television license, if they are over the age of 70, while those between the age of 65-69 are means-tested. The contribution conditions for the SPC are that recipients have started paying social insurance before reaching age 56 and they also have paid at least 520 full-rate insurance contributions if reaching 66 after April 6, 2012. The contribution base rate is currently 14.75 percent, with 10.75 percent paid by employers and 4 percent by employees (except for employees who earn less than EUR 352 per week for whom only employer contributions are payable). The SPNC is financed through general taxation and is paid according to need. As for private pension programs, there three main types; 1) occupational pension schemes that are set up by employers; 2) Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSAs) that are personal pension saving plans and contributions are made by individuals; and 3) Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) that are also a personal pension saving plan but are excluded from those who are already enrolled in a company pension plan". [...] When looking at the coverage of public and private pension programs, SPC and SPNC cover 46 percent of the workforce, and SPT and occupational or private pension covers 37 percent of the workforce, which is a result from striking differences in industries and occupations. Raab and Gannon point out how [...] "occupational pensions are generally not mandatory, except in the public sector, and that 55 percent of professionals are able to expect a firm's pension but the corresponding share for sales people is 23 percent". [...] The Irish pension policies are designed to offer incentives for labor participation but are still reforming to the changes in the economy.|$|R

For both years, 1993 and 1997, we find an odds ratio of about 1. 5 of being denied disability pension if your income is below the median. While the diagnosis is of importance, this seems to be a result of recent policy changes and trends only, as one was more likely to be denied disability pension with a musculoskeletal disorder in 1993, and more likely to be granted it in 1997 with the same diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|Background The Perceived Functioning & Health (PFH) {{questionnaire}} {{was developed to}} collect, in a standardized manner, which work activities are limited due to health conditions according to {{the perception of the}} client. In this study the questionnaire’s reliability and validity are investigated. Methods The PFH questionnaire is comprised of 147 questions, distributed over 33 scales, pertaining to the client’s psychosocial and physical work limitations. The PFH data of 800 respondents were analyzed: 254 healthy employees, 408 workers on sick leave and 138 <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> a disability <b>pension.</b> Internal consistency (Cronbach’s α) for the scales was established. The test–retest reliability was examined for the data <b>of</b> 52 <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> a disability <b>pension</b> who filled out the PFH twice within an interval of 1  month. Validation was established by taking the nature of the limitations as a criterion: mental limitations, physical limitations or a mix of both. To this end, the respondents were divided into groups distinguished on the basis of self-classification, as well as classification on the basis of disease codes given by insurance and occupational health physicians: a “healthy” group, subjects with only physical (“physical” group) or mental limitations (“mental” group) or mixed limitations (“mixed” group). The scale scores of these groups were compared and tested using analyses-of-variance and discriminant analyses. Results The scales were found to have sufficient to good internal consistency (mean Cronbach’s-α =  0. 79) and test–retest reliability (mean correlation r =  0. 76). Analyses-of-variance demonstrated significant differences between the scores of the mental, physical and healthy groups on most of the expected scales. These results were found both in groups defined by self-classification as well as in groups based on disease codes. Moreover, discriminant analyses revealed that the a priori classification of the respondents into three groups (mental, physical, healthy) for more than 75 % of them corresponded with the classification on the basis of scale scores obtained from the questionnaire. Furthermore, limitations due to specific types of complaints (low back pain, fatigue, concentration problems) or diagnosed disorders (musculoskeletal disorders, reactive disorders, endogenous disorders) were clearly reflected in the scores of the related scales of the PFH. Conclusion The psychometric properties of the PFH with respect to reliability and validity were satisfactory. The PFH would appear to be an appropriate instrument for systematically measuring functional limitations in subjects on sick leave and in those receiving disability pensions, and {{could be used as a}} starting point in a disability claim procedure...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} main {{principals}} of tax administration and tax law, their compliance or violating in particular situations. Presenting of their content and real meaning {{is provided by}} description and explanation of their (wrong) application under various circumstances. The Supreme Administrative Court´s case laws and jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court are significant sources of information in this part. Along with accompanying effects arising from violating the principles this thesis continues with analysis of Working pensioners affair, especially the case n. Pl. ÚS 31 / 13. Here the provision of § 35 ba art. 1 l. a) Income Tax Act has been contested according to which the tax of a taxpayer, who is a <b>recipient</b> <b>of</b> an old-age <b>pension</b> benefits from statutory pension insurance scheme or similar abroad one at 1 st January of the taxable period, shall not be reduced by the basic amount of 24 840 CZK. There are not omitted demographical, legal and economic aspects of the affair in this thesis as well as relevant regulatory development for the years 2000 to 2015. The thesis brings evaluation of compliance or violating {{of the principles of}} tax administration and tax law through the analysis of key elements in own review...|$|R
40|$|Musculoskeletal pain is a {{significant}} cause of years lived with disability, and expenses of examination and treatment, reduced work ability, sickness absence and disability benefits are considerable. A better understanding of work-related factors that can modify the association between pain and disability is essential, {{in order to develop}} effective preventive strategies. The aim of the current {{study was to examine the}} independent effects of musculoskeletal pain, physical workload and work satisfaction on risk for disability pension, as well as the possible modifying role of physical workload and work satisfaction on the relation between musculoskeletal pain and disability pension risk. Data on 44 713 individuals, originating from the second wave of the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT 2, 1995 - 97), was linked to a national registry on incident disability pension from Statistics Norway (FD-trygd, follow-up through 2007). We used Cox regression analyses to estimate adjusted relative risks (RRs) <b>of</b> disability <b>pension</b> associated with musculoskeletal pain and work-related factors. Precision of the estimated associations was assessed by 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs). Additionally, tests of statistical interaction (i. e., deviation from multiplicativity or additivity) were conducted, to explore possible synergistic effects. During the 10 -year follow-up, 6764 individuals (15. 1 %) became <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> disability <b>pension.</b> Chronic musculoskeletal pain was strongly associated with risk <b>of</b> disability <b>pension</b> (males: RR 2. 06, 95 % CI 1. 90 - 2. 24; females: RR 2. 59, 95 % CI 2. 40 - 2. 79), and activity-interfering pain increased the risk even further. The independent effects of physical workload and work satisfaction were modest; however, individuals who concurrently experienced chronic pain and had heavy physical work or low work satisfaction were at the highest risk <b>of</b> disability <b>pension.</b> For males and females with pain and heavy physical work, RRs and 95 % CIs were 2. 60 (2. 24 - 3. 02) and 3. 37 (2. 88 - 3. 95), respectively. For the joint effects of pain and low work satisfaction, RRs and 95 % CIs were 2. 98 (2. 34 - 3. 79) for males and 3. 29 (2. 67 - 4. 07) for females. Despite the strong associations, there were no statistically significant interaction between these factors, based on p-values from the multiplicative test and RERI estimates with 95 % CIs from the additive test. In conclusion, musculoskeletal pain is positively associated with disability pension risk, and work-related factors such as physical workload and work satisfaction may contribute to a further amplification of this risk. Persons with musculoskeletal pain exposed to heavy physical work, or with low work satisfaction, should be given special attention to prevent early work disability...|$|R
