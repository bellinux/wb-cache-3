50|$|The {{two most}} common ways of {{measuring}} industrial <b>temperatures</b> are with <b>resistance</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>detectors</b> (RTDs) and thermocouples. Choice {{between them is}} usually determined by four factors.|$|R
50|$|For {{cryogenic}} {{temperature measurement}} down to 30K, PT-100 sensor (<b>resistance</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>detectors</b> (RTDs)) is used, and for lower than 30K it {{is required to}} use Silicon Diode for accuracy. There are also other cryogenic detectors which are used to detect Cryogenic particles.|$|R
50|$|An <b>resistance</b> <b>{{temperature}}</b> <b>detector</b> (RTD) is used {{to acquire}} temperature readings. These readings are used to compensate for temperature. A pressure transducer {{is used to}} account for changes in pressure. Pressure affects the rigidity of the flexible hose. Changes in rigidity affect {{the way that the}} flexible hose deflects. The flexible hose is used to measure deflection. Larger weights cause more deflection in the flexible rubber hose. The flexible hose must be repeatable, accurate, and precise. Without these three attributes, an accurate measurement cannot be obtained.|$|E
50|$|Platinum was {{proposed}} by Sir William Siemens {{as an element}} for a <b>resistance</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>detector</b> at the Bakerian lecture in 1871: it is a noble metal and has the most stable resistance-temperature relationship over the largest temperature range. Nickel elements have a limited temperature range because the amount of change in resistance per degree of change in temperature becomes very non-linear at temperatures over 572 °F (300 °C). Copper has a very linear resistance-temperature relationship; however, copper oxidizes at moderate temperatures and cannot be used over 302 °F (150 °C).|$|E
5000|$|Thermal {{conductivity}} gauges rely on {{the fact}} that the ability of a gas to conduct heat decreases with pressure. In this type of gauge, a wire filament is heated by running current through it. A [...] thermocouple or <b>Resistance</b> <b>Temperature</b> <b>Detector</b> (RTD) can then be used to measure the temperature of the filament. This temperature is dependent on the rate at which the filament loses heat to the surrounding gas, and therefore on the thermal conductivity. A common variant is the Pirani gauge which uses a single platinum filament as both the heated element and RTD. These gauges are accurate from 10 torr to 10−3 torr, but they are sensitive to the chemical composition of the gases being measured.|$|E
50|$|The {{measurement}} of temperature {{is a vital}} part of instrumentation in petrochemical industries. Platinum <b>Resistance</b> <b>Temperature</b> <b>Detectors</b> (RTD's) are often used for their excellent temperature response. Thermocouples are used in locations that need a more durable sensor. Thermocouples come in many types.|$|R

50|$|Thermowells are tubular {{fittings}} used {{to protect}} temperature sensors installed in industrial processes. A thermowell consists of a tube closed {{at one end and}} mounted in the process stream. A temperature sensor such as a thermometer, thermocouple or <b>resistance</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>detector</b> is inserted in the open end of the tube, which is usually in the open air outside the process piping or vessel and any thermal insulation. Thermodynamically, the process fluid transfers heat to the thermowell wall, which in turn transfers heat to the sensor. Since more mass is present with a sensor-well assembly than with a probe directly immersed into the process, the sensor's response to process temperature changes is slowed by the addition of the well. If the sensor fails, it can be easily replaced without draining the vessel or piping. Since the mass of the thermowell must be heated to the process temperature, and since the walls of the thermowell conduct heat out of the process, sensor accuracy and responsiveness is negatively impacted by the addition of a thermowell.|$|E
5000|$|One popular {{technique}} for electro-thermal {{characterization of materials}} is the 3ω-method, in which a thin metal structure (generally a wire or a film) is deposited on the sample {{to function as a}} resistive heater and a <b>resistance</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>detector</b> (RTD). The heater is driven with AC current at frequency ω, which induces periodic joule heating at frequency 2ω due to the oscillation of the AC signal during a single period. There will be some delay between the heating of the sample and the temperature response which is dependent upon the thermal properties of the sensor/sample. This temperature response is measured by logging the amplitude and phase delay of the AC voltage signal from the heater across a range of frequencies (generally accomplished using a lock-in-amplifier). Note, the phase delay of the signal is the lag between the heating signal and the temperature response. The measured voltage will contain both the fundamental and third harmonic components (ω and 3ω respectively), because the Joule heating of the metal structure induces oscillations in its resistance with frequency 2ω due to the temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of the metal heater/sensor as stated in the following equation: ...|$|E
30|$|Temperature {{measurement}} can {{be accomplished}} using several types of sensing mechanisms. Temperature measurement systems generally consist of a sensor, a transmitter, an external power supply (for some types of systems), and the wiring that connects these components. The temperature measurement sensors most commonly used in engineering applications are thermocouples, <b>Resistance</b> <b>Temperature</b> <b>Detectors</b> (RTDs), and infrared (IR) thermometers.|$|R

50|$|A variant uses three wires, with {{separate}} load and sense leads at one end, {{and a common}} wire on the other. Voltage drop in the common wire is compensated for by assuming {{that it is the}} same as in the load wire, of the same gauge and length. This technique is widely used in resistance thermometers, also known as <b>resistance</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>detectors</b> or RTDs.|$|R
5000|$|To be {{representative}} of the average temperature of fluid, the thermowell must extend a few per cent of the inside diameter of the process pipe or vessel (Normally 1/3 rd of the pipe inside diameter). A rule of thumb that is sufficient for most industrial applications (approximately 1% accuracy) is to ensure that the thermowell projects 5 times its own diameter into the process plus the length of its sensing element. So, for a grounded thermocouple spring-loaded into a thermowell with a 1-inch-diameter shank and a tip thickness of [...]25 inch, a typical immersion length would equal 5.5 inches (1 inch OD x 5 + [...]25 inch well tip thickness +.25 inch sensor wall thickness = 5.5 inches). A thermowell is typically machined from solid bar stock and gun-drilled to ensure a long straight bore that closely approximates the diameter of the installed sensor (ex: a [...]260-inch bore matching a [...]250-inch sensor). A thermowell is typically mounted into the process stream by way of a threaded, welded, sanitary cap or flanged process connection. The temperature sensor such as a thermometer, thermocouple or <b>resistance</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>detector</b> is inserted in the open end of the thermowell and typically spring-loaded to ensure that the outside tip of the temperature sensor is in metal to metal contact with the inside tip of the thermowell.|$|E

40|$|In {{this project}} all designs are {{constructed}} {{based on two}} major systems.
