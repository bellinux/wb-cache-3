5|$|It was {{not until}} the late 18th and the early 19th century that the first European Americans {{explored}} the <b>remote</b> <b>and</b> hard-to-reach area. Mormon scouts visited the area in the 1850s to gauge its potential for agricultural development, use for grazing, and settlement.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the role}} of the camel is {{diminishing}} with the advent of technology and modern means of transport, it is still an efficient mode of communication in <b>remote</b> <b>and</b> less-developed areas. The dromedary has been used in warfare since the 2nd century BC, and it remains popular for racing, particularly in the Arab world. Riding camels of Arabia, Egypt and the Sahara are locally known as the Dilool, the Hageen and the Mehara respectively; several local breeds are included within these groups.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham's {{early history}} {{is that of}} a <b>remote</b> <b>and</b> {{marginal}} area. The main centres of population, power and wealth in the pre-industrial English Midlands lay in the fertile and accessible river valleys of the Trent, the Severn and the Avon. The area of modern Birmingham lay in between, on the upland Birmingham Plateau and within the densely wooded and sparsely populated Forest of Arden.|$|E

5|$|Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games is a {{collection}} of twenty-four events based on the Olympic Games. On the Wii, the events consist of using the motion sensor capabilities of the Wii <b>Remote</b> <b>and</b> Nunchuk attachment to control the actions of the on-screen character. The player moves the remote {{in a manner similar to}} the method the separate games are played in real life; for example, swinging the Wii Remote to replicate hammer throw or pulling back the <b>remote</b> <b>and</b> tilting the Nunchuk like a bow and arrow. While the Nunchuck is required for archery, it is optional for most of the events. There are also events that are more physically demanding, such as the five running events which require rapid drumming of the controller. Some aspects of the gameplay are computer controlled. For example, in table tennis the player movement is controlled by the Wii, while the swinging of the racket is controlled by the player. The DS game is the same in design, but due to lack of motion controls, its events are much less physically demanding than those on the Wii. For example, instead of drumming the controller, players have to quickly stroke the touchscreen.|$|E
5|$|Metroid Prime 3: Corruption is a first-person action-adventure game. The player {{controls}} the protagonist, Samus Aran, using the Wii <b>Remote</b> <b>and</b> Nunchuk devices. The Nunchuk enables the player to perform actions such as moving Samus and locking on to enemies and targets. The Wii Remote allows the player to execute actions such as jumping, aiming, and firing weapons.|$|E
5|$|Once drained, stabilised and fertilised, Chat Moss became prime {{agricultural}} land, supplying Manchester with {{salad and}} other vegetables.

5|$|After {{the rest}} day, the riders {{were faced with}} the Giro's longest stage, with {{numerous}} high mountain climbs along the course and {{the distinction of being}} the race's queen stage. It was originally scheduled to include the Col d'Izoard, which has been featured numerous times in the Tour de France as an Hors Categorie climb. Race officials later decided to alter the course, staying on the Italian side of the Alps, believing the stretches that were to take place in France were too <b>remote</b> <b>and</b> that radio communication in the area could not be assured. The course as it originally was designed mimicked exactly a course used in the 1949 Giro d'Italia.|$|E

5|$|Along with Annie Smith Peck, Workman was {{recognized}} {{during the early}} 20th century {{as one of the}} most famous female climbers in the world. Their rivalry demonstrated that women could climb the most <b>remote</b> <b>and</b> difficult terrain on the planet. Women had climbed regularly in the Alps since the 1850s, but in the Himalayas, mountaineering had been dominated by wealthy English men. No other women, however, climbed in the Himalaya until well after World War I, by which time improvements in equipment and organization had shifted that nature of risks and difficulties of expeditions.|$|E
5|$|During the English {{occupation}} of Scotland under the Commonwealth, fortresses {{in the style}} of the trace italienne were built. These were polygonal in plan with triangular bastions, as at Ayr, Inverness and Leith. Twenty smaller forts were built as far away as Orkney and Stornoway. Control of the Highlands was secured by strongpoints at Inverlocky and Inverness. These were built at a massive cost in money and manpower. The citadel at Inverness, begun in 1652 and using stone shipped from as far away as Aberdeen, had cost £50,0000 when it was still unfinished by 1655. Inverlochy had a garrison of 1,000 and from 1654 became the centre for a new administrative region of Lochaber, made up of three of the most <b>remote</b> <b>and</b> lawless shires.|$|E
5|$|Elliott {{entered the}} University of Melbourne in 1898 to study law, but left in 1900 {{to serve in}} the Imperial Bushmen in the South African War. He was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal, and given a British Army commission, but chose to remain with the Victorian Imperial Bushmen as an {{attached}} subaltern. He returned to Australia in 1901, but went back to South Africa to serve with the Border Scouts, who patrolled <b>remote</b> <b>and</b> inhospitable areas. In December 1901, he distinguished himself in repelling a numerically superior Boer force, and received a congratulatory telegram from General Lord Kitchener. After he returned to Australia, he completed his law degree and became a solicitor. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Militia in 1904, and he was promoted to lieutenant in 1905, captain in 1909, major in 1911, and lieutenant colonel in 1913, commanding the 58th Battalion (Essendon Rifles).|$|E

5|$|Fighting enemies, {{which appear}} {{in both the}} overworld and dungeons, relies on Link's use of his sword and shield. Link's sword {{movements}} are mapped to the direction the Wii Remote is flicked by the player, and other moves include a forward thrust and a stab. Enemy movements are designed to anticipate and block Link's combat movements. By raising the Wii Remote, the sword gathers energy which can be unleashed in a Skyward Strike. Skyward Strikes are also used to trigger environmental elements such as magical switches. The shield is controlled with the Nunchuck: when the shield is raised, {{it can be used}} to reflect attacks. Spin attacks and Finishing Blows are activated by swinging both the Wii <b>Remote</b> <b>and</b> Nunchuck. Link's health is represented with Hearts, with Link taking damage whenever he is hit: if he loses all Hearts, the game ends.|$|E
5|$|In December 2008, Resident Evil was ported to the GameCube's successor, the Wii, {{along with}} Resident Evil Zero.

Although Capcom originally {{had no plans}} to release the Wii version outside Japan, arguing that the game would not sell very well, the game was eventually released in North America and Europe in June 2009 due to the commercial success of Resident Evil 5. The Wii version received generally favorable reviews from critics, but some publications criticized it for its outdated controls, lack of new features, and lack of widescreen support.|$|E
