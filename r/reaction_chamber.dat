5|$|As {{a natural}} side-effect {{of the size}} of the fuel {{elements}} and their resulting explosions, ICF designs use a very large <b>reaction</b> <b>chamber</b> many meters across. This lowers the neutron flux on any particular part of the chamber wall through the inverse square law. Additionally, there are no magnets or other complex systems near or inside the reactor, and the laser is isolated on the far side of long optical paths. The far side of the chamber is empty, allowing the blanket to be placed there and easily maintained. Although the <b>reaction</b> <b>chamber</b> walls and final optics would eventually embrittle and require replacement, the chamber is essentially a large steel ball of relatively simple multi-piece construction that could be replaced without too much effort. The <b>reaction</b> <b>chamber</b> is, on the whole, dramatically simpler than those in magnetic fusion concepts, and the LIFE designs proposed building several and quickly moving them in and out of production.|$|E
5|$|The recoil {{momentum}} of the produced mendelevium-256 atoms is used to bring them physically {{far away from the}} einsteinium target from which they are produced, bringing them onto a thin foil of metal (usually beryllium, aluminium, platinum, or gold) just behind the target in a vacuum. This eliminates the need for immediate chemical separation, which is both costly and prevents reusing of the expensive einsteinium target. The mendelevium atoms are then trapped in a gas atmosphere (frequently helium), and a gas jet from a small opening in the <b>reaction</b> <b>chamber</b> carries the mendelevium along. Using a long capillary tube, and including potassium chloride aerosols in the helium gas, the mendelevium atoms can be transported over tens of meters to be chemically analyzed and have their quantity determined. The mendelevium can then be separated from the foil material and other fission products by applying acid to the foil and then coprecipitating the mendelevium with lanthanum fluoride, then using a cation-exchange resin column with a 10% ethanol solution saturated with hydrochloric acid, acting as an eluant. However, if the foil is made of gold and thin enough, it is enough to simply dissolve the gold in aqua regia before separating the trivalent actinides from the gold using anion-exchange chromatography, the eluant being 6Mhydrochloric acid.|$|E
25|$|The Farnsworth–Hirsch fusor is an {{apparatus}} designed by Farnsworth to create nuclear fusion.

50|$|Sulfuric acid {{produced}} in the <b>reaction</b> <b>chambers</b> is limited to about 35% concentration. At higher concentrations, nitrosylsulfuric acid precipitates on the lead walls as chamber crystals {{and is no longer}} able to catalyze the oxidation reactions.|$|R
25|$|The flow of {{reactants}} {{into the}} <b>reaction</b> <b>chamber</b> and subsequent ejection {{occur in a}} series of about 70 pulses, {{at a rate of about}} 500 pulses per second. The whole sequence of events takes only a fraction of a second. These pulsations are caused by repeated microexplosions which are the results of the continuous pressure on the reservoir and the oscillatory opening and closing of the valve that controls access to the <b>reaction</b> <b>chamber.</b> This pulsed mechanism is beneficial for the beetles' survival because the system uses pressure instead of muscles to eject the spray at a constant velocity, saving the beetle energy. Also, the reintroduction of new reactants into the vestibule where enzymes are stored, reduces the temperature of the chamber, thereby protecting the peroxidases and catalases from thermal denaturation.|$|E
25|$|Another popular {{reactor type}} is the flow through reactor (continuous flow reactor), {{which also has}} {{internal}} electrodes, but this reactor allows monomer gas to flow through the <b>reaction</b> <b>chamber</b> as its name implies, which should give a more even coating for polymer film deposition. It has the advantage that more monomer keeps flowing into the reactor in order to deposit more polymer. It has the disadvantage of forming what is called “tail flame,” which is when polymerization extends into the vacuum line.|$|E
25|$|There {{are a few}} {{designs for}} {{apparatus}} used in plasma polymerization, {{one of which is}} the Bell (static type), in which monomer gas is put into the <b>reaction</b> <b>chamber,</b> but does not flow through the chamber. It comes in and polymerizes without removal. This type of reactor is shown in Figure 1. This reactor has internal electrodes, and polymerization commonly takes place on the cathode side. All devices contain the thermostatic bath, which is used to regulate temperature, and a vacuum to regulate pressure.|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} novel {{platform}} technology of enzyme assay using microfluidic channel. Employing {{the patterns of}} microfluidic channel on a plastic chip, the dilution of substrate solution and enzyme reactions are sequentially carried out in microfluidic channels, The microfluidic device is fabricated by micromolding processes with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer. The device consists of microfluidic channel modules running four assay tests on a single device and each module comprises six <b>reaction</b> <b>chambers</b> linked with microfluidic channels. Overall dimension of the microfluidic device is {{the same size as}} a 96 -well microtiter plate and 24 <b>reaction</b> <b>chambers</b> in device adapt to the conventional 96 -well architecture to be detected by a microplate reader. This provides the method to overcome the limitations of conventional assay platform which requires a special detection instrument, the manual dilution of the substrate solution and individual measurement of enzyme reactions.

25|$|The large {{majority}} of known organisms use catalase in every organ, with particularly high concentrations occurring in the liver in mammals. One unique use of catalase occurs in the bombardier beetle. This beetle has two sets of liquids that are stored separately in two paired glands. The larger of the pair, the storage chamber or reservoir, contains hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide, while the smaller, the <b>reaction</b> <b>chamber,</b> contains catalases and peroxidases. To activate the noxious spray, the beetle mixes {{the contents of the}} two compartments, causing oxygen to be liberated from hydrogen peroxide. The oxygen oxidizes the hydroquinones and also acts as the propellant. The oxidation reaction is very exothermic (ΔH = −202.8 kJ/mol) and rapidly heats the mixture to the boiling point.|$|E
25|$|In the Changing World Technologies (CWT) process, the {{feedstock}} {{material is}} first ground into small chunks, and mixed with water {{if it is}} especially dry. It is then fed into a pressure vessel <b>reaction</b> <b>chamber</b> where it is heated at constant volume to around 250 °C. Similar to a pressure cooker (except at much higher pressure), steam naturally raises the pressure to 600 psi (4 MPa) (near the point of saturated water). These conditions are held for approximately 15 minutes to fully heat the mixture, after which the pressure is rapidly released to boil off most of the water (see: Flash evaporation). The result {{is a mix of}} crude hydrocarbons and solid minerals. The minerals are removed, and the hydrocarbons are sent to a second-stage reactor where they are heated to 500°C, further breaking down the longer hydrocarbon chains. The hydrocarbons are then sorted by fractional distillation, in a process similar to conventional oil refining.|$|E
500|$|Once the nobelium-255 is produced, {{it can be}} {{separated}} out {{in a similar way}} as used to purify the neighboring actinide mendelevium. The recoil momentum of the produced nobelium-255 atoms is used to bring them physically far away from the target from which they are produced, bringing them onto a thin foil of metal (usually beryllium, aluminium, platinum, or gold) just behind the target in a vacuum: this is usually combined by trapping the nobelium atoms in a gas atmosphere (frequently helium), and carrying them along with a gas jet from a small opening in the <b>reaction</b> <b>chamber.</b> Using a long capillary tube, and including potassium chloride aerosols in the helium gas, the nobelium atoms can be transported over tens of meters. The thin layer of nobelium collected on the foil can then be removed with dilute acid without completely dissolving the foil. The nobelium can then be isolated by exploiting its tendency to form the divalent state, unlike the other trivalent actinides: under typically used elution conditions (bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (HDEHP) as stationary organic phase and 0.05Mhydrochloric acid as mobile aqueous phase, or using 3Mhydrochloric acid as an eluant from cation-exchange resin columns), nobelium will pass through the column and elute while the other trivalent actinides remain on the column. However, if a direct [...] "catcher" [...] gold foil is used, the process is complicated by the need to separate out the gold using anion-exchange chromatography before isolating the nobelium by elution from chromatographic extraction columns using HDEHP.|$|E

For further improvement, the theoretical background was investigated with attention to the Jackson factor and the supersaturation.

A first direct structural insight into this substrate shuttling mechanism was obtained by cryo-EM analysis, where ACP is observed bound to the various catalytic domains in the barrel-shaped yeast fatty acid synthase.

2500|$|High-concentration [...] is {{referred}} to as [...] "high-test peroxide" [...] (HTP). It can be used either as a monopropellant (not mixed with fuel) or as the oxidizer component of a bipropellant rocket.

The propellant is pumped into a <b>reaction</b> <b>chamber,</b> where a catalyst, usually a silver or platinum screen, triggers decomposition, producing steam at over , which is expelled through a nozzle, generating thrust. [...] monopropellant produces a maximal specific impulse (Isp) of 161 s (1.6 kN·s/kg). Peroxide was the first major monopropellant adopted for use in rocket applications. Hydrazine eventually replaced hydrogen-peroxide monopropellant thruster applications primarily because of a 25% increase in the vacuum specific impulse.
