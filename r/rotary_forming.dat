The main script is FFauto. m, which will write input files and user subroutines and call FFauto_Abaqus 11 Submit. m to run the input files or intermediate post-processing {{to set up the}} next job. More specifically: 	FFauto will write an input deck based on 2 D implicit heat transfer and then run it. 	Once the analysis is complete, it will perform some cursory post processing by writing an Abaqus Python script and then submitting that. 	Based on the post-processing of the implicit analysis, it will then generate a 3 D explicit forming analysis input file. Depending on the operator's input, this can include an explicit cooling step as well. 	It will then submit the 3 D analysis. Note that steps can be skipped - that is, if the results for an implicit heat transfer calculation are available, then it will use those results to generate the explicit step(s). Note that the implicit user subroutine *uhard. f contains a DFLUX subroutine in addition to the UHARD subroutine. This was not employed in the published work.

Based on numerical simulation software DEFORM- 3 D, we built the finite element model. And the whole forming process was simulated successfully. The stress and strain distributions of workpiece in the process were analyzed. The effect of forming angle, stretching angle and billet size on rolling force was investigated, then determined the proper process parameters. The differences between the round billet rolling and the square billet rolling were obtained by comparing the tangential, axial and radial forces during the rolling process. The studied results show the availability of using square billet as blank in train axle CWR and provide important realistic meaning and application value. The cross wedge rolling(CWR) is a metal deformation process of <b>rotary</b> <b>forming.</b> To produce a part, a billet should be placed between two rollers, which move tangentially relative to each other.

40|$|Abstract. Liquid-Driven Stretch Blow Molding {{is a new}} and {{innovative}} method to produce PET bottles [1]. In the well-established Stretch Blow Molding (SBM) process, preforms are biaxially deformed by pressurized air into a cavity. The resulting bottles are transferred to a separate machine, where the desired product is filled in. In contrast to that, Liquid-Driven Stretch Blow Molding is characterized by employing the liquid product to deform the material. The former separated blowing and filling steps are thus combined to a single forming stage leading to numerous advantages in energy consumption, cycle time and machine footprint. In this paper, a numerical simulation of the new process is presented. An additional challenge compared to SBM simulations is thereby the consideration {{of the interaction between}} liquid and preform. The load application cannot be solely represented by the pressure because the influx behavior as well as gravity and inertia forces influence the preform deformation. A smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) approach is applied to the simulation to incorporate the additional effects. The process model is evaluated by prototype experiments. In addition, a feasibility study shows the applicability of a <b>rotary</b> <b>forming</b> system to the new process...|$|E

40|$|Mechanically alloyed oxide {{dispersion}} strengthened (ODS) Fe-Cr-Al alloy {{thin walled}} tubes and sheets, produced via powder processing and consolidation methodologies are promising materials for eventual use at temperatures up to 1200 C {{in the power}} generation industry, far above the temperature capabilities of conventional alloys. Target end-uses range from gas turbine combustor liners to high aspect ratio (L/D) heat exchanger tubes. Grain boundary creep processes at service temperatures, particularly those acting in the hoop direction, are the dominant failure mechanisms for such components. The processed microstructure of ODS alloys consists of high aspect ratio grains aligned parallel to the tube axis, a result of dominant axial metal flow which aligns the dispersoid particles and other impurities in the longitudinal direction. The dispersion distribution is unaltered on a micro scale by recrystallization thermal treatments, but the high aspect ratio grain shape typically obtained limits transverse grain spacing and consequently the hoop creep response. Improving hoop creep in ODS-alloy components will require understanding and manipulating the factors that control the recrystallization behavior, and represents a critical materials design and development challenge that must be overcome in order to fully exploit the potential of ODS alloys. The objectives of this program were to (1) increase creep-strength at temperature in ODS-alloy tube and liner components by 100 % via, (2) preferential cross-roll flow forming and grain/particle fibering in the critical hoop direction. The research program outlined was iterative and intended to systematically (i) examine and identify post-extrusion forming methodologies to create hoop strengthened tubes, to be (ii) evaluated at 'in-service' loads at service temperatures and environments. Our report outlines the significant hoop creep enhancements possible via secondary cross-rolling and/or flow-forming operations. Each of the secondary processes i. e. hot <b>rotary</b> <b>forming</b> and ambient-temperature flow forming exhibited improvement over the base-line hoop-creep performance. The flow formed MA 956 tubes exhibited performance superior to all other rolling/forming variants. At the conclusion of this program 2 ksi creep-test exposure for flow formed materials exceeded 7300 hours, 7694 hours and 4200 hours for creep tests operating at 950 C, 975 C and 1000 C respectively. The Larsen-Miller parameter for these improvised flow-formed tubes now exceeds 54. 14, i. e., better than ever recorded previously. The creep performance enhancement in cross-rolled MA 956 material samples versus the base creep property is elucidated. At least 2 - 3 orders of magnitude of improvement in creep rates/day and concomitant increases in creeplife are demonstrated for the flow formed tubes versus the base reference tests...|$|E

The results show that OQPSK eliminates the phase transition of Ï€, which belongs to constant envelope modulation, is suitable for the transmission under low SNR drilling fluid channel, meanwhile simplifies the phase adjustment and reduces generator design.
