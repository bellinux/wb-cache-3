50|$|<b>Retrofocus</b> <b>lenses</b> are {{extremely}} asymmetric with their large front elements and therefore {{very difficult to}} correct for distortion by traditional means. On the upside, the large negative element also limits the oblique cos4θ light falloff of regular wide-angle lenses.|$|R

50|$|For example, {{it is not}} {{uncommon}} for the rear element of a <b>retrofocus</b> <b>lens</b> of 18 mm to be more than 25 mm from the film plane. This makes it possible to design wide-angle lenses for single-lens reflex cameras.|$|E
50|$|Made in focal {{lengths of}} 24 mm, 28 mm, and 35 mm, the Angénieux <b>retrofocus</b> <b>lens</b> {{inspired}} other lens makers to produce wide-angle lenses {{of this type}} for almost every 35mm SLR, and helped {{to make it the}} definitive camera type of the late 20th century.|$|E
50|$|A fisheye lens is {{a special}} type of ultra-wide angle <b>retrofocus</b> <b>lens</b> {{with little or no}} attempt to correct for {{rectilinear}} distortion. Most fisheyes produce a circular image with a 180° field of view. The term fisheye comes from the supposition that a fish looking up at the sky would see in the same way.|$|E
50|$|The next {{landmark}} zoom was the Sigma 21-35mm f/3.5-4 (Japan) of 1981. It was {{the first}} super-wide angle zoom lens for still cameras (most 35mm SLRs). Previously, combining the complexities of rectilinear super-wide angle <b>lenses,</b> <b>retrofocus</b> <b>lenses</b> and zoom lenses seemed impossible. The Sigma's all-moving eleven element/seven group/three cell formula was a triumph of computer-aided design and multicoating.|$|R

5000|$|The problem {{arises when}} such lenses have too short a focal length {{to fit in}} front of the {{retractable}} mirrors used in reflex cameras. In such a situation, a pancake lens focuses in front of, rather than on, the focal plane (film or light sensor) of the camera. This has necessitated the design of <b>retrofocus</b> <b>lenses</b> that refocus the image further back, which is why such lenses are longer and bulkier than their [...] "pancake" [...] equivalents.|$|R
5000|$|In still photography, a single-lens {{reflex camera}} {{requires}} {{a space for}} the reflex mirror, imposing a limit {{on the use of}} wide-angle lenses of normal designs. The <b>retrofocus</b> <b>lens</b> addressed this situation by shifting the focal plane further back, thus making wider-angle lenses usable while retaining normal viewing and focusing. Unless the reflex mirror were locked in the [...] "up" [...] position, blacking out the viewfinder, the rearmost element of a non-retrofocal lens would be in the way as the mirror flipped up and down during exposure.|$|E
5000|$|... 1981: Sigma 21-35mm f/3.5-4 (Japan): first super-wide angle {{zoom lens}} for SLRs. For decades, {{combining}} {{the complexities of}} rectilinear super-wide angle <b>lenses,</b> <b>retrofocus</b> <b>lenses</b> and zoom lenses seemed impossibly difficult. Sigma did the impossible and reached a 91° maximum field of view for 35 mm SLRs with an all-moving eleven element formula through the maturation of computer-aided design and multicoating. In 2004, the Sigma 12-24mm f/4.5-5.6 EX DG Aspherical HSM (Japan) zoom reached 122°, wider than any SLR prime lens ever made, by taking additional advantage of aspherics and low dispersion glasses.|$|R
50|$|Inverting the {{telephoto}} configuration, employing one or {{more negative}} lens groups {{in front of a}} positive lens group, creates a wide-angle lens with an increased back focal distance. These are called <b>retrofocus</b> <b>lenses</b> or inverted telephotos, which have greater clearance from the rear element to the film plane than their focal length would permit with a conventional wide-angle lens optical design. This allows for greater clearance for other optical or mechanical parts such as the mirror parts in a single-lens reflex camera. Zoom lenses that are telephotos at one extreme of the zoom range and retrofocus at the other are now common.|$|R
50|$|In photography, {{distortion}} {{is particularly}} associated with zoom lenses, particularly large-range zooms, {{but may also}} be found in prime lenses, and depends on focal distance - for example, the Canon EF 50mm 1.4 exhibits barrel distortion at extremely short focal distances. Barrel distortion may be found in wide-angle lenses, and is often seen at the wide-angle end of zoom lenses, while pincushion distortion is often seen in older or low-end telephoto lenses. Mustache distortion is observed particularly on the wide end of zooms, with certain <b>retrofocus</b> <b>lenses,</b> and more recently on large-range zooms such as the Nikon 18-200 mm.|$|R
5000|$|In 1950, the Angénieux Retrofocus Type R1 35mm f/2.5 (France) was {{the first}} <b>retrofocus</b> wide angle <b>lens</b> for 35mm SLRs (Exaktas). Except for the front element, Pierre Angénieux' R1 was a five element Tessar. Note, [...] "retrofocus" [...] was an Angénieux {{trademark}} before losing exclusive status. The original generic term was [...] "inverted" [...] or [...] "reversed telephoto." [...] A telephoto lens has a front positive cell and rear negative cell; <b>retrofocus</b> <b>lenses</b> have the negative cell in front and positive cell to the rear. The first inverted telephoto imaging lens was the Taylor, Taylor & Hobson 35mm f/2 (1931, UK) developed to provide back-focus space for the beamsplitter prism used by the full-color via three negatives Technicolor motion picture camera. Other early members of the Angénieux Retrofocus line included the 28mm f/3.5 Type R11 of 1953 and the 24mm f/3.5 Type R51 of 1957.|$|R
50|$|The Angénieux <b>retrofocus</b> {{photographic}} <b>lens</b> is a {{wide-angle lens}} design that uses an inverted telephoto configuration. The popularity of this lens design made the name retrofocus synonymous {{with this type}} of <b>lens.</b> The Angénieux <b>retrofocus</b> for still cameras was introduced in France in 1950 by Pierre Angénieux.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{varieties}} of wide-angle lens: short-focus <b>lenses</b> and <b>retrofocus</b> lenses.Short-focus <b>lenses</b> are generally {{made up of}} multiple glass elements whose shapes {{are more or less}} symmetrical in front of and behind the diaphragm. As the focal length decreases, the distance of the rear element of the lens from the film plane or digital sensor also decreases.|$|R
2500|$|Except for {{close-up}} and macro photography, {{the effect}} of lens asymmetry is minimal. At unity magnification, however, the errors from neglecting the pupil magnification can be significant. Consider a telephoto lens with [...] and a <b>retrofocus</b> wide-angle <b>lens</b> with , at [...] The asymmetrical-lens formula gives [...] and , respectively. The symmetrical lens formula gives [...] in either case. The errors are −33% and 33%, respectively.|$|R
5000|$|... 1950: Angénieux 35mm f/2.5 Retrofocus Type R 1 (France): first <b>retrofocus</b> {{wide angle}} <b>lens</b> for 35 mm SLRs (for Exaktas). Regular wide angle lenses (meaning short focal length lenses) {{need to be}} mounted close to the film. However, SLRs require that lenses be mounted far enough {{in front of the}} film to provide space for the {{movement}} of the mirror — the [...] "mirror box." [...] Therefore, the focal length of early 35 mm SLR lenses were no less than about 40 mm. This prompted the development of wide view lenses with more complex retrofocus optical designs. These use very large negative front elements to force back-focus distances long enough to ensure clearance. Note, [...] "retrofocus" [...] was an Angénieux trademark before losing exclusive status. The original generic term is [...] "inverted telephoto." [...] A telephoto lens (multiple inventions, 1891) has a front positive group and rear negative group; <b>retrofocus</b> <b>lenses</b> have the negative group in front and positive group to the rear. The first inverted-telephoto imaging lens was the Taylor-Hobson 35mm f/2 (1931, UK) developed to provide back-focus clearance for the beamsplitter prism used by the full-color via three negative Technicolor motion picture process. Retrofocus wide angle prime lenses reached fields of view as wide as 118° with the Nikkor 13mm f/5.6 (Japan) lens for Nikon 35 mm SLRs in 1975, but they are extremely large compared to non-SLR short focal length lenses because of their gigantic negative elements.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike the {{previous}} types, natural vignetting (also known as natural illumination falloff) {{is not due}} to the blocking of light rays. The falloff is approximated by the cos4 or [...] "cosine fourth" [...] law of illumination falloff. Here, the light falloff {{is proportional to the}} fourth power of the cosine of the angle at which the light impinges on the film or sensor array. Wideangle rangefinder designs and the lens designs used in compact cameras are particularly prone to natural vignetting. Telephoto <b>lenses,</b> <b>retrofocus</b> wideangle <b>lenses</b> used on SLR cameras, and telecentric designs in general are less troubled by natural vignetting. A gradual grey filter or postprocessing techniques may be used to compensate for natural vignetting, as it cannot be cured by stopping down the lens. Some modern lenses are specifically designed so that the light strikes the image parallel or nearly so, eliminating or greatly reducing vignetting.|$|R
5000|$|Therefore, some prime {{lenses of}} this era began using [...] "floating elements" [...] - zoom-like {{differential}} cell movement in nested helicals for better close-up performance. For example, <b>retrofocus</b> wide angle <b>lenses</b> {{tend to have}} excessive spherical aberration and astigmatism at close focusing distances and so the Nippon Kogaku Nikkor-N Auto 24mm f/2.8 (Japan) of 1967 for Nikon 35mm SLRs had a Close Range Correction system with a rear three element cell that moved separately from the main lens to maintain good wide aperture image quality to a close focus distance of 30 cm/1 ft.|$|R
