40|$|Abstract. The {{application}} of Lamb waves to damage and/or defect detection in structures is typically confined to lower frequencies in regimes where only the lower order modes propagate {{in order to}} sim-plify interpretation of the scattered wave-fields. Operation at higher frequencies offers the potential to extend the sensitivity and diagnostic capability of this technique, however there are technical chal-lenges associated with the measurement and interpretation of this data. Recent work by the authors has demonstrated the ability of fibre Bragg gratings (FBGs) to measure wave-fields at frequencies in excess of 2 MHz [1]. However, when this work was extended to other thinner plate specimens {{it was found that}} at these higher frequencies, the cyanoacrylate adhesive (M-Bond 200) used to attach the FBG sensors to the plate was significantly affecting the propagation of the waves. Laser vibrometry was used to characterise the wave-field in the region surrounding the adhesive and {{it was found that the}} self-adhesive <b>retro-reflective</b> <b>tape</b> applied to aid with this measurement was also affecting the wave-field in the higher frequency regime. This paper reports on an experimental study into the influence of both of these materials on the propagating wave-field. Three different lengths of <b>retro-reflective</b> <b>tape</b> were placed in the path of Lamb waves propagating in an aluminium plate and laser vibrometry was used to measure the wave-field upstream and downstream of the tape for a range of different excitatio...|$|E
40|$|In 1985, {{a cohort}} of 14 {{children}} with cerebral palsy underwent a neurosurgical procedure - selective posterior rhizotomy - {{in an effort to}} reduce their spasticity. They were part of a prospective study in which their gait was analysed before surgery and at one and three years' post-operatively. In 1995, ten years after surgery, there were important questions that needed to be addressed: would their gait be different from the findings before surgery and three years after surgery and how would they compare with age-matched normal subjects? Three of the original subjects were lost to follow-up and 11 were invited to participate in this long-term study. Their ages ranged from 12 to 24 years at this time of evaluation. Their gait was studied in the sagittal plane by <b>taping</b> <b>retro-reflective</b> markers onto the greater trochanter, lateral femoral epicondyle and lateral malleolus and having the subjects walk in a direction perpendicular to a video camera recording their gait. The data were digitised and analysed making use of custom written software and all relevant gait parameters were calculated. The parameters evaluated were the ranges of motion and midrange values of the knee and thigh, and the spatial-temporal parameters, namely cadence, stride length and velocity. Data were also obtained from twelve age-matched normal control subjects. The ten-year results were compared to the pre-operative data, the data obtained from the three-year study and the normal controls. A statistical analysis was performed on these parameters by using multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) and post hoc comparisons were performed with a Scheffe test and a significance level set at p < 0. 05. Results indicated that after ten years, the joint ranges of motion and mid-range values did not differ significantly from the normal values. The values also did not vary significantly from the values obtained in the three-year follow-up study, suggesting that functional changes acquired due to rhizotomy were of long term duration. The spatial-temporal parameters, however, did differ significantly from the normal range. Although this finding may have been influenced by the environment and subject motivation, the reduced cadence and stride length meant that the cerebral palsy subjects walked slower than their normal counterparts. This project, while confirming the results of the previous subjective studies, provides the first long-term objective data that establishes the effectiveness of selective posterior rhizotomy in improving and maintaining locomotor function for children with spastic cerebral palsy...|$|R

In typical applications, a Laser Vibrometer collects a region of a speckle pattern on its photodetector. However, noise can be generated in the Laser Vibrometer output when surface motions cause changes in the speckle pattern. This paper uses high resolution images to investigate typical intensity profiles in the partially- and fully-developed speckle patterns scattered from target surfaces with roughnesses in the range 11 nm to 1 μm Ra (≈ 1 / 60 λ to 1. 6 λ) and from a surface treated with <b>retro-reflective</b> <b>tape.</b> In-plane and tilt target motions cause changes in the scattered speckle patterns and sequences of images are used to investigate how the speckle patterns behave in response to these motions. In the case of <b>retro-reflective</b> <b>tape,</b> incident beam diameter is also found to have an important effect on speckle pattern changes and different incident beam diameters are considered for other target surfaces and motions too. This qualitative analysis of the speckle pattern intensity profiles is compared with established theoretical understanding of speckle patterns and their motions and related directly to the instrument noise levels ultimately encountered. Such fundamental evaluation of speckle pattern motions provides a greater appreciation of speckle noise generation in the Laser Vibrometer outputs...|$|E

Full details of this licence are available at: [URL] Doppler vibrometry (LDV) offers an attractive solution when radial vibration measurement directly from a rotor surface is required. Research to date has demonstrated application on polished-circular rotors and rotors coated with <b>retro-reflective</b> <b>tape.</b> In the latter case, however, a significant cross-sensitivity to the orthogonal radial vibration component occurs and post-processing is required to resolve individual radial vibration components. Until now, the fundamentally different behaviour observed between these cases has stood as an inconsistency in the published literature, symptomatic {{of the need to}} understand the effect of surface roughness. This paper offers the first consistent mathematical description of the polished-circular and rough rotor behaviours, combined with an experimental investigation of the relationship between surface roughness and cross-sensitivity. Rotors with surface roughness up to 10 nm satisfy the polished-circular rotor definition if vibration displacement is below 100 % beam diameter, for a 90 μm beam, and below 40 % beam diameter, for a 520 μm beam. On rotors with roughness between 10 nm and 50 nm, the polished-circular rotor definition is satisfied for vibration displacements up to 25 % beam diameter, for a 90 μm beam, and up to 10 % beam diameter, for a 520 μm beam. As roughness increases, cross-sensitivity increases but only rotors coated in <b>retro-reflective</b> <b>tape</b> satisfied the rough rotor definition fully. Consequently, when polished-circular surfaces are not available, rotor surfaces must be treated with <b>retro-reflective</b> <b>tape</b> and measurements post-processed to resolve individual vibration components. Through simulations, the value of the resolution and correction algorithms that form the post-processor has been demonstrated quantitatively. Simulations incorporating representative instrument misalignments and measurement noise have enabled quantification of likely error levels in radial vibration measurements. On a polished-circular rotor, errors around 0. 2 % for amplitude and 2 mrad for phase are likely, rising a little at the integer orders affected by pseudo-vibration. Higher pseudo-vibration levels and the need for resolution increase errors in the rough rotor measurements, especially around the synchronous frequency where errors reach 20 % by amplitude and 100 mrad for phase. Outside a range of half an order either side of first order, errors are ten times lower and beyond fifth order errors are similar to those for the polished-circular rotor. Further simulations were performed to estimate sensitivities to axial vibration, speed variation and bending vibrations...|$|E

Radial vibration measurements taken directly from rotors using Laser Vibrometry are known to show a significant cross-sensitivity to the orthogonal radial vibration component.

40|$|Purpose The aim of {{this study}} was to {{systematically}} investigate the effect of different levels of refractive blur and driver age on night-time pedestrian recognition and determine whether clothing that has been shown to improve pedestrian conspicuity is robust to the effects of blur. Methods Night-time pedestrian recognition was measured for 24 visually normal participants (12 younger M= 24. 9 ± 4. 5 years and 12 older adults M= 77. 6 ± 5. 7 years) for three levels of binocular blur (+ 0. 50 D, + 1. 00 D, + 2. 00 D) compared to baseline (optimal refractive correction). Pedestrians walked in place on a closed road circuit and wore one of three clothing conditions: i) everyday clothing, ii) a retro-reflective vest and iii) <b>retro-reflective</b> <b>tape</b> positioned on the extremities in a configuration that conveyed biological motion (known as “biomotion”); the order of conditions was randomized between participants. Pedestrian recognition distances were recorded for each blur and pedestrian clothing combination while participants drove an instrumented vehicle around a closed road course. Results The recognition distances for pedestrians were significantly reduced (p< 0. 05) by all levels of blur compared to baseline. Pedestrians wearing “biomotion” clothing were recognized at significantly longer distances than for the other clothing configurations in all blur conditions. However, these effects were smaller for the older adults, who had much shorter recognition distances for all conditions tested. Conclusions In summary, even small amounts of blur had a significant detrimental effect on night-time pedestrian recognition. Biomotion retro-reflective clothing was effective, even under moderately degraded visibility conditions, for both young and older drivers...|$|E

This paper, intended as an essential guide for the practical parallel beam laser vibrometer practioner, presents exact mathematical expressions for measured angular velocity in the presence of inevitable misalignments and estimates the likely measurement error levels due to such misalignments as well as to other sources of uncertainty through numerical simulation. Cross-sensitivity to the orthogonal vibration component, i. e. cross-sensitivity in a pitch measurement to yaw motion and vice-versa, is confirmed for rough rotors whereas it is shown not to be present when rotors are polished-circular. A complementary experimental investigation of the relationship between surface roughness and cross-sensitivity confirms the identification of two preferred measurement configurations: from the side of a polished-circular rotor and from the end face of a (rough) rotor coated in <b>retro-reflective</b> <b>tape.</b> Rotors with surface roughness up to 50 nm satisfy the former case provided the vibration displacement at the rotor surface does not exceed 20 % beam diameter. For surfaces with roughness of 10 nm this can be extended to 50 %. For rough rotor end face measurements, post-processing is required to resolve the inherent cross-sensitivity; the need for post-processing is justified quantitatively through numerical simulation. Further simulations incorporating typical levels of instrument misalignment and measurement noise are used to enable quantification of the likely errors in such angular vibration measurements. For measurements from the side of a polished-circular rotor, errors are around 1 % for amplitude and 10 mrad at integer orders affected by pseudo-vibration and around one-third of these levels elsewhere. For measurements from a rough rotor end face, errors will be similar at integer orders (from 2). Errors in the rotational speed measurement, required for post-processing, must be minimised in order to limit errors up to 2 nd order while misalignments determine errors at around 0. 4 % amplitude and 4 mrad phase at orders above 2 other than at the integer orders...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV) is a well established technique used for non intrusive velocity measurements in fluid flows and on solid surfaces. Unlike traditional contacting vibration transducers, laser vibrometers require no physical contact with the test object. The ability to combine advanced mirror systems together with the laser source allows automated scanning LDV (SLDV) measurements, where {{a high number of}} measurement points can be measured consecutively. Non-contact vibration measurements with very high spatial resolution are possible with such a scanning system and can lead to a significantly more detailed analysis from vibration tests. One of the main limitations of Laser Vibrometry is the difficulty to realize a perfect alignment between the investigated target and the laser beam. Frequently, for engineering applications, it is desirable to investigate different points on a target using the LDV system and, in this case, accurate knowledge of the measuring point position is required. Misalignments associated with the laser beam or the optics used to deflect the beam introduce deviation from the desired position and uncertainties in the measured velocity. All optical configurations are sensitive to misalignments, especially scanning systems able to move the laser beam around static or rotating targets. This thesis describes advances in the application and interpretation of such measurements using Laser Vibrometry and concentrates on the analysis of the uncertainties due to the inevitable misalignments between the laser beam and the investigated target in vibration measurements on rotating components. The work is divided into three main sections. The first part proposes a novel method to model any kind of LDV optical arrangement suitable for vibration measurements. This model has been developed with scanning LDV systems in mind but it can be used for any optical configuration. The method is based on a vector approach and integrates directly with the Velocity Sensitivity Model to determine the velocity measured by a single incident beam. The resulting mathematical models describe completely the beam path, the scan pattern and the measured velocity in the presence/absence of target vibrations and misalignments without any kind of approximation. The mathematical expressions derived are complex but easily implemented in software such as Matlab. The models are an important tool for LDV because they help the user to {{have a better understanding of}} measured data and to make the best alignment possible. The second part of the thesis concentrates on the modelling of different optical systems using the new method. Different systems from the simplest to the most complex have been analysed using the method. For some arrangements, mathematical models have been formulated for the first time such as for the newly proposed single and dual wedge SLDV systems and for the recently introduced Dove prism SLDV system. These systems are compared to the dual mirror SLDV system. In particular, for the single and the dual wedge SLDV systems, experimental tests have been performed to validate theoretical predictions. The results confirm the validity of the models and show the potential of these systems. Established systems such as the dual mirror and the self-tracking SLDV systems, for which generally less comprehensive models can be found in literature, have been re-analysed with the new method and theoretical predictions have been compared to the data from literature in order to confirm the validity of the new models and also to investigate for the first time some details that have previously been neglected. The models enable identification of the main characteristics of any arrangement, in particular the sensitivity to typical misalignments and target vibration components. For tracking applications on rotating targets, the presence of misalignments causes measured velocities at DC and the first target rotation harmonic whose values depend on how the misalignments combine. The analysis of misalignment effects enables identification of the optical device(s) with the most critical alignment and supplies an initial estimation of the level of uncertainty affecting typical, practical applications. Investigation shows as the self-tracking scanning systems are much sensitive to misalignments and target vibrations than the other scanning systems. The third part of the thesis concentrates on effects on radial and pitch/yaw vibration measurements on rotating targets of both misalignments and surface roughness of the test rotor. It is known that radial and pitch/yaw vibrations taken directly from a rotor using LDV are affected by a cross-sensitivity to the orthogonal vibration component. Resolution of the individual radial or pitch and yaw components is possible via a particular arrangement of the laser beams and using a dedicated resolution algorithm. Error sources such as instrument misalignments, rotation speed measurement error and introduce uncertainties in the resolution algorithm output. Research has quantified these uncertainties when radial vibrations with different or equal amplitude are applied to the target. Particular attention has been given to the effects that surface roughness has on the cross-sensitivity encountered in these measurements. From the tests, it is possible to identify three different ranges of surface roughness. For very smooth circular rotors, the cross-sensitivities are negligible and measurements can be made directly on the rotor without the need for a resolution algorithm. For very rough surfaces including surfaces coated in <b>retro-reflective</b> <b>tape,</b> the measurements have to be resolved to remove the cross-sensitivity. For surface roughnesses between the very smooth and the very rough, reliable measurements cannot be made because levels of the cross-sensitivity cannot be predicted making correct resolution impossible. The significant developments in the use of Laser Vibrometry for different optical configurations and quantification of the uncertainties expected for typical applications on rotating components realised during this research project make this work a practical and important tool for the user...|$|E
