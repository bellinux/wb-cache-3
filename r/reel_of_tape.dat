50|$|After several {{attempts}} by other companies, the first commercially successful VTR, the Ampex VRX-1000, {{was introduced in}} 1956 by Ampex Corporation. At a price of US$50,000 in 1956 (over $400,000 in 2016's inflation), and US$300 (over $2,000 in 2016's inflation) for a 90-minute <b>reel</b> <b>of</b> <b>tape,</b> it was intended only for the professional market.|$|E

5000|$|They had 4 speeds: 7½ inches {{per second}} (i.p.s.), 3¾ i.p.s., 1⅞ i.p.s., and 15/16 i.p.s. With the longest variety of 5" [...] tape (1800 ft. long), and using 4-track mono at 15/16 i.p.s., it would be {{possible}} to get about 24 hours' recording time on one <b>reel</b> <b>of</b> <b>tape,</b> albeit at poor quality suitable only for speech, and 6 hours' continuous recording time would be possible.|$|E
5000|$|... 1970: The Complete Fun House Sessions was {{compiled}} from all thirteen <b>reels</b> <b>of</b> multi-track reel-to-reel <b>tape</b> that held every note and snippet of studio dialogue. Twelve <b>reels</b> <b>of</b> <b>tape</b> {{had been used}} during the sessions; the thirteenth reel {{was the one that}} held the takes that would be used for the album. In 1999, Rhino house engineers Bill Inglot and Dan Hersch mixed down every tape from end to end, placing the master takes that had been used for the master <b>reel</b> <b>of</b> the album back in their rightful position for the boxed set.|$|R

5000|$|... "It was {{recorded}} straight to quarter-inch tape - {{there were no}} overdubs and no possibility of remixing. This particular performance was also continuous for one hour which made for an interesting change over when the programme was aired since the <b>reels</b> <b>of</b> <b>tape</b> only lasted approximately 30 minutes each." [...] - Jeff Griffin, BBC in Concert series producer.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Quad" [...] head {{assembly}} rotates at 14,400 rpm (NTSC). The four head pieces (quad) are switched successively so that recorded stripes cross the video portion (most {{of the tape}} middle, audio is on one edge, control track is on the other) so that head to tape write speed is well {{in excess of the}} 15 inch per second physical motion. They wrote the video vertically across the width of a tape that was 2 inches (5 cm) wide and ran at 15 inches (38 cm) per second. This allowed hour-long television programs to be recorded on one <b>reel</b> <b>of</b> <b>tape.</b> In 1956, one <b>reel</b> <b>of</b> <b>tape</b> cost $300; and Ampex advertised the cost of the recorder as $45,000. A 7.5 inch per second version was released later, and this required a new, narrower headwheel. This vertical writing facilitated mechanical editing, once the control track was developed to display the pulse that indicates where a frame ends and the next one begins. Later, Ampex developed electronic editing.|$|E
50|$|Despite its {{convenience}} the RCA {{tape cartridge}} {{was not much}} of a success. RCA was slow to produce machines for the home market. They were also slow to license prerecorded music tapes for home playback. Cost was also an issue, with a single cartridge costing US$4.50 in 1960 ($ with inflation today) compared to a 1,200 foot <b>reel</b> <b>of</b> <b>tape,</b> which cost $3.50 ($ today). The format disappeared from retail stores by 1964.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>reel</b> <b>of</b> <b>tape</b> {{could also}} hold far more {{recorded}} information than previous mediums. For instance, Berliner's discs held {{only a few}} minutes of recording, meaning that each disc usually contained a single song, or multiple short clips. Pfleumer's tape reels, on the other hand, could hold up to thirty minutes of sound. This ability is what eventually led to the concept of a music [...] "album", or collection of multiple songs.|$|E
5000|$|Taylor {{recorded}} hundreds <b>of</b> <b>reels</b> <b>of</b> <b>tape</b> documenting {{and preserving}} bluegrass music, from [...] "kitchen recordings" [...] to live concerts, {{as well as}} serving as a recording engineer for studio albums.

5000|$|Many airchecks {{are made}} by the announcers {{themselves}} on a recorder that begins recording when the microphone is turned on and then goes into pause when the microphone goes off. In the 1960s and 1970s <b>reels</b> <b>of</b> <b>tape</b> were used for these [...] "skimmer" [...] airchecks. Later it was cassettes. Today many stations use minidiscs, recordable CDs or computer digital recordings for aircheck creation.|$|R
25|$|Murdo MacKenzie of Bing Crosby Enterprises {{had seen}} a {{demonstration}} of the German Magnetophon in June 1947—the same device that Jack Mullin had brought back from Radio Frankfurt, along with 50 <b>reels</b> <b>of</b> <b>tape,</b> {{at the end of the}} war. It was one <b>of</b> the magnetic <b>tape</b> recorders that BASF and AEG had built in Germany starting in 1935. The 6.5mm ferric-oxide-coated tape could record 20 minutes per <b>reel</b> <b>of</b> high-quality sound. Alexander M. Poniatoff ordered his Ampex company, which he'd founded in 1944, to manufacture an improved version of the Magnetophone.|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} between February and June 1996 at the now defunct Bearsville Studios in the Catskills region of New York state. Early recording started February 1, {{with the band}} intending to produce the album themselves with engineering by John Siket. The first recording project {{was an attempt to}} create a sonic [...] "blob" [...] that filled an entire <b>reel</b> <b>of</b> <b>tape.</b> Each band member contributed on several instruments. This idea was later abandoned but elements were used on the tracks [...] "Swept Away" [...] and [...] "Steep".|$|E
50|$|Combining the PDP-8 {{computer}} with the DECtape's small 4-inch (10 cm) <b>reel</b> <b>of</b> <b>tape</b> that held over 350,000 characters (versus the 25,000 characters on an MT/ST tape) and allowing random access (albeit slower) like a floppy disk, the DECtape units allowed much more flexible storage access, {{and thus the}} potential for a much more capable word processor design than the MT/ST which used a slow sprocket hole driven tape (much like a film strip) to record a single character at a time and could only read/write a maximum of 20 characters per second, and had limited search capabilities.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{format for}} magnetic tape sound reproduction was the reel-to-reel tape recorder, first {{available in the}} US in the late 1940s, but too expensive and bulky to be practical for amateur home use {{until well into the}} 1950s. Loading a <b>reel</b> <b>of</b> <b>tape</b> onto the machine and threading it through the various guides and rollers proved daunting to some casual users—certainly, it was more difficult than putting a vinyl record on a record player and flicking a switch. Because in early years each tape had to be dubbed from the master tape in real-time to maintain good sound quality, prerecorded tapes were more expensive to manufacture, and costlier to buy, than vinyl records which could be stamped much quicker than their own playing time.|$|E

25|$|In March, Radiohead {{moved to}} Medley Studios in Copenhagen for two weeks. According to O'Brien, the {{sessions}} produced about 50 <b>reels</b> <b>of</b> <b>tape</b> each containing 15 minutes of music, with nothing finished. In April, Radiohead resumed recording in a Gloucestershire mansion. The lack of deadline {{and the number}} of incomplete ideas made it hard for the band to focus, and they agreed to disband if they could not agree on an album worth releasing.|$|R
5000|$|Some radio {{stations}} used [...] "logger reels" [...] for airchecks. On these large <b>reels</b> <b>of</b> <b>tape</b> would be recorded the air signal at super-slow speeds. These reels were {{kept by the}} station for regulatory purposes (e.g. to provide an audio record that commercials ran as logged or to confirm aired content after allegations of inappropriate content). After a time, normally around 30 days for most stations, these logger reels would be reused or discarded.|$|R
50|$|The Digital Audio File {{marked the}} end of one era in {{recording}} and the beginning of another. Digital files effectively eliminated the need to create or use a discrete, purpose-made physical recording medium (a disc, or a <b>reel</b> <b>of</b> <b>tape,</b> etc.) as the primary means of capturing, manufacturing and distributing commercial sound recordings. Concurrent with the development of these digital file formats, dramatic advances in home computing and the rapid expansion of the Internet mean that digital sound recordings can now be captured, processed, reproduced, distributed and stored entirely electronically, on a range of magnetic and optical recording media, and these can be distributed almost anywhere in the world, with no loss of fidelity, and crucially, without the need to first transfer these files to some form of permanent recording medium for shipment and sale.|$|E
50|$|Early {{half-inch}} tape {{had seven}} parallel tracks of data {{along the length}} of the tape allowing, six-bit characters plus one bit of parity written across the tape. This was known as seven-track tape. With the introduction of the IBM System 360 mainframe, nine-track tapes were introduced to support the new 8-bit characters that it used. Effective recording density increased over time. Common seven-track densities started at 200, then 556, and finally 800 cpi and nine-track tapes had densities of 800 (using NRZI), 1600 (using PE), and 6250 cpi (using GCR). This translates into about 5 MB to 140 MB per standard length (2400ft) <b>reel</b> <b>of</b> <b>tape.</b> End of file was designated by a tape mark and end of tape by two tape marks. The physical beginning and end of usable tape was indicated by reflective adhesive strips of aluminum foil.|$|E
50|$|Originally, Beta I {{machines}} {{using the}} NTSC television standard {{were able to}} record one hour of programming at their standard tape speed of 1.5 inches per second (ips). The first VHS machines could record for two hours, due to both a slightly slower tape speed (1.31 ips.) and significantly longer tape. Betamax's smaller-sized cassette limited {{the size of the}} <b>reel</b> <b>of</b> <b>tape,</b> and could not compete with VHS's two-hour capability by extending the tape length. Instead, Sony had to slow the tape down to 0.787 ips (Beta II) in order to achieve two hours of recording in the same cassette size. This reduced Betamax's once-superior video quality to worse than VHS when comparing two-hour recording. Sony eventually released an extended Beta cassette (Beta III) which allowed NTSC Betamax to break the two-hour limit, but by then VHS had already won the format battle.|$|E
