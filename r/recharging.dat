40|$|<b>Recharge</b> {{can take}} two main forms, direct <b>recharge</b> from {{rainfall}} infiltrating {{the ground or}} indirect <b>recharge</b> from leakage from wadi beds. The <b>recharge</b> processes operating in the West Bank can be summarised as rainfall <b>recharge,</b> wadi <b>recharge,</b> urban <b>recharge</b> processes and irrigation losses. Rainfall <b>recharge</b> is the predominant form of <b>recharge,</b> whilst wadi <b>recharge,</b> urban and irrigation losses are only minor components. However, these minor components can be locally important. The <b>recharge</b> processes operating in the Wadi Natuf catchment are varied and complex. The four main geological strata through which <b>recharge</b> takes place are: • Jerusalam • Upper Lower Beit Kahil • Lower Beit Kahil • Hebron The main aquifer units are karstic which receive <b>recharge</b> once a wetting threshold is exceeded. This assumption is supported by field observations (Messerschmid, 2003) and a field experiment close to the study area (Lange et al., 2003). Other minor aquifers receive <b>recharge</b> and distribute water laterally to springs. Flow from springs, if not used for water supply or irrigation, can then be routed to other aquifer units or as loss from wadis. High intensity rainfall can produce overland runoff and wadi flow. Flowing wadis loose water to all but the Yatta formation. <b>Recharge</b> can, therefore, occur by two methods, direct infiltration from rainfall and from losses from wadi beds. There are four main <b>recharge</b> processes operating in the aquifers of the West Bank; 1. Direct <b>recharge</b> from rainfall 2. Indirect <b>recharge</b> from wadi losses 3. <b>Recharge</b> from urban water supply and waste water proceses 4. <b>Recharge</b> from irrigation losses The difference between rainfall and potential evaporation, known as effective rainfall, is the main control on direct <b>recharge</b> from rainfall. Rainfall is greatest {{in the north and}} west whereas potential evaporation is the highest in the south and east.

However, there are limited <b>recharge</b> {{estimates}} in this region due to the complexity of <b>recharge</b> processes and the challenge of direct observations. Land surface Models (LSMs) could be a valuable tool for estimating current <b>recharge</b> and projecting changes due to future climate change. In this study, simulations of three LSMs (Noah, Mosaic and VIC) obtained from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS- 2) are used to estimate potential <b>recharge</b> in the western US. Modeled <b>recharge</b> was compared with published <b>recharge</b> estimates for several aquifers in the region. Annual <b>recharge</b> to precipitation ratios across the study basins varied from 0. 01 % to 15 % for Mosaic, 3. 2 % to 42 % for Noah, and 6. 7 % to 31. 8 % for VIC simulations. Mosaic consistently underestimates <b>recharge</b> across all basins. Noah captures <b>recharge</b> reasonably well in wetter basins, but overestimates it in drier basins.

When market penetration of plug-in electric vehicles begins to reach significant levels, utilities will have to invest in improvements for local electrical grids in order to handle the additional loads related to <b>recharging</b> to avoid blackouts due to grid overload.

The global studies lack the specificity to inform decision making, while the local studies do little to clarify potential changes over large regions (major river basins, states, or groups of states), a scale often important {{in the development of}} water policy. An analysis of the potential impact of climate change on groundwater <b>recharge</b> across the western United States (west of 100 degrees longitude) is presented synthesizing existing studies and applying current knowledge of <b>recharge</b> processes and amounts. Eight representative aquifers located across the region were evaluated. For each aquifer published <b>recharge</b> budget components were converted into four standard <b>recharge</b> mechanisms: diffuse, focused, irrigation, and mountain-systems <b>recharge.</b> Future changes in individual <b>recharge</b> mechanisms and total <b>recharge</b> were then estimated for each aquifer. Model-based studies of projected climate-change effects on <b>recharge</b> were available and utilized for half of the aquifers. For the remainder, forecasted changes in temperature and precipitation were logically propagated through each <b>recharge</b> mechanism producing qualitative estimates of direction of changes in <b>recharge</b> only (not magnitude). Several key patterns emerge from the analysis.

Major conduit flow networks were found to exist within the aquifer and their groundwater flow paths could be traced. Urban development of the Edwards <b>recharge</b> zone was shown to decrease the volume of <b>recharge</b> and degrade the aquifer’s water quality. No significant detrimental effects on the aquifer were observed. The volume of diminished <b>recharge</b> and the concentration of <b>recharged</b> contaminants that were necessary to produce significant adverse effects on the aquifer were not determined due to lack of precipitation during the study period and inconclusive groundwater tracings. It was recommended that further development of the <b>recharge</b> zone be suspended until the effects of urbanization are quantified...|$|R
