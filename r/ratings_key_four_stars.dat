5000|$|James Ferguson of HorrorTalk gave Locke & <b>Key</b> <b>four</b> <b>stars</b> (out of five) and said, [...] "The acting {{throughout}} the episode is fantastic. You really {{feel for the}} Locke family {{as they attempt to}} recover from this horrible event in their lives. McCartney and Bolger have great chemistry as brother and sister, playing off of one another very well. Unfortunately for them, young Skylar Gertner steals every scene he's in. In many ways, he is the star of the pilot as he's the catalyst for Dodge's release from her prison as well as the search for the keys. Sometimes it takes a child's imagination to look past the restrictions most of us place on our thoughts, {{especially when it comes to}} the supernatural. The story unfolds with subtlety. We're not shown the exact events regarding Rendell's death, but we're given hints as to what happened based on the character's actions and emotions. It isn't until much later that we're given the details as well as why one of the family members feels responsible. Obviously I don't know how faithful the pilot is to the original comic, but the setup that we get from this episode would have been great for a weekly program. There's a nice reveal at the very end that would create the basis for at least a full season".|$|R
40|$|We have {{detected}} <b>four</b> new HgMn <b>stars,</b> while monitoring {{a sample of}} apparently slowly rotating superficially normal bright late B and early A stars in the northern hemisphere. Important classification lines of Hg II and Mn II are found as conspicuous features in the high resolution SOPHIE spectra of these stars (R = 75000). Several lines of Hg II, Mn II and Fe II have been synthesized using model atmospheres and the spectrum synthesis code SYNSPEC 48 including hyperfine structure of various isotopes when relevant. These synthetic spectra have been compared to high resolution high signal-to-noise observations of these stars in order to derive abundances of these <b>key</b> elements. The <b>four</b> <b>stars</b> are found to have distinct enhancements of Hg and Mn which show that these stars are not superficially normal B and A stars, but actually are new HgMn stars and should reclassified as such.
