Recent activity has mostly shifted to Kīlauea's eastern <b>rift</b> <b>zone,</b> the site of 24 historical eruptions, located mostly on its upper section; by contrast, the volcano's southwestern <b>rift</b> <b>zone</b> has been relatively quiet, and has only been the site of five events to date.|$|E

5|$|Lava {{flows from}} Mauna Kea {{overlapped}} in complex layers {{with those of}} its neighbors during its growth. Most prominently, Mauna Kea is built upon older flows from Kohala to the northwest, and intersects the base of Mauna Loa to the south. The original eruptive fissures (rift zones) in the flanks of Mauna Kea were buried by its post-shield volcanism. Hilo Ridge, a prominent underwater <b>rift</b> <b>zone</b> structure east of Mauna Kea, was once {{believed to be a}} part of the volcano; however, it is now understood to be a <b>rift</b> <b>zone</b> of Kohala that has been affected by younger Mauna Kea flows.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSeveral {{patterns}} of magma paths {{have been proposed}} since the 1980 s for Piton de la Fournaise volcano. Given the significant differences, which are presented here, we propose a reappraisal of the magma intrusion paths using a 17 -years-long database of volcano-tectonic seismic events and a detailed mapping of the scoria cones. At the edifice scale, the magma propagates along two N 120 trending <b>rift</b> <b>zones.</b> They are wide, linear, spotted by small to large scoria cones and related lava flows and involving magma resulting from high-pressure fractionation of ol ± cpx and presents an eruption periodicity of around 200 years over the last 30 kiloyears. The upper plumbing system originates {{at the base of}} the edifice below the Enclos Fouqué caldera. It feeds frequent (1 eruption every 9 months on average), short-lived summit and distal (flank) eruptions along summit and outer <b>rift</b> <b>zones,</b> respectively. Summit <b>rift</b> <b>zones</b> are short and present an orthogonal pattern restricted to the central active cone of Piton de la Fournaise whereas outer <b>rift</b> <b>zones</b> extend from inside the Enclos Fouqué caldera to the NE and SE volcano flanks. To sum up, <b>rift</b> <b>zones</b> of Piton de la Fournaise present strong geometrical and dynamical differences. On the one hand, the lower plumbing system feeds <b>rift</b> <b>zones</b> showing striking similarities to those developed in Hawaii during the alkaline postshield stage. On the other hand, the <b>rift</b> <b>zones</b> connected to upper plumbing system can be compared the rift system of Mount Etna, whose dynamics is know to be linked with the lateral displacement of the east flank...|$|R

5|$|The {{length and}} origin these eruptions has also varied. Events last {{anywhere}} between days and years, and occur {{at a number}} of different sites. Half of all eruptions occur at or near Kīlauea's summit caldera. Activity there was nearly continuous for much of the 19th century, and after a reprieve between 1894 and 1907, continued onwards until 1924. There have been five historical eruptions at the volcano's relatively southwestern <b>rift</b> <b>zone,</b> and 24 along its more active eastern <b>rift</b> <b>zone,</b> mostly along its upper section.|$|E
5|$|The {{windward}} {{side of the}} Kohala mountains is dissected by multiple, deeply eroded stream valleys in a southwest-northeast alignment, cutting into the flanks of the volcano. North of Kohala's summit the volcano's northwest-southeast trending <b>rift</b> <b>zone</b> separates rainfall into two streams, going southeast, into Waipio Valley, or northwest, into Honokane Nui Valley. When the volcano was still active, vertical sheets of magma, arranged in {{what is known as}} dikes, forced {{their way out of the}} magma reservoir and intruded into the <b>rift</b> <b>zone,</b> which was weakened by the collapse. As the dikes forced their way up, they formed fractures and faults parallel to the <b>rift</b> <b>zone.</b> The exertion caused by the dikes produced a series of faults along its length, forming horsts and grabens (fault blocks). Northeast of the Kohala summit, where the most rainfall occurs, the faulted structure prevents summit rainwater from naturally flowing northeast down the mountain slope. Instead, the rainwater flows down laterally and empties into the back of what have thus become the largest valleys (Waipio and Honokane Nui).|$|E
5|$|Leftover {{heat from}} this hot spot was later liberated by Basin and Range-associated rifting {{and created the}} many {{overlapping}} lava flows {{that make up the}} Lava Beds of Idaho.

5|$|After the Rove sediments were deposited, the Penokean orogeny {{added more}} land mass by {{accretion}} that occurred from the south. A few {{hundred million years}} later the proto-North American continent nearly split in half along the Midcontinent <b>Rift</b> <b>zone,</b> which is a bow-shaped rift extending from northeast Kansas, arcing through the present-day Lake Superior Basin and then angling southeast through Michigan. Then came a period of advancing and retreating glaciers. The more resistant diabase sills and dikes remained, while the softer shales were bulldozed away by the glaciers. The north path of glaciation is transverse to the general trend on the valleys and ridges.|$|E
5|$|Kohala had two active rift zones, a {{characteristic}} common to Hawaiian volcanoes. The double ridge, shaped axially, {{was active in}} both the shield and postshield stages. The southeast <b>rift</b> <b>zone</b> passes under the nearby Mauna Kea and reappears further southeast in the Hilo Ridge, {{as indicated by the}} relationship between collected lava samples. In addition, the two features align to one another more closely then does the ridge to Mauna Kea, of which it was once thought to constitute a part. The bulk of the ridge is built of volcanic rock with reverse magnetic polarity, evidence that the volcano is at least 780,000years old. Older lava dated from the toe of the ridge was estimated to be roughly between 1.1 and 1.2million years old.|$|E
5|$|In Kohala, the {{numerous}} dikes near the summit inhibit groundwater from seeping downslope to the northeast, where it naturally wants to go. Rather, the Kohala dike complex guides it northwest or southeast, down {{the axis of}} the rift zones, just like the surface water. On the other hand, the three smaller valleys between the large ones - Honopue, Honokea, and Honokane Iki - {{as well as the}} many smaller gulches which are not yet valleys, are deprived of groundwater by the orientation of the <b>rift</b> <b>zone</b> and its dikes. Without the large amount of water that is received by the bigger valleys, these valleys grow far more slowly. Due to its topography as essentially a flat crater floor surrounded by cones and fault scarps, the main caldera is affected relatively little by erosion from water.|$|E

5|$|Like other Iskut-Unuk River Cones, The Volcano has {{its origins}} in {{continental}} rifting—a long rupture in the Earth's crust where the lithosphere is being pulled apart. This incipient rifting has formed {{as a result of}} the Pacific Plate sliding northward along the Queen Charlotte Fault, on its way to the Aleutian Trench. As the continental crust stretches, the near surface rocks fracture along steeply dipping cracks parallel to the rift known as faults. Basaltic magma rises along these fractures to create effusive eruptions. The <b>rift</b> <b>zone</b> has existed for at least 14.9million years, and has created the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. Several dormant volcanoes in the province are potentially active, with The Volcano being one of the three having erupted in the last few hundred years. Tseax Cone, which last erupted in the 18th century, is the southernmost volcano in the province, while Prindle Volcano in easternmost-central Alaska, which erupted more than 10,000years ago, is generally considered the northernmost.|$|E
5|$|Over time Surtseyan eruptions tend to form maars, broad low-relief {{volcanic}} craters {{dug into}} the ground, and tuff rings, circular structures built of rapidly quenched lava. These structures {{are associated with a}} single vent eruption, however if eruptions arise along fracture zones a <b>rift</b> <b>zone</b> may be dug out; these eruptions tend to be more violent then the ones forming a tuff ring or maars, an example being the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera. Littoral cones are another hydrovolcanic feature, generated by the explosive deposition of basaltic tephra (although they are not truly volcanic vents). They form when lava accumulates within cracks in lava, superheats and explodes in a steam explosion, breaking the rock apart and depositing it on the volcano's flank. Consecutive explosions of this type eventually generate the cone.|$|E
5|$|Kīlauea's {{high state}} of {{activity}} {{has a major}} impact on its mountainside ecology, where plant growth is often interrupted by fresh tephra and drifting volcanic sulfur dioxide, producing acid rains particularly in a barren area south of its southwestern <b>rift</b> <b>zone</b> known as the Kaʻū Desert. Nonetheless, wildlife flourishes where left undisturbed elsewhere on the volcano and is highly endemic thanks to Kīlauea's (and the island of Hawaii's) isolation from the nearest landmass. Historically, the five volcanoes on the island were considered sacred by the Hawaiian people, and in Hawaiian mythology Kīlauea's Halemaumau Crater served as the body and home of Pele, goddess of fire, lightning, wind, and volcanoes. William Ellis, a missionary from England, gave the first modern account of Kīlauea and spent two weeks traveling along the volcano; since its foundation by Thomas Jaggar in 1912, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, located on the rim of Kīlauea caldera, has served as the principal investigative and scientific body on the volcano and the island in general. In 1916, a bill forming the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson; since then, the park has become a World Heritage Site and a major tourist destination, attracting roughly 2.6 million people annually.|$|E

50|$|When {{a volcano}} is created near the Hawaiian hotspot, it begins its {{growth in the}} {{submarine}} preshield stage, characterized by infrequent, typically low volume eruptions. The volcano is steep-sided, and it usually has a defined caldera and has two or more <b>rift</b> <b>zones</b> radiating from the summit. The type of lava erupted in this stage of activity is alkali basalt. Due to stretching forces, the development {{of two or more}} <b>rift</b> <b>zones</b> is common.

5|$|Mauna Loa {{has been}} {{designated}} a Decade Volcano, one of the sixteen volcanoes identified by the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior (IAVCEI) as being worthy of particular study {{in light of their}} history of large, destructive eruptions and proximity to populated areas. The United States Geological Survey maintains a hazard zone mapping of the island done on a one to nine scale, with the most dangerous areas corresponding the smallest numbers. Based on this classification Mauna Loa's continuously active summit caldera and rift zones have been given a level one designation. Much of the area immediately surrounding the rift zones is considered level two, and about 20 percent of the area has been covered in lava in historical times. Much of the remainder of the volcano is hazard level three, about 15 to 20 percent of which has been covered by flows within the last 750 years. However, two sections of the volcano, the first in the Naalehu area and the second on the southeastern flank of Mauna Loa's <b>rift</b> <b>zone,</b> are protected from eruptive activity by local topography, and have thus been designated hazard level 6, comparable with a similarly isolated segment on Kīlauea.|$|E

For the <b>rift</b> <b>zones,</b> a tectonic model is suggested in which {{the properties of the}} shelf sediments were considered. A paleogeographic scenario is proposed for the formation of negative neotectonic structures in the area. On the basis of the paleogeographic scenario and the suggested model, a mathematical simulation of the long term dynamics of permafrost and the gas hydrate stability zone on the shelf has been performed for the last 400. 000 years. As a result of the long-term evolution of permafrost within the <b>rift</b> <b>zones,</b> pocket-like (dome-shaped) structures similar to anticlines have been formed at the base of permafrost as well as open endogenic subsea taliks. It is assumed, that the anticlinal structures act as traps for sub-permafrost gases and their hydrates, whereas the open taliks serve as channels for their emission. With the results obtained it is possible to predict the conditions of formation of anticlinal traps and open taliks in the <b>rift</b> <b>zones</b> and their relation to the periodical drying or submergence of the shelf...|$|R

25|$|The {{source of}} the January 11 {{earthquake}} is debated. Some catalogues give an onshore epicentre without any direct association with a known structure, while others propose that the source was offshore due to the associated tsunami, involving either rupture along a normal fault, part of the Siculo-Calabrian <b>rift</b> <b>zone,</b> or rupture along the subduction zone beneath the Ionian Sea. An analysis {{of the distribution of}} tsunami run-ups along the coast suggests that a submarine landslide triggered by the earthquake is the most likely source, in which case the tsunami provides no constraint on the epicenter. A landslide origin is supported by the observation of possible landslide bodies along the Hyblean-Malta escarpment.|$|E
25|$|Many {{thousand}} years of dormancy are expected between large explosive eruptions of volcanoes in the Garibaldi Belt. A {{possible explanation for the}} lower rates of volcanism in the Garibaldi chain is that the associated terrain is being compressed in contrast to the more southern portions of the Cascade Arc. In continental rift zones, magma is able to push its way up through the Earth's crust rapidly along faults, providing less chance for differentiation. This is likely the case south of Mount Hood to the California border and east-southeast of the massive Newberry shield volcano adjacent to the Cascade Range in central Oregon because the Brothers Fault Zone lies in this region. This <b>rift</b> <b>zone</b> might explain the massive amounts of basaltic lava {{in this part of the}} central Cascade Arc. A low convergence rate in a compressional setting with massive stationary bodies of magma under the surface could explain the low volume and differentiated magmas throughout the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. In 1958, Canadian volcanologist Bill Mathews proposed there could be a connection between regional glaciation of the North American continent during glacial periods and higher rates of volcanic activity during regional glacial unload of the continent. However, this is hard to predict due to the infrequent geological record in this region. But there is specific data, including the temporal grouping of eruptions synglacially or just postglacial within the Garibaldi Belt, that suggests this could be probable.|$|E
