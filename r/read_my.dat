5|$|In 2001, English singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor {{covered the}} song for her debut studio album <b>Read</b> <b>My</b> Lips. It served as her debut solo single after being signed by Polydor Records. Her version {{contains}} new lyrics and a disco-tinged instrumental, and elicited a mostly positive response from critics; it also enjoyed commercial success. However, Cher was reportedly critical of this version, finding its lyrics too overtly sexual.|$|E
5|$|Her solo debut album, <b>Read</b> <b>My</b> Lips, was {{released}} in September 2001. The album reached number two on the UK Albums Chart and was certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). The record experienced international success; it sold more than 1.5 million albums worldwide. It produced four singles, three of which reached the top three in the UK. Ellis-Bextor's second album, Shoot from the Hip, {{was released}} in October 2003. The album reached number nineteen in the UK and produced two top ten singles. Trip the Light Fantastic, her third album, {{was released in}} May 2007. It album reached number seven in the UK. The album produced three singles, one of which reached the top ten in the UK.|$|E
25|$|If you <b>read</b> <b>my</b> book, {{you find}} a certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E

500|$|... "Take Me Home" [...] (also {{known as}} [...] "Take Me Home (A Girl Like Me)") {{was covered by}} English {{recording}} artist Sophie Ellis-Bextor for her debut studio album <b>Read</b> <b>My</b> Lips (2001). It contains rewritten lyrics by Ellis-Bextor, while production {{and a number of}} tasks were handled by British musician Damian LeGassick. It was released by Polydor Records as a digital download and a CD single on 13 August 2001 alongside a remix and B-side track [...] "Sparkle".|$|E
500|$|Jerry Goldsmith, {{who scored}} Donner's The Omen, was {{originally}} set to compose Superman. Portions of Goldsmith's work from Capricorn One {{were used in}} Supermans teaser trailer. He dropped out over scheduling conflicts and John Williams was hired. Williams conducted the London Symphony Orchestra to record the soundtrack. The music {{was one of the}} last pieces to come into place. Williams liked that the film did not take itself too seriously and that it had a theatrical camp feel to it. Kidder was supposed to sing [...] "Can You <b>Read</b> <b>My</b> Mind?," [...] the lyrics to which were written by Leslie Bricusse, but Donner disliked it and changed it to a composition accompanied by a voiceover. Maureen McGovern eventually recorded the single, [...] "Can You <b>Read</b> <b>My</b> Mind?," [...] in 1979, although the song did not appear on the film soundtrack. [...] It became a mid-chart hit on the Billboard Hot 100 that year (#52), spending three weeks at number five on the U.S. Adult Contemporary chart, as well as making lesser appearances on the corresponding Canadian charts. [...] It was also a very minor hit on the U.S. Country chart, reaching #93. [...] The score earned John Williams an Academy Award nomination, but he lost to Giorgio Moroder's score for Midnight Express.|$|E
500|$|After {{releasing}} {{her debut}} single [...] "Take Me Home", Polydor Records issued her first studio album <b>Read</b> <b>My</b> Lips on 27 August 2001 which primarily tended towards a disco and electronica-inspired sound. The album and its reissue spawned four singles, including the worldwide success [...] "Murder on the Dancefloor". On 16 October 2003 Ellis-Bextor released her sophomore studio album Shoot from the Hip. For the album, Ellis-Bextor worked with many musicians, including Alex James and Bernard Butler, {{which resulted in}} a Europop-influenced sound. It spawned the successful singles [...] "Mixed Up World" [...] and [...] "I Won't Change You", which reached the top 10 of the UK Singles Chart.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Poker Face" [...] is {{all about}} sexual {{innuendo}} and teasing. According to Daily Star, the chorus repeats two alternating lyrics. After the hook [...] "Can't <b>read</b> <b>my</b> Poker Face" [...] the backup singer says [...] "He's got me like nobody" [...] {{and then in the}} next line says [...] "She's got me like nobody". Gaga explained in an interview with them that the line carries a bit of an undertone of confusion about love and sex. However, the liner notes from the album booklet indicate both these lines only repeat [...] "she's got me like nobody". According to BBC, the [...] "Mum-mum-mum-mah" [...] hook used in the song references Boney M.'s 1977 hit [...] "Ma Baker".|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Alanna Nash {{also gave}} the album {{positive}} feedback, viewing the album to have [...] "enough boiling rhythms and brooding melodies {{to reflect the}} anger and disillusionment {{of the middle class}} in the '90s", calling the track [...] "She Thinks His Name Was John" [...] to be the best example of that idea. The song was eventually spawned as a single and was considered controversial for its storyline, which described a woman who contracts AIDS from a one-night stand. Due to its subject matter, the song garnered less of a response from radio and peaked at No. 15. <b>Read</b> <b>My</b> Mind became another major seller for McEntire and her label, selling three million copies by 1995 and certifying at 3× Multi-Platinum from the RIAA.|$|E
500|$|There is {{a popular}} {{misconception}} that Prescott was completely blind, {{which seems to have}} stemmed from a misunderstanding of his comment in the preface to The Conquest of Mexico, in which he stated, [...] "Nor have I ever corrected, or even <b>read,</b> <b>my</b> own original draft". The myth was further propagated by a contemporary New York review of the Conquest, and has been a common theme in popular accounts of his work. Other related embellishments of Prescott's disability have also occurred—Samuel Eliot Morison, writing in a 1959 article for The Atlantic Monthly, claimed that Prescott had an artificial eye, although {{there is no evidence to}} suggest this. It has been argued that Prescott's biographers have naturally been drawn to romanticize his life due to Prescott's own romantic style of history.|$|E

500|$|Murasaki {{disliked the}} men at court whom she thought to be drunken and stupid. However, some scholars, such as Waley, are certain she was {{involved}} romantically with Michinaga. At the least, Michinaga pursued her and pressured her strongly, and her flirtation with him is recorded in her diary as late as 1010. Yet, she wrote {{to him in a}} poem, [...] "You have neither <b>read</b> <b>my</b> book, nor won my love." [...] In her diary she records having to avoid advances from Michinaga—one night he sneaked into her room, stealing a newly written chapter of Genji. However, Michinaga's patronage was essential if she was to continue writing. Murasaki described his daughter's court activities: the lavish ceremonies, the complicated courtships, the [...] "complexities of the marriage system", and in elaborate detail, the birth of Shōshi's two sons.|$|E
500|$|Her eighteenth studio {{release was}} 1994's <b>Read</b> <b>My</b> Mind. The album spawned five major hit singles onto the Billboard Country chart, {{including}} the No. 1 single [...] "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter". The further releases ("Till You Love Me", [...] "Why Haven't I Heard from You", and [...] "And Still") became Top 10 singles {{on the same}} chart, with [...] "Till You Love Me" [...] also reaching No. 78 on the Billboard Hot 100, a chart {{that she had not}} previously entered. The album itself reached No. 2 on both the Billboard 200 and Top Country Albums charts. Charlotte Dillon of Allmusic gave the album four out of five stars, calling it [...] "another wonderful offering of songs performed by the gifted country singer Reba McEntire". Dillon also felt that the album's material had [...] "a little soul, a little swing, and some pop, too".|$|E
500|$|Rhodes {{came up with}} an {{idea for}} the backing track in the car while he was going to the studio. He started playing with the Roland Jupiter 8 keyboard, while singer Simon Le Bon was working with the lyrics. The lyrics were {{inspired}} by Little Red Riding Hood, and the repeating of the word [...] "do" [...] {{at the end of each}} verse takes its melody from the instrumentals in Gordon Lightfoot's song [...] "If You Could <b>Read</b> <b>My</b> Mind". Andy Taylor worked out a Marc Bolan-ish guitar part, a very Marshall-sounding Les Paul guitar lick that was added to the track. Then the bass and drums were added, and the whole track was finished that day, including Le Bon's vocal melody and lyrics. The laugh at the beginning of the song and the screams during the song's fade-out were performed and recorded live by Rhodes' girlfriend at the time.|$|E

500|$|... "The Same Old Story" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. TV Squad writer Jane Boursaw thought the episode seemed [...] "all over the place", and wasn't {{sure what to}} think. She stated the two most interesting parts of the episode were when Walter removed the girl's eye in order to identity her killer, and the cliffhanger at the very end, when Walter states [...] "If you've <b>read</b> <b>my</b> file, then you know the truth about Peter's medical history". Travis Fickett of IGN thought {{it was better than}} the pilot; though it was [...] "laden with lots of clunky exposition and clichéd dialogue," [...] Fickett understood that it was needed to acquaint new viewers to the show. Fickett concluded his review by saying Fringe {{has the potential to be}} a [...] "great show", and he also praised the production level as [...] "top notch", and Torv's performance as [...] "very good" [...] as she [...] "brings a unique presence to the show". The A.V. Club critic Noel Murray gave the episode a C+, while Television Without Pity graded it with a B.|$|E
500|$|On November 24, 2015, Frusciante {{announced}} that he was releasing free unreleased songs dating from 2008-2013 on his own official Bandcamp and SoundCloud pages. He also debunked the interview about him retiring from the music industry, saying that his words were taken out of context. The announcement was made via Frusciante's rarely updated website in an open letter titled [...] "Hello audience," [...] where Frusciante provides an in-depth response to the reporter who, according to him, misquoted him. He writes, [...] "I also must clear something up. I normally don’t <b>read</b> <b>my</b> press, but I heard about this quote, recently taken out of context by some lame website and made into a headline, in which I said 'I have no audience'. This has been misinterpreted, and by no fault of the excellent journalist who interviewed me for the fine publication Electronic Beats. [...] Obviously I have a public audience. I am aware of them, and they know who they are." [...] He continues, [...] "Reduced to a single sentence, it would have been accurate to say that, at this point, I have no particular audience in mind while I am making music." ...|$|E
500|$|After being heavily {{recruited}} by several colleges around the country, Solo attended the University of Washington from 1999 to 2002 where she majored in speech communications. With the Huskies, she switched permanently to goalkeeper under {{the lead of}} head coach Lesle Gallimore and goalkeeper coach and former national team player, Amy Griffin. Solo described the transition in her memoir, [...] "In high school, I had been the forward who won games. It was a huge mental adjustment to learn that {{my job was to}} save games. To anticipate what was needed. Before, I would stand in goal, the ball would come toward me, and I'd use my athletic ability to make the save. But thanks to Amy's tutelage and my time with the national team, I was becoming a much better tactical goalkeeper. I learned how to <b>read</b> <b>my</b> opponents' runs toward goal, how to position my defenders, how to see the angles... The intellectual side also made goalkeeping so much more interesting. It wasn't just ninety minutes of waiting for my defense to make a mistake. It was ninety minutes of tactics and strategy. The personality traits that had been shaped by my childhood—resilience and toughness—were assets at the position." ...|$|E

500|$|Casting for Desperate Housewives {{began in}} February 2004. Director Charles McDougall {{reported}} seeing around 150 [...] "very good and determined women" [...] audition {{for the four}} leads. Eva Longoria was the first actor cast in a lead role, landing the role of Gabrielle Solis, a materialistic ex-model, after two auditions. Longoria, an unknown soap opera actress at the time, stated that prior to her audition, she had not read the entire script. She recounted, [...] "Marc Cherry asks, 'So {{what did you think}} of the script?' like the whole thing. And I said, 'Well I didn’t read the script. I only <b>read</b> <b>my</b> part.' And Marc Cherry goes, 'I knew you were Gabrielle at that moment because it was such a Gabrielle thing to say.'" [...] Roselyn Sánchez also auditioned for the role. Teri Hatcher was cast in the role of Susan Mayer, a single mother looking for love, after a second audition for ABC network executives. Cherry commended Hatcher's audition, calling it [...] "the best audition I've ever seen in network [...]" [...] Actors originally considered for the role include Courteney Cox, Calista Flockhart, Mary-Louise Parker, and Sela Ward. Julia Louis-Dreyfus also expressed interest in the role, but network executives felt she was not right for the part.|$|E
500|$|MTV {{columnist}} Josh Wigler {{was disappointed}} with the presumed alien storyline and believed {{it to be a}} [...] "weak episode". Despite liking actor Lance Reddick, Wigler was displeased with his character's increased screentime, believing Broyles works better as an [...] "enigmatic figure". Wigler did however praise the villain's [...] "murderous method of choice", writing [...] "Those who've <b>read</b> <b>my</b> Fringe reviews know that I'm not big on the mystery-of-the-week element, but I have to give this episode some credit for at least making it look good." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 8.0/10, noting the [...] "great work" [...] done with the CGI and props {{while at the same time}} acknowledging the opening was not [...] "particularly exciting". Isler praised Reddick's performance, but continued [...] "besides the Broyles characterization, this episode kind of fell flat. The plot unfolds slowly, and the first sixty percent of this episode is kind of a yawner. The only things that really spice up the story are Walter's antics (which are very amusing, as usual). The monster of the week, an alien stowing away in a Russian cosmonaut's body, isn't all that scary or even malevolent (it's just trying to stay alive by feeding on radiation)." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} a brief {{introduction}} in which Eminem says while the chorus plays underneath, [...] "Yeh, it's been a ride. I guess I {{had to go to}} that place to get to this one." [...] When he begins the first verse, his lyrics threaten people who have looked down on him: [...] "You can try to <b>read</b> <b>my</b> lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em/ But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em." [...] On the second verse, Eminem says that he has indeed made mistakes, commenting on his Relapse album: [...] "That last Relapse CD was ehh/ Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground/ Relax, I ain't going to do that now." [...] When he says [...] "All I'm trying to say is get back, click clack, pow", a gunshot is heard. Approaching {{the end of the second}} verse, Eminem raps about his personal experiences: [...] "But I think I'm still trying to figure this crap out/ Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't/ It's time to exercise these demons/ These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now." [...] After the chorus, Eminem sings a bridge and focuses on a positive change, as he says [...] "I just can't keep living this way, so starting today I'm breaking out of this cage." [...] Before the final chorus, he says that he [...] "shoots for the moon". The song features a choir composed of Kip Blackshire, Christal Garrick II, Terry Dexter, Rich King, Kristen Ashley Cole and Sly Jordan.|$|E
