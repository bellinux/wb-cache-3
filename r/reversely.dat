500|$|Engs {{notes that}} missionaries {{struggled}} {{to reconcile the}} task of assimilating discriminated peoples into a society that defined itself by that active discrimination. Engs portrays Armstrong as a natural politician, administrator, and [...] "risk-taker" [...] who sought broad-based support from opposed parties, including African Americans, the [...] "anti-Negro white South", and white philanthropists of the North, which made Armstrong into a [...] "master prevaricator". As a [...] "realist", Armstrong adopted the subtleties of his patrons to keep Hampton open, and did not confuse [...] "the uplift of African Americans" [...] with [...] "promoting their equality with whites". Hampton's curriculum was ultimately set by federal and donor money. In time, Armstrong's goals for the school were derailed by increased costs and the school's Northern industrialist backers, who made manual labor education the focus {{and end of the}} curriculum, rather than a means. Engs concludes that Armstrong's black graduates lived in better circumstances than their peers. Many became teachers in the South and were [...] "grateful" [...] for their opportunities. <b>Reversely,</b> Hampton's Native American graduates suffered in health at the school and had little job opportunity back out West. Engs also concluded that Armstrong's work was limited by his reliance on the elite, emphasis on white men deciding black lives, and inability to change his philosophy when his assumptions became outdated. Still, Engs thought that Armstrong succeeded in his intent to [...] "civilize" [...] students at Hampton, though this mattered little, Engs wrote, when white society was unprepared to accept them [...] "no matter how civilized they might be".|$|E

60|$|The {{difference}} between these two functions of a government is not, like that between Order and Progress, a difference merely in degree, but in kind. We must not, however, suppose that they have no intimate connection with one another. The institutions which insure the best management of public affairs practicable in the existing state of cultivation tend by this alone to the further improvement of that state. A people which had the most just laws, the purest and most efficient judicature, the most enlightened administration, the most equitable and least onerous system of finance, compatible with the stage it had attained in moral and intellectual advancement, would be in a fair way to pass rapidly into a higher stage. Nor is there any mode in which political institutions can contribute more effectually to the improvement of the people than by doing their more direct work well. And <b>reversely,</b> if their machinery is so badly constructed that they do their own particular business ill, the effect is felt in a thousand ways in lowering the morality and deadening the intelligence and activity of the people. But the distinction is nevertheless real, because this {{is only one of the}} means by which political institutions improve or deteriorate the human mind, and the causes and modes of that beneficial or injurious influence remain a distinct and much wider subject of study.|$|E
60|$|Bud-variation is, also, {{important}} {{under our}} present point of view, in some few cases, as {{when all the}} eyes on the same tuber of the potato, or all the fruit on the same plum-tree, or all the flowers on the same plant, have suddenly varied in the same manner, {{it might be argued}} that the variation had been definitely caused by some change in the conditions to which the plants had been exposed; yet, in other cases, such an admission is extremely difficult. As new characters sometimes appear by bud-variation, which do not occur in the parent-species or in any allied species, we may reject, at least in these cases, the idea that they are due to reversion. Now it is well worth while to reflect maturely on some striking case of bud-variation, for instance that of the peach. This tree has been cultivated by the million {{in various parts of the}} world, has been treated differently, grown on its own roots and grafted on various stocks, planted as a standard, trained against a wall, or under glass; yet each bud of each sub-variety keeps true to its kind. But occasionally, at long intervals of time, a tree in England, or under the widely different climate of Virginia, produces a single bud, and this yields a branch which ever afterwards bears nectarines. Nectarines differ, as every one knows, from peaches in their smoothness, size, and flavour; and the difference is so great that some botanists have maintained that they are specifically distinct. So permanent are the characters thus suddenly acquired, that a nectarine produced by bud-variation has propagated itself by seed. To guard against the supposition that there is some fundamental distinction between bud and seminal variation, it is well to bear in mind that nectarines have likewise been produced from the stone of the peach; and, <b>reversely,</b> peaches from the stone of the nectarine. Now is it possible to conceive external conditions more closely alike than those to which the buds on the same tree are exposed? Yet one bud alone, out of the many thousands borne by the same tree, has suddenly, without any apparent cause, produced a nectarine. But the case is even stronger than this, for the same flower-bud has yielded a fruit, one-half or one-quarter a nectarine, and the other half or three-quarters a peach. Again, seven or eight varieties of the peach have yielded by bud-variation nectarines: the nectarines thus produced, no doubt, differ a little from one another; but still they are nectarines. Of course there must be some cause, internal or external, to excite the peach-bud to change its nature; but I cannot imagine a class of facts better adapted to force on our minds the conviction that what we call the external conditions of life are in many cases quite insignificant in relation to any particular variation, in comparison with the organisation or constitution of the being which varies.|$|E

5000|$|Both APDs and SPADs are <b>reversely</b> biased {{semiconductor}} p-n junctions. However, APDs are biased close to, but {{not exceeding}} the breakdown voltage of the semiconductor. This high electric field provides an internal multiplication gain {{only on the}} order of few hundreds, since the avalanche process is not diverging as in SPADs. The resulting avalanche current intensity is linearly related to the optical signal intensity. A SPAD, however, operates with a bias voltage above the breakdown voltage. Because the device is operating in this unstable above-breakdown regime, a single photon (or a single dark-current electron) can set off a significant avalanche of electrons. Practically, this means that in an APD a single photon produces only tens or few hundreds of electrons, but in a SPAD a single photon triggers a current in the milliampere region (billions of billions of electrons per second) that can be easily [...] "counted".|$|E

Overlaying the syn-rift sediments are 200 meters of Pliocene to Pleistocene hemipelagic marine sediment with intermittent volcanic glass. This sediment layer is believed to be deposited after the end of rifting due to its subhorizontal seismic reflection profile.|$|E
