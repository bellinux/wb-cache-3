In the ideological stylistics of the new <b>regime</b> <b>terrorism</b> was understood mainly as acts of industrial sabotage and ideological subversion by small groups organized and infiltrated by the countries of the capitalist world - the Socialist Bloc's main adversary during the Cold War. As such the main counter-terror force of the People's Republic of Bulgaria were the Interior Troops of the Ministry of the Interior. They were organized {{along the lines of the}} Soviet Union's Interior Troops as a light infantry military force.

However, Libya has a deep hand in terrorism dating back to when Colonel Muammar Qaddafi took control of the country in 1969. During the years that Qaddafi was in control, he financially backed terrorist organizations, who repeatedly aimed their sights on the United States and their allies. Even after the fall of Qaddafi’s <b>regime,</b> <b>terrorism</b> is still a part of the governmental strategy in the country. The attack in Benghazi against an American compound, which resulted in 4 American deaths shows that terrorism is alive and well within Libya.

40|$|This book {{engages the}} intense {{relationship}} between citizenship {{and security in}} modern politics. It focuses on questions of citizenship in security analysis in order to critically evaluate how political being is and can be constituted in relation to securitising practices. In light of contemporary issues and events such as human rights <b>regimes,</b> <b>terrorism,</b> identity control, commercialisation of security, diaspora, and border policies, this book addresses a citizenship deficit in security studies. The chapters introduce several key political themes that characterise the interplays between citizenship and security: changes in citizenship regimes, the renewed insecurity of citizenship-state relations, the emerging ways by which the political and national communities are crafted, and the ways democratic societies and regimes react in times of insecurity. Approaching citizenship as both a governmental practice and a resource of political contestation, the book aims to highlight what political challenges and contestations are created in situations where security intensely meets citizenship today. This book will {{be of interest to}} scholars of security studies and security politics, citizenship studies, and international relation...|$|R

These measures comprise five categories of activity: (1) increased personnel for security agencies and efficiency-enhancing reforms within these agencies; (2) a significant increase in and upgrading of equipment for security agencies; (3) the strengthening of the legal foundation (laws, regulations) for combating these offences with judicial measures; (4) an increase in bilateral, regional and international cooperation in the field of security; and (5) the implementation of preventive measures.

40|$|In {{order to}} analyze the {{potential}} of a relationship between terrorist groups and state violence, this paper analyzes two case studies from Latin America - that of Sendero Luminoso, in Peru, and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (the FARC), in Colombia – and two cases from the Middle East and North Africa – that of al-Jama’a al-Islamiyya in Egypt and Muqtada al-Sadr’s Mehdi Army in Iraq. After {{a review of the}} cases and general literature on <b>regime</b> violence and <b>terrorism</b> around the world, this paper proposes a likely correlation between an increase in state violence and an escalation in the use of terrorism.

40|$|Terrorism {{has become}} a major preoccupation of governments in western countries, {{including}} Australia, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand. This preoccupation has often manifested itself in frenetic legislative activity. In 2002, amidst some public controversy, the Australian parliament passed a raft of legislation aimed at enhancing Australia's protection against the possibility of terrorist threat (Williams 2003; Carne 2003; Ricketts 2002; Head 2002; Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee 2002). A major plank of such legislation was the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Act 2002. Research into this legislation and its effects, however, remains very undeveloped. More generally, there is limited academic literature on combating the financing of terrorism (see, however, Levitt 2003; Sheppard 2002; Bantekas 2003; Selden 2003; Myers 2002; Chenumolu 2003; Hardister 2003; Pieth 2003). The scholarship to date tends to be focused on the legal and regulatory aspects of the legislation rather than its social and political implications in terms of civil rights and democracy (see Tan 2003).

This conflict is further highlighted by the nature of the topic at hand: money laundering and financing of terrorism, which have seen significant growth due to globalization. It also analyzes how the U. S. money laundering laws have impacted international anti-money laundering laws and ultimately similar laws and policies in Lebanon. It examines how the latest efforts to develop efficient strategies for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism has led to the establishment of financial intelligence units combining several diverse but unified aspects of financial systems and law enforcement. This research also provides a summarized account of Lebanon’s anti-money laundering and combating the financing of <b>terrorism</b> <b>regime.</b> Through policy and discourse analysis, it explores the behavior of the Lebanese financial system in crises showing how the Central Bank’s timely intervention in problematic situations has resulted in leveling international and domestic political pressures. The main question is: How has Lebanon sustained its leading role as one of the most important financial and banking centers in the Middle East based on its longstanding banking secrecy practices as well as complied with international standards regarding anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism; it is hoped that this thesis provides an informative and plausible answer.

5000|$|Diaz-Paniagua {{has noted}} that, {{in order to}} [...] "create an {{effective}} legal <b>regime</b> against <b>terrorism,</b> {{it would be necessary}} to formulate a comprehensive definition of that crime that, on the one hand, provides the strongest moral condemnation to terrorist activities while, on the other hand, has enough precision to permit the prosecution of criminal activities without condemning acts that should be deemed to be legitimate. [...] Nonetheless, due to major divergences at the international level {{on the question of the}} legitimacy of the use of violence for political purposes, either by states or by self-determination and revolutionary groups, this has not yet been possible." [...] In this sense, M. Cherif Bassiouni notes: to define 'terrorism' in a way that is both all-inclusive and unambiguous is very difficult, if not impossible. One of the principal difficulties lies in the fundamental values at stake in the acceptance or rejection of terror-inspiring violence as means of accomplishing a given goal. The obvious and well known range of views on these issues are what makes an internationally accepted specific definition of what is loosely called 'terrorism,' a largely impossible undertaking. That is why the search for and internationally agreed upon definition may well be a futile and unnecessary effort. Sami Zeidan, a Lebanese diplomat and scholar, explained the political reasons underlying the current difficulties to define terrorism as follows: There is no general consensus on the definition of terrorism. The difficulty of defining terrorism lies in the risk it entails of taking positions. The political value of the term currently prevails over its legal one. Left to its political meaning, terrorism easily falls prey to change that suits the interests of particular states at particular times. The Taliban and Osama bin Laden were once called freedom fighters (mujahideen) and backed by the CIA when they were resisting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Now they are on top of the international terrorist lists. Today, the United Nations views Palestinians as freedom fighters, struggling against the unlawful occupation of their land by Israel, and engaged in a long-established legitimate resistance, yet Israel regards them as terrorists. Israel also brands the Hizbullah of Lebanon as a terrorist group, whereas most of the international community regards it as a legitimate resistance group, fighting Israel's occupation of Southern Lebanon. In fact, the successful ousting of Israeli forces from most of the South by the Hizbollah in 2000 made Lebanon the only Arab country to actually defeat the Israeli army. The repercussion of the current preponderance of the political over the legal value of terrorism is costly, leaving the war against terrorism selective, incomplete and ineffective.|$|R
40|$|The ranging {{course of}} {{terrorism}} banishing {{peace and security}} prospects of today’s Pakistan {{is seen as a}} domestic effluent of its own flawed policies, bad governance, and lack of social justice and rule of law in society and widening gulf of trust between the rulers and the ruled. The study focused on policies and performance of the Musharraf government since assuming the mantle of front ranking ally of the United States in its so called ‘war on terror’. The causes of reversal of pre nine-eleven position on Afghanistan and support of its Taliban’s rulers are examined {{in the light of the}} geo-strategic compulsions of that crucial time and the structural weakness of military rule that needed external props for legitimacy. The flaws of the response to the terrorist challenges are traced to its total dependence on the hard option to the total neglect of the human factor from which the thesis develops its argument for a holistic approach to security in which the people occupy a central position. Thesis approach is also shown to hold the solutions for eliminating the causes of extremism on which terrorism feeds and grows. In sum the study deconstructs Musharraf’s <b>regime’s</b> response to <b>terrorism</b> by examining the conceptual mould of the strategic players in the country and postulates a holistic and integrated security framework to deal with terrorism on a pro-active and sustainable basis. An approach such as this would logically entail the redefining of the role of the state vis-à-vis its people as the fulcrum and medium of ensuring traditional and non traditional security of the country.

2500|$|The {{fake news}} report, which heavily {{utilised}} footage from the 2008 war in South Ossetia, began by Imedi accusing the Georgian {{opposition of the}} organisation of protests in Tbilisi due to alleged fraud in the Tbilisi city elections which were scheduled for 30 May. During the protests, unknown gunmen opened fire on the protestors, killing some. As a result, the opposition pleaded {{for the international community}} to assist in ousting the [...] "Saakashvili tyranny". Following the protest in Tbilisi, an ambush in the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali occurred, which killed the President of South Ossetia Eduard Kokoity. Moscow announced that it held proof of the involvement of Georgian security services in the Kokoity assassination, which Russia deemed to be a terrorist attack. Allegedly pro-Russian opposition politicians, led by Nino Burdzhanadze and Zurab Nogaideli travelled to Tskhinval and accused Saakashvili of the killing of Kokoity. After the assassination, Russian Army troops were mobilized and put on high alert. Georgian Army troops were mobilized, and took defensive positions around Tbilisi with heavy artillery. A people's government with Burdzhanadze at the helm declared the government of Saakashvili [...] "illegal". Other Georgian opposition politicians who were held up as collaborators with the Russians included Zurab Dzidziguri, Kakha Kukava, Koba Davitashvili, Levan Gachechiladze and Giorgi Khaindrava. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev is shown, with a Georgian voiceover, allegedly saying “Since the Saakashvili <b>regime</b> began open <b>terrorism</b> against South Ossetia, this international criminal must be stopped. I have ordered a military operation, and call on the Georgian people not to resist the troops that bring them freedom.” [...] The broadcast then showed Russian tanks, which were based in the Akhalgori region in South Ossetia, entering the Georgian capital, and several Georgian battalions were reported to have defected and sided with the people's government. Saakashvili is pronounced as having possibly been assassinated, which was allegedly announced by the Movement for Fair Georgia; the political party headed by former Georgian Prime Minister and current opposition politician, Zurab Nogaideli. However, other reports had stated that Saakashvili was alive in a hidden location and still in command. The broadcast stated that the West stood by and issued only [...] "halfhearted protests". A speech said to have been given by President Saakashvili is shown, where he stated that Russia wanted to become an Empire, and instructed all eligible Georgians to join the military. Meanwhile, Russian planes are reported to have bombed targets all over Georgia, and Georgian volunteers are reported to be engaged in combat in Mtskheta. The report also included the scenario of the aircraft carrying Polish President Lech Kaczyński to Tbilisi being blown up, leading to the Polish President's death.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 87 - 92). Globalization {{and terrorism}} are key issues in today's international affairs. Interdependence {{used to be}} among major powers and their respective colonies. The world continues to remain interdependent, yet, in a different form. Indeed, international relations almost always involve violence and war, nevertheless, they are also centered on economic interests and trade. Wars would {{most of the time}} have territorial purposes. Today, the United States is leading a war against trans-national terrorism, a phenomenon that has evolved throughout globalization, particularly with the advancement of technology and its relatively simple access. September 11 bluntly illustrated the use of a global means, the airplane, and a plot accurately masterminded {{in different parts of the}} world. Terrorism, in addition, acquired different aspects. In the past, it would be addressed against specific statesmen, related to a defined political cause. More recently, it remained a method with political objectives. Yet, it now targets innocent civilians, little involved in state policies. Nevertheless, in the eyes of the trans-national terrorists, no one is innocent. On the contrary, every person actually symbolizes the policies of the targeted state. Furthermore, the United States decided to launch a global war, a battle usually involving states, rather non-state actors. Such a position greatly affected the United States' relations with its allies, namely the European countries. The latter indeed have similar objectives in preventing and countering trans-national terrorism, particularly after having been subject to large-scale terrorist attacks at home. Yet, as opposed to American unilateralism, most European countries united in a multilateral perspective, strengthening intelligence and police measures among one another. In addition to the military approach, the United States left no choice to the other countries, which would either be with the United States, or automatically with the enemy. As a matter of fact, the source of transnational terrorism has increasingly been located in the Middle East. In the American view, the Middle East mostly hosts repressive, authoritarian, Islamic anti-American <b>regimes</b> which breed <b>terrorism</b> as a means of expression and which therefore ought to be replaced by democratic systems. The United States aims at doing so militarily. In the European view, the large immigrant population at home is composed of those who had fled countries either in conflict, or undergoing harsh political and economic crises. Following September 11, the Madrid and London attacks, immigrants with Muslim and Arab origins increasingly became associated with terrorism. As a result, Europe aimed at regulating and controlling migration, yet, with respect to human rights and refugees asylum. It therefore carefully analyzed the reason of migration and aims at promoting development in the immigrants' respective countries of Origin. As such, Europe witnessed internal divisions with regard to foreign policy vis-a-vis the United States on the one hand, and global terrorism on the other. The United Kingdom was the first to join the United States on such an initiative, while other European countries opted for policies established within a multilateral framework. This thesis brings together two different perspectives on a common inescapable reality. Both the American and European sides are aware that tans-national terrorism is implanted worldwide threatening virtually, yet, with very concrete consequences on the international order. 1 bound copy: 92 leaves; 30 cm. available at RNL...|$|R

40|$|In this Master's Thesis I am {{examining}} the nuclear non-proliferation as a regime. Nuclear non-proliferation is mainly {{discussed in the}} framework of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). After the terrorist attacks in USA in September 2001 nuclear terrorism {{has become one of the}} major concerns in the international relations. In this thesis nuclear terrorism is studied {{in the framework of}} nuclear non-proliferation and the power structure created by the NPT. The starting point for this study is the assumption that the power structure created by the NPT affects the argumentation on the suppression of the acts of nuclear terrorism. The NPT allows only five states to acquire and possess nuclear weapons. It creates an unbalanced system of states based on the ownership of nuclear weapons. This system is studied as a <b>regime.</b> Nuclear <b>terrorism</b> is considered strictly connected to the further proliferation of nuclear materials and weapons. My assumption is that this attempt to create a convention suppressing nuclear terrorism is just a way for the nuclear weapon states to maintain and continue the non-proliferation regime and the power structure created by it. My research stands mainly somewhere between the structuralist and realist views of IR. International regime theories form the theoretical basis for this study. I am concentrating on representing two approaches of regime theories, the structuralist and the cognitivist approaches and especially the thinking of Robert Keohane and Ernst B. Haas. The non-proliferation regime is studied through Keohane’s theory of hegemonic stability and by using the central concept of knowledge from Haas’s thinking. The research method used in this Thesis is rhetoric. I chose to use new rhetoric and especially the argumentation theories of Chaïm Perelman and Stephen Toulmin. I use their theories of argumentation in analysis of the arguments of the United Nations Ad Hoc Committee on Terrorism. Argumentation is based on the states views of the Draft Convention on the Suppression of the Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. This research shows that the international power structure created by the NPT could still be found in the arguments of the Ad Hoc Committee. The NWS do not seem to be giving up their rights to be the only legitimate possessors and users of nuclear weapons. Nowadays globalized world has brought along new possibilities to proliferate nuclear weapons; even the non-state actors may acquire nuclear weapons. Five nuclear weapon states cannot maintain their power political status anymore through the traditional non-proliferation regime. They need to find new ways to legitimize and justify the limited possession of nuclear arsenals and their use. The international power system cannot be equal or efficient in trying to fight nuclear terrorism if it is based on the ownership of nuclear weapons and on the structures created by the non-proliferation regime. Recent developments seem to be turning the international system towards the situation where the powerful state is only trying to secure its own interests and maintain its power status. 1.
