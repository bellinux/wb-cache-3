The data indicates great variation {{in the ways that}} LAs talked about student ideas across the semesters. For Spring 2014, Fall 2015, and Spring 2016, over half of the student ideas were talked about using <b>resource</b> <b>language.</b> In fact, on average across all semesters, 55 % of student ideas responses used <b>resource</b> <b>language.</b> Note that a 55 % average of resources coded within responses already coded as student ideas actually amounts to only 9 % of total LA responses. In Fall 2014, however, obstacle language was more dominant, and in Spring 2015, there was a fairly even distribution between all three subcodes. If we define “deep” learning to mean obstacle or <b>resource</b> <b>language</b> (i.e., referring to student ideas in a more than superficial way), we see that over 60 % of LA responses that discussed student ideas demonstrated deep learning.|$|E

This paper concentrates on automatic normalization of Punjabi words. Punjabi is the official language for state of Punjab. But Punjabi is under <b>resource</b> <b>language.</b> There are very less number of computational-linguistic resources available for Punjabi.

Research suggests that proactive engagement strategies and interventions can have a greater effect on overall classroom behaviors than negative consequences. A single case experiment measured the effects of expository advance organizers on academically engaged behavior, respectful behavior, and disruptive behavior in the special education self-contained resource classroom. The single-case A-B-A-B design for this study evaluates these components of student engagement during academic instruction over a four-week period.

40|$|Abstract. Clinicians have to {{deal with}} large amounts of textual data, searching for and {{navigating}} information that satisfies their informational needs. Clinical notes and Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) are textual resources that usually contain free text. As language use in the medical domain is rather specialized, generic information retrieval tools are suboptimal for such data. This calls for specialized information retrieval systems that incorporate domain-specific knowledge. Furthermore, information resources for relatively small languages are limited, so physicians speaking those languages often have to resort to in-formation sources in English or one of the other major languages spoken. In our setting, given a patient record written in Norwegian, a physician is looking for recommendations in CPGs written in English. The recommendations are to be retrieved and ranked according to their relevance to (specified parts of) the pa-tient’s medical history and possibly a user-supplied query. This means that the query language and the <b>resource</b> <b>language</b> differ, requiring some form of Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval. Most approaches rely on translating the inpu...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose to}} use sparse inverse {{covariance}} matrices for acoustic model training {{when there is}} insufficient training data. Acoustic models trained with inadequate training data tend to over fit, generalizing poorly to unseen test data, especially when full covariance matrices are used. We address this problem by adding an L 1 regularization term to the traditional objective function for maximum likelihood estimation, to penalize complex models. The structure of the inverse covariance matrices will be automatically sparsified using this new objective function. The Expectation Maximization algorithm is used to learn {{the parameters of the}} hidden Markov model using the new objective function. It is shown that the training procedures for all the hidden Markov model parameters are {{the same as that of}} maximum likelihood estimation except the inverse covariance matrices. The update equation for the inverse covariance matrices is concave and can be solved efficiently. Our experiments show that this proposed method can correctly learn the underlying correlations among the random variables of the speech feature vector. Experimental results on the Wall Street Journal data show that our proposed model significantly outperforms the diagonal covariance model and the full covariance model by 10. 9 % and 16. 5 % relative recognition accuracy, when only about 14 hours of training data are available. On our collected low <b>resource</b> <b>language</b> data-the Cantonese data set, the proposed model also significantly outperforms the diagonal covariance model and the full covariance model. © 2006 - 2012 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{crystallized}} measures of intelligence are highly susceptible to educational, <b>resource,</b> <b>language</b> and socio-economic influences, and that the implications of using these kinds of measures are manifold affecting school and university entrance as well as employment opportunities. In South Africa, wherein tests are regarded with suspicion as a consequence of test misuse during the Apartheid era, there is an urgent need for the development of measures which are resilient to these influences. In answer to this, working memory measures have been identified as possible measures which minimize these biases. Consequently the following study investigated whether working memory tests were less susceptible to socioeconomic influences than the more traditional, crystallized measures of vocabulary and non-verbal IQ in a volunteer sample of 60 grade one learners from schools identified as high and low in socioeconomic status. The results demonstrated that working memory measures were consistently less affected by socio-economic status as compared to the traditional vocabulary and non-verbal IQ measures. However, socioeconomic status and language were found to be so closely correlated that {{it is not clear whether}} test performance in the vocabulary measures, was related one or both of these variables. In light of the fact that this study was correlational in nature, it is recommended that future studies focus on limiting the impact of extraneous variables to better understand the impact of socioeconomic status on test performance. Furthermore future studies should test children in their home language to avoid language contamination effects...|$|E

Applications of STD include speech data indexing, voice dialling, {{telephone}} monitoring and data mining. Performance of STD depends mainly on representation of speech signal and matching of represented signal. This work investigates methods for robust representation of speech signal, which is invariant to speaker variability, {{in the context of}} STD task. Here the representation {{is in the form of}} templates, a sequence of feature vectors. Typical representation in speech community Mel-Frequency CepstralCoe cients (MFCC) carry both speech-specific and speaker-specific information, so the need for better representation. Searching is done by matching sequence of feature vectors of query and reference utterances by using Subsequence Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). The performance of the proposed representation is evaluated on Telugu broadcast news data. In the absence of labelled data i. e., in unsupervised setting, we propose to capture joint density of acoustic space spanned by MFCCs using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Gaussian-Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machines (GBRBM).
