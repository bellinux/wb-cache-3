40|$|Four {{groups of}} six 28 -day-old piglets (three male, three female) were {{assigned}} to each of four floors, bedded concrete, bare concrete, perforated <b>metal</b> or <b>raised</b> rubber-coated <b>metal.</b> Each pen was equipped with a microswitch which, when pushed, turned on three 250 -W infrared lamps suspended 42 cm above the floor. Each group of piglets remained on each floor for 48 h and the same groups were used for a second replicate. This approach was repeated with different groups of piglets at temperatures of 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 and 24 degrees C. Behaviour regarding activation of the microswitch was monitored {{by the use of}} a video cassette recorder. Light at 180 lux was provided continuously. On bedded concrete, piglets demanded approximately 3 min less heat per hour than on any other floor and on perforated metal demanded approximately 3 min more heat per hour than on any other floor. Supplemental heat on bare concrete was similar to that of <b>raised</b> rubber-coated <b>metal.</b> From the results it was established that the effective environmental temperature on bedded concrete is 3 degrees C warmer than that for bare concrete or <b>raised</b> rubber-coated <b>metal</b> and 6 degrees C warmer than perforated metal.

50|$|Charge in the {{universe}} is conserved. The electrophorus simply separates positive and negative charges. A positive or negative charge ends up on the metal plate (or other storage conductor), and the opposite charge is stored in another object after grounding (in the earth or the person touching the metal plate). This separation takes work since the lowest energy state implies uncharged objects. Work is done by <b>raising</b> the charged <b>metal</b> plate away from the oppositely charged resinous plate. This additional energy put into the system is converted to potential {{energy in the form}} of charge separation (opposite charges that were originally on the plate), so <b>raising</b> the <b>metal</b> plate actually increases its voltage relative to the dielectic plate.|$|R

5000|$|The 2005 {{model year}} Legacy for the US market was offered in 2.5i, 2.5i Limited, 2.5GT, and 2.5GT Limited. All trim levels were {{available}} as Sedan and Wagon. The wagon body shared the roof sheet metal with the Outback model that had <b>raised</b> <b>metal</b> [...] "humps" [...] under the roof rails, unlike the Japanese and European wagons {{that had a}} sleeker roof. Another difference from other overseas markets, was that both sedan and wagon had longer front and rear bumpers, {{designed to meet the}} Canadian 5-mph bumper specification. For 2006, the regular GT was dropped, and the 2.5i Special Edition was added into the line up. Manual transmission is also discontinued in station wagon body. Priced between the base and the Limited models, the 2.5i Special Edition came with power moonroof and power driver seat, while the 2.5i Limited also came with leather interior, power front passenger seat, and climate control automatic air condition.|$|E
5000|$|A {{standard}} Pump it Up arcade machine {{consists of}} two parts, the cabinet and the dance platform. The cabinet has a wide bottom section, which houses large floor speakers and glowing neon lamps. Above this sits a narrower section that contains the monitor, and on top is a lighted marquee graphic, with two small speakers and flashing lights on it. The dance stage is a <b>raised</b> <b>metal</b> platform divided into two sides. Each side houses a set of five acrylic glass pads arranged like the pips on the 5 side of a die, separated by metal squares. Each pad sits atop pressure activated switches, and a software-controlled cold cathode lamp illuminating the translucent pad. A metal safety bar {{in the shape of}} an [...] "R" [...] is mounted to the dance stage behind each player. Some players make use of this safety bar to help maintain proper balance, do tricks during Freestyle routines, and to relieve weight from the legs so that arrows can be pressed with greater speed and accuracy. The community however, places more emphasis on no-bar play, as most major Pump it Up tournaments do not allow bar usage or have a separate division allowing it.|$|E

5000|$|Typically {{the head}} {{will be made}} of steel and the handle of wood. Light weight {{titanium}} heads with longer handles allow for increased velocity, resulting in greater energy delivery, while decreasing arm fatigue and risk of carpal tunnel syndrome [...] The milled face of the head consists of a waffle-like grid of small four sided pyramids. Nails typically used for framing have a grid of intersecting <b>raised</b> <b>metal</b> lines {{on the head of}} the nail. The raised marks on the head of the hammer grip this grid, which helps to prevent the hammer from sliding off the nail head when striking a nail. Since the frame typically will not be seen on the finished house, the inevitable marring of wood surfaces by the milled hammer face is not an issue. A hammer with a smooth striking surface is known as a finishing hammer and is used where marring of the wood is to be avoided for cosmetic reasons. Some framing hammers have a magnetized slot along the top edge of the striking surface to hold a nail. This allows the nail to be placed and driven quickly with just one hand.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{the weaver}} has made their circuit {{of the front}} of the machines, they will then circle around to the back. At this point they will gently stroke their hand over the <b>raised</b> <b>metal</b> [...] "tells" [...] {{on the back of the}} machine. These tells, located over a special metal circuit, are held up by the tension of the thread coming from the warp. Should the warp thread be broken, the tells will drop and cause the machine to stop working. However, it is {{possible}} for them to become stuck in the upward position, and by doing so create problems in the weaving. By gently touching the tells, then, it is possible for the weaver to find tells which have become stuck in the up position, and correct the error. As with pick breaks, the weavers are trained to keep the machines running as much as possible; with speedy knot tying and correction being stressed. In this situation, they are expected to take less than a minute, with the mean ideal being ten to thirty seconds, to correct a break. The weaver also watches for warps that are about to run out, or problems in the warp itself which were not detected in the slashing process. Typically, weavers can expect to make several dozen circuits of their machines a night, with most of their time spent ensuring the quality of the cloth and the company standards of production.|$|E
50|$|For the 1996 model year, the Grand Cherokee {{received}} a minor restyling {{to keep up}} with competitors such as the Ford Explorer and the Toyota 4Runner, both of which had been improved. The Grand Cherokee featured new front and rear bumpers, dual front SRS airbags, upgraded seatbelt safety devices, steering wheel-mounted sound system controls for some models, and revised steering wheel, now three-spoke with integrated cruise control buttons, a new dual-note horn, and the horn buttons were deleted in favor of a single horn pad which allowed the driver to press anywhere {{in the center of the}} steering wheel to sound the vehicle's horn. It was also given upgraded seats, an upgraded interior with new door panels and interior trim panels, a glove box that had more storage space, new tires and wheels, revised headlamps, fog lamps that were directly integrated into the vehicle's front bumper on some models, a new keyless entry remote, and faux wood interior trim standard on all models. An optional rear lift glass (first introduced with the 1995 Orvis edition where production tailgates manufactured after January 3, 1995 have both provisions for both fixed and lift glass) for the Laredo and Limited were added to the options list (the fixed glass came standard). The base SE model was dropped for 1996, in favor of new features being added to the Laredo (now base) model. The Grand Cherokee now offered standard power windows, power door locks, rear door child locks, cool blasting, keyless entry, A/M-F/M radio with cassette player and compact disc player and four standard speakers, cloth seating surfaces, and more. The manual transmission was no longer offered after the 1994 model year Grand Cherokee sold in North America but remained as the base transmission for European ZJs (ZG) sold in Europe with the diesel motor. New front door designs got new side body cladding strips, and the 'Laredo' subtext on the Laredo model was moved down to the cladding. The 'Grand Cherokee' badge was relocated to the front lower doors, and was now larger (using a font style similar to other Chrysler products), replacing the 1974-era American Motors font style used on Jeep vehicles. On V8-equipped Grand Cherokees, there was a new V8 badge on the rear liftgate. The 4X4 badge, on four-wheel-drive-equipped Grand Cherokees, was also changed to <b>raised</b> <b>metal</b> letters instead of the 4X4 decals offered before. A combination cassette player and CD player was available for the first time as an option, and the vehicle featured an OBD II diagnostics port under the dashboard on the driver's side, required for all 1996 model year and newer vehicles, a digital odometer and trip odometer, a 120 miles per hour speedometer rating on some models, and the vehicle now included some user-programmable features such as if the headlamps and tail lamps flashed when a button was pressed on the keyless entry remote, how many miles until service intervals, whether the horn sounded when a button was pressed on the keyless entry remote, and more. The overhead console was somewhat redesigned for the 1996 model year to improve storage space and feature availability. In addition to the cigarette lighter port, a 12-volt power port was added for cellular telephones, coolers, computers, and other devices. The ashtray was also removed from the rear doors, replaced by a solid area. The Limited model and Orvis Edition model both got chrome interior door handles.|$|E
