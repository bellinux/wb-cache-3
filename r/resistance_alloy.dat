To quantify the redistribution, we have used electron backscatter diffraction and energy dispersive spectroscopy to analyze the microstructure of 617 after creep testing at 900 and 1000 °C. The data were analyzed with respect to location of the carbides (e. g., intergranular vs. intragranular), grain boundary character, and precipitate type (i. e., Cr-rich or Mo-rich). We find that grain boundary character is {{the most important factor in}} carbide distribution; some evidence of preferential distribution to boundaries in tension is also observed at higher applied stresses. Finally, the results suggest that the observed redistribution is due to the migration of carbides to the boundaries and not the migration of boundaries to the precipitates...|$|E

There are methods to prevent the wear by surface coating that is one, by heat treatment and another by hardfacing by welding. In heat treatment {{it is not possible}} to deposit the coatings on the base metal to maximum thickness. This is possible by hardfacing using welding process. The abrasive wear characteristics of different hardfacing electrodes deposited on Mild steel (M. S) plate was studied using the dry sand rubber wheel abrasion tester. The results illustrates that different hardfacing electrodes as well as the weld procedures variation using the variation of chromium, silicon, and carbon have large effects on the abrasion resistance are mainly attributed to the variation in deposit chemistry and microstructures. Carbon and chromium content is an important factor in determining microstructure of such hardfacing electrodes and therefore abrasive wear resistance.

40|$|Abstract Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{supplement}} the scant previous investigations on the corrosion behaviour of 2205 and 2507 duplex stainless steels in selected organic acids containing chloride additions. Design/methodology/approach – Microstructural examination of the alloys was first carried out, after which the corrosion behaviour of the alloys in citric, oxalic, formic and acetic acids containing chloride additions at varying temperatures was studied using electrochemical techniques. Findings – The alloy 2507 material had a larger grain size than did the alloy 2205 sample. The corrosion resistances of the alloys generally are highest in acetic acids and lowest in citric acid. The addition of chloride had a pronounced effect on their corrosion <b>resistance.</b> <b>Alloy</b> 2507 generally exhibited higher corrosion resistance in all of the acids than alloy 2205, with the exception of acetic acid at room temperature. The 50 : 50 ratio of ferrite to austenite composition, as revealed by phase compositional analysis, indicated no significant possibility for galvanic corrosion between the phases. This suggests that the corrosion behaviour of the alloys is controlled by their grain sizes and chemical compositions. Originality/value – Although the corrosion behaviour of duplex stainless steels in some organic acid media has been reported, this investigation covers the major organic acids not previously reported. Since in real industrial systems a mixture of both organic and minerals acids/salts may typically exist, investigations of the combined effect of chloride ions with the organic acids reported in this paper typify real industrial operations. The paper thus provides a basis for material selection for the application of 2205 and 2507 in industrial systems where organic acids are mostly used...|$|E

The strength of the low-Sn Zr alloy with a higher Nb content (x = 1. 2 wt %) is enhanced up to 499 MPa, comparable to that of the reference high-Sn N 36 alloy (Zr- 1. 0 Sn- 1. 0 Nb- 0. 25 Fe, wt %). Although the strength improvement is at a slight expense of corrosion resistance with the increase of Nb, the corrosion resistance of the high-Nb alloy with x = 1. 2 (ΔG = 90. 4 mg/dm 2 for 100 -day exposure in the water steam) is still better than that of N 36 (ΔG = 103. 4 mg/dm 2) ...|$|E
40|$|High Chromium White Irons (HCWI) {{hardfacing}} alloys {{are used}} {{extensively in the}} mining and other processing industries. Hardfacing alloys are mainly meant for combating the wear of components and structures. However, these alloys are also used under conditions that involve corrosive fluids and only limited studies {{are available on the}} corrosion behaviour of these alloys. The hardfacing alloys are mainly based on carbides. The most popular abrasion <b>resistance</b> <b>alloy</b> is based on chromium carbides. In the first stage of the thesis, Pourbaix diagrams developed for chromium carbides and other strong carbide forming elements such as titanium, niobium and tungsten at 298 K using thermodynamic data of the stable species, equilibrium reduction reactions and thermodynamic calculations. The Pourbaix diagrams were useful in predicting and explaining the corrosion behavior of the hardfacing alloys. In addition, experiments were designed in the regions of interest such as a combination of pH and potential. In the second stage of this research, experimental work was carried out to investigate the corrosion behaviour of welded HCWI hardfacing alloys with strong carbide forming elements in acidic, alkaline and neutral environments. The HCWI selected are as described in the Australian Standards AS 2576, which is probably the most advanced standard in the world as it defines not only the hardness but also its microstructures. The HCWI microstructure consists of primary and eutectic carbides and eutectic austenitic/martensitic matrix. The potentiodynamic and potentiostatic tests were used to study the corrosion behaviour of HCWI in all the three environments. In alkaline pH 14 and neutral pH 7 buffer solutions, corrosion of HCWI occurs at carbides in preference to eutectic austenite matrix. In acidic pH 1. 5 and neutral pH 7 NaCl solutions, corrosion of HCWI occurs at eutectic martensitic matrix in preference to carbides. Whereas, in acidic solution of pH 2, the corrosion occurs at eutectic carbides in preference to eutectic austenite matrix. From these experimental results, the corrosion trend of HCWI in acidic, alkaline and neutral environments was studied using the superimposed Pourbaix diagram of carbides. From the study of superimposed Pourbaix diagrams of carbides found that in all the three environments, corrosion of eutectic austenite/martensitic matrix or carbides depended upon the formation of passive film on the surface of eutectic austenite/martensite. The corrosion of eutectic martensitic matrix in neutral pH 7 NaCl solution is mainly due to removal of passive layer by the aggressive chloride ions in the solution. The Pourbaix diagram of chromium carbides revealed that stability of Cr 23 C 6 eutectic carbides were found to be less stable than the Cr 7 C 3 primary carbides. The superimposed Pourbaix diagrams of carbides and hardness tests also showed that dissociation of carbides reduces the wear resistance of HCWI hardfacing alloys significantly. The results of this work provide significant contribution in designing better corrosion resistant HCWI hardfacing alloys for wear resistance applications...|$|E

The total creep contraction of the alloys {{was found to}} be well correlated using an empirical equation. On the basis of this equation, a parametrical relationship was derived which allowed the total creep contraction {{to be related to the}} applied stress, the temperature and the time of test, so that a quantitative assessment of compressive creep of the alloys could be made under different testing conditions. The primary creep and secondary creep rates were found for the alloys at different temperatures and stresses. Generally, the primary creep contraction was found to increase with copper content, whereas secondary creep rates decreased in the order No 3, ACuZinc 10, ACuZinc 5 and No 2. ILZRO. 16 was tested only at the highest stress and two higher temperatures. The results showed that ILZRO. 16 had higher creep resistance than all the other alloys. Thus, based on the above empirical equation, alloy No 2 was found to have a substantially better total creep <b>resistance</b> than <b>alloys</b> No 3 and No 5, and slightly better than ACuZinc 5 and ACuZinc 10 for strains up to 1 %. Both ACuZinc alloys had higher creep strength than commercial alloys No 3 and No 5. Alloy No 5 had much higher creep <b>resistance</b> than <b>alloy</b> No 3 under all conditions. The superior creep <b>resistance</b> of <b>alloy</b> No 2 was considered to be due to the presence of small precipitates of -phase in the zinc matrix and a regular eutectic morphology.

The lower creep <b>resistance</b> of <b>alloy</b> No 3 was mainly due to the lower creep strength of copper-free primary particles having greater volume than eutectic in the microstructure.
