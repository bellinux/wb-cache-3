5|$|During {{its annual}} session in 2000, the WMO/ESCAP Panel on North Indian Tropical Cyclones agreed in {{principle}} to start assigning names to cyclonic storms that developed within the North Indian Ocean. As a result of this, the panel requested that each member country submit a list of ten names to a <b>rapporteur</b> {{by the end of}} 2000. At the 2001 session, the <b>rapporteur</b> reported that of the eight countries involved, only India had refused to submit a list of names, as it had some reservations about assigning names to tropical cyclones. The panel then studied the names and felt that some of the names would not be appealing to the public or the media and thus requested that members submit new lists of names. During 2002 the <b>rapporteur</b> reported {{that there had been a}} poor response by member countries in resubmitting their lists of names. Over the next year, each country except India submitted a fresh list. By the 2004 session, India had still not submitted its list despite promising to do so. However, the <b>rapporteur</b> presented the lists of names that would be used with a gap left for India's names. The <b>rapporteur</b> also recommended that the naming lists be used on an experimental basis during the season, starting in May or June 2004. The naming lists were then completed in May 2004, after India submitted their names. However, the lists were not used until September 2004, when the first tropical cyclone was named Onil by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).|$|E
5|$|On November 8, 1991, Angelo Vidal d'Almeida Ribeiro, the Special <b>Rapporteur</b> for the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, filed {{a request}} to the U.S. Government based on a {{complaint}} that had been filed concerning the LaRouche case. The U.S. government responded by saying that LaRouche had been given due process under {{the laws of the}} United States. The U.N. Commission took no further action.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. State {{department}} {{considers that}} “discrimination against women {{is a significant}} problem” in Saudi Arabia and that women have few political or social rights. After her 2008 visit, the UN special <b>rapporteur</b> on violence against women noted the lack of women's autonomy {{and the absence of}} a law criminalizing violence against women. The World Economic Forum 2012 Global Gender Gap Report ranked Saudi Arabia 131st out of 135 countries for gender parity, ahead of Syria, Chad, Pakistan and Yemen.|$|E
50|$|Other controversies {{between the}} Special <b>Rapporteurs</b> and the Council include the {{introduction}} of a code of conduct which initially disallowed the Special <b>Rapporteurs</b> from addressing the media. However a compromise was reached and a code of conduct now exists for the Special <b>Rapporteurs.</b>|$|R
50|$|In June 2006, the United Nations Human Rights Council, which {{replaced}} the UN Commission on Human Rights, extended the mandates of all Special <b>Rapporteurs</b> by {{one year to}} enable it to conduct {{a review of the}} mandates and seek ways of strengthening their roles. However, Special <b>Rapporteurs</b> for countries which did not approve a Special <b>Rapporteurs</b> came under question and the mandates of the Special <b>Rapporteurs</b> for Cuba and Belarus were not renewed.|$|R

5|$|Prince Sadruddin had, since 1978, been variously: Special Consultant and Chargé de Mission to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Special <b>Rapporteur</b> of the UN Human Rights Commission and Convenor and Co-Chairman of the Independent Commission on International Humanitarian Issues {{and of the}} Independent Working Group on the UN Financial Emergency. He {{was later}} Coordinator for United Nations Humanitarian and Economic Assistance Programmes Relating to the People of Afghanistan and Executive Delegate of the Secretary-General for a United Nations Inter-Agency Humanitarian Programme, which dealt with {{problems}} of Iraq's border areas.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament has 20 Standing Committees {{consisting}} of 25 to 71 MEPs each (reflecting the political make-up {{of the whole}} Parliament) including a chair, a bureau and secretariat. They meet twice a month in public to draw up, amend to adopt legislative proposals and reports to {{be presented to the}} plenary. The rapporteurs for a committee are supposed to present the view of the committee, although notably this has not always been the case. In the events leading to the resignation of the Santer Commission, the <b>rapporteur</b> went against the Budgetary Control Committee's narrow vote to discharge the budget, and urged the Parliament to reject it.|$|E
5|$|Vasile Kogălniceanu, the {{youngest}} son, was noted for {{his involvement in}} agrarian and left-wing politics during the early 20th century. A founder of Partida Țărănească (which served as an inspiration for the Peasants' Party after 1918), he was a collaborator of Vintilă Rosetti in campaigning for the universal suffrage and legislating Sunday rest. A manifesto to the peasants, issued by him just before the Peasants' Revolt of 1907, was interpreted by the authorities as a call to rebellion, and led to Kogălniceanu's imprisonment for a duration of five months. A member of the Chamber of Deputies for Ilfov County, {{he served as a}} <b>rapporteur</b> for the Alexandru Averescu executive during the 1921 debates regarding an extensive land reform.|$|E

5|$|On Süleyman's {{explicit}} advice, {{a revolutionary}} delegation was dispatched to Istanbul, {{where it was}} to negotiate the movement's official recognition—among the envoys were Bălcescu, Ștefan Golescu, and Dimitrie Bolintineanu. By that moment, Russian diplomats had persuaded the Porte to adopt a more reserved attitude, and to replace Süleyman with a <b>rapporteur</b> for the Divan, Fuat Pasha. In parallel, Russia ordered its troops in Bessarabia to prepare for an intervention over the Prut River and into Bucharest—the prospect of a Russo-Turkish war was inconvenient for Abdülmecid, {{at a time when}} the French Second Republic and the United Kingdom failed to clarify their positions in respect to Ottoman policies. Stratford Canning, the British Ambassador to the Porte, even advised Ottoman officials to intervene against the Revolution, thus serving Prime Minister Palmerston's policy regarding the preservation of Ottoman rule in the face of outside pressures. The Wallachian delegation was denied reception, and, after a prolonged stay, had to return to Bucharest.|$|E
5|$|Several {{sources have}} {{reported}} 610 officers as {{being involved in}} or ordering the torture of Falun Gong adherents in custody. In a letter to Chinese leaders in 2005, prominent human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng relayed accounts of 610 officers beating and sexually assaulting Falun Gong practitioners: “of all the true accounts of incredible violence that I have heard, of all {{the records of the}} government’s inhuman torture of its own people, what has shaken me most is the routine practice {{on the part of the}} 6–10 Office and the police of assaulting women’s genitals,” wrote Gao. Defector Hao Fengjun described witnessing one of his 610 Office colleagues beating an elderly female Falun Gong practitioner with an iron bar. The event helped catalyze Hao's decision to defect to Australia. The 2009 report of the UN Special <b>Rapporteur</b> on Extrajudicial Killings relayed allegations that the 610 Office was involved in the torture deaths of Falun Gong practitioners ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of judicial {{members on the}} Council may also pose additional problems. There is a possibility of conflict of interest for judges who sit {{as members of the}} Council if they find themselves having to review the very Acts of Parliament that they have either endorsed or rejected previously. This is exacerbated {{by the fact that the}} Council, in examining the legitimacy of Bills, plays a quasi-judicial role. There may be confusion as regards the legality of a piece of legislation if, for example, it was initially condemned by the Council but enacted by the Government and later endorsed by the courts upon judicial review. When the potential conflict between the Chief Justice's role as head of the judiciary and as Chairman of the Council was raised in 2010 by Githu Muigai, the United Nations Special <b>Rapporteur</b> on Contemporary Forms of Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Tolerance, he was informed that the Chief Justice would recuse himself from any matter in which a conflict arose.|$|E
25|$|The President of the Court of Justice {{is elected}} from {{and by the}} judges for a {{renewable}} term of three years. The president presides over hearings and deliberations, directing both judicial business and administration (for example, the time table of the Court and Grand Chamber). He also assigns cases to the chambers for examination and appoints judge as <b>rapporteurs</b> (reporting judges). The Council may also appoint assistant <b>rapporteurs</b> to assist the President in applications for interim measures and to assist <b>rapporteurs</b> {{in the performance of}} their duties.|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we examine the <b>rapporteur’s</b> role in the {{emergence}} of collective judgments in the Brazilian Supreme Court (STF). Our point of departure is a series of interviews Virgílio Afonso da Silva conducted with Justices and former Justices of the STF, regarding the <b>rapporteur’s</b> role in the process of formulating the court’s decisions. After introducing the interviews, we propose a number of conceptual premises regarding the nature of group judgments. We then consider a particular aspect of the STF’s decision-making process: the regular use, in the syllabi, of the expression “in the terms of the <b>rapporteur’s</b> opinion”. We argue that the most compelling interpretation of this expression is that the court’s decision attributes the collective reasons for deciding to the <b>rapporteur’s</b> opinion. Finally, we identify three possible alternatives to the interpretation of the collective component of the STF decisions. We conclude there is sound evidence for assuming that the court’s understanding of itself, as expressed in its decisions, confirms the hypothesis that the court attributes its own reasons for making the decision to the <b>rapporteur’s</b> opinion...|$|R
40|$|Inter{{national}} audienceThis article {{argues that}} MEPs from national parties {{represented in the}} Council of Ministers are more active as <b>rapporteurs</b> on Codecision legislation than MEPs from national parties not represented in the Council. EP <b>rapporteurs</b> {{can be thought of}} as informed actors offering non-binding advice to the EP plenary. Expert committees and the Council presidency play a similar role in the Council. Compared with <b>rapporteurs</b> from parties not represented in the Council, EP <b>rapporteurs</b> from parties represented in the Council may incur lower costs in coordinating their proposals with the informed actors in the Council. If this is the case, they should be more interested in writing Codecision reports than are MEPs from parties not represented in the Council. This possibility is investigated using a data set consisting of all Codecision legislation initiated by the Commission between 1999 and 2004...|$|R

25|$|A United Nations Special <b>Rapporteur</b> {{undertook}} {{a mission to}} Mexico in 2002 to investigate reports by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights that the country's judiciary and administration of law was not independent. During {{the course of his}} visit to a number of cities, the <b>rapporteur</b> observed that corruption in the judiciary had not been reduced significantly. One of the principal issues is that, because the federal courts operate at a relatively high level, most citizens are compelled to seek justice in the inadequate state courts. Additionally, the <b>rapporteur</b> expressed concerns about such issues as disorganization in the legal profession, difficulties and harassment faced by lawyers, poor trial procedures, poor access to the justice system for indigenous peoples and minors, and lacklustre investigation of many crimes.|$|E

40|$|In the European Parliament, a ‘rapporteur’ is an MEP {{appointed}} {{to oversee the}} drafting and presentation of reports.

Steffen Hurka, Michael Kaeding and Lukas Obholzer present findings from {{a study of the}} allocation of <b>rapporteurs</b> in the 2009 - 14 parliament.
