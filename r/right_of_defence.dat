500|$|The Vietnamese {{judicial}} system {{is based upon}} Socialist legality. The country's highest judicial organ is the Supreme People's Court (SPC). The composition of the SCP includes the Chief Justice, Deputy Chief Judge, jurors and court secretaries. The structure of the SCP (from the top down) is as follows: Council of Judges, Commission of Judges, Central Military Court, Criminal Court, Civil Court, Appeal Court, and assisting staff. The Chief Judge of the SCP is elected by the National Assembly, while the President of the Socialist Republic {{has the power to}} nominate and dismiss the Deputy Chief Judge and judges at the Chief Judge's request. The Central Committee of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front introduces People's Jurors, which are in turn appointed by the Standing Committee of the National Assembly. According to the Government Web Portal, the operating principles of the courts are, during hearings, that the [...] "judges and jurors are independent and only obey the laws." [...] Justice and democracy within the system is supposedly ensured because legal decision-making is an open process. Jurors play an essential role, and defenders have the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>defence</b> and to hire a lawyer.|$|E

60|$|She may be put last {{among the}} local figures I have here described, {{for the special}} reason that her case has this rather deeper significance. For it is not {{possible}} to remain content with the fact that the crowd offers such varied shapes and colours to the eye, when it also offers much deeper divisions and even dilemmas to the intelligence. The black dress of the Moslem woman and the white dress of the Christian woman are in sober truth as different as black and white. They stand for real principles in a real opposition; and the black and white will not easily disappear in the dull grey of our own compromises. The one tradition will defend what it regards as modesty, and the other what it regards as dignity, with passions far deeper than most of our paltry political appetites. Nor do I see how we can deny such a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>defence,</b> even in the case we consider the less enlightened. It is made all the more difficult by the fact that those who consider themselves the pioneers of enlightenment generally also consider themselves the protectors of native races and aboriginal rights. Whatever view we take of the Moslem Arab, we must at least admit that the greater includes the less. It is manifestly absurd to say we have no right to interfere in his country, but have a right to interfere in his home.|$|E

60|$|Sect. 239. In {{these cases}} Barclay, the great {{champion}} of absolute monarchy, {{is forced to}} allow, that a king may be resisted, and ceases to be a king. That is, in short, not to multiply cases, in whatsoever he has no authority, there he is no king, and may be resisted: for wheresoever the authority ceases, the king ceases too, and becomes like other men who have no authority. And these two cases he instances in, differ little from those above mentioned, to be destructive to governments, only that he has omitted the principle from which his doctrine flows: and that is, the breach of trust, in not preserving the form of government agreed on, and in not intending the end of government itself, which is the public good and preservation of property. When a king has dethroned himself, and put himself {{in a state of}} war with his people, what shall hinder them from prosecuting him who is no king, as they would any other man, who has put himself into a state of war with them, Barclay, and those of his opinion, would do well to tell us. This farther I desire may be taken notice of out of Barclay, that he says, The mischief that is designed them, the people may prevent before it be clone: whereby he allows resistance when tyranny is but in design. Such designs as these (says he) when any king harbours in his thoughts and seriously promotes, he immediately gives up all care and thought of the commonwealth; so that, according to him, the neglect of the public good is to be taken as an evidence of such design, or at least for a sufficient cause of resistance. And the reason of all, he gives in these words, Because he betrayed or forced his people, whose liberty he ought carefully to have preserved. What he adds, into the power and dominion of a foreign nation, signifies nothing, the fault and forfeiture lying in the loss of their liberty, which he ought to have preserved, and not in any distinction of the persons to whose dominion they were subjected. The peoples right is equally invaded, and their liberty lost, whether they are made slaves to any of their own, or a foreign nation; and in this lies the injury, and against this only have they the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>defence.</b> And there are instances to be found in all countries, which shew, {{that it is not the}} change of nations in the persons of their governors, but the change of government, that gives the offence. Bilson, a bishop of our church, and a great stickler for the power and prerogative of princes, does, if I mistake not, in his treatise of Christian subjection, acknowledge, that princes may forfeit their power, and their title to the obedience of their subjects; and if there needed authority in a case where reason is so plain, I could send my reader to Bracton, Fortescue, and the author of the Mirrour, and others, writers that cannot be suspected to be ignorant of our government, or enemies to it. But I thought Hooker alone might be enough to satisfy those men, who relying on him for their ecclesiastical polity, are by a strange fate carried to deny those principles upon which he builds it. Whether they are herein made the tools of cunninger workmen, to pull down their own fabric, they were best look. This I am sure, their civil policy is so new, so dangerous, and so destructive to both rulers and people, that as former ages never could bear the broaching of it; so it may be hoped, those to come, redeemed from the impositions of these Egyptian under-task-masters, will abhor the memory of such servile flatterers, who, whilst it seemed to serve their turn, resolved all government into absolute tyranny, and would have all men born to, what their mean souls fitted them for, slavery.|$|E

40|$|The European Commission has {{extensive}} {{powers to}} investigate and enforce infringements of EU competition law. Its investigations under Article 101 TFEU may result in extensive fines amounting up to almost a billion euros. In these proceedings the Commission is entrusted with three roles which are usually difficult to combine within one and same institution. It conducts the investigations, decides on sanctions {{as well as it}} to a certain extent adopts the rules of conduct for its procedure. The Commission is entrusted with a margin of appreciation which to a certain extent limits the CJEU’s judicial review of its decisions. There seems to be a conflict between the need to protect business secrets and other confidential information and the investigated undertakings’ need to access information in the Commission file in order to effectively exercise their <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>defence.</b> This study examines which protection <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> to access the Commission file undertakings, subject to investigation under Article 101 (1) TFEU, have under the fundamental <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> European Union. The study examines the requirements relating to file access under the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>defence</b> as provided by Article 6 ECHR. The conclusions made are that undertakings’ right to access the Commission file in proceeding under Article 101 TFEU is protected under Article 41, 47 and 48 of the CFREU. The limitations of the investigated undertakings’ right to access the Commission file are not violating their <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>defence,</b> as the Commission’s extensive powers are counterbalanced in several ways. An efficient control of the Commission’s use of its powers is however necessary to avoid a risk for abuse of the powers in question. ...|$|R
