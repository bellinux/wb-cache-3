40|$|Abstract Generally, the {{retaining}} wall is becoming unstable as the height is higher. On the other hand, the {{retaining wall}} with the <b>relieving</b> <b>platform</b> is more stable and more economical {{than any other}} type of retaining wall, because the <b>relieving</b> <b>platform</b> the reduce the lateral earth pressure. In this study, numerical analyses were carried out for 15 cases varying with the type of retaining wall, length and location of the <b>relieving</b> <b>platform</b> and the backfill type. From the numerical analyses, the reduction of the lateral earth pressure was checked and the results of numerical analyses were compared with that of model tests and theoretical equations. As the results of this study, the lateral earth pressure of the retaining wall with the <b>relieving</b> <b>platform</b> is considerably less than that of cantilever wall.

40|$|In {{cases where}} the sheet pilling is allowed, when great {{retaining}} heights have to be achieved a combined quay wall structure is normally used. This structure consists of a sheet pile wall, a <b>relieving</b> <b>platform,</b> an anchor and a pile foundation system. The content of the present MSc thesis {{is divided into two}} major parts. The first part (Part A 0 contains mostly hand calculations for the determination of the loads and for the analysis of the sheet pile wall, while on the second part (Part B) advanced computer programs will be used for the same purpose. A parametric analysis of seven different quay walls is investigated, for various loading combinations of given loads. In details, three different depths and two different widths of the <b>relieving</b> <b>platform</b> were investigated. In addition a quay wall combined only from sheet piles, without a <b>relieving</b> <b>platform</b> is also analysed. 1) The sheet pile wall, in Part A, is analysed by three different approaching theories of Blum. The fixity of the end point of the sheet piling is considered once as completely free and in the other two as fully fixed. Graphs concerning the effect of the various dimensions of the <b>relieving</b> <b>platform,</b> the embedded depth and the anchor force are produced. 2) In the Elastic Supported Beam theory (Msheet) analysis the ground is simulated according to a more advanced model. According to that theory, the Sheet Pile Wall is schematised as a beam on an elastic foundation, where the ground is simulated by a set of uncoupled elasto-plastic springs. 3) In Part B, the Finite Elements Method. PLAXIS created from Plaxis is used for that purpose. This type of analysis is based on a model in which the behaviour of soil and structure are integrated. Through a parametric analysis and a financial assessment of a quay wall, the economic effects of the <b>relieving</b> <b>platform</b> separately on the sheet pile wall and on the whole structure is estimated.

40|$|Piles {{supporting}} marine {{structures such as}} jetties, <b>relieving</b> <b>platforms,</b> quay {{walls and}} fixed offshore structures are subjected to lateral loads due to berthing and mooring forces, wind, waves, storm surges and current forces. This paper presents some factors that affect the design of pile groups supporting marine structures founded in cohesionless soils. Some main aspects {{that should be considered}} in the pile group design are addressed such as pile batter angle, pile group arrangement, pile spacing, pile slenderness ratio and magnitude of lateral static loading. Numerical analyses were conducted to investigate these design aspects with and without impact of scour. Different scour depths were considered to cover the possible root causes of scour around pile groups such as waves, current and ship propeller jets. The study revealed that scour has greater impact on lateral loading of pile groups compared to its impact on single piles. Pile groups with side-by-side arrangement exposed to scour are more critical than single piles and piles groups with tandem arrangement due to the combined effect of scour and pile-soil-pile interaction. It is also concluded that scour protection is not always required. More attention and considerations should be given to scour protection around piles especially if the piles are closely spaced, arranged side-by-side and if slenderness ratio is less than 12. 5...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{and design of}} sheet pile structure involves problems of complex soil structure interaction. The actual performance of the sheet pile for the given site conditions {{is found to be}} very difficult to predict as it is influenced by various parameters such as, the angle of internal friction, position of the ground water table, position of anchor, density of soil, tidal variation, surcharge load, type of construction etc. Sheet pile quay wall with <b>relieving</b> <b>platform</b> is suitable wherever unsuitable soil prevents usage of conventional anchorages and large superimposed loads from super structure requiring bearing piles to support them. The analysis of sheet pile wall with <b>relieving</b> <b>platform</b> for layered soil is based on the iterative technique, which when performed manually can be extremely tedious. A software RELPT 6. 0 has been developed based on the deterministic classical design approach for the {{analysis and}} design of sheet pile wall with <b>relieving</b> <b>platform,</b> adhering to the Indian standard codes; using Visual basic 6. 0. The software provides the embedded depth required for the stability of the sheet pile quay wall, loads on each pile and the structural design of the cross section of the quay wall, supporting piles and the platform. The software is event driven and extremely user friendly with graphical outputs, which enables the user to analyze the outputs more accurately. The outputs of the software are compared with the manually obtained results and the variation is found to be quite small.

40|$|Future-proof {{design of}} quay walls is an {{interesting}} issue in civil Engineering, because of the dynamic environment in which quay walls are operating. Designers are confronted with time-changing requirements such as larger retaining heights and heavier loads. However, a technical and financial analysis has revealed that the design of new quay structures can, under certain conditions, be made future-proof by standardization. By standardizing the design, this may achieve {{a certain degree of}} flexibility. This means that a quay wall can be converted for multiple types of vessels or multiple types of cargo and therefore becomes future-proof. Various standard principle solutions are applicable. However, {{it should be noted that}} the exact dimensions of quay wall components, for instance the substructure (the front wall) and the superstructure (the capping beam or <b>relieving</b> <b>platform),</b> can in principle not be standardized. The dimensions depend namely on major factors such as local geotechnical conditions, surcharges, retaining height and the presence of a <b>relieving</b> <b>platform.</b> Nevertheless, standardization is possible in two ways. Firstly, by driving the front wall to a deeper layer than it is necessary in the first instance and dredging the front side of the quay wall at a later stage. This can be done by constructing all quay walls at equal depth, by area. This is a decision based on the local depth of the navigation channels and the expected business activity in the different areas. Secondly, by making a strategic choice for a particular quay component or a particular port area. Both ways lead to higher initial investment costs but results in a quay wall which is significantly more future-proof. From a technical and financial assessment it can be concluded that when heavy loads and large retaining heights are involved, a combined steel quay wall with a concrete <b>relieving</b> <b>platform</b> (often used by deep-seagoing vessels) is suitable and for inland barges an anchored combined wall should be applied. In case of a <b>relieving</b> <b>platform,</b> the floor should be located at NAP- 2 m with a length of 15 m. Quay walls used by inland barges should consist of a capping beam and a combined wall.

40|$|The {{stability}} of any structure {{is an important}} aspect in civil engineering. The subject of this thesis is the {{stability of}} the quay structure at the Amazonehaven, port of Rotterdam. The reason for writing this report is to investigate the safety and stability of the quay structure, which was built in 1990, throughout its service lifetime while the toe of the combined wall was deformed. The focal point is the behaviour of the quay structure, specifically the combined wall. The method based on finite element method, Plaxis 3 D, which takes into account the 3 -dimensional effects of the quay structure and considers the actual soil behaviour during calculation is a more sophisticated manner for modelling a quay structure. For this thesis a calibration model (which is the actual designed of the quay structure) and a series of models with different penetration depths of the combined wall are modelled in Plaxis 3 D. A comparison is made between the calibration model and model 2 B (which was the actual situation of the combined wall in reality). The calibration model which is modelled with or without surcharge turned out to be stable enough to withstand the design loads as did model 2 B. After safety analysis (phi, c-reduction) of the soil parameters in both models the safety factor proved to be slightly smaller than 1. 5 which indicates that the safety margin used in the previous design calculations were correct. It is advised to design quay structure with <b>relieving</b> <b>platform</b> structures with finite element method, Plaxis 3 D. This provides a 3 -dimensional view of how the foundation elements and <b>relieving</b> <b>platform</b> structure work and {{the stability of the}} quay structure can be modelled in detail. The finite element method, Plaxis 3 D, is a better simulation program of the reality however this program is very time-consuming when accurately trying to model the quay structure in Plaxis 3 D.

40|$|A {{maritime}} domain or region contains a number w of nonhostile W (White) vessels of interest. Hostile R (Red) vessels enter the domain. The Rs are {{traveling through the}} domain toward targets. Overhead, friendly (Blue) sensors (S) patrol the domain and classify (perhaps incorrectly) detected vessels of interest as R or W. The misclassification of a W as an R is a false positive. An overhead sensor follows (or tracks) any vessel it classifies as R until it is <b>relieved</b> by another <b>platform,</b> perhaps a destroyer pair (DD). The overhead sensor is here assumed unable to detect and classify additional vessels while it is following a suspicious vessel; this {{may well be a}} somewhat pessimistic assumption, very possibly richer possibilities based on additional assets (such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)) are available, but loss of track may occur as well as misclassification. Deterministic and stochastic models are formulated and studied to evaluate the probability that Rs are successfully neutralized before reaching their destination. The model results quantify the effect of the resources and time needed to prosecute misclassified Ws (false positives) on the probability of successfully neutralizing R. The results indicate that the probability of neutralizing an R vessel is very sensitive to the false positive rate. Technologies, processes, and procedures that can decrease the false positive rate will increase the effectiveness of the Maritime Intercept Operation (MIO). [...] p. iii...|$|R

International Series in Operations Research and Management Science, Vol. 128, Springer, New York, 2009. A domain {{contains}} a number w of non-hostile White (W) individuals: humans, vehicles, ships. A hostile Red (R) individual enters the domain and travels through the domain towards targets. If R reaches an attractive valuable target, perhaps {{a crowd of}} people on land or a ship at sea containing liquid natural gas (LNG), it attacks the target. A Blue counter-terrorist, C, patrols the domain and classifies (perhaps incorrectly) individuals of interest as R or W. The probability of correct classification is an increasing function of the time spent classifying an individual. The misclassification of a W as an R is a false positive; misclassification of the R as a W is a false negative. C follows (or tracks) any individual it classifies as R until it is <b>relieved</b> by another <b>platform</b> or individual that may neutralize the possible R. C is unable to detect and classify additional individuals while it is following a suspicious individual. A small classification time may yield many false positives that C must service. A large classification time may result in R achieving its goal before being neutralized, so an appropriate compromise is sought. A game-theoretic model is formulated and studied to evaluate the probability that R is successfully neutralized before achieving its goal. C’s policy is to choose a classification time. Targets have independent identically distributed (iid) values, and R’s policy is to specify a target value threshold; R will attack the first target it finds whose value exceeds the threshold unless neutralized first...|$|R
40|$|Since 1970 costal {{structures}} in the Port of Koper are designed as reinforced concrete slabs founded on vertical and inclined steel piles with a slope under the deck. This method of construction requires the excavation of large quantities of silt with bad characteristics, which is used mainly for acquiring new surfaces. The amount of pumped silt, derived from construction of new docks and deepening waterways, exceeds needs. Therefore {{it is necessary to}} take the extra silt elsewhere, which represents an increasing cost for the port. In the thesis is analyzed the possibility of using sheet pile wall on the particular case of the extension of dock number 11. The proposed coastal structure consists of concrete slab founded on steel tubular piles and steel sheet pile wall, which has a soil retaining and bearing function. This method of construction does not required addition excavations. Because of the complexity of the structure, individual elements and appropriate geometry models are acquired step by step. Initially the possibility of using a concrete slab on ground level founded on steel tubular piles and combined sheet pile wall that consist of different types of primary and secondary elements is analyzed. Because of the poor bearing capacity of the soil such type of structure is not an option. The following steps show the need of anchorage, inclination of piles and sheet wall and a <b>relieving</b> <b>platform.</b> Deep <b>relieving</b> <b>platform</b> 4 m below the ground anchored by Müller-Verfahren piles with inclined tubular piles at an gradient of 3 : 1 and sheet pile wall at a gradient of 5, 5 : 1 is appropriate.

40|$|The {{stability}} of any structure {{is an important}} aspect in civil engineering. This aspect {{is the subject of}} the researched quay wall at the Amazonehaven, port of Rotterdam.

To obtain a better insight into the concept of stability, analytical methods based on the Blum theory, beam on elastic foundation method and finite element method using Plaxis 3 D were applied and compared. The finite element method, Plaxis 3 D, proved to be a better method to investigate the quay wall.

40|$|In this thesis, an {{investigation}} is described to the measured horizontal displacements of a quay {{wall in the}} Port of Rotterdam. This quay wall was built in 2003 to replace an existing jetty. A combined tubular wall was installed {{and some of the}} concrete jetty piles were reused as foundation piles for the <b>relieving</b> <b>platform.</b> Anchorage for the quay wall is provided by an eight meter high continuous anchor wall, 38 meter behind the quay wall made of steel sheet piles. The connection between the two walls consists of high strength steel presetressed strands. Prior to describing the actual research in this report, measurements are considered that have been carried out over time on top of the quay wall. These measurements indicate that horizontal displacements increase nonlinearly in time. This trend was the reason for {{an investigation}} to all possible causes of the horizontal displacements of the combi wall. In this thesis, the research is discussed and possible causes of the measurements are revealed by considering one representative cross section of the largest part of the quay wall. The main part of this thesis deals with the investigation for possible causes of the measurements and is elaborated by considering the different influences for the representative cross section. Firstly, time dependent soil behaviour is examined. The Koppejan formula and the finite element method are used to determine the influences of consolidation and creep. Due to counteracting prestressing and gravity forces the effects in time due to consolidation and creep seems to be negligible. Secondly, the capacity of the anchor wall is investigated based on Coulomb’s theory and the finite element method. Due to a proven densification of the passive soil wedge, the capacity appeared to be sufficient. Subsequently, macro stability of the soil body between the anchor and combined wall (Kranz stability) is considered. Stability is proven to be sufficient by performing a hand calculation for the drained and undrained situation, followed by a verification calculation with a program based on the sub grade reaction method. Another considered possible cause is the difference in interpretation of the soil profile used in this report and the one used in the design. Therefore, a parametric study for the soil parameters is performed with the sub grade reaction method. These calculations show that the design profile resulted in larger deformations than a soil profile with expected values. Furthermore, it was decided to investigate the influence of the position and magnitude of a surcharge load. When the design load of 50 kN/m 2 is applied near the anchor wall, it was concluded from calculations that horizontal displacements are almost equal to the measurements. When a higher load is applied at positions further away from the anchor wall, again horizontal displacements appeared to be close to the measured displacements. Both the position and magnitude of loading are described as possible explanations for the measured deformations. Finally, it is concluded that saving money in the design stage by applying an anchor wall, resulted in more deformations than expected and made them dependent on the position of loading. Additionally, it is concluded that applying a higher load than was agreed upon in the terms of reference, resulted in more deformations than expected as well.

40|$|Since the Web 2. 0 advent, Web {{users have}} gained {{more and more}} power moving their role from simple {{information}} consumers to producers. In line with this trend, mashup technologies have immediately attracted {{a lot of attention}} and many research investments since their birth. The big mashup promise was to bring application development to the masses, so that any Web-educated worker, also non-IT skilled, could implement his/her own situational applications (i. e., relatively small applications meant to address a temporary need of one or few persons) exploiting the simple paradigms and visual metaphors provided by mashup tools. After a decade from the first mashup tools, though, mashups are not really part of people’s everyday life and are still rather unknown technologies that — beside some exceptions — hardly find concrete application in the real world. During our research in this field our high-level goal was to foster the adoption of mashup technologies by end users. Aiming at this, we identified three main characteristics that must be reached by mashup technologies to get to the expected diffusion: (i) usefulness and (ii) usability for the end users and (iii) affordability for the developers of the respective mashup tools (in terms of required skills, time and cost). We identified lacks in these achievements as main hindering factors for the wide adoption of mashup technologies. Making mashup technologies useful, usable and affordable, therefore, are the three main challenges we addressed in our research work. This work contributes to the achievement of all these three major goals: first, by enabling a so-called universal integration paradigm, focussing on the creation of more powerful and complete mashups allowing data, application logic and user interface integration in one single language and tool; then, by introducing and developing domain specific mashup technologies, able to lower mashups’ complexity and make them usable by domain experts (i. e., end users expert of a given target domain); finally, by realizing a system able to generate domain specific mashup platforms as a service, basically <b>relieving</b> developers of <b>platforms</b> implementation and, therefore, making platform development affordable. This thesis specifically focusses on the last two points, i. e., on the domain specific mashup approach and on the semi-automatic generation of domain specific mashup platforms...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} of quay walls {{is a problem in}} which people are interested for ages. There are many methods and recommendations developed for this topic. They differ for each country and type of structure and are developed for local conditions. Some of these methods and recommendations are collected in a national code, which can be used for the design of maritime structures. In Europe they try to normalize all national codes to obtain one European standard. Each of the European members can add their national parameters to this code. For the normalization of codes it is interesting to investigate which codes are available and which methods are used in the national codes. In this analysis are the difference between design guidelines for quay walls considered, with special attention to the safety analysis and design process, to find an overview of design results. Therefore first a global analysis of contents is carried out. This results in 4 guidelines with a clear safety approach, also adapted to the latest design philosophies: CUR 166 and Handbook Quay Walls (both Dutch), EAU 2004 (German), Eurocode 7 (European Union). The last one is not used, because it is still under construction and includes mainly the safety approaches treated in the other 3 guidelines. For CUR 166, Handbook Quay Walls and EAU 2004 comparative calculations are carried out in a beam on elastic foundation model. Two cases are considered which are very typical for quay walls in the Port of Rotterdam: a quay wall with 12 m retaining height and a quay wall with 30 m retaining height (this one includes a superstructure). First, for all guidelines the characteristic parameters are determined: water levels, geotechnical properties and external loads. The geometrical aspects and material parameters are kept the same for the analysis. The safety approach in the guidelines give the greatest difference in the design process. If a fault tree is present, the failure mechanism can be overviewed, which is very useful for design calculations. Mainly the application of safety factors on actions or action effects lead to different answers. The CUR 166 applies safety factors on soil strength parameters (actions), the Handbook Quay walls and EAU 2004 applies the safety factors on action effects (internal forces). The EAU 2004 gives in all calculations the smallest bending moments and anchor forces for the application in a beam on elastic foundation program. This is mainly due to the higher strength of the soil properties in the EAU 2004 and {{due to the fact that}} the Blum schematization does not satisfy in the beam on elastic foundation program. For the calculation of case 1 (retaining height 12 m) the Handbook Quay Walls gives higher bending moments than CUR 166, mainly due to the application of a special load combination with extreme scour. For the calculations of case 2 (retaining height 30 m) the CUR 166 gives higher bending moments than Handbook Quay Walls. This is mainly due to the application of the <b>relieving</b> <b>platform</b> in combination with safety factors on the soil strength parameters, which results in higher bending moments. It can be concluded that the EAU 2004 is not useful for application in a beam on elastic foundation program. The CUR 166 and Handbook Quay Walls are very useful for a beam on elastic foundation method. Mainly the Handbook Quay Walls is very specialized on quay walls structures. It includes certain load combinations, descriptions for the calculation of a superstructure and applies partial safety factors on action effects. This makes the Handbook Quay Walls more useful for the design of quay wall structures than CUR 166. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
