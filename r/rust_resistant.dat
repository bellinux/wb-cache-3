25|$|In {{backcross}} conversion, {{genes are}} introgressed from a donor cultivar or related species into a recipient elite line through repeated backcrossing. A {{problem in this}} procedure {{is being able to}} identify the lines carrying the trait of interest at each generation. The problem is particularly acute if the trait of interest is recessive, as it will be present only in a heterozygous condition after each backcross. The development of molecular markers provides an easier method of selection based on the genotype (marker) rather than the phenotype. Combined with doubled haploidy it becomes more effective. In marker assisted backcross conversion, a recipient parent is crossed with a donor line and the hybrid (F1) backcrossed to the recipient. The resulting generation (BC1) is backcrossed and the process repeated until the desired genotypes are produced. The combination of doubled haploidy and molecular marker provides the short cut. In the back cross generation one itself a genotype with the character of interest can be selected and converted into homozygous doubled haploid genotype. Chen et al. (1994) used marker assisted backcross conversion with doubled haploidy of BC1 individuals to select stripe <b>rust</b> <b>resistant</b> lines in barley.|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina, {{has increased dramatically}} {{in recent years in}} durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum) worldwide. Little is known on the occurrence and nature of resistance in this crop. Thirty durum wheat lines derived from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) were characterized for their resistance to the Mexican P. triticina race BBG/BN which was identified in 2001 and caused susceptibility {{of a large number of}} the world's durum wheat cultivars. Ten genotypes with race-specific resistance displayed low to intermediate seedling reactions to leaf rust. In the field, eight genotypes were immune and two displayed moderate levels of resistance. The slow <b>rusting</b> <b>resistant</b> lines displayed a range of disease severity responses indicating genetic diversity. The yield protection conferred by race-specific and slow rusting resistance was investigated in yield loss trials under high leaf rust pressure in the field. Race-specific resistance provided effective protection against yield losses caused by leaf rust. Yield losses for slow <b>rusting</b> <b>resistant</b> lines were higher than for immune race-specific resistant ones, but significantly lower than for the susceptible checks. Slow rusting lines with high resistance levels and reduced yield losses were identified. The slow rusting components; latent period, uredinium size and receptivity, were determined in greenhouse experiments, and associations of these components with leaf rust progress in the field were calculated. The results indicated that predominantly uredinium size contributed to slow leaf rust progress in durum wheat. The genetic basis and diversity of race-specific resistance was also determined in progenies from crosses of nine durum wheat lines with a leaf rust susceptible parent, and from intercrosses among the resistant parents. Five distinct sources of resistance were identified, four of which involved single partially, or completely, dominant genes, of which two were closely linked, and a pair of partially dominant complementary genes. Using molecular tools, the two linked genes were located on the long arm of chromosome 6 B. The best slow <b>rusting</b> <b>resistant</b> lines and the five distinct race-specific resistance sources can be used for enhancing the diversity and durability of leaf rust resistance in durum wheat...|$|R

In this work, two collections of genotypes have been characterized for their leaf rust resistance both in field trials (in Spain and Mexico) and in the greenhouse (with an array of Spanish pathotypes). The first collection included 14 cultivars and lines, mostly from CIMMYT origin, plus six genotypes with known resistance genes. The second collection comprised 29 cultivars commercially available in Spain, plus 11 landraces from the Spanish germplasm bank.

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici) {{has been}} {{receiving}} increased {{attention in the}} USA since the appearance of more virulent races detected in the past decade. These races caused yield losses even {{in areas where the}} disease previously was rarely detected. Host plant resistance is the most cost effective and environmentally friendly means of controlling stripe rust. Deployment of single, major genes for resistance has been compromised due to the genetic variability of the pathogen, emphasizing the need to breed for durable resistance. 'Stephens' wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) has been grown commercially in the Pacific Northwest region of the USA for 30 years and shows resistance to P. striiformis f. sp. tritici "old" and "new" races. The durable resistance of Stephens to stripe rust is believed to be due to a combination of seedling and adult plant resistance genes. Multilocation field trials and molecular genotyping were used to study the genetics of the resistance response in 'Stephens'. Disease severity, based on the percentage of leaf area infected in field plots, was recorded in eight locations: five in 2008 and three in 2009. Locations could be divided into two mega-environments based on time of appearance of disease and QTL identified. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis identified 11 chromosomal regions associated with resistance to stripe <b>rust</b> in the <b>resistant</b> parent ('Stephens') and two regions derived from the susceptible parent ('Platte').

The experimental design was an factorial 3 x 3 + untreated control, that involve the factors dose (0, 25, 0, 30 and 0, 35 L. ha- 1) and application rate (143, 286 and 429 L. ha- 1). The second experiment used the BRS 208 cultivar (<b>resistant</b> to leaf <b>rust</b> and moderately <b>resistant</b> to yellow spot). The experimental design was an factorial 2 x 2 + untreated control, consisting the factors dose (0, 2 and 0, 3 L. ha- 1) and application rate (143 and 286 L. ha- 1).

40|$|AbstractBackground:Infiltration {{of local}} {{anaesthetic}} {{into an area}} before incising with a scalpel is common surgical practice. After a chance observation that a carbon steel scalpel rusted within minutes of contact with local anaesthetic, the corrosive effects of normal saline and local anaesthetic solutions on carbon and stainless steel surgical blades were investigated. Methods:After a series of preliminary studies with approximately fifty scalpels, we used a semi-quantitative technique using digital photography to demonstrate the corrosive effect of local anaesthetic on twelve carbon steel scalpel blades. These blades were exposed to saline, lignocaine and bupivacaine, and the surface changes were recorded and compared. A stainless steel blade was also photographed for comparison. Results:All blades were found to rust in all three solutions, but there were considerable differences {{in the rate of}} progression and the surface area of the blade affected. Corrosive effects occurred rapidly on the carbon steel blades when exposed to all solutions, the process beginning within minutes of immersion. The overall effect was most marked with blades partially immersed in local anaesthetic. The stainless steel blades were much more <b>resistant</b> <b>rusting,</b> but had started to corrode by twelve hours, and were substantially rusty after 24 hours. Total immersion in solution produced minimal effects and thus rapid corrosion requires an air-liquid interface. Conclusions:This paper demonstrates the surprisingly rapid speed of corrosion of the standard carbon steel scalpel blade when exposed to solution, especially in the presence of an air-liquid interface. This phenomenon has not been previously described and has a number of implications. In the developing world, scalpels may be re-used, and in such circumstances avoidance of contact with local anaesthetic may increase the life of the blades. In addition, excess tissue damage from the poor performance of a rusted blade may occur and may tattoo the skin with rust. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that iron oxides may have carcinogenic and cytotoxic properties. Carbon steel blades are often preferred as they can be manufactured sharper and cheaper, however, we would recommend either their replacement after contact with local anaesthetic, or the use of stainless steel blades in particular circumstances...|$|R

40|$|Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) is a {{perennial}} forage crop grown in mixture with grasses or as a pure stand. It is valued for its nitrogen fixation capacity, benefits in organic farming, high quality forage, and beneficial {{effects on the}} soil structure. However, the lack of persistence {{is a major problem}} in red clover and the lack of winter hardiness and diseases are the most important reasons. Clover rot (clover cancer or Sclerotinia crown and root rot) is an important disease in European red clover crops, caused by the ascomycete fungi Sclerotinia trifoliorum Erikks. or Sclerotinia sclerotiorum Lib. de Bary, Clover rot is difficult to control because its development is highly dependent on weather conditions. Moreover, resistance breeding is hampered by the lack of useable bio-tests and by the lack of knowledge on the genetic and phenotypic variation among Sclerotinia isolates. In this context, the objectives of this thesis were to analyse the phenotypic and genetic diversity among Sclerotinia populations from European red clover crops, to construct bio-tests for Sclerotinia, to identify possible sources of resistance and factors related with resistance, and to acquire insight in the heritability of clover rot resistance. In {{the first part of this}} dissertation the focus was on the genetic diversity among a collection of 192 Sclerotinia isolates from 25 locations in 12 European countries. Mycelial compatibility grouping provided a first idea of genetic diversity, while an AFLP study disclosed the genetic diversity in more detail. Two Sclerotinia species were present on red clover: S. trifoliorum was found in most locations while S. sclerotiorum was found in locations Fr. A and Fr. B. Genetic differences were found among isolates between and within locations, but there were no subpopulations and genetic distance was not correlated with geographic distance. Within-location variance accounted for 79. 2 % and among location variance for 20. 8 % of the genetic variation within S. trifoliorum isolates, indicating that the degree of population differentiation is low. A species specific PCR based on the -tubulin gene was constructed to quickly discriminate between S. trifoliorum and S. sclerotiorum. Bio-tests were developed for Sclerotinia on red clover. First, ascospore production for S. trifoliorum was optimised. A high-throughput bio-test was optimised: young plants are inoculated a with suspension of ascospores or mycelium fragments and incubated on an ebb and flow table covered with an opaque plastic cap. The disease is scored on a scale from 1 to 5 after incubation at 15 °C during 10 days for mycelium fragment inoculation and 14 days for ascospore inoculation. Additionally, we constructed an in vitro bio-test on detached leaves to analyse plant - pathogen interactions more precisely. Leaves are incubated on 0. 5 % water agar, inoculated with a mycelium plug or by spraying an ascospore suspension and the percentage of leaf damage is calculated after incubation. Both bio-tests were fairly correlated. The phenotypic variation was studied among a sub collection of 30 Sclerotinia isolates. Mycelial growth rate, production of sclerotia and secretion of oxalate were measured and aggressiveness was assessed by both bio-tests. Growth rate, sclerotia production, oxalate production and pathogenicity according to both bio-tests differed between isolates. While fast growing isolates and isolates that were aggressive on detached leaves were more aggressive on plants, isolates that produced numerous sclerotia were less aggressive. A microscopic analysis of the infection process disclosed that the speed of ascospore germination was similar among isolates, yet aggressive isolates grew shorter secondary mycelia and attained more successful penetrations after 48 h. To identify possible sources of resistance in red clover germplasm, a diverse collection of over 121 red clover accessions was screened. Plants were evaluated in the field and susceptibility to clover rot was determined. Accessions differed significantly in susceptibility to clover rot but no completely resistant accessions were found. Isoflavone levels, branching, growth habit and resistance to mildew and virus disease did not affect clover rot susceptibility. High yielding plants and plants susceptible to <b>rust</b> were more <b>resistant</b> to clover rot. Tetraploid cultivars were less susceptible by 11. 7 % than diploid cultivars. Cultivars were generally less susceptible than landraces and wild accessions. Two tetraploid cultivars and one diploid landrace were significantly more resistant. Cultivars and some landraces from both ploidy levels may be the most suitable sources of resistance. In a final part, the inheritance of clover rot resistance was investigated. Analysis of segregation ratios in progenies from 15 pair crosses between ramets of resistant and susceptible genotypes suggested that clover rot resistance was conferred by three major quantitative resistance genes, while at least a part of the resistance was conferred by minor effect genes. Clover rot resistance was not maternally inherited. To estimate the heritability of clover rot resistance, we applied divergent selection by the high-throughput bio-test on an experimental population. Our high-throughput biotest altered the resistance level in both directions in the first generation of selection, but only marginal progress was made in the second generation. The heritability was on average 0. 34 in the first cycle of selection and 0. 07 in the second cycle of selection. The insights obtained during this research offer a basis for resistance breeding. The influence of isolates in resistance breeding is expected to be small. Allocating sources of resistance is difficult, yet recent cultivars and landraces from different genetic backgrounds may be the most suitable. Mass selection is ineffective, yet successive cycles of family selection against a strong selection pressure may increase clover rot resistance. Tetraploidisation of diploid populations may provide an additional level of protection. Finally, attention should be paid to other ways of controlling clover rot, such as culture techniques and biocontrol agents, as they may prevent the disease even more efficiently than cultivars with low susceptibility...|$|R

The exact metallurgical phenomenon underlying this transformation of the surface to make it more <b>rust</b> <b>resistant</b> is not fully understood; however, it is theorized that the remaining wustite layer (chemical symbol FeO) contains a much lower proportion of oxygen than the removed hematite and magnetite layers and is, therefore, more stable and less prone to oxidation when exposed to a noncondensing atmosphere.|$|E

Just 29 years later in 1996, the department's {{research}} was rated as Number 1 by the Institute for Scientific Information in terms of influence in this field. University of Saskatchewan-owned Canadian Light Source opened in 2004, and is an internationally renowned synchrotron science facility. The linear accelerator was the precursor to the Canadian Light source for molecular and nuclear physics research. The U of S synchrotron has produced a world leader in agriculture biotechnology and livestock genomics which also feature breakthroughs in chemistry, geochemistry, pharmacology and proteomics. Winter wheat projects, <b>rust</b> <b>resistant</b> wheat strains, and development of rapeseed were {{just a few of the}} agricultural research developments.|$|E
