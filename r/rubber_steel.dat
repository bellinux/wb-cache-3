After the NLRB decided in favor of the Call-Bulletin's workers in December 1934, the NRA refused to enforce the decision. Unfortunately, President Roosevelt issued a letter on January 22, 1935, requesting that the NLRB decline jurisdiction in a small number of NIRA codes and asking the NLRB to submit any recommendations it did make in such disputes confidentially to the president. The following day, Millis, Biddle, and NLRB member Edwin S. Smith agreed to challenge the president on the jurisdictional issue. Millis and Smith even threatened to resign, causing the collapse of the NLRB, if Roosevelt insisted on enforcing his letter of January 22. Millis, Biddle, and Smith met with the President a few days later. Roosevelt agreed not to enforce his letter, to authorize an NLRB investigation into the Newspaper Industry Board's operations, and to write a letter to the NLRB members and staff promising not to get involved in any more jurisdictional issues.

5000|$|There {{have been}} other claims to the {{invention}} of the mouthguard as well. In the early 1900s, Jacob Marks created a custom fitted mouthguard in London. [...] An American dentist, Thomas A. Carlos, also developed a mouth guard at approximately the same time as Krause. Carlos claimed that he made his first mouthpiece in 1916 and later suggested his invention to the United States Olympian Dinnie O’Keefe in 1919. Another dentist from Chicago, E. Allen Franke, also claimed to have made many mouth guards for boxers by 1919. [...] The mouthguard’s relevance was again brought to the center of attention in a 1927 boxing match between Jack Sharkey and Mike McTigue. McTigue was winning for most of the fight, but a chipped tooth cut his lip, and he was forced to forfeit the match. From that point on, mouthguards were ruled acceptable and soon became commonplace for all boxers. [...] In 1930, descriptions of mouthguards first appeared in dental literature.

It is carried out in sea as well as in creeks and estuaries on the western coast. Marine fishery predominates over inland fishery in the district and provides employment to about 75% of the persons engaged in the fishing industry. Fishing in sea is carried out along the coast stretching over about 110 km. The important fishing centres in the district are Dahanu, Pokharan-Uchheli, Nawapur, Murabe, Satpute, Datiware, Arnala, Vasai and Uran. Food processing industries like grain mill products, Bakery products, Cocoa, Chocolate and Sugar Confectionery, Salt, ice, slaughtering, preparation and preservation of meat, dairy products, canning and preservation of fruits and vegetables, canning, preserving and processing of fish are developed in the district. Raptakos, Brett and Co., Pfizer Ltd., Cadbury Fry (India) Ltd. which produce modified milk food and high protein food are some of the large and medium companies in the district.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{structural}} earthquake engineering, {{natural rubber}} and steel are used as base isolators for energy dissipation systems to reduce earthquake effect on structures. With laminated natural {{rubber and steel}}, the bearing can provide high vertical stiffness and flexibility in horizontal direction to ensure the mounts can support the loading from the structure and prevent excessive sideways from any horizontal loading especially when earthquake occur. This research performs the study of performance of Public Works Department (PWD) standard bridges under low intensity earthquake effect. The finite element modelling technique {{was used in this}} study to learn the behaviour of rubber bearing with various dimensions and directions of loading (vertical and horizontal). Performances of the rubber bearing were examined based on their stiffness factors. Seismic isolator is designed and it is found that the usage of designed seismic isolator increases the overall performance of the PWD Bridge. In general, this research indicates that the seismic risks should be considered in design the bridge for Malaysian.
