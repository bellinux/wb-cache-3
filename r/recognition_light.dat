The moral discussion, whether it is morally right or wrong to mistreat animals, {{has a long history}} in environmental ethics, longer than any other ethical discussion. Already, Immanuel Kant and St. Thomas Aquinas in the eighteenth century argued that it is morally wrong to harm animals, simultaneously arguing that animals deserve moral <b>recognition</b> (<b>Light</b> and Rolston 2003). Contemporary philosophy ‘Animal Rights View Ethics’ (also known as intentional ethics) points out that each individual (human or animal) has rights that should not be violated, and therefore, ‘living creatures must never be used exclusively as a means to others’ satisfaction’ (Kruger et al. 2012, 133). On the other hand, ‘necessary ethics’ or ‘utilitarian ethics’ emphasises {{that there has to be}} a balance in the sum of individual’s utility/happiness/quality of life, and therefore, animals can be used in industrial production but the animals’ living situation has to be evaluated based on the aforementioned balance also in the industrial production (ibid.). In the code of conduct by the Trade Association Dansk Fashion and Textile is stated following: ‘in businesses where animals are used in labour and/or in the production (fur, wool, etc.), such animals must be fed and treated with dignity and respect and no animal must deliberately be harmed nor exposed to pain in their lifespan’ (Kruger et al. 2012, 135).|$|E

Nature {{provides}} {{a primary source}} of leads {{for the design of}} π-conjugated org. chromophores and other functional mol. systems useful for mol. <b>recognition,</b> <b>light</b> harvesting, photoconversion, and other technol. applications. In this Account, we draw attention to a unique group of naturally occurring heterocyclic compds., the 2 H- 1, 4 -benzothiazines and related benzothiazole derivs. Derived from tyrosine and cysteine, these mols. arise from a mutation-induced deviation of the melanin pathway to provide the core structure of the red human hair pigments pheomelanins. Since the elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of pheomelanins in the 1960 s, researchers have focused on 1, 4 -benzothiazines and red hair pigments. Not only do these mols. have interesting photochem. and mol. recognition properties, they also have compelling biomedical significance. Numerous studies have linked higher levels of pheomelanins and mutations in the pathways that produce these pigments in individuals with red hair and fair skin with an increased sensitivity to UV light and a higher susceptibility to melanoma and other skin cancers. Prompted by new data about the structure and photochem. of the bibenzothiazine system, this Account highlights the chem. of benzothiazines in red-haired individuals as a novel source of inspiration in the quest for innovative scaffolds and biomimetic functional systems. Model studies have gradually shed light on a no. of remarkable phys. and chem. properties of benzothiazine-based systems. Bibenzothiazine is a robust visible chromophore that combines photochromism and acidichromism. Benzothiazine-based polymers (synthetic pheomelanins) show remarkable photochem., paramagnetic, and redox cycling properties. Biomimetic or synthetic manipulations of the benzothiazine systems, through decarboxylation pathways controlled by metal ions or unusually facile ring-contraction processes, can produce a diverse set of mol. scaffolds...|$|E

40|$|A {{potential}} non-lethal {{technique to}} reduce bird-aircraft collisions, aircraft-mounted light, {{has been considered}} for nearly 3 decades, but has received no formal research as to its efficacy. We tested the hypothesis that during daylight hours birds exposed to an approaching vehicle exhibiting pulsing landing lights would react more quickly than birds experiencing an on-coming vehicle with non-pulsing (steady) or no lights (control). We used the PulseliteTM system (Precise Flight, Inc., Bend, Oregon, USA), an early <b>recognition</b> <b>lighting</b> system that allows an aircraft pilot to pulse the landing, taxi, or forward-facing <b>recognition</b> <b>lights,</b> and 2 General Electric sealed-beam 250 -W aircraft landing lights. Using video, we quantified avoidance behavior by captive brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), Canada geese (Branta Canadensis), European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), herring gulls (Larus argentatus), and mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) in separate experiments where captive birds were exposed to a vehicle fitted with the PulseliteTM system, and approaching at a consistent speed (33. 5 m sec- 1). While most species showed no differential response to light treatments, brown-headed cowbird groups (9 groups per treatment, 6 birds per group) responded more quickly to pulse versus control treatments, equating to a greater mean [SE] distance of the approaching vehicle from mid-cage per reacting bird (control: 35. 8 [9. 7] m; pulse: 50. 5 [10. 9] m). However, in a subsequent experiment involving the exposure of brown-headed cowbirds to control, pulse, and steady-light treatments, we observed no statistical difference in response among treatment groups (6 groups per treatment; 6 birds per group). While 250 -W landing lights, pulsed at 45 cycles min- 1, can influence avian behavior {{in response to an}} on-coming vehicle, the effects of the lights are inconsistent.

40|$|AbstractÐHuman face {{detection}} {{plays an}} important role in applications such as video surveillance, human computer interface, face recognition, and face image database management. We propose a face detection algorithm for color images in the presence of varying lighting conditions as well as complex backgrounds. Based on a novel lighting compensation technique and a nonlinear color transformation, our method detects skin regions over the entire image and then generates face candidates based on the spatial arrangement of these skin patches. The algorithm constructs eye, mouth, and boundary maps for verifying each face candidate. Experimental results demonstrate successful face detection over a wide range of facial variations in color, position, scale, orientation, 3 D pose, and expression in images from several photo collections �both indoors and outdoors).

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} face <b>recognition</b> under varying <b>light</b> via 3 D reconstruction {{based on}} the techniques of shape from shading (SFS).

Second, we propose a novel method to investigate human face recognition in the illumination varying case using local topographic information, such as curvedness and shape index extracted from intensity images by SFS algorithms. The experimental results have shown that the curvedness and shape index are suitable for representing 3 D local features, and also it is insensitive to light variations since only 3 D information is involved. Compared with typical face recognition approaches based on principal component analysis (PCA) plus linear discriminant analysis (LDA), the proposed method has demonstrated a better performance.

Reflective noises, shadows and occlusions are detected and corrected by the projection of a facial image onto the canonical eigenface.

40|$|Heterodimeric {{amino acid}} {{transporters}} are comprised of a type-II membrane protein named the heavy chain (4 F 2 hc or rBAT) that may associate {{with a number}} of different polytopic membrane proteins, called light chains. It is thought that the heavy chain is mainly involved in the trafficking of the complex to the plasma membrane, whereas the transport process itself is catalysed by the light chain. The 4 F 2 heavy chain (4 F 2 hc) associates with at least six different light chains to induce distinct amino acid-transport activites. To test if the light chains are specifically recognized and to identify domains involved in the <b>recognition</b> of <b>light</b> chains, C-terminally truncated mutants of 4 F 2 hc were constructed and co-expressed with the light chains LAT 1, LAT 2 and y(+) LAT 2. The truncated isoform T 1, comprised of only 133 amino acids that form the cytosolic N-terminus and the transmembrane helix, displayed only a slight reduction in its ability to promote LAT 1 expression at the membrane surface compared with the 529 amino acid wild-type 4 F 2 hc protein. Co-expression of increasingly larger 4 F 2 hc mutants caused a delayed translocation of LAT 1. In contrast to the weak effects of 4 F 2 hc truncations on LAT 1 expression, surface expression of LAT 2 and y(+) LAT 2 was almost completely lost with all truncated heavy chains. Co-expression of LAT 1 together with the other light chains did not result in displacement of LAT 2 and y(+) LAT 2. The results suggest that extracellular domains of the heavy chain are responsible mainly for <b>recognition</b> of <b>light</b> chains other than LAT 1 and that the extracellular domain ensures proper translocation to the plasma membrane...|$|R
