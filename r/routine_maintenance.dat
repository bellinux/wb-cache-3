5|$|All-electric and plug-in hybrid {{vehicles}} {{also have}} lower maintenance costs {{as compared to}} internal combustion vehicles, since electronic systems break down much less often than the mechanical systems in conventional vehicles, and the fewer mechanical systems on board last longer due to the better use of the electric engine.

5|$|The {{building}} underwent {{some minor}} alterations during its 50 years of {{use by the}} Federal Reserve, consisting mostly of <b>routine</b> <b>maintenance</b> and upgrades. In 1958, the exterior was cleaned and waterproofed at the recommendation of architect William J. Bain, resulting in the discoloring of the limestone cladding. In the 1980s, the building's roof and windows were replaced {{under the direction of}} HNTB. Portions of the building were renovated in the 1990s to add new employee amenities, including a cafeteria and conference room.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Hipper {{left the}} Norwegian theater in September 1940 for an {{overhaul}} in Wilhelmshaven. After the <b>routine</b> <b>maintenance</b> was completed {{toward the end}} of the month, the ship attempted to break out into the Atlantic Ocean to raid merchant traffic. The engine oil feed system caught fire and was severely damaged. The fire forced the crew to shut down the ship's propulsion system until the blaze could be brought under control; this rendered Admiral Hipper motionless for several hours on the open sea. British reconnaissance failed to locate the ship, and after the fire was extinguished, the ship returned to Hamburg's Blohm & Voss shipyard, where repairs lasted slightly over a week.|$|E
5|$|Chicago Landmark is a {{designation}} of the Mayor of Chicago and the Chicago City Council for historic buildings and other sites in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Listed sites are selected after meeting {{a combination of}} criteria, including historical, economic, architectural, artistic, cultural, and social values. Once a site is designated as a landmark, it {{is subject to the}} Chicago Landmarks Ordinance, which requires that any alterations beyond <b>routine</b> <b>maintenance,</b> up to and including demolition, must have their permit reviewed by the Landmarks Commission. Many Chicago Landmarks are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places, providing federal tax support for preservation, and some are further designated National Historic Landmarks, providing additional federal oversight.|$|E

MFM supports proper maintenance on marine engines and generators by using the actual fuel burned or hours operated as the basis for performing <b>maintenance</b> <b>routines.</b> This condition-based <b>maintenance</b> program more accurately reflects the operating environment of the engine, but more importantly, reduces or eliminates unnecessary maintenance work.|$|R
5|$|On 9 June, Wisconsin resumed {{her role}} as a {{training}} ship, taking midshipmen to Greenock, Scotland; Brest, France; and Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, before returning to Norfolk. She departed Hampton Roads on 25 August and participated in the NATO exercise Operation Mainbrace, which was held out of Greenock, Scotland. After her return to Norfolk, Wisconsin underwent an overhaul in the naval shipyard there. Wisconsin remained in the Atlantic fleet throughout 1952 and into 1953, training midshipmen and conducting exercises.

The decision to switch to manual mode came after the cosmonauts noticed a small deviation in the spacecraft's approach to the targeted docking port.

After entering the station the crew stabilized the atmosphere inside Mir and undertook <b>routine</b> <b>maintenance</b> work.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} engine propelling {{the carousel}} was a belt-driven mechanism, {{but after the}} initial restoration it was exchanged for a fluid drive provided by the Kissell Brothers Amusement Rides company of Cincinnati, Ohio, who suggested the platform for the carousel be improved. To provide crowd control, a pavilion was built over the carousel and a ticket booth was installed. Neither was based on any extant buildings, but each was a composite of several other structures. The animals are removed {{one at a time}} from the carousel for <b>routine</b> <b>maintenance</b> and refurbishment, which is carried out in the museum's own shops.|$|E
5|$|The roof is sharply angled {{toward its}} center, where a wooden cupola tops the building. It was {{completed}} after the building, in 1892. At {{each of the}} square shaped building's four corners are dormers, which serve {{to break up the}} monotony of the otherwise ridged roof. The dormers resemble the cupola, in that they are dormered as well as multi-gabled. The roof has had <b>routine</b> <b>maintenance</b> performed as required. The building's dominant feature, its cupola, sits on an oversized brick base with a terra cotta belt around its base top. It features blocked openings with multiple arches, double round arches, Corinthian pilasters, and organic corner detailing.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the festivities in the United States, Seeadler steamed back across the Atlantic to the Azores, before proceeding into the Mediterranean Sea and then into the Red Sea. There, she met Schwalbe at Aden on 20 June. Seeadler proceeded to Bombay, India, for <b>routine</b> <b>maintenance</b> that lasted from 3 July to 21 August. The cruiser finally arrived on station on 2 September when she dropped anchor in Zanzibar and met the survey ship , the other vessel on the East Africa Station. On 9 September both ships went to Kilwa; a group of slave traders had attacked the small police force detachment stationed there. The colonial army, the Schutztruppe (protection force), was unavailable to reinforce the police troops, and so Seeadler and Möwe bombarded the slavers and neutralized the threat.|$|E

5|$|By 1675 the Swedish fleet was numerically {{superior}} to its Danish counterpart (18 ships of the line against 16, 21 frigates against 11), but the Swedish ships were generally older and of poorer quality than the Danish, which had replaced {{a larger proportion of}} its vessels with more modern warships.

Swedish crews lacked the level of professionalism of Danish and Norwegian sailors, who often had experience from service in the Dutch merchant navy, and the Swedish Navy lacked a core of professional officers while the Danish had seasoned veterans like Cort Adeler and Nils Juel. The Danish fleet was reinforced with Dutch units under Philip van Almonde and Cornelis Tromp, the latter an experienced officer who had served under Michiel de Ruyter.|$|E

5|$|Part of {{a larger}} {{conflict}} known as the Halloween War, the fight started after a single player controlling a space station in the star system B-R5RB accidentally failed to make a scheduled in-game <b>routine</b> <b>maintenance</b> payment which made the system (a key staging area used by N3/PL in the war) highly vulnerable to capture. The CFC and Russian coalitions began pouring players into the system in a swift offensive, and N3/PL moved in a large fleet of players as a response as well. A massive battle erupted {{in the system and}} numerous smaller engagements occurred throughout the game universe as players attempted to block reinforcements from joining the battle. CFC/Rus gained a clear win by inflicting heavy losses on N3/PL and successfully capturing B-R5RB. The losses totaled 576 capital ships including 75 Titans (the largest ships available to players), along with thousands of smaller vessels.|$|E
