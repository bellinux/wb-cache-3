40|$|<b>Resoles</b> are resins {{obtained}} by base-catalyzed phenol-formaldehyde condensation with a three-dimensional cross-linked framework. They are considered as highly chemical-resistant, and calcination is thus generally {{used in the}} treatment of resole-type resins, which significantly limits the diversity of nanostructured materials that can be derived from resole-type resins. Herein, we report that selected metal nitrate solutions can be used to dissolve various types of nanostructured <b>resoles</b> through an oxidative dissolution process. This strategy not only enables the controlled dissolution of <b>resoles,</b> but more importantly provides a new approach to selectively etch resole-based nanocomposites to give rise to a variety of nanostructured materials with unprecedented architectures and great potential in bioapplications...|$|R

50|$|Tego {{film was}} {{developed}} in Germany around 1930 as a glue for waterproof plywood. It comprised a paper sheet pre-impregnated with a <b>resole</b> phenolic resin. When heated, assembled between wood veneers and then compressed, a strong and waterproof laminated plywood was formed. Most plywood at this time used other adhesives, such as casein. These adhesives were generally applied as aqueous solutions, which caused warping of thin veneers and {{made it difficult to}} achieve a solid laminate without risk of voids. As Tego film was used dry, it gave a high integrity result, solid and without risk of hidden weaknesses. This became an important factor in time, when it was applied to use in aircraft construction.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} {{bio-based}} bio-phenol-formaldehyde (BPF) <b>resoles</b> were prepared using hydrolytically depolymerized Kraft lignin (DKL) as bio-phenol to partially substitute phenol. The effects of phenol substitution ratio, weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of DKL and formaldehyde-to-phenol (F/P) ratio {{were also investigated}} to find the optimum curing temperature for BPF <b>resoles.</b> The results indicated that DKL with Mw ~ 1200 g/mol provides a curing temperature of less than 180 °C for any substitution level, provided that F/P ratios are controlled. Incorporation of lignin reduced the curing temperature of the resin, however, higher Mw DKL negatively affected the curing process. For any level of lignin Mw, the curing temperature was found to increase with lower F/P ratios at lower phenol substitution levels. At 25 % and 50 % phenol substitution, increasing the F/P ratio allows for synthesis of <b>resoles</b> with lower curing temperatures. Increasing the phenol substitution from 50 % to 75 % allows for {{a broader range of}} lignin Mw to attain low curing temperatures...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{new insights}} in the <b>resole</b> crosslinking chemistry of thermoplastic vulcanisates (TPVs) {{and in the}} production of TPVs on extruders. Low-molecular-weight olefins were used in combination with EPDM crosslinking experiments to investigate the <b>resole</b> crosslinking chemistry.

40|$|High ortho <b>resole</b> resin was {{prepared}} by condensation of phenol with excess of formaldehyde {{in the presence}} of magnesium oxide as catalyst. Reaction of furfuraldehyde with acetone in basic medium led to difurfurylidene acetone (DFA). Their interpenetrating polymer network (IPNS) were obtained by the reaction of predetermined quantities of difurfurylidene acetone and high ortho <b>resole</b> using p-toluene sulphonic acid (PTSA) as curing agent. The thermal behavior of the resins was studied using thermogravimetry (TG) under ambient and nitrogen atmospheres over a temperature range of (25 - 1000 C º). It was observed that the IPN of 20 % DFA – 80 % <b>resole</b> has higher thermal stability than that of <b>resole</b> alone and the decomposition temperature was higher by 80 C º.

40|$|A {{comparative}} study {{was made in}} order to evaluate the interfacial characteristics of treated aramid fibres and epoxy resins. Surface treatment by coating with phenolic resins was performed using the following two systems: a) alkaline aqueous solution of <b>resole</b> resin and b) solution of novolac resin containing hexamethylene-tetramine as cross-linking agent. After these treatments, the modified aramid fibres {{were used for the}} preparation of reinforced epoxy specimens. The flexural properties of these specimens were determined and the results were discussed taking into consideration the surface characteristics of the modified fibres, as derived from pull-out tests and contact angle measurements. It was shown that both coatings are adequate to promote interfacial adhesive bonding to epoxy matrices due to the chemical reactivity of phenolic resins to the epoxy matrix as well as to their affinity with the aramid fibre surface. <b>Resole</b> appeared more efficient than novolac as it produces uniform continuous films, shows increased reactivity due to its higher hydroxyl content and can be easily processed because it is soluble in alkaline water solutions...|$|E

The modified {{phenolic resins}} were prepared at various mole ratios of phenol to cardanol and the polymerization was carried out under basic conditions. In the synthesis a maximum content of 40 % of Cardanol in the resin was possible to obtain, as a higher Cardanol content resulted in the formation of a resin with an extremely high viscosity. The effect of replacement of phenol by Cardanol on the thermal and mechanical properties of <b>resole</b> resins was experimentally investigated. An increases in the content of Cardanol resulted in a proportional increases in flexibility and the fracture toughness together with a decreases in the flexural modulus of the cured resins. The higher toughening effect of replacing phenol with Cardanol was obtained with the total Phenol:Formaldehyde ratio of 1. 0 : 1. 25 in the synthesis of the resin.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{addressed}} the blending and cocuring of <b>resole</b> and epoxy, using NaOH and 4, 49 -diaminodiphenylmethane as curing agents. IR band shifts regarding the molecular interactions were investigated with FTIR. Exothermic peak shifts during cocur-ing reactions were studied with dynamic DSC. Viscosity increases were {{measured with a}} Brookfield LVT viscometer at 100 °C. The dynamic mechanical properties of the cocured samples were investigated using rheometric dynamic spectroscopy (RDS). Experimental results revealed that the molecular interactions between <b>resole</b> and epoxy resulted in good compatibility {{as shown by the}} single damping peak in the RDS curve and the single glass transition for each cocured sample. Also apparent were accelerated curing rates, leading to shifts of the exothermic peaks to lower temperature and faster viscosity increases. Never-theless, enhanced gel fractions and increased glass-transition temperatures (Tg) of the samples were generally observed for this cocured system. The average molecular weight between crosslinked points calculated for the cocured materials also showed much less than the two components.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{co-curing}} blends of an unsaturated polyester (UP) with inherently fire-retardant and char-forming phenolic resoles (PH) on the thermal stability and fire retardancy {{of the resulting}} resins have been investigated. To overcome the challenge of UP/PH incompatibility, arising from their different chemical structures and curing mechanisms (radical vs. condensation), different phenolic resoles have been used: ethanol-soluble, epoxy-functionalized, and allyl-functionalized. A traditional water-based <b>resole</b> has also been used to give a reference non-compatible system. In Part 1 of this series of publications it was shown that the compatibility of the two resins increases with functionalization; the allyl-functionalized <b>resole</b> showing the best compatibility with UP. Limiting oxygen index measurements and cone calorimetry have shown that fire performance of the functionalized PH resins and their blends with UP is worse than that from the unfunctionalized PH resin, but still significantly better {{than that of the}} UP. To understand this behaviour, thermal analyses coupled with infrared spectroscopy of volatile degradation products have been used on all resins and their blends, based on which, mechanisms of their decomposition and interactions are proposed, and the effects of these on flammability are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} probe the {{formation}} of sulfur- and nitrogen-containing gases during the pyrolysis and combustion of coals and other solid fuels, non-softening model substrates are required. In this respect, phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resins are ideal since they readily facilitate the incorporation of individual heteroatomic functions into a highly crosslinked matrix. A series of sulfur- and nitrogen-containing co-resites have been prepared using phenol with, as the second component, thiophene, dibenzothiophene, diphenylsulfide, benzyl phenyl sulfide, thioanisole, 8 -hydroxyquinoline and 2 -hydroxycarbazole. A mole ratio of 3 : 1 (phenol: heteroatom-containing component) was adopted {{in order to ensure}} that a reasonably high degree of crosslinking was achieved. <b>Resoles</b> containing diphenyldisulfide were also prepared but, due to the comparable bond strengths of the S-S and C-O linkages, a curing temperature of only 130 degrees C was used to avoid cleavage of the disulfide bond. The virtually complete elimination of ether and methylol functions from the <b>resoles</b> by curing at 200 degrees C was monitored by solid-state C- 13 nuclear magnetic resonance (n. m. r.) spectroscopy. The resultant resites were also characterized by sulfur K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES.) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (X. p. s.) and differential scanning calorimetry (d. s. c.). Simple air oxidation was found to selectively convert the aliphatic-bound sulfur to a mixture of sulfones and sulfoxides. Applications of the resites in fuel science are described...|$|R
