2500|$|As Director General, Birt was {{tasked with}} {{securing}} the BBC’s future {{at a time}} of rapid technical, cultural and economic changes in world broadcasting. [...] In seven years, Birt restructured and modernised the corporation which he wanted to make [...] "the best managed public sector organisation". [...] Birt imposed a policy of radical change to deliver efficiency savings. In April 1993 he introduced Producer Choice, giving programme makers the power to buy services from outside the BBC. This theoretically reduced the cost to licence-payers of the BBC's historic resource base. Faced with high rental fees from the BBC's <b>record</b> <b>library,</b> producers found it cheaper to buy records from local record shops. In-house facilities were closed or stood idle, allegedly as a result of Birt's [...] "creative accounting" [...] methods.|$|E

2500|$|His initial {{assignment}} {{was to create}} a children's <b>record</b> <b>library</b> for the four-year-old company, for which he created the [...] "Bozo the Clown" [...] character. He wrote and produced a popular series of storytelling record-album and illustrative read-along book sets beginning with the October 1946 release of [...] "Bozo at the Circus." [...] His record-reader concept, which enabled children to read and follow a story in pictures while listening to it, was the first of its kind. The Bozo image was a composite design of Livingston's, derived from a variety of clown pictures and given to an artist to turn into comic-book-like illustrations. Livingston then hired Pinto Colvig to portray Bozo on the recordings. Colvig, a former circus clown, was also the original voice of Walt Disney's Pluto, Goofy, Grumpy, Sleepy and many other characters. Billy May produced the music. The series {{turned out to be a}} smash hit for Capitol, selling over eight million albums in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Successful record sales led to a variety of Bozo-related merchandise and the first television series, [...] "Bozo's Circus," [...] starring Pinto Colvig on KTTV-Channel 11 (CBS) in Los Angeles in 1949. The character also became a mascot for the record company and was later nicknamed [...] "Bozo the Capitol Clown." ...|$|E
