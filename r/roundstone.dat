25|$|In February 2009, Kevin Rennie, a {{columnist}} at the Hartford Courant, ran an op-ed concerning Dodd's acquisition of his vacation home in <b>Roundstone,</b> Ireland.|$|E
2500|$|The article {{alleged that}} Dodd's former partner in buying the home had ties to disgraced Bear Stearns {{principal}} Edward Downe, Jr. {{who has since}} been convicted of insider trading by the Securities and Exchange Commission. After paying an $11 million fine {{for his role in}} the scam, Downe later obtained a pardon in the waning days of the Bill Clinton administration. The controversial pardon was granted after Dodd lobbied Clinton on Downe's behalf. Dodd's letter to the President said, [...] "Mr. President, Ed Downe is a good person, who is truly sorry for the hurt he caused others". After Downe's pardon, Dodd bought out the interests of his partner for a price allegedly based on a 2002 bank appraisal of the <b>Roundstone</b> home, which yielded little profit for Dodd's partner. Rennie criticized Dodd for claiming the <b>Roundstone</b> home was worth less than $250,000 in Senate ethics filings; some observers estimated the likely value in excess of $1 million USD.|$|E

Walking on that very Urrisbeg Mountain under whose shadow I heard Ottilia's name, Mackay, the learned author of the [...] "Flora Patlandica," [...] discovered the Mediterranean heath,--such a flower as I have often plucked on the sides of Vesuvius, and as Proserpine, no doubt, amused herself in gathering as she strayed in the fields of Enna. Here it is--the self-same flower, peering out at the Atlantic from <b>Roundstone</b> Bay; here, too, in this wild lonely place, nestles the fragrant memory of my Ottilia! ...|$|E
