50|$|The most {{commonly}} found six Lambrusco varieties are Lambrusco Grasparossa, Lambrusco Maestri, Lambrusco Marani, Lambrusco Montericco, Lambrusco Salamino, and Lambrusco Sorbara. All of these various Lambrusco grapes are indigenous to Emilia and neither clones nor sub-clones. Most Lambruscos {{are made from}} more than one Lambrusco variety and additionally often blended with a number of specific blending grapes (max. 15%), such as Ancellotta (for color), Marzemino, Malbo Gentile, Cabernet Sauvignon (for body and structure), and others. The grape vines are often trained high above the ground to prevent the development of mildew. Historically the vines were trained to climb up poplar trees. The grape itself is not particularly sweet but many of the commercial Lambrusco versions are sweetened by either partial fermentation or with the addition of <b>rectified</b> <b>concentrated</b> grape <b>must.</b> When not fermented sweet, the Lambrusco grape is capable of producing an excellent dry wine with strawberry notes and a slight bitter finish.|$|R

50|$|Most wine laws require {{temperatures}} below at most −7 °C (19 °F) {{before the}} grapes for ice wine can be picked, At such temperatures, {{some of the}} water in the grapes freezes out, but the sugars and other solids remain dissolved in the remaining juice. If the grapes are pressed whilst frozen, a very <b>concentrated</b> <b>must</b> can result, which needs special yeast and a long time to ferment. The resulting wines are very sweet, but with lots of balancing acidity. The minuscule yields mean they tend to be very expensive. The most famous ice wines are German Eiswein and Canadian Icewine, but apart from these, ice wine is also made in the United States, Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Italy, Australia, France and New Zealand in smaller quantities.|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of processing temperature on the evolution of volatiles during grape must concentration upon cooking. The evolution of the volatiles fingerprint of grape must heated at 80, 90, and 100 °C was studied by Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS). The intensity of the heat treatment influenced the volatile molecules generated after the activation of the non enzymatic browning (NEB) reactions during the cooking process. These volatile compounds represent the most important molecules that characterise the aroma of highly cooked and <b>concentrated</b> <b>must.</b> Time and temperature of treatment influenced dramatically the evolution of must volatile compounds, so at the end of the treatment different volatile profiles were observed. Concentration being equal, high temperature-short time treatments limited the accumulation of volatiles associated to NEB while prolonged times of treatment favoured the formation of NEB flavour...|$|R

Namakwa Sands {{is a heavy}} mineral {{mining and}} {{beneficiation}} business within Tronox, and produces two major products, zircon (zr 02. Si 02 99. 9 %) and rutile (Ti 02 99. 9 %) at a combined annual rate of 140 kt. The heavy mineral concentrates are exported to international markets to make specialist coatings for the paints and ceramics industries. The ceramic industry is very strict on {{the purity of the}} minerals used. Namakwa Sands prides itself in being able to produce zircon and rutile at these requirements; however, strict requirements, especially in terms of Fe impurities (Fe 203 content in zircon <b>concentrate</b> <b>must</b> be < 600 ppm), limit the productivity and come at a cost to recovery. The concentration and separation of heavy minerals is a complex process, which utilizes conductivity differences between minerals. Zircon coated with iron oxides (Fe 203, FeOOH) reports as more conductive during electrostatic separation, which can result in a zircon particle to behave like a rutile particle and in this way cause both products (rutile and zircon) to become off specification...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{communication}} is to show {{the advantages of the}} use of wine alcohol as a preservative of must and its recovery through a system of evapo-destillation of reverse flow. Currently, the industry uses sulfur dioxide in the conservation of musts destined for concentration. The problem about the use of sulfur dioxide in the conservation of musts is that not ensure an anti-fermentative stability whole, but mainly in that it is not recovered, thereby producing a consequent pollution. Moreover <b>concentrated</b> <b>musts</b> usually contain a small presence of ethanol from micro-fermentations. At laboratory scale it was verified an excellent state of preservation of alcoholizated must, and all the alcohol used was recovered by distillation. The proposed system achieved a high reduction of production costs which is demonstrated by simulation process software, where it can show the energy savings compared to the conventional process for the same volume and concentration of product obtained. Another important advantage of this system is that higher alcohols and flavors would not be lost because is not necessary a desulfitation process, thus obtaining better quality products...|$|R

40|$|Pulsed {{electric}} fields (PEF) is {{a promising}} technology for promoting {{the extraction of}} compounds from grape berries, during skin maceration. PEF promotes the electrically-induced formation of pores in the cell membranes, facilitating the migration of anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins and total phenolics in the juice, in an even more efficient way respect to pectolytic enzymes. The intensity of the treatment affects the final results. PEF processing of crushed grapes showed no effects {{on the behavior of}} alcoholic fermentation, as well as on juice and wine basic quality control parameters, {{with the exception of a}} slight increase of juice pH, which basically disappeared in the final wines. Wines processed by PEF were generally perceived as more colored and full-bodied. The latter characteristic might be connected with a higher HCl and ethanol index, reflecting a more favorable composition of tannins in PEF treated samples. When PEF treatment is carried out after crushingdestemming, the maximum color extraction observed during maceration was achieved immediately after the treatment; this makes PEF technology particularly useful for reducing the processing time, allowing its application in several situations, such as the vinification of low-ripe grapes, grapes affected by molds, or the production of <b>concentrated</b> <b>musts</b> from red grape varieties...|$|R

40|$|Ease of dosing and {{simplicity}} of monitoring make new oral anticoagulants an attractive therapy {{in a growing}} range of clinical conditions. However, newer oral anticoagulants interact with the coagulation cascade in different ways than traditional warfarin therapy. Replacement of clotting factors will not reverse the effects of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban. Currently, antidotes for these drugs are not widely available. Fortunately, withholding the anticoagulant and dialysis are freqnently effective treatments, particularly with rivaroxaban and dabigatran. Emergent bleeding, however, requires utilization of Prothrombin Complex Concentrates (PCCs). PCCs, in addition to recombinant factor VIIa, are used to activate the clotting system to reverse {{the effects of the}} new oral anticoagulants. In cases of refractory or emergent bleeding, the recommended factor concentrate in our protocols differs between the new oral anticoagulants. In patients taking dabigatran, we administer an activated PCC (aPCC) [FELBA] due to reported benefit in human in vitro studies. Based on human clinical trial evidence, the 4 -factor PCC (Kcentra) is suggested for patients with refractory rivaroxaban- or apixaban-associated hemorrhage. If bleeding continues, recombinant factor VIIa may be employed. With all of these new procoagulant agents, the risk of thrombosis associated with administration of factor <b>concentrates</b> <b>must</b> be weighed against the relative risk of hemorrhage...|$|R
