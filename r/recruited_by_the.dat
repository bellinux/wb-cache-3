5|$|According to this view, {{the barbarian}} {{officers}} and men <b>recruited</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> late army, coming from tribes that were traditional enemies of Rome, {{had no real}} loyalty to Rome and often betrayed her interests, colluding with invading barbarian tribes, especially if those tribes were their own.

Ultimately, the army degenerated into just a collection of foreign mercenary bands that were incapable of defending the empire effectively.|$|E
