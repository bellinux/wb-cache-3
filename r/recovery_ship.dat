In this paper, a Fuzzy c means method is used to determine groups of terminals so that professional oil <b>recovery</b> <b>ships</b> can be allocated to optimally serve terminals within a group. The application of the method has been illustrated using Zhoushan Port Area as an example, and optimal {{allocation of}} professional oil <b>recovery</b> <b>ships</b> in Zhoushan port area was proposed...|$|R

25|$|To {{determine}} {{the feasibility of}} this system, several tests were performed on full-sized Redstones, including water impact and flotation tests, and an exercise at sea in which a floating Redstone {{was picked up by}} a Navy <b>recovery</b> <b>ship.</b> All these tests showed recovery of the rocket to be workable. Further development was halted, however, due to lack of funding, so the parachute system was not tested.|$|E
25|$|Decommissioned {{shortly after}} the end of the war, she was modernized and recommissioned in the early 1950s as an attack carrier (CVA), and then {{eventually}} became an antisubmarine carrier (CVS). She was recommissioned too late to participate in the Korean War but served for many years in the Pacific, including duty in the Vietnam War, in which she earned five battle stars. Late in her career, she served as a <b>recovery</b> <b>ship</b> for the Apollo 8 space mission, and was used in the movie Tora! Tora! Tora! which recreated the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor; and in the science fiction film The Philadelphia Experiment.|$|E
25|$|The real Jim Lovell {{appears as}} {{captain of the}} <b>recovery</b> <b>ship</b> USS Iwo Jima; Howard had {{intended}} to make him an admiral, but Lovell himself, having retired as a captain, chose to appear in his actual rank. Horror film director Roger Corman, a mentor of Howard, appears as a congressman being given a VIP tour by Lovell of the Vehicle Assembly Building, as it had {{become something of a}} tradition for Corman to make a cameo appearance in his protégés' films. The real Marilyn Lovell appeared among the spectators during the launch sequence. CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite appears in archive news footage and can be heard in newly recorded announcements, some of which he edited himself to sound more authentic.|$|E

25|$|The real Mission Control Center {{consisted}} of two control rooms located on {{the second and third}} floors of Building 30 at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. NASA offered the use of the control room for filming, but Howard declined, opting instead to make his own replica from scratch. Production designer Michael Corenblith and set decorator Merideth Boswell were in charge of the construction of the Mission Control set at Universal Studios. The set was equipped with giant rear-screen projection capabilities and a complex set of computers with individual video feeds to all the flight controller stations. The actors playing the flight controllers were able {{to communicate with each other}} on a private audio loop. The Mission Control room built for the film was on the ground floor. One NASA employee, who was a consultant for the film, said that the set was so realistic that he would leave at the end of the day and look for the elevator before remembering he was not in Mission Control. By the time the film was made, the USS Iwo Jima had been scrapped, so her sister ship, the USS New Orleans, was used as the <b>recovery</b> <b>ship</b> instead.|$|E

50|$|Following {{the loss}} of the Space Shuttle Challenger in 1986, NR-1 was used to search for, identify, and recover {{critical}} parts of the Challenger craft.

50|$|Many {{petroleum}} compounds {{have limited}} solubility in water. Low solubility is typically of negligible concern {{with respect to}} product loss, but toxic petroleum products may be regarded as pollution in the water displaced as a tank is loaded with petroleum.

Repeating that support with Faith 7 in 1963, she shifted to combat operations in October 1964 and deployed to the South China Sea to refuel ships employ {{the coast of}} Vietnam. After 279 refuelings, she returned to Hawaiian waters. In June 1965 she participated in recovery operations for Gemini 4, then deployed again to Vietnam. In December she interrupted operations there to support the <b>recovery</b> <b>ships</b> for Gemini 6 and Gemini 7 and in April 1966 returned to Hawaii after having set a new record in the Pacific Fleet by bringing 503 ships alongside, 464 of which she refueled. Deployed to WestPac again in November 1967, she pumped over [...] of fuel through her hoses before returning home in June 1968. In October she again joined ships in the Pacific splashdown area, this time to recover Apollo 7, the first U.S. three-man flight.|$|R
5000|$|The Bottsand-class oil <b>recovery</b> <b>ships</b> (Type 738) of the German Navy are {{intended}} for seawater pollution control. The twin hull ships feature a bow which can be opened by 65 degrees. This creates an area of more than 40 m2 to collect oil-polluted seawater.

2500|$|The {{destroyer}} quickly {{settled into}} the by now familiar cycle of training and upkeep. The only break came in {{the second week of}} November, when she served as an alternate <b>recovery</b> <b>ship</b> during the Apollo 4 unmanned capsule flight test. Unfortunately, the crash and loss of a DASH drone marred an otherwise uneventful mission. Misfortune dogged Carpenter when another drone crashed on 10 January 1968. Despite those mishaps, however, the ship passed all her inspections early in the year and resumed local operations in March. Departing Pearl Harbor on 29 March, the destroyer proceeded north of Midway on a secondary recovery station for another unmanned capsule flight. On 4 April, Carpenters radar tracked the Apollo 6 capsule as it passed nearly overhead on a trajectory to a safe splash down near [...]|$|E
2500|$|USS Intrepid (CV/CVA/CVS-11), {{also known}} as The Fighting [...] "I", is one of 24 s built during World War II for the United States Navy. She is the fourth US Navy ship to bear the name.

Decommissioned shortly {{after the end of}} the war, she was modernized and recommissioned in the early 1950s as an attack carrier (CVA), and then {{eventually}} became an antisubmarine carrier (CVS). In her second career, she served mainly in the Atlantic, but also participated in the Vietnam War. Her notable achievements include being the <b>recovery</b> <b>ship</b> for a Mercury and a Gemini space mission. Because of her prominent role in battle, she was nicknamed [...] "the FightingI", while her frequent bad luck and time spent in dry dock for repairs—she was torpedoed once and hit by four separate Japanese kamikaze aircraft—earned her the nicknames [...] "Decrepit" [...] and [...] "the DryI".

50|$|The USS McMorris was {{shadowing}} the Soviet <b>recovery</b> <b>ships,</b> collecting intelligence information. Photographs {{taken by}} the McMorris of the descent module bobbing in the ocean aroused concern at NASA that the Soviets were planning a manned circumlunar flight soon, especially since the United States had been tracking Zond 5 for its entire flight, and was a catalyst for the decision to launch Apollo 8 to the Moon in December instead of its originally planned mission of testing the lunar module in high Earth orbit.|$|R
50|$|The {{successful}} use of {{the carriers}} as <b>recovery</b> <b>ships</b> continued into the Apollo program. On 26 February 1966, Boxer recovered the command module from AS-201, the first unmanned flight of a production Apollo Command and Service Module. AS-202, another sub-orbital test flight of the command module, was recovered in August by Hornet; the command module from that flight is currently on display aboard Hornet. Bennington recovered the command module of Apollo 4, the first unmanned flight of the Saturn V launch vehicle, on 9 November 1967.|$|R
