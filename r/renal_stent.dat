40|$|ObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze {{immediate}} and long-term renal outcomes (renal function and renal events) after fenestrated (FEVAR) and branched endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (BEVAR). MethodsAll FEVAR and BEVAR performed between October 2004 and October 2012 were included in this study. Post-operative acute renal failure (ARF) was defined according to the RIFLE criteria. Renal volume (calculated with a 3 D workstation) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (estimated with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] formula) were evaluated before the procedure, before discharge, 12 months after, and yearly thereafter. <b>Renal</b> <b>stent</b> occlusion, dissection, fracture, stenosis, kink, <b>renal</b> <b>stent</b> related endoleak, and <b>renal</b> <b>stent</b> secondary intervention were all considered “renal composite events” and analyzed. A time to event analysis was performed for renal events and secondary renal interventions. Results 225 patients were treated with FEVAR and BEVAR. Renal target vessels (n =  427) were perfused by fenestrations (n =  374), or branches (n =  53). Median follow up was 3. 1 years (2. 9 – 3. 3 years). Technical success was achieved in 95. 5 % of patients. Post-operative ARF was seen in 64 patients (29 %). Mean total renal volume and eGFR at 1 year, 2 year, and 3 year follow up were significantly lower when compared with pre-operative levels (after BEVAR and FEVAR); the decrease at 3 years was 14. 8 % (6. 7 %; 22. 2 %) (p = . 0006) for total renal volume and 14. 3 % (3. 1 %; 24. 3 %) (p = . 02) for eGFR. The 30 day and 5 year freedom from renal composite event was 98. 6 % (95. 8 – 99. 6 %) and 84. 5 % (76. 5 – 89. 9 %) after FEVAR and BEVAR (NS). The 30 day and 5 year freedom from renal occlusion was 99. 5 % (96. 7 – 99. 9 %) and 94. 4 % (89. 3 – 97. 1 %) after FEVAR and BEVAR (NS). ConclusionFEVAR and BEVAR are durable options for the treatment of complex aortic aneurysms and are associated with low renal morbidity, without differences between devices types. The clinical impact of decreasing renal volume over time in these patients is yet to be fully understood...|$|E

40|$|There {{is little}} debate that an {{untreated}} significant obstruction of {{blood flow to}} the kidney, most often due to atherosclerosis, is potentially hazardous to the health of patients.

The current debate is on the question of which patients are offered any additional advantage by revascularization for renal artery stenosis over medications alone.

40|$|ObjectivePatients {{undergoing}} {{repair of}} thoracoabdominal (TAA) or visceral aortic segment aneurysms typically require {{reconstruction of the}} renal arteries. The use of balloon expandable stents (BES) has been proposed {{as an alternative to}} endarterectomy or bypass for renal artery reconstruction (RAR) during open aortic aneurysm repair. We report technical aspects and long-term patency data for this method of right RAR during complex open aortic aneurysm repair. MethodsDuring the interval July 1, 2005 to December 31, 2007, a total of 67 patients underwent right RAR using a BES during concomitant TAA (type I: n = 2 [2. 9 %], type II: n = 8 [11. 9 %], type III: n = 13 [19. 4 %], and type IV: n = 22 [32. 8 %]), juxtarenal (n = 9 [13. 4 %]) or suprarenal (n = 13 [19. 4 %]) AAA repair. Indications for RAR were orificial stenosis (n = 21 [31 %]) and/or technical considerations referable to the proximal aortic suture line. Patency of the <b>renal</b> <b>stent</b> was evaluated in patients with computed tomography angiography using three-dimensional reconstruction or with abdominal duplex evaluation at follow-up. ResultsThe mean patient age was 75. 1 years, 54. 4 % were male, and 18 % of operations were in nonelective circumstances. Twenty-seven (39 %) out of 67 patients had a preoperative creatinine level ≥ 1. 4 mg/dL. Two patients (2. 9 %) developed permanent renal failure postoperatively (neither related to renal artery occlusion). Mean radiologic follow-up was 405 days (11 - 1281) with 98 % stent patency noted. One patient had an early stent occlusion noted at 1 month. An additional patient was noted to have a nonflow-limiting dissection distal to the <b>renal</b> <b>stent,</b> and another was noted to have distal migration of the stent beyond the renal ostium; however, these findings were clinically silent.

40|$|Purpose: To {{quantify}} the hemodynamic {{impact of a}} flared <b>renal</b> <b>stent</b> {{on the performance of}} fenestrated stent-grafts (FSGs) by analyzing flow patterns and wall shear stress–derived parameters in flared and nonflared FSGs in different physiologic scenarios. Methods: Hypothetical models of FSGs were created with and without flaring of the proximal portion of the <b>renal</b> <b>stent.</b> Flared FSGs with different dilation angles and protrusion lengths were examined, as well as a nonplanar flared FSG to account for lumbar curvature. Laminar and pulsatile blood flow was simulated by numerically solving Navier-Stokes equations. A physiologically realistic flow rate waveform was prescribed at the inlet, while downstream vasculature was modeled using a lumped parameter 3 -element windkessel model. No slip boundary conditions were imposed at the FSG walls, which were assumed to be rigid. While resting simulations were performed on all the FSGs, exercise simulations were also performed on a flared FSG to {{quantify the}} effect of flaring in different physiologic scenarios. Results: For cycle-averaged inflow of 2. 94 L/min (rest) and 4. 63 L/min (exercise), 27 % of blood flow was channeled into each renal branch at rest and 21 % under exercise for all the flared FSGs examined. Although the renal flow waveform was not affected by flaring, flow within the flared FSGs was disturbed. This flow disturbance led to high endothelial cell activation potential (ECAP) values at the renal ostia for all the flared geometries. Reducing the dilation angle or protrusion length and exercise lowered the ECAP values for flared FSGs. Conclusion: Flaring of renal stents has a negligible effect on the time dependence of renal flow rate waveforms and can maintain sufficient renal perfusion at rest and exercise. Local flow patterns are, however, strongly dependent on renal flaring, which creates a local flow disturbance and may increase the thrombogenicity at the renal ostia. Smaller dilation angles, shorter protrusion lengths, and moderate lower limb exercise are likely {{to reduce the risk of}} thrombosis in flared geometries...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the outcome of adjunctive renal artery stenting for renal artery coverage at the time of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). MethodsBetween August 2000 and August 2008, 29 patients underwent elective EVAR using bifurcated Zenith stent grafts (Cook, Indianapolis, Ind) and simultaneous renal artery stenting. Renal artery stenting during EVAR was performed with endograft “encroachment” on the renal artery ostium (n = 23) or placement of a <b>renal</b> <b>stent</b> parallel to {{the main body of the}} endograft (“snorkel,” n = 8). Follow-up included routine contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), multiview abdominal radiographs, and serum creatinine measurement at 1, 6, and 12 months, and then yearly thereafter. ResultsThirty-one renal arteries were stented successfully in 29 patients. The 18 patients with planned renal artery stent placement had a proximal neck length 1 month postoperatively) or stent graft migrations. ConclusionsAdjunctive renal artery stenting during endovascular AAA repair using the “encroachment” and “snorkel” techniques is safe and effective.

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the validity of estimates of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for assessing serial changes in renal function after <b>renal</b> artery <b>stenting.</b> BackgroundeGFR are unreliable for assessing serial renal function in patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS). eGFR have not been validated for assessment of serial renal function after <b>renal</b> artery <b>stenting.</b> MethodsSerum creatinine (SCr) and 125 I-iothalamate GFR (iGFR) were measured in RAS patients before and after <b>renal</b> artery <b>stenting.</b> eGFR were calculated from Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI), and Cockcroft-Gault (CG) formulas. Using iGFR as the reference standard, the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) were determined for MDRD, CKD-EPI, and CG for assessing changes in GFR before and after intervention. ResultsBetween 1998 and 2007, 84 patients underwent iGFR and eGFR before and after <b>renal</b> artery <b>stenting.</b> All eGFR demonstrated poor sensitivity and reliability for detecting ≥ 20 % changes in iGFR, and poor agreement in the magnitude and direction of change in iGFR, before and after <b>renal</b> <b>stenting.</b> ConclusionsIn RAS patients, eGFR demonstrate poor sensitivity and reliability for detecting meaningful changes in iGFR after <b>renal</b> artery <b>stenting.</b> eGFR should be abandoned as primary endpoints in major clinical trials assessing the impact of renal revascularization on renal function...|$|R

This prospective, observational study investigates the outcomes of <b>renal</b> <b>stenting</b> in patients with RHTN and hemodynamically significant ARAS. Methods: Fifty-four patients with RHTN were selected because of angiographic evidence of ARAS &#x 3 e; 70 % and were followed for 4 years after <b>renal</b> <b>stenting.</b> <b>Renal</b> function and echocardiographic variables were assessed at baseline and during follow-up. Results: Blood pressure decreased rapidly after <b>renal</b> <b>stenting</b> and was normalized in 67 % of patients at six months, with significant {{reduction in the number}} of antihypertensive drugs. Creatinine clearance increased in 39 % of patients, decreased in 52 %, and remained stable in the remaining 9 %, with an average value that had a nonsignificant decrease during follow-up.

All patients {{with evidence of}} renal artery pathology including duplex scan assessed peak systolic velocity (PSV) 200 cm/s, renal aortic ratio (RAR) > 3. 5, elevation of the serum creatinine > 30 %, computed tomography (CT) evidence of renal stenosis underwent further analyses including medical chart review, and a review of CT and duplex scan imaging data. Correlations of ultrasound scan, CT, angiographic, and clinical outcomes were conducted and receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis was performed.

ResultsA total of 518 renal arteries were treated with uncovered or covered <b>renal</b> <b>stents</b> (287 patients). Mean follow-up was 25 months. The estimated freedom from stenosis at 12, 24, and 36 months were 95 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 93 - 98), 92 % (89 - 96), and 89 % (85 - 93) for uncovered stents, and 98 % (96 - 100), 97 % (95 - 100), and 95 % (91 - 100) for covered stents (log rank P =. 04). Secondary interventions were performed in 20 % of the patients who developed stenoses. Only one of the detected stenoses that was not treated with a secondary intervention progressed to occlusion.

40|$|BackgroundRenal artery stent {{placement}} is {{a recognized}} treatment {{for patients with}} hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis when medical therapy fails. Duplex ultrasound (DUS) is the primary method used for noninvasive assessment of renal artery patency. Arterial stents alter the compliance of the artery, which could make the standard reference values, based on native renal artery velocities, inaccurate. This study attempted to determine DUS criteria for renal artery in-stent restenosis (ISR). MethodsWe studied 67 consecutive patients with suspected renal artery ISR based on abnormal renal DUS results, defined as peak systolic velocity (PSV) ≥ 200 cm/s and renal/aortic velocity ratio (RAR) ≥ 3. 5. The ISR patients were compared with 55 consecutive nonstented patients who underwent renal DUS evaluation and renal angiography. Those with ≥ 50 % angiographic narrowing in each group were analyzed, and renal PSV and RAR were compared. ResultsIn the 67 patients with <b>renal</b> <b>stents</b> and 55 patients without <b>renal</b> <b>stents,</b> a statistically significant correlation was found for both PSV and RAR in detecting renal ISR and renal artery stenosis as defined by quantitative angiography (P =. 02). For any level of angiographic stenosis ≥ 50 %, the ISR group had relatively higher PSV and RAR compared with the nonstented group. Receiver operating characteristic curves indicated that PSV ≥ 395 cm/s or RAR ≥ 5. 1 were the most predictive of angiographically significant ISR ≥ 70 %. ConclusionThe current DUS criteria for native renal arteries may overestimate the degree of angiographic ISR due to changes in compliance. We recommend that DUS laboratories make adjustments in PSV and RAR obtained by DUS when monitoring the patency of <b>renal</b> <b>stents</b> for ISR...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: To {{evaluate}} the technical {{performance of a}} dedicated <b>renal</b> <b>stent</b> device and the clinical outcome. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty patients with 55 renal artery stenoses (RAS) < 70 % (66 +/- 12 years, 58 % male) were included in this non-randomised, prospective, multicentre registry. Primary endpoint was the primary patency rate at one year defined as < or = 70 % as determined by duplex ultrasound. Major secondary endpoints were procedural success, 30 days MACE rate, {{the impact of the}} intervention on renal function, blood pressure control, and on B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level. Procedural success rate was 100 % and 30 days MACE rate was 0 %. Restenosis rate (primary endpoint) and target lesion revascularisation rate after 12 months were 3. 5 % and 1. 8 %, respectively. After one year estimated glomerular filtration rate increased from 51 +/- 26 ml/min to 61 +/- 28 ml/min (P= 0. 004). Mean ambulatory blood pressure was reduced from 102 +/- 14 mmHg to 93 +/- 9 mmHg (P= 0. 001). Mean daily dose of antihypertensive drugs decreased from 3. 0 +/- 1. 7 to 2. 7 +/- 1. 4 (P= 0. 09).

MethodsWe reviewed clinical data of consecutive patients treated with the Zenith fenestrated endovascular graft in the United States at seven institutions with early commercial access from July 2012 to December 2012. Clinical outcomes and compliance to anatomic guidelines were compared with results of the U. S. fenestrated trial (USFT). ResultsFifty-seven patients were treated. There were significantly more (P  4 -mm infrarenal neck, and there were significantly more mesenteric stents (13 vs 0; P <. 05) used in this group than in the USFT, reflecting the higher anatomic complexity of these patients.

ConclusionsDespite higher rates of comorbidities and more challenging anatomy, early 30 -day outcomes of juxtarenal aortic aneurysms treated postapproval with the Zenith fenestrated endovascular graft compare well with USFT data. Future studies are needed to assess durability of this treatment modality as the technology diffuses and data mature...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} imaging {{characteristics and}} artifacts of a nitinol stent with distal tantalum markers with computed tomography (CT) angiography and magnetic resonance (MR) angiography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A vascular phantom {{was built to}} simulate in-stent restenosis. A nitinol stent with tantalum markers (Luminexx stent) was evaluated with CT angiography in different orientations relative to the z-axis and with MR angiography in different positions relative to both B 0 and the readout gradient. Stenosis measurements were compared with conventional digital subtraction angiography for both modalities. In-stent signal intensity obtained with different flip angles was assessed in two nitinol stents with distal markers (Luminexx stent and SMART stent) and one without markers (Memotherm-FLEXX stent). RESULTS: Stenosis detection was not possible with CT angiography when the stent was perpendicular to the z-axis because of streak-like artifacts induced by tantalum markers. Stenosis evaluation with multiplanar reformation was accurate when the stent was in parallel and oblique orientations relative to the table axis. With MR angiography, metallic artifacts were mostly related to the stent orientation with B 0, whereas orientation of the readout gradient had little influence. The mean error (overestimation) for stenosis measurements varied between 0. 1 % and 7. 4 % for CT imaging in parallel and oblique positions and 3. 6 % and 9. 5 % for MR imaging. Higher flip angles did not improve signal intensity inside the three stents tested. CONCLUSION: CT and MR angiography {{can be used for}} evaluating the patency of stents with distal markers that are parallel or oblique relative to the table axis (iliac, carotid, or femoral stents). MR angiography is preferred if the stent is perpendicular to the table axis (<b>renal</b> <b>stent)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveThe primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze renal artery interventions performed at a tertiary medical center and to evaluate improvements in hypertension and renal excretory function. MethodsA retrospective analysis was performed of patients treated at a tertiary medical center from January 2001 to December 2005. All patients treated with <b>renal</b> artery <b>stenting</b> by the Interventional Radiology or Endovascular Services were included. Descriptive and inferential analyses were performed. ResultsForty patients with renal artery stenosis were evaluated for <b>renal</b> artery <b>stenting,</b> of these 22 were followed up with medical management. Twenty-six <b>renal</b> artery <b>stents</b> were placed in 18 patients (mean age, 70 ± 8 years), of whom 76 % were treated for multidrug resistant hypertension, and 24 % were treated for renal salvage. Mean follow-up was 15 months. Patients experienced a significant reduction in hypertension and in the number of antihypertensive agents, but this significance deteriorated at 6 months, when their blood pressure and number of medications returned to preprocedural values. Compared with a cohort that was followed up with medical management, the rate of renal function decline improved from − 0. 08 mg/dL per month to 0. 00 mg/dL per month (P <. 05) after intervention. Patients with baseline chronic renal insufficiency experienced the greatest benefit from <b>renal</b> artery <b>stenting.</b> ConclusionsRenal artery stenting initially improves hypertension control, but the durability is lost after 6 months. <b>Renal</b> artery <b>stenting</b> dramatically slows the rate of renal function decline and could potentially delay a patient’s requirement for hemodialysis...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundAtherosclerotic renal artery {{stenosis}} (RAS) is {{the most}} common cause of secondary hypertension. <b>Renal</b> <b>stenting</b> has become the treatment of choice for RAS in most centers. Primary patency of RAS is well defined, but limited data are available on outcomes of secondary interventions for treatment of in-stent restenosis. MethodsThis was a retrospective analysis of a 10 -year experience with <b>renal</b> artery <b>stenting</b> in patients presenting with recurrent symptomatic stenosis. End points included freedom from tertiary procedures, change in baseline renal function by ≥ 20 % measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), patency confirmed by duplex imaging, long-term hypertension response, freedom from hemodialysis, and survival. ResultsWe reviewed 948 patients with 1150 treated renal arteries. Of these, 107 patients (122 <b>renal</b> <b>stents)</b> returned with symptomatic in-stent restenosis and required reintervention (target vessel revascularization [TVR] rate, 10. 6 %) : 97 % had recurrent or worsening hypertension, and 67 % had worsening renal function. There were 69 women (64 %) and 38 men (35 %) with an average age of 68. 9 years. Mean follow-up was 35. 5 months (range, 1. 0 - 104. 7 months) for patency and 37. 7 months (range, 0. 03 - 100. 9 months) for renal function (creatinine). Secondary interventions included 27 percutaneous transluminal angioplasties (PTAs), 10 PTAs with cutting balloon, 77 repeat <b>renal</b> artery <b>stenting,</b> and 8 placements of drug-eluting stents (DES). Twenty-five of the 122 arteries (20 %) required tertiary interventions in 23 patients, a significantly higher TVR rate vs de novo interventions (11 %; P =. 003). Freedom from tertiary interventions at 60 months was similar among treatment groups undergoing PTA (66 %), cutting balloon (100 %), stent (80 %), and DES (75 %; P =. 348). Seventeen (16 %) had an increase of > 20 %, 50 (47 %) had a decrease of > 20 %, and 30 (28 %) had no change in renal function. Ultimately 25 (23 %) remained or progressed to renal failure (eGFR < 30 %), and 8 required hemodialysis. The survival rate was 73 % at 5 years. Mean follow-up for long-term hypertension response was 3. 2 years, with 56 % improved, 28 % with no improvement or deterioration, 16 % without long-term data available, and no patients cured. ConclusionsSecondary interventions for renal in-stent restenosis had higher TVR vs de novo <b>renal</b> <b>stents</b> in this large series (21 % vs 11 %; P =. 003). Definitive recommendations on the best secondary treatment strategy cannot be made because a medical treatment control group was not available for comparison...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesTo {{identify}} {{evidence to}} guide the vascular surgeon as to the relevance of <b>renal</b> artery <b>stenting</b> in a patient with symptomatic renal artery stenosis undergoing elective endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). MethodsA comprehensive literature search of MEDLINE was performed without time limits. The following terms {{were used in the}} first instance: <b>renal</b> artery <b>stenting</b> and <b>renal</b> artery stenosis, and any other analogous terms identified during the search. Selection criteria were set to randomised control trials. ResultsDespite several large, randomised controlled trials investigating <b>renal</b> artery <b>stenting</b> against medical treatment alone in symptomatic renal artery stenosis, there has been no significant benefit identified in terms of improvement in renal function, control of blood pressure, or need for dialysis. The stented populations {{were also more likely to}} suffer from complications caused by the procedure such as bleeding, cholesterol embolisation and flash pulmonary oedema. ConclusionThere is no evidence for the use of <b>renal</b> artery <b>stenting</b> over optimal medical management in the treatment of patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, irrelevant of the degree of stenosis. In the setting of EVAR, prevention of deterioration of renal function should be with involvement of the renal physicians, adequate hydration, and use of minimal contrast agent.

40|$|Introduction : Randomized trials {{comparing}} {{invasive treatment}} of renal artery stenosis with standard pharmacotherapy {{did not show}} substantial benefit from revascularization. One of the potential reasons for that may be suboptimal procedure technique. Aim : To compare <b>renal</b> <b>stent</b> sizing using two modalities: three-dimensional renal computed tomography angiography (CTA) versus conventional angiography. Material and methods: Forty patients (41 renal arteries), aged 65. 1 ± 8. 5 years, who underwent renal artery stenting with preprocedural CTA performed within 6 months, were retrospectively analyzed. In CTA analysis, reference diameter (CTA-D) and lesion length (CTA_LL) were measured and proposed stent diameter and length were recorded. Similarly, angiographic reference diameter (ANGIO_D) and lesion length (ANGIO_LL) as well as proposed stent dimensions were obtained by visual estimation. Results: The median CTA_D was 0. 5 mm larger than the median ANGIO_D (p < 0. 001). Also, the proposed stent diameter in CTA evaluation was 0. 5 mm larger than that in angiography (p < 0. 0001). The median CTA_LL was 1 mm longer than the ANGIO_LL (p = NS), with significant correlation of these variables (r = 0. 66, p < 0. 0001). The median proposed stent length with CTA was equal to that proposed with angiography. The median diameter of the implanted stent was 0. 5 mm smaller than that proposed in CTA (p < 0. 0005) and identical to that proposed in angiography. The median length of the actual stent was longer than that proposed in angiography (p = 0. 0001). Conclusions : Renal CTA has potential advantages as a tool adjunctive to angiography in appropriate stent sizing. Careful evaluation of the available CTA scans may be beneficial and should be considered prior to the planned procedure...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{fenestrated}} Anaconda endograft (Vascutek, Renfrewshire, Scotland) {{was introduced}} in 2010 and showed promising short-term results with high technical success and low morbidity rates. The {{aim of this study}} was to present the midterm results, with a minimum of 12 months follow-up, for all patients treated with the fenestrated Anaconda endograft in The Netherlands. Methods: Patients treated with the fenestrated Anaconda endograft between May 2011 and February 2015 were included. Follow-up consisted of computed tomography angiography at 1 month and 1 year, and duplex ultrasound yearly thereafter with additional computed tomography angiography if indicated using a standard protocol. Results: A total of 60 patients were included; 48 patients (80. 0 %) were treated for juxtarenal aneurysms, and 12 (20. 0 %) were short-neck infrarenal aneurysms. Mean aneurysm size was 64 6 9 mm. A total of 140 fenestrations were incorporated. Median follow-up was 16. 4 months (interquartile range, 11. 9 - 27. 4). The 30 -day mortality was 3. 4 % (n 2). Kaplan-Meier estimates for 1 -year, 2 -year, and 3 -year survival were 91. 4 %, 89. 5 %, and 86. 3 %, respectively, without aneurysm-related mortality during follow-up. Main body primary and secondary endograft patencies were 98. 3 % and 100 %, respectively. Target vessel primary and secondary patencies were 95. 0 % and 98. 6 %, respectively. Early type IA endoleaks occurred in seven patients (11. 7 %) and spontaneously resolved in all patients. At 1 -year follow-up 4 (6. 7 %) type II endoleaks persisted. One patient experienced aneurysm rupture because of a late type III endoleak attributable to a dislodged <b>renal</b> <b>stent</b> and subsequently underwent successful conversion to open surgery. Conclusions: The fenestrated Anaconda is a viable treatment option for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms. Acceptable mortality and morbidity and low reintervention rates contribute to good midterm results. Occurrence of early type I endoleak was relatively common, but these resolved spontaneously in all patients...|$|E
40|$|Background: The chimney/periscope {{technique}} {{has been used}} to address complex aortic pathologies. This study aimed to report the outcomes and experiences of chimney and/or periscope grafts (CPGs) used in the endovascular management of complex aortic pathologies. Methods: Twenty-two patients with complex aortic pathologies were retrospectively studied from January 2013 to August 2016 in two vascular centers of teaching hospitals. All patients were diagnosed using computed tomography angiography (CTA). The patients were followed up at postoperative 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and yearly thereafter with X-ray, ultrasound, and/or CTA. Results: Twenty-two cases (17 males; mean age 60. 7 ± 16. 3 years) with complex aortic pathologies were analyzed. Nineteen patients underwent CPGs only, and the other three cases underwent the simultaneous implantation of chimney/periscope and fenestrated/scallop grafts. Twenty-six arteries were managed with forty CPGs during the procedures. Complete angiographies revealed two Type I endoleaks, one Type III endoleak, and one Type IV endoleak. Other intraoperative complications included brachial thrombosis, external iliac artery rupture, and left renal stenosis. The 30 -day mortality was 0. The mean follow-up was 26. 1 ± 10. 1 months with a range of 2 – 39 months. During the follow-up, two Type I endoleaks and one Type IV endoleak were observed. One right <b>renal</b> <b>stent</b> occlusion occurred in the 5 th month and turned patent after reintervention. Three patients died during the follow-up, one due to an aneurysm rupture as a Type I endoleak, and two due to myocardial infarction. The instant technical success was 96 %. The primary and secondary patencies were 92 % and 96 %, respectively. The overall survival rates were 95 %, 84 %, and 84 % at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. Stent migration was not observed in any patient. Conclusions: Chimney/periscope techniques could be used to tackle complex aortic pathologies, but the indications must be strictly controlled, and additional experiences are required...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{perform a}} {{meta-analysis}} of <b>renal</b> arterial <b>stent</b> placement {{in comparison with}} renal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in patients with renal arterial stenosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studies dealing with <b>renal</b> arterial <b>stent</b> placement (14 articles; 678 patients) and renal PTA (10 articles; 644 patients) published up to August 1998 were selected. A random-effects model was used to pool the data. RESULTS: <b>Renal</b> arterial <b>stent</b> placement proved highly successful, with an initial adequate performance in 98 % and major complications in 11 %. The overall cure rate for hypertension was 20 %, whereas hypertension was improved in 49 %. Renal function improved in 30 % and stabilized in 38 % of patients. The restenosis rate at follow-up of 6 - 29 months was 17 %. Stent placement had a higher technical success rate and a lower restenosis rate than did renal PTA (98 % vs 77 % and 17 % vs 26 %, respectively; P <. 001). The complication rate was not different between the two treatments. The cure rate for hypertension was higher and the improvement rate for renal function was lower after stent placement than after renal PTA (20 % vs 10 % and 30 % vs 38 %, respectively; P <. 001). CONCLUSION: <b>Renal</b> arterial <b>stent</b> placement is technically superior and clinically comparable to renal PTA alone...|$|R
40|$|Background Many small trials {{showed a}} {{significant}} improvement in blood pressure following <b>renal</b> artery <b>stenting</b> in patients with severe atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, but data on renal function improvement is more conflicting. Recently, few trials have been conducted to evaluate {{the effect of this}} procedure on Left Ventricular Mass (LVM) and Left Ventricular Mass Index (LVMI). Objectives The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the effect of <b>renal</b> artery <b>stenting</b> on Blood Pressure, estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), Left Ventricular Mass (LVM), and Left Ventricular Mass Index (LVMI) in patients with severe atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. Methods This is a prospective interventional study performed on forty patients with ischemic heart disease and medication resistant hypertension, who had severe (≥ 70 %) atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and underwent <b>renal</b> artery <b>stenting.</b> Blood pressure, LVM, LVMI and eFGR before <b>renal</b> artery <b>stenting</b> and after six months were assessed in these patients. Results There were significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (from 175. 50 ± 17. 28 mmHg to 137. 30 ± 13. 21 mmHg) (P < 0. 001), and diastolic blood pressure (from 103. 45 ± 8. 91 mmHg to 84. 30 ± 7. 33 mmHg) (P < 0. 001). Also, there were significant decrease in LVM (from 307. 73 ± 108. 13 g to 259. 34 ± 92. 17 g) (P = 0. 004) and LVMI (from 174. 70 ± 58. 26 to 148. 01 ± 49. 77) (P = 0. 004). LVM reduction was independent of SBP and DBP reduction (P = 0. 376 and P = 0. 196, respectively). Conclusions <b>Renal</b> artery <b>stenting</b> reduces Blood pressure and leads to regression of LVM independent of blood pressure reduction. Regardless of baseline eGFR, our study failed to find a significant increase in glomerular filtration rate...|$|R
40|$|The safety, {{efficacy}} {{and long term}} clinical benefits of renal artery revascularization by stenting are still a matter of debate. The aim of our study was to define the safety and efficacy of renal artery stenting with the Tsunami peripheral stent (Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The ODORI was a prospective, multicentre registry which enrolled 251 consecutive patients, (276 renal arteries) in 36 centres across Europe. The primary endpoint was acute procedural success defined as < 30 % residual stenosis after stent placement. Secondary endpoints included major adverse events, blood pressure control, serum creatinine level, and target lesion revascularization (TLR) at 6 and 12  months. Patients were 70  ±  10 years old, 59 % were male, 33 % had diabetes, and 96 % hypertension. The main indications for <b>renal</b> <b>stent</b> implantation were hypertension in 83 % and renal salvage in 39 %. Direct stent implantation was performed in 76 % of the cases. Acute success rate was 100 % with residual stenosis of 2. 5  ±  5. 4 %. Systolic/diastolic blood pressure decreased from a mean of 171 / 89 at baseline to 142 / 78  mmHg at 6  months (p <  0. 0001 vs. baseline), and 141 / 80  mmHg at 12  months (p < 0. 0001 vs. baseline). Mean serum creatinine concentration did not change significantly in the total population. However, there was significant improvement in the highest tercile (from 283  μmol/l at baseline to 205 and 209  μmol/l at 6 and 12  months respectively). At 12 -months, rates of restenosis and TLR were 6. 6 and 0. 8 % respectively. The 12  month cumulative rate of all major clinical adverse events was 6. 4 % while the rate of device or procedure related events was 2. 4 %. In hypertensive patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis Tsunami peripheral balloon-expandable stent provides a safe revascularization strategy, with a potential beneficial impact on hypertension control and renal function in the highest risk patients...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesAlthough suprarenal {{fixation}} may be {{of benefit}} during endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), its safety with regards to renal effects remains uncertain. To date, {{there has been no}} controlled study of the topic, with most reports relying upon single-center experiences that use heterogeneous patient populations and devices from different manufacturers. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the effect of suprarenal fixation on renal function by comparing homogeneous patient populations receiving EVAR grafts from a single manufacturer that are identical in design and delivery method, except for utilizing either suprarenal (SR) or infrarenal (IR) fixation. MethodsDuring two pivotal US Food and Drug Administration trials, 283 patients underwent EVAR with the Powerlink bifurcated graft. The trials’ inclusion and exclusion criteria and grafts were identical except for fixation scheme. Clinical, laboratory, and computed tomographic (CT) data were retrospectively reviewed. A comparison of preoperative, perioperative (1 to 7 days), and postoperative (> 7 days) alterations in serum creatinine (SCr), creatinine clearance (CrCl), and blood pressure was performed. Renal adverse events were determined by CT scan and clinical chart review and included renal infarction, renal artery stenosis (either progressive or requiring <b>renal</b> <b>stent</b> placement), and renal artery occlusion. ResultsBoth SR and IR groups demonstrated a significant increase in SCr and a decrease in CrCl over time. No significant difference in SCr or CrCl existed between groups during any time period. There were no differences in postoperative renal impairment (IR, 10. 2 %; SR, 7. 6 %, P =. 634), the need for hemodialysis (IR, 0. 7 %; SR, 0 %, P = 1. 00), or systolic and diastolic blood pressure during subsequent follow-up between treatment groups. There {{was no significant difference in}} the number of renal adverse events detected by CT between the IR (10, 6. 8 %) and SR (3, 3. 8 %) groups (P =. 550). ConclusionSuprarenal fixation does not lead to a significant increase in acute renal events, renal impairment, or alteration in blood pressure compared with infrarenal fixation. Patients undergoing aneurysm repair with devices that use either suprarenal or infrarenal fixation develop progressive renal dysfunction over time. Further studies are needed to determine the long-term effects of suprarenal fixation on renal function and progression of renal artery stenosis...|$|E

This report presents the 1 -year results from 400 patients enrolled in this registry. MethodsBetween August 2010 and December 2012, 400 patients (86. 8 % male, mean age 73. 9  ±  7. 8 years) from 13 European sites were enrolled in this registry. Patient demographics, treatment indication, case planning, operative details including repositioning and technical results, and clinical outcome were analyzed. ResultsTechnical success was achieved in 396 / 400 (99 %) patients. Two patients needed intraoperative open conversion, one for iliac rupture, the second because the stent-graft was pulled down during a cross-over catheterization in an angulated anatomy. Two patients required an unplanned chimney <b>renal</b> <b>stent</b> to treat partial coverage of the left renal artery because of upward displacement of the stent-graft. Graft repositioning occurred in 192 / 399 (48. 1 %) patients, most frequently for level readjustment {{with regard to the}} renal arteries, and less commonly for contralateral gate reorientation. Final intended position of the stent-graft below the renal arteries was achieved in 96. 2 % of patients. Thirty-day mortality was two (0. 5 %) patients. Early reintervention (≤ 30 days) was required in two (0. 5 %) patients. Mean follow-up duration was 15. 9  ±  8. 8 months (range 0 – 37 months). Late reintervention (> 30 days) was required in 26 (6. 5 %) patients. Estimated freedom from reintervention at 1 year was 95. 2 % (95 % CI 92. 3 – 97 %), and at 2 years 91. 5 % (95 % CI 86. 8 – 94. 5 %). Estimated patient survival at 1 year was 96 % (95 % CI 93. 3 – 97. 6 %) and at 2 years 90. 6 % (95 % CI 85. 6 – 93. 9 %).

While some {{evidence suggests that}} treatment with stent placement is beneficial, randomized trials have failed to demonstrate a significant benefit. Ongoing clinical trials should help to better define the role for stenting of RAS while avoiding limitations seen with earlier trials. When it comes to stenting for RAS, several stents have been used; however, many stents which have been used previously and which are still being used are biliary stents that are used &ldquo;off-label. &rdquo; These stents have typically come onto the market through the 510 (k) pathway.

MethodsUsing data from 947 patients with a history of hypertension or chronic kidney disease from the largest randomized trial of <b>renal</b> artery <b>stent</b> placement, the CORAL (Cardiovascular Outcomes in Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions) study, we performed exploratory analyses to determine if subsets of patients experienced better outcomes after stent placement than the overall cohort. We examined baseline stenosis severity, systolic blood pressure, and translesion pressure gradient (peak systolic and mean) and performed interaction tests and Cox proportional hazards analyses for the occurrence of the primary endpoint through all follow-up, to examine the effect of these variables on outcomes by treatment group.
