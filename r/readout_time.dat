2500|$|Serial time encoded amplified {{microscopy}} (STEAM) is an {{imaging method}} that provides ultrafast shutter speed and frame rate, by using optical image amplification {{to circumvent the}} fundamental trade-off between sensitivity and speed, and a single-pixel photodetector to {{eliminate the need for}} a detector array and <b>readout</b> <b>time</b> limitations [...] The method is at least 1000 times faster than the state-of-the-art CCD and CMOS cameras. Consequently, it is potentially useful for a broad range of scientific, industrial, and biomedical applications that require high image acquisition rates, including real-time diagnosis and evaluation of shockwaves, microfluidics, MEMS, and laser surgery.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} answer these questions, it is of {{particular}} interest to investigate cosmic rays in the 1012 to 1015 eV region due to several theories predicting a change in elemental composition just below the knee. To determine the elemental spectrum of cosmic rays, CREAM uses a silicon charge detector, timing charge detector, and scintillating fiber hodoscopes to detect the charge of incident particles up to that of iron (Z = 26). Energies are measured with a transition radiation detector (TRD), along with an ionization calorimeter. Because all detectors are in close proximity of each other, it is a prime concern to minimize the interaction between showers produced in the calorimeter, and the charge-measuring instruments. To dampen this effect, CREAM uses a larger number of pixels with a smaller area, along with a very fast <b>readout</b> <b>time</b> to differentiate between events caused by the primary particle and events caused by back-scattering from the calorimeter.|$|E
50|$|Serial time-encoded amplified imaging/microscopy or {{stretched}} time-encoded amplified imaging/microscopy (STEAM) is a fast real-time optical {{imaging method}} that provides MHz frame rate, ~100 ps shutter speed, and ~30 dB (× 1000) optical image gain. Based on the Photonic Time Stretch technique, STEAM holds world records for shutter speed and frame rate in continuous real-time imaging. STEAM employs the Photonic Time Stretch with internal Raman amplification to realize optical image amplification {{to circumvent the}} fundamental trade-off between sensitivity and speed that affects virtually all optical imaging and sensing systems. This method uses a single-pixel photodetector, {{eliminating the need for}} the detector array and <b>readout</b> <b>time</b> limitations. Avoiding this problem and featuring the optical image amplification for dramatic improvement in sensitivity at high image acquisition rates, STEAMs shutter speed is at least 1000 times faster than the state-of-the-art CCD and CMOS cameras. Its frame rate is 1000 times faster than fastest CCD cameras and 10-100 times faster than fastest CMOS cameras.|$|E

40|$|Driven by {{the long}} readout times of today's large format CCDs, we present an {{efficient}} method to compute an ideal sequence of exposure times for twilight sky flats. The procedure will allow the observer to maximize the number of flats that can be obtained in the rapidly changing surface brightness of the dusk or dawn sky. 1 INTRODUCTION Large format CCDs are now commonly used {{in many of the}} world's major observatories. Their popularity is, of course, derived from their large area, which had been the only remaining advantage of photographic over digital surveys. A major drawback, however, (aside from the disk gymnastics of managing enormous images), is the long <b>readout</b> <b>time</b> that an observer must endure at the telescope. Currently, for example, the <b>readout</b> <b>time</b> of the Tek 2048 x 2048 chip, available for the 0. 9 m telescope at CTIO (binned 1 x 1, with 4 e - /adu), takes nearly four minutes.

30|$|Since IR 2 {{does not}} have a {{mechanical}} shutter and its detector {{does not have}} frame-transfer architecture, the exposure time is the sum of the interval between “pre-” and “post”-readouts (wipes) plus one <b>readout</b> <b>time.</b> The shortest possible exposure time (6.97  s) is therefore the <b>readout</b> <b>time</b> (zero interval) mostly limited by the speed of the 14 -bit AD converter. The permitted length of an interval is programmed in a so-called clock pattern that performs “pre-” and “post”-readouts and waits for the preset interval. There are several clock patterns with different intervals (multiples of 6  s), and the choice is prescribed in the observation program. (Different clock patterns may be called for different filters in one observation program.) The exposure times provided in Table  2 are thus defined by the choice of clock patterns.|$|E
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{belief that the}} next decade will see the {{emergence}} of sensing devices based on the laws of quantum physics that outperform some of our current sensing devices. For example, in frequency estimation, using a probe prepared in an entangled state can, in principle, lead to a precision gain compared to a probe prepared in a separable state. Even {{in the presence of}} some forms of decoherence, {{it has been shown that}} the precision gain can increase with the number of probe particles N. Usually, however, the entangled and separable state preparation and <b>readout</b> <b>times</b> are assumed to be negligible. We find that a probe in a maximally entangled (GHZ) state can give an advantage over a separable state only if the entangled state preparation and <b>readout</b> <b>times</b> are lower than a certain threshold. When the probe system suffers dephasing, this threshold is much lower (and more difficult to attain) than it is for an isolated probe. Further, we find that in realistic situations the maximally entangled probe gives a precision advantage only up to some finite number of probe particles N_cutoff that is lower for a dephasing probe than it is for an isolated probe.

40|$|A quantum {{metrology}} {{protocol for}} parameter estimation is typically comprised of three stages: probe state preparation, sensing and then <b>readout,</b> where the <b>time</b> {{required for the}} first and last stages is usually neglected. In the present work we consider non-negligible state preparation and <b>readout</b> <b>times,</b> and the tradeoffs in sensitivity that come when a limited time resource τ must be divided between the three stages. To investigate this, we focus on the problem of magnetic field sensing with spins in one-axis twisted or two-axis twisted states. We find that (accounting for the time necessary to prepare a twisted state) by including entanglement, which is introduced via the twisting, no advantage is gained unless the time τ is sufficiently long or the twisting sufficiently strong. However, we also find that the limited time resource is used more effectively if we allow the twisting and the magnetic field to be applied concurrently which is representative of a more realistic sensing scenario. We extend this result into the optical regime by utilizing the exact correspondence between a spin system and a bosonic field mode as given by the Holstein-Primakoff transformation.

40|$|Abstract. Low {{light level}} imaging has been revolutionised {{in recent years}} with the {{introduction}} of Electron Multiply-ing Charge Coupled Devices (EMCCDs).

EMCCDs incorporate an additional gain register through which the sig-nal passes as it is read out of the CCD array.
