40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to derive}} historically <b>realised</b> <b>volatilities</b> for swaptions {{of a long-term}} nature within the South African market, which is illiquid and over-the- counter. To achieve this the dissertation adopts and constructs non-parametric methods which only make use of historical realised data of the underlying variable rather than any implied pricing history of the derivative itself. Stutzer's method of canonical valuation (1996) is adapted for use with interest rate derivatives of a long-term nature. However, under a simulation of swaption prices, canonical valuation is {{found to have a}} monotonic increase in pricing error for swaptions of maturities over 2 to 15 years. A new method is constructed, named the relative entropy approach, which is {{based on the work of}} Buchen and Kelly (1996) and is capable of pricing long-term interest rate derivatives using a smoothed continuous distribution of the historical realised data of the underlying variable only, while market implied pricing data can also be incorporated for calibration of the derivative to current market prices. Under simulation this method maintains consistent and bounded pricing error across swaption maturities of up to 15 years. This method is then used to obtain historical <b>realised</b> <b>volatilities</b> for swaptions of a long-term nature. The derived ten-year tenor swaption skews under the relative entropy approach observe smile characterisitcs similar to that of the market implied skew over short-term maturities and maintain a volatility smile, albeit diminishing, across moneyness for maturities up to 20 years. The skews are further tested for sensitivity to the input historical data as well as the precision of the skew under implementation of the relative entropy approach. Results show the derived swaption skews to be robust when using a historical data set greater than 1200 observations. The swaption skew is sensitive to the nature of the historical data used which is representative of particular market characteristics over certain historical periods. The relative entropy approach is concluded capable of pricing long-term swaptions in a market where little or no option pricing data exists and could be considered for use in practical applications...|$|R
50|$|As {{with many}} leading ideas, the {{principle}} of the timer call is remarkably simple: instead of a dealer needing to use an implied volatility to use in pricing the option, the volatility is fixed, and the maturity is left floating. As a result of this, the Timer Call allows the pricing of call and put options on underlyings for which ordinary options are not priced; dealers in a normal option are exposed to the difference between the volatility they estimate and the <b>realised</b> <b>volatility,</b> whereas in a Timer Call, this risk is much diminished.|$|E
5000|$|... 3) Implied {{volatility}} against realized volatility [...] In {{a number}} of markets such as commodities and rates, the implied volatility, as implied by straddle prices {{is higher than the}} realized volatility of the underlying forward. One way to 'exploit' this is to sell a short expiry (e.g. 1 month) straddle and delta-hedging it until it is alive. The strategy makes money if at expiry, the sum of the premium received (and accrued at money market), the (negative) final value of the straddle and the (positive/negative) value of the forwards (entered into to delta-hedge the straddle) is greater than zero. A variation of this, and more common solution in equity, is to sell either a one-month or three-month variance swap - usually on the Eurostoxx 50E or S&P500 index - that pays a positive performance if the implied volatility (strike of the swap) is above the <b>realised</b> <b>volatility</b> at expiry; in this case {{there is no need to}} delta-hedging the underlying movements.|$|E

40|$|We {{employ a}} {{two-stage}} general dynamic factor model method to analyse the co-movements between returns and between volatilities of stocks {{belonging to the}} US, European, and Japanese financial markets.

When computed in general semimartingale asset price models, the cumulative squared high frequency returns represent consistent estimators of the integrated volatility. Both time and frequency domain estimators are available for solving what, in an unifying approach, could be considered an inverse problem, the recovery of latent volatility from the realizations of observable return processes. Since the relation between <b>realised</b> and integrated <b>volatility</b> implies that one is transformed into the other with noise, we work in a simulated environment of Brownian motion paths for exemplifying the semimartingale context and produce randomized estimators for the volatility.

This paper presents a new adaptive method for predicting the volatility in financial returns. It enables the smoothing parameter to vary as a logistic function of user-specified variables. The approach is analogous to that used to model time-varying parameters in smooth transition GARCH models. These non-linear models allow the dynamics of the conditional variance model to be influenced by the sign and size of past shocks. These factors can also be used as transition variables in the new smooth transition {{exponential smoothing}} approach. Parameters are estimated for the method by minimising the sum of squared deviations between <b>realised</b> and forecast <b>volatility.</b> Using stock index data, the new method gave encouraging results when compared to fixed parameter exponential smoothing and a variety of GARCH models.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three essays on topics in financial time series with particular emphases on specification testing, structural breaks and long memory. The first essay develops an asymptotically valid specification testing framework for the Realised GARCH model of Hansen et al. (2012). The misspecification tests account for the joint dependence between return and the <b>realised</b> measure of <b>volatility</b> and thus extend the existing literature for testing the adequacy of GARCH models. The testing procedure is constructed based on the conditional moment principle and the first-order asymptotic theory. Our Monte Carlo results reveal good finite sample size and power properties. In the second essay, a Monte Carlo experiment is conducted to investigate the relative out-of-sample predictive ability of a class of conditional variance models when either a structural break or long memory is allowed. Our Monte Carlo results reveal that if the true volatility process is stationary short memory and its persistence level is not too high, but is contaminated by a structural break, {{the presence of the}} structural break is of importance in choosing a proper size of estimation window in the short-run forecast. If the persistence level is very high, spurious long memory may often dominate the true structural break in the longer-run forecast. For data generation processes without any structural break, the forecasting models, which can characterise the properties of the true conditional variance process, are favourable. In the last essay, we analyse the properties of the S&P 500 stock index return volatility process using historical and <b>realised</b> measures of <b>volatility.</b> We investigate a true property of the stochastic volatility processes by means of econometric tests, which may disentangle true or spurious long memory. The realised variance and realised kernel of the US stock market return exhibit true long memory. However, the historical volatility process shows some evidence of spurious long memory. We examine relative out-of-sample performance of one-day-ahead forecasts, with emphasis on the predictive content of structural changes and long memory. A class of ARFIMA models consistently produces the best-performing forecasts compared to a class of GARCH models.

40|$|Contagion {{has been}} {{described}} as the spread of idiosyncratic shocks from one mar ket to another in times of ﬁnancial turmoil. In this work, contagion has been modelled using a global factor to capture the general market movements and idiosyncratic shocks are used to capture co-movements and volatility spill-over between markets. Many previous studies have used pre-speciﬁed turmoil and calm periods to understand when contagion occurs. We introduce time-varying parameters which model the volatility spillover from one country to another. This approach avoids the need to pre-specify particular types of periods using external information. Eﬃcient Bayesian inference can be made using the Kalman ﬁlter in a forward ﬁltering and backward sampling algorithm. The model is applied to market indices for Greece and Spain to understand the eﬀect of contagion dur ing the European sovereign debt crisis 2007 - 2013 (Euro crisis) and examine the volatility spillover between Greece and Spain. Similarly, the volatility spillover from Hong Kong to Singapore during the Asian ﬁnancial crisis 1997 - 1998 has also been studied. After a review of the research work in the ﬁnancial contagion area and of the deﬁnitions used, we have speciﬁed a model based on the work by Dungey et al. (2005) and include a world factor. Time varying parameters are introduced and Bayesian inference and MCMC simulations are used to estimate the parameters. This is followed by work using the Normal Mixture model based on the paper by Kim et al.

40|$|Despite {{a growing}} {{research}} interest in option trading {{and its impact}} on the pricing of the underlying asset, the role of options as a vehicle for informed trading remains an important economic question which has not yet been fully explored. In fact, even though academics have often argued that informed traders may prefer to trade in the option market rather than the equity market 1, the question of whether (and to what extent) such a proposition would hold in practice has not been systematically addressed in the literature. This overarching research problem forms the foundation of this doctoral research project, leading to two important research questions. First, if investors do in fact use options to trade on information about underlying stock prices in practice, what implications does this have for the option (stock) pricing and forecasting? Second, what are the key factors driving traders’ decisionsto trade on new information in one market over another? These two issues correspond to the two gaps found in the extant literature on option trading, and also in the strand of empirical studies focusing on the role of options as a mechanism for trading on information about the underlying asset. To explore these research questions, three interrelated projects have been undertaken, each with a unique contribution to informing the research topic. These closely related investigations jointly provide consolidated answers to the two research questions raised previously. In response to the first research question, we pursue two strands of empirical investigation to examine the presence of informed trading in the option market. Firstly, we investigate the extent to which the information content extracted from options trading can be used to enhance predictions of the future <b>volatility</b> <b>realised</b> by underlying stocks. Secondly, we examine the price impact of information trading activities within the option market, focusing especially on the way in which the level of trading activities can explain and predict the future dynamics of the option implied volatility smile. Both of these strands yield evidence in support of information trading activities existing in the option market. Regarding the second research question, our collective evidence indicates that the allocation of informed traders between option and stock markets depends on the trade-off of transactioncosts and trading opportunities existing in two related markets. This finding has consistently been corroborated by separate evidence emerging from our independent investigations. We found that the degree of information trading in the option market varies across different stocks, corresponding to variations in the level of individual stock liquidity. It has also been found that the degree of information asymmetry of option trades changed in response to changes in trading costs driven by regulatory changes observed during the 2008 short-sale ban. This research makes a valuable contribution to the field of option research. From the theoretical perspective, it addresses significant gaps in the existing literature and extends our understanding of informed trading activities in the option market. In particular, it contributes to the body of knowledge on the economic value of derivatives by investigating the critical role they have played in the process of incorporating new information into the market. From the practical perspective, it proposes a simple-yet-effective technique which employs trading volume to improve forecasts of the underlying stock volatility and of the option implied volatility (price) respectively. Since volatility plays such a central role in the practice of derivatives trading, risk analysis and portfolio management, better forecasts of these quantities are clearly important and highly regarded by practitioners. 1 Mainly due to higher financial leverages, reduced transactions costs and wider trading opportunities (eg speculation on volatility) (Black, 1975).

40|$|The {{exchange}} rate {{is one of}} the most vital components in any economic and investment decision. With the increase in globalisation, there is a concomitant increase in the {{exchange rate}} risk in any global investment decision. This Ph. D. thesis examines asset pricing in the foreign exchange market in various dimensions, introduces new techniques for performance measurement and information flow, and attempts to explain the carry trade in the foreign exchange market. The economic significance of empirical exchange rates models in a portfolio-based framework was examined, using a thirty-year time series of five exchange rates. The forecast performances were evaluated in mean-variance and performance index (indices of acceptability) to compare the fundamental exchange rate models with a benchmark random walk model. The parameters were computed using advanced computational finance and econometric techniques. The performance measurements obtained from mean-variance by various models were compared using the Sharpe ratio. It was concluded that the structural model, although unable to beat the random walk model, did not perform worse than the forecasts obtained from the benchmark model. The results from the indices of acceptability evaluation indicate that one-month ahead forecasts obtained from the monetary model of the exchange rate performed better than the benchmark model. Furthermore, the information flow in the foreign exchange market was examined by evaluating the relationship between volatility and the customers' trading activity. An attempt was made to explain the relationship between volatility and customer order flows in a portfolio-based framework with unique aggregate and disaggregate customer order-flow data from the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS). This was the largest private dataset used to-date in a study of the foreign exchange market. The relationship was found to be robust; that is, the order flow {{is one of the}} main sources for transmitting private information to the foreign exchange market. This relationship holds across all the currencies and in various volatility estimates. This study is the first in the foreign exchange market in the aforementioned setup, and robustly elucidates the cited relationship in the foreign exchange market. The results give significant support to information being asymmetric across classes of customers and that private information is transmitted to the foreign exchange market by the trading behaviour of informed customers. Moreover, the volatility patterns in the foreign exchange market are significantly and substantially affected by the customer order flows. The size of the trade impact on volatility in a portfolio-based approach was also examined and it was found that the large sales are more influential trades on volatility in the foreign exchange market. In addition, to study the subsequent volatility, there was an examination of two existing hypotheses; i. e., the liquidity-driven-trade-hypothesis (positive subsequent relationship), and the information-driven-trade-hypothesis (negative subsequent relationship.) Both phenomena were found to exist, depending on the economic condition of the market. Finally, an explanation was given for the existence and identification of the carry trade in the foreign exchange market. When an investor borrows from a low interest-rate currency and invests in a higher interest-rate currency, zero-investment portfolio, this trading strategy is called carry trade strategy. Again, a novel data set provided by the UBS was examined to establish a relationship between the ordering patterns of informed customers and the carry trade. The forward discount bias and the carry trade were studied using theories of microstructure finance and the consumption-based asset-pricing model in a portfolio-based framework. The microstructure approach is the standard model of Evans and Lyons (2002). It was found that the order flow significantly explained the excess return in the carry trade, implying that informed customers knew about the carry trade opportunities in the market and reorganised their portfolios in order to <b>realise</b> these gains. <b>Volatility</b> and customer order flows were also examined, using a GMM approach, as a global innovation factor, and it was found that both variables significantly explained the cross-section of carry returns in the foreign exchange market...|$|R
