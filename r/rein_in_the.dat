5|$|Emperor Gaozong {{supported}} settling a {{peace treaty}} with the Jurchens and sought to <b>rein</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> assertiveness of the military. The military expeditions of Yue Fei and other generals were an obstacle to peace negotiations. The government weakened the military by rewarding Yue Fei, Han Shizhong, and Zhang Jun (1086–1154) with titles that relieved them of their command over the Song armies. Han Shizhong, {{a critic of the}} treaty, retired. Yue Fei also announced his resignation as an act of protest. In 1141 Qin Hui had him imprisoned for insubordination. Charged with treason, Yue Fei was poisoned in jail on Qin's orders in early 1142. Jurchen diplomatic pressure during the peace talks may have played a role, but Qin Hui's alleged collusion with the Jin has never been proven.|$|E
5|$|Hitler's speech signalled his {{intention}} to <b>rein</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SA, whose ranks had grown rapidly in the early 1930s. This would not prove to be simple, however, as the SA made up {{a large part of}} Nazism's most devoted followers. The SA traced its dramatic rise in numbers in part to the onset of the Great Depression, when many German citizens lost both their jobs and their faith in traditional institutions. While Nazism was not exclusively– or even primarily– a working class phenomenon, the SA fulfilled the yearning of many unemployed workers for class solidarity and nationalist fervour. Many stormtroopers believed in the socialist promise of National Socialism and expected the Nazi regime to take more radical economic action, such as breaking up the vast landed estates of the aristocracy. When the Nazi regime did not take such steps, those who had expected an economic as well as a political revolution were disillusioned.|$|E
5|$|In April 1920, Hananu {{coordinated the}} {{shipment}} of Turkish arms to Saleh al-Ali's forces in their {{revolt against the}} French in the coastal mountains south of Latakia. Faisal's government aided Hananu's movement financially and logistically via local Arab nationalist intermediaries. French General Henri Gouraud demanded that Faisal <b>rein</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rebels of northern Syria and end their resistance to the French military advance. Faisal continued to oppose French rule and his government launched a campaign to conscript soldiers from throughout the country in May {{as part of a}} last-ditch effort to defend Damascus against a French invasion, but the recruitment campaign was unsuccessful. On 14 July, Gouraud issued an ultimatum to Faisal to demobilize his makeshift Arab Army and recognize France's mandate over Syria. Later in mid-July, French forces broke Hananu's resistance lines in Jisr al-Shughur, capturing the town on their way to Aleppo.|$|E

5|$|Steve Prefontaine {{arrived on}} campus in 1969 and immediately, head coach Bowerman and {{assistant}} coach Bill Dellinger had their hands full to <b>rein</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rebellious new athlete. The bold running style of Prefontaine, front-running, was {{a strategy that}} altered {{the pace of the}} sport. At one point, Prefontaine held every American distance record above the 2,000 meters and was thought of by many {{to be one of the}} greatest American runners in history. Prefontaine had never lost a race longer than a mile during his collegiate career and won a total of seven NCAA championships in track and field and cross country. He raced in the 5000m at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, placing fourth in the race. He died in an automobile accident in Eugene in 1975, at the peak of his career.|$|E
5|$|The people, {{who felt}} the {{severity}} of his laws, {{at the same time}} acknowledged their justice, and found themselves protected from the rapacity of their superiors. Andronikos's energetic efforts to <b>rein</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> oppressive tax collectors and officials of the empire did much to alleviate the lot of the peasantry. However, his efforts to check the power of the nobility were considerably more problematic. The aristocrats were infuriated with him, and to make matters worse, Andronikos seems to have become increasingly deranged; executions and violence became increasingly common, and his reign turned into a reign of terror. Andronikos seemed almost to seek the extermination of the aristocracy as a whole. The struggle against the aristocracy turned into wholesale slaughter, as the emperor resorted to ever more ruthless measures to shore up his regime.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} the Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi allowed the {{emergence}} of the Junior Queen Rajya Laxmi and Crown Prince Surendra onto the political stage. To consolidate her political influence and see her own son, rather than the heir apparent, Surendra, succeed on the throne, Rajya Laxmi had obtained pardon for Sherjung Thapa and other jailed members of Thapa family. It was only after this that Bhimsen Thapa managed to get a symbolic funeral rite in August 1841. Thus, the Nepalese court was split into three factions centered around the King, the Queen, and the Crown Prince. Fateh Jung and his administration supported the King, the Thapas supported the Junior Queen, while the Pandes supported the Crown Prince. The resurgent Thapa coalition succeeded in sowing animosity between Fateh Jung's ministry and the Pande coalition, who were swiftly imprisoned. During his two years in power, Fateh Jung was able to maintain a rule of law in the country; however, after the incarceration of the Pandes, nobody could <b>rein</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> worsening sadistic tendencies, sometimes with fatal consequences, of Surendra, who was then still a minor. Under immense pressure from the Queen and the nobility, along with the backing from army and the general populace, the King in January 1843 handed the highest authority of the state to his Junior Queen, Rajya Laxmi, curtailing both his own and his son's power.|$|E

5|$|Óláfr's {{marriage}} to the daughter of one of Alexander the King of Scots' most trusted northern lords, and the lord's assistance rendered to Óláfr and Páll, may suggest that Óláfr had gained Alexander's approval against Rögnvaldr. In the summer following the defeat of Guðrøðr on Skye, the chronicle states that Óláfr took hostages from the Hebridean portion of the kingdom and, with a fleet of 32 ships, landed on Mann and confronted Rögnvaldr directly. It was then agreed that the kingdom would be split between the two—with Rögnvaldr keeping Mann itself along with the title of king, and Óláfr retaining the Hebridean portions. In the 1220s Alexander began to extend Scottish royal authority into what is today the western coast Scotland, making several expeditions into Argyll. A this time Ruaidrí may have been forced from his lands in Kintyre and replaced by Alexander, installing Domnall mac Ragnaill, a more palatable member of Clann Somairle, in his place. Óláfr's control of Lewis and Skye, bordering the domains of Clann Somairle, may have made him appear as a potentially valuable ally to Alexander's eyes, who wished to <b>rein</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> more dangerous members of Clann Somairle.|$|E

More than a means of transportation, a Dragon Steed can be considered a symbol of status as they are not something that common folk can own, and are only seen ridden by members of the aristocracy or nobility.

25|$|Falun Gong {{initially}} enjoyed considerable {{official support}} {{during the early}} years of its development.

In 1995 authorities mandated that all qigong groups establish Communist Party branches. The government also sought to formalize ties with Falun Gong and exercise greater control over the practice. Falun Gong resisted co-optation, and instead filed to withdraw altogether from the state-run qigong association.|$|E

The Xhosa chiefs generally honoured Stockenström's treaty and returned any cattle that their people had raided. On the Cape side, Stockenström, who saw the major problem as being the land management of the colonists, used his influence to <b>rein</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> frontier settlers and prevent any expansion onto Xhosa land. A level of trust also began to develop, and the Xhosa chiefs came to hold Stockenström in exceptionally high regard as a man who, although he had defeated the Xhosa armies on multiple occasions, nonetheless treated them as diplomatic equals.|$|E

In the summer of 2003, Abdullah threw his considerable weight behind the creation of a national dialogue that brought leading religious figures together, including a highly publicized meeting attended by the kingdom's preeminent Shi'i scholar Hasan al-Saffar, as well as a group of Sunni clerics that had previously expressed their loathing for the Shi'i minority.|$|E
25|$|As {{the civil}} war escalated, Lebanese militias grew {{stronger}} and soon surpassed the regular army. This rapidly undermined {{the authority of the}} central government. The government's ability to maintain order was also handicapped {{by the nature of the}} Lebanese Army. One of the smallest in the Middle East, it was composed based on a fixed ratio of religions. As members defected to sectarian militias, the army would eventually prove unable to contain the militant groups, <b>rein</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> PLO or monitor foreign infiltration. Since the government was Christian-dominated, especially the officers' ranks, trust among Muslims for central institutions, including the army, was low.

50|$|Draw <b>reins</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western riding {{disciplines}} {{are always}} {{attached to the}} rings of the cinch (a western-style girth), usually {{on each side of}} a western saddle, run through the bit rings (either inside to outside or vice versa, there is no firm rule, though the rein moves more smoothly if the inside goes to the girth and the outside to the hand), and then to the hands of the rider. They are rarely used in a two-rein system, usually are used alone or used with the regular bridle reins allowed to lay slack and not held by the rider. While use of the standard draw reins presents only mild controversy in western circles, a controversial use of this <b>rein</b> <b>in</b> western riding is its use on a curb bit, a practice that applies incorrect leverage, is dangerous, and creates an effect that some consider abusive.|$|R
