5|$|By {{the time}} {{exploding}} cigars were being turned out by manufacturers such as Adams and Appel, the chemical explosive variety {{had fallen out}} of favor. According to Adams, the large-scale switch to a non-chemical device occurred in approximately 1915 {{in the aftermath of a}} death caused by a homemade exploding cigar <b>rigged</b> with dynamite. Though exploding cigars were not normally <b>rigged</b> with dynamite but with explosive caps using a less powerful incendiary, following the incident, a number of U.S. states banned the product altogether. The replacement for chemical explosives was a metal spring mechanism, bound with cord—as the victim puffed away, the cord burned through, causing the device to spring open, thus rupturing the cigar's end.|$|E

50|$|The Bermuda <b>rig</b> can {{be split}} into two groups: the {{masthead}} <b>rig</b> and the fractional <b>rig.</b> The masthead <b>rig</b> has larger and more headsails, and a smaller mainsail, compared to the fractional <b>rig.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{intended}} to be <b>rigged</b> as a three-masted schooner, like her half-sisters, but her first captain suggested that her fore- and mainmasts be square <b>rigged</b> to take advantage of her more seaworthy hull form. Kremls masts were hollow iron and were used to ventilate the lower decks, the first such masts in the Imperial Russian Navy. To protect her leadsmen, sailors who determined the depth of water under the keel, in combat, Kreml was fitted with two sounding tubes that led from the gun deck through the bottom of the hull.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} Sea Cloud featured royal-sails over single topgallant- and double top-sails on the fore and mizzen masts. The main mast {{was equipped with}} a royal-sail over double topgallant- and double top-sails. Today the first three masts are <b>rigged</b> with double top-sails, single topgallants, royals and a main skysail.|$|E
5|$|Inverlyon was {{a fishing}} smack of 59 tons burthen {{that was a}} part of the fishing fleet at Lowestoft on the Suffolk coast. The wooden boat had a flush deck, two masts, and no engine. Inverlyons sails were fore-and-aft <b>rigged</b> and may have been red ochre in colour, the {{traditional}} sail colour for British smacks.|$|E
50|$|Small mobile {{drilling}} <b>rigs</b> {{are also}} used to drill or bore piles. <b>Rigs</b> can range from 100 ton continuous flight auger (CFA) <b>rigs</b> to small air powered <b>rigs</b> used to drill holes in quarries, etc. These <b>rigs</b> use the same technology and equipment as the oil drilling <b>rigs,</b> just on a smaller scale.|$|R
50|$|This type of <b>rig</b> is {{commonly}} used in connection with oil and/or natural gas drilling. There are more jackup <b>rigs</b> in the worldwide offshore <b>rig</b> fleet than other type of mobile offshore drilling <b>rig.</b> Other types of offshore <b>rigs</b> include semi-submersibles (which float on pontoon-like structures) and drillships, which are ship-shaped vessels with <b>rigs</b> mounted in their center. These <b>rigs</b> drill through holes in the drillship hulls, known as moon pools.|$|R
50|$|The initial {{standard}} <b>rig</b> {{was made}} by Offshore Spars and was configured with triple spreaders and rod <b>rigging.</b> This was later changed a double spreader <b>rig</b> with wire <b>rigging</b> made by Seldén Mast AB of Sweden, but the Offshore Spars triple spreader <b>rig</b> remained optional. The standard <b>rig</b> was changed to a carbon fiber one in 2004.|$|R

5|$|The middle belt of Nigeria {{is known}} for its {{diversity}} of ethnic groups, including the Pyem, Goemai, and Kofyar. The official population count of each of Nigeria's ethnicities has always remained controversial and disputed as members of different ethnic groups believe the census is <b>rigged</b> to give a particular group (usually believed to be northern groups) numerical superiority.|$|E
50|$|Diamond <b>rigs</b> {{can also}} {{be part of a}} multi-combination <b>rig.</b> Multi-combination <b>rigs</b> are a dual setup <b>rig</b> capable of {{operating}} in either a reverse circulation (RC) and diamond drilling role (though not at the same time). This is a common scenario where exploration drilling is being performed in a very isolated location. The <b>rig</b> is first set up to drill as an RC <b>rig</b> and once the desired metres are drilled, the <b>rig</b> is set up for diamond drilling. This way the deeper metres of the hole can be drilled without moving the <b>rig</b> and waiting for a diamond <b>rig</b> to set up on the pad.|$|R

Impressed by Apollo's performance, he invites him to start his own practice out of Trucy's talent agency.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} probe, The Voyage Home {{required}} no new starship designs. The USS Saratoga, the first Federation starship disabled by the probe, was the USS Reliant model from The Wrath of Khan. The Bird-of-Prey model from The Search for Spock was reused, but ILM built additional sturdy versions for The Voyage Homes action sequences. The {{inside of the}} Bird-of-Prey was represented by a different set than The Search for Spock, but the designers made sure to adhere to a sharp and alien architectural aesthetic. To give the set a smokier, atmospheric look, the designers <b>rigged</b> display and instrumentation lights to be bright enough that they could light the characters, {{rather than relying on}} ambient or <b>rigged</b> lighting. While Paramount had instructed ILM to trash the large Spacedock model created for The Search for Spock, the team had been loath to discard the complicated model and its miles of fiber optic lighting. When The Voyage Home called for the return of Spacedock, ILM had only to reassemble the model from storage.|$|E
50|$|The junk <b>rig</b> is {{a simple}} and {{effective}} <b>rig.</b> The <b>rig</b> contrasts starkly with the Bermuda <b>rig</b> which is prevalent on Western sail boats. In its most traditional form the junk <b>rig</b> is carried on an unstayed mast (i.e. a mast without shrouds or stays, supported only on the step at the keelson and the partners) however standing <b>rigging</b> of some kind is not uncommon.|$|R
50|$|A {{wishbone}} <b>rig</b> {{is a type}} of <b>rigging</b> on sailboats.This <b>rigging</b> is {{most popular}} on heavy two-masted vessels. On a ketch it is called wishbone ketch and is considered a subtype of ketch <b>rigging.</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractAt present, in {{our country}} the main deep {{drilling}} <b>rigs</b> are rotary disk drilling <b>rig,</b> spindle-type drilling <b>rig</b> and full hydraulic motor head drive drilling <b>rig,</b> and most of foreign drilling <b>rig</b> equipment are full hydraulic motor head drive drilling <b>rigs.</b> These <b>rigs</b> have many disadvantages; they cannot meet the demand of deep drilling. As the major breakthroughs {{were made in the}} development of high power permanent magnet frequency conversion motor, it is possible to develop the permanent-magnet motor direct drive top-driving drilling <b>rig,</b> so the efficiency of drilling can be improved. In this paper, the difficulties of deep drilling and existing problems of deep drilling <b>rigs</b> are analyzed, and direct drive permanent magnet motor top-driving drilling <b>rig</b> and its parameters and characteristics are introduced. The development of deep borehole permanent-magnet motor direct drive top-driving drilling <b>rig</b> accords with the requirements of drilling technology development and innovation concept, it is the development direction of deep core drill's renewal, will promote the development of geo-drilling technology...|$|R

40|$|This work {{evaluated}} how {{energy is}} utilized in two-vapor compression refrigeration systems. These two systems were tagged <b>rig</b> a and <b>rig</b> b. <b>Rig</b> a was constructed from a design model; while <b>rig</b> b was assembled from equivalent components {{available in the}} market. Both <b>rigs</b> were of equal capacities (10 kW). The energy usage of these <b>rigs,</b> outside the saturated region – superheated and saturated regions- was compared. Within the experimental limit, <b>rig</b> b required about 20 % energy input than <b>rig</b> a. While in the sub-cool region <b>rig</b> b required 25 % input energy than <b>rig</b> a for optimum performance. Since energy, in the running cost of mechanical refrigeration systems, takes the largest share. It was shown by this study that the running cost can be reduced by: basing the component design on balance points; not encouraging superheating and limiting sub-cooling to between 3 o and 5 oC...|$|R
