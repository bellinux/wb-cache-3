5|$|For anejaculation in SCI, the {{first-line}} {{method for}} sperm retrieval is penile vibratory stimulation (PVS). A high-speed vibrator {{is applied to}} the glans penis to trigger a reflex that causes ejaculation, usually within a few minutes. Reports of efficacy with PVS range from 15–88%, possibly due to differences in vibrator settings and experience of clinicians, as well as level and completeness of injury. Complete lesions strictly above Onuf's nucleus (S2–S4) are <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> PVS in 98%, but complete lesions of the S2–S4 segments are not.|$|E

5|$|A toddler who is {{securely}} {{attached to his}} or her parent (or other familiar caregiver) will explore freely while the caregiver is present, typically engages with strangers, is often visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and is generally happy to see the caregiver return. The extent of exploration and of distress are affected, however, by the child's temperamental make-up and by situational factors as well as by attachment status. A child's attachment is largely influenced by their primary caregiver's sensitivity to their needs. Parents who consistently (or almost always) respond to their child's needs will create {{securely attached}} children. Such children are certain that their parents will be <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> their needs and communications.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{associated}} with depression is <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> alprazolam. Clinical {{studies have shown}} that the effectiveness is limited to 4 months for anxiety disorders. However, the research into antidepressant properties of alprazolam is poor and has only assessed its short-term effects against depression. In one study, some long term, high-dosage users of alprazolam developed reversible depression. In the US, alprazolam is FDA-approved for the management of anxiety disorders (a condition corresponding most closely to the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder) or the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety. In the UK, alprazolam is recommended for the short-term treatment (2–4 weeks) of severe acute anxiety.|$|E

In 1825, he convinced the legislature to fund the creation of the Louisville and Portland Canal on the Falls of the Ohio. The canal opened in 1830, and proved very profitable, so much so that Desha lamented the fact that the state had split the cost of the project – and consequently, its profits – with the federal government and private investors. He also urged state investment in a turnpike joining Maysville to Louisville via Lexington. He advocated using excess money earmarked for education to construct hard-surfaced roads in the state, but the General Assembly was less <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> this suggestion.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Carl was an {{excellent}} sea boat; the ship was <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> commands from the helm and had a moderate turning radius. She was somewhat unbalanced, however, and a 6degree rudder to port was required to keep the ship on a straight course. The ship's crew numbered 33 officers and 498 enlisted men, and while serving as a flagship, the crew was augmented with a command staff of 6 officers and 35 enlisted men. Friedrich Carl carried a number of smaller boats, including a large tender, two launches, a pinnace, two cutters, two yawls, and one dinghy.|$|E

At the onset of each campaign, an issue was added to Milk's public political philosophy.

Although he did not hide {{the fact that he was}} gay, it did not become an issue until his race for the California State Assembly in 1976.

5|$|Many {{commonly}} used antibiotics, such as metronidazole or the macrolides, will greatly increase {{the effect of}} warfarin by reducing the metabolism of warfarin in the body. Other broad-spectrum antibiotics can {{reduce the amount of}} the normal bacterial flora in the bowel, which make significant quantities of vitamin K1, thus potentiating the effect of warfarin. In addition, food that contains large quantities of vitamin K1 will reduce the warfarin effect. Thyroid activity also appears to influence warfarin dosing requirements; hypothyroidism (decreased thyroid function) makes people less <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> warfarin treatment, while hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) boosts the anticoagulant effect. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this effect, including changes in the rate of breakdown of clotting factors and changes in the metabolism of warfarin.|$|E

Negative symptoms appear to contribute more to poor quality of life, functional ability, and the burden on others than positive symptoms do.

5|$|Odin and Ägir {{used the}} same {{transverse}} and longitudinal steel frame construction as the Siegfried-class ships. The ships had eight watertight compartments and a double bottom for about 60% {{of the length of}} the hull. As in the Siegfrieds, a ninth watertight compartment was added when the ships were lengthened. The ships were described as good sea boats; they had gentle motion and were very <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> commands from the helm. The ships lost significant speed in heavy seas, however. The ships had a crew of 20officers and 256 enlisted men, with an additional 6officers and 22men when serving as a flagship. The refit increased crew requirements, to an additional 31sailors normally, and the extra flagship crew increased to 9officers and 34men. The ships carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one pinnace, two cutters, one yawl, and one dinghy.|$|E
5|$|The {{class had}} greatly {{improved}} handling characteristics over the preceding Nassau class. The Helgolands were much better sea boats {{and did not}} suffer from the severe rolling that the Nassaus did. The ships were <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> the helm, and had a tight turning radius, and lost only minimal speed during swells. The ships lost up to 54% of their speed at hard rudder, and would heel up to 7°. For comparison, the earlier Nassaus lost up to 70% speed and held a 12° heel with the rudder hard over.|$|E
5|$|The muscle {{weakness}} and {{increased risk of}} irregular heart beat in TPP result from markedly reduced levels of potassium in the bloodstream. Potassium is not in fact lost from the body, but increased Na+/K+-ATPase activity (the enzyme that moves potassium into cells and keeps sodium in the blood) leads to shift of potassium into tissues, and depletes the circulation. In other types of potassium derangement, the acid-base balance is usually disturbed, with metabolic alkalosis and metabolic acidosis often being present. In TPP, these disturbances are generally absent. Hypokalemia leads to hyperpolarization of muscle cells, making the neuromuscular junction less <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> normal nerve impulses and leading to decreased contractility of the muscles.|$|E

5|$|The {{ships were}} very stable, {{primarily}} because of their wide beam. The ships suffered from only slight pitching and rolling, even in the heavy seas of the North Atlantic. Bismarck and Tirpitz were <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> commands from the helm; they were capable of manoeuvring with rudder deflections as small as 5°. With the rudder completely over, the ships heeled only 3°, but lost up to 65% of their speed. The ships handled poorly at low speeds or when travelling astern. As a result, tugs were necessary in confined areas to avoid collisions or grounding. The ships had a standard crew of 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted sailors. The ships carried smaller boats, including three picket boats, four barges, one launch, two pinnaces, two cutters, two yawls, and two dinghies.|$|E
5|$|With its slender, lithe body, the whitetip reef shark {{specializes in}} wriggling into narrow crevices and {{holes in the}} reef and extracting prey {{inaccessible}} to other reef sharks. Alternatively, it is rather clumsy when attempting to take food suspended in open water. This species feeds mainly on bony fishes, including eels, squirrelfishes, snappers, damselfishes, parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, triggerfishes and goatfishes, as well as octopuses, spiny lobsters, and crabs. The whitetip reef shark is highly <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> the olfactory, acoustic, and electrical cues given off by potential prey, while its visual system is attuned more to movement and/or contrast than to object details. It is especially sensitive to natural and artificial low-frequency sounds in the 25100Hz range, which evoke struggling fish.|$|E
