25|$|The WTO shall {{administer}} Trade Policy <b>Review</b> <b>Mechanism.</b>|$|E
25|$|In January 2007, the African Peer <b>Review</b> <b>Mechanism</b> (APRM) {{draft report}} on South Africa was released. This noted that South Africa had the world's second-highest murder rate, with about 50 {{people a day}} being killed, and that {{although}} serious crime was reported as falling, security analysts said {{that the use of}} violence in robberies, and rape, were more common. Mbeki in response {{said in an interview that}} fears of crime were exaggerated.|$|E
25|$|Transparency. The WTO {{members are}} {{required}} to publish their trade regulations, to maintain institutions allowing for the review of administrative decisions affecting trade, to respond to requests for information by other members, and to notify changes in trade policies to the WTO. These internal transparency requirements are supplemented and facilitated by periodic country-specific reports (trade policy reviews) through the Trade Policy <b>Review</b> <b>Mechanism</b> (TPRM). The WTO system tries also to improve predictability and stability, discouraging the use of quotas and other measures used to set limits on quantities of imports.|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} part of a large scale {{comparison}} of how implementation <b>review</b> <b>mechanisms</b> (IRMs) are used in international environmental agreements. Broadly, IRMs are the means by which data is exchanged and gathered, reviewed and assessed {{in the context of an}} international agreement, and by which problems of compliance and inadequate performance are managed. Here we describe the data protocol that is being used in assembing a database of <b>review</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and explain the rationale behind all the major questions in the protocol. The protocol consists of questions about the general features of agreements as well as more focussed questions concerning: how information relating to national performance and compliance is gathered and disseminated; how that information is assessed; and the means by which the parties and the agreement respond to potential problems of noncompliance and inadequate performance. The database is useful in part because it organizes information about different international environmental agreements into a comparable format and thus aids in the selection of appropriate cases and comparisons for further research. It is also useful because it can aid in the testing of hypotheses about which aspects of international agreements and <b>review</b> <b>mechanisms</b> lead agreements to be more effective. We are now using it for both purposes, in addition to extending the number of cases in the database. To date, over fifty cases have been coded using the protocol. Here we also report some observations and hypotheses derived from working with the data from those cases. These include: 1) a hypothesis that <b>review</b> <b>mechanisms</b> tend to grow as needed to fulfill demand for specific functions; 2) a hypothesis that <b>review</b> <b>mechanisms</b> might help the parties to an agreement address various forms of complexity that arise in negotiating and managing international agreements; 3) a questions as to whether and how often institutions that are formally outside a particular agreement but with competence or power in the issue-area de facto provide the <b>review</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for the agreement; 4) a question as to whether <b>review</b> <b>mechanisms</b> make their largest contribution to effectiveness when the obligations of an agreement are precise or vague; 5) a question as to whether in practice some of the functions of <b>review</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are performed by dispute resolution mechanisms, which tend to be formally created in most international agreements (but appear to be rarely used in environmental agreements). ...|$|R
25|$|One {{avenue of}} {{individual}} appeal from government action {{which continues to}} be important is the custom of xìnfǎng or petitions by citizens to the individuals officials for change. The continuing wide use of xìnfǎng {{reflects the fact that}} many officials are still able to avoid legal sanctions and the underlying avoidance of the legal system, as well as the personal ability of officials to personally intervene to change unjust results. Recently xìnfǎng has been institutionalized to some extent with the central government mandating that every level of administration establish a xìnfǎng office to handle petitions and report them up to high levels. This solution by exertion of personal power clearly goes against the idea of rule of law, and worse, some scholars have noted that xìnfǎng today functions more as an informational collection system for the government than an effective <b>review</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|E
500|$|As a {{legislative}} <b>review</b> <b>mechanism,</b> it plays a [...] "limited quasi Second Chamber" [...] role. It {{has also been}} called [...] "the closest body [...] to a Second Chamber for many years". However, the Council {{has been criticized for}} lacking teeth to act as a real check on potential legislative abuses. As of 2009, the PCMR had not issued an adverse report regarding any piece of legislation referred to it. Nevertheless, it forms part of the statutory framework for the People's Action Party [...] government's internationally lauded efforts in managing minority issues in multiethnic Singapore. Former Deputy Prime Minister S. Jayakumar, formerly a member of the Council, has noted that the PCMR is also a symbol of the paramount importance placed on racial harmony in a world still rife with racial and communal conflict.|$|E
500|$|The PCMR's {{power to}} review and block the passage of Bills is {{regarded}} by some {{as an indication of}} its potential as a second chamber. The Council's functional design, however, makes it only a very weak legislative <b>review</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The Council has no power to investigate alleged breaches of minority rights. The general public has also no right of making their views or complaints known to the Chamber. In addition, the lack of a veto power means that currently the most the Council can do is delay the passage of bills and prompt further parliamentary deliberation of the bills in question. But it has yet to do even this much. On those occasions where the Council might have rightly drawn attention to differentiating measures in proposed Bills, the legislature has pre-empted this by inserting [...] "notwithstanding clauses" [...] in the Constitution. Such clauses declare that laws that contravene a constitutional provision are nevertheless valid.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2007 {{the final}} African Peer <b>Review</b> <b>Mechanism</b> (APRM) report on South Africa, again {{suggested}} {{that there was an}} unacceptably high level of violent crime in the country. President Mbeki said the suggestion of unacceptably high violent crime appeared to be an acceptance by the panel of what he called [...] "a populist view". He challenged some of the statistics on crime, which he noted may have resulted from a weak information base, leading to wrong conclusions. Although rape statistics had been obtained from the South African Police Service, [...] "this only denotes the incidents of rape that were reported, some of which could have resulted in acquittals" [...] Mbeki indicated.|$|E
2500|$|The {{spectrum}} {{property rights}} model is often critiqued for potentially leading to artificial scarcity and the hold-up problem. The hold-up problem {{refers to the}} difficulty in aggregation of the spectrum [...] resources (which would be required for high bandwidth applications), as the individual spectrum owners could ask for very high compensation in return of their contribution. Since spectrum is a scarce finite good, there is a perverse incentive to not use it at all. Participants and existing spectrum owners in the spectrum market can preemptively buy spectrum, then warehouse it to prevent existing or newcomer competitors from utilizing it. The existing spectrum owner's official plans for this warehoused spectrum would be save it for an unknown future use, and therefore not utilize it at all for the foreseeable future. [...] In a partial or incomplete [...] "spectrum as property" [...] regulatory regime, incumbent and grandfathered owners who obtained spectrum under the old cause and merit policy, can obtain windfalls in selling the spectrum they obtained for no cost under the earlier regulatory regime. When a regulatory regime changed to the property model, the original merit and cause guidelines for incumbent and grandfathered users are often removed, and no regulatory <b>review</b> <b>mechanism</b> exists to check if the merit guidelines are still being followed, and if not, revoke the spectrum license from the incumbent spectrum owner and reissue the spectrum to a new user under old merit guidelines or sell the spectrum inline with the new [...] "spectrum as property" [...] policy.|$|E

40|$|Why do bureaucratic {{principals}} appoint {{agents who}} hold different policy views from themselves? We posit an explanation {{based on the}} interplay between two types of agency costs: shirking on information production and policy bias. Principals employ biased agents because they shirk less. This creates an incentive for the principal to use <b>review</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that mitigate the resulting bias in the agents’ decisions. The availability of such <b>review</b> <b>mechanisms</b> encourages principals to employ more extreme agents. We apply the theory to explain various features of the administrative state. In contrast to existing accounts, in our model the use {{by the president of}} ideological bureaucrats at regulatory agencies and centralized regulatory review are complements. The use of bias to mitigate shirking results in an amplification of the swings of regulatory policy and heightens the role of regulatory policy in partisan politics...|$|R

40|$|Increased {{hydrocarbon}} exploitation {{within the}} Arctic combined with recent oil spill disasters {{have increased the}} importance of ensuring the existence of adequate oil and gas regulations. Currently, the only Arctic specific oil and gas regulatory mechanism is the Arctic Offshore Oil and Gas Guidelines (AOOGG) – a soft-law mechanism developed within the Arctic Council. Given the fragileness of the Arctic ecosystem, ensuring that the AOOGG is effective in its goal of protecting the Arctic environment is paramount. Analyzing {{the effectiveness of the}} Council can be done by assessing how it develops state concern, promotes a contractual environment, and builds state capacity. As it is currently structured, the Council’s soft-law framework is ineffective. Lacking compliance and <b>review</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> the Council fails to effectively develop state concern or create a contractual environment. The Council, however, has relatively effective capacity building mechanisms. Improving the effectiveness of the Council would not come from developing binding hard [...] ‐law. Rather improvements can be made through the development of <b>review</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> These would serve to increase state concern for oil and gas regulation in the Arctic, as well as improve the AOOGG. <b>Review</b> <b>mechanisms</b> would further develop the AOOGG’s normative niche, promoting attention to norms that the AOOGG advances. Improvements could also be made by developing a clearing-house of information that could improve the capacity of states to implement and promote oil and gas guidelines. This would promote the dissemination of best available technology...|$|R
