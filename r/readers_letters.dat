40|$|Women's health {{magazines}} {{emerged as}} a new cultural industry {{at the end of}} the twentieth century, representing a commercial application of the “will to health” developing in neoliberal societies. This paper explores recurring discourses in <b>reader</b> <b>letters</b> published between 1997 and 2000 in two Australian health magazines targeting white, middle-class women. Both GoodMedicine and Nature & Health are engaged in a similar cultural politics, tempting their audiences away from the established women's lifestyle, beauty, and fashion publications by representing health magazine content as natural, practical, and generally “good for you. ” <b>Reader</b> <b>letters</b> published in these magazines deploy the discourses of pragmatism, authenticity, and critical engagement as new cultural imperatives for performing the “normal, healthy woman. ” However, they offer little recognition of the social determinants of health, or the connections between individual practice and global biopolitics. <b>Reader</b> <b>letters</b> inscribe both the successes and failures experienced in performing the “will to health,” and have considerable potential to facilitate new ways of negotiating these cultural imperatives...|$|R

5000|$|In late 1987 and 1988, {{a populist}} {{campaign}} started in Serbia against this situation, which it described as untenable.

Popular slogans like [...] "Oh Serbia in three parts, you will be whole again" [...] (Ој Србијо из три дела поново ћеш бити цела, oj Srbijo iz tri dela ponovo ćeš biti cela) caught on.

40|$|The {{international}} {{expansion of}} the US magazine franchise Men’s Health has been achieved with unprecedented success, with thirty one editions now produced in countries as diverse as Italy, South Africa, China, Slovenia and Australia. This paper considers how <b>reader</b> <b>letters</b> to Australian Men’s Health deploy a localised resistance to the discursive imperatives built into the editorial and visual template of the Men’s Health International brand. These imperatives include the obligation to engage in preventive health practices, adopt appropriate social behaviours, buy into luxury consumer markets and craft a physical appearance that approximates new standards of masculine beauty. <b>Reader</b> <b>letters</b> produce a local counterpoint to the global reshaping of media masculinities by defending a nostalgic model of the Australian man as medically disobedient, socially diverse, economically egalitarian and cosmetically authentic...|$|R
5000|$|The {{programme}} was a spoof of boys' comics {{from the}} Empire {{days of the}} 20th century, featuring [...] "Your old chum" [...] the Editor (McGowan) presenting regular features, adventure stories, practical advice, <b>readers</b> <b>letters,</b> etc., complete with advertisements. An enthusiastic young reader (Baynham) could be heard turning (and once accidentally tearing) the pages and occasionally commenting. Much of the humour rested upon anachronistic, politically incorrect attitudes towards such topics as education, class, sex, race, war, and the avuncular, paternalistic style adopted by interwar boys' publications like the Boy's Own Paper in addressing their readers. The reference to whaling in the title was underscored by the illustrated front cover of the magazine, i.e. the opening music/sound effects of the programme.|$|E
50|$|As {{activity}} in the Amstrad world declined, the editorial staff, and subsequently the editorial content, was constantly being reduced and the magazine adopted an increasingly eccentric style, with one edition in particular featuring an eight-page script for a Christmas pantomime. Later on, a double spread review for the 2nd Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles game was split between the review itself and a bizarre transcribed interview between Rod Lawton and Adam Peters (pretending {{to be one of}} the turtles). Peters would usually try and promote his band in some way (he featured on the cover of music orientated issue and had one of his techno-MIDI bands songs on the covertape). The magazine is also notable for pioneering the kind of responses - sometimes dry, sometimes surreal, usually humorous and mildly rude - to <b>readers</b> <b>letters</b> of a form now seen throughout UK gaming magazine culture. These characteristics, for many readers, added to AAs charm.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, when its {{ownership}} {{passed into the}} hands of the familys younger members, a change in political leaning was observed. Worldpress.org lists The Hindu as a left-leaning independent newspaper. Joint managing director N. Murali said in July 2003, [...] "It is true that our readers have been complaining that some of our reports are partial and lack objectivity. But it also depends on reader beliefs." [...] N. Ram was appointed on 27 June 2003 as its editor-in-chief with a mandate to [...] "improve the structures and other mechanisms to uphold and strengthen quality and objectivity in news reports and opinion pieces", authorised to [...] "restructure the editorial framework and functions in line with the competitive environment". On 3 and 23 September 2003, the <b>readers</b> <b>letters</b> column carried responses from readers saying the editorial was biased. An editorial in August 2003 observed that the newspaper was affected by the editorialising as news reporting virus, and expressed a determination to buck the trend, restore the professionally sound lines of demarcation, and strengthen objectivity and factuality in its coverage.|$|E
40|$|In {{her advice}} {{column in the}} bestselling Swiss tabloid "Blick", Marta Emmenegger discussed, between 1980 and 1995, {{intimate}} matters from the <b>reader</b> <b>letters</b> addressed to her. In this paper, I will present some of these letters and ask what position "Dear Marta" has been ascribed by the writers. Knowledge of sexuality might be considered general knowledge, because it refers to problems relevant to all members of society. But although this knowledge is relevant to everybody, experts like "Dear Marta" have become crucial for its production and distribution. Indeed, the development of knowledge of sexuality belongs to a genealogy of sexual discourses as discussed by Michel Foucault. Marta's eminent educating role is frequently asserted in the <b>reader</b> <b>letters.</b> This essay then focuses specifically on the autobiographical part of the <b>reader</b> <b>letters,</b> in which authors retrospectively narrate their life stories. Autobiographical writing implies the production and defence of "knowlegde of oneself", which, moreover, is often dealt with in gender specific ways. Women more frequently than men seem to write in an accusing tone of voice, and their life stories are characterised by gender specific aspects. Women often report on humiliation and violence within intimate relationships, incorporating their experiences into tales of shipwreck. Often, these authors do not even ask for advice, but their letters are accumulative evidence of injustice. In this sense, they might be considered acts of self-assertion...|$|R
