50|$|The Engelberg huller uses steel rollers {{to remove}} the husk. Other types of huller include the disk or cono huller which uses an {{abrasive}} rotating disk to first remove the husk before passing the grain to conical rollers which polish it, this is done repeatedly since other sides of circular side of rice are nut husked. <b>Rubber</b> <b>rollers</b> {{may be used to}} reduce the amount of breakage of the grains, so increasing the yield of the best quality head rice, but the <b>rubber</b> <b>rollers</b> tend to require frequent replacement, which can be a significant drawback.|$|R
50|$|Pinch wheel or {{pinch roller}} {{was the name}} used for the plastic or rubber wheels in an 8-track cartridge, used to guide and align the {{magnetic}} tape. <b>Rubber</b> <b>rollers</b> were known to degrade over time, creating a maintenance issue.|$|R
50|$|Towards {{the bottom}} of the unit there is a large <b>rubber</b> <b>roller</b> ("power roll") that rotates {{continuously}} at a few hundred rpm.

50|$|Ink of {{a second}} color, and the {{thinnest}} viscosity, is then applied {{to the surface of}} the plate with a hard <b>rubber</b> <b>roller,</b> so that it covers the plate in one pass and only transfers onto the highest areas of the plate. Ink of a third color, and a much stiffer consistency, is then applied to the lower areas of the plate with a softer <b>rubber</b> <b>roller.</b> The varying viscosities of the two rolled-on inks prevent them from mixing. A fourth color, of even thinner viscosity, can also be applied at this point. This color is either spread out on a glass plate, which is then pressed against the printing plate so that the ink only adheres to the highest points of the metal plate, or it is applied by a hard roller applied with very little pressure.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "melted" [...] <b>rubber</b> pinch <b>rollers</b> {{that can}} be found in many early 8-Track {{cartridges}} were the result of the rubber not being fully cured.

5000|$|Feed-Roller: This {{actually}} {{is the first}} patented method used in the semi-automatic label dispenser to advance the label forward. The label material is fed over the peeling edge, then through a feed-roller assembly which pinches the label material between a metal roller and a <b>rubber</b> <b>roller.</b> The metal roller is held in place with bushings pressed into aluminum blocks which hinge on a rod supported between two sideframes. The blocks use springs on each side to hold tension against the <b>rubber</b> <b>roller</b> (driven by a motor), and this also holds the tracking of the label material {{to the side of}} the machine with the sensor. Using this method label stock up to 16" [...] width can be advanced and tracked perfectly. The disadvantage/advantage to this method is waste is not collected, but pushed out through the rear of the machine where it can be fed into a trash receptacle.|$|E
50|$|As the 19th century {{closed and}} {{photography}} became popular, many lithographic firms {{went out of}} business. Photoengraving, a process that used halftone technology instead of illustration, became the primary aesthetic of the era. Many printers, including Ira Washington Rubel of New Jersey, were using the low-cost lithograph process to produce copies of photographs and books. Rubel discovered in 1901—by forgetting to load a sheet—that when printing from the <b>rubber</b> <b>roller,</b> instead of the metal, the printed page was clearer and sharper. After further refinement, the Potter Press printing Company in New York produced a press in 1903. By 1907 the Rubel offset press was in use in San Francisco.|$|E
5000|$|A {{program could}} be saved to mylar-based magnetically coated cards (71 mm &times; 9.5 mm), which were fed through the reader by a small {{electric}} motor through a worm gear and <b>rubber</b> <b>roller</b> at a speed of 6 cm/s. [...] The recording area used {{only half of the}} width of the card. While reversing the card to store a second program was possible, it was officially discouraged (unlike in later models such as the HP-67) because {{the other half of the}} card was touched by the rubber wheel during transport, causing extra abrasion. When inserted into an extra slot between the display and the keyboard, the printing on top of the card would correspond to the top row of keys (A - E), which served as shortcuts to the corresponding program entry points.|$|E

5000|$|After {{taking a}} ride with Muntz in a 4-track player-outfitted car, Bill Lear, maker of the Lear Jet, {{modified}} the 4-track technology to create the Stereo 8 cartridge, widely known as the 8-track. Most notably, eight tracks were squeezed onto the same ¼" [...] tape, reducing potential audio quality, but allowing twice as much music to be put onto the same length of tape. The pinch roller was also {{an integral part of}} the 8-track cartridge, although many early <b>rubber</b> <b>rollers</b> would suffer from deterioration because the rubber had not been fully cured. Once this was discovered, all later <b>rubber</b> pinch <b>rollers</b> were [...] "fully cured" [...] (hard) <b>rubber,</b> or plastic <b>rollers</b> (introduced by RCA in 1970) were used instead. Thanks to his connection to Motorola, which made radios for Ford Motors cars, Lear was able to ensure that 8-track players would be included in many Ford cars, and they became popular mainly during the early- to mid-1970s. 4-track tapes gradually faded away and were gone by late 1970, as most people switched to 8-tracks, although players compatible with both 4-track and 8-track tapes were sometimes made. Inexpensive adapters were available that permitted 4-track tapes to be played in 8-track players. The adapter was a <b>rubber</b> pinch <b>roller</b> attached to a small metal plate that would clip into the opening in the 4-track cartridge. 4-track tapes are still in-demand by collectors.|$|R

2500|$|With the {{introduction}} of mass-produced pneumatic tyres by the Dunlop Tyre Company, the use of spoon brakes began to decline, as they tended to quickly wear through the thin casing of the new tyres. [...] This problem led to demands for alternative braking systems. On November 23, 1897, Abram W. Duck of Duck's Cyclery in Oakland, California was granted a patent for his Duck Roller Brake (U.S. Patent 594,234). The duck brake used a rod operated by a lever on the handlebar to pull twin <b>rubber</b> <b>rollers</b> against the front tyre, braking the front wheel.|$|R

40|$|In this study, a {{mechanical}} model {{was introduced to}} analyze the hair wrapping via a contact surface in the yarn formation zone. Worsted and ramie/cotton rovings were then used to produce yarns on an experimental ring frame with and without a delivery <b>rubber</b> <b>roller</b> to validate the theoretical analysis. Yarn properties, including hairiness, unevenness, and tensile properties were tested and {{the results indicated that}} the delivery roller could stop fibers from escaping from the twisting process in the spinning triangle and wrap most of them onto the stem of the yarn. In particular for worsted spinning, yarn unevenness CV, as well as tensile properties, was improved significantly due to an improved arrangement of the worsted strand when using the front delivery <b>rubber</b> <b>roller.</b> However, yarn evenness and tensile properties deteriorated for ramie/cotton yarn spun with a delivery <b>rubber</b> <b>roller.</b> This was mainly because of the high modulus of the ramie/cotton blend strand, as upstream twists were blocked and a weak spinning zone was formed to incur an unexpected drawing. ...|$|E

40|$|The Spar Torus Combination (STC) is {{a typical}} concept which {{consists}} of a spar-type floating wind turbine (FWT) and a torus-shaped wave energy converter (WEC), which utilizes the wind energy and wave energy simultaneously. The STC concept reduces the capital costs and improves the utilization of the ocean energy. The study focuses on the interface between the spar and the torus. According to the previous numerical and experimental studies, the interface is expected to undergo extremely large wave loads. The "roller-guide" interface is designed and established in ABAQUS. Nonlinear local structural modelling of the interface is carried out in this thesis. The WEC is established {{to be connected to}} the spar cylinder with designed rollers and hydraulic supports. <b>Rubber</b> <b>rollers</b> and spring connectors are used to absorb the wave energy so that the contact stress in the interface is not significant.
