Root knot nematodes are the major agricultural pest of wide range of crops worldwide. Chickpea, Cicer arietinum L., family Fabaceae, is a high yielding proteinaceous pulse crop with India being the leading producer. Root knot nematodes {{are one of the}} major biological constraint that reduces per capita yield of this pulse crops. In the present investigation, studies were made to determine the efficacy of different oil cakes viz. Azadirachta indica (Neem), Brassica campestris (Mustard) and Gossypium hirsutum (Cotton). Two doses (50 and 100 g) of each neem, mustard and cotton oil cakes were applied to reduce nematode infestation in chickpea. Results revealed that root gall development due to Meloidogyne incognita were significantly reduced in all the treatments and enhance all the plant growth characters of C. arietinum.

Therefore, the study on clean, effective copper leaching technology has a very important practical significance to <b>reduce</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>hazards</b> of waste print circuit board and resources recycling. Hydrometallurgical is a better technology for recycling copper from waste print circuit boards. In this article, hydrometallurgical copper recovery system is divided into four categories: acid leaching, ammonia - ammonium leaching, chloride leaching, as well as other ways of leaching. The advantages and disadvantages of leaching of copper system are analyzed in the process of copper resource utilization. Studies abound on recycling copper from copper-containing waste with citric acid and other complexing agents as the leaching reagent, but studies on recycling copper from waste print circuit boards are rarely reported, which can be used for reference. The trends of the research are using environmentally friendly reagent as leaching agent, selecting the appropriate leaching solution at a certain temperature and pressure and optimizing the subsequent separation procedure.

New insights permitted by system approaches are now developing. Here, we report the level of pesticide use and the agri-environmental performances of three protection systems of apple orchards surveyed from 2005 to 2008 : (1) conventional, (2) low-input and (3) organic farming. To assess the significance of the cultivar in decreasing pesticide use, these protection systems were combined with three cultivars differing in scab susceptibility: ‘Ariane’ (Vf-resistant), ‘Melrose’ (low-susceptibility) and ‘Golden Delicious’ (susceptible). Thus, nine ‘management × cultivar’ apple orchard systems were assessed. The level of pesticide use was the highest in conventional ‘Golden Delicious’ and in ‘Golden Delicious’ plots whatever the protection system. A 43 – 56 % decrease in pesticide use was observed in ‘Ariane’ and ‘Melrose’ in both low-input and organic farming protection systems compared to conventional ‘Golden Delicious’ as reference. Only low-input ‘Melrose’ and low-input ‘Ariane’ systems achieved a level of yield and fruit damages similar to the corresponding conventional cultivars under reduced pesticide use, also permitting <b>reduced</b> <b>environmental</b> impacts.

40|$|Grape {{is one of}} the world's largest fruit crops with {{approximately}} 67. 5 million tonnes produced each year and energy is an important element in modern grape productions as it heavily depends on fossil and other energy resources. Efficient use of these energies is a necessary step toward <b>reducing</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>hazards,</b> preventing destruction of natural resources and ensuring agricultural sustainability. Hence, identifying excessive use of energy as well as reducing energy resources is the main focus of this paper to optimize energy consumption in grape production. In this study we use a two-stage methodology to find the association of energy efficiency and performance explained by farmers' specific characteristics. In the first stage a non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis is used to model efficiencies as an explicit function of human labor, machinery, chemicals, FYM (farmyard manure), diesel fuel, electricity and water for irrigation energies. In the second step, farm specific variables such as farmers' age, gender, level of education and agricultural experience are used in a Tobit regression framework to explain how these factors influence efficiency of grape farming. The result of the first stage shows substantial inefficiency between the grape producers in the studied area while the second stage shows that the main difference between efficient and inefficient farmers was in the use of chemicals, diesel fuel and water for irrigation.
