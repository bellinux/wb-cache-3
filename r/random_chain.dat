50|$|The {{formation}} of multiple native disulfides {{remains one of}} the primary challenges of native peptide synthesis by solid-phase methods. <b>Random</b> <b>chain</b> combination typically results in several products with nonnative disulfide bonds. Stepwise {{formation of}} disulfide bonds is typically the preferred method, and performed with thiol protecting groups. Different thiol protecting groups provide multiple dimensions of orthogonal protection. These orthogonally protected cysteines are incorporated during the solid-phase synthesis of the peptide. Successive removal of these groups, to allow for selective exposure of free thiol groups, leads to disulfide formation in a stepwise manner. The order of removal of the groups must be considered so that only one group is removed at a time. Using this method, Kiso and coworkers reported the first total synthesis of insulin in 1993.|$|E

The first one is the usual <b>random</b> <b>chain,</b> where the coupling constants are uncorrelated random variables, while the second one is a random dimer model in which the coupling constants appear in pairs. Performing an exact numerical diagonalization of the Hamiltonian, we show the existence of spin pairs which violate the Bell inequality, with the probability of finding such pairs increasing with the degree of randomness. In addition, we determine the minimum degree of randomness required for nonlocality and entanglement between spin pairs, and also find the largest possible separation between them. We show that, for the usual <b>random</b> <b>chain,</b> there are entangled and nonlocal spin pairs which can be arbitrarily far from each other. Whereas, for the random dimer case, the largest separation is $ 9 $ lattice spacings for entanglement and $ 1 $ lattice spacing for the violation of the Bell inequality.

To study the kinetics of polymerization, Conversion, molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) were monitored during polymerization to investigate the reaction kinetics. According to the results, adding nanoparticles causes no considerable change in the kinetic curves, while there is an optimum value for nanoparticles loading in which the monomer conversion and molecular weight reaches to its maximum level. However, increasing silica content resulted {{in an increase in}} PDI values. In comparison with free radical polymerization, monomer conversion and molecular weight were lower for RAFT polymerization. The prepared samples were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis (DMTA), and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC).

40|$|With {{nitrocellulose}} stabilizers {{must be used}} {{to prevent}} it against the autocatalytic decomposition. However, the slow intrinsic decomposition cannot be prevented and therefore a slow degradation happens always, which leads to stabilizer consumption and the scissioning of the NC chains. The last effect means molar mass degradation of NC. Both phenomena are irresolvable coupled. In splitting-off the NO 2 radical from the nitrate ester groups RCO-NO 2 the remaining radical function written as RC-O stabilizes itself by molecular rearrangement of the anhyroglucopyranose ring and by splitting-off stable small molecular species. This means molar mass degradation happens by destruction of chain units and not be mere bond scissioning between chain units. This is {{in accordance with the}} well observed phenomena of mass loss with NC [...] To model the stabilizer consumption correctly, the production of NOx by NC has to be regarded as well as the bimolecular reaction between NOx and the stabilizer. The preceding production of NOx from NC is explicitly included, because the concentration of it is not constant with time. The elaboration of this relatively simple reaction scheme ends up in an equation for the bimolecular stabilizer reaction. The model contains both reaction rate constants of the two reactions of the scheme, which is a general and necessary condition for correct modelling of stabilizer consumption. Molar mass decrease of NC caused by <b>random</b> <b>chain</b> scission is describable with models based on the averaged characterizing parameters of the molar mass distribution (MMD) functions. The correct distribution function in terms of reaction kinetics is the one which counts the numbers (or mols) of polymers in the molar mass fraction M+dM.

40|$|We study dimer {{coverings}} on <b>random</b> multiple <b>chains.</b> A {{multiple chain}} is a planar honeycomb lattice constructed by successively fusing {{copies of a}} 'straight' condensed hexagonal chain {{at the bottom of}} the previous one in two possible ways. A <b>random</b> multiple <b>chain</b> is then generated by admitting the Bernoulli distribution on the two types of fusing, which describes a zeroth-order Markov process. We determine the expectation of the number of the pure dimer coverings (perfect matchings) over the ensemble of <b>random</b> multiple <b>chains</b> by the transfer matrix approach. Our result shows that, with only two exceptions, the average of the logarithm of this expectation (i. e., the annealed entropy per dimer) is asymptotically nonzero when the fusing process goes to infinity and the length of the hexagonal chain is fixed, though it is zero when the fusing process and the length of the hexagonal chain go to infinity simultaneously. Some numerical results are provided to support our conclusion, from which we can see that the asymptotic behavior fits well to the theoretical results. We also apply the transfer matrix approach to the quenched entropy and reveal that the quenched entropy of <b>random</b> multiple <b>chains</b> has a close connection with the well-known Lyapunov exponent of random matrices.
