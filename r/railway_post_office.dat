5|$|Berkshire Division service {{began to}} decline before World War II, when {{increased}} automobile availability reduced the appeal of travel by train. The line had always used the oldest equipment on the railroad, and all trains except one weekly round trip lost their parlor cars in 1940 and 1942. In January 1960, profitable <b>railway</b> <b>post</b> <b>office</b> service was ended due to unsuitable schedules, and starting in March 1960 all trains except two weekend through round trips were run by single Budd RDCs and truncated to Danbury where passengers could change for local trains to New York. In November 1960, the New Haven moved its station services from Union Station to a converted freight house slightly to the east to save money, leaving the B alone in the station. In March 1964, the Interstate Commerce Commission authorized the NYNH to cut all Berkshire Division services except the weekend trips.|$|E
5|$|In mid-August Pilecki's Company {{occupied}} the insurgent stronghold in the <b>Railway</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> {{connected to the}} Warszawa Gda≈Ñska station. Here again {{he and his men}} would hold out against frequent German attempts to dislodge them. Pilecki would keep this position in insurgent hands for six weeks and was ejected only after a specialized German task force was brought in and drove the partisans out using flame throwers and explosives. After the capitulation of the uprising, Pilecki hid a cache of weapons in a private apartment and surrendered to the Wehrmacht on October 5, 1944. He was imprisoned at Stalag VIII-B, a German prisoner-of-war camp near Lamsdorf, Silesia. He was later transferred to Oflag VII-A in Murnau, Bavaria where he was liberated by troops of the US 12th Armored Division on April 28, 1945.|$|E

In addition, the U.S. runs a Boat <b>Railway</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Offices.</b> The boat services were first available for inland waterways, beginning in 1857, and subsequently ocean routes to Puerto Rico, Canal Zone, and from Seattle to Alaska. The rail and boat offices were discontinued in 1977 and 1978, respectively.|$|R

25|$|A {{passenger}} car (known {{as a coach}} or carriage in the UK, and {{also known as a}} bogie in India) is a piece of railway rolling stock that is designed to carry passengers.

This provided important revenue. The PE was responsible for an innovation in grade crossing safety: the automatic electromechanical grade crossing signal, nicknamed the wigwag.

25|$|After {{extensive}} trackwork was planned, the Aurora Branch {{changed its}} name to the Chicago and Aurora Railroad in June 1852, and to Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad in 1856, and shortly reached its two other namesake cities, Burlington, Iowa and Quincy, Illinois. In 1868 CB completed bridges over the Mississippi River both at Burlington, Iowa, and Quincy, Illinois giving the railroad through connections with the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad (B) in Iowa and the Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad (H) in Missouri. The first <b>Railway</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> was inaugurated on the H to sort mail on the trains way across Missouri, passing the mail to the Pony Express upon reaching the Missouri River at St. Joseph, Missouri.|$|E

50|$|To cover long distances, the <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> used a {{hub-and-spoke}} system, with Washington as the hub {{and chief}} sorting center. By 1869, with 27,000 local <b>post</b> <b>offices</b> to deal with, it had changed to sorting mail en route in specialized railroad mail cars, called <b>Railway</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Offices,</b> or RPOs.

25|$|The {{principal}} mainline railroads concentrated {{their efforts}} on moving freight and passengers over long distances. But many had suburban services near large cities, which might also be served by Streetcar and Interurban lines. The Interurban was an almost uniquely North American concept which relied almost exclusively on passenger traffic for revenue. Unable to survive the Great Depression, the failure of most Interurbans by that time left many cities without suburban passenger railroads, although the largest cities such as New York, Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia continued to have suburban service. The major railroads passenger flagship services included multi-day journeys on luxury trains resembling hotels, which were unable to compete with airlines in the 1950s. Rural communities were served by slow trains no more than twice a day. They survived until the 1960s because the same train hauled the <b>Railway</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> cars, {{paid for by the}} US Post Office. RPOs were withdrawn when mail sorting was mechanized.|$|E
500|$|The train's {{engineer}} {{sat in a}} small compartment in {{the nose}} of the train, {{directly in front of the}} prime mover. Behind the engine in the first carbody was a [...] long <b>railway</b> <b>post</b> <b>office</b> section. The second carbody consisted of a small baggage section and a short buffet and 20-passenger coach section. The third and final carbody in the train, as originally built, was configured as half coach (40-passenger seats) and half observation car (12 passenger seats). As built, the train had 72 seats and could carry 50,000 pounds (22.7 tonnes) of baggage and express freight. This train's official christening occurred on April 18, 1934, at the Pennsylvania Railroad's Broad Street Station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.|$|E

The last route with a <b>railway</b> <b>post</b> <b>office</b> title {{was actually a}} boat run that lasted a year longer. This Boat <b>Railway</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> was the Lake Winnipesaukee RPO operating between The Weirs, New Hampshire, and Bear Island on Lake Winnipesaukee.
