5|$|Gage soon {{dismissed}} Hancock {{from his}} post as colonel of the Boston Cadets. In October 1774, Gage canceled the scheduled meeting of the General Court. In response, the House resolved itself into the Massachusetts Provincial Congress, a body independent of British control. Hancock was elected {{as president of the}} Provincial Congress and was a key member of the Committee of Safety. The Provincial Congress created the first minutemen companies, consisting of militiamen who were to be <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>action</b> on a moment's notice.|$|E
5|$|On 28 April 1941, {{the ship}} and crew were ready, and stores were on board for a three-month mission. Lindemann {{notified}} Naval High Command (Oberkommando der Marine), Naval Groups North and West (Marinegruppen Nord und West) and Fleet Command that Bismarck was <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>action.</b> The Chief of Fleet—Admiral Günther Lütjens—and his fleet staff held drills {{for the first time}} on board Bismarck on 13 May, testing the communication chain between Fleet Command and Bismarcks officers.|$|E
50|$|Huáscar {{participated in}} the 1891 Chilean Civil War between {{government}} and congress. Undergoing major maintenance work {{at the onset of}} the war, she was seized and towed out of Valparaíso by the rebel-leaning Navy, and <b>readied</b> <b>for</b> <b>action</b> within three days.|$|R
50|$|While she {{was being}} <b>readied</b> <b>for</b> <b>action,</b> the Navy again changed its plans for the vessel and sent her to {{the western part of}} the Gulf of Mexico where Flag Officer David Farragut was {{preparing}} for his daring attack on New Orleans, Louisiana.|$|R

5|$|The Stockport, Bolton and Rochdale Volunteers were {{reviewed}} on Kersal Moor on 25 August 1797 and in June 1812, 30,000 {{troops from the}} Wiltshire, Buckinghamshire, Louth and Stirling regiments were camped there <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>action</b> to suppress the Luddites. In 1818 a protest meeting was held on the moor by coal miners to publicise their case for better pay, because of the dangers they faced at work.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} invasion threat passed, but {{the castle}} was reinforced in 1558, due to fresh concerns of a French attack. Around 1570, the main bastions {{were filled with}} earth, probably to allow heavier guns to be mounted on them, and Queen Elizabeth I inspected the castle in 1573. The defences along the coast were mobilised in 1588 {{in response to the}} threat posed by the Spanish armada, and were probably kept <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>action</b> throughout the rest of Elizabeth's reign.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{returned}} to Massachusetts in November 1774, {{where he served}} in the Massachusetts Provincial Congress, an extralegal legislative body independent of British control. The Provincial Congress created the first minutemen companies, consisting of militiamen who were to be <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>action</b> on a moment's notice. Adams also served as moderator of the Boston Town Meeting, which convened despite the Massachusetts Government Act, and was appointed to the Committee of Inspection to enforce the Continental Association. He was also selected to attend the Second Continental Congress, scheduled to meet in Philadelphia in May 1775.|$|E
5000|$|Point Countess was {{stationed}} at Bellingham, Washington from 1962 to 1965. In 1966 and 1967, she {{was stationed}} at Everett, Washington. Point Countess was painted gray in 1967 and <b>readied</b> <b>for</b> <b>action</b> in Vietnam {{in support of}} Operation Market Time. At the last minute she was ordered to relieve the [...] at Port Angeles, Washington. She was stationed at Port Angeles from 1968 to 1988.|$|R
50|$|After the Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor 7 December 1941, John D. Ford <b>readied</b> <b>for</b> <b>action</b> at Cavite {{as a unit}} of DesDiv 59. Undamaged by the {{destructive}} Japanese air raid on Manila Bay 10 December, she sailed southward the same day to patrol the Sulu Sea and Makassar Strait with Task Force 6. She remained in Makassar Strait until 23 December, then she steamed from Balikpapan, Borneo, to Surabaya, Java, arriving the 24th.|$|R

5|$|Blücher {{spent most}} of November 1939 fitting out and {{finishing}} additional improvements. By {{the end of the}} month, the ship was ready for sea trials; she steamed to Gotenhafen in the Baltic Sea. The trials lasted until mid-December, after which the ship returned to Kiel for final modifications. In January 1940, she resumed her exercises in the Baltic, but {{by the middle of the}} month, severe ice forced the ship to remain in port. On 5 April, she was deemed to be <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>action,</b> and was therefore assigned to the forces participating in the invasion of Norway.|$|E
5|$|Both vessels were {{involved}} in the operations off Lissa in July 1866, but neither took part in the Battle of Lissa on 20 July. Formidabile had been damaged by Austrian coastal fortifications the day before, and had withdrawn for repairs; Terribile was <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>action,</b> but had been preparing to attack Lissa and was too far south to {{take an active role in}} the battle. Both ships saw minimal use in the 1870s and 1880s, until both were withdrawn from service for use as training ships. Formidabile and Terribile served in this capacity until 1903 and 1904, respectively, when they were sold and broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|By mid-March, the Prussian {{ships were}} <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>action</b> {{and the ice}} had receded far enough that Prince Adalbert ordered Jachmann to conduct a {{reconnaissance}} of the blockading force on 16 March. In the meantime, Dockum's squadron had arrived off Swinemünde two days before. Arcona and Nymphe patrolled off Greifswald, but the weather was very poor, with snow showers hampering visibility. The Prussian gunboats, led by the paddle steamer , remained closer to Swinemünde. Jachmann spotted three vessels at around 15:30, but {{there was not enough}} time before dark to catch them. Instead, Jachmann turned back to Swinemünde, intending to try again the following day.|$|E
50|$|The {{walls of}} Copenhagen {{bristled}} with about 300 pieces of cannon, mortars and other artillery, while a diverse mixture of weapons, ranging from muskets and arquebuses to morningstars, scythes, {{boiling water and}} tar had been <b>readied</b> <b>for</b> <b>action.</b> Craftsmen, students and other civilians were divided into nine companies, and each of these companies was allocated {{a part of the}} wall to defend. The professional soldiers were stationed at the outer field works, Kastellet (the Citadel) and Slotsholmen (the Castle Islet).|$|R

60|$|Erling's foot-boy saw {{the whole}} of this, and heard what followed, for the curtain of the tent was raised; but he moved neither hand nor foot, though he held a spear <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> instant <b>action</b> if required.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{destruction}} of the Armada, the Spanish threat continued; the castles in Kent were kept <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>action</b> throughout the rest of Elizabeth's reign. In 1596 a Spanish invasion fleet carrying reportedly 20,000 soldiers set out for Pendennis, which was then garrisoned with only 500 men. The fleet was forced to turn back due to bad weather, but Elizabeth reviewed the defences and significantly expanded Henry's original fortifications with more up-to-date bastions, designed by the engineer Paul Ive. By the end of the century, however, most of the Device Forts were typically out of date by European standards.|$|E
5|$|Johns relinquished his {{roles in}} Papua and resumed his former post at USASOS in March 1943, being {{replaced}} by Brigadier General Hanford MacNider. In turn, he replaced MacNider as GHQ Coordinator, Milne Bay in October 1943. As such, {{he was responsible for}} all logistical activities at what was now the major US base in Papua-New Guinea. On 15 December 1943, he became Coordinator, Finschhafen. Finschhafen was destined to become the new hub of US activity in Papua-New Guinea; but an enormous amount of work was required to get the base <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>action.</b> For his service in New Guinea, Johns was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E
5|$|The air {{groups of}} the sisters were {{decimated}} in the battle, which forced Zuikaku to return to Japan with Shōkaku for resupply and aircrew training, and neither carrier {{was able to take}} part in the Battle of Midway in June. En route to Japan, Shōkaku was caught in a severe storm and nearly capsized as the weight of the water used to put out the fires had compromised her stability. Repairs took three months and she was not <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>action</b> until late August.|$|E
5|$|In Lithuania, Commonwealth Lithuanian Army {{numbered}} about 15,000, with {{an additional}} Crown detachment of about 3,000. They were commanded by Duke Louis of Württemberg. Württemberg made no plans for the war, and the troops were not <b>readied</b> <b>for</b> <b>action</b> {{by the time the}} war started. The Russian army in that theatre under General Mikhail Krechetnikov was 33,700 strong or 38,000 strong. The Russian army was also divided into four corps: 1st under one of Targowica Confederate leaders, Szymon Kossakowski 7,300 strong, 2nd under General Boris Mellin, 7,000 strong, 3rd under General Yuri Dolgorukov, 15,400 strong, and 4th under General Ivan Fersen, 8,300 strong.|$|R
50|$|On 25 June 1950, {{communist}} North Korea {{launched an}} invasion of South Korea. The United Nations Security Council {{taking advantage of the}} Soviet boycott decided to provide military assistance to South Korea against the aggressor. The United States took on the majority of the responsibility for carrying out the Security Council's operations, particularly with regard to naval forces. That required the reactivation of many ships in the Reserve Fleet. Weiss was moved out of her berth at Green Cove Springs, quickly <b>readied</b> <b>for</b> <b>action,</b> and recommissioned on 14 October 1950, with Lieutenant Commander W. H. Bargeloh in command.|$|R
60|$|Ian {{replied to}} both remarks by saying that, whether black or blue, they {{must make the}} best of it, and set about doing that at once. To do his desponding comrades justice, they were quite <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> {{vigorous}} <b>action</b> in any form, notwithstanding their despair.|$|R
5|$|After Charles II was {{restored}} to the throne in 1660, he began a wide-ranging programme of work on the coastal defences. The Dutch fleet then attacked up the Thames in June 1667, but were deterred from going further for fear of the Tilbury and Gravesend fortifications. In reality, the forts were poorly prepared to resist a Dutch attack; at Tilbury {{there were only two}} guns <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>action.</b> The Dutch struck the English fleet at Medway instead, giving enough time for the government to improve the defences along the Thames and mount 80 guns on the forts. In the wake of the conflict, the King instructed his Chief Engineer, a Dutchman called Sir Bernard de Gomme, to develop Tilbury Fort's defences further.|$|E
5|$|Army Group Centre renewed their {{offensive}} on Moscow in mid-November. Fegelein and the SS Cavalry Brigade {{were held}} back as an operational reserve in the rearward {{area of the}} 9th Army. Massive counter-attacks by the Red Army led to a weakening of the entire German line, and the brigade {{was called in to}} fight at the front on 28 December. While Fegelein reported that his forces were the equivalent to one or two divisions, in reality he had only 4,428 men in total at this point, of which 1,800 were <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>action.</b> The brigade was deployed at the south-eastern sector of the XXIII Army Corps, where it defended against attacks in the rearward area of the 206th Infantry Division in the Battles of Rzhev. The SS Cavalry Brigade took serious losses, with casualties of up to 60 per cent in some squadrons.|$|E
5|$|During the war, {{the castle}} was {{involved}} in an armed stand-off with French naval vessels. After the Fall of France in 1940, some of the French ships had {{made their way to}} British ports, including Portsmouth, but fears rose that the warships might leave and fall into German hands. On 23 June, the castle was ordered to man its guns and to be prepared to fire on the French navy to prevent their departure; one gun, albeit not <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>action,</b> was levelled at the fleet and the French destroyer Léopard responded by aiming its guns at the castle, but no shooting ensued. On 3 July, under Operation Grasp, British forces boarded and seized the ships, ending the confrontation.|$|E

5000|$|Theseus {{played a}} less {{successful}} {{role in the}} 1799 Siege of Acre, {{under the command of}} Captain Ralph Willett Miller. On 13 May 1799 she reached the nearby port of Caesarea, and Miller ordered the ship <b>readied</b> <b>for</b> <b>action</b> in bombarding Acre the following morning. A large quantity of ammunition was brought to the deck for use by the ships guns, including more than 70 18-pound and 36-pound shells. At 9.30am on the 14th, the ammunition was accidentally ignited while the ship was under way. The resulting explosion set fire to the deck, main and mizzen masts and killed Miller and 25 other men. Another 45 crew members were injured.|$|R
50|$|In {{the night}} of September 1/2, 1939, at app. 1 a.m., General Roman Abraham, who {{commanded}} Wielkopolska Cavalry Brigade, ordered a platoon of military cyclists (see Bicycle infantry), stationed in Krzywin, to come to Leszno. The cyclists, under Colonel Zbigniew Baranski, were told to get <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> an <b>action.</b>|$|R
5|$|Ernst Lindemann was {{frustrated}} by the fact that—as commander of the Naval Gunnery School—he would never come into {{direct contact with the}} enemy. When he received the news that he had been selected to be the first commander of the battleship , he was honoured by the trust that had been bestowed on him but doubted that {{he would be able to}} get Bismarck <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>action</b> before the war was over. His doubts suggest that he was confident the war would end in a favourable outcome for Germany by mid-1940. Prior to commanding Bismarck, Lindemann had never held any shipboard command, a situation rare if not unique in the Kriegsmarine. Nevertheless, Lindemann had served exclusively on ships with a gun calibre of at least , and he was Germany's leading gunnery expert. In 1940, he ranked second out of Crew 1913 and was considered an outstanding leader.|$|E
5|$|Only 100 of the 2,400 tons of {{supplies}} {{scheduled to be}} landed on D-Day were landed. An accurate figure for casualties incurred by V Corps at Omaha on 6 June is not known; sources vary between 2,000 and 4,700 killed, wounded, and missing, with the heaviest losses incurred by the infantry, tanks and engineers in the first landings. Only five tanks of the 741st Tank Battalion were <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>action</b> the next day. The German 352nd division suffered 1,200 killed, wounded and missing; about 20% of its strength. Its deployment at the beach caused such problems that Lieutenant General Omar Bradley, commander of the U.S. First Army, at one stage considered evacuating Omaha, while Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery considered the possibility of diverting V Corps forces through Gold.|$|E
5|$|She was recommissioned {{for service}} on 31 March 1941, {{after which the}} Kriegsmarine {{initially}} planned to send the ship on the commerce raiding operation planned the previous year. Her sister Admiral Scheer was to join Lützow for the operation, and on 12 June, she departed for Norway with an escort of destroyers. British torpedo bombers attacked the ship off Egersund and scored a single hit that disabled her electrical system and rendered the ship motionless. She took on a severe list to port and the port shaft was damaged. The crew effected emergency repairs that allowed her to return to Germany; repair work in Kiel lasted for six months. By 10 May 1942, the ship was finally pronounced <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>action.</b>|$|E
60|$|Gotsuchakoff was {{too well}} used to war's alarms {{to give way}} to {{unreasonable}} curiosity. He instantly perceived that the scout required of him the utmost circumspection for some reason or other, and, in the spirit of a true soldier, awaited orders in total silence, <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> prompt <b>action.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Americans {{sent the}} {{captured}} military stores away on May 2 but were then penned in York harbour by a gale. They left York on May 8, in miserable weather, and required {{a period of}} rest at Fort Niagara on the Niagara peninsula before they could be <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> another <b>action.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{first part}} of the night passed quietly. Double sentries were placed at each of the angles of the walls.
