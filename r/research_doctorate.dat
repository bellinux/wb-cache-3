25|$|In German {{language}}-speaking countries, {{the word}} Doktor {{refers to a}} <b>research</b> <b>doctorate</b> awardee in formal language (similar to a PhD), and is distinct from Arzt, a medical practitioner, though colloquial {{use of the word}} Doktor for physician is common.|$|E
25|$|The Doctor of Business Administration (abbreviated DBA, D.B.A., DrBA, or Dr.B.A.) is a <b>research</b> <b>doctorate</b> awarded on {{the basis}} of {{advanced}} study and research in the field of business administration.

25|$|In Finland, {{the title}} of tohtori or doktor denotes holder of a <b>research</b> <b>doctorate</b> {{comparable}} to a PhD. Until recent years it was customary to first become licentiate (after the master's degree), which meant persons becoming doctors already had had quite a long academic career. Nowadays doctorate programs are available after the master's degree in many fields and becoming doctor at young age is much more common.|$|E
25|$|Oliver {{began his}} {{research}} career whilst a registrar at St Thomas' Hospital in London. He gained his <b>research</b> <b>doctorate</b> from the University of London in 2001. He was a Senior Lecturer in the School of Health and Social {{care at the}} University of Reading from 2004 to 2009 alongside his consultant contract at the Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust. He {{has been involved with}} City University London. He is a visiting Professor at the University of Surrey.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Research</b> <b>doctorates</b> {{are awarded}} in {{recognition}} of academic research that is publishable, at least in principle, in a peer-reviewed academic journal. The best-known research degree title, in the English-speaking world, is Doctor of Philosophy (abbreviated Ph.D., PhD or, at some British universities, DPhil) awarded in many countries throughout the world. Other <b>research</b> <b>doctorates</b> include the Doctor of Education (Ed.D. or EdD), Doctor of Arts (D.A.), Doctor of Musical Arts (D.M.A.), Doctor of Professional Studies/Professional Doctorate (ProfDoc or DProf), Doctor of Public Health (Dr.P.H.), Doctor of Social Science (D.S.Sc. or DSocSci), Doctor of Business Administration (D.B.A. [...] or DBA), the UK Doctor of Management (DMan), various doctorates in engineering, such as the US Doctor of Engineering (D.Eng., D.E.Sc. or D.E.S.) (also awarded in Japan and South Korea), the UK Engineering Doctorate (EngD), the Dutch Professional Doctorate in Engineering (PDEng), the German engineering doctorate Doktor-Ingenieur (Dr.-Ing.) and the German natural science doctorate Doctor rerum naturalium (Dr.rer.nat.). The UK Doctor of Medicine (MD or MD (Res)) and Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) can be <b>research</b> <b>doctorates.</b> The Doctor of Theology (Th.D., D.Th. or ThD), Doctor of Practical Theology (DPT) and the Doctor of Sacred Theology (S.T.D., or D.S.Th.) are <b>research</b> <b>doctorates</b> in theology.|$|R

25|$|The law in France {{allows the}} title of Dr to be used professionally by the above medical {{professionals}} and by holders of research doctorates, with the field of their speciality being mentioned after the name. The courts have ruled that stating the specialisation is not necessary except in circumstances specifically related to professional practice; at other times the title alone may be used. The courts have also determined that questioning {{the right of the}} holder of a <b>research</b> <b>doctorate</b> to use the title Dr is a form of libel. The National Union of Hospital Scientists (Syndicat National des Scientifiques Hospitaliers) launched a campaign in 2015 to raise awareness of the right of scientists to use the title.|$|E
25|$|Bakhtin {{completed}} {{his book on}} Rabelais (titled Rabelais in the History of Realism) in 1940. After several attempts to get the book published fell through, it was submitted as a dissertation for the Candidate of Sciences degree at the Gorky Institute of World Literature in Moscow. At the dissertation's defense in 1946, all three official opponents {{were in favor of}} awarding Bakhtin a higher doctoral degree: the Doctor of Sciences, and their motion was accepted with a narrow majority vote. However, following an assault on the institute published in the press at the time, and after six years of repeated revisions and deliberations, USSR's VAK decided Bakhtin would only receive the Candidate of Sciences degree (roughly equivalent to a <b>research</b> <b>doctorate).</b> The book was eventually published in Russian in 1965, under the title Rabelais and Folk Culture of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Its 1968 English translation by Hélène Iswolsky was given the title, Rabelais and His World.|$|E

5000|$|A {{distinction}} is drawn in the US between professional doctorates and [...] "doctor's degree - research/scholarship", {{with the latter}} being [...] "a Ph.D. or other doctor's degree that requires advanced work beyond the master's level, including the preparation and defense of a dissertation based on original research, or the planning and execution of an original project demonstrating substantial artistic or scholarly achievement." [...] Internationally, US professional <b>doctorates</b> (which, unlike <b>research</b> <b>doctorates,</b> are not defined as requiring work beyond the master's level) are not {{generally considered to be}} doctoral level qualifications. The classification of [...] "Doctor's degree - other" [...] also exists for doctorates that do not meet the definition of either professional <b>doctorates</b> or <b>research</b> <b>doctorates.</b>|$|R
25|$|After the {{amputation}} {{of his leg}} in 1938, Bakhtin’s health {{improved and}} he became more prolific. In 1940, and {{until the end of}} World War II, Bakhtin lived in Moscow, where he submitted a dissertation on François Rabelais to the Gorky Institute of World Literature to obtain a postgraduate title, a dissertation that could not be defended until the war ended. In 1946 and 1949, the defense of this dissertation divided the scholars of Moscow into two groups: those official opponents guiding the defense, who accepted the original and unorthodox manuscript, and those other professors who were against the manuscript’s acceptance. The book's earthy, anarchic topic was the cause of many arguments that ceased only when the government intervened. Ultimately, Bakhtin was denied a higher doctoral degree (Doctor of Sciences) and granted a lesser degree (Candidate of Sciences, a <b>research</b> <b>doctorate)</b> by the State Accrediting Bureau. Later, Bakhtin was invited back to Saransk, where he took on the position of chair of the General Literature Department at the Mordovian Pedagogical Institute. When, in 1957, the Institute changed from a teachers' college to a university, Bakhtin became head of the Department of Russian and World Literature. In 1961, Bakhtin’s deteriorating health forced him to retire, and in 1969, in search of medical attention, Bakhtin moved back to Moscow, where he lived until his death in 1975.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{the title}} of [...] "Doktor" [...] is granted to {{physicians}} (Dr. med. univ.) and dentists (Dr. med. dent.), which do not technically possess doctorate degrees, but Diplom-level degrees. A post-graduate <b>research</b> <b>doctorate</b> (Dr. med. univ. et sci. med.) can be obtained, for example, after three years post-graduate studies at a Faculty of Medicine.|$|E
2500|$|In France, {{the title}} of Docteur is only used {{generally}} for physicians (médecin), but {{can also be used}} (although this is uncommon) by dentists and pharmacists, along with holders of research doctorates. Medical professionals do not normally hold a doctorate, which in France is used only to refer to a <b>research</b> <b>doctorate,</b> but a [...] "State Diploma of Doctor of Medicine" [...] (Diplôme d'État de docteur en médecine).|$|E
5000|$|The {{structure}} of US doctoral programs is more formal and complex than some others. US <b>research</b> <b>doctorates</b> are awarded for successfully completing and defending independent research {{presented in the}} form of a dissertation, along with advanced study. Multiple professional degrees use the term [...] "doctor" [...] in their title, such as Juris Doctor and Doctor of Medicine, but these degrees do not always contain an independent research component or always require a dissertation and should not be confused with Ph.D./D.Phil./Ed.D./D.Ed. degrees or other <b>research</b> <b>doctorates.</b> Law school graduates, although awarded the J.D. degree, are not normally addressed as [...] "doctor". In legal studies the Ph.D. equivalent is the much rarer Doctor of Juridical Science.|$|R

50|$|In South Africa, the Doctor of Technology or Doctor Technologiae (DTech) is {{equivalent}} to other <b>research</b> <b>doctorates</b> at level 10 of the South African National Qualifications Framework. It is normally awarded by universities of technology and can be awarded {{in a wide variety}} of fields, not just technology.|$|R
2500|$|An honorary {{doctorate}} is {{a doctoral}} degree awarded for {{service to the}} institution or the wider community. [...] It may also be awarded for outstanding achievement in a particular field. [...] This service or achievement {{does not need to}} be academic in nature. Often, the same set of degrees is used for higher doctorates, but they are distinguished as being honoris causa: in comprehensive lists, the lettering used to indicate the possession of a higher doctorate is often adjusted to indicate this, for example, [...] "Hon. Sc.D.", as opposed to the earned <b>research</b> <b>doctorate</b> [...] "Sc.D.". The degrees of Doctor of the University (D.Univ.) and Doctor of Humane Letters (D.H.L.), however, are only awarded as honorary degrees.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} a number of Superior Graduate Schools (Grandes écoles) or Scuola Superiore Universitaria, offer officially {{recognized}} titles, including the Diploma di Perfezionamento equivalent to a Doctorate, Dottorato di Ricerca i.e. <b>Research</b> <b>Doctorate</b> or Doctor Philosophiae i.e. Ph.D. Some of them also organize courses Master's degree. There are three Superior Graduate Schools with [...] "university status", three institutes with the status of Doctoral Colleges, which function at graduate and post-graduate level. Nine further schools are direct offshoots of the universities (i.e. do not have their own 'university status'). The first one is the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa (founded in 1810 by Napoleon as a branch of École Normale Supérieure), taking the model of organization from the famous École Normale Supérieure. These institutions are {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "Schools of Excellence" [...] (i.e. [...] "Scuole di Eccellenza").|$|E
2500|$|The first {{university}} of Western civilization, the University of Bologna, {{is located in}} Italy, where until modern times the only degree granted {{was that of the}} doctorate, and all other Italian universities followed that model. During the 20th century Italian universities introduced more advanced research degrees, such as the Ph.D., and now that {{it is part of the}} E.U. Bologna Process, a new three-year first degree, or [...] "laurea" [...] (equivalent to a B.A. of other countries), has been introduced. The old-style [...] "laurea" [...] is now known as [...] "laurea magistrale/specialistica" [...] (Bologna Process second cycle/ISCED 2011 Level 7). For historical reasons, even to this day, the title of [...] "dottore/dottoressa" [...] (abbrev. both as dott/dott.ssa or as dr./dr.ssa [...] ) is awarded even to those who have studied for a [...] "laurea". Upper levels of degree are anyway shown in the title, as those who obtain a master's degree can be referred to as [...] "dottore/dottoressa magistrale" [...] (masterly doctor) while those who achieve the relatively new program of [...] "dottorato di ricerca" [...] (<b>research</b> <b>doctorate,</b> equivalent of a Ph.D.), carry the title of [...] "dottore/dottoressa di ricerca" [...] (research doctor), which can be abbreviated as [...] "Dott.

50|$|Doctor of Divinity {{is not to}} be {{confused}} with Doctor of Theology (Th.

Many universities award a Ph.D. rather than a Th.D. to graduates of higher-level religious studies programs. Doctor of Sacred Theology is a <b>research</b> <b>doctorate</b> in theology, but particular to Catholic Pontifical Universities and Faculties.
