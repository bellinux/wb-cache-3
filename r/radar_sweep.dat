50|$|The PAVE PAWS radar uses nearly 3,600 small {{active antenna}} {{elements}} coordinated by two computers. One computer is on-line at all times, {{while the second}} automatically takes control if the first fails. The computers control the distribution of energy to the antennas to form precise patterns, allowing the radar to detect objects moving {{at a very high}} speed since no mechanical parts limit the <b>radar</b> <b>sweep.</b> The radar can change its point of focus in milliseconds, while conventional radars may take up to a minute to mechanically swing from one area to another. The main building is shaped like a pyramid with a triangular base 105 feet on each side. The two radiating faces are tilted back 20 degrees. Pave PAWS radar beams reach outward for nearly 3,000 nautical miles in a 240-degree sweep. At its extreme range, it can detect an object {{the size of a small}} car.

5000|$|The {{antenna beam}} becomes wider as the {{aircraft}} gets farther away, making the position information less accurate. Additionally, detecting changes in aircraft velocity requires several <b>radar</b> <b>sweeps</b> that are spaced several seconds apart. In contrast, a system using ADS-B creates and listens for periodic position and intent reports from aircraft. These reports are generated {{based on the}} aircraft's navigation system, and distributed via {{one or more of}} the ADS-B data links. The accuracy of the data is no longer susceptible to the position of the aircraft or the length of time between <b>radar</b> <b>sweeps.</b> (However, the signal strength of the signal received from the aircraft at the ground station is still dependent on the range from the aircraft to the receiver, and interference, obstacles, or weather could degrade the integrity of the received signal enough to prevent the digital data from being decoded without errors; when the aircraft is farther away, the weaker received signal will tend to be more affected by the aforementioned adverse factors and is less likely to be received without errors in their presence. While error detection codes will allow the errors to be recognized as errors, so that the system maintains full accuracy regardless of aircraft position when the signal can be received and decoded correctly, this advantage does not equate to total indifference to the range of an aircraft from the ground station.) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{fast and}} {{efficient}} subsurface radar imaging procedure, {{based on a}} multi-channel cart system, has been developed and tested {{within the framework of}} a large-scale archaeological investigation project in northern Italy. The tested cart comprises 14 closely-spaced dipoles, rotated by 45 ° with respect to the dragging direction, and allows unidirectional scanning operations. Using this approach, an area of approximately 75 000 m 2 was surveyed daytime via recording of a dense grid of about 490 km of radar profiles. Geo-referencing of the scanning trajectories was achieved operating a separate on-board differential Global Positioning System in real-time kinematic mode. In this configuration the final positioning error of the <b>radar</b> <b>sweeps</b> was less than 0. 05 m. The large amount of collected data, of the order of tens of GBytes, was processed, using an open-source software package, on a workstation-based environment. A set of specific codes was developed to fully automate the data processing and the image generation procedure. Critical steps during code development were the integration of positioning and radar data, the referencing of the single <b>radar</b> <b>sweeps</b> and the correction for changes in the spectral amplitude of the different channels.

40|$|Abstract — The aim of {{this work}} is the {{analysis}} of the signal composition observed in a single <b>radar</b> <b>sweep</b> during an underground investigation with an ultra-wide-band (UWB) radar. The electromagnetic (EM) response of a buried object, the radar pulse spectrum and the antenna set-up, all strongly influence the accuracy of the time of flight estimate. The analysis of the time domain signal will discuss the effects of the antenna coupling with the ground (first arrival pulse from air-soil interface) and the interference of overlapping pulses due to multiple interfaces and multiple reflections. The results of this analysis are based on simulations with parameters characteristic of an investigation of layered medium and signal processing schemes to extract information about soil and buried objects composition will be addressed.

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{describes}} {{the comparison of}} three different types of continuous wave (CW) radars to interrogate surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors. The CW types are as follows: a frequency modulated (FMCW), a frequency stepped (FSCW) and a switched frequency stepped (S-FSCW) radar. All types operate in the 2. 4  GHz ISM band with a bandwidth of approximately 80  MHz. Whereas the sweep time of FSCW type radars typically is around 100  ms the FMCW <b>radar</b> <b>sweep</b> lasts only 100  μs. Measurements of all three types have been taken in equal standard settings to evaluate their phase stability, important for high precision sensing. The S-FSCW shows overall the best phase stability. The FMCW has about a factor 5 less stability due to the fast sweep time, but can be improved by averaging considerably. Furthermore the influence of ambient temperature exposure of the electronics from − 20 ∘C to + 50 ∘C on the phase stability is presented in this paper...|$|E

A <b>radar</b> <b>sweep</b> rotates clockwise and tactile feedback is provided where each sweep distinctly conveys the user’s current direction and {{the direction in which}} the user must travel. In a first study, we evaluated the overall concept and tested five different tactile patterns to communicate the two different directions via a single tactor. The results show that people are able to easily understand the NaviRadar concept and can identify the correct direction with a mean deviation of 37 ° out of the full 360 ° provided. A second study shows that NaviRadar achieves similar results in terms of perceived usability and navigation performance when compared with spoken instructions. By using only tactile feedback, NaviRadar provides distinct advantages over current systems. In particular, no visual attention is required to navigate; thus, it can be spent on providing greater awareness of one’s surroundings. Moreover, the lack of audio attention enables it to be used in noisy environments or this attention can be better spent on talking with others during navigation.

40|$|Summary The {{objectives}} {{of our study}} were to assess the feasibility of using ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to study roots over {{a broad range of}} soil conditions in the southeastern United States. Study sites were located in the Southern Piedmont, Carolina Sandhills and Atlantic Coast Flatwoods. At each site, we tested for selection of the appropriate antenna (400 MHz versus 1. 5 GHz), determined the ability of GPR to resolve roots and buried organic debris, assessed root size, estimated root biomass, and gauged the practicality of using GPR. Resolution of roots was best in sandy, excessively drained soils, whereas soils with high soil water and clay contents seriously degraded resolution and observation depth. In the Carolina Sandhills, 16 1 × 1 -m plots were scanned with the 1. 5 GHz antenna using overlapping grids. Plots were subsequently excavated, larger roots (> 0. 5 cm diameter) sketched on graph paper before removal, and all roots oven-dried, classified by size and weighed. Roots as small as 0. 5 cm in diameter were detected with GPR. We were able to size roots (0. 5 to 6. 5 cm in diameter) that were oriented perpendicular to the <b>radar</b> <b>sweep</b> (r 2 = 0. 81, P = 0. 0004). Use of image analysis software to relate the magnitude of radar parabolas to actual root biomass resulted in significant correlations (r 2 = 0. 55, P = 0. 0274). Orientation and geometry of the reflective surface seemed to have a greater influence on parabola dimensions than did root size. We conclude that the utility of current GPR technology for estimating root biomass is site-specific, and that GPR is ineffective in soils with high clay or water content and at sites with rough terrain (most forests). Under particular soil and site conditions, GPR appears to be useful for augmenting traditional biomass sampling...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of the Farley-Buneman instability in 2 - 1 / 2 dimensions using particle ions and fluid electrons show the growth, saturation and nonlinear behavior of two-stream waves. This hybrid technique models the saturated {{state of the}} instability for a much {{longer period of time}} than the pure particle codes that preceded it. While focusing principally on modeling the topside E region equatorial electrojet, many of these results apply to the auroral two-stream instability as well. The following features are seen in all our hybrid simulations: (1) wave growth at an angle offset from the electron drift direction where the angle depends on the strength of the driving electric field, (2) nonlinear coupling to waves traveling perpendicular to the propagation direction of the principal two-stream waves, (3) a saturated wave phase velocity at or above the sound speed but well below the velocity predicted by linear theory and (4) phase velocities which remain almost constant as a simulated <b>radar</b> <b>sweeps</b> from a horizontal direction to nearly vertical. The nonlinear electron motion dominates the behavior of these waves. Further, these simulations indicate that ion kinetic effects are not essential for the saturation of the instability and that electron temperature effects have a minor impact on the final saturated state...|$|R

DOW data, validated against nearby weather station data, are combined with surface roughness fields derived from land-use mapping to produce fine spatial scale, two-dimensional maps of the 10 m above ground level (AGL) open-terrain exposure and exposure-influenced winds over Port Arthur. The DOW collected; 3000 low-elevation <b>radar</b> <b>sweeps</b> at 12 -s intervals for. 10 h during {{the passage of the}} hurricane.

Finescale HBLwind streaks are observed to have length scales ofO(300 m), smaller thanpreviously identified in otherHBL studies. The HBL streaks are tracked as they pass over an FCMP-WS located in flat, open terrain and another FCMP-WS located near a subdivision. DOW data collected over the FCMP-WS are reduced to anemometer height, using roughness lengths calculated fromDOWandFCMP-WSdata.

50|$|There are {{two other}} facets related to PRF that the {{designer}} must weigh very carefully; the beamwidth characteristics of the antenna, and the required periodicity with which the <b>radar</b> must <b>sweep</b> the field of view. A radar with a 1° horizontal beamwidth that sweeps the entire 360° horizon every 2 seconds with a PRF of 1080 Hz will radiate 6 pulses over each 1-degree arc. If the receiver needs at least 12 reflected pulses of similar amplitudes to achieve an acceptable probability of detection, then there are three choices for the designer: double the PRF, halve the sweep speed, or double the beamwidth. In reality, all three choices are used, to varying extents; radar design is all about compromises between conflicting pressures.|$|R
50|$|The {{second major}} {{improvement}} is increased azimuth accuracy. With PSRs and old SSRs, azimuth {{of the aircraft}} {{is determined by the}} half split (centroid) method. The half split method is computed by recording the azimuth of the first and last replies from the aircraft, as the <b>radar</b> beam <b>sweeps</b> past its position. Then the midpoint between the start and stop azimuth is used for aircraft position. With MSSR (monopulse secondary surveillance radar) and Mode S, the radar can use the information of one reply to determine azimuth. This is calculated based on the RF phase of the aircraft reply, as determined by the sum and difference antenna elements, and is called monopulse. This monopulse method results in superior azimuth resolution, and removes target jitter from the display.|$|R
5000|$|When Northrop Grumman Corporation {{first started}} {{development}} of the ASR-9, it was primarily to upgrade the aging ASR-4, -5 and -6 radar equipment at locations that did not receive the previous version, the ASR-8. The ASR-9 monitoring system was formally designated by the FAA {{to be used as}} a Primary Radar replacement, as well as a live weather condition monitor utilized from the Air Traffic Control tower. ASR-9 was the first Radar System to enable the detection of a moving target with circular polarization, therefore significantly enhancing the ability to locate aircraft in various weather conditions. In addition to the enhanced detection system, six separate weather channels can be switch on to display the precipitation reflectivity measured from the vertical elevation beam. The measurements taken from the by the weather system are updated every 30 seconds to increase the accuracy. The Federal Aviation Administration has chosen different 35 sites around the United States to receive a Weather Systems Processor (WSP) upgrade to be added to the existing ASR-9's. This new processor monitored Doppler wind velocity, enabling the detection of low-altitude wind shear around airports. The Weather Systems Processor also improved the ASR-9's accuracy of precipitation reflectivity measurements taken by eliminating the amount of ground clutter picked up by the <b>radar</b> <b>sweeps.</b> The WSP provided a velocity imagery, as well as full resolution reflectivity that extends all the way to the end of the ASR-9's monitor range of sixty nautical miles. The WSP sweep images are updated every 4.8 seconds, with a range of fifteen nautical miles where the processors operate the wind shear algorithms. Launching the upgrade program for the ASR-9's radar processor will ultimately enhance the amount of weather data the computer can process, leading to an even greater weather surveillance range of up to one hundred twenty nautical miles.|$|R
