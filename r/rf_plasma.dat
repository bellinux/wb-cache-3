The films have been analysed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometry and atomic force microscopy (AFM). From the analysis of the Fr-IR spectra it results that the films become more amorphous and inorganic as <b>RF</b> <b>plasma</b> power increases. The incorporation of oxygen in the deposited layers, mainly due to the atmospheric attack, has been evaluated by XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy. Reflectance/transmittance spectra, acquired in the range of 200 - 2500 nm, allow to descrive the film absorption edge for interband transitions. A relationship between the optical energy band gap, deduced from the absorption coefficient curve, and the deposition <b>RF</b> <b>plasma</b> power has been investigated. The reduction of the optical energy gap from 3. 85 to 3. 69 eV and the broadening of the optical absorption tail with <b>RF</b> <b>plasma</b> power increasing from 100 to 300 W are ascribed to the growth of structural disorder, while the increase of the refractive index, evaluated at 630 nm, is attributed to a slight densification of the film.

An asymmetrical dual-frequency capacitively coupled plasma reactor has been modeled with one dimensional PIC/MCC (Particle in Cell with Implemented Monte Carlo Collisions) code. The main feature of the modeling code represents the realistic model of the ion-induced secondary electron emission. Secondary emission of electrons is one of the important processes that effects the characteristics of <b>rf</b> <b>plasmas.</b> For modeling the secondary yield per ion, we have used equations proposed by Phelps and Petrović (Plasma Sources Sci.

Results are compared for yields for the so called “dirty” and “clean” surfaces, and the spatial profiles of charged particles and ion energy distributions were observed. The simulation results indicate that the plasma characteristics are greatly affected by the ion-induced secondary emission, changing the overall parameters of dual-frequency capacitively coupled plasma reactors especially in applications as etching devices. Conclusion is that an exact model of the secondary electron emission should be included, as to ensure better agreement between simulation and experiment...|$|R

The microwave resonance of the hairpin is used to determine electron density. Two types of hairpin probe were used.

The other probe {{was designed to be}} fully floating, being (dc) isolated from ground and able to float with RF variations in the plasma potential. Additional measurements of the <b>RF</b> <b>plasma</b> potential and its effect on the dc floating potential of the former probe were made using a wire loop probe. The resonant frequency of the dc coupled probe at zero current (nominal floating potential) was less than that determined from the fully floating probe. This is attributed to the wider sheath around the former caused by <b>RF</b> <b>plasma</b> potential across it. The presence of the electron-free sheath around the wires of the hairpin is included in the analysis that links the resonant frequency to the electron density in the bulk plasma. When the dc coupled probe was biased at the true floating potential (determined from independent loop probe measurements) its resonant frequency was closer to, though still consistently higher than, that of the floating probe. This work shows that RF potential across the probe sheath affects the resonance of a hairpin probe and should be accounted for when using hairpin probes in discharges where <b>RF</b> <b>plasma</b> potential variations are even as low as a few times the electron temperature (in volts) ...|$|E
