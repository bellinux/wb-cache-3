40|$|This review {{focuses on}} the methods {{available}} for measuring <b>reversible</b> airways <b>obstruction,</b> <b>bronchial</b> hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and inflammation as hallmarks of asthma, and their role in monitoring children with asthma. Persistent <b>bronchial</b> <b>obstruction</b> may occur in asymptomatic children and is considered {{a risk factor for}} severe asthma episodes and is associated with poor asthma outcome. Annual measurement of forced expiratory volume in 1  s using office based spirometry is considered useful. Other lung function measurements including the assessment of BHR may be reserved for children with possible exercise limitations, poor symptom perception and those not responding to their current treatment or with atypical asthma symptoms, and performed on a higher specialty level. To date, for most methods of measuring lung function there are no proper randomised controlled or large longitudinal studies available to establish their role in asthma management in children. Noninvasive biomarkers for monitoring inflammation in children are available, for example the measurement of exhaled nitric oxide fraction, and the assessment of induced sputum cytology or inflammatory mediators in the exhaled breath condensate. However, their role and usefulness in routine clinical practice to monitor and guide therapy remains unclear, and therefore, their use should be reserved for selected cases...|$|R

40|$|Asthma is a common disease, {{occurring}} increasingly {{among both}} children and adults. It is defined as a chronic inflammatory disease, characterized by hyperresponsiveness and <b>reversible</b> <b>bronchial</b> <b>obstruction.</b> The diagnosis of asthma in children is currently based mainly on clinical and spirometric evaluation {{as well as on}} the assessment of response to anti-inflammatory treatment. Currently there are ongoing discussions on the choice of optimal diagnostic and staging methods. Therefore, the measurement of the levels of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is being seen as a viable option. The results of the measurement are obtained easily and non-invasively. High variability in the levels depending on both environmental factors and patient cooperation is a disadvantage of the test. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the levels of exhaled nitric oxide and the severity of asthma based on spirometric outcomes. A total of  141 children aged 5 – 17 years, including 35  patients diagnosed with asthma, among whom eight were in the stage of exacerbation, were qualified for the study. The control group consisted of  106 children admitted to the hospital for other reasons, with the exception of respiratory diseases. Spirometry and FeNO measurements were performed. No statistically {{significant differences were found between}} FeNO levels in patients with asthma or asthma exacerbations and the control group. The highest variation of FeNO levels was observed in the control group, indicating intersubject and factor variability of FeNO levels in exhaled gases. Although the utility of FeNO levels as an indicator of the severity of airway inflammation has been demonstrated in numerous studies, this study questions the usefulness of this parameter as a marker of asthma severity. This is probably due to the large intersubject variations in the concentration of exhaled NO, depending on patient cooperation and clinical status (and thus the accuracy of spirometry) and the fact that FeNO is affected by multiple other factors, such as diet rich in nitrogen compounds, hyperventilation, viral infections, tobacco smoke, airway pH.

METHOD: Subjects with signs of symptoms indicating asthma (persistent or recurrent respiratory symptoms or signs of <b>reversible</b> <b>bronchial</b> <b>obstruction)</b> (n = 323) were studied. They had been identified in a population screening for asthma. A histamine provocation test and PEF variability were assessed over a three-week period. Asthma was defined as signs or symptoms together with a reversible airflow obstruction or BHR to the histamine challenge test. BHR {{was defined as a}} PC 20 histamine of or = 15 %. Overall correlation between PC 20 and PEF variability was calculated using Spearman's rho. Furthermore, a decision tree was constructed to clarify the role of BHR in diagnosing asthma. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients had a reversibility in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) of > or = 9 % predicted, 131 patients showed a PC 20 of or = 15 %. Overall correlation was poor at only - 0. 27 (P < 0. 0001). One hundred and fourteen of the 131 patients diagnosed as having asthma when the histamine challenge test was used were not diagnosed by PEF variability. CONCLUSION: PEF variability cannot replace bronchial provocation testing in assessing BHR. This indicates that PEF variability and bronchial provocation do not measure the same aspects of BHR. If BHR testing is required in diagnosing asthma, a bronchial provocation test has to be used in general practice as well...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundExhaled {{nitric oxide}} (eNO) {{is a useful}} marker of eosinophilic airway {{inflammation}} in asthma patients. There is no study to show {{the relationship between the}} eNO measured by using an off-line method and the degree of reversibility of airflow limitation in Japanese asthma patients. We sought to investigate the relationship between the eNO level measured by using an off-line method and the degree of reversibility of bronchial constriction in Japanese asthma patients. MethodsThe study population comprised 97 asthma patients in our outpatient clinic with some patients in both groups who received inhaled corticosteroid treatment. We measured eNO levels, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) before and after treatment, reversible airway obstruction (ΔFEV 1) after inhalation of bronchodilator, and other parameters. ResultseNO was significantly correlated with peripheral blood eosinophil counts in asthma patients (in steroid-naïve asthma patients, r = 0. 544, p < 0. 0001; in asthma patients treated with inhaled corticosteroid, r = 0. 463, p = 0. 026), and subjects with severe eosinophilia in sputum showed high levels of eNO (mild eosino- philia versus severe, p = 0. 0152). Among patients with obstructive impairment, eNO levels were correlated with ΔFEV 1 regardless of whether patients received (r = 0. 527, p = 0. 0435) or did not receive (r = 0. 64, p = 0. 0056) inhaled corticosteroid. In subjects with normal pulmonary function, there was no significant relationship between eNO and AFEV 1 with or without inhaled corticosteroid. ConclusionsIn patients with obstructive impairment, eNO reflects the degree of reversible airflow limitation. In subjects with normal pulmonary function, eNO may facilitate the diagnosis and management of asthma, rather than indicate <b>reversible</b> <b>bronchial</b> <b>obstruction.</b> eNO measurement by off-line methods is applicable as a potential tool for the diagnosis of asthma and management of asthma patients...|$|E

40|$|Asthma {{is now one}} of {{the most}} common chronic {{diseases}} in Western countries and is characterized by <b>reversible</b> airway <b>obstruction,</b> <b>bronchial</b> hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation. For many years, anti-inflammatory therapy in asthma has been largely reliant on glucocorticoids (GCs) – particularly in their inhaled form – and their use is associated with a striking reduction in the numbers of activated eosinophils, mast cells, and T cells in vivo. However, although GCs can be efficacious, they are also rather nonspecific in their actions and may not be of benefit to patients with severe asthma who experience virally-induced exacerbations of their disease. Their use also raises concerns regarding side effects and compliance particularly in children and adolescents. Furthermore, even in cases of good compliance, patients with moderate and severe asthma may experience significant residual symptoms including exacerbations of their disease that in some cases can be life-threatening (Walsh 2006). There is therefore a clear need for the development of more effective and targeted therapy for asthma. Allergic asthma is the most common form of the disease and is characterized b...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Exercise induced airway {{obstruction}} {{is defined}} as an acute, <b>reversible</b> <b>bronchial</b> <b>obstruction</b> occurring immediately after physical exercise. Exercise induced airway obstruction is a common manifestation {{in children and adolescents}} with asthma and is associated with an impaired quality of life. Childhood asthma is characterized by chronic inflammation of the lower airways and often accompanied by allergies. Another important manifestation of allergy is allergic rhinitis, which is an inflammatory disorder of the upper airways, highly prevalent in asthmatic children. Allergic rhinitis and asthma are therefore recognized as manifestations of a single syndrome. The aim of the study is to investigate whether treatment of allergic rhinitis with an intra-nasal corticosteroid protects against airway obstruction after exercise in cold air. Methods: 44 children, aged 12 - 17 years, with a history of allergic asthma were recruited from the outpatient clinic of the pediatric department of the Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede and were screened for inclusion in the study. Included patients were treated for 3 weeks ± 5 days with fluticasone furoate (Avamys®) or placebo. Before and after treatment they underwent an exercise provocation challenge. The change in exercise induced fall of FEV 1 after treatment was analyzed. Furthermore changes in asthma control score (ACQ), quality of life and fraction of the exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) were analyzed. Study design: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled prospective study. Results: 32 Patients were included, 25 completed the study. Exercise induced fall of FEV 1 was significantly reduced (p< 0. 01) in the fluticasone furoate group, whereas no significant changes were observed in the placebo group. The between group difference in exercise induced fall of FEV 1 was also significant (p= 0. 04). A statistically significant increase in {{the quality of life in}} activity limitation, measured by the Paediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, was found in the fluticasone furoate group as well (p= 0. 03). No significant changes were observed in FeNO and ACQ. Conclusion: Treatment of allergic rhinitis with a nasal corticosteroid reduces exercise induced airway obstruction and improves quality of life, regarding activity limitation, in asthmatic children. ...|$|E
40|$|Asthma {{is now one}} of {{the most}} common chronic {{diseases}} in westernized countries and is characterized by <b>reversible</b> airway <b>obstruction,</b> <b>bronchial</b> hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Key pathological features include: infiltration of the airways by activated lymphocytes and eosinophils; damage to, and loss of, the bronchial epithelium; mast cell degranulation; mucous gland hyperplasia; and collagen deposition in the epithelial sub-basement membrane area. Presently, antiinflammatory therapy in asthma is largely reliant on corticosteroids, particularly in their inhaled form, and their use is associated with a striking reduction in the numbers of activated eosinophils, mast cells, and T cells in vivo. For the majority of patients, corticosteroids are effective at suppressing airway inflammation and the associated re-modelling of the airways that leads to progressive and irreversible loss of lung function. In his overview, Olof Selroos (2007) describes the various treatment options for the use of inhaled corticosteroids therapy in asthma with an emphasis on Symbicort SMART ® (Symbicort Maintenance and Reliever Therapy). This consists of a budesonide–formoterol combination enabling patients to use one inhaler for both maintenance and reliever therapy. Benefits of th...|$|R

40|$|Background: In {{patients}} with <b>bronchial</b> <b>obstruction,</b> {{pulmonary function tests}} may not change significantly after intervention. The airflow asynchrony in both lungs due to unilateral <b>bronchial</b> <b>obstruction</b> may be applicable as a physiological indicator.

Objectives: To investigate the usefulness of left and right lung asynchrony due to unilateral <b>bronchial</b> <b>obstruction</b> as a physiological indicator for interventional bronchoscopy. Methods: Fifty cases with central airway obstruction were classified into three groups: tracheal, <b>bronchial</b> and extensive <b>obstruction.</b> The gap index was defined as the absolute value of the average of gaps between the left and right lung sound intensity peaks for a 12 -second duration. Results: Before interventional bronchoscopy, the gap index was significantly higher in the bronchial (p, 0. 05) and extensive obstruction groups (p, 0. 05) than in the tracheal group.

40|$|AbstractBronchial asthma {{is defined}} as a chronic {{inflammatory}} disease resulting in a <b>reversible</b> and variable <b>bronchial</b> <b>obstruction.</b> For the clinical diagnosis of the disease there are some key indicators but as there is no ‘gold standard’ a correct diagnosis will sometimes not be obtained. Examples are patients in a symptom-free stage, current medication interfering with the methods used, patients with asthma-like symptoms reporting lack of effect of bronchodilators and patients who are unable to perform a forced expiration in an airway function test. The prevalence of asthma is reported to be 5 – 10 %. The prevalence of asthma-like symptoms may be double this. The term ‘asthma-like’ has been used to an increasing extent during the last few years, which may indicate an increasing awareness of the fact that asthma-like symptoms are not always classical asthma. In this overview some disorders with asthma-like symptoms, especially in adults, are presented. The spectrum of differential diagnoses in a clinic may depend on which doctor/specialist the patient is consulting. In an asthma and allergy clinic it has been found that the most common differential diagnoses are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), non-asthmatic cough and sensory hyper-reactivity (SHR), a disorder which is sometimes mixed up with asthma due to similar symptoms (heavy breathing, cough, increased secretion, difficulty in getting air etc.) and similar trigger factors (smoke, strong scents, exercise, cold air etc.). Recently {{it has been suggested that}} a capsaicin inhalation test may be an objective test for identifying patients with SHR. In asthma effective treatment is available today but in asthma-like disorders, such as SHR, no effective therapy is available, underlining the need of further research for understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms...|$|R

We assess {{the possibility of a}} common genetic origin and investigate whether the lung cancer susceptibility locus on chromosome 5 p 15. 33 increases the risk for <b>bronchial</b> <b>obstruction</b> and emphysema. Methods: Three variants in the 5 p 15. 33 locus encompassing the TERT and CLPTM 1 L genes were genotyped in 777 heavy smokers and 212 lung cancer patients. Participants underwent pulmonary function tests and computed tomography (CT) of the chest, and took questionnaires assessing smoking behaviour. Results: The rs 31489 C-allele correlated with reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1; P= 0. 006). Homozygous carriers of the rs 31489 C-allele exhibited increased susceptibility to <b>bronchial</b> <b>obstruction</b> with an odds ratio (OR) of 1. 82 (95 % confidence interval [CI]= 1. 24 - 2. 69; P= 0. 002). A similar association was noticed for lung diffusing capacity (DLCO; P= 0. 004). Consistent herewith, CC-carriers had an increased risk of emphysema (OR= 2. 04; CI= 1. 41 - 2. 94; P= 1. 73 x 10 - 4) and displayed more alveolar destruction. Finally, CC-carriers also had an increased risk for lung cancer (OR= 1. 90; CI= 1. 21 - 2. 99; P= 0. 005) and were more susceptible to develop both lung cancer and <b>bronchial</b> <b>obstruction</b> than lung cancer alone (OR= 2. 11; CI= 1. 04 - 4. 26; P= 0. 038).

METHODS: We performed on-site screening study of <b>bronchial</b> <b>obstruction</b> using an electronic mini-spirometer (EMS) on an entire population of dairy farmers (n = 147) from two villages in Brittany, France. Suspected <b>bronchial</b> <b>obstruction</b> (FEV 1 /FEV 6 < 0. 8) was confirmed with standardized lung function tests (FEV 1 /FVC ≤ 0. 7). We assessed past medical histories, respiratory symptoms, and occupational tasks of subjects with bronchial obstruction; asthmatics were defined as atopic and/or reversible; smoking-induced COPD patients were defined as non-reversible, non-atopic with smoking histories (≥ 5 PY); and FI-COPD patients were defined as non-reversible, non-atopic, and non-smokers. RESULTS: Using the EMS, 30. 6 % (n = 45) of dairy farmers were suspected of <b>bronchial</b> <b>obstruction</b> and underwent standardized spirometry. The FEV 1 /FEV 6 ratio and FEV 1 /FVC ratio were in good agreement (r² = 0. 66, P < 0. 0001).

A <b>bronchial</b> <b>obstruction</b> syndrome was detected in 30 (16. 9 %) patients, with 21 (11. 2 %) of them having no chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diagnosis. 4 patients (2. 3 %) with obstructive pulmonary disease had no <b>bronchial</b> <b>obstruction.</b> Thus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was misdiagnosed in 13. 5 % cases. In patients undergoing isolated CABG, negative relationship was revealed between the Tiffno index and hospital stay (regression coefficient – 6. 9, 95 %, confidence interval – 14. 4 … 0. 6; p = 0. 07). In patients operated with the myocardium stabilized, bimammary grafting tended to increase hospital stay by an average of 4. 3 days (95 % CI 1. 5 – 7. 1; p= 0. 003). The majority of patients had a low O 2 CU. O 2 CU lower than 16. 2 ml/l is associated with an increased risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) in the postoperative period (OR 2. 96; 95 % CI 1. 01 – 9. 83; p = 0. 04). No significant associations were observed between the degree of <b>bronchial</b> <b>obstruction</b> and the number of perioperative complications. Conclusion. The degree of <b>bronchial</b> <b>obstruction</b> could be positively associated with the length of hospital stay. A critically low level of O 2 CU is explained by an increased risk of postoperative AF. Further research might result in the identification of predictors for respiratory complications and long-term mortality in patients after CABG. </p...|$|R
