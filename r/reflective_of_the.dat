5|$|Roddenberry {{intended}} {{the show to}} have a progressive political agenda <b>reflective</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emerging counter-culture of the youth movement, though he was not fully forthcoming to the networks about this. He wanted Star Trek to show humanity what it might develop into, if it would learn from {{the lessons of the}} past, most specifically by ending violence. An extreme example is the alien species, the Vulcans, who had a violent past but learned to control their emotions. Roddenberry also gave Star Trek an anti-war message and depicted the United Federation of Planets as an ideal, optimistic version of the United Nations. His efforts were opposed by the network because of concerns over marketability, e.g., they opposed Roddenberry's insistence that Enterprise have a racially diverse crew.|$|E

During the last predynastic phase, the Naqada culture began using written symbols that eventually were developed into a full system of hieroglyphs for writing the ancient Egyptian language.|$|E

The player is then placed into a level <b>reflective</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> score they received on the test.

5|$|The {{response}} to the riots on the Chinese blogosphere was markedly more varied than the official response. Despite blocks and censorship, Internet watchers monitored continued attempts by netizens to publish their own thoughts on {{the causes of the}} incident or vent their anger about the violence. While some bloggers were supportive of the government, others were more <b>reflective</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event's cause. On numerous forums and news sites, government workers quickly removed comments about the riots. Common themes were calls for punishment for those responsible; some posts evoked the name of Wang Zhen, the general who is respected by Hans and other minorities, and feared by many Uyghurs for repression after the communist takeover of Xinjiang in 1949.|$|E
5|$|Every year, the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) {{conducts a}} series of surveys on its {{highways}} {{in the state to}} measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2012, UDOT calculated that as few as 6,655vehicles traveled I-84 at the interchange with SR-86 in Henefer, and as many as 18,945vehicles used the highway at the SR-26 interchange in Riverdale. Between 27 and 57percent of the traffic recorded consisted of trucks.

40|$|Abstract.
