5|$|Before the {{widespread}} application of technetium-99m in nuclear medicine, the radioactive isotope thallium-201, with a half-life of 73 hours, {{was the main}} substance for nuclear cardiography.

5|$|A {{number of}} risk scores exist to predict {{bleeding}} in people using warfarin and similar anticoagulants. A commonly used score (HAS-BLED) includes known predictors of warfarin-related bleeding: uncontrolled {{high blood pressure}} (H), abnormal kidney function (A), previous stroke (S), known previous bleeding condition (B), previous labile INR when on anticoagulation (L), elderly as defined by age over 65 (E), and drugs associated with bleeding (e.g. aspirin) or alcohol misuse (D). While their use is recommended in clinical practice guidelines, they are only moderately effective in predicting bleeding risk and do not perform well in predicting hemorrhagic stroke. Bleeding risk may be increased in people on hemodialysis. Another score used to assess bleeding risk on anticoagulation, specifically Warfarin or Coumadin, is the ATRIA score, which uses a weighted additive scale of clinical findings to determine bleeding <b>risk</b> <b>stratification.</b> The risks of bleeding are increased further when warfarin is combined with antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel, aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.|$|E

40|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} as a {{consequence}} of atherosclerosis has a wide variation in clinical presentation and often demands intensive use of diagnostic possibilities. In common practice to determine de extent of the coronary artery disease, the physician will make use of the clinical presentation of the patient, biochemical tests and non-invasive diagnostic techniques. Most of the time the final diagnostic step to show the presence of coronary artery disease is to perform a coronary angiogram to prove the existence of arthrosclerosis. But the general consensus of medical literature is that the coronary angiogram often doesn’t show significant coronary artery disease. With the result that in retrospect the patient underwent unnecessary risk which are involved with a coronary angiogram. 	In this investigation the percentage of coronary artery disease with non significant coronary artery disease, performed at the Isala Klinieken in the first half year of 2010, will be determined. Included in this investigation will be the impact of non-invasieve diagnostic techniques on this percentage. Moreover with the use of several <b>risk</b> <b>stratifications,</b> including the TIMI risk score and the HEART score, the likelihood of the presence of significant coronary disease will be assessed. With the goal of possible use in a prospective setting. 	From all patients included in this investigation 23, 5 % had non-significant coronary artery disease. This percentage varies from 53 % in patients with thoracic chest pain tot 3, 5 % in patients presenting with a STEMI. In {{more than half of the}} cases of thoracic chest pain or stable/unstable angina patients underwent non-invasive diagnostic techniques. A remarkable finding was that patients who had been analyzed with non-invasive techniques were significantly more likely to have non-significant coronary artery disease.

30|$|The {{concept of}} {{automatically}} combining SRT {{of the prostate}} bed with radiation of pelvic lymph nodes as part of SRT is controversial [5, 6, 36]. In the present cohort, seven patients (15.6  %) had LNMs limited to the pelvis and would have potentially benefited from extended SRT. Interestingly, according to clinical <b>risk</b> <b>stratifications</b> for identification of patients with high risk of LNMs [37] and therefore suitable for extended irradiation to the pelvic lymph nodes, only five of these seven patients qualified. Moreover, six patients (13.3  %) scheduled for SRT would not have benefited from radiation to the prostate bed and a general extension of SRT to pelvic lymph nodes as they had extrapelvic disease (rectal soft tissue lesions, retroperitoneal LNMs, and/or bone metastases).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Improving the {{identification}} of clinical vulnerability to psychosis in help-seeking subjects is crucial for refining <b>risk</b> <b>stratifications</b> and implementing intervention strategies. AIMS: To define underlying dimensions of subclinical psychopathology in Ultra-High-Risk (UHR) subjects; to test their temporal stability and association with baseline clinical and functional features; and to evaluate their predictive value for subsequent transition to psychosis. METHOD: 223 subjects meeting the Personal Assessment and Crisis Evaluation (PACE) criteria for UHR were assessed with the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States (CAARMS) and monitored {{for a period of}} up to three years. Data were analysed via principal component analysis (PCA), Spearman correlation analysis and Cox regression. RESULTS: PCA of the CAARMS yielded three orthogonal symptom clusters (negative, disorganized and perceptual-affective instability) with substantial temporal stability over a one-month time span. These clusters were strongly related to global functioning, quality of life, baseline major psychopathology and duration of symptoms before referral. The severity of the CAARMS disorganized component was the strongest predictor of transition to frank psychosis at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: A dimensional approach to CAARMS-measured symptoms may refine current early identification heuristics and provide an alternative way to characterize UHR profiles complementary to the current categorical one...|$|R

It represents a group of clinically and biologically heterogenous malignancies that can be subclasified into several subtypes according to the presence of recurrent genetic aberrations.

These recurrent genetic aberations are aquired lesions, {{they are supposed to be}} the initial hits (that may arise even prenataly) with a causal role in the process of leukemogenesis, which is, however, in the majority of them not yet fully understood.

In this study, previous screening {{history of the}} Dutch-Belgian Lung Cancer Screening trial (NELSON) is investigated on if it predicts the screening outcome (test result and lung cancer risk) of the final screening round. Methods 15 792 participants were randomised (1 : 1) of which 7900 randomised into a screening group. CT screening took place at baseline, and after 1, 2 and 2. 5 years. Initially, three screening outcomes were possible: negative, indeterminate or positive scan result. Probability for screening outcome in the fourth round was calculated for subgroups of participants. Results Based on results {{of the first three}} rounds, three subgroups were identified: (1) those with exclusively negative results (n= 3856; 73. 0 %); (2) those with >= 1 indeterminate result, but never a positive result (n= 1342; 25. 5 %); and (3) with >= 1 positive result (n= 81; 1. 5 %).

40|$|Early {{investigators}} {{suggested that}} ventricular fibrillation without heart failure in {{acute myocardial infarction}} was reliably preceded by warning arrhythmias, and that suppression of such arrhythmias with intravenous lidocaine could avoid the need for resuscitation. While the efficacy and safety of lidocaine have been substantiated, the reliability of warning arrhythmias as predictors for primary ventricular fibrillation has not. We present data showing {{that the risk of}} primary ventricular fibrillation is most dependent on the patient's age and the interval since the onset of his symptoms, rather than on the presence of warning arrhythmias. We have estimated that lidocaine prophylaxis would have to be given to about 12 patients in the highest risk group (patients under age 50 and within six hours of the onset of symptoms), compared to about 400 patients in the lowest risk group (patients above age 70 and more than 24 hours since the onset of symptoms), to prevent one episode of primary ventricular fibrillation in each group. We propose that these <b>risk</b> <b>stratifications,</b> as adapted to the conditions in specific hospitals, provide the most rational approach to lidocaine prophylaxis of primary ventricular fibrillation.

The best-established and widely used clinical application of BNP and NT-proBNP testing is for the emergent diagnosis of CHF in patients presenting with acute dyspnea. Nevertheless, elevated NPs levels can be found in many circumstances involving left ventricular (LV) dysfunction or hypertrophy; right ventricular (RV) dysfunction secondary to pulmonary diseases; cardiac inflammatory or infectious diseases; endocrinology diseases and high output status without decreased LV ejection fraction. Even in the absence of significant clinical evidence of volume overload or LV dysfunction, markedly elevated NP levels can be found in patients with multiple comorbidities with a certain degree of prognostic value.
