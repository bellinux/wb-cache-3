50|$|The <b>metacentric</b> <b>height</b> (GM) is a {{measurement}} of the initial static stability of a floating body. It is calculated as {{the distance between the}} centre of gravity of a ship and its metacentre. A larger <b>metacentric</b> <b>height</b> implies greater initial stability against overturning. The <b>metacentric</b> <b>height</b> also influences the natural period of rolling of a hull, with very large <b>metacentric</b> <b>heights</b> being associated with shorter periods of roll which are uncomfortable for passengers. Hence, a sufficiently, but not excessively, high <b>metacentric</b> <b>height</b> is considered ideal for passenger ships.|$|R
40|$|Values of lateral and {{longitudinal}} <b>metacentric</b> <b>heights</b> {{for various}} seaplanes were calculated {{by means of}} approximate formulae derived here. The data are given in tabular form. Upon plotting these <b>metacentric</b> <b>heights</b> against the corresponding gross weights, {{it appears that the}} <b>metacentric</b> <b>height</b> is approximately a straight line function of the gross weight. For the lateral <b>metacentric</b> <b>height</b> GM = 13 +. 002 W and for longitudinal <b>metacentric</b> <b>height</b> GM = 15 +. 002 W, GM is in feet and the gross weight (W) is in pounds. Although only approximate, it is thought that the values indicated here are a reliable guide to current practice. It is recommended that the longitudinal and lateral <b>metacentric</b> <b>heights</b> be made equal and of the value given by GM = 15 =. 002 W. The proper length or spacing required to satisfy the indicated value may then be obtained from substitution in the approximate formulae for <b>metacentric</b> <b>height...</b>|$|R
40|$|Potentially {{dangerous}} zones {{corresponding to}} dynamical stability phenomena, possibly encountered by ships sailing in rough sea, are estimated nowadays {{with the use}} of the method recommended by IMO in the guidance coded MSC. 1 /Circ. 1228. In this IMO method the parameter governing the natural period of roll is the initial <b>metacentric</b> <b>height.</b> Some earlier studies revealed that the initial <b>metacentric</b> <b>height</b> which is commonly in use on-board ships for the purpose of performing the MSC. 1 /Circ. 1228 -recommended calculations, may significantly vary from the so called equivalent <b>metacentric</b> <b>height</b> obtained for large amplitudes of ship’s roll. In the light of such ascertainment, the paper deals with resultant resonance roll zones locations with regard to the equivalent <b>metacentric</b> <b>height</b> concept remaining appropriate for large amplitudes of roll. The noteworthy transfer of the resonance zones location is disclosed which reflects the distinct configurations of potentially dangerous ship’s course and speed configurations than could be predicted on the basis the initial <b>metacentric</b> <b>height...</b>|$|R

50|$|In addition, United States Coast Guard rules {{apply to}} vessels {{operating}} in U.S. ports and in U.S. waters. Generally these Coast Guard rules concern a minimum <b>metacentric</b> <b>height</b> or a minimum righting moment. Because different countries {{may have different}} requirements for the minimum <b>metacentric</b> <b>height,</b> most ships are now fitted with stability computers that calculate this distance on the fly based on the cargo or crew loading. There are many commercially available computer programs used for this task.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a probabilistic methodology {{for the analysis}} of the vulnerability of a ship to the risk of inception of pure loss of stability events. A pure loss of stability failure is modelled as the persistence of the <b>metacentric</b> <b>height</b> below a critical level for a too long time. The <b>metacentric</b> <b>height</b> is modelled as a stationary Gaussian process with a spectrum obtained from the sea elevation spectrum. The time dependent failure index is obtained under the assumption of filtered Poisson process for the occurrence of critical events. The analysis separates cases where the fluctuation of the <b>metacentric</b> <b>height</b> is narrow-band from those where the bandwidth of the spectrum is wide, with an intermediate blending. In case of narrow-band processes appropriate approximate solutions to the problem are provided, while in the wide-band cases an exponential distribution for the persistence time below the critical level is employed. A rational development for the critical persistence time is also provided considering an approximation of the roll dynamics during periods of time where the <b>metacentric</b> <b>height</b> is negative. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to check the developed approximate distributions for the persistence time, and examples of application are provided for a sample ship...|$|R

50|$|The righting {{couple on}} the ship is {{proportional}} to the horizontal distance between two equal forces. These are gravity acting downwards at the centre of mass and the same magnitude force acting upwards through the centre of buoyancy, and through the metacentre above it. The righting couple {{is proportional to the}} <b>metacentric</b> <b>height</b> multiplied by the sine of the angle of heel, hence the importance of <b>metacentric</b> <b>height</b> to stability. As the hull rights, work is done either by its centre of mass falling, or by water falling to accommodate a rising centre of buoyancy, or both.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the feasibility of reducing the cost, size and weight of an activated fin stabilizer system of a ship with a large <b>metacentric</b> <b>height,</b> by the introduction of a free surface effect. The free surface causes a virtual reduction in the ship's <b>metacentric</b> <b>height,</b> and consequently lowers the requirements of the fin stabilization system. Calculations for a typical large warship indicated that the free surface effect could reduce the cost by about one-third, and the weight of the overall stabilization system by about 22 %.
