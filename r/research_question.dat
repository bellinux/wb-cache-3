25|$|If the Southern Maya Area {{is a part}} of Mesoamerica {{delineated}} {{from the}} rest of Mesoamerica spatially, temporally and, in one specific sense – by the still unresolved question of its possibly crucial role in the origins of Maya civilization - one needs to understand that posing this large <b>research</b> <b>question</b> risks falling into ultimately meaningless, infinitely regressing arguments about how “origins” might be considered or defined – essentially arguments about qualitative or inevitably subjectively rendered entities or topics, giving way to questions such as, What is “Maya civilization”? What is “Maya”? What is “civilization”? What allows us to call this or that civilization “great”? One way to conceptualize the quandary of seeking first cause/s is to understand that such an effort leads to infinite regression unless a metaconcept is accepted which, in the case of Maya civilization, is whatever it is primordially that made “Maya” “Maya.” Another way is to focus on ahistorical processes - environmental circumscription, peer polity interaction, and other theories.|$|E

30|$|The initial {{number of}} <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> in Rebecca’s class {{was higher than}} that in Sam’s class. This {{difference}} {{could be explained by}} the fact that Rebecca’s students had experienced inquiry and the asking of <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> on other occasions, besides the Bio-Tech program, as mentioned by Rebecca. Therefore, as suggested in other studies (Chin and Osborne 2008; Lombard and Schneider 2013), it is important to provide students with opportunities to learn and practice asking <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> in earlier years and in a variety of educational activities. Previous findings regarding the teaching and learning of how to ask <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> in authentic-inquiry environments suggest that students’ ability to ask <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> improve following explicit classroom instruction (Chin 2002; Chin and Osborne 2008; Cuccio-Schirripa and Steiner 2000; Roth and Roychoudhury 1993). Similarly, our results indicate that 11 th-grade biotechnology students’ ability to ask <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> improved following explicit instruction on how to ask <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> in the lesson that included dialogic and interactive whole-class discussions.|$|R
30|$|Rebecca {{dedicated}} {{two parts}} of the lesson to whole-class discussions, focusing on the characteristics and components of <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> that are appropriate for the Bio-Tech program. In {{the first part of the}} lesson, she asked the students to propose possible <b>research</b> <b>questions.</b> She focused on the correct wording of <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> and the characteristics and components of <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> that are suited to the Bio-Tech program. Each episode during the whole-class discussion began with an open teacher question, inviting the students to share their ideas. Rebecca repeatedly connected the discussion to the Bio-Tech topic when discussing possible <b>research</b> <b>questions,</b> and available tools and methods, using the specific Bio-Tech subject-matter terms.|$|R

30|$|In-depth {{examination}} of students’ questions, written {{during the two}} lessons, revealed that only {{in one of the}} lessons students’ ability to ask <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> improved. A connection was found between the more student-centered, dialogic, and interactive teaching strategy and the development of students’ ability to ask <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> in that class. Most of the <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> that were investigated by the students originated from a peer-critique activity during the student-centered lesson, unlike the teacher-focused lesson from which none of the students’ suggested <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> were selected for investigation.|$|R
2500|$|Sciences and Mathematics Department, offers {{students}} the opportunity to participate in the community of scientific research and scholarship as part of their high school experience. [...] In addition to class, formal individual meetings are held once a week. Students select a topic of interest and explore this topic through library research, person to person conversations with research scientists throughout the country, and telecommunication to research and college libraries. [...] Students develop sophisticated data collecting and lab skills by completing a literature search, formulating a <b>research</b> <b>question,</b> articulating hypotheses, collecting and analyzing data, and presenting their findings to a bona fide scientific audience (e.g., The Intel Talent Search, the New York State Science Symposium, and local and regional science fairs).|$|E
2500|$|Considering {{the rapid}} pace {{at which the}} fields of {{medicine}} and health science are developing, it becomes important to investigate the most proper and/or efficient methodologies for conducting research. On the whole, [...] "the primary concern of the researcher must always be the phenomenon, from which the <b>research</b> <b>question</b> is derived, and only subsequent to this can decisions be made as to the most appropriate research methodology, design, and methods to fulfill {{the purposes of the}} research." [...] This statement on research methodology places the researcher at the forefront of his findings. That is, the researcher becomes the person who makes or breaks his or her scientific inquiries rather than the research itself. Even so, [...] "interpretive research and scholarship are creative processes, and methods and methodology are not always singular, a priori, fixed and unchanging." [...] Therefore, viewpoints on scientific inquiries into healthcare matters [...] "will continue to grow and develop with the creativity and insight of interpretive researchers, as they consider emerging ways of investigating the complex social world." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{spread of}} Christianity had several stages {{and it is}} still an open <b>research</b> <b>question.</b> In older publications, the first {{organized}} missions were attributed mainly to Hiberno-Scottish missionaries, but modern works are more sceptical about their direct influence. [...] The territory of Great Moravia was originally evangelized by missionaries coming from the Frankish Empire or Byzantine enclaves in Italy and Dalmatia since the early 8th century and sporadically earlier. Traces of Aquileia-Dalmatic mission are sought in the Great Moravian architecture and linguistic. Northern-Italian influence is assumed also for golden plaques with Christian motives from Bojná (probably from a portable altar), which belong to the most important Christian artefacts dated prior the mission of Saints Cyril and Methodius. Especially after the defeat of the Avars {{at the end of the}} 8th century, Frankish [...] missionaries became the most important part of organized missions. The first Christian church of the Western and Eastern Slavs known to the written sources was built in 828 by Pribina in Nitra. and consecrated by Bishop Adalram of Salzburg. Most of the territory was Christianized until the mid-9th century. Despite the formal endorsement by the elites, the Great Moravian Christianity was described as containing many pagan elements as late as in 852. Grave goods, such as food, could be found even in church graveyards. [...] The Church organization in Great Moravia was supervised by the Bavarian clergy until the arrival of the Byzantine missionaries Saints Cyril and Methodius in 863.|$|E
30|$|To {{examine the}} {{possible}} development of students’ ability to ask <b>research</b> <b>questions,</b> their questions during lessons designed to formulate <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> appropriate for {{investigation in the}} inquiry-oriented Bio-Tech program were analyzed. The possible {{connection between the two}} Bio-Tech teachers’, Rebecca’s and Sam’s, teaching strategy during formulating research-question lesson and the students’ ability to ask <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> was investigated. Rebecca’s students’ ability to ask <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> improved during the examined lesson, whereas that of Sam’s students remained low. Since most of Rebecca’s students’ <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> were subsequently used for the inquiry conducted by the students in the Bio-Tech program a few months later, it is assumed that Rebecca’s lesson was fundamental to the students’ acquisition of this ability and for its sustainability {{for a long period of}} time. Sam’s students did not demonstrate a significant increase in the number of written <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> during the lesson, and none of their questions that were formulated during the lesson were later investigated in the program.|$|R
30|$|Asking {{questions}} {{is considered a}} crucial component in developing scientific literacy, as emphasized in various policy documents worldwide (Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority [ACARA] 2012; European Commission 2007; National Research Council [NRC] 2012; United Kingdom Department of Education 2013). Students’ questions {{play an important role}} in promoting their scientific habits of mind and their understanding of scientific knowledge (Chin and Osborne 2008). Students are expected to ask their own <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> while participating in inquiry learning (Lombard and Schneider 2013), and teachers are expected to teach their students to ask <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> that are feasible for investigations, by providing them with inquiry environments that encourage asking <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> (Hartford and Good 1982). The teacher’s assistance is required in scaffolding students’ learning, transforming their <b>questions</b> into <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> that are appropriate for authentic scientific inquiry (Wayne Allison and Shrigley 1986). However, in most simple inquiry tasks that are carried out in schools, the <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> are given to the students, in contrast to authentic scientific inquiry, where scientists are expected to develop and explore their own <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> (Chinn and Malhotra 2002). In light of the need for a better understanding of the processes contributing to the development of students’ ability to ask <b>research</b> <b>questions,</b> we explored the teaching and learning of this ability in an innovative inquiry-oriented program entitled Bio-Tech. We demonstrate that a student-centered teaching strategy that includes a peer-critique activity during the lesson on how to ask <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> improved students’ ability to formulate <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> that are appropriate for investigation in the Bio-Tech program.|$|R

30|$|Students are {{expected}} to ask their own <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> while participating in scientific inquiry (Cuccio-Schirripa and Steiner 2000). These questions should help students progress to the next stages of the inquiry process (Chin 2002) and develop their procedural and conceptual knowledge (Chin and Brown 2002). Students {{are expected}} to formulate their own <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> during their school science learning (National Research Council [NRC] 2007). In addition, students {{should be able to}} distinguish between <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> and other types of questions and to refine their empirical questions that lead to open investigations (National Research Council [NRC] 2000). Harris et al. (2012) investigated fifth-grade teachers’ instructional moves and teaching strategies while teaching students how to ask <b>research</b> <b>questions.</b> They found that although the teachers displayed a student-centered and dialogic approach, they experienced challenges in developing their students’ ideas into investigable questions. Lombard and Schneider (2013) found that high-school biology majors’ ability to write <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> appropriate for investigation improved while maintaining their ownership of the inquiry process. Some of the students’ ability to write appropriate <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> was achieved by employing structured teacher guidance while engaging students in peer discussions (Lombard and Schneider 2013). Considering the above, {{there is a need to}} explore means of promoting the learning of how to ask <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> in science classrooms. This study aims to explore the development of students’ ability to ask <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> while participating in an inquiry-oriented program.|$|R
30|$|As already noted, {{students}} are expected to ask <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> that will lead them to the planning and execution of inquiry in the Bio-Tech program. This task usually takes place after learning the APL article and the preliminary visit to the research institute, where {{students are}} introduced to the researchers and to the laboratory techniques that will be used in their research. Back in the classroom, the teacher is expected to teach the students how to ask <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> that are appropriate to the Bio-Tech program and the class’s specific research topic. Students are expected to generate their own <b>research</b> <b>questions,</b> with the teacher’s support, which will lead them to the hands-on experiments conducted at the research institute. Here, we focus on lessons in which students were taught how to ask <b>research</b> <b>questions,</b> including an activity in which they formulated <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> and critiqued the questions formulated by their class peers. The teachers who took part in this research were asked to include the peer-critique activity in their question-asking lesson. This activity was designed as a pedagogical tool to encourage the asking of <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> and to promote the students’ communication and collaboration abilities by writing <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> in groups and having them reviewed by their peers, as recommended by Henderson et al.

To answer the <b>research</b> <b>questions,</b> they must be appropriate to the student’s cognitive developmental level and the procedures should be accessible and manageable to the student (Keys 1998). Students’ <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> should be investigable within the limitations of time and materials.

Furthermore, <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> should lead to genuine exploration and discovery of previously unknown knowledge (Cuccio-Schirripa and Steiner 2000).|$|R
30|$|Parts of the {{interviews}} that address {{the teaching and learning}} of asking <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> were transcribed and analyzed.

Teachers’ answers which addressed these issues were transcribed and used to determine teachers’ attitudes towards their teaching approach and students’ learning of asking <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> in the Bio-Tech program. Another science-education researcher validated emerging attitudes, and consensus was reached for determining teachers’ attitude.|$|R
