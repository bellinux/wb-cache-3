5000|$|The American Petroleum Institute (API) {{specification}} 5B lists a [...] "round thread" [...] for tubing, {{often referred}} to as [...] "8 round" [...] or [...] "8rd" [...] for 8 threads per inch. The only other pitch listed is 10 threads per inch. The thread angle at the flank is 60 degrees, and the crest and root rounding radius is approximately p/6 for threads of pitch p. Both the thread angle and rounding radius are more like ordinary ISO threads than DIN. For 0.125 inch thread pitch (8 threads per inch), the API <b>round</b> <b>thread</b> root radius is 0.017 inch, and the crest radius is 0.020 inch. API threads taper at 3/4 inch of diameter per foot of length.|$|E

40|$|The {{finite element}} models of contact {{problems}} about connectors of buttress and round threads of casing were established with the elasto-plastic FEM of ANSYS software. Under the three flank angles 30, 50 and 100 for the buttress casing connector, the curves that the jump-out loads varied with the loading process were obtained. With the three tapers 1 / 14, 1 / 16 and 1 / 17, for the round casing connector, the curves that the jump-out loads varied with the loading process were obtained. At the same time, the jump-out process of the buttress and <b>round</b> <b>thread</b> connectors was studied, respectively. The average jump-out force of the buttress connector is 594. 1 ton, and however, the average jump-out force of the round connector is 342. 5 ton. That is to say, under the same casing and the same casing size, the connector of the buttress thread {{is not so easy}} to jump out, but the connector of the <b>round</b> <b>thread</b> is very easy to jump out. It provides the theoretical supports for the selection of the casing connectors in the extra-deep well and complex well...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAt {{present it}} is widely {{accepted}} that if gas reservoir pressure is more than 28 MPa, premium connections in production casing should be selected. However, the price of premium connections is about 1. 5 to 2 times than traditional API <b>round</b> <b>thread</b> connections. Therefore, economy and reliability selection of casing thread connections type is one of effective measures to reduce development costs in low –potential gas field. Economy and reliability selection of casing thread connections type in sulige gas field (in China,Well depth at 3550 m, Gas reservoir pressure 35 MPa) was study. Through ϕ 139. 7 × 9. 17 / 7. 72 mm N 80 /J 55 LC casing gas-tight test under complex loads and statistical casing full-scale test data in past were analyzed, a minimum safety factor for casing string gas-tight design was determined by casing strength margin and reliability analysis method. Gas-tight reliability effect of load variability on casing was validated by Monte Carlo method. Two sets of casing string were successfully designed and applied to over 800 wells in the gas field, and all wells were reported running well until now. Over 4 hundred million Yuan(RMB) investment was reduced in developing these wells. Following conclusions were achieved by practice: Casing string of production using API long <b>round</b> <b>thread</b> and CATTS 101 compound instead of premium connection was economical and feasible for low-pressure and low-permeability gas field development. Main effect factors on gas-tight with standoff and pitch were discoverer in full-scale test, which {{was different from the}} current standards on taper in evaluation of gas-tight performance. By statistics of full-scale test data in past, the casing string of design and check is a reliability method with advantage of economic and universal applicability...|$|E
40|$|Based on an {{analysis}} of recent studies of various machining methods the disadvantages of existing methods of internal threads machining have been identified. The proposed method of machining round threads by up to measure tool demonstrated superior performance in comparison with known machining methods. Further study of possible use of up to measure tool in machining other types of threads is an urgent task, the realization of which is necessary to determine of parameters of tool diameter and its motion trajectory.

40|$|Stress Engineering Services (SES) was {{contracted}} by Mr. John Watts to {{test his}} threaded connection developed for oilfield oil and gas service. This particular test required {{the application of a}} variety of loads including axial tension and compression, internal pressure (gas), external pressure (water), bending and both low and elevated temperature. These loads were used to determine the sealing and structural limits of the connection. The connection design tested had tapered threads with 10 threads per inch. A square thread form and a <b>round</b> <b>thread</b> form were tested. The square thread form had a 2 {sup o} load flank and 15 {sup o} stab flank. The <b>round</b> <b>thread</b> had a 0 {sup o} load flank and 20 {sup o} stab flank. Most of the testing was performed on the <b>round</b> <b>thread</b> form. Both a coupled connection design and an integral connection design were tested. The coupling was a pin by pin (male) thread, with the pipe having a box (female) thread. Both designs have outside and inside diameters that are flush with the pipe body. Both designs also contain a small external shoulder. The test procedure selected for this evaluation was the newly written ISO 13679 procedure for full scale testing of casing and tubing connections. The ISO procedure requires a variety of tests that includes makeup/breakout testing, internal gas sealability/external water sealability testing with axial tension, axial compression, bending, internal gas thermal cycle tests and limit load (failure) tests. This test was performed with four coupled samples and included most of these loads. Two integral samples were also included for limit load testing ISO makeup/breakout tests are divided into three types [...] initial makeup, IML 1, repeated makeup within the same sample, MBL, and repeated makeup using several samples called round robin, RR. IMU and MBL were performed in this project. The ISO sealing and structural procedure is divided into four primary tests and identified as Series A, B, C and Limit Load (failure). Series A and B test to 95 % actual yield of the pipe and Series C uses 90 % of actual yield. Samples 1 and 3 were tested to Series A and the loads are shown in Figure 1. For these samples, the axial compression was limited to 75 % pipe body yield, which was set by Mr. Watts {{at the beginning of the}} test. Samples 2 and 4 were tested to Series B with loads shown in Figure 2. This series included 20 degrees per 100 feet bending but no external pressure. Due to premature leaks, no samples were subjected to Series C which included mechanical and thermal cycles. Samples 5 and 6 were tested to failure. The project started with the selection and purchase of a popular size of oilfield pipe, which was 7 -inch OD, 32 pound per foot, P- 110 casing. While the connections were being threaded, material tensile tests were performed to get the actual strength of the 7 -inch pipe. The first samples contained a square thread form. Excessive galling was experienced during the first series of makeup/breakout tests and Mr. Watts decided to change the thread form and remachine the samples. The second samples had a <b>round</b> <b>thread</b> form and performed very well in the makeup/breakout tests. Basically no galling occurred of any consequence. Samples 1 and 3 were to be tested with external water (ISO Series A) while samples 2 and 4 were to be tested with bending (ISO Series B, no external pressure). Testing of all four samples started with tension and internal gas pressure. During this initial pressure testing, samples 1, 3 and 4 developed leaks and the test was stopped before any external pressure or bending was applied. Sample 2 successfully tested to ISO Load Point 5 which included bending before developing a leak. Figure 3 shows the loads at which the samples leaked and the relative pipe body performance capability. Sample 1 and end A of sample 2 held a high pressure while samples 3, 4 and end B of sample 2 leaked at relatively low pressures. All of these leaks were with nitrogen gas pressure. After reviewing the results, it was believed that several conditions may have contributed to the premature leaks: The BOL 2000 thread lubricant contains solid particles that are larger than the solid particles in API 5 A 2 compound. Possibly the large particles prevented tight thread contact necessary for gas leak tightness. The BOL 2000 lubricant may have caused or at least contributed to the yielding of the pin end during makeup. Pin inward deformation was found in some pins subsequent to testing and breakout. Excessive yielding of the pin or box will contribute to poor thread contact and leakage. The connections were made up to full or near full shoulder contact. This causes the end of the pin to be stressed near the yield strength. This along with the interference caused by the thread compound may cause excessive pin hoop stresses and yielding which in turn gives relatively loose thread contact. This behavior is present when repeated makeup and breakout occurs...|$|E

40|$|Great {{economic}} benefit {{will be made}} if a kind of low-cost gas-tight thread can be developed {{on the basis of}} API <b>round</b> <b>thread</b> with a relatively lowest cost to replace the existing premium thread. In this paper, a kind of gas-tight threads was designed and manufactured based on the round threads according to the API Spec 5 B standard. An elastic sealing ring was added {{in the middle of the}} collar, and gas tightness was realized by virtue of the interference matching between the elastic sealing ring and the casing thread. Then, its ultimate bearing capacity was analyzed by using the finite element analysis software MSC. Marc/Mentat. Finally, ISO 13679  B series and C series tests, and tension tests under internal gas pressure in the bending setting were carried out on Ø 73. 02  ×  5. 51  mm J 55 gas-tight threads according to the ISO 13679 standard. It is shown that the gas sealing performance of this gas-tight thread is good, and the results of ultimate internal pressure cycling and the thermal cycling test on sealing pipe ends meet the requirements of ISO 13679. Besides, its internal pressure strength, tensile strength and collapse strength are much higher than those required by GB/T 20657 standard. It is concluded that this type of gas-tight threads can be used in the development of low-pressure gas wells in the Ordos Basin. It has the potential to cut down the casing cost greatly and it can be used as the reference for the design of new gas-tight threads...|$|E
