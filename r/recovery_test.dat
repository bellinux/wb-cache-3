The company hired Canadian astronaut Bjarni Tryggvason, who completed the test flying work. The company announced that flight testing had been completed on 18 November 2016 and that all that remained to finish certification was completing and submitting the paperwork to Transport Canada and raising the funds to commence production.

50|$|The Yo-Yo Intermittent <b>Recovery</b> <b>Test</b> {{is a test}} {{measuring}} an athlete's aerobic {{power and}} execution upon the changing of direction.

The time in between each beep (bar the constant 10second recovery) decreases gradually. If the athlete does not reach the start line in time, a warning is given, and the test is completed when two warnings are given. The total time taken until the two warnings are given, i.e. the test is completed, is what is measured.|$|E

The competitive process took place in a chloroform–hexane 50 % (V/V) mixture, while the subsequent enzymatic final measurement was performed in decane and using tert-butylhydroperoxide as substrate of the enzymatic reaction. A linear response of between about 10 nM and 5. 0 μM was usually obtained in the presence of olive oil. <b>Recovery</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out in commercial or artisanal extra virgin olive oil.

40|$|Physical {{capacity}} is the initial of sport development. To support {{the achievement of}} the purpose of the exercise, needed an instrument evaluation to determine whether there is progression that occurs during exercise program is running. Along with the development of science and technology, a variety of physical capacity assessment instrument to emerge following modification. Interest modifications and developments are based on some adjustments, including physical characteristics; the basic skills of the sport movement; and the specific energy system. Multi Stage Fitness Test and Yo-Yo Intermittent <b>Recovery</b> <b>Test</b> are two types of fitness test that often used to determine athlete's physical capacity, especially related to cardiorespiratory fitness. Although it has similar objectives, but at the time of execution, there are several differences. Objectives to be gained from this research are: knowing the difference in {{the achievement of the}} athlete's VO 2 max; the perception of fatigue; determine the increase of exercise pulse rate; determine levels of blood lactate athletes after Multi stage fitness test and Yo-yo intermittent <b>recovery</b> <b>test.</b> The research design is quasi-experimental research, studies conducted with quantitative approach. Subjects consisted of 13 Basketball athletes. Determination of the study subjects by purposive sampling. The subject of research is basketball athletes who have followed an intensive training program for at least six months. Basketball men's team Senior High School 4 Yogyakarta already has many achievements as a junior athlete at the championship on regional and national level. The results showed: the characteristics of the subjects based on the mean age was 17 years, mean body weight 69 kilograms, and the average height of 175 cm. The result of the athlete's VO 2 max using multistage fitness test lower than Yo-yo intermittent <b>recovery</b> <b>test,</b> the athlete's perception of fatigue multistage fitness test lower than Yo-yo intermittent <b>recovery</b> <b>test.</b> Increased exercise pulse rate athletes to Multi stage fitness test lower than Yo-yo intermittent <b>recovery</b> <b>test.</b> Increased levels of blood lactate athletes after a multistage fitness test lower than Yo-yo intermittent <b>recovery</b> <b>test.</b> Based on the description of the results, it can be concluded that the intensity of Yo-yo intermittent <b>recovery</b> <b>test</b> is higher, because psychologically athletes perceive (use: The Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion/RPE scale) this test is needed high exertion, and physically athletes increased exercise pulse rate and blood lactate higher than after do Multistage fitness test.

40|$|Recovery {{cycle of}} the evoked {{potential}} in the thalamic nuclei was investigated in 18 adult cats under moderate chloralose-urethane anesthesia. Both concentric bipolar electrode and glass-insulated tungsten microelectrode were used to record the amplitude of mass response {{or the number of}} the unit discharge respectively. Stimuli were applied to the peripheral (radial, tibial, peroneal and sural) nerves in the following three different ways : 1) double shocks to a nerve in a extremity, 2) two shocks separately to two different nerve trunks in the same extremity, 3) two shocks separately to two different nerve trunks in the different extremities. It was observed that the time course of the recovery cycle became shorter in the following order : 1) <b>recovery</b> <b>tested</b> by the routine double shock method in the same nerve trunk, 2) <b>recovery</b> <b>tested</b> by the stimuli separately applied to the different nerve trunks in the same extremity, 3) <b>recovery</b> <b>tested</b> by stimuli separately applied to the different nerve trunks in the different extremities. Such an order was also found to exist in the absolute refractoriness. This conclusion is schematically illustrated in Fig. 10 of the text. Different degrees of interference between two responses were discussed {{from the point of view}} that they might be attributed to the different overlapping density in the termination of sensory neurons at the thalamus where sensory afferents have some aspect of somatotopic alignment. The relatively long absolute refractoriness was also discussed in the text and might be explained by the thalamic recurrent inhibitory neurons which were proposed by Andersen and others (1962), to which the present observation also gave further confirmation (Fig. 9) ...|$|R
