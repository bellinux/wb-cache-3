5|$|In fiction, Druitt is {{depicted}} as the murderer in the musical Jack the <b>Ripper</b> by Ron Pember and Denis de Marne. In John Gardner's Sherlock Holmes story The Return of Moriarty, Professor Moriarty's criminal exploits are hampered by increased police activity {{as a result of}} the Jack the <b>Ripper</b> murders. He discovers that Druitt is the murderer and so fakes his suicide in the hope that the police will lose interest once the murders cease. In Alan Moore's graphic novel From Hell, Druitt is portrayed as a patsy for the royal family, made to look guilty of the <b>Ripper</b> murders in order to protect the real killer, Sir William Gull.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Ripper</b> murders mark an {{important}} watershed {{in the treatment}} of crime by journalists. Jack the <b>Ripper</b> was not the first serial killer, but his case was the first to create a worldwide media frenzy. Tax reforms in the 1850s had enabled the publication of inexpensive newspapers with wider circulation. These mushroomed in the later Victorian era to include mass-circulation newspapers as cheap as a halfpenny, along with popular magazines such as The Illustrated Police News which made the <b>Ripper</b> the beneficiary of previously unparalleled publicity.|$|E
5|$|The {{conspiracy}} theory outlined in Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution is fictionalised {{in the play}} Force and Hypocrisy by Doug Lucie. Four films have used elements of the theory: Murder by Decree, Jack the <b>Ripper,</b> The <b>Ripper,</b> and the Hughes Brothers' From Hell, {{which was based on}} a graphic novel of the same name by Alan Moore and artist Eddie Campbell.|$|E

5|$|There is no waxwork {{figure of}} Jack the <b>Ripper</b> at Madame Tussauds' Chamber of Horrors, unlike murderers of lesser fame, in {{accordance}} with their policy of not modelling persons whose likeness is unknown. He is instead depicted as a shadow. In 2006, BBC History magazine and its readers selected Jack the <b>Ripper</b> as the worst Briton in history.|$|E

5|$|McKenzie {{was killed}} on 17 July 1889 by {{severance}} of the left carotid artery. Several minor bruises and cuts {{were found on the}} body, discovered in Castle Alley, Whitechapel. One of the examining pathologists, Thomas Bond, believed this to be a <b>Ripper</b> murder, though his colleague George Bagster Phillips, who had examined the bodies of three previous victims, disagreed. Later writers are also divided between those who think that her murderer copied the Ripper's modus operandi to deflect suspicion from himself, and those who ascribe it to the <b>Ripper.</b>|$|E
5|$|Montague John Druitt (15 August 1857– early December 1888) {{was one of}} the {{suspects}} in the Jack the <b>Ripper</b> murders that took place in London between August and November 1888.|$|E

5|$|Though Stowell's {{hypothesis}} was incorrect, his article rekindled {{interest in the}} Jack the <b>Ripper</b> case, and in 1973 the BBC launched a television series, Jack the <b>Ripper,</b> which investigated the Whitechapel murders. The series mixed documentary and drama; it featured real evidence but was hosted by fictional detectives Barlow and Watt, played by Stratford Johns and Frank Windsor, respectively. The series {{was made into a}} book, The <b>Ripper</b> File, by Elwyn Jones and John Lloyd in 1975. The sixth and final programme included a testimony by Joseph Gorman, who called himself Joseph Sickert and claimed to be the illegitimate son of noted painter Walter Sickert. Gorman claimed that Sickert had told him a story that implicated not only the royal family but also a host of other famous people in the murders. According to Gorman, Gull committed the murders with the help of accomplices. Stowell had mentioned rumours implicating Gull in his article, but had dismissed them as unfair and false.|$|E
5|$|Chief Constable Dewar sent a {{telegraph}} {{detailing the}} circumstances of the crime to the London Metropolitan Police, which was investigating the crimes attributed to Jack the <b>Ripper.</b> Detectives from London did not consider Bury a realistic suspect in their investigation into the <b>Ripper</b> murders, but Inspector Frederick Abberline did interview witnesses in Whitechapel connected to Bury, including William's former employer James Martin and landlords Elizabeth Haynes and William Smith. According to the executioner James Berry and crime reporter Norman Hastings, Scotland Yard sent two detectives to interview Bury, but there is no surviving record of the visit in the police archive.|$|E

5|$|The {{accusations against}} Clarence, Stephen, Gull and Druitt also draw on {{cultural}} {{perceptions of a}} decadent ruling class, and depict a high-born murderer or murderers preying on lower-class victims. Because Druitt and the other upper-middle-class and aristocratic <b>Ripper</b> suspects were wealthy, there is more biographical material on them than on {{the residents of the}} Whitechapel slums. Consequently, it is easier for writers to construct solutions based on a wealthy culprit rather than one involving a Whitechapel resident. There is no direct evidence against Druitt, and since the 1970s, the number of Jack the <b>Ripper</b> suspects has continued to grow, with the result that there are now over 100 different theories about the Ripper's identity.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} Whitechapel Road is notorious for the 19th century Whitechapel murders, which are {{believed}} to be linked to Jack the <b>Ripper.</b> One of the first victims was Martha Tabram, who was found with multiple stab wounds on George Yard Buildings, Whitechapel Road on 7 August 1888.|$|E

5|$|The {{nature of}} the murders and of the victims drew {{attention}} to the poor living conditions in the East End and galvanised public opinion against the overcrowded, unsanitary slums. In the two decades after the murders, the worst of the slums were cleared and demolished, but the streets and some buildings survive and the legend of the <b>Ripper</b> is still promoted by guided tours of the murder sites. The Ten Bells public house in Commercial Street was frequented by {{at least one of the}} victims and was the focus of such tours for many years. In 2015, the Jack the <b>Ripper</b> Museum opened in east London.|$|E
