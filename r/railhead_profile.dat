Worn mainline rails usually have sufficient life remaining to be used on a branch line, siding or stub afterwards and are [...] "cascaded" [...] to those applications.|$|E
40|$|The {{railhead}} {{is severely}} stressed under the localized wheel contact patch {{close to the}} gaps in insulated rail joints. A modified <b>railhead</b> <b>profile</b> {{in the vicinity of}} the gapped joint, through a shape optimization model based on a coupled genetic algorithm and finite element method, effectively alters the contact zone and reduces the railhead edge stress concentration significantly. Two optimization methods, a grid search method and a genetic algorithm, were employed for this optimization problem. The optimal results from these two methods are discussed and, in particular, their suitability for the rail end stress minimization problem is studied. Through several numerical examples, the optimal profile is shown to be unaffected by either the magnitude or the contact position of the loaded wheel. The numerical results are validated through a large-scale experimental study...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{both time}} and {{frequency}} domain approaches {{are applied to}} a corrugated, curved, ballasted track section located in the RER commuter rail network in Paris. From the <b>railhead</b> <b>profile</b> measurements, two corrugation wavelengths are identified on the low rail. The wavelength fixing mechanisms are found to correlate to a resonance of the concrete sleepers and a resonance of the unsprung mass of the vehicle on the track stiffness. Corrugation growth rates are established from both approaches and compared. Then, an extensive parameter study is performed in order to evaluate the relevance of various parameters and to identify viable solutions for mitigating the observed corrugation. Specifically we examine the impact on rail corrugation due to the following track parameters: the vertical and lateral rail pad stiffness, the sleeper mass and the superelevation. © 2008 C.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{possibilities}} of improvement of the vehicle guiding behaviour in curves of small radius (300 m and less) through the modification of the wheelset/track coupling. Due to the unsuitable contact conditions between the wheel and rail {{there is a place}} of the slipwave creation {{at the head of the}} inner rail and intensive side wear of the outer rail. Special <b>railhead</b> <b>profiles</b> could be one of the possible solutions to sinking the force effect between vehicle and track. Except design of the <b>railhead</b> <b>profiles,</b> first results from the operation are presented...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that track defects cause {{profound}} effects to the dynamics of railway wagons; normally such problems are examined for cases of wagons running at a constant speed. Brake/traction torques affect the speed profile due to the wheel–rail contact characteristics but most of the wagon–track interaction models do not explicitly consider them in simulation. The authors have recently published a model for the dynamics of wagons subject to braking traction torques on a perfect track by explicitly considering the pitch degree of freedom for wheelsets. The model is extended for cases of lateral and vertical track geometry defects and worn <b>railhead</b> and wheel <b>profiles.</b> This paper presents the results of the analyses carried out using the model extended to the dynamics of wagons containing less ideal wheel profiles running on tracks with geometry defects and worn rails...|$|R
40|$|Wear {{and crack}} {{initiation}} of steel rails {{is a problem}} of great significance to the railway industry. A high wear rate shortens the life of rails and the frequent rail replacement is expensive in terms not only of resources but also of track access time and delays affecting timetables. In addition, railhead profiles change gradually as the rails are worn and the greater the wear rate, the more often the rails need to be reground to maintain good train running performance. In contrast, a low wear rate means that cracks have time to develop in the plastically deformed rail steel and these may propagate deeper into the rails with potentially disastrous consequences. Finding the optimum combination of wear and grinding to maintain <b>railhead</b> <b>profile</b> and prevent cracks from growing is key to running a safe and cost-efficient railway. The large number of variables arising from track geometry, train dynamics, and wheel and rail profiles leads to wide variation in contact patch size and location. The two-dimensional model of ratcheting wear developed by Kapoor et al. has been developed to model the damage accumulation near the surface of the rail {{on the basis of a}} full three-dimensional contact stress distribution. Different rail steel microstructures can also be modelled and the effects of microstructure on wear and crack initiation are explored...|$|E
40|$|Insulated Rail Joints (IRJs) are safety {{critical}} component of the automatic block signalling and broken rail detection systems. IRJs exhibit several failure modes due to complex interaction between the railhead ends and the wheel tread near the gap. These localised zones could not be monitored using automatic sensing devices and hence are resorted to visual inspection only, which is error prone and expensive. In Australia alone currently there are 50, 000 IRJs across 80, 000 km of rail track. The significance of the problem around the world could thus be realised as there exists one IRJ for each 1. 6 km track length. IRJs exhibit extremely low and variable service life; further the track substructure underneath IRJs degrade faster. Thus presence of the IRJs incur significant costs to track maintenance. IRJ failures have also contributed to some train derailments and various traffic disruptions in rail lines. This paper reports a systematic research carried out over seven years on the mechanical behaviour of IRJs for practically relevant outcomes. The research has scientifically established that stiffening the track bed for reduction in impact force is an ill-conceived concept and the most effective method {{is to reduce the}} gap size. Further it is established that hardening the railhead ends through laser coating (or other) cannot adequately address the metal flow problem in the long run; modification of the <b>railhead</b> <b>profile</b> is the only appropriate technique to completely eliminate the problem. Part of these outcomes has been adopted by the rail infrastructure owners in Australia...|$|E
40|$|Proper {{functioning}} of Insulated Rail Joints (IRJs) {{is essential for}} the safe operation of the railway signalling systems and broken rail identification circuitries. The Conventional IRJ (CIRJ) resembles structural butt joints consisting of two pieces of rails connected together through two joint bars on either side of their web and the assembly is held together through pre-tensioned bolts. As the IRJs should maintain electrical insulation between the two rails, a gap between the rail ends must be retained at all times and all metal contacting surfaces should be electrically isolated from each other using non-conductive material. At the gap, the rail ends lose longitudinal continuity and hence the vertical sections of the rail ends are often severely damaged, especially at the railhead, due to the passage of wheels compared to other continuously welded rail sections. Fundamentally, the reason for the severe damage can be related to the singularities of the wheel-rail contact pressure and the railhead stress. No new generation designs that have emerged in the market to date have focussed on this fundamental; they only have provided attention to either the higher strength materials or the thickness of the sections of various components of the IRJs. In this thesis a novel method of shape optimisation of the railhead is developed to eliminate the pressure and stress singularities through changes to the original sharp corner shaped railhead into an arc profile in the longitudinal direction. The optimal shape of the longitudinal <b>railhead</b> <b>profile</b> has been determined using three nongradient methods in search of accuracy and efficiency: (1) Grid Search Method; (2) Genetic Algorithm Method and (3) Hybrid Genetic Algorithm Method. All these methods have been coupled with a parametric finite element formulation for the evaluation of the objective function for each iteration or generation depending on the search algorithm employed. The optimal shape derived from these optimisation methods is termed as Stress Minimised Railhead (SMRH) in this thesis. This optimal SMRH design has exhibited significantly reduced stress concentration that remains well below the yield strength of the head hardened rail steels and has shifted the stress concentration location away from the critical zone of the railhead end. The reduction in the magnitude and the relocation of the stress concentration in the SMRH design has been validated through a full scale wheel – railhead interaction test rig; Railhead strains under the loaded wheels have been recorded using a non-contact digital image correlation method. Experimental study has confirmed the accuracy of the numerical predications. Although the SMRH shaped IRJs eliminate stress singularities, they can still fail due to joint bar or bolt hole cracking; therefore, another conceptual design, termed as Embedded IRJ (EIRJ) in this thesis, with no joint bars and pre-tensioned bolts has been developed using a multi-objective optimisation formulation based on the coupled genetic algorithm – parametric finite element method. To achieve the required structural stiffness for the safe passage of the loaded wheels, the rails were embedded into the concrete of the post tensioned sleepers; the optimal solutions for the design of the EIRJ is shown to simplify the design through the elimination of the complex interactions and failure modes of the various structural components of the CIRJ. The practical applicability of the optimal shapes SMRH and EIRJ is demonstrated through two illustrative examples, termed as improved designs (IMD 1 & IMD 2) in this thesis; IMD 1 is a combination of the CIRJ and the SMRH designs, whilst IMD 2 is a combination of the EIRJ and SMRH designs. These two improved designs have been simulated for two key operating (speed and wagon load) and design (wheel diameter) parameters that affect the wheel-rail contact; the effect of these parameters {{has been found to be}} negligible to the performance of the two improved designs and the improved designs are in turn found far superior to the current designs of the CIRJs in terms of stress singularities and deformation under the passage of the loaded wheels. Therefore, these improved designs are expected to provide longer service life in relation to the CIRJs...|$|E
