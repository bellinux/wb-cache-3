30|$|Education {{activities}} provide {{context to}} help the community understand what the regulation is, why it is in place and, perhaps, {{what happens if the}} regulation is contravened. Passive education performs an ‘informing’ function and does not necessarily target a particular segment of the community nor does it necessarily compel anybody to act in a particular way. Active educational approaches on the other hand perform an ‘advising’ function, these educational messages being sensitive to cultural or other local contexts and therefore typically target specific groups with relevant messages, therefore arguably able to better influence particular compliance outcomes. General compliance activities on the other hand prepare council to undertake its responsibilities in executing its duties under the Act. These enabling activities usually take place ‘behind the scenes’, often essential functions to allow the education and enforcement activities of council to take place. Common compliance activities include the maintenance of registration databases, training <b>of</b> <b>authorised</b> <b>officers</b> and activities undertaken by council officers to gain an understanding and appreciation of their community’s needs.|$|R

At about 12:00 Van Overstraeten ordered the Belgian border troops to rebuild the barriers and reminded them of the standing order to [...] "repulse by force any foreign unit of whatever nationality which violated Belgian territory".
