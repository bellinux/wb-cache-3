50|$|The {{engine is}} {{designed}} to operate at a constant speed, no matter the thrust output—a characteristic permitted by the Astafan's use of precise fuel metering and fan blade pitch adjustment. To control the engine, the pilot first sets the speed lever, which adjusts fuel flow {{in proportion to the}} selected engine speed. Then the pilot moves the thrust lever (analogous to a throttle), actuating the fan pitch piston by way of a mechanical linkage and hydraulic valve, and varying the blade pitch. In response, the speed governor holds engine speed steady by adjusting fuel delivery to the combustor. The control system also monitors turbine temperature and adjusts blade pitch (and therefore engine load) to maintain it within the preferred range of 350 °C to 450 °C. Additionally, the system automatically protects against excessive fuel delivery or unusual changes in blade pitch. Using the thrust lever, pilots can start an Astafan in fine pitch (for minimal <b>resistive</b> <b>torque),</b> select takeoff (coarse) pitch, feather the fan, or even reverse the fan pitch in flight (with the fan providing reverse thrust in lieu of conventional reversers).|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Many {{studies have}} been {{undertaken}} to define the effects of static and ballistic stretching. However, most researchers have focused their attention on joint range-of-motion measures. The objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate whether static- and ballistic-stretching programs had different effects on passive <b>resistive</b> <b>torque</b> measured during isokinetic passive motion of the ankle joint and tendon stiffness measured by ultrasound imaging. Methods: Eighty-one healthy subjects were randomized into three groups: a static-stretch group, a ballistic-stretch group, and a control group. Both stretching groups performed a 6 -wk stretching program for the calf muscles. Before and after this period, all subjects were evaluated for ankle range of motion, passive <b>resistive</b> <b>torque</b> of the plantar flexors, and the stiffness of the Achilles tendon. Results: The results of the study reveal that the dorsiflexion range of motion was increased significantly in all groups. Static stretching resulted in a significant decrease of the passive <b>resistive</b> <b>torque,</b> but there was no change in Achilles tendon stiffness. In contrast, ballistic stretching had no significant effect on the passive <b>resistive</b> <b>torque</b> of the plantar flexors. However, a significant decrease in stiffness of the Achilles tendon was observed in the ballistic-stretch group. Conclusion: These findings provide evidence that static and ballistic stretching have different effects on passive <b>resistive</b> <b>torque</b> and tendon stiffness, and both types of stretching should be considered for training and rehabilitation programs...|$|E

In this study, a myoelectrically controlled robotic system with 1 degree-of-freedom was developed to assist elbow training in a horizontal plane with intention involvement for people after stroke. The system could provide continuous assistance in extension torque, which was proportional to the amplitude of the subject’s electromyographic (EMG) signal from the triceps, and could provide <b>resistive</b> <b>torques</b> during movement. This study investigated the system’s effect on restoring the upper limb functions of eight subjects after chronic stroke in a twenty-session rehabilitation training program. In each session, there were 18 trials comprising different combinations of assistive and <b>resistive</b> <b>torques</b> and an evaluation trial. Each trial consisted of five cycles of repetitive elbow flexion and extension between 90 ° and 0 ° at a constant velocity of 10 °/s. With the assistive extension torque, subjects could reach a more extended position in the first session. After 20 sessions of training, there were statistically significant improvements in the modified Ashworth scale, Fugl–Meyer scale for shoulder and elbow, motor status scale, elbow extension range, muscle strength, and root mean square error between actual elbow angle and target angle.

40|$|Abstract — With {{increasing}} {{populations of}} the elderly in our society, robot technology will {{play an important role}} in providing functional mobility to humans. From the perspective of human safety, it is desirable that controllers for walk-assist robots be dissipative, i. e., the energy is supplied from the human to the walker, while the controller modulates this energy. The simplest form of a dissipating controller is a brake, where <b>resistive</b> <b>torques</b> are applied to the wheels proportional to their speeds. The fundamental question that we ask in this brief is how to modulate these proportional gains over time for the two wheels so that the walker can perform point-to-point motions. The unique contribution of this brief is a novel way in which the theory of differential flatness is used to plan the trajectory of these braking gains. Since the user input forces are not known a priori, the trajectory of the braking gain is computed iteratively during the motion. Simulation and experimental results show that the walk-assist robot, along with the structure of this proposed control scheme, can guide the user to reach the goal.

40|$|Introduction: The ankle sprain {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{injuries}} in athletes. Direct evaluation of the ligament laxity can be obtained through the objective measurement of extreme passive inversion and eversion movements, but there are few studies on the use of the evaluation of the passive <b>resistive</b> <b>torque</b> of the ankle to assess the capsule and ligaments resistance. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the inversion and eversion passive torque in athletes with and without ankle sprains history. Method: 32 female basketball and volleyball athletes (16. 06 +/- 0. 8 years old; 67. 63 +/- 8. 17 kg; 177. 8 +/- 6. 47 cm) participated in this study. Their ankles were divided into two groups: control group (29), composed of symptom-free ankles, and ankle sprain group, composed of ankles which have suffered injury (29). The <b>resistive</b> <b>torque</b> at maximum passive ankle movement was measured by the isokinetic dynamometer and the muscular activity by electromyography system. The athletes performed 2 repetitions of inversion and eversion movement at 5, 10 and 20 degrees/s and the same protocol only at maximum inversion movement. Results: The resistive passive torque during the inversion and eversion was lower in the ankle sprain group. This group also showed lower torques at the maximum inversion movement. No differences were observed between inversion and eversion movement.

Clinical results with these options have shown variable success rates and significant higher rates of aseptic loosening and mechanical failures with constrained implants. Literature suggests potential advantages of dual mobility, however {{little is known about}} its biomechanics. We present a comparative biomechanical study of a standard implant, a constrained implant, and a dual mobility system. A finite element analysis was developed to assess and compare these acetabular options with regard to the range of motion (ROM) to impingement, the angle of dislocation, the <b>resistive</b> <b>torque,</b> the volume of polyethylene (PE) with a stress above 80 % of the elastic limit, and the interfacial cup/bone stress.

Dual mobility also demonstrated the lowest <b>resistive</b> <b>torque</b> at subluxation while the constrained implant provided the greatest one. The lowest critical PE volume was observed with the dual mobility implant, and the highest stress at the interfaces was observed with the constrained implant.

40|$|Motion capture {{has become}} a premiere {{technique}} for animation of humanlike characters. To facilitate its use, researchers {{have focused on the}} manipulation of data for retargeting, editing, combining, and reusing motion capture libraries. In many of these efforts joint angle plus root trajectories are used as input, although this format requires an inherent mapping from the raw data recorded by many popular motion capture set-ups.

40|$|I {{consider}} {{plate tectonics}} as the Earth Sciences discipline {{that describes the}} geodynamic evolution of the lithosphere, coupled with the underlying “fluid” mantle, over long time intervals, {{of the order of}} million years. Such a description, which includes plate kinematics, mantle dynamics, and the geology of plate boundaries, is based on a variety of data from marine geophysics, paleomagnetism, seismology, structural geology, stratigraphy, paleontology, and geochemistry. Therefore, although traditionally plate tectonics has been considered either as synonymous with plate kinematics (by most geophysicists) or a discipline describing the structural geology of plate boundaries (by many geologists), I will try to present an integrated approach to this science, introducing concepts from most of the research fields listed above. In fact, despite the modern society drives young scientists toward exasperated specialization, it is my firm opinion that a true expertise in plate tectonics should be based on a holistic view of the geological processes. This textbook evolved from a series of courses that I taught over the last years at the University of Camerino, Italy, to students enrolled in the MSc programme in Geoenvironmental Resources & Risks. These students had a background in geology, geography, engineering, or physics, a level ranging from advanced undergraduate to graduate, and came from four continents. For many geology, geophysics, and environmental engineering students, knowledge of plate tectonics is generally qualitative and limits to a few consolidated principles and to some rudiments about plate boundary processes. This book was born from the idea that a number of students could be stimulated to undertake a more thorough study of plate tectonics after having acquired basic skills in introductory courses. For these people, attaining an in–depth knowledge of the physics of plate tectonic processes through a rigorous approach based on mathematical methods will be a pleasant adventure, not a boring exercise. In fact, any student that strives for understanding the nature of the forces that drive the large–scale geological processes is naturally led to consider mathematics as a fundamental method for describing the natural processes in their generality, not only as a tool for solving practical problems. This book can also be useful for researchers specialized in one of the several disciplines of geosciences, who have the necessity to learn techniques of plate tectonic modelling or simply desire to expand their knowledge. Unfortunately, {{with the exception of the}} classic volume published by Le Pichon, Francheteau & Bonnin in 1973, there are no advanced books where a student can learn quantitative methods of plate tectonics and find a unified description of the laws that govern the motion of tectonic plates. This book attempts to fill the gap by first exploring the principles of plate kinematics in the first part (Chapters 1 – 6), then trying to link plate motions to physical processes occurring in the lithosphere and the mantle in the second part (Chapters 7 – 14). In order to be self–contained, the book includes three chapters (8, 9, and 10) that illustrate the basic principles of seismology, because this discipline represents a fundamental source of data for plate tectonics. Throughout the book, it is assumed that the reader has an adequate background in geology, geochemistry, and classic physics, while skills in computer programming are required for solving some exercises. With a few exceptions, reading this book does not require more mathematical background than the customary undergraduate courses in advanced calculus and vector analysis. As an aid to reading, two electronic appendices introduce vector analysis and algorithms. Finally, a basic understanding of plate tectonics at the level of the classic book of Cox & Hart (1986) is desirable. Some exercises have been designed to be solved with the help of professional software, either freeware or commercial. These software tools include two free computer programs that I designed for the analysis of marine magnetic anomalies and for making plate tectonic reconstructions, respectively Magan, and PlaKin. Readers can freely download the software either to learn some techniques or for their own research purposes. The special emphasis I give to computer methods shows through some chapters of this book and is clearly a consequence of my heterogeneous scientific background. Although I studied theoretical physics, my passion for computer programming led me to start working as a software developer and consultant in Milan, Italy, soon after my graduation. However, even in those days I maturated a strong scientific interest in the application of advanced algorithms to geosciences, in particular to plate kinematics. During that period, I designed and developed PCME (Paleo–Continental Map Editor) (Schettino, 1998), an interactive computer program for making plate reconstructions. This event led me to get in touch with C. R. Scotese, a scientist who pioneered the application of computer methods to plate kinematics. At that time he was at the University of Texas at Arlington, and I started collaborating with him to the construction of a new atlas of plate tectonic reconstructions for the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic in the context of the Paleomap Project, as well as to the implementation of a series of advanced software tools for plate tectonic modelling. Starting from the beginning of the new millennium, my research interests focused on paleomagnetism, marine geophysics, plate kinematics at global and regional scale, and on the dynamics of subduction. The general conclusion at which I arrived during my studies, which is now a guiding principle in my approach to the analysis of plate tectonic processes, can be summarized as follows. For time intervals of several million years, tectonic plates move at constant angular velocity about stationary axes of rotation in any geocentric reference frame fixed with respect to the Earth’s spin axis. Therefore, conditions of dynamic equilibrium must normally exist between driving and <b>resistive</b> <b>torques</b> exerted on the lithosphere. Such a global equilibrium is broken when new plate boundaries form, or existing ones become extinct, so that a new system of tectonic plates is established. Then, the plates of this new system start moving about new, generally different, rotation axes and with different angular velocities. New plate boundaries always form by propagation of lithospheric discontinuities from a source region toward existing active boundaries, where they will give rise to additional triple junctions. Occasionally, plate motions proceed in non–equilibrium conditions, because active asthenospheric flows driven by horizontal pressure gradients in the mantle exert an excess basal drag on the overlying lithosphere, determining significant variations of angular velocity and accelerated motion. In this instance, high spreading and subduction rates accompany the plate motions. The ultimate cause of such episodes of non–equilibrium plate kinematics is the presence of upper mantle thermo–chemical heterogeneities, in particular mantle plumes and subducted slabs. Plate motions that proceed in conditions of perturbed equilibrium are associated with spectacular and sometimes unexplained geological phenomena, but these events are uncommon in the history of global plate motions and must be viewed as the exception rather than the rule. Therefore, the equilibrium between driving and <b>resistive</b> <b>torques</b> exerted on the lithosphere, and the resulting invariance of the angular velocity vectors of tectonic plates for long time intervals, should be considered as one of the most fundamental laws of plate tectonics. I would like to thank my students of the Earth Physics course, a. a. 2013 / 2014, for the many errors found in a draft of Chapter 2 and for their stimulating questions. I would also thank colleagues with whom I worked for several years on plate kinematics, especially C. R. Scotese and Eugenio Turco. I am honored to have learnt so many things from these people. I am also grateful to Giorgio Ranalli (Carleton University), Marco Ligi (ISMAR–CNR Bologna), and Eugenio Turco (University of Camerino) for the help I received through their constructive criticism and useful suggestions during the review of this book. If errors persist in this edition, it is not their fault but a consequence of my negligence.

Stiffness is quantified in terms of dissipated energy, equilibrium position and absolute <b>resistive</b> <b>torque</b> measured from the equilibrium position. Three groups of experiments are reported. The first investigates the circadian variation of stiffness in normal subjects. The second investigates stiffness in normal subjects and patients with rheumatoid arthritis and the third looks at the effects of various techniques of physiotherapy in altering stiffness. The results show a circadian variation of stiffness with increased stiffness {{in the early hours of}} the morning. Male subjects exhibit higher dissipated energy than female subjects though no statistically significant differences could be found in other stiffness parameters. Within the range of values tested no statistically significant differences could be found between controls and patients in dissipated energy, <b>resistive</b> <b>torque</b> or equilibrium position. Correlation of these characteristics with other parameters, for example, grip strength and limb circumference has identified differences between controls and patients, and it is concluded that, in rheumatoid arthritis, stiffness mainly results from the involvement of immediate soft tissue periarticular structures. The effects of physiotherapeutic techniques, usually administered to alleviate stiffness, are shown to be variable. Short wave diathermy and ultrasound effected a reduction in dissipated energy in the patient group and it is concluded that a reduction in the viscous and frictional properties of periarticular structures produces this effect. A shift in the equilibrium position is also shown to occur in this group following the application of short wave diathermy. Paraffin wax baths, ice and exercises had no effect on stiffness in the patient group and no treatment technique produced significant effects in the control group...|$|E

The key features of AKROD include: a compact, lightweight design with highly tunable torque capabilities through a variable damper component, full portability with on board power, control circuitry, and sensors (encoder and torque), and realtime capabilities for closed loop computer control for optimizing gait retraining. The variable damper component is achieved through an electro-rheological fluid (ERF) element that connects to the output of the gear system. Using the electrically controlled rheological properties of ERFs, compact brakes capable of supplying high <b>resistive</b> and controllable <b>torques,</b> are developed. A preliminary prototype for AKROD v. 2 has been developed and tested in our laboratory. AKROD’s v. 2 ERF resistive actuator was tested in laboratory experiments using our custom made ERF Testing Apparatus (ETA). ETA provides a computer controlled environment to test ERF brakes and actuators in various conditions and scenarios including emulating the interaction between human muscles involved with the knee and AKROD’s ERF actuators / brakes. In our preliminary results, AKROD’s ERF resistive actuator was tested in closed loop torque control experiments. A hybrid (non-linear, adaptive) Proportional-Integral (PI) torque controller was implemented to achieve this goal.

40|$|Autonomous micro-swimming robots can be {{utilized}} to perform specialized procedures {{such as in}} vitro or in vivo medical tasks as well as chemical surveillance or micro manipulation. Maneuverability of the robot {{is one of the}} requirements that ensure successful completion of its task. In micro fluidic environments, dynamic trajectories of active micro-swimming robots must be predicted reliably and the response of control inputs must be well-understood. In this work, a reduced-order model, which is based on the resistive force theory, is used to predict the transient, coupled rigid body dynamics and hydrodynamic behavior of bio-inspired artificial micro-swimmers. Conceptual design of the micro-swimmer is biologically inspired: it is composed of a body that carries a payload, control and actuation mechanisms, and a long flagellum either such as an inextensible whip like tail-actuator that deforms and propagates sinusoidal planar waves similar to spermatozoa, or of a rotating rigid helix similar to many bacteria, such as E. Coli. In the reduced-order model of the microswimmer, fluid’s resistance to the motion of the body and the tail are computed from resistive force theory, which breaks up the resistance coefficients to local normal and tangential components. Using rotational transformations between a fixed world frame, body frame and the local Frenet-Serret coordinates on the helical tail we obtain the full 6 degrees-of-freedom relationship between the <b>resistive</b> forces and <b>torques</b> and the linear and rotational motions of the swimmer. In the model, only the tail’s frequency (angular velocity for helical tail) is used as a control input in the dynamic equations of the micro-swimming robot. The reduced-order model is validated by means of direct observations of natural micro swimmers presented earlier in the literature and against; results show very good agreement. Three-dimensional, transient CFD simulations of a single degree of freedom swimmer is used to predict resistive force coefficients of a micro-swimmer with a spherical body and flexible tail actuator that uses traveling plane wave deformations for propulsion. Modified coefficients show a very good agreement between the predicted and actual time-dependent swimming speeds, as well as forces and torques along all axes...|$|R
40|$|Functional ankle instability, orthoses, {{and passive}} resis-tive torque tolerated {{have not been}} researched. The pur-pose {{of the study was}} to {{evaluate}} the passive resistance torque exerted by a flexible and semirigid orthosis for individuals with chronic instability. Twenty-two subjects were evaluated on the passive ankle resistance unit dur-ing unbraced, flexible, and semirigid brace conditions. Data from the final three trials for each condition were analyzed using a multiple analysis of variance with re-peated measures for <b>resistive</b> <b>torque</b> and inversion range of motion. The semirigid and flexible braces toler-ated significantly greater torque forces and less inver-sion range than the unbraced condition (P < 0. 000). Ex-ternal orthotic support, in particular that of a semirigid orthosis, may be beneficial toward reducing injury or be an effective prophylactic for the healthy population...|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to investigate the effect of movement repetitions on <b>resistive</b> <b>torque</b> during passive isokinetic dynamometry of the knee and to determine the role of electromyographic activity in the stretched muscles on the torque measurements. Ten persons with multiple sclerosis and hypertonia of the knee muscles were compared with 10 healthy age- and gender-matched control subjects. During series of 10 flexion and extension movements of the knee at 60, 180 and 300 degrees/s, torque and electromyographic activity in the stretched muscles were registered. The persons with hypertonia presented a significantly larger torque reduction (p < 0. 05) than the control subjects in all test conditions except for repeated knee flexion at 300 degrees/s. Electromyographic activity in the stretched muscles was not identified as the only explanatory mechanism for the reduction in hypertonia during the movement repetitions, suggesting that other factors were also involved. status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|In {{the current}} study, we tested a {{prototype}} of an isokinetic exercise device for the lower limbs, named the ERIK. The ERIK enables a type of single-limb squat exercise with a translational load on the swing leg in a closed kinetic chain, putting load on {{the muscles of the}} stance leg in the standing position. This training applies load to the gluteal muscles, which is effective for avoiding excessive knee valgus moment, a major factor in anterior cruciate ligament injuries. To enhance the quality of the load, an electro-rheological (ER) fluid brake system is implemented in the ERIK. The ER brake can reversibly control <b>resistive</b> <b>torque</b> with a rapid response. This paper reports {{a prototype of}} the device with four training modes, verifying its performance through basic experiments. Although high resistance is created within a wide motion area and requires isokinetic training by controlling the velocity of the trainee’s legs, the ERIK has the advantage of a high level of safety because of its passive resistive function.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Rotating Magnetic Fields (RMF) {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} to drive currents in many rotamak experiments, but use with an FRC confined in a flux conserver imposes special constraints. The strong current drive force results in a near zero density at the separatrix, and the high average beta condition requires the current to be carried in an edge layer near the separatrix. The RMF can only penetrate into this layer by driving the azimuthal electron velocity synchronous with the RMF frequency. Build-up or maintenance of the flux throughout the FRC occurs due to the torque imposed on the electrons in this layer exceeding the total <b>resistive</b> <b>torque</b> due to electron-ion friction. Current is maintained on the inner flux surfaces by an inward radial flow. Particle balance is maintained by a swirling axial flow from inner to outer field lines. This process is seen using a new numerical code, and the resultant flux build-up and calculated profiles are demonstrated on the STX and TCS RMF FRC formation experiments. 1...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: Ankle joint {{stiffness}} and its {{range of motion}} (ROM) are commonly assessed to determine the appropriate mechanical characteristics required in an effective ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) prescription. The aim of this technical note is to present {{the design of a}} manual device that enables their convenient measurement in the clinical setting and to demonstrate its reliability. Technique: The manual device was designed with a torquemeter, a potentiometer, a steering wheel, a rotary plate, and a foot plate. The measurement of <b>resistive</b> <b>torque</b> at 0 ° (neutral), 5 ° (dorsiflexion) and 10 ° (dorsiflexion) ankle angular positions demonstrated the high reliability of the device with Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) (1,k) values over 0. 97. Discussion: Quantitative measurement of ankle joint {{stiffness and}} ROM by this manual device would provide objective information that could potentially assist AFO prescriptions. A future study should investigate how to incorporate the measurement obtained from the device into the prescription of an AFO...|$|E
40|$|This {{article was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the Journal of Vibration and Acoustics, and the definitive version is available at: [URL] new modelling approach on the torsional dynamics of hypoid gear pairs is presented in this work. The current formulation is characterised by an alternative expression of the Dynamic Transmission Error (DTE), accounting for the variation of the effective mesh position. Speed dependent <b>resistive</b> <b>torque</b> is introduced on the gear wheel, enabling the system to reach dynamic equilibrium based on realistic vehicle operating conditions. The above are supplementing past research studies, where simplifications were introduced in the calculation of DTE, while the operating angular velocity was defined a priori. The analysis is accompanied by numerical results, indicating the rich dynamic behavior captured by the new formulation. The dynamic complexity of the system necessitates {{the identification of the}} various response regimes. A solution continuation method (software AUTO) is employed to follow the stable/unstable periodic response branches over the operating range of the differential under examination...|$|E
40|$|Although speed-accuracy {{trade-offs}} {{and planning}} {{and execution of}} rapid goaldirected movements have garnered significant research interest, far fewer studies have reported results on {{the lower end of}} the movement speed spectrum. Not only do very interesting observations exist that are unique to slow movements, but an explanation of these observations is highly relevant to motor function recovery and motor skill learning, where movements are typically slow at the initiation of therapy or learning, and movement speed increases through practice, exercise or therapy. In the first part of this thesis, based on data from nine stroke patients who underwent a month-long hybrid traditional and robotic therapy protocol, a correlation analysis shows that measures of movement quality based on minimum jerk theory for movement planning correlates significantly and strongly with clinical measures of motor impairment. In contrast, measures of movement speed lack statistical significance and show only weak to moderate correlations with clinical measures. These results constitute an important step towards establishing a much-needed bridge between clinical and robotic rehabilitation research communities. In the second part, the origins of movement intermittency or variability in slow movements are explored. A study with five healthy subjects who completed a manual circular tracking task shows that movement intermittency increases in distal direction along the arm during multi-joint movements. This result suggests that a neuromuscular noise option is favored against a submovement-based central planning alternative, as the source of variability in slow movements. An additional experimental study with eight healthy subjects who completed slow elbow flexion movements at a constant slow speed target under varying <b>resistive</b> <b>torque</b> levels demonstrates that resistive torques can significantly decrease movement speed variability. The relationship between <b>resistive</b> <b>torque</b> levels and speed variability, however, is not monotonic. This finding may constitute a basis for proper design of novel human skill augmentation methods for delicate tasks and improve motor rehabilitation and learning protocols. Finally, a neuro-musculoskeletal model of the elbow suggests that movement speed variability in slow movements cannot be solely attributed to variability in the mechanics of muscle force generation. Together, these analyses, simulations, and experiments shed light on variability in slow movements, and will inform the development of novel paradigms for robotic rehabilitation, motor skill learning and augmentation...|$|E
