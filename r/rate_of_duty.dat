50|$|CARICOM itself {{superseded}} the Caribbean Free Trade Association, {{which established}} {{a free trade}} agreement at the time among all of the current CARICOM members except Haiti, Suriname and The Bahamas. With Suriname and Haiti's accessions to CARICOM in 1995 and 2002 respectively all CARICOM members, except The Bahamas, currently engage in free trade with each other {{under the terms of the}} old Common Market Annex to the Treaty of Chaguaramas or under the terms of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas that establishes the CARICOM Single Market. The EPA negotiated with the EU contains a regional preference clause (Article 238 of the Agreement) which strengthens Caribbean integration and ensures that trade liberalization commitments granted to the EU and its member states by any CARIFORUM state is also extended to by that state to all other CARIFORUM states. As a result, CARIFORUM countries are required to give the same or more favourable treatment concerning trade in goods and services to each other as they give to the EU and its member states and that this treatment shall apply immediately for products that have a zero <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty.</b> The Regional Preference Clause also requires that the More Developed Countries of CARICOM (The Bahamas, Barbados, Jamaica, Guyana, Suriname and Trinidad & Tobago), together with the Dominican Republic should apply such treatment one year after the signature of the Agreement in relation to all other products and services specified in the Agreement. The Less Developed Countries of CARICOM (Antigua & Barbuda, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, St Lucia, St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines) are not required to extend such treatment to the Dominican Republic and vice versa until two years after the signature of the Agreement, while Haiti is not required to extend such favourable treatment to the Dominican Republic before five years after the Agreement has been signed.|$|E

40|$|Customs {{classification}} is {{an important}} element in a country's trade policy. How a good is classified can affect the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> that applies, the coverage of non-tariff barriers, and the formulation and application of rules of origin. Reclassifications can occur because of the introduction of a new product, but also because of protectionist motives. This paper is the first attempt at explaining these reclassifications. Focusing on the European Union, I examine whether the number of tariff lines in an industry result from the introduction of new products or from protectionist lobbying. The analysis focuses on 90 manufacturing industries over 12 years. Results suggest that protectionist lobbying does play a role in explaining changes in the EU's customs classification.

40|$|Relating the {{collected}} customs {{duty to the}} value of imports enables to estimate a rate of applied duty that takes into account all the pricing components and their utilisation. Indeed, this ad-valorem equivalent integrates the complex dimensions of customs duties, the measures of exemption and suspension, and those concerning preferential regimes. Processing collected duties for all the products reveals that the 1. 5 % <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> actually applied in 2003 is the same for the EU and the US. Nevertheless, it appears that the US taxes more the LDCs and the developing countries than the EU. Thus, setting aside those products which enter free of duty, the rate of taxation applied by the US is 15 % and 6. 2 % respectively with regards to LDCs and developing countries, whereas in the EU's case it is only 3. 7 % and 4. 1 %. For the US market the sectors that are the most highly taxed upon importation are those of textiles, apparel and clothing, cotton and articles of leather, whereas for the EU it is more agricultural and food products (fruits and preserves, meats, sugars and cereals). trade protection, custom duties, trading regimes, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E
