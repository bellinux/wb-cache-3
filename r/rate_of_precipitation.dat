25|$|The {{carbonate}} compensation depth (CCD) is {{the point}} in the ocean where the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> of calcium carbonate is balanced by the rate of dissolution due to the conditions present. Deep in the ocean, the temperature drops and pressure increases. Calcium carbonate is unusual in that its solubility increases with decreasing temperature. Increasing pressure also increases the solubility of calcium carbonate. The carbonate compensation depth can range from 4–6km below sea level.|$|E
25|$|From 70 to 50 {{million years}} ago the Laramide orogeny, a major {{mountain}} building event in western North America, created the Rocky Mountains to the east. The uplift possibly acted on a buried fault to form the area's Waterpocket Fold. More recent uplift of the entire Colorado Plateau and the resulting erosion has exposed this fold at the surface only within the last 15 to 20 million years. Ice ages in the Pleistocene increased the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> and erosion.

25|$|Sublimation is {{when water}} {{molecules}} directly leave {{the surface of}} ice without first becoming liquid water. Sublimation accounts for the slow mid-winter disappearance of ice and snow at temperatures too low to cause melting. Antarctica shows this effect to a unique degree because it {{is by far the}} continent with the lowest <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> on Earth. As a result, there are large areas where millennial layers of snow have sublimed, leaving behind whatever non-volatile materials they had contained. This is extremely valuable to certain scientific disciplines, a dramatic example being the collection of meteorites that are left exposed in unparalleled numbers and excellent states of preservation.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} found that {{bevirimat}} does not inhibit the cytochrome P450 system or interact with the human P-glycoprotein. Unformulated bevirimat is not well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the blood. Some of the less desirable properties of unformulated bevirimat and its salts include: inadequate bioavailability, poor solubility of the pharmaceutical composition in gastric fluid, insufficient dispersion of bevirimat in gastric fluid, below standard long term safety profile for oral dosage forms, below standard long term chemical and physical stability of the final dosage form, tendency for conversion to metastable forms, lengthy dissolution times for oral dosage forms, and precipitation in gastric or intestinal fluids. Some pharmaceutical compositions of formulated bevirimat have shown to have better properties over unformulated bevirimat. Some of these properties include: improved bioavailability, improved solubility of the composition in gastric fluid, improved dispersion of bevirimat in gastric fluid, improved safety for oral dosage forms, improved chemical and physical stability of the oral dosage form, decreased conversion to metastable forms, and decreased <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> in gastric fluid. Bevirimat was rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with detectable concentrations present in the plasma within 15 minutes after administration and peak plasma concentrations were achieved approximately one to three hours after administration. The plasma had a mean plasma elimination half-life ranging from 58 to 80 hours. This long half-life of bevirimat supports once-daily dosing. Elimination of bevirimat is primarily via hepatobiliary routes, with renal elimination counting for less than 1% of the dose.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} citrate and phosphocitrate ions on the {{spontaneous}} <b>precipitation</b> <b>of</b> magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate (MgNH 4 PO 4 · 6 H 2 O, struvite) at pH 8. 50 and 25 °C was investigated at conditions of constant solution supersaturation. The supersaturated solutions were prepared in synthetic wastewater. The presence of citrate and phosphocitrate {{in the working}} solutions showed reduction <b>of</b> the initial <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> struvite <b>precipitation</b> when compared with solutions in their absence. The parabolic dependence <b>of</b> the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> on the relative solution supersaturation suggested a surface-diffusion-controlled mechanism. Presence of citrate and phosphocitrate in the supersaturated solutions at concentration levels from 1 to 10 µM resulted in a drastic increase in induction times. The presence of citrate and phosphocitrate inhibited struvite precipitation up to 75 – 80 %. The reduction <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>rates</b> was related to additive concentration following an expression suggested by the kinetic Langmuir-type adsorption model. The affinity constant calculated for citrate (8. 2 × 105) was considerably higher than the respective value for phosphocitrate (0. 6 × 105). Finally, {{it should be noted}} that the morphology of the prismatic, elongated struvite crystals precipitated in the presence of citrate and in the presence of phosphocitrate showed differences only in size...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{previous}} climate model simulations of a split {{of the polar}} jet stream during the late Pleistocene, we hypothesize that (1) 20 - 13. 5 ka BP, season-toseason variation in the latitudinal maximum of the jet stream core led to enhanced wetness in the Great Basin, and (2) after 13. 5 ka BP, northward movement of the jet stream resulted in increased aridity similar to today. We suggest that the enhanced effective wetness was due to increased precipitation combined with an energylimited reduction in evaporation rates that was caused by increased summer cloud cover. A physically based thermal evaporation model was used to simulate evaporation for Lake Lahontan under various hypothesized paleoclimates. The simulated evaporation rates, together with hypothetical <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> and discharge, were input to a water balance model of Lake Lahontan. A 42 % reduction in evaporation rate, combined with maximum historical <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> (1. 8 times the mean annual rate) and discharge (2. 4 times the mean annual rate), were sufficient to maintain Lake Lahontan at its 20 - 15 ka BP level.
