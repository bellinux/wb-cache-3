5|$|<b>Revolutions</b> <b>per</b> <b>Minute</b> is {{the second}} studio album by American rock band Rise Against. It was {{released}} on April 8, 2003, by Fat Wreck Chords. After establishing a fanbase with their 2001 debut The Unraveling, Rise Against wanted to record an album that distinguished themselves from other Fat Wreck Chords bands of the time. They chose Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore to produce the album, with whom they developed a strong rapport. Recording took place from November to December 2002 at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado.|$|E
5|$|Musically, <b>Revolutions</b> <b>per</b> <b>Minute</b> {{is rooted}} in {{hardcore}} punk and melodic hardcore. Critics noted that the album exhibited greater musical maturity and an overall darker tone when compared to its predecessor. It comprises thirteen songs, with lyrical themes ranging from relationships and politics. To promote the album, Rise Against toured extensively with other Fat Wreck Chords bands, and participated in the 2003 Warped Tour. Upon its release, the album reach number thirty-five on the Independent Albums chart, and was praised for its impassioned lyrics and unique blend of hardcore punk and melodic hardcore. Some critics called {{it one of the}} best albums of the year.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Werber was {{attempting}} to leverage the Trio's popularity as a club act into a recording contract. Both Dot Records and Liberty Records expressed some interest, but each proposed to record the Trio on 45 rpm (<b>revolutions</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute)</b> singles only, whereas Werber and the Trio members both felt that 33⅓ rpm albums had more potential for the group's music. Through Jimmy Saphier, agent for Bob Hope who had seen and liked the group at The Purple Onion, Werber contacted Capitol Records, which dispatched prominent producer Voyle Gilmore to San Francisco to evaluate the Trio's commercial potential. On Gilmore's strong recommendation, Capitol signed the Kingston Trio to an exclusive seven-year deal.|$|E
5|$|In June 1970, Vikrant was docked at the Naval Dockyard, Bombay, due to many {{internal}} fatigue {{cracks and}} fissures {{in the water}} drums of her boilers {{that could not be}} repaired by welding. As replacement drums were not available locally, four new ones were ordered from Britain, and Naval Headquarters issued orders not to use the boilers until further notice. On 26 February 1971 the ship was moved from Ballard Pier Extension to the anchorage, without replacement drums. The main objective behind this move was to light up the boilers at reduced pressure, and work up the main and flight deck machinery that had been idle for almost seven months. On 1 March, the boilers were ignited, and basin trials up to 40 <b>revolutions</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (RPM) were conducted. Catapult trials were conducted on the same day.|$|E
5|$|The American {{rock band}} Rise Against has {{recorded}} 130 songs, which include 117 original songs and 13 covers. The band {{was formed in}} 1999, and signed a recording contract with the independent record label Fat Wreck Chords the following year. Under this label, they released The Unraveling (2001) and <b>Revolutions</b> <b>per</b> <b>Minute</b> (2003), which helped to establish an early fanbase. Afterwards, the band signed with Geffen Records, and made their major record label debut with Siren Song of the Counter Culture (2004), which was followed by The Sufferer & the Witness (2006). Both albums charted on the Billboard 200, with the latter peaking at number ten. Rise Against's popularity continued to grow when they switched labels once again to DGC and Interscope Records. Their next three albums—Appeal to Reason (2008), Endgame (2011), and The Black Market (2014)—charted highly worldwide. Rise Against's eighth album, Wolves, was released in 2017.|$|E

Their major label debut Siren Song of the Counter Culture (2004) brought the band mainstream success, producing several successful singles. Their next two albums, The Sufferer & the Witness (2006) and Appeal to Reason (2008), were also successful and peaked at number ten and number three on the Billboard 200 chart, respectively. Appeal to Reason was followed three years later by Endgame (2011). All four albums released via Geffen were certified platinum in Canada, while three of these albums were certified gold in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Massa {{was slow}} to {{accelerate}} leaving the turn six hairpin on lap 49, giving Alonso the opening he needed to take the lead. Smedley was later heard apologising to Massa over the radio. De La Rosa made his one and only pit stop of the event for super-soft compound tyres on lap 51. Di Grassi, at turn one on the same lap, hit a kerb damaging his car's rear suspension, which meant {{it was not possible}} for him to continue competing in the race. He was pushed into his garage by his team to retire. Vettel placed pressure on Massa by setting consecutive fastest laps to reduce the time gap between them. Petrov was on course to score one point but was told by his team to shift early into seventh gear on lap 58 otherwise his maximum <b>revolutions</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> would be changed to a lower setting. De La Rosa attempted to lap Kovalainen around the inside of the second corner on the 60th lap but the two cars made contact. De La Rosa sustained damage to a section of his front wing while Kovalainen drove to his garage and got out of his car to become the race's fifth (and final) retirement on lap 61.|$|E
5|$|The C5 {{is powered}} by a 12-volt {{lead-acid}} electric battery driving a motor with a continuous rating of 250 watts and a maximum speed of 4,100 <b>revolutions</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> It is coupled with a two-stage gear-drive that increases torque by a factor of 13, without which the motor {{would not be able to}} move the vehicle when a person is on board. However, the motor is vulnerable to overheating. The torque increases as the load on the vehicle increases, for instance by going up too steep a gradient. Sinclair's tests showed that it could cope under power with a maximum slope of 1 in 12 (8%) and could manage a 1 in 7 (14%) slope using the pedals. As the speed of the motor reduces, the current flow through its windings increases, drawing up to 140 amps at stall speed. This would very quickly burn the motor out if sustained, so the motor's load is constantly monitored by the C5's electronics. If it stalls under full load the electronics disable the motor after 4 seconds, while if it is under heavy load (around 80 or 90 amps) it trips after two or three minutes. A heat-sensitive resistor inside the motor warns the driver if the vehicle is beginning to overheat and disconnects the motor after a short time, and a third line of defence is provided by a metallic strip mounted on the motor. If an excessive temperature is reached the strip distorts and the power is disconnected.|$|E

5000|$|In horology, a {{tourbillon}} ( [...] ; [...] "whirlwind") is {{an addition}} to the mechanics of a watch escapement. Developed around 1795 and patented by the French-Swiss watchmaker Abraham-Louis Breguet on June 26, 1801, a tourbillon aims to counter the effects of gravity by mounting the escapement and balance wheel in a rotating cage, to negate the effect of gravity when the timepiece (thus the escapement) is stuck in a certain position. By continuously rotating the entire balance wheel/escapement assembly at a slow rate (typically about one <b>revolution</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute),</b> the tourbillon averages out positional errors.|$|R
