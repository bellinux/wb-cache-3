40|$|This report {{examines}} a rollout and turnoff (ROTO) {{system for}} reducing the runway occupancy time for transport aircraft in low-visibility weather. Simulator runs were made to evaluate the system that includes a head-up display (HUD) to show the pilot a graphical overlay of the runway along with guidance and steering information to a chosen exit. Fourteen pilots (airline, corporate jet, and research pilots) collectively flew a total of 560 rollout and turnoff runs using all eight runways at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport. The runs consisted of 280 runs for each of two <b>runway</b> <b>visual</b> <b>ranges</b> (RVRs) (300 and 1200 ft). For each <b>visual</b> <b>range,</b> half the runs were conducted with the HUD information and half without. For the runs conducted with the HUD information, the runway occupancy times were lower and more consistent. The effect was more pronounced as visibility decreased. For the 1200 -ft visibility, the runway occupancy times were 13 % lower with HUD information (46. 1 versus 52. 8 sec). Similarly, for the 300 -ft visibility, the times were 28 % lower (45. 4 versus 63. 0 sec). Also, for the runs with HUD information, 78 % (RVR 1200) and 75 % (RVR 300) had runway occupancy times less than 50 sec, versus 41 and 20 %, respectively, without HUD information...|$|R

40|$|Atmospheric aerosol acts to both {{reduce the}} {{background}} concentration of natural cluster ions, and to attenuate optical propagation. Hence, {{the presence of}} aerosol has two consequences, {{the reduction of the}} air’s electrical conductivity and the <b>visual</b> <b>range.</b> Ion-aerosol theory and Koschmieder’s visibility theory are combined here to derive the related non-linear variation of the atmospheric electric potential gradient with <b>visual</b> <b>range.</b> A substantial sensitivity is found under poor <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> conditions, but, for good <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> conditions the sensitivity diminishes and little influence of local aerosol on the fair weather potential gradient occurs.

40|$|Abstract: This {{assessment}} method {{is based on}} {{years of experience in}} overhead crane visual inspection and analysis. The main concern of the technique is to identify and fix the lateral and diagonal displacement of cranes originating from miscellaneous causes. The {{assessment method}} describes the steps to follow when a displacement problem is observed on an overhead crane. The analysis includes <b>runways</b> <b>visual</b> inspection, visual inspection of the <b>runways</b> substructures, <b>visual</b> analysis with cameras, monitoring of the runways substructure and runways displacement with indicators and acquisition system. The method is working by elimination to converge toward the cause of the abnormal displacement. It includes a few techniques of telemetry and traditional precision measurements. The method is in accordance with the ASME 1, 2 and CSA 3 standards and with the practices of the industry. On site anecdotes and experiences are presented in conjunction with the applicable standards to provide quick tips to point out a massive amount of interrelated problems...|$|R
40|$|AbstractVisual {{range from}} road {{alignments}} {{plays an important}} role in traffic safety since it is a key factor for drivers to adopt an appropriate speed. It is especially true to low-grade highways where speeds tend to reach a high value when sections have a relatively good linearity. High speeds on low-grade highway are considered a main contributor to traffic accidents. This paper studied the relationship of maximum <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> and driving speed on low-grade highways to put forward a suggested <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> for safe driving. Four typically mountainous highway models with the same driving environment but different <b>visual</b> <b>ranges</b> were constructed to analyze the effect of <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> on driving speed. A driving simulator with eight degrees of freedom was used to carry out the experiments. Data of driving speed, acceleration and deceleration were collected to study the speed and acceleration trends. The conclusion drawn is that the appropriate value of maximum <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> on low-grade highways is recommended to be 80 m to ensure safety driving...|$|R

BUA (Channel Islands) Douglas C-47B-20-DK (registration: G-ANTB) was operating a scheduled international passenger flight from Paris Orly to Jersey. Despite the deteriorating weather conditions at Jersey's States Airport, the crew decided to continue its approach to runway 27. This approach was abandoned because <b>runway</b> <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> fell below minima. When the aircraft made a second approach, it struck the outermost pole of the approach light system at a height of , [...] short of the runway threshold. This caused the aircraft to crash into the approach lights and catch fire, which killed 26 of the 27 occupants (three out of four crew members and all 23 passengers).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT]Aerosol has {{a crucial}} role in earth {{radiation}} budget on a global scale as well as in a source of air pollution on a regional scale. We investigated atmospheric <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> with aerosol particle size and extinction coefficient using in-situ observation and ground-based remote sensing data to estimate the atmospheric turbidity. In this study, we analyzed the data observed at two SKYNET sites, Fukue-jima (32. 6 °N, 128. 8 °E) and Amami-oshima (28. 2 °N, 129. 2 °E) islands from 2003 to 2004. Both islands are considered as the best sites to observe the aerosol all through the year because they are located at downwind region where we can observe the Asian aerosol with little influence of local pollution. We have several kinds of in-situ observations and remote sensors at both islands, such as Optical Particle Counter (OPC), LIDAR, skyradiometer, and so on. We estimated the extinction coefficient from OPC and LIDAR measurement data to compare it with atmospheric <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> data obtained by eye observation. We made detailed match-up data analyses based on the report of the atmospheric <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> by Japan Meteorological Agency. We obtained the following results: 1) there is a consistent relationship between OPC and LIDAR measurements, related to the atmospheric visual range; 2) a coefficient in the theoretical relationship between extinction coefficient and atmospheric <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> are consistent to the previous studies; 3) the coefficient is more than double when the atmospheric <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> is less than 10 km. These results suggest that aerosol ground-based measurements with atmospheric <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> observation could provide an index of atmospheric turbidity statistically...|$|R
