Beyoncé, however, <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> eyes at the thin excuses, and assures Kelly that she and Michelle love her and she does not need not to suffer alone. At this, Kelly begins to cry and laugh at the same time. Michelle goes on to tell her of the day she confronted her boyfriend {{when she saw him}} browsing through jewelry with another woman. During the last minute of the video, Kelly can seen be seen looking cold and angry as her boyfriend comes home. He arrives apologetic, but she perks up, dangling a pair of fuzzy handcuffs. He smiles and begins to follow her upstairs. In the following scene, he is naked except for a pair of boxers (in some versions, his rear-end is blurred out) and handcuffed to the balcony. With her bags packed and the handcuff key in hand, she leaves—laughing happily leaving her partner shocked and angry. The girls are finally seen walking down the city street, holding hands, as an image of the album cover of Destiny Fulfilled passes by on a city bus.|$|E
500|$|Back in 1939, as the British sailors {{fight the}} Nazis in the ballroom, Mulder tells [...] "Scully" [...] {{that she has}} to turn the ship around and return to the Bermuda Triangle {{in order to get the}} ship out of the rift in space. Mulder grabs [...] "Scully" [...] and kisses her, [...] "in case they never meet again". [...] "Scully" [...] punches him, and he jumps overboard. Mulder wakes up in 1998 in a hospital, {{surrounded}} by Scully, the Lone Gunmen and Skinner. Mulder attempts to tell them that he traveled to 1939, and of his encounter with Nazis, and tells Scully that she was there with him, but they all think he is delirious. After Skinner and the Gunmen leave, Mulder calls Scully back and tells her that he loves her. Scully thinks his confession is an effect of the drugs he has been given, <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> eyes and leaves. As he lies down, Mulder winces as his cheek touches the pillow; the spot where [...] "Scully" [...] punched him in 1939 is still sore and visibly bruised. Mulder feels his eye-socket and breaks into a knowing smile, as the screen fades to black.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "Male Model" [...] targets {{the male}} {{role models for}} female rock bands, while [...] "Pompeii" [...] explores soul-searching themes such as one's losses and anxieties. [...] "Youth Decay" [...] was {{described}} by PopMatters as a song that [...] "grapples with adult disbelief {{of the problems of}} youth and the manifestations of it in terms of eating disorders and silence." [...] It features fast punk rock guitar work. The lyrics to [...] "#1 Must-Have" [...] reference images of the riot grrrl scene in the mainstream media. It was written when Tucker was preparing for an interview about the subject, held by the EMP Museum in Olympia, Washington. The song also alludes to the misogyny that took place at the Woodstock music festival in 1999, where several women were raped. Similarly, the song [...] "Was It a Lie?" [...] is a protest against how violence is used as entertainment in the media. [...] "The Professional" [...] aims at music journalism and contains heavy drum work, while [...] "Ironclad" [...] features [...] "fuzzed-out riffs and pounding fills". Other songs such as [...] "Leave You Behind" [...] and [...] "The Swimmer" [...] feature soft melodies and harmonies. [...] "You're No Rock n' Roll Fun" [...] was described as [...] "easy moving, beach punk rock music". [...] "Milkshake n' Honey" [...] was considered to be the band's funkiest song. Pitchfork commented that the song [...] "spits wit at expatriates in Paris as Corin <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> eyes at the type of denizens in The Sun Also Rises." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rowling made a guest {{appearance}} as {{herself on the}} American animated sitcom The Simpsons, in a special British-themed episode entitled [...] "The Regina Monologues". The dialogue consisted of a short conversation between Rowling and Lisa Simpson, who mispronounces Rowling's name. She acknowlewdges Lisa with [...] "Thank you, young Muggle". When Lisa asks her about the ending of Harry Potter, Rowling sighs and says: [...] "He grows up, and marries you. Is {{that what you want}} to hear?" [...] to which Lisa swoons and dreamily replies, [...] "Yes!" [...] before Rowling <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> eyes and walks away.|$|E
2500|$|There is meta-humor in this strip; for example, the {{characters}} talk with their mouths closed. Their dialogue has many exclamation points {{when they talk}} quietly or nicely like the dialogue in Peanuts. Also, in some strips, there are repeated drawings and lines (i.e. in the May 21, 2008 strip, Buckles steps back from a harmless garter snake, horrified. He then hides behind Paul, who rolls his eyes and says, [...] "For crying out loud, Buckles! It's just a harmless garter snake!" [...] After that, like Buckles, Paul steps back from the harmless garter snake, horrified. Then he hides behind Jill, who is gardening but <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> eyes, saying, [...] "For crying out loud, Paul!..." [...] like Paul did with Buckles).|$|E

The Scarrowmania had plunged along, bows under, against fresh northwesterly gales most of the way across the Atlantic, and there is very little comfort on board a small, deeply-loaded steamer when she <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> rails in, and lurches with thudding screw swung clear over big, steep-sided combers. Moreover, Agatha had scarcely slept during the few days and nights that she had spent in the train.

60|$|During {{the winter}} {{she and her}} mother had managed to do most of the work themselves, hiring little Mary Robinson next door on {{especially}} busy days, and now and then calling in the assistance of Jimmy Bowen and his hand sled to carry orders to customers. But when spring came Lilian prepared to open up her summer campaign on a much larger scale. Mary Robinson was hired for the season, and John Perkins was engaged to act as carrier with his express wagon. A summer kitchen was boarded in in the backyard, and a new range bought; Lilian began operations with a striking advertisement in the Willington News and an attractive circular sent around to all her patrons. Picnics and summer weddings were frequent. In bread and <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> trade was brisk and constant. She also took orders for pickles, preserves, and jellies, and this became such a flourishing branch that a second assistant had to be hired.|$|E

6000|$|When men see girls wasting {{their time}} in {{consultations}} about bonnets and ball dresses, and in giggling or sentimental love-confidences, or middle-aged women mismanaging their children, and solacing themselves with acrid gossip, they can hardly help saying, “For Heaven’s sake, let girls be better educated; let them have some better objects of thought—some more solid occupations.” But after a few hours’ conversation with an oracular literary woman, or a few hours’ reading of her books, they are likely enough to say, “After all, when a woman gets some knowledge, see what use she makes of it! Her knowledge remains acquisition instead of passing into culture; instead of being subdued into modesty and simplicity by a larger acquaintance with thought and fact, she has a feverish consciousness of her attainments; she keeps a sort of mental pocket-mirror, and is continually looking in it at her own ‘intellectuality;’ she spoils the taste of one’s muffin by questions of metaphysics; ‘puts down’ men at a dinner-table with her superior information; and seizes the opportunity of a soirée to catechise us on the vital question {{of the relation between}} mind and matter. And then, look at her writings! She mistakes vagueness for depth, bombast for eloquence, and affectation for originality; she struts on one page, <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> eyes on another, grimaces in a third, and is hysterical in a fourth. She may have read many writings of great men, and a few writings of great women; but she is as unable to discern the difference between her own style and theirs as a Yorkshireman is to discern the difference between his own English and a Londoner’s: rhodomontade is the native accent of her intellect. No—the average nature of women is too shallow and feeble a soil to bear much tillage; it is only fit for the very lightest crops.” ...|$|E
