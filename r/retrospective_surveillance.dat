40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the feasibility of early-warning systems for epidemic malaria informed by climate variability. Whereas modelling approaches typically assume stationary conditions, epidemiological systems are characterized by changes in intervention measures over time, at scales typically longer than inter-epidemic periods. These trends in control efforts preclude simple application of early-warning systems validated by <b>retrospective</b> <b>surveillance</b> data; their effects are also difficult to distinguish from those of climate variability itself. Methods Rainfall-driven transmission models for falciparum and vivax malaria are fitted to long-term <b>retrospective</b> <b>surveillance</b> data from four districts in northwest India. Maximum-likelihood estimates (MLEs) of model parameters are obtained for each district via a recently introduced iterated filtering method for partially observed Markov processes. The resulting MLE model is then used to generate simulated yearly forecasts in two different ways, and these forecasts are compared with more recent (out-of-fit) data. In the first approach, initial conditions for generating the predictions are repeatedly updated on a yearly basis, based on the new epidemiological data and the inference method that naturally lends itself to this purpose, given its time-sequential application. In the second approach, the transmission parameters themselves are also updated by refitting the model over a moving window of time. Results Application of these two approaches to examine the predictability of epidemic malaria in the different districts reveals differences in the effectiveness of intervention for the two parasites, and illustrates how the ‘failure’ of predictions can be informative to evaluate and quantify the effect of control efforts {{in the context of}} climate variability. The first approach performs adequately, and sometimes even better than the second one, when the climate remains the major driver of malaria dynamics, as found for Plasmodium vivax for which an effective clinical intervention is lacking. The second approach offers more skillful forecasts when the dynamics shift over time, as is the case of Plasmodium falciparum in recent years with declining incidence under improved control. Conclusions Predictive systems for infectious diseases such as malaria, based on process-based models and climate variables, can be informative and applicable under non-stationary conditions...|$|E

Methods: <b>Retrospective</b> <b>surveillance</b> of LASIK surgery cases where besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0. 6 % or moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0. 5 % were prescribed as prophylactic medications. Surgeons from nine US surgical centers provided retrospective case information on surgical outcomes from consecutive cases and reported any adverse events related to the antibacterial used. The primary endpoint was the incidence of adverse drug reactions. Results: A total of 801 case reports (801 eyes; 534 besifloxacin, 267 moxifloxacin) were obtained. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age at time of surgery was 36. 1 (10. 6) years. The mean (SD) duration of antibiotic treatment was 8. 6 (2. 2) days in the besifloxacin group and 8. 0 (2. 3) in the moxifloxacin group; daily dosing frequency was higher in the moxifloxacin group preoperatively, {{on the day of}} surgery, and postoperatively. There were no reports of adverse drug reactions for the 801 eyes in this surveillance. There were no differences between the besifloxacin and moxifloxacin treatment groups in rates of unexpected corneal findings (2. 1 % vs 1. 5 %, P = 0. 949).

40|$|A peptide-based {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay (ELISA) can be {{used for}} retrospective serosurveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by helping identify undetected chains of disease transmission. The assay was developed by epitope mapping, using synthetic peptides from the spike, membrane, and nucleocapsid protein sequences of SARS-associated coronavirus. The new peptide ELISA consistently detected seroconversion by week 2 of onset of fever, and seropositivity remained through day 100. Specificity was 100 % on normal blood donor samples, on serum samples associated with infection by other pathogens, and on an interference panel. The peptide-based test has advantages of safety, standardization, and automation over previous immunoassays for SARS.

40|$|We {{confirmed}} {{infection of}} 2 patients with Borrelia mi-yamotoi in Japan by <b>retrospective</b> <b>surveillance</b> of Lyme disease patients and detection of B. miyamotoi DNA in se-rum samples. One patient also showed seroconversion for antibody against recombinant glycerophosphodiester phos-phodiesterase of B. miyamotoi. Indigenous relapsing fever {{should be considered}} a health concern in Japan. Borrelia miyamotoi, which is genetically grouped with relapsing fever borreliae, was recently identified as a human pathogen in Russia (1), the United States (2 – 4), and Europe (5). Ticks of the Ixodes persulcatus species com-plex are transmission vectors. Pathogenic borreliae were discovered in I. persulcatus ticks in Japan (6). In areas of Japan to which Lyme disease is endemic, wild rodents {{have been found to be}} infected with B. miya-motoi (7), although no human infections have been con-firmed. B. miyamotoi isolates from Japan are potential hu-man pathogens because they form a monophyletic lineage with isolates from patients in Russia (1). We conducted a retrospective investigation to identify occult cases of hu-man infections with B. miyamotoi in Japan. The Study A total of 615 serum samples were obtained from 408 persons in Japan who had confirmed Lyme disease or un-confirmed, clinically suspected Lyme disease and used to detect B. miyamotoi DNA. The serum archive was estab-lished during 2008 – 2013 at the National Institute of Infec-tious Diseases (Tokyo, Japan). Use of human samples wa...|$|E
40|$|Factors {{related to}} the {{development}} of extrapulmonary forms of tuberculosis (EPTB) are still poorly understood, particularly in high-endemic countries like Brazil. The objective of the paper is to determine host and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strain-related factors associated with the development of EPTB in Espírito Santo state, Brazil. We conducted a <b>retrospective</b> laboratory-based <b>surveillance</b> study of new tuberculosis (TB) cases diagnosed in Espírito Santo state, Brazil between 1998 and 2007. We genotyped 612 isolates of MTB from 606 TB patients using spoligotyping and IS 6110 -restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing and compared sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients with pulmonary TB (PTB) and EPTB. Among 606 patients, 464 (77 %) had PTB, 79 (13 %) had EPTB, 51 (8 %) had both, and 12 (2 %) had miliary TB. The IS 6110 RFLP analysis demonstrated that 250 (41 %) isolates belonged to clustered RFLP patterns, 27 (11 %) of which were from EPTB. We identified 73 clusters including 35 (48 %) composed of 2 isolates each. By spoligotyping, 506 (83 %) MTB isolates fell into known patterns and 106 (17 %) fell into patterns with no family assignment; 297 (48 %) isolates belonged to the Latin-American Mediterranean family. Higher school level (4 - 7 years OR: 0. 16 95 % CI 0. 34 - 0. 73 and > 8 years of education, OR 0. 06 95 % CI 0. 009 - 0. 50) white ethnicity (OR: 2. 54 95 % CI 1. 03 - 6. 25) and HIV infection (OR: 16. 83 95 % CI 5. 23 - 54. 18) were associated with EPTB. No specific strain lineage or percentage of clustering was associated with EPTB. These results demonstrate that risk factors for EPTB are related more to host than to MTB strain lineage characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: As most trauma {{patients}} require long-term {{hospital stay}} and long-term antibiotic therapy, {{the risk of}} fungal infections in such patients is steadily increasing. Early diagnosis and rapid treatment is life saving in such critically ill trauma patients. Aims: To see the distribution of various species of Candida among trauma patients and compare the accuracy, rapid identification and cost effectiveness between VITEK 2, CHROMagar and conventional methods. Settings and design: <b>Retrospective</b> laboratory-based <b>surveillance</b> study performed {{over a period of}} 52 months (January 2009 to April 2013) at a level I trauma centre in New Delhi, India. Materials and Methods: All microbiological samples positive for Candida were processed for microbial identification using standard methods. Identification of Candida was done using chromogenic medium and by automated VITEK 2 Compact system and later confirmed using the conventional method. Time to identification in both was noted and accuracy compared with conventional method. Statistical analysis: Performed using the SPSS software for Windows (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, version 15. 0). P values calculated using χ 2 test for categorical variables. A P < 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: Out of 445 yeasts isolates, Candida tropicalis (217, 49 %) was the species that was maximally isolated. VITEK 2 was able to correctly identify 354 (79. 5 %) isolates but could not identify 48 (10. 7 %) isolates and wrongly identified or showed low discrimination in 43 (9. 6 %) isolates but CHROM agar correctly identified 381 (85. 6 %) isolates with 64 (14. 4 %) misidentification. Highest rate of misidentification was seen in C. tropicalis and C. glabrata (13, 27. 1 % each) by VITEK 2 and among C. albicans (9, 14 %) by CHROMagar. Conclusions: Though CHROMagar gives identification at a lower cost compared with VITEK 2 and are more accurate, which is useful in low resource countries, its main drawback is the long duration taken for complete identification...|$|R
40|$|<b>Retrospective</b> {{studies and}} <b>surveillance</b> on {{humans and animals}} {{revealed}} that Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) has been circulating on Mayotte for at least several years. A {{study was conducted in}} 2011 to estimate the seroprevalence of RVF in humans and in animals and to identify associated risk factors. Using a multistage cluster sampling method, 1420 individuals were enrolled in the human study, including 337 children aged 5 to 14 years. For the animal study, 198 seronegative ruminants from 33 randomly selected sentinel ruminant herds were followed up for more than one year. In both studies, information on environment and risk factors was collected through a standardized questionnaire. The overall weighted seroprevalence of RVFV antibodies in the general population aged $ 5 years was 3. 5 % (95 % CI 2. 6 – 4. 8). The overall seroprevalence of RVFV antibodies in the ruminant population was 25. 3 % (95 % CI 19. 8 – 32. 2). Age ($ 15), gender (men), place of birth on the Comoros, living in Mayotte since less than 5 years, low educational level, farming and living close to a water source were significantly associated with RVFV seropositivity in humans. Major risk factors for RFV infection in animal...|$|R
