5|$|The city {{population}} {{is composed of}} people from virtually every region of Bangladesh. The long-standing inhabitants {{of the old city}} are known as Dhakaia and have a distinctive dialect and culture. Between 15,000 and 20,000 of the <b>Rohingya,</b> Santal, Khasi, Garo, Chakma and Mandi tribal peoples reside in the city. Dhaka also has a large population of European, Chinese, Korean, Indian, Pakistani, Nepali, Burmese and Sri Lankan expatriates working in executive jobs in different industries. Dhaka is also home to over 300,000 Bihari refugees, who are descendants of migrant Muslims from eastern India during 1947 and settled down in East Pakistan. The correct {{population is}} ambiguous; although official figures estimate at least 40,000 residents, it is estimated that there are at least 300,000 Urdu-speakers in all of Bangladesh, mostly residing in refugee camps in Dhaka.|$|E
5|$|After Myanmar's {{government}} {{failed to}} respond to the devastating effects of Cyclone Nargis in 2008, officials responded more quickly to the floods and the effects from Komen. Relief supplies were airdropped to marooned villages, assisting the <b>Rohingya</b> people in Rakhine. The government allocated US$1.2million toward supplying farmers with rice paddy seeds to regrow damaged crops. About half of the damaged crop was replanted by November 2015, and in most areas, the grounds remained fertile for future growing. Local businesses donated K2.06billion toward buying supplies, and businessman Aung Ko Win donated US$3.6million. The Myanmar Red Cross, which was already responding to the ongoing flooding, provided additional supplies and assisted with evacuations. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies assisted in these efforts by providing rice and blankets. Volunteers distributed sleeping mats, mosquito nets, medical supplies, and tarps. Various United Nations agencies assisted the residents in displaced camps that were affected further by Komen. Within a month of the storm, the World Food Programme had provided meals to over 450,000people. Food and oil prices rose in the weeks after the floods, and the price of rice reached record levels in the country in August and September 2015. The cost gradually declined after the next rice harvest. To help unemployed farm workers, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation financed a program to pay storm victims to rebuild damaged embankments and restore clean water access. An assessment by the United Nations, the World Bank, and the Myanmar government found that women and children were the worst affected group during and after the disaster, due to the stresses of the damaged houses, and insufficient food and assistance in the subsequent months.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, the {{relative}} {{success of the}} Moros in the Philippines and the tragic failure of the <b>Rohingyas</b> in Myanmar raise important questions: what are the reasons behind the Moros' liberation movement being a success and the <b>Rohingyas</b> movement being a failure?

Secondly, the Moros' movement has been led by a strong organization under a capable leadership while the Rohingyas' movement lacks a strong organization and an able leadership. Finally, while the Moros have successfully mobilized mass support both at home and abroad, the <b>Rohingyas</b> have failed to internationalize their movement and, consequently, they have become "stateless" and “political refugees”...|$|R
