40|$|It is {{generally}} {{assumed that the}} sources of Fast Radio Bursts radiate roughly isotropically, so that the observed low duty cycle of any individual source indicates a similar low duty cycle of its <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>emission.</b> An alternative hypothesis is that the radiative duty cycle is O(1), but that the radiation is emitted in a beam with a solid angle comparable to the observed duty cycle, whose direction wanders or sweeps across the sky.

40|$|Aircraft {{and other}} {{vehicles}} are often kept in service beyond their original design lives. As they age, they become susceptible to system malfunctions and fatigue. Unlike future aircraft {{that will include}} health-monitoring capabilities as integral parts in their designs, older aircraft have not been so equipped. The Adaptable Vehicle Health and Usage Monitoring System {{is designed to be}} retrofitted into a preexisting fleet of military and commercial aircraft, ships, or ground vehicles to provide them with state-of-the-art health- and usage-monitoring capabilities. The monitoring system is self-contained, and the integration of it into existing systems entails limited intrusion. In essence, it has bolt-on/ bolt-off simplicity that makes it easy to install on any preexisting vehicle or structure. Because the system is completely independent of the vehicle, it can be certified for airworthiness as an independent system. The purpose served by the health-monitoring system is to reduce vehicle operating costs and to increase safety and reliability. The monitoring system is a means to identify damage to, or deterioration of, vehicle subsystems, before such damage or deterioration becomes costly and/or disastrous. Frequent monitoring of a vehicle enables identification of the embryonic stages of damage or deterioration. The knowledge thus gained can be used to correct anomalies while they are still somewhat minor. Maintenance can be performed as needed, instead of having the need for maintenance identified during cyclic inspections that take vehicles off duty even when there are no maintenance problems. Measurements and analyses acquired by the health-monitoring system also can be used to analyze mishaps. Overall, vehicles can be made more reliable and kept on duty for longer times. Figure 1 schematically depicts the system as applied to a fleet of n vehicles. The system has three operational levels.

Galactic 'microquasars', which are binary systems {{consisting of a}} neutron star or stellar-mass black hole accreting gas from a companion star, also produce relativistic jets, generally together with radio flares(2). Apart from an isolated event detected(3) in Cygnus X- 1, there has hitherto been no systematic evidence for the acceleration of particles to gigaelectronvolt or higher energies in a microquasar, with the consequence that we are as yet unsure about the mechanism of jet energization.

We start by determining the statistical distribution of the aggregate network interference. We then investigate four applications of the proposed model: 1) interference in cognitive radio net-works; 2) interference in wireless packet networks; 3) spectrum of the aggregate <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>emission</b> of wireless net-works; and 4) coexistence between ultrawideband and nar-rowband systems.

40|$|Wide-band signals play {{important}} roles in the most exciting areas of science, engineering, and medicine. To {{keep up with the}} demands of exploding internet traffic, modern data centers and communication networks are employing increasingly faster data rates. Wide-band techniques such as pulsed radar jamming and spread spectrum frequency hopping are used on the battlefield to wrestle control of the electromagnetic spectrum. Neurons communicate with each other using transient action potentials that last for only milliseconds at a time. And in the search for rare cells, biologists flow large populations of cells single file down microfluidic channels, interrogating them one-by-one, tens of thousands of times per second. Studying and enabling such high-speed phenomena pose enormous technical challenges. For one, parasitic capacitance inherent in analog electrical components limits their response time. Additionally, converting these fast analog signals to the digital domain requires enormous sampling speeds, which can lead to significant jitter and distortion. State-of-the-art imaging technologies, essential for studying biological dynamics and cells in flow, are limited in speed and sensitivity by finite charge transfer and read rates, and by the small numbers of photo-electrons accumulated in short integration times. And finally, ultra-high throughput real-time digital processing is required at the backend to analyze the streaming data. In this thesis, I discuss my work in developing real-time instruments, employing ultrafast optical techniques, which overcome some of these obstacles. In particular, I use broadband dispersive optics to slow down fast signals to speeds accessible to high-bit depth digitizers and signal processors. I also apply telecommunication multiplexing techniques to boost the speeds of confocal fluorescence microscopy. 	The photonic time stretcher (TiSER) uses dispersive Fourier transformation to slow down analog signals before digitization and processing. The act of time-stretching effectively boosts the performance of the back-end electronics and digital signal processors. The slowed down signals reach the back-end electronics with reduced bandwidth, and are therefore less affected by high-frequency roll-off and distortion. Time-stretching also increases the effective sampling rate of analog-to-digital converters and reduces aperture jitter, thereby improving resolution. Finally, the instantaneous throughputs of digital signal processors are enhanced by the stretch factor to otherwise unattainable speeds. Leveraging these unique capabilities, TiSER becomes the ideal tool for capturing high-speed signals and characterizing rare phenomena. For this thesis, I have developed techniques to improve the spectral efficiency, bandwidth, and resolution of TiSER using polarization multiplexing, all-optical modulation, and coherent dispersive Fourier transformation. To reduce the latency and improve the data handling capacity, I have also designed and implemented a real-time digital signal processing electronic backend, achieving 1. 5 tera-bit per second instantaneous processing throughput. Finally, I will present results from experiments highlighting TiSER's impact in real-world applications. 	 Confocal fluorescence microscopy is the most widely used method for unveiling the molecular composition of biological specimens. However, the weak optical emission of fluorescent probes and the tradeoff between imaging speed and sensitivity is problematic for acquiring blur-free images of fast phenomena and cells flowing at high speed. Here I introduce a new fluorescence imaging modality, which leverages techniques from wireless communication to reach record pixel and frame rates. Termed Fluorescence Imaging using <b>Radio-frequency</b> tagged <b>Emission</b> (FIRE), this new imaging modality is capable of resolving never before seen dynamics in living cells - such as action potentials in neurons and metabolic waves in astrocytes - as well as performing high-content image assays of cells and particles in high-speed flow...|$|R

40|$|The {{detection}} of partial discharges (PD) {{can help in}} early-warning detection systems to protect critical assets in power systems. The <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>emission</b> of these events can be measured with antennas even when the equipment is in service which reduces dramatically the maintenance costs and favours the implementation of condition-based monitoring systems. The drawback of these type of measurements is the difficulty of having a reference signal to study the events in a classical phase-resolved partial discharge pattern (PRPD). Therefore, in open-air substations and overhead lines where interferences from radio and TV broadcasting and mobile communications are important sources of noise and other pulsed interferences from rectifiers or inverters can be present, {{it is difficult to}} identify whether there is partial discharges activity or not. This paper proposes a robust method to separate the events captured with the antennas, identify which of them are partial discharges and localize the piece of equipment that is having problems. The separation is done with power ratio (PR) maps based on the spectral characteristics of the signal and the identification of the type of event is done localizing the source with an array of four antennas.

At the IRAM 30 m telescope, we have detected the magnetar at 88 and 144 GHz, the highest <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>emission</b> ever seen from a pulsar. At 88 GHz we detected numerous individual pulses, with typical widths ~ 2 ms and peak flux densities up to 45 Jy. Together with nearly contemporaneous observations with the Parkes, Nancay, and Green Bank telescopes, we find that in late 2006 July the spectral index of the pulsar was - 0. 5 <alpha< 0 over the range 1. 4 - 144 GHz. Nine dual-frequency Very Large Array and Australia Telescope Compact Array observations in 2006 May-September are consistent with this finding, while showing variability of alpha with time. We infer from the IRAM observations that XTE J 1810 - 197 remains highly linearly polarized at millimeter wavelengths. Also, toward this pulsar, the transition frequency between strong and weak scattering in the interstellar medium may be near 50 GHz. At Gemini, we detected the pulsar at 2. 2 um in 2006 September, at the faintest level yet observed, K_s= 21. 89 +- 0. 15. We have also analyzed four archival IR Very Large Telescope observations (two unpublished), finding that the brightness fluctuated within a factor of 2 - 3 over a span of 3 years, unlike the monotonic decay of the X-ray flux.

40|$|Since the <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>emission</b> from planets is {{expected}} to be strongly influenced by their interaction with the magnetic field and corona of the host star, the physics of this process can be effectively constrained by making sensitive measurements of the planetary radio emission. Up to now, however, numerous searches for radio emission from extrasolar planets at radio wavelengths have only yielded negative results. Here we report deep radio observations of the nearby Neptune-mass extrasolar transiting planet HAT-P- 11 b at 150 MHz, using the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT). On July 16, 2009, we detected a 3 -sigma emission whose light curve is consistent with an eclipse when the planet passed behind the star. This emission is at a position 14 arcsec from the transiting exoplanet's coordinates; thus, with a synthetized beam of FWHM~ 16 arcsec, the position uncertainty of this weak radio signal encompasses the location of HAT-P- 11. We estimate a 5 % false positive probability that the observed radio light curve mimics the planet's eclipse light curve. If the faint signature is indeed a radio eclipse event associated with the planet, then its flux would be 3. 87 mJy +/- 1. 29 mJy at 150 MHz. However, our equally sensitive repeat observations of the system on November 17, 2010 did not detect a significant signal in the radio light curve near the same position. This lack of confirmation leaves us with the possibility of either a variable planetary emission, or a chance occurrence of a false positive signal in our first observation.
