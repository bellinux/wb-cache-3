5|$|After another Chicago punt, the Colts {{advanced}} to the Bears' 36-yard line before Tillman ended the drive by forcing and recovering a fumble from tight end Bryan Fletcher. But on the next play, Grossman fumbled a snap, and Colts defensive lineman Raheem Brock <b>recovered</b> <b>the</b> ball. Manning then led the Colts to Chicago's 17-yard line. With two seconds left, Vinatieri attempted a 36-yard field goal, but his kick sailed wide left, and the score remained 16–14 at halftime.|$|E

Germanicus coordinated a land and riverine offensive, with troops marching eastward across the Rhine, and sailing from the North Sea up the Ems River in order to attack the Bructeri and Cherusci.

5|$|Beginning in March 2008, Rutgers {{attempted}} to convert Westerman to defensive tackle, {{so he could}} replace the departed Eric Foster.

With one quarter remaining in the game, Tech held a 35–24 lead.|$|E

5|$|High-stepping {{into the}} endzone, Aqib Talib {{committed}} a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, which was enforced on the post-score kickoff. The penalty, {{coupled with a}} good kick return by Virginia Tech, gave the Hokies excellent field position for their third possession of the game. Quarterback Sean Glennon capitalized on that field position, connecting on a 24-yard pass to wide receiver Justin Harper. The catch pushed Virginia Tech inside Kansas territory and seemingly set up the Hokie offense for their first score of the game. After twoplays for no gain and a five-yard loss when Glennon was sacked by James Holt, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt a 49-yard field goal. Jud Dunlevy's kick fell short, however, and Virginia Tech was denied a score. Kansas <b>recovered</b> <b>the</b> short kick, which landed in the end zone, and returned the ball 39yards. Despite the momentum earned by the missed kick, Kansas went three plays without gaining a first down {{and was forced to}} punt the ball away. Virginia Tech <b>recovered</b> <b>the</b> ball at its 15-yard line and ran two plays before time ran out in the first quarter.|$|E
