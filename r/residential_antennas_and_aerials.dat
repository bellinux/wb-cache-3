25|$|The {{last three}} topics deal with radio propagation, <b>aerials,</b> <b>and</b> {{frequency}} measurement. Covered are topic such as wavelength, frequency, nature and propagation of radio waves; ground and sky waves; skip distance; and fading. Common types of transmitting <b>and</b> receiving <b>aerials</b> such as Yagi <b>antennas,</b> <b>and</b> radiation patterns, measurement of frequency {{and use of}} simple frequency meters conclude the topic.|$|R
50|$|All {{practical}} antennas are {{at least}} somewhat directional, although usually only the direction in the plane parallel to the earth is considered, <b>and</b> practical <b>antennas</b> can easily be omnidirectional in one plane. The most common types are the Yagi antenna, the log-periodic <b>antenna,</b> <b>and</b> the corner reflector antenna, which are frequently combined and commercially sold as <b>residential</b> TV <b>antennas.</b> Cellular repeaters often make use of external directional antennas to give a far greater signal than can be obtained on a standard cell phone. Satellite Television receivers usually use parabolic <b>antennas.</b> For long <b>and</b> medium wavelength frequencies, tower arrays are used in most cases as directional antennas.|$|R
5000|$|The words antenna (plural: antennas in US English, {{although}} both [...] "antennas" [...] and [...] "antennae" [...] {{are used in}} International English) <b>and</b> <b>aerial</b> are used interchangeably. Occasionally the term [...] "aerial" [...] is used to mean a wire antenna. However, note the important international technical journal, the IEEE Transactions on <b>Antennas</b> <b>and</b> Propagation.In the United Kingdom and other areas where British English is used, the term aerial is sometimes used although 'antenna' has been universal in professional use for many years.|$|R
50|$|To send a {{television}} picture in colour across a radio link requires {{at least a}} camera, a transmitter, a receiver, a suitable <b>antenna</b> (<b>aerial)</b> <b>and</b> a monitor (TV). The camera provides the picture and the transmitter sends the picture. The transmitter must produce adequate power at microwave frequencies. The receiver must be sensitive at the frequency in use and decode the vision and sound signals. Things that {{can be added to}} these basic “blocks” are: multiple cameras, vision captions and effects. The expansion of {{a television}} system is almost boundless, a fully equipped ATV studio (and some amateurs do have these) can come later. In the UK all bands from 70 cm upwards are available for ATV. In the 23 cm band and above the standard mode of transmission for ATV is frequency modulation of the vision carrier with a 6 MHz FM audio sub-carrier. The UK ATV calling and talkback frequency is 144.75 MHz FM. Listen or put out a “CQ ATV” call to make initial contact. A licence issued by your national authority is required to operate a television transmitting station, licence conditions will vary in different counties — in the UK this is administered by OFCOM.|$|R

40|$|Array antennas {{which are}} {{integrated}} onto structures of aircraft <b>and</b> unmanned <b>aerial</b> vehicles (UAVs) {{are subject to}} unsteady aerodynamic loads. Mechanical forces and these aerodynamic loads will cause deformation of the antenna supporting structure. As a consequence, the positions and orientations {{of the elements of}} the phased array antenna change. The relative phases of the respective signals feeding the <b>antennas</b> will vary, <b>and</b> as a consequence the antenna radiation pattern is affected: the main beam direction can change and the beam width and/or side lobe levels can increase. The influence of deformations and vibrations will be most significant on array antennas, which are large in terms of wavelength (high gain antennas). The objective of the present paper is to present some applications of such array <b>antennas,</b> <b>and</b> to discuss the effects of deformations and vibrations on the performance of array <b>antennas,</b> <b>and</b> to describe technology to counteract these effects by means of adaptive or synthetic beam forming...|$|R
