2500|$|The rabbit {{mating system}} is rather complex. Dominant males exhibit polygyny, whereas lower-status {{individuals}} (males and females) often form monogamous breeding relationships. Rabbits signal {{when they are}} ready to copulate by marking inanimate objects while giving off odoriferous substances though their chin gland, a process known as [...] "chinning". Dominance hierarchies exist in parallel for both males and females. Social rank is based on the amount of group aggression. The dominant buck has greater mobility and more aggression than the dominant doe. This is likely because males have to fight each other for the females. The social hierarchy of males is also determined by a number of other factors, such as the size of his patrol area, the number of females that visit his area, <b>resting</b> <b>time</b> near females, the number of shelters he visits, and the distance he travels daily.|$|E

40|$|Circadian {{rhythms and}} rest {{homeostasis}} are independent processes, each regulating important components of rest-activity patterns.

All four cave species retained biological rhythmicity, and in three of the four there is a pronounced 24 -hour rhythm; in the fourth there is an altered rhythmicity of 38 - 40 hours.

40|$|International audienceForward {{and reverse}} stress growth {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} on polypropylene/organoclay nanocomposites containing the same clay loading but characterized by different microstructures. Stress overshoots have been observed for the initial start-up experiments and for the following reverse start-up experiments after a certain <b>rest</b> <b>time.</b> The amplitude of these overshoots increased with the applied shear rate and <b>rest</b> <b>time,</b> but the overshoots occurred at the same strain of about 1. 7. The overshoots {{are related to the}} structure of the nanocomposites, in particular the magnitude of the overshoots increased with the degree of the clay exfoliation in the matrix. Two models, initially developed for colloidal suspensions and fiber suspensions, have been used to describe the observed phenomena. The overshoots are fairly well predicted by the first (structure network) model and explained by the competing effects of the structure breakdown under flow and reorganization during <b>rest</b> <b>time.</b> However, the model predicts that the shear stress following the overshoot decreases and reaches steady-state too rapidly. The second model developed for ellipsoid suspensions describes quite well the stress overshoots for the initial forward flow, but no effect of <b>rest</b> <b>time</b> is predicted. A modified version has been proposed by adding a molecular diffusivity contribution in the Folgar-Tucker equation.

WalkerIn {{commercial}} bakeries, {{the baker}} expects {{to get the}} same bread loaf, including weight and size, after sheeting the same size dough piece. Doughs made from different flours have different elastic recoveries to a great extent, which has an effect on the dough’s size and density. Products made from differently elastic doughs can’t have the same shape and height. Weight may also be affected. The dough rheological behaviors of five flours and their blends having different chemical and physical properties were measured as were changes in thickness and snapback (thickness of the machined dough sheet relative to the roll gap) immediately following sheeting. Dough snapback was determined to be a function of both processing parameters, reduction ratio, and dough <b>rest</b> <b>time,</b> as well as different flour properties. The predication equation for dough snapback is based on multiple flour properties and sheeting conditions. Among the variables, Mixograph work, reduction ratio, and dough <b>rest</b> <b>time</b> were the main factors affecting the elastic characteristics of the doughs. Minimum snapback occurred with the weakest flour experiencing the longest <b>rest</b> <b>time</b> and the smallest reduction ratio.

40|$|Objective. A {{collective}} {{labour agreement}} concerning extended rest periods during long-distance shuttle bus trips of Dutch long-distance coach drivers {{was established in}} 1997. The main {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the extent to which top-down implementation of these health regulations, with respect to <b>rest</b> <b>times</b> and subjective health complaints in the private passenger-transport sector, succeeded in the year 2002. Methods. A questionnaire study was carried out on 440 coach drivers and 97 of their employers. The questionnaire for coach drivers focused on the frequency they received the required <b>rest</b> <b>times</b> and on their health status. The questionnaire for employers focused on the number of rest hours that their companies scheduled for long-distance shuttle bus trips for their drivers. Motives for not scheduling the required rest hours were noted as well. Results. Almost every employer (93 %) and three-quarters of the drivers (72 %) reported at least 12 h <b>rest</b> <b>time</b> before a long-distance shuttle bus trip, as required. Approximately half of the employers (57 %) reported planning the required rest during and after these bus trips. Fewer than one-quarter of the drivers (24 %) received at least 10 h rest at their destination and fewer than half of the coach drivers (42 %) always receive the required 24 h rest after the trip. In addition, the significant results are indicative of a positive relationship between the duration of the rest period during and after the long-distance shuttle bus trip and the level of health complaints of the coach drivers. Conclusions. Top-down implementation of health regulations with respect to <b>rest</b> <b>times</b> resulted in successful implementation after 5 years in approximately half of the companies. Longer <b>rest</b> <b>times</b> during the high season of 2002 were associated with less health complaints at the end of that seaso...|$|R
