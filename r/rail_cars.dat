5|$|In 1933, the Pennsylvania took {{delivery}} of two <b>rail</b> <b>cars</b> that operated in car-and-trailer configuration. Largely {{similar to the}} car ordered by the Reading, these <b>rail</b> <b>cars</b> were also beset by problems with their rubber-tired wheels, which were later replaced with conventional trucks. After being retrofitted, these cars {{went on to become}} the longest surviving of the Budd–Michelin <b>rail</b> <b>cars.</b> They remained with the Pennsylvania until 1943, when they were sold to the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad, a Virginia short line that operated them for only a few months; they were ultimately scrapped in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Metro finally ordered new <b>rail</b> <b>cars,</b> but {{the first}} of the cars were not due to be {{delivered}} until February 2001.|$|E

5|$|The Blue Line was {{originally}} planned {{to follow a}} slightly different route. The plan would have sent Blue Line trains to Huntington, with Yellow Line trains serving Franconia–Springfield. This was changed due to a shortage of <b>rail</b> <b>cars</b> {{at the time of}} the completion of the line to Huntington. Because fewer <b>rail</b> <b>cars</b> were required to operate Yellow Line service than would be required to run Blue Line service out to Huntington – due to the Yellow Line's shorter route – the line designations were switched. From 1999 to 2008, the Blue Line operated to Huntington on July 4, as part of Metro's special Independence Day service pattern.|$|E

5|$|That {{afternoon}} violence {{broke out}} in Martinsburg, West Virginia, between workers and militia guarding a train, prompting the governor of West Virginia {{to appeal to the}} President for aid. Strikers occupied stations at Cumberland, Maryland; Grafton, West Virginia; Keyser, West Virginia, and elsewhere, and halted the movement of freight. Newspaper reports counted 400–500 men who had joined the rail strike, and in Martinsburg, 75 trains with 1,200 <b>rail</b> <b>cars</b> sat idle.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} public dissatisfaction erupted July 14, 1877 in Martinsburg, West Virginia, {{and spread}} to Maryland, New York, Illinois, Missouri and Pennsylvania. Violence {{broke out in}} Pittsburgh, and between July 21 and 22, 40 were killed {{and more than a}} 1,000 <b>rail</b> <b>cars</b> and 100 engines were destroyed. Another 16 were killed in an uprising in Shamokin, Pennsylvania, and strikers set fire to much of central Philadelphia in disturbances there.|$|E
5|$|After {{building}} two demonstrators in {{what would}} become its signature semi-streamlined, fluted stainless-steel style, the Budd Company built four production rubber-tired <b>rail</b> <b>cars</b> for American railroads: one for the Reading Company, two for the Pennsylvania Railroad, and the Silver Slipper for the Texas and Pacific Railway. All were plagued by problems, chief among them their tendency to derail. By 1935, the Silver Slipper had been scrapped, and the Pennsylvania's two cars, the longest surviving of the Budd–Michelin collaborations, met the same fate in 1948.|$|E

5|$|On November 3, 2004, an {{out-of-service}} Red Line train rolled {{backward into}} the Woodley Park – Zoo / Adams Morgan station and hit an in-service train {{stopped at the}} platform. No one was killed, but 20 people were injured. A 14-month investigation concluded that the train operator was most likely not alert as the train rolled backward into the station. Safety officials estimated that had the train been full, at least 79 would have died. The train operator was dismissed and Metro officials agreed to add rollback protection to more than 300 <b>rail</b> <b>cars.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other service truncations {{also occur}} in the system during rush hour service only. On the Red Line, every other train bound for Shady Grove terminates at Grosvenor-Strathmore, in {{addition}} to the alternating terminations at Silver Spring mentioned above. For the Yellow Line, all trains bound for Fort Totten terminate at Mount Vernon Square. These are primarily instituted due to a limited supply of <b>rail</b> <b>cars</b> and the locations of pocket tracks throughout the system.|$|E
5|$|By January 24, {{the number}} {{had risen to}} more than 30,600 per day—three {{times as many as}} {{originally}} estimated. Angry commuters using the Anacostia, Navy Yard, and Waterfront stations peppered the transit agency with complaints. WMATA claimed that a number of factors contributed to the ridership crunch: the system was experiencing record ridership; two-year-old ridership projections were used; the five stations were opened two months ahead of schedule; the five new stations were opened two months before new <b>rail</b> <b>cars</b> were ready for service; and WMATA offered free parking at the Green Line stations, which drew 12,000 rather than 4,000 riders to the line.|$|E
50|$|The ACTS (from German Abroll{{container}} Transportsystem / roller {{container transport}} system) offers a loading principle from a roller container truck directly on to a <b>rail</b> <b>car.</b> There is no additional installation {{required for the}} process as the level arm of the truck can push the container on to a transport frame that is mounted on the <b>rail</b> <b>car.</b> The transport frame consists of two U-profile rail bars and a central pivot - this allows the frame to swing out for loading and to swing back to be parallel with the <b>rail</b> <b>car</b> for distance travel by rail.|$|R

5|$|During the Blizzard of 1996, on January 6, a Metro {{operator}} {{was killed}} when a train failed {{to stop at the}} Shady Grove station. The four-car train overran the station platform and struck an unoccupied train that was awaiting assignment. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation found that the crash was a result of a failure in the train's computer-controlled braking system. The NTSB recommended that Metro grant train operators the ability to manually control the braking system, even in inclement weather, and recommended that Metro prohibit parked <b>rail</b> <b>cars</b> on tracks used by incoming outbound trains.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} WMATA's {{internal}} route designations, the Blue Line service travels along {{the entirety of}} the J Route (from the terminus at Franconia-Springfield to the C & J junction just south of King Street), part of the C Route (from the C & J junction just south of King Street to Metro Center), part of the D Route (from Metro Center to the D & G Junction just east of Stadium-Armory) and the entire G Route (from the D & G junction past Stadium-Armory to the terminus at Largo Town Center). The Blue Line needs 23 six-car trains (138 <b>rail</b> <b>cars)</b> to run at peak capacity.|$|E
5|$|On November 3, 2004, an {{out-of-service}} Red Line train rolled backwards {{into the}} Woodley Park station, hitting an in-service train {{stopped at the}} platform.

A 14-month investigation concluded that the train operator was most likely not alert as the train rolled backwards into the station. Safety officials estimated that had the train been full, at least 79 people would have died.
