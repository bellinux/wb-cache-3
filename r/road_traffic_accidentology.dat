40|$|Data {{from the}} Chinese police service suggest {{substantial}} reductions in <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> injuries since 2002, but critics {{have questioned the}} accuracy of those data, especially considering conflicting data reported by the health department. To address the gap between police and health department data and to determine which may be more accurate, we conducted a simulation study based on the modified Smeed equation, which delineates a non-linear relation between <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> mortality {{and the level of}} motorization in a country or region. Our goal was to simulate trends in <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> mortality in China and compare performances in <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> safety management between China and 13 other countries. Chinese police data indicate a peak in <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> mortalities in 2002 and a significant and a gradual decrease in population-based <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> mortality since 2002. Health department data show the <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> mortality peaked in 2012. In addition, police data suggest China's <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> mortality peaked at a much lower motorization level (0. 061 motor vehicles per person) in 2002, followed by a reduction in mortality to a level comparable to that of developed countries. Simulation results based on health department data suggest high <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> mortality, with a mortality peak in 2012 at a moderate motorization level (0. 174 motor vehicles per person). Comparisons to the other 13 countries suggest the health data from China may be more valid than the police data.

The pivotal data necessary for the study was collected from the daily <b>Road</b> <b>Traffic</b> Accident records format of the city.
