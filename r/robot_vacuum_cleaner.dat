40|$|The {{development}} of software-intensive systems {{is driven by}} their requirements. Traditional requirements engineering (RE) methods focus on resolving ambiguities in requirements and advocate specifying require-ments in sufficient detail so that the implementation can be checked against them for conformance. In an ideal world, {{this way of thinking}} can be very effective. Requirements can be specified clearly, updated as necessary, and evolutions of the software design can be made with the requirements in mind. Increasingly, however, it is not sufficient to fix requirements statically because they will change at runtime as the operating environment changes.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel mobile sink area allocation scheme for consumer based mobile robotic devices with a proven application to robotic vacuum cleaners. In the home or office environment, rooms are physically separated by walls and an automated robotic cleaner cannot {{make a decision}} about which room to move to and perform the cleaning task. Likewise, state of the art cleaning robots do not move to other rooms without direct human interference. In a smart home monitoring system, sensor nodes may be deployed to monitor each separate room. In this work, a quad tree based data gathering scheme is proposed whereby the mobile sink physically moves through every room and logically links all separated sub-networks together. The proposed scheme sequentially collects data from the monitoring environment and transmits the information back to a base station. According to the sensor nodes information, the base station can command a cleaning robot to move to a specific location in the home environment. The quad tree based data gathering scheme minimizes the data gathering tour length and time through the efficient allocation of data gathering areas. A calculated shortest path data gathering tour can efficiently be allocated to the robotic cleaner to complete the cleaning task within a minimum time period. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively allocate and control the cleaning area to the <b>robot</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> without any direct interference from the consumer.

Honda's Asimo humanoid robot, iRobot's Roomba <b>robot</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> and Google's driverless cars have fired the imagination of the general public, and social media buzz with speculation about a utopian world of helpful robot assistants or the coming robot apocalypse! However, there is {{a long way to go}} before autonomous systems reach the level of capabilities required for even the simplest of tasks involving human-robot interaction - especially if it involves communicative behaviour such as speech and language. Of course the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made great strides in these areas, and has moved on from abstract high-level rule-based paradigms to embodied architectures whose operations are grounded in real physical environments. What is still missing, however, is an overarching theory of intelligent communicative behaviour that informs system-level design decisions in order to provide a more coherent approach to system integration. This chapter introduces the beginnings of such a framework inspired by the principles of Perceptual Control Theory (PCT). In particular, it is observed that PCT has hitherto tended to view perceptual processes as a relatively straightforward series of transformations from sensation to perception, and has overlooked the potential of powerful generative model-based solutions that have emerged in practical fields such as visual or auditory scene analysis. Starting from first principles, a sequence of arguments is presented which not only shows how these ideas might be integrated into PCT, but which also extend PCT towards a remarkably symmetric architecture for a needs-driven communicative agent. It is concluded that, if behaviour is the control of perception, then perception is the simulation of behaviour. Comment: To appear in A. McElhone & W.

These systems rely on communication, computation and control infrastructures commonly consisting of several levels {{for the three}} worlds with various resources as sensors, actuators, computational resources, services, humans, etc. Efficient interaction of these resources is essential for cyber-physical-social systems operation. The paper presents multi-level self-organization approach for cyber-physical-social systems that distinguishes three main level for the system resource interaction: physical level, planning level, and strategic level. Smart home cleaning scenariois proposedas an example of multi-level self-organization approach. <b>Robot</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> creates room map using the light-sensitive sensors and clean room using the map.

It interacts with the vacuum cleaner for synchronization of moving light furniture.

40|$|In recent years, robotic {{technology}} has improved significantly, aided by cutting-edge scientific research studies and innovative industrial designs. It {{has taken a}} progressive leap from the coordinated world of industry to the less-ordered domestic domain with great advancements in sensor technology and computational intelligence. It is beginning to prove more useful than a <b>robot</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> or a mere plaything in human-centric spaces. This has created an imminent need for robust intelligence for a robot to move optimally with high efficiency and collision-free navigation. This research provides valuable insights into all significant stages required for autonomous navigation in dynamic cluttered environments and makes several important contributions in the area. A unique and real-time method for global path planning and collision avoidance for navigation of a mobile robot in complex time varying environments is developed. An occupancy-based three dimensional (3 D) grid map and model-based obstacle prediction are employed to represent the dynamic environment. Path planning and obstacle avoidance are performed by applying a cost-evaluation function on time-space Distance Transforms to uniquely produce the optimal path {{at the time of}} planning. Dealing with uncertainty with regard to the position of obstacles for a given navigation task is accommodated by introducing the notion of probabilities to the algorithm. The spatio-temporal cost evaluation based path planning algorithm provides the key contribution of this research. A robust method of pose estimation and tracking for a mobile robot is also investigated. The technique utilises an overhead panoramic vision camera in an indoor cluttered environment with the robot workspace of a two-dimensional planar surface. It is fast and does not require any unwarping of the panoramic view. A unique system, combining mean-shift, Kalman Filter and Hough Transform-based tracking, is used to improve the result. Experiments are conducted confirming that the system is capable of reliably localising and tracking the robot in cluttered scenes with variations of illumination and periods of occlusion. The thesis commences by describing the design of a real-time open-source 3 D simulation platform based on a game engine. The platform is primarily aimed towards research in mobile robotics, in-game character manipulation, visual surveillance-related research and high quality synthetic video generation. It provided the initial test-bed for this research to analyse ideas and algorithms including path planning, prior to the physical realisation experiments. Finally, a complete navigation system is integrated for a wheel-based mobile robot verifying the innovations in a real-world scenario. The system will be incorporated into a larger project that is aimed towards the enhancement of robotic assistive technologies for elderly and disabled people...|$|E

This chapter also includes insight into software and explanes three different methods of inputting RAPID code. The machine vision system and its implementation in software are described in {{the last part of the}} chapter. Fourth chapter describes the two demonstration programs that were the motivation for our work. The challange of the first program was to make a paper airplane with YUMI. The second program included localisation and manipulation of tubes. The tubes were located using mechanical vision, while the manipulation was performed by the robot. The tubes were piched up and caps were unscrewed from the tubes. Description advocates positive and negative features of the robot and places for improvement...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{this article}} we present a novel mapping system that robustly generates highly {{accurate}} 3 D maps using an RGB-D camera. Our approach does not require any further sensors or odometry. With the availability of low-cost and light-weight RGB-D sensors such as the Microsoft Kinect, our approach applies to small domestic <b>robots</b> such as <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> as well as flying robots such as quadrocopters. Furthermore, our system {{can also be used}} for free-hand reconstruction of detailed 3 D models. In addition to the system itself, we present a thorough experimental evaluation on a publicly available benchmark dataset. We analyze and discuss the influence of several parameters such as the choice of the feature descriptor, the number of visual features, and validation methods. The results of the experiments demonstrate that our system can robustly deal with challenging scenarios such as fast cameras motions and feature-poor environments while being fast enough for online operation. Our system is fully available as open-source and has already been widely adopted by the robotics community...|$|R
