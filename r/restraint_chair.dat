500|$|Studies on freely moving {{rats and}} mice have shown many hippocampal neurons to act as place cells that cluster in place fields, and these fire bursts of action {{potentials}} when the animal passes through a particular location. This place-related neural activity in the hippocampus has also been reported in monkeys that were moved around a room whilst in a <b>restraint</b> <b>chair.</b> [...] However, the place cells may have fired in relation to where the monkey was looking rather that to its actual location in the room. Over many years, many studies {{have been carried out}} on place-responses in rodents, that have given a large amount of information. Place cell responses are shown by pyramidal cells in the hippocampus and by granule cells in the dentate gyrus. Other cells in smaller proportion are inhibitory interneurons and these often show place-related variations in their firing rate which are much weaker. [...] There is little if any spatial topography in the representation; in general, cells lying next {{to each other in the}} hippocampus have uncorrelated spatial firing patterns. Place cells are typically almost silent when a rat is moving around outside the place field but reach sustained rates as high as 40 Hz, when the rat is near the center. Neural activity sampled from 30 to 40 randomly chosen place cells carries enough information to allow a rat's location to be reconstructed with high confidence. The size of place fields varies in a gradient along the length of the hippocampus, with cells at the dorsal end showing the smallest fields, cells near the center showing larger fields, and cells at the ventral tip showing fields that cover the entire environment. In some cases, the firing rate of hippocampal cells depends not only on place but also on the direction a rat is moving, the destination toward which it is traveling, or other task-related variables.|$|E

40|$|Executive Summary The use of {{full-body}} restraint devices is {{a widespread}} practice in Iowa’s county jails. Full-body restraints {{come in the form}} of <b>restraint</b> <b>chairs,</b> boards, and beds, including two such devices manufactured in Iowa. Iowa law, which refers to these as four- and fivepoint restraints, states they are only to be used when an inmate is a threat to self, others, or jail security. However, the Ombudsman found they were also used on inmates who caused minor disruptions or in response to an inmate’s verbal abuse. In some cases, the restraints were used on inmates with known mental illness who were acting out, though no attempts were made to seek medical or mental health reviews for those inmates while restrained, leading to extended use of the restraint device...|$|R

40|$|Feeding {{patterns}} {{have been}} studied in 10 adult male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) adapted to primate <b>restraint</b> <b>chairs</b> for physiological studies. Using an automated computer-monitored liquid diet feeding system, feeding behavior was studied under 8 hour and 24 hour feeding schedules. Calorie/kg intake was significantly reduced with the 8 hour schedule (pp> 0. 10). Meal size was negatively correlated with meal frequency across monkeys, but not within monkeys. Although monkeys ingested 78 % of their voluntary intake during the light hours, {{there was no difference}} in meal size, meal duration, or rate of feeding between light and dark periods. With feeding restricted to 8 hours during the light period, meal size was positively correlated with the length of the interval preceding the meal in 4 of 6 monkeys, and meal size was also positively correlated with length of the postmeal interval in 3 of 6 monkeys. In contrast, 24 hour ad lib fed monkeys showed no relationship between premeal interval and subsequent meal size, but a positive correlation between meal size and postmeal interval in 3 of 4 monkeys. We conclude that feeding schedule or deprivation state may alter the relative roles of "hunger" and "satiety" signals in regulating food intake amounts and patterns...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of control}} {{interventions}} (CI) such as mechanical/physical <b>restraints</b> (MP), <b>chairs</b> that prevent rising (Chair), and acute control medications (ACM) {{with mental health}} (MH) patients is not without controversy. Clinicians report using CIs with patients to gain immediate control of a situation of harm or imminent risk of harm involving the patient and/or others and not unexpectedly, there are unintended physical, psychological, emotional injuries and in the most serious of unintended consequences, death. Despite these substantial negative consequences, there is a dearth {{of research on the}} use of CIs in MH hospital services. The goals of the current study were three-fold: to establish the prevalence of CI use and to profile the sociodemographic, MH service use, and MH clinical characteristics of adult MH inpatients with CI use; to better understand the potential risk factors for the use of MP, Chair, ACM, and an inclusive category of “any control intervention”; and thirdly to examine the use of CIs with adult MH inpatients {{in the absence of a}} psychiatric emergency situation (NoPES). Methods: The study sample included adult inpatient mental health patients with an admission Resident Assessment Instrument- Mental Health assessment between 2006 and 2010 in Ontario. A descriptive analysis was conducted and multivariate logistic regression was used to investigate potential risk factors for the use of control interventions and the same investigation was conducted for a subsample comprised of patients presenting in hospital without a psychiatric emergency situation. Control interventions included mechanical/physical <b>restraints,</b> <b>chairs</b> that prevent rising and acute control medications. Findings: In Ontario, 21. 0 % of MH adult inpatients had at least one kind of CI use in the study sample (N = 115, 384). The most frequently used CI type was ACM (18. 6 %) followed by MP (6. 5 %), and Chair (0. 9 %). The risk models for each CI type was more informative than for an all-inclusive category of Any-CI. Aggressive behaviour, mania, positive signs and symptoms, risk of harm to others and severity of self-harm increased the risks for CI use. Non-voluntary admission increased the risk of use for all CI types. Unexpectedly greater deficits in performing of activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, cognitive performance, self-care, and having a history of falls increased the risk of CI use. A focus on these latter risk factors will be important in the development of CI reduction strategies. Sociodemographic and history of health service use variables were also considered in the model including older age which was uniquely a risk for Chair use whereas younger age was a risk for MP and ACM showing a bias or preference for Chair use with older patients. Gender was a significant risk factor for MP, ACM use, and only for Chair use with NoPES. Seventy four percent (or 85, 514) of the sample did not present in the three days prior to assessment with a psychiatric emergency situation (NoPES) such as extreme behaviours that may put the patient or others at risk of harm. Of these NoPES patients 12, 097 (14 %) experienced CI use regardless. The identification of NoPES patients is an immediate opportunity for reducing the use of control interventions in MH. The risk models developed in the current research can inform the development of CI reduction strategies; deficits in functional performance increased the risk of CI use as did a history of falls, and attenuated aggressive behaviour, mania, positive signs and symptoms and risk of harm to others. If CI use could be eliminated for the NoPES patients, Ontario could reduce its CI use to less than 10 % achieving a major step to providing higher quality patient care for patients and increasing staff satisfaction with the care. Conclusion: This study made use of the new interRAI Control Intervention clinical assessment protocol (CAP) which is embedded in the RAI-MH tool to identify the NoPES patients. This innovation in the RAI-MH is readily available to all hospitals currently using the hospital-based MH assessment instruments. Ontario is in a unique position to immediately use this capability to advance a quality improvement initiative to reduce the use of CIs in MH. The data is readily available enabling public reporting and benchmarking on CI use rates as a patient safety indicator as well as providing hospital-level reports. Additionally, more study is needed nationally and internationally to increase our knowledge of why CIs are used in MH and consequently create effective staff education/training strategies to reduce their use. In conclusion, the use of CIs in adult MH inpatient services in Ontario requires the attention of policy makers and hospital administrators. If CI use in adult MH inpatient services was identified as a priority patient safety concern by government (as it has done for hand hygiene, hospital mortality, and medication safety), Ontario could use readily available data on CI use to immediately measure prevalence, establish performance targets, and report on the progress of improving the quality and safety of care of adult MH inpatients. 1 yea...|$|R

40|$|We {{have used}} a novel {{technique}} that quantifies minerals and electrolytes from smears of sublingual cells by x-ray microanalysis to monitor metabolic changes in bed rest subjects. Increases in intracellular calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) were characteristic of subjects whose exercise regimen was inadequate to maintain calcium metabolism. To test the effects of space flight on intracellular ions, we analyzed cells from 2 - 4 kg Rhesus monkeys before and after 2 weeks in space or <b>chair</b> <b>restraint</b> (CR). There were increases in sublingual cell Ca, P and K after space flight which paralleled the clinical estimates of metabolic status of the animals and exceeded the levels found during CR on R+ 11. Increases after 2 weeks CR were 26 % in Ca, 6 % in P and 29 % in K. Species similarity ill responses of intracellular ions to inactivity imposed by bed rest, restraint or microgravity suggest that this innovative non-invasive technique would be a useful in-flight monitor of exercise countermeasures directed toward maintaining calcium balance...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} the effects of the relative inactivity and unloading on the strength of the tibias of monkeys, Macaca mulatta, we used a non-invasive test to measure bending stiffness, or EI (Nm 2), a mechanical property. The technique was validated by comparisons of in vivo measurements with standard measures of EI in the same bones post-mortem (r 2 = 0. 95, P < 0. 0001). Inter-test precision was 4. 28 +/- 1. 4 %. Normative data in 24 monkeys, 3. 0 +/- 0. 7 years and 3. 6 +/- 0. 6 kg, revealed EI to be 16 % higher in the right than left tibia (4. 4 +/- 1. 6 vs. 3. 7 +/- 1. 6 Nm 2, P < 0. 05). Five monkeys, restrained in chairs for 14 days, showed decreases in EI. There were no changes in EI in two chaired monkeys that lost weight during a 2 -week space flight. The factors that account for both the decreases in bone mechanical properties after <b>chair</b> <b>restraint</b> at 1 g and lack of change after microgravity remain to be identified. Metabolic factors associated with body weight changes are suggested by our results...|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{data has}} been {{collected}} on the response of hindlimb muscles to unloading due to both spaceflight and hindlimb suspension. One generalized response {{to a reduction in}} load is muscle fiber atrophy, although not all muscles respond the same. Our understanding of how muscles respond to microgravity, however, has come primarily from the examination of hindlimb muscles in the unrestrained rate in space. The non-human primate spaceflight paradigm differs considerably from the rodent paradigm in that the monkeys are restrained, usually in a sitting position, while in space. Recently, we examined the effects of microgravity on muscles of the Rhesus monkey by taking biopsies of selected hindlimb muscles prior to and following spaceflights of 14 and 12 day durations (Cosmos 2044 and 2229). Our results revealed that the monkey's response to microgravity differs from that of the rat. The apparent differences in the atrophic response of the hindlimb muscles of the monkey and rat to spaceflight may be attributed to the following: (1) a species difference; (2) a difference {{in the manner in which}} the animals were maintained during the flight (i. e., <b>chair</b> <b>restraint</b> or 'free-floating'); and/or (3) an ability of the monkeys to counteract the effects of spaceflight with resistive exercise...|$|R
