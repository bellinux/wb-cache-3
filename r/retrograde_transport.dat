The holotoxin can be taken up by clathrin-coated pits, {{as well as by}} clathrin-independent pathways including caveolae and macropinocytosis. Intracellular vesicles shuttle ricin to endosomes that are delivered to the Golgi apparatus. The active acidification of endosomes is thought to have little effect on the functional properties of ricin. Because ricin is stable over a wide pH range, degradation in endosomes or lysosomes offers little or no protection against ricin.

2500|$|Dynein is {{a family}} of cytoskeletal motor {{proteins}} that move along microtubules in cells. They convert the chemical energy stored in ATP to mechanical work. Dynein transports various cellular cargos, provides forces and displacements important in mitosis, and drives the beat of eukaryotic cilia and flagella. All of these functions rely on dynein's ability to move towards the minus-end of the microtubules, known as <b>retrograde</b> <b>transport,</b> thus, they are called [...] "minus-end directed motors". In contrast, kinesin motor proteins move toward the microtubules' plus end.|$|E
2500|$|MAPs {{have been}} shown to {{play a crucial role in}} the {{regulation}} of microtubule dynamics in-vivo. The rates of microtubule polymerization, depolymerization, and catastrophe vary depending on which microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) are present. The originally identified MAPs from brain tissue can be classified into two groups based on their molecular weight. This first class comprises MAPs with a molecular weight below 55-62 kDa, and are called τ (tau) proteins. In-vitro, tau proteins {{have been shown}} to directly bind microtubules, promote nucleation and prevent disassembly, and to induce the formation of parallel arrays. [...] Additionally, tau proteins have also been shown to stabilize microtubules in axons and have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease. [...] The second class is composed of MAPs with a molecular weight of 200-1000 kDa, of which there are four known types: MAP-1, MAP-2, MAP-3 and MAP-4. MAP-1 proteins consists of a set of three different proteins: A, B and C. The C protein plays an important role in the <b>retrograde</b> <b>transport</b> of vesicles and is also known as cytoplasmic dynein. [...] MAP-2 proteins are located in the dendrites and in the body of neurons, where they bind with other cytoskeletal filaments. [...] The MAP-4 proteins are found in the majority of cells and stabilize microtubules. [...] In addition to MAPs that have a stabilizing effect on microtubule structure, other MAPs can have a destabilizing effect either by cleaving or by inducing depolymerization of microtubules. [...] Three proteins called katanin, spastin, and fidgetin have been observed to regulate the number and length of microtubules via their destabilizing activities. Furthermore, KIAA1211L is predicted to be localized to the microtubules.|$|E

40|$|Neurotrophins are {{released}} from target tissues following neural innervation and bind to specific receptors {{situated on the}} nerve terminal plasma membrane. The neurotrophin-receptor complex undergoes <b>retrograde</b> axonal <b>transport</b> towards the cell soma, where it signals to the nucleus. This process allows neurotrophins to perform their numerous functions, which include the promotion of neuronal survival and the outgrowth of axons towards certain target tissues. The molecular events controlling each {{of the components of}} <b>retrograde</b> axonal <b>transport</b> are beginning to become defined. There is good evidence for the participation of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase, phosphatidylinositol 4 -kinase and the actin cytoskeleton in neurotrophin <b>retrograde</b> axonal <b>transport</b> in vivo. It also appears that the retrograde motor protein dynein mediates the <b>retrograde</b> axonal <b>transport</b> in vivo of neurotrophins such as nerve growth factor. This review discusses the role of the neurotrophin receptors in binding and axonal transport, the endocytic processes required for neurotrophin internalization, the targeting and trafficking of neurotrophins, and the propagation of neurotrophin-induced signals along the axon.

Knockdown of iPLA 1 γ expression by RNAi did not affect the anterograde transport of VSVGts 045 but dramatically delayed two types of Golgi-to-ER retrograde membrane transport; that is, transfer of the Golgi membrane into the ER in the presence of brefeldin A and delivery of cholera toxin B subunit from the Golgi complex to the ER.
