He was called [...] "Pimple" [...] {{because of his}} complexion. He became an {{accomplice}} of Saruman during the War of the <b>Ring.</b> <b>Trading</b> pipe-weed with Saruman for money, he began buying land in the Southfarthing, where Men from Isengard were stationed. With the aid of these ruffians, Lotho was able to depose and imprison Will Whitfoot, the Shire's lawful mayor, and declared himself Chief Shirriff. Under his command the Shire was industrialised, and Lotho became The Boss. However, Lotho was soon stripped of his power, and Saruman took over. Saruman's servant Gríma Wormtongue killed Lotho, and either buried Lotho or ate him, as hinted by Saruman after his defeat in the Shire.|$|E

40|$|It is fashionable {{nowadays}} {{to imagine}} {{the world on the}} move, with not only people, but also cultures, objects, capital, businesses, services, diseases, media, images, information, and ideas circulating across (and even beyond) the planet. If mobility is the new mantra to be chanted, the chorus line might be older than some of its proponents want to acknowledge. The founding fathers of anthropology had a keen interest in movement (e. g. Boas’ work on Inuit migration and Malinowski’s studies of the Kula <b>ring</b> <b>trade)</b> and critically engaged anthropologists {{were among the first to}} point out that not all contemporary mobilities are valued equally positively and that the very processes that produce global geographical as well as social mobility also result in immobility and exclusion. Drawing on extensive ethnographic fieldwork in Tanzania, I illustrate how border-crossing mobilities are imagined and discursively given meaning as a virtue or vice in the context of transnational tourism and beyond. The empirical data allow for a theoretical reflection on various uses of mobility as a concept-metaphor and on the genealogy of ideas of human mobility in anthropology, a discipline which has accused itself in the recent past of misrepresenting people as territorially, socially, and culturally bounded. I focus particularly on the added value of anthropology and its ethnographic methods in the burgeoning interdisciplinary field of mobility studies and end by assessing the analytical purchase of (im) mobility as a conceptual framework or paradigm. status: publishe...|$|R
