Although both teams had fifteen first downs, and despite Nebraska not lagging far behind with 325 overall yards compared to Missouri's 390, the game was not as close as some statistics might imply.

40|$|Central of Celebes is a seismic {{active region}} caused {{close to the}} triple {{junction}} between the Eurasian, Indo-Australian, and Pacific/Philippine plates. This region has high seismicity which dominated by shallow earthquake. This condition can be a trigger to generate an earthquake with tsunami potentially. The {{purpose of this study}} are to make model of Toli-Toli and Peleng tsunami source, its tsunami propagation and identify its <b>run</b> <b>up</b> at some <b>point.</b> In this study, we use two study cases. There are the 1996 Toli-Toli tsunami which located in Celebes Sea caused by activity of Palu Koro active fault which intersect with convergent boundaries of two tectonic plates, Philiphina Plate and Eurasian Plate and the 2000 Peleng tsunami which occur because of Batui Thrust which activated by Sorong Fault in East Celebes. This study use earthquake source parameter from Global Centroid Moment Tensor (CMT) catalog. We use single fault model to describe the source. While to get tsunami propagation and <b>run</b> <b>up</b> we use bathymetry data from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to see tsunami propagation and its <b>run</b> <b>up</b> at some <b>point</b> which may be get maximum height. All of data were treated by using tsunami simulation program from Mamoru Nakamura with finite difference method. The simulation <b>run</b> <b>up</b> of Toli-Toli tsunami get the highest in South Dampal with height about 4 m, while for Peleng tsunami simulation, Bangkalan Island get the highest with height about 2. 67 m. The simulation result from <b>run</b> <b>up</b> Toli-Toli tsunami indicate similarity with visual estimate but for simulation of Peleng tsunami, there are different with visual estimate result. It is caused by the morphology of the Peleng island which going constriction relatively, so energy can be amplified, easily therefore visual estimate can be different with our simulation...|$|R

In addition, former Cornhusker head coach Fielding H. Yost was at the helm of the Michigan team. This was the first time Nebraska had faced one of its own former head coaches.Any hopes held by the Cornhuskers to settle its affairs against Michigan were silenced, as both teams fought to a draw in the first half only for Michigan to break through and <b>run</b> <b>up</b> 31 unanswered <b>points</b> against the Cornhuskers in the second half.|$|R

With the leaky defence beginning to seal its holes, Goran turned his focus to finding an improved attacking threat. He successfully tempted former England U19 and Coventry City striker Frank Nouble to join the ranks, somewhat of a coup for a Chinese League One side.

Wisconsin Senior WR David Gilreath {{returned}} the opening kick {{of the game}} for a touchdown, RB John Clay became the first running back to go over 100 yards rushing against the Buckeyes since Joe McKnight of USC in 2008, and Wisconsin's defense harried Ohio State QB Terrelle Pryor all game long.

The Buckeyes managed to get 15 more points (via a pair of Daniel Herron touchdown runs) but the Badgers iced their incredible upset of the Buckeyes with a TD run by James White and a Philip Welch field goal. The win over Ohio State is Bret Bielema's first; he was 0-3 against the Buckeyes in the previous three meetings (2007, 2008, and 2009).

30|$|The {{thickness}} of the deposits seems {{to be related to}} the tsunami <b>run</b> <b>up</b> height in comparable transects from Phang Nga coast (Fig. 7, Table 1). The thickest deposits are in transects with the highest <b>run</b> <b>up.</b> The averaged tsunami deposit layer thickness for a coast with a tsunami <b>run</b> <b>up</b> height less than 6 m is 8.5 cm (29 measurements), and for the sites with a <b>run</b> <b>up</b> greater than 6.0 m, 11.4 cm (34 measurements). The trends of tsunami deposits thickness also differ with regard to the <b>run</b> <b>up</b> height (Figs. 3 and 4, Table 1). In the case of the smaller <b>run</b> <b>up</b> transects, the maximum thickness is usually closer to the shoreline, and then the deposits generally become thinner landward (transects 3 and 4 in Fig. 3, and transect 10 in Fig. 4). In some of the areas with the highest <b>run</b> <b>ups,</b> the deposit thickness increase inland until it reached approximately 1 / 3 of the inundation distance, where the maximum is observed, and then the deposits thin landward (transects 1, 5 and 6 in Fig. 3). The fourth transect in this group (transect 7, Fig. 4) revealed three maxima, located at approximately 100, 450 and 600 m landward, separated by areas covered by thinner deposits. The thickest deposits are found in a depression, and their deposition was probably enhanced by the local topography.|$|R
