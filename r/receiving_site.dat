At £25,000 per train and now undertaken by GB Railfreight, this practice continued periodically as funds become available. However, an increase in the landfill tax was announced in 2008, and this was due to take effect from April 2012. It would increase the cost of removal from £25/tonne to £90/tonne.

40|$|This article {{describes}} the radio frequency design and test data for an experimental terrestrial air link, which simulates a satellite-to-ground communications link operating in a dual-polarization frequency-reuse mode in the 17. 7 -to- 21. 2 -GHz band. The terrestrial air link comprises a transmit site located on Mount Pack Monadnock in Temple, New Hampshire, and a <b>receive</b> <b>site</b> 42. 2 km away in Westford, Massachusetts. The transmit site uses a 1. 8 -m-diameter dish, and the <b>receive</b> <b>site</b> uses an 18. 3 -m-diameter dish enclosed by a 28. 4 -m-diameter air-supported radome. The terrestrial air link provides a test bed for evaluating atmospheric effects of fading and scintillation, along with amplitude, phase, and polarization distortion that can compromise the performance of satellite-to-ground communications systems. The test data indicate that the terrestrial air link has {{a high degree of}} cross-polarization isolation under clear-air conditions and is well suited for evaluating dualpolarization frequency-reuse techniques.

The north-south length of the phase-sensing antennas at two of the sites is 2,400 ft, and the east-west baseline (which sets the angular-accuracy limit) is 1,200 ft or approximately 260 wavelengths.

50|$|As a {{practical}} consequence, at the <b>receiving</b> <b>site</b> the two streams are received with a residual mutual interference. In many practical cases, especially for high-level M-QAM modulations, the communication system cannot tolerate the experienced levels of cross-polarization interference and an improved suppression is necessary. The two received polarizations at the antenna outputs, normally linear horizontal H and vertical V, are routed each to a receiver whose baseband output is further processed by an ad-hoc cross-polarization cancelling scheme, commonly implemented as a digital stage. The XPIC algorithm attains the correct reconstruction of H by summing V to H to cancel any residual interference, and vice-versa.|$|E
