40|$|The {{literature}} on investors ’ holding periods for equities and bonds suggest that high transaction costs {{are associated with}} longer holding periods.

Further, work on depreciation and obsolescence might suggest that there is an optimal holding period. However, there is little empirical work in the area. In this paper, data from the Investment Property Databank are used to investigate sales rate and holding period for UK institutional real estate between 1981 and 1994.

These findings are consistent with the shape of the value function in prospect theory as first proposed by Kahneman and Tversky (1979). They also help explain the strong positive correlation between aggregate prices and volume in this and other real estate markets. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which Green Consumerism has the capacity to confer competitive advantage to the producers and distributors of certain fast moving consumer goods in the Irish retail market. It begins with {{a review of the literature}} linking mass consumerism to the major threats which currently beset the environment both on a national and global scale e. g. Ozone depletion and water pollution. The research section focuses on two major consumer markets, laundry detergents and paper tissues - both of which have been considerably influenced, during the period under review (1992 - 1996), by consumer concern about the environment. Senior management figures in the leading companies describe both the level and source of this consumer pressure and provide extensive details of the new initiatives and policies they have introduced as a consequence of it. A central part of this section is an attempt to measure the success of these so-called green marketing initiatives. One of the biggest consumer marketing campaigns ever undertaken in Ireland was conducted in this area by Lever and the objective and outcome of this is evaluated. The major food retailers in Ireland describe how, in customer panels, a very high level of concern is traditionally expressed about the negative impact of certain consumer goods on the environment. All agree, however, that there is a distinct and wide gap between this level of expressed concern of their customers and their actual buying behaviour. The ‘green brands’ which have been launched to appeal to this market segment as less damaging to the environment appear to have failed to win significant market share. Almost all have had to be withdrawn from the supermarket shelves because their <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> was considered to be unacceptably low compared with existing standard lines in their category. Nonetheless, the manufacturers and retailers involved in this study still believe this is an issue which will continue to grow in importance over the coming three years but, they expect, the impetus will no longer be coming from the marketplace but will instead come from Europe and new legislation on pollution and packaging waste...|$|E
40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScRecent {{advances}} {{in the field of}} plant genetics and application of molecular technologies has lead to greater understanding of various crop genomes and their organization. The applications of these techniques include molecular markers which have been used to examine DNA variation within crop species. This allows for the creation of further genetic variation for new and favourable traits. Molecular markers or DNA markers are short fragments of DNA {{that can be used to}} locate desirable genetic traits in the genome or show specific genetic differences. The Maloideae subfamily includes fruit species such as pear. Pears (Pyrus communis L.) are large edible fruit that are grown in cool climates, native to coastal regions in Africa, Asia and Europe. The external appearance of this fruit plays a vital role on its <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> potential. Thus it is important for the appearances of the pear to meet the expectations of the consumer. External factors affecting the appearance of fruit, such as shape and colour, can have a large influence on the consumer’s first impression and opinion of what the fruit may taste like(Jaeger and MacFie, et al., 2001). The South African pear industry is the fourth largest in the fruit industry after apple, citrus and grape, exporting 3. 8 % to Europe (Ferrandi, et al., 2005). Increase in production and export of the pear is dependant on the variety of cultivars with desired traits. New cultivars, especially ranges of new cultivars, with harvest dates from early to late in the season, can fill gaps in the marketing strategy of exporters and in the local markets (Human, et al., 2005) Therefore, development of molecular markers allows for their possible use in maker-assisted selection and for the construction of a genetic linkage map thus leading to the location of favourable traits and ultimately the improvement of the quality of the pear. In this study high throughput genomic DNA extractions were performed. The Cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) method was employed as the results proved to be most promising. Furthermore the screenings of molecular markers were conducted in order to obtain DNA variation. Molecular markers were used to locate specific genetic differences. Multiplexing PCR was conducted using fluorescent primers for further screening and results proved to be useful as many variations could be observed...|$|E

Specifically, firm size and growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> showed a significantly positive relationship with leverage, while profitability showed a significantly negative relationship with leverage. Tangible fixed assets showed a negative relationship with short-term liabilities and a positive relationship with long-term liabilities.

40|$|Decision-making is {{more complex}} and even more {{important}} for consumers today than in the past. Today’s consumers has {{a wealth of information}} sources to their disposal, through advertising, news articles, direct mailings and word of mouth, in addition, there is a variety of stores and shopping malls that has broaden the sphere for consumer choice, and in the process complicated decision - making. Consumers purchase intentions and decision that lead to the purchase are closely related to their future purchase behaviour. That is, a consumer who has used and is satisfied with a brand is likely to try it again on a future purchase occasion and is likely to follow this up with actual purchase of the brand. In this instance attitude is important to marketers not because it predicts what brands a consumers will buy, but because it can explain why they buy the brand they do. There is a need to explore and understand consumer shopping behaviour and purchase drivers within the fruit juice category. The refrigerated fruit juice category presents much confusion to the consumer and/ or shoppers, (consumer and shopper being used inter changeable) and makes it difficult to shop the category. There are many choices and lack of clarity around fruit juice types, therefore there is also a need to quantify how shoppers shop the fruit juice category. As part of a category approach to business management, consumer insights can improve merchandise positioning and promotion of the fruit juice category. The purpose and importance of the study is to gain insights into how shoppers select fruit juice(s), identify patterns of shopping behaviour. To determine how involved are shoppers in the category when selecting and purchasing their fruit juice, and to what level their commit to they selected fruit juice type. The purpose is not to produce a definitive conclusion or generalisable results, because shopper behaviour, will differ depending on store type, day of the week and day time part, but rather to form a basis to begin to understand the shoppers dynamics for the fruit juice category. Insights gained and understanding of category purchase drivers, will enable the development of an optimal category flow (shop shelf merchandising lay out) ensuring overall improvements for the category ensuring that shopper needs are met, which in turn would result in an improved shopping experience. This will also allow for an optimal marketing mix for the various brands for the different fruit juice types, that, will ensure that the brand increased its potential to be selected in-store and therefore increase its <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale.</b> The literature reviewed, illustrated the complexity of consumer behaviour, as one is dealing with human behaviour, that is not always easy to comprehend, because many factors influence behaviour. These factors vary from internal factors and external factors. One can therefore not deal with the topic on consumer behaviour and look at factors in isolation, one should attempt to have a holistic approach as the literature suggest because many variables impact on one aspect for example such as decision-making. The key lessons learnt from this study, is no different to what the literature states, the fruit juice consumer exhibited complex and various behaviour. Whilst the target groups were homogeneous, the shoppers exhibit different behaviours, hence the clusters from the (In) store TM model. However there are agreements on the following; • Loyalty in the fruit juice category is low. • There is a desire to try something new as indicative of the high prevalence of experiential shoppers. • Shoppers indicated that they decision to purchase a fruit juice is not entirely made in-store, but rather planned. • Shoppers exhibit a low level of commitment to the category. • Shoppers indicated that product related attributes do influence their purchase decision. • The fruit juice category is not well differentiated. The above findings on product involvement and commitment have managerial implications, and are important issues in {{the development and implementation of}} marketing strategies, aimed at building and maintaining market share. In-store investment should be limited to product specific promotions, and not the traditional fridge-end display and gondola ends as these promotional elements are in effective in generating sales. The challenge is to win time for the shopper in-store, is also crucial as consumers do not always have the time to shop. The product category flow should be clear and uncluttered, with product types clearly segmented in the fridge. Satisfying consumers are not enough to yield a competitive advantage, what marketers need to do is lock consumers into what their product has to offer. Marketers need to seek bonding and lasting relationships with their consumers, to ensure a competitive advantage, this they need to do by creating and evoked set, in other words, position their products in the minds of the consumer and entrench their offerings with a value added proposition intrinsic and extrinsic. The key to doing this is to ensure that their product offering(s) are tangible and visually differentiated, have an ownable proposition that will generate loyalty towards the product offering and create a high level of involvement.
