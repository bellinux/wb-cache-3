40|$|Coordination between arm-trunk and trunk-leg is {{important}} for effective longswing performance. This research describes inter-segmental coordination changes after a practice period of longswing on high bar in a novice cohort. Novices were divided by initial skill level (talent) into two groups: spontaneously-talented, (ST, n =  10, closer to expert performance) and non-spontaneously-talented (NST, n =  15). Additionally, post-practice longswing coordination was compared to expert gymnasts (n =  9). Longswing amplitude and coordination (inter-joint <b>reversal</b> <b>points</b> and continuous relative phase, CRP) were assessed for pre- and post-practice sessions. ANOVAs showed similar practice effects in swing enlargements for the ST (11 %) and NST (18 %), but inter-joint <b>reversal</b> <b>points</b> and positive area in CRP during the downswing were different. Due to practice, the ST group paired shoulder and hip <b>reversal</b> <b>points</b> (events) during the downswing closer and with larger velocity of the arm {{in relation to the}} trunk than the NST group. The NST failed to modify coordination probably due to a large variability {{at the beginning of the}} downswing. Given a similar amount of practice, talent could help to achieve the right temporal events' sequence during downswing, which would allow the exploration of different segmental coordination. However, upswing coordination of the novice groups (ST and NST) requires more focused practice to achieve expert levels than downswing, especially the arm-trunk coordination...|$|R

40|$|Continuous rhythmic {{movements}} are often geared toward particular {{points in the}} movement cycle, as evidenced by a local reduction in trajectory variability. These so-called anchor points provide a window into motor control, since changes {{in the degree of}} anchoring may reveal how informational and/or neuromuscular properties are exploited in the organization of rhythmic movements. The present experiment examined the relative contributions of informational timing (metronome beeps) and neuromuscular (wrist postures) constraints on anchoring by systematically varying both factors at movement <b>reversal</b> <b>points.</b> To this end, participants cycled their right wrist in a flexed, neutral, or extended posture, either self-paced or synchronized to a metronome pacing peak flexion, peak extension, or both peak flexion and extension. The effects of these manipulations were assessed in terms of kinematics, auditory-motor coordination, and muscle activity. The degree of anchoring seen at the <b>reversal</b> <b>points</b> depended on the degree of compatibility of the prevailing configuration of neuromuscular and informational timing constraints, which had largely independent effects. We further observed systematic changes in muscular activity, which revealed distinct contributions of posture- and muscle-dependent neuromuscular properties to motor control. These findings indicate that the anchor-based discretization of the control of continuous rhythmic wrist movements is determined by both informational timing and neuromuscular constraints in a task-specific manner with subtle interactions between the two, and exemplify how movement variability may be exploited to gain such insights. © 2012 The Author(s) ...|$|R

50|$|After {{the yield}} point, ductile metals undergo {{a period of}} strain hardening, in which the stress {{increases}} again with increasing strain, and they begin to neck, as the cross-sectional area of the specimen decreases due to plastic flow.

40|$|The {{recently}} proposed multiaxial racetrack filter (MRF) {{is able to}} {{deal with}} general non-proportional multiaxial load histories. While only requiring a single user-defined scalar filter amplitude, the MRF is able to synchronously eliminate non-damaging events from any noisy multiaxial load history without changing the overall shape of its original path, a necessary condition to avoid introducing errors in fatigue damage assessments. The MRF procedures are optimized here by the introduction of a pre-processing “partitioning” step on the load history data, which selects candidates for the <b>reversal</b> <b>points</b> in a robust partitioning process, highly increasing the filter efficiency and decreasing its computational time. The improved MRF is evaluated through the fatigue analyses of over-sampled tension-torsion data measured in 316 L stainless steel tubular specimens under non-proportional load paths...|$|R

It is observed that the ultra precision feed axis has a large overshoot of several micrometers if the velocities are increased. Further, the decay time of the ultra precision feed axis exceeds the decay time of the high speed feed axis by more than factor two.

40|$|The {{versatile}} Bouc-Wen {{model has}} been used extensively to describe hysteretic phenomena in various fields of engineering. Nevertheless, {{it is known that}} it exhibits displacement drift, force relaxation and nonclosure of hysteretic loops when subjected to short unloading-reloading paths. Consequently, it locally violates Drucker's or Ilyushin's postulate of plasticity. In this study, an effective modification of the model is proposed which eliminates these problems. A stiffening factor is introduced into the hysteretic differential equation which enables the distinction between virgin loading and reloading. Appropriate <b>reversal</b> <b>points</b> are utilized effectively to guide the entire process. It is shown that the proposed modification corrects the nonphysical behavior of the model tinder short unloading-reloading paths without affecting its response in all other cases. It is further demonstrated that the original and modified model exhibit significantly different response under seismic excitation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
