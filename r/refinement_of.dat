The design board selected the fifth design, though during <b>refinement</b> <b>of</b> the design, the secondary guns were increased in caliber from 19cm to 24cm. The 30.5cm gun was chosen because the breech of the new 28cm was unreliable. The resulting design was the last pre-dreadnought type of battleship built by the Austro-Hungarian navy.|$|E

5|$|Rhenium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Re and atomic number 75. It is a silvery-white, heavy, third-row transition metal in group 7 of the periodic table. With an estimated average concentration of 1 part per billion (ppb), rhenium {{is one of}} the rarest elements in the Earth's crust. Rhenium has the third-highest melting point and second-highest boiling point of any element at 5903K. Rhenium resembles manganese and technetium chemically and is mainly obtained as a by-product of the extraction and <b>refinement</b> <b>of</b> molybdenum and copper ores. Rhenium shows in its compounds a wide variety of oxidation states ranging from −1 to +7.|$|E
5|$|The SS190 FMJ, a <b>refinement</b> <b>of</b> the SS90, was {{introduced}} in 1993. It offered superior performance over the prototype projectile as well as slightly reduced length. The latter change allowed it to be used more conveniently in the Five-seven pistol, also being developed at that time. Fired from the P90, the SS190 propels a 2.0-g (31grain) bullet at a muzzle velocity of roughly 715m/s (2,350 ft/s). It has a steel penetrator and an aluminum core. The SS190 has been manufactured with a plain, black, and a black-on-white tip color. It is classified by the ATF as armor-piercing (AP) handgun ammunition, and its sale is currently restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers.|$|E
5|$|The first {{generation}} of drug delivery liposomes had a simple lipid composition and suffered from several limitations. Circulation in the bloodstream was extremely limited due to both renal clearing and phagocytosis. <b>Refinement</b> <b>of</b> the lipid composition to tune fluidity, surface charge density, and surface hydration resulted in vesicles that adsorb fewer proteins from serum and thus are less readily recognized by the immune system. The most significant advance in this area was the grafting of polyethylene glycol (PEG) onto the liposome surface to produce “stealth” vesicles, which circulate over long times without immune or renal clearing.|$|E

30|$|There {{are a lot}} <b>of</b> <b>refinements</b> <b>of</b> the {{discrete}} Jensen’s inequality, {{and this}} problem has been studied by many authors. It is also a natural problem to give analogous results for the classical Jensen’s inequality. In spite of this, few papers have been published dealing with this problem. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to give some <b>refinements</b> <b>of</b> the classical Jensen’s inequality. The results give a new approach of this topic. Moreover, new discrete inequalities can be derived, and the integral analogous of discrete inequalities can be obtained. We also have new <b>refinements</b> <b>of</b> the left-hand side of the Hermite-Hadamard inequality.|$|R

5|$|Venus transits are {{historically}} {{of great}} scientific importance {{as they were}} used to gain the first realistic estimates {{of the size of the}} Solar System. Observations of the 1639 transit, combined with the principle of parallax, provided an estimate of the distance between the Sun and the Earth that was more accurate than any other up to that time. The 2012 transit provided scientists with a number of other research opportunities, particularly in the <b>refinement</b> <b>of</b> techniques to be used in the search for exoplanets.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, the U.S. Army started to {{formulate}} {{requirements for the}} replacement of its helicopters then in service, {{which resulted in the}} launch of the Light Helicopter Experimental (LHX) program. Nearly a decade later, following the <b>refinement</b> <b>of</b> requirements, evaluation of submissions, and the rebranding of the programme as the Light Helicopter (LX) program, during April 1991, the Army announced the selection of the Boeing–Sikorsky team's design as the contest winner, shortly after which a contract for construction of prototypes was awarded. The Comanche was to incorporate several advanced elements, such as stealth technologies, and a number of previously untried design features. Operationally, it was to employ advanced sensors in its reconnaissance role, where it was intended to designate targets for the AH-64 Apache. It was also armed with a single Gatling gun and a limited number of missiles and rockets for light attack duties.|$|E
5|$|For a time, no overt {{action was}} taken, and the plans {{continued}} to evolve. A further <b>refinement</b> <b>of</b> {{the plan was}} developed by William and McGeorge Bundy on 29 November 1964, with a more moderate target list, which the Joint Chiefs opposed. No action was taken while these, and other, plans were considered. But matters {{came to a head}} with the attack on Camp Holloway on 7 February 1965, which demanded immediate action, and resulted in a reprisal raid known as Operation Flaming Dart. A sapper raid against an American enlisted men's billet at Qui Nhon on the 10th led to Flaming Dart II. These small-scale operations were launched against the southern region of the country, where the bulk of North Vietnam's ground forces and supply dumps were located.|$|E

5|$|Linus Pauling {{estimated}} the electronegativity of francium at 0.7 on the Pauling scale, {{the same as}} caesium; the value for caesium has since been refined to 0.79, {{but there are no}} experimental data to allow a <b>refinement</b> <b>of</b> the value for francium. Francium has a slightly higher ionization energy than caesium, 392.811(4)kJ/mol as opposed to 375.7041(2)kJ/mol for caesium, as would be expected from relativistic effects, and this would imply that caesium is the less electronegative of the two. Francium should also have a higher electron affinity than caesium and the Fr− ion should be more polarizable than the Cs− ion. The CsFr molecule is predicted to have francium at the negative end of the dipole, unlike all known heterodiatomic alkali metal molecules. Francium superoxide (FrO2) is expected to have a more covalent character than its lighter congeners; this is attributed to the 6p electrons in francium being more involved in the francium–oxygen bonding.|$|E
5|$|On March 21, 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court {{handed down}} its ruling {{in the case}} of Dunn v. Blumstein that found that a citizen who had lived in a state for 30 days was {{resident}} in that state and thus eligible to vote there. Kentucky's Constitution required residency of one year in the state, six months in the county and sixty days in the precinct to establish voting eligibility. This issue had to be resolved before the 1972 presidential election in November, so Ford called a special legislative session to enact the necessary corrections. In addition, Ford added to the General Assembly's agenda the creation of a state environmental protection agency, a <b>refinement</b> <b>of</b> congressional districts in line with the latest census figures and ratification of the recently passed Equal Rights Amendment. All of these measures passed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Refinement</b> <b>of</b> sulfidic {{zinc ores}} {{produces}} {{large volumes of}} sulfur dioxide and cadmium vapor. Smelter slag and other residues contain significant quantities of metals. About 1.1 million tonnes of metallic zinc and 130 thousand tonnes of lead were mined and smelted in the Belgian towns of La Calamine and Plombières between 1806 and 1882. The dumps of the past mining operations leach zinc and cadmium, and the sediments of the Geul River contain non-trivial amounts of metals. About two thousand years ago, emissions of zinc from mining and smelting totaled 10 thousand tonnes a year. After increasing 10-fold from 1850, zinc emissions peaked at 3.4 million tonnes {{per year in the}} 1980s and declined to 2.7 million tonnes in the 1990s, although a 2005 study of the Arctic troposphere found that the concentrations there did not reflect the decline. Anthropogenic and natural emissions occur at a ratio of 20to1.|$|E

5|$|The Boulonnais {{provided}} part of {{the base}} for the Anglo-Norman breed, which was later to play {{a large role in}} the creation of the Selle Francais. It was also used in the creation and <b>refinement</b> <b>of</b> the Italian Heavy Draft, the post-World War II improvement of the Schleswig horse, and the creation of the early 19th-century Ardennes. Some equine scholars theorize that if the smaller Mareyeur had survived, it would have been an ideal horse to cross with the Thoroughbred or Anglo-Arabian to produce a warmblood for competition. In France, a breeding program has been developed by the National Stud to cross Boulonnais and Arabian horses to create a fast, alert driving horse, called the Araboulonnais. This breeding program also brings new blood into the Boulonnais line as, if an Araboulonnais mare is bred to a Boulonnais stallion, and a resulting filly is bred to another Boulonnais stallion, the third generation horse may be inducted into the purebred Boulonnais studbook if it passes an inspection.|$|E
5|$|While local {{sources of}} gold are attested during the Aksumite era, silver {{seems to have}} been rarer in Aksum. No mention of silver mines in the region exist until the 15th and 16th centuries. Though silver was {{imported}} as attested by the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, given the preponderance of silver coins, it could not have been the only source of silver in Aksum. Furthermore, a significant number of the silver coins contain gold inlays (presumably to increase the value), which would have been unnecessary if silver were so rare {{that it had to be}} mainly imported. Silver may have been obtained from the <b>refinement</b> <b>of</b> gold, which sometimes occurs naturally with silver in an alloy called electrum.
