25|$|The Blongers' policy shop {{had plenty}} of competition, {{including}} saloon man Ed Chase and Soapy Smith, the famous Western con man. Smith was an uneasy Blonger ally for a while, but the frequent quarrels between steerers from the rival groups suggested a confrontation was brewing. In 1895 Smith went on a drunken rampage through several Larimer Street establishments including the Blongers' saloon, where police removed him; one account alleged that Lou Blonger was crouched behind the cigar counter, <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>unload</b> a shotgun. In {{the wake of the}} rampage, Smith and his brother Bascomb were charged with the attempted murder of a saloon manager. Realizing he had lost control of the situation, Soapy left for the mining boomtown of Skagway, Alaska, in 1897, ceding control of Denver's underworld to Lou Blonger.|$|E

50|$|Actually, {{building}} the Keller bodies of wood (mountain ash sourced in Alabama) solved {{a number of}} problems. Wood bodies meant that expensive tools and dies would not be needed. Cheap Alabama labor could screw and glue together all the bodies that Keller might use. In addition, of course, Hubert Mitchell already had his rather inadequate Hartselle, Alabama, woodworking plant {{that he was only}} too <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>unload</b> on the corporation. At the same time he was supporting the members of the company with personal loans, he sold his furniture factory to the corporation for nearly three times its assessed valuation, a fact brought out only later.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Terceras Landing" [...] in the Azores Islands on 25 May 1583, was a {{military}} feat as its planners {{decided to make a}} fake landing to distract the defending forces (5,000 Portuguese, English and French soldiers); also special seagoing barges were arranged in order <b>to</b> <b>unload</b> cavalry horses and 700 artillery pieces on the beach; special rowing boats were armed with small cannons to support the landing boats; special supplies were <b>readied</b> <b>to</b> be <b>unloaded</b> and support the 11,000-man landing force strength. The total strength of the amphibious force was 15,000 men, including an armada of 90 ships.|$|R
5000|$|On-set, {{cases with}} loaded {{magazines}} are often placed on standby near active cameras {{in order to}} facilitate fast magazine reloading with minimal lag time. Cases containing magazines often include an indicator of what is inside through the usage of colored stickers or magnets. The color indicates which type of film stock is inside. If the tape is normal and blank, it is a full magazine; if it is less than a full magazine, it will have the length loaded written on it. When a magazine <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be <b>unloaded</b> is placed inside, the sticker from the new magazine freshly loaded is ripped and replaced as a sticker X to indicate that the magazine is [...] "dead". If the magazine is pulled off with the intention of being put back on the camera without the take-up side first being unloaded, then the appropriate colored sticker will be placed on the case, and written with the amount of film left, followed by the word hot (to indicate that it is still in usage).|$|R

5000|$|In March 1906, the Utah Fire Proofing Company {{began work}} on the Boise River Diversion Dam with the {{provision}} that the structure would be completed within one year. It soon became apparent that the dam would not be finished on time. With little experience in such endeavors, Utah Fire Proofing failed to provide adequate foremen for the project. At least nineteen superintendents worked on the dam and their incompetence led to an extraordinary turnover in labor. Inclement weather and flooding caused at least two months' worth of delays and forced the crews to rebuild part of the structure. By April 16, 1907, the dam was only 41% complete. It would take another year and a half before the diversion works were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>unload</b> into the New York Canal. The company eventually lost $90,000 on the contract. And to make matters worse in March 1909, a log foreman [...] "maliciously" [...] removed the boom above the dam and allowed timber roll over the embankment causing $73,000 worth of damage. Yet when the structure was completed it worked famously. The Diversion Dam is 68 ft high and 500 ft in length with an overall capacity of [...]|$|E

The reduction of the current in the current sheet could be induced by a stimulation, namely by triggering. Busty bulk flows (BBFs) could trigger some substorms, although they do not have enough energy causing substorms. This subject will be discussed further in Auroral displays.|$|E
50|$|The station {{platform}} is located below the ground {{level to the}} south of the approach tracks to Warszawa Centralna, which {{can be seen from the}} platform. The station has an unusual layout and method of operation, with a single long platform alongside the southern (city-bound) track. Inbound trains stop at the west end of the platform <b>to</b> <b>unload</b> passengers, before pulling forward to the east end to allow boarding. Once trains are <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> depart, they do so via a mid-platform cross-over onto the northern track.|$|R

The [...] "Workers of Israel" [...] fund {{received}} the contract <b>to</b> <b>unload</b> the coal, but the Haifa workers refused <b>to</b> <b>unload</b> the coal. Hushi and his co-workers volunteered for the difficult work, which left them covered in soot and often led to eye infections.|$|R
25|$|After union workers went on strike, some 1,700 strikebreakers {{were brought}} in <b>to</b> <b>unload</b> ships, about 80 of whom were {{assigned}} <b>to</b> <b>unload</b> Golden Kauri. On 4 October, a strikebreaker was fatally injured by timber falling from a sling being used <b>to</b> <b>unload</b> Golden Kauri, and a second strikebreaker {{was killed in an}} industrial accident the same day. Unionists jeered at the ambulance transporting the two to hospital as it passed by.|$|R

25|$|A collier (cargo ship {{carrying}} coal) {{may hold}} 40,000 long tons of coal and takes several days <b>to</b> <b>unload.</b> Some colliers carry their own conveying equipment <b>to</b> <b>unload</b> their own bunkers; others depend on equipment at the plant. For transporting coal in calmer waters, such as rivers and lakes, flat-bottomed barges are often used. Barges are usually unpowered {{and must be}} moved by tugboats or towboats.|$|R

Also, the railway junction in Sarny was bombed, but the Armored Train Marszalek repelled the enemy. Despite this, Colonel Nikodem Sulik and General Wilhelm Orlik-Rueckemann decided <b>to</b> <b>unload</b> the equipment and take up defence positions. The Sarny Fortified Area was attacked by the Soviet 60th Rifle Division, whose advantage was crushing. The Poles defended the fortifications for three days, on September 20, facing encirclement, they had to withdraw. However, soldiers in some bunkers {{did not get the}} order to withdraw, and in some places the Poles resisted until September 25. Several bunkers were blown up by the Red Army engineers with their crews, unknown number of soldiers were murdered, including seven officers, who were shot near the Orthodox church in the village of Tynne.|$|R

6000|$|There is {{something}} calming, if not almost solemnising, in the quietude with which a boat glides ashore, {{on a dark}} night, under the overhanging trees of a wilderness lake. The oars are necessarily stopped, and the voices hushed, while the bowman, standing erect, with a long pole in hand, tries to penetrate the thick mysterious darkness {{that seems to be}} the very gate of Erebus. Bartong stood <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> thrust the head of the boat off any rocks that might suddenly appear in their course, or give the order to [...] "back all" [...] should the water become too shallow. But no obstacles presented themselves, and the boat forged slowly ahead until it lay alongside a ledge of rock or natural jetty.
