25|$|In 1898, an {{extension}} of the current Port Washington Branch from Great Neck to Port Washington was opened. With the completion of the Port Washington Branch, the LIRR reached its peak <b>route</b> <b>mileage,</b> and nothing has been added since. (This will change once East Side Access opens.) There had been previous talk of an eastern extension of the North Shore Branch to Roslyn to meet up with the Oyster Bay Branch. This would have created a more direct route to Roslyn, Glen Cove, and Locust Valley. In 1882, the first move to extend the line was made, when the officials of the LIRR toured Roslyn, Cold Spring and Oyster Bay, for a possible extension of the North Shore Branch from Great Neck to Roslyn and then through East Norwich to Syosset. Surveyors marked a route from Great Neck through Manhasset and Barrow Beach to Roslyn, and one more from Locust Valley to Northport. Because of the high cost of $400,000, this project was doomed. In December 1885, the farmers along the line of the proposed extension to Roslyn, and from Oyster Bay to Huntington were donating the right-of-way. Ten years later, in 1895, Austin Corbin was convinced by the residents of Port Washington to extend the line, but to their village. On March 30, 1896, the LIRR began staking off the line of the proposed extension between Great Neck and Port Washington. In April 1896, the Great Neck and Port Washington Railroad was incorporated to build the extension. Surveys of the right-of-way were completed in May 1896. Once Corbin died, it was unsure whether the new President of the LIRR Baldwin would finish it, but because it was such a short extension he agreed to finish it. Work progressed through March and April 1898 after some delays in the winter of 1896–1897, and July 1 was set as the completion date. In order to cross over Manhasset Bay, a viaduct was built. To this date, it is the highest bridge on the railroad, being 679 feet long, and 81 feet above the average height of water. Due to favorable spring weather, the branch opened early on June 23, 1898.|$|E

The first twenty locomotives were constructed at Brighton works and the remaining twenty at Ashford. Powerful and light, the Q1s formed the backbone of the Southern's heavy freight capability.

After the January 20 vote to demand that the subway line through Flushing be built underground, groups representing communities in south Flushing collaborated to push for an elevated along what was then the LIRR's Central Branch, in the current right-of-way of Kissena Corridor Park. Eleven days later, the PSC announced its intent to extend the line as an el from Corona to Flushing, with a possible further extension to Little Neck Bay in Bayside.

50|$|FM 400 was {{originally}} designated on June 25, 1945; its original routing was exclusively in Lubbock County, from Idalou northward to the Hale County line. On July 9 {{of that same}} year saw an extension northward, into Hale County and to a junction with FM 54 west of Petersburg. The road was lengthened, this time to the south, on December 16, 1948, from Idalou to a county road {{just north of the}} Slaton Airport. On March 19, 1949, a southern section of FM 400 was designated, replacing FM 1074. This southern section was in Lynn County, and ran southward from the Lubbock County line through Wilson to US 87. This created a gap in the routing of FM 400 in and around Slaton; this gap would be closed on May 23, 1951, when the two sections of FM 400 were both extended to connect with US 84 at two different points in Slaton. The route was extended northward to Plainview on January 27, 1950. It was extended north to the Swisher County line on December 17, 1952, replacing the section of FM 788 from US 70 north to the junction of FM 788 and FM 400. On October 29, 1953, it extended north to FM 145; this created the concurrency with FM 788, which TxDOT officially considers a gap in that <b>route's</b> <b>mileage.</b> The <b>route</b> designation was amended in 1965 after the US 84 freeway bypass south of Slaton was constructed; the old location of US 84 was renumbered Loop 251, which would eventually be redesignated as Business US 84 in 1991.|$|R
