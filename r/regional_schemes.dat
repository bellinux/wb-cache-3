40|$|Based on {{previous}} <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme</b> model studies and assumptions, we extend studies from two-level voting scheme models to multi-level voting scheme models. Due to mathematical complexity, {{we use the}} Monte Carlo approach in studying {{the stability of the}} multi-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme</b> with respect to region sizes and levels. Using this model, we are able to obtain the stability characteristics of the national voting <b>scheme,</b> the two-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme,</b> and the multi-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme,</b> and apply it in FERET human face database. According to our study, we verify again that the <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme</b> (including the two-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme</b> and multi-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme)</b> is always more stable than the national voting scheme. We find that the stability of the multi-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme</b> is not as good as the stability of the two-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme</b> when region size is within a certain range. Out of this range, the multi-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme</b> may compete with the two-level voting scheme. We conclude that the multi-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme</b> may be comparable to the two-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme</b> and prove our conclusion in the face recognition application.

40|$|Africa {{has a long}} {{tradition}} of regional cooperation, its trade and monetary integration schemes being the oldest in the developing world. This paper analyses the state of regional integration with respect to trade and financial relations in selected <b>regional</b> <b>schemes</b> in Central, Southern and West Africa. The paper concludes that in particular regional monetary integration offers advantages in terms of monetary stability, growth, competitiveness, deepening of financial markets and ownership compared with an indiscriminately integration of individual countries into the global economy. Thus, great significance must attached to cooperation between Member States. Although trade and financial integration can be mutually enforcing, a minimum level of regional activities is required to set this process in motion. Until the necessary threshold is achieved, Member States have a vital role in organizing and delivering regional activities, e. g. the development of bond markets or the promotion of production networks. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMapping of {{ecological}} continuities, which contributes {{to that of}} the green and blue belt network, is being undertaken across the country to develop <b>regional</b> <b>schemes</b> {{of ecological}} coherence. Several layers of spatial information are currently available in national databases to perform this mapping. The use of these layers raises a number of issues regarding data quality and processing, and data relevance with regard to characteristics of the studied areas and the scales at which ecological continuities are observed. The objectives of this study were to identify the ecological continuities from these data and to determine at what spatial scales these maps can be used. For this, the available layers on the Brittany region have been identified and processed to map ecological continuities at regional, community of cities and city levels. Comparative analysis of these maps to the three scales showed significant differences, stating {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each type of data according to the scale considered. It also highlights the fact that only wooded corridors can be mapped with the layers of spatial information available in national databases...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, the {{phenomenon}} of creating interstate <b>regional</b> cooperation <b>schemes</b> around the world (regionalism) has achieved high visibility and importance in world politics. The new wave of regionalism, new regionalism, which was initiated {{near the beginning of}} the 1990 s has much increased the importance of this phenomenon hence attracting significant research and academic interest. Moreover, most regions in the so-called developing world have attracted much global attention through their good economic performance and / or their increasing importance to world order and politics. Within most of these regions, neighboring states have initiated <b>regional</b> integration <b>schemes</b> (e. g. ASEAN, Mercosur, SADC, COMESA etc) which’s importance has risen along the general importance of regionalism as a worldwide phenomenon. This PhD focused on the comparative analysis of three <b>regional</b> integration <b>schemes</b> in the developing world, namely the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Southeast Asia, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Mercado Comun del Sur (Mercosur) in South America. The main argument lays on the position that in order for a <b>regional</b> integration <b>scheme</b> to be created in the developing world, the presence of a regional hegemon is needed. The methodology used is that of the comparative analysis of the three <b>regional</b> integration <b>schemes</b> under focus after a set of hypotheses / conditions has been created. This requires for an in-depth analysis of relevant theories on regionalism and interstate cooperation which in this case resulted in the adoption of an international relations’ theoretical approach as the main analytical tool to be used. The Hegemonic Stability Theory was selected and used for setting three conditions / hypotheses for testing and comparing the three <b>regional</b> integration <b>schemes</b> under focus. The main conclusion reached is that the theoretical model used, namely the Regional Hegemonic Stability Theory, can be used as the main interpretive tool of the creation of <b>regional</b> integration <b>schemes</b> in the developing world, but it seems that recent developments in Mercosur, ASEAN and SADC require a wider use of theories to be soundly explained. The existence of a hegemonic state in the different parts of the developing world has {{played a crucial role in}} the creation and development of <b>regional</b> integration <b>schemes</b> but as the world becomes more and more interdependent their impact seems to decrease. ...|$|R

40|$|The United States and China are key {{actors in}} the {{international}} effort to address global climate change. As the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gasses (GHGs), they together account for over 40 % of global GHG emissions from fossil fuels. Both countries now stand at a critical juncture on climate change policy with the upcoming COP 15 conference in Copenhagen in December 2009, where critical agreements following the Kyoto Protocol will be finalized. To be effective, any future GHG reduction scheme must have commitment from both countries and move them towards substantial long-term reductions in emissions. Experts agree that a global mechanism that ensures comprehensive emissions pricing is the most economically efficient way of achieving emissions targets; however, various political, economic and structural obstacles {{stand in the way}} of implementing ideal systems. This paper examines the implications and acceptability of proposed market based mechanisms within the current Chinese and US political economy context, including the ability of hybrid and <b>regional</b> <b>schemes</b> to encourage participation among diverse stakeholders, with heterogeneous emissions reduction capabilities...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 1990 s, local authorities in Israel have been engaged in promoting advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) projects throughout the country, resulting in the “wastewater treatment revolution” of the 1990 s. These achievements are extremely important in the water-scarce country, as untreated or partially treated wastewater has become a major source of pollution of Israel's fresh-water resources, and reuse of high-quality effluents can expand the national water potential. Many of these projects are <b>regional</b> <b>schemes</b> based on a central WWTP, serving a few neighboring municipalities. This paper presents two case studies of such regional cooperation: the “Karmiel Region Union of Towns for Sewage Treatment” and the “Treatment and Reuse of Wastewater {{in the area of the}} Hadera Stream, Ltd. ” corporation. The findings suggest that regional cooperation can be an efficient tool in promoting advanced wastewater treatment, and has several advantages: an efficient use of limited resources (financial and land); balancing disparities between municipalities (size, socio-economic features, consciousness and ability of local leaders); and reducing spillover effects. However, some problems were reported in both cases and should be addresse...|$|E
40|$|Major {{travel and}} tourism organizations, {{including}} the World Tourism Organization (WTO) and the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), agree that tourism {{will continue to}} grow significantly throughout the next two decades, with the most prolific inbound and outbound growth occurring {{in that part of the}} world (Northeast and Southeast Asia) from which most East Asian Tourism Forum (EATOF) members are drawn. This paper argues that the limiting factor to successful growth is the availability of sufficient skilled staff, with appropriate technical and interpersonal skills, to enable tourism expansion to proceed without loss of service standards. Properly devised and adequately resourced education and training programmes are essential to provide such skilled staff. This paper will elaborate on some of the tourism growth statistics and related increases in staffing needs, and raise the idea of creating regional standards of education and training. Such regional standards could be used fundamentally to help destinations to ensure the quality of tourism staff. In addition, such <b>regional</b> <b>schemes</b> could be used for marketing purposes, to assure international visitors and travel organizers of the high standards available in those destinations.

40|$|Applicant {{countries}} in transition wishing to revitalise or establish new {{ties with the}} GATT/WTO system {{will be able to}} achieve this neither in a rash nor uniform fashion. Undisputedly the necessary economic reforms in Central and Eastern Europe will take time. With respect to foreign trade, the economic reforms could be jeopardised without substantial improvement in the access to industrial country markets. However, the major remaining barriers to these markets are concentrated in sensitive areas, and protectionists' positions in favour of these barriers are generally stiff. To cushion detrimental effects of transformation and to prepare for ultimately joining the EU, particularly favourable conditions of market access have been extended in the framework of the Europe Agreements. This offer is open to a limited number of countries only. For the remaining majority of {{countries in}} transition there is some preferential treatment, the net effect of which is moderate. The alternative to <b>regional</b> <b>schemes</b> of preferences is the access to the world market as shaped by GATT/WTO provisions. Some of the applicants will {{have a long way to}} go before they qualify. For a realistic assessment of the chances of all of them, the WTO rules of accession should be clear, specified in advance, and the screening procedures transparent to avoid any impression of arbitrary decisions...|$|E
40|$|Both the European Union and the United States grant non-reciprocal {{preferences}} {{to developing}} countries under the Generalised System of Preferences as well as under several <b>regional</b> <b>schemes.</b> The benefits of these preferences have recently been questioned. Several authors have pointed out the under-utilisation of these preferences due to the constraints attached. There have been claims that rules of origin requirements and administrative costs, as well as uncertainty on eventual eligibility, have deterred exporters from using preferential regimes. We calculate various indicators of the utilisation of preferences in the agricultural, food and fisheries sector. We conclude that {{only a very small}} proportion of the imports eligible for these preferences is actually exported outside a preferential regime. The rate of utilisation is therefore high. However, the flow of imports from the poorest countries remains very limited in spite of rather generous tariff preferences, which leads to questions over the overall impact of the preferential agreements. In addition, preferential regimes overlap, and in such cases some regimes are systematically preferred to others. We use econometric estimates of the (latent) cost of using a given preference to explain why particular regimes are used. We focus on possible explanations, such as the cumulation rules (that restrict the use of materials originating from other countries), fixed administrative costs and differences in the preferential margin.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Legislation and {{regulation}} of pesticides used {{in public health}} are essential for reducing risks to {{human health and the}} environment. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the global situation on legislation and regulatory control of public health pesticides. METHODS: A peer-reviewed and field-tested questionnaire was distributed to 142 member states of the World Health Organization (WHO); 113 states completed the questionnaire. RESULTS: Legislation on public health pesticides was absent in 25 % of the countries. Where present, legislation often lacked comprehensiveness, for example, on basic aspects such as labeling, storage, transport, and disposal of public health pesticides. Guidelines or essential requirements for the process of pesticide registration were lacking in many countries. The capacity to enforce regulations was considered to be weak across WHO regions. Half of all countries lacked pesticide quality control laboratories, and two-thirds reported high concern over quality of products on the market. National statistics on production and trade of pesticides and poisoning incidents were lacking in many countries. Despite the shortcomings, WHO recommendations were considered to constitute a supportive or sole basis in national registration. Also, some regions showed high participation of countries in <b>regional</b> <b>schemes</b> to harmonize pesticide registration requirements. CONCLUSIONS: Critical deficiencies are evident in the legislative and regulatory framework for public health pesticides across regions, posing risks to human health and the environment. Recent experience in some countries with situational analysis, needs assessment, action planning, and regional collaboration has signaled a promising way forward...|$|E
