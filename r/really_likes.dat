5|$|To Ann's surprise, Chris (Rob Lowe) {{has also}} been {{admitted}} to the hospital with the flu. The two have been dating and, although Ann <b>really</b> <b>likes</b> Chris, she fears he is too perfect. However, because the extremely health-conscious Chris has a poor immune system and nearly no body fat, he suffers a complete physical breakdown, which makes Ann feel less intimidated about dating him. Meanwhile, Leslie escapes the hospital and heads back to city hall to deliver the presentation herself. Tom returns from the spa, revealing his spa friends are the owners of several car dealerships, which have agreed to lend vehicles to the festival. Although delirious with fever and an excess of flu medication, Leslie delivers a flawless presentation, wildly impressing Ben. She is immediately brought back to the hospital, where Ben tells her 110 businesses have agreed to help with the festival, surpassing the minimum 80 needed.|$|E
25|$|Ryan Yllana as Bobby - {{is one of}} Tengs best friends. A {{frequent}} joker who seldom takes anything seriously, and {{is frequently}} teased for his weight. The fact that he <b>really</b> <b>likes</b> to eat does little to stave off those remarks. In one episode, he {{was referred to as}} Captain Baboy (baboy, meaning pig in English language), in reference to his compulsive eating habits. Bobby is aware of Tengs superheroic alter ego, and is his confidant.|$|E

[...] Shortly after the PC release, Blow released resources for a level editor for Braid that allow users to import new graphics into the game.|$|E

500|$|Bee Wilson {{argues that}} the greatness of the book comes from [...] "Acton's very British sensibility. She calls a spade a spade, noting {{that some of the}} coffee served on the newfangled railway lines was a 'commercial disgrace'." [...] Wilson adds that Acton has both honesty and reticence: she does not [...] "gush" [...] when she <b>really</b> <b>likes</b> something, [...] "but puts it in brackets, as if holding her {{emotions}} in. 'Lemon Dumplings (Light and Good)', for example. Or 'Mushrooms Au Beurre (Delicious)'... that makes her Eliza Acton (The Best)." ...|$|E
500|$|Tom remains {{depressed}} {{even after}} Leslie hires a stripper (Cheryl Texiera) {{to give him}} a lap dance and [...] "grind the sorrow out of him". A drunken Tom tells Leslie that Ron plans to ask out Wendy, prompting an angry reaction from her. When Tom passes out at the bar, they take him to Wendy's house, and Leslie is shocked to find she is on a date with another man (James Ball). She storms out after expressing her disgust with Wendy and Ron. The next morning at work, Tom confesses to Leslie that it was a green card marriage, and that he only recently realized he <b>really</b> <b>likes</b> Wendy.|$|E
500|$|Anne Hathaway as Mirana of Marmoreal, the White Queen. She {{was one of}} few {{characters}} that did not require digital manipulation. Hathaway summed up her character with a caption on a magnet of Happy Bunny holding a knife; [...] "Cute but psycho. Things even out." [...] According to Hathaway, [...] "She comes from the same gene pool as the Red Queen. She <b>really</b> <b>likes</b> the dark side, but she's so scared of going too far into it that she's made everything appear very light and happy. But she's living in that place {{out of fear that}} she won't be able to control herself." [...] Hathaway described her interpretation of the White Queen as [...] "a punk-rock vegan pacifist", with inspiration drawn from Debbie Harry, Greta Garbo, and the artwork of Dan Flavin. Burton said that the White Queen's appearance was inspired by Nigella Lawson.|$|E

500|$|Warner Bros. spent $100million {{marketing}} the film. Although Inception {{was not part}} of an existing franchise, Sue Kroll, president of Warner's worldwide marketing, said the company believed it could gain awareness due to the strength of [...] "Christopher Nolan as a brand". Kroll declared that [...] "We don't have the brand equity that usually drives a big summer opening, but we have a great cast and a fresh idea from a filmmaker with a track record of making incredible movies. If you can't make those elements work, it's a sad day." [...] The studio also tried to maintain a campaign of secrecy—as reported by the Senior VP of Interactive Marketing, Michael Tritter, [...] "You have this movie which {{is going to have a}} pretty big built in fanbase... but you also have a movie that you are trying to keep very secret. Chris [...] <b>really</b> <b>likes</b> people to see his movies in a theater and not see it all beforehand so everything that you do to market that—at least early on—is with an eye to feeding the interest to fans." ...|$|E
500|$|After a {{break of}} almost four months, Beholder {{returned}} in the Torrey Pines Stakes over one mile at Del Mar on September 1, {{where she was}} ridden {{for the first time}} by Gary Stevens. She started the 1–10 favorite and led all the way, winning from second-place finisher Wittgenstein. Four weeks later, Beholder was matched against older fillies and mares in the Grade I Zenyatta Stakes over eight and a half furlongs at Santa Anita. She led from the start and won, with the six-year-old veteran Authenticity in second. Mandella called the winner [...] "a filly that <b>really</b> <b>likes</b> the fight" [...] while Stevens said that [...] "I haven't gotten close to the bottom of her yet". On November 1, Beholder contested the Breeders' Cup Distaff over nine furlongs at Santa Anita. The field was a very strong one, including Royal Delta who had won the race for the last two years, Princess of Sylmar, Authenticity, and Close Hatches. Although Beholder showed some anxiety in the starting gate, she had a clean start. Mandella had been training her so that instead of always being a front-runner, she could be [...] rated behind other horses and conserve energy. His strategy was a success as Beholder tracked the leaders before moving up into second place half a mile from the finish. She took the lead two furlongs out and went clear of the field to win by [...] lengths over Close Hatches, with Royal Delta fourth and Princess of Sylmar last of the six runners. After the race, Mandella said, [...] "I’ve been lucky enough to have many good mares in my years of training, but this mare might have to be the best of all." [...] With her Distaff win, she became the first horse to win both the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies and the Distaff in consecutive years.|$|E
2500|$|Sutcliffe told Fred Trueman that, {{although}} some batsmen can play fast bowling and some can't, [...] "if everybody told the truth, no one <b>really</b> <b>likes</b> it". [...] Trueman speaks of Sutcliffe's unselfish attitude when batting as [...] "he didn't hog the limelight". [...] Rather, {{he was a}} [...] "severely practical performer (who) had to cut out the frills as an opening batsman". [...] Sutcliffe's job was to [...] "lay the foundations" [...] of the innings; his main qualifications were having [...] "the ideal temperament" [...] and being [...] "a magnificent judge of line and length".|$|E
