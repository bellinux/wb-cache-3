5|$|The first {{aviation}} {{incident to}} result in more than 50 fatalities did not involve an airplane. On 21 December 1923, the Dixmude, a <b>rigid</b> <b>airship</b> of the French Navy, was reportedly struck by lightning and crashed into the Mediterranean Sea, off Sicily, Italy. All 52 crew and passengers were killed. Nearly 10 years later, the , also a <b>rigid</b> <b>airship,</b> encountered severe weather and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, off Barnegat Light, New Jersey, killing 73 of those on board. It was another 5 years before a fixed-wing aircraft incident claimed more than 50 fatalities. On 24 July 1938, A Curtiss Hawk II crashed into spectator stands in the Santa Ana air show disaster. 52 spectators were killed {{on the ground in}} addition to the pilot of the airplane. One month later on 24 August 1938, the Japan mid-air collision in Tokyo claimed 53 lives on the ground in addition to the 5 crew members aboard both planes.|$|E

Cliff divulges to the mobsters that the actor is a Nazi; Valentine's gang turn their weapons on Sinclair and Lothar, but Sinclair summons sixty heavily armed Nazi S.A. commandos hidden at the observatory. The Nazi <b>rigid</b> <b>airship</b> Luxembourg appears {{overhead}} to evacuate Sinclair. FBI agents suddenly announce their presence, having secretly surrounded the area; they and the mobsters join forces to battle the Nazis. Sinclair and Lothar escape, dragging Jenny with them aboard the airship.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{types of}} airship are non-rigid, semi-rigid, and <b>rigid.</b> Non-rigid <b>airships,</b> often called [...] "blimps", rely on {{internal}} pressure {{to maintain the}} shape of the airship. Semi-rigid airships maintain the envelope shape by internal pressure, but have some form of supporting structure, such as a fixed keel, attached to it. <b>Rigid</b> <b>airships</b> have an outer structural framework which maintains the shape and carries all structural loads, while the lifting gas is contained in one or more internal gas bags or cells. <b>Rigid</b> <b>airships</b> were first flown by Count Zeppelin {{and the vast majority of}} <b>rigid</b> <b>airships</b> built were manufactured by the firm he founded. As a result, <b>rigid</b> <b>airships</b> are called zeppelins.|$|R

25|$|The {{evolution}} of the <b>rigid</b> <b>airship</b> as an aircraft carrier, that was developed using Macon, led to naval planners {{coming up with the}} idea of using airships for more than scouting operations, instead operating them as offensive weapons with an air group of dive bombers. This led to the ZRCV concept, which planned for a 9 million ft3 <b>rigid</b> <b>airship,</b> significantly bigger than the Akron-class, capable of carrying up to nine Douglas-Northrop BT-1 dive bombers. However, the loss of Macon in early 1935, combined with President Roosevelt ordering a limitation on the size of new airships, meant that ZRCV was never more than an idea.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time a number of new air {{stations}} were set up as well as a training station at Cranwell. The <b>rigid</b> <b>airship</b> programme was also gathering momentum, and these stations were later joined by several more that together formed a chain all around the UK coast.|$|E
25|$|Worldwide Aeros Corp. is also {{developing}} what {{it calls}} the Aeroscraft, a <b>rigid</b> <b>airship</b> {{with a number of}} innovative features, the most important of which is a method of controlling the airship's static lift, which can be reduced by pumping helium from the internal gasbags and storing it under pressure: conversely lift can be increased by reinflating the gasbags using the stored gas.|$|E
25|$|The Aeroscraft is a <b>rigid</b> <b>airship,</b> {{having an}} {{internal}} structure {{to maintain its}} shape. As such it can reach otherwise difficult or inaccessible locations and can hover indefinitely at zero airspeed and with a full payload on board. The design incorporates cargo bays that are larger than any current air, truck or rail transport, while the payload capacity is significantly more than the current 16-ton maximum for helicopters.|$|E

25|$|The {{two ships}} were {{built as a}} {{continuation}} of the US Navy's <b>rigid</b> <b>airship</b> programme that had started just after World War I, and were used to further refine the tactics of the use of such machines in the fleet, predominantly over whether it was the airship that was the scout, with its air group only there for self-defense, or whether the airship was merely the mother ship and the aeroplanes were responsible for carrying out the long-range scouting mission.|$|E
25|$|The British R23X {{class of}} rigid {{airships}} were developed during World War I using the experiences {{gained from the}} 23 class, but {{only two of the}} planned four R23X class were built: R27 and R29.

25|$|The airship {{station was}} closed {{following}} {{the abandonment of}} <b>rigid</b> <b>airship</b> development {{after the war and}} sold to a private developer, but with the establishment of the Imperial Airship Scheme in 1924 was bought by Vickers for the construction of the airship R100. The author Nevil Shute Norway was part of the team that created the R100, working under Barnes Wallis, the engineer and later designer of the Vickers Wellington bomber, and inventor of the bouncing bomb. Shute lived at number 78 Hailgate, and a plaque is now fixed to the house to commemorate this.|$|E

25|$|No.9r {{was then}} sent to the RNAS airship station at Howden in the East Riding of Yorkshire where it {{spent most of the}} time being used for {{experimental}} mooring and handling tests. From 17 October 1917 to June 1918 it was stationed at RNAS Pulham in Norfolk where it was finally dismantled due to demand for shed space to allow construction of newer airships, having spent 198 hours and 16 minutes in the air, of which some 33 hours were at a mooring mast. Although unable to compete against contemporary Zeppelins, No.9r provided valuable experience of handling a <b>rigid</b> <b>airship</b> and the use of mooring masts, which would evolve into a unique method of mooring airships.|$|E
500|$|Saratoga was {{commissioned}} one month earlier than her sister ship, [...] As {{the ship was}} visually identical to Lexington, her funnel was painted with a large black vertical stripe to help pilots recognize her. She began her shakedown cruise on 6 January 1928 and five days later Marc A. Mitscher landed the first aircraft on board. Later that month, the <b>rigid</b> <b>airship</b> [...] was refueled and resupplied when she moored to Saratogas stern on 27 January. That same day, the ship sailed for the Pacific via the Panama Canal, although she was diverted briefly en route to carry Marines to Corinto, Nicaragua, before joining the Battle Fleet at San Pedro, California, on 21 February. On 15 September, Captain John Halligan, Jr. relieved the newly promoted Rear Admiral Yarnell.|$|E

50|$|The {{base was}} {{originally}} called Bartolomeu de Gusmão Airport {{and it was}} constructed to handle the operations with the <b>rigid</b> <b>airships</b> Graf Zeppelin and Hindenburg. Between 1931 and 1937, Deutsche Luft Hansa had regular flights between Germany and Brazil, with Rio de Janeiro as final stop. For this reason Luftschiffbau Zeppelin decided to construct a dedicated facility and move its operations from Campo dos Afonsos Airport. The airport was inaugurated on 26 December 1936. The whole complex consisted of an airfield, the hangar, a hydrogen factory and a branch-line connecting the complex to the main railway line to downtown Rio de Janeiro 54 km away among other structures. Some of the buildings are still in use, particularly the hangar which was built to accommodate the <b>rigid</b> <b>airships.</b> Because {{it is the only}} original surviving hangar built for <b>rigid</b> <b>airships</b> in the world, on 14 March 1999, it was listed as a National Heritage Site.|$|R

2500|$|HMA No. 9r was a <b>rigid</b> <b>airship</b> {{designed}} and built by Vickers at Walney Island just off Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria.
