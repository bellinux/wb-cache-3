Three methods for exciting S&Rs in the interiors of full vehicles were evaluated and sound metrics compared to subjective assessments to select the most promising excitation method. The excitation technology must be representative, controllable, realistic, and contain random-type surfaces. Excitation methods evaluated were <b>road</b> <b>tests</b> over S&R <b>surfaces,</b> <b>road</b> simulators, and direct body excitation (DBE).

40|$|Road {{roughness}} is {{the deviation}} {{of a road}} surface from a designed surface grade that influences safety conditions for road users. Mobile laser scanning (MLS) systems provide a rapid, continuous and cost-effective way of collecting highly accurate and dense 3 D point-cloud data along a route corridor. In this paper an algorithm for the automated estimation of road roughness from MLS data is presented, where a surface grid is fitted to the lidar points associated with the road surface. The elevation difference between the lidar points and their surface grid equivalents provides residual values in height {{which can be used}} to estimate roughness along the <b>road</b> <b>surface.</b> <b>Tests</b> validated the new road-roughness algorithm by successfully estimating surface conditions on multiple road sections. These findings contribute to a more comprehensive approach to surveying road network...|$|R
40|$|The tread of a tyre {{consists}} of a profile (pattern of grooves, sipes, and blocks) mainly designed to improve wet performance and inhibit aquaplaning by providing a conduit for water to be expelled underneath the tyre as it makes contact with the <b>road</b> <b>surface.</b> <b>Testing</b> different tread profile designs is time consuming, as it requires fabrication and physical measurement of tyres. We propose a supervised machine learning method to predict tyresâ€™ aquaplaning performance based on the tread profile described in geometry and rubber stiffness. Our method provides a regressor from the space of profile geometry, reduced to images, to aquaplaning performance. Experimental results demonstrate that image analysis and machine learning combined with other methods can yield improved prediction of aquaplaning performance, even using non-normalised data. Therefore this method has can potentially save substantial cost and time in tyre development. This investigation is based on data provided by Continental Reifen Deutschland GmbH...|$|R

40|$|The most {{significant}} development in modern braking is the Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) The intervention of ABS, however, {{is not always}} advantageous. Major limitations arise when ABS is applied on loose unsealed surfaces such as gravel and sand. In the event of wheel 'lock up' on unsealed surfaces, the loose material forms a wedge {{in front of the}} tyre which contributes an additional braking force and results in shorter stopping distances. This paper considers the problem of distinguishing amongst various types of road surface by means of the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of fluctuations in the spectra of the intensity of laser light reflected from the road surface. To measure these fluctuations, a test rig was constructed consisting of a visible light laser diode coupled with a light-to-voltage sensor. By mounting the sensor at a height comparable to a vehicle under body and passing it over simulated road surfaces, it is possible to generate power spectral density charts for specific surfaces. It was discovered that each of the <b>road</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>tested</b> had characteristic power spectral density charts, which could be used to discriminate between surfaces...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{variables that}} best predict a team's decision of driving ability in stroke patients from a predriving assessment. DESIGN: Retrospective {{study of a}} 2 -year predriving evaluation. SETTING: Belgian Institute for Road Safety. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred four patients with sequelae of first stroke. INTERVENTIONS: Predriving assessments and <b>road</b> <b>test.</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The suitability to resume driving based on a team decision and performance in the <b>road</b> <b>test.</b> RESULTS: Forty-one patients (39. 4 %) were judged suitable, 45 (43. 3 %) not immediately suitable, and 18 (17. 3 %) not suitable to drive. Correlation coefficients and comparisons between groups revealed that most variables had significant individual relationships with the team decision and performance on the <b>road</b> <b>test.</b> After logistic regression analysis, side of lesion, kinetic vision, visual scanning, and a <b>road</b> <b>test</b> led to the best model in predicting the team decision (R(2) =. 53). The <b>road</b> <b>test</b> {{was the most important}} determinant (R(2) =. 42). Multiple regression analysis showed that the combination of acuity of left and right eyes and the figure of Rey was the best subset to predict the <b>road</b> <b>test</b> (R(2) =. 28). CONCLUSION: The predictive accuracy of the team's decision is limited, and the <b>road</b> <b>test</b> is even lower.

40|$|Most {{published}} tyre/road noise {{tests have}} been made on new or nearly new tyres. Tyre testing {{with reference to the}} EU Directive 2001 / 43 /EC or the ECE Regulation 117 is always made on brand new, albeit run-in, tyres. Reference tyres for <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> <b>testing</b> must be in new or almost new condition. Yet, substantially worn tyres are more frequent on our roads and streets than new or almost new tyres. Only a few investigations have addressed the basic problem of how and to what extent tyre wear influences tyre/road noise. It is quite obvious that a tyre in new condition is different from a tyre in old, worn condition. Although the carcass may be essentially unchanged, the tread pattern will look and perform very differently in new and old condition, and the rubber material has changed its properties (e. g. hardness) with tyre storage and due to exposure to sunshine and wear, etc. The primary aim of the experiments was to study how much tyre wear and ageing influence noise emission of tyres running on smooth and rough surfaces. The secondary aim was to study how much tyre wear and ageing affect rolling resistance of tyres run on smooth and on rough surfaces. Alternative URL: [URL]...|$|R
