5|$|The world-famous Spanish <b>Riding</b> <b>School</b> uses {{highly trained}} Lipizzan stallions in public {{performances}} that demonstrate classical dressage movements and training. In 1572 the first Spanish Riding Hall was built, during the Austrian Empire, {{and is the}} oldest {{of its kind in}} the world. The Spanish <b>Riding</b> <b>School,</b> though located in Vienna, Austria, takes its name from the original Spanish heritage of its horses. In 1729 Charles VI commissioned the building of the Winter <b>Riding</b> <b>School</b> in Vienna and in 1735, the building was completed that remains the home of the Spanish <b>Riding</b> <b>School</b> today.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{the high}} command of Nazi Germany {{transferred}} most of Europe's Lipizzan breeding stock to Hostau, Czechoslovakia. The breeding stock {{was taken from}} Piber in 1942, and additional mares and foals from other European nations arrived in 1943. The stallions of the Spanish <b>Riding</b> <b>School</b> were evacuated to St. Martins, Austria from Vienna in January 1945, when bombing raids neared {{the city and the}} head of the Spanish <b>Riding</b> <b>School,</b> Colonel Alois Podhajsky, feared the horses were in danger. By spring of 1945, the horses at Hostau were threatened by the advancing Soviet army, which might have slaughtered the animals for horse meat had it captured the facility.|$|E
5|$|Lipizzan horses tend {{to mature}} slowly. However, {{they live and}} are active longer than many other breeds, with horses {{performing}} the difficult exercises of the Spanish <b>Riding</b> <b>School</b> well into their 20s and living into their 30s.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to examine how two <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> work with their safety. Riding {{is one of the}} most popular sports in Sweden but also very dangerous. Sweden has a lot of <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> and almost half a million that rides. Therefore it’s very {{important}} that riding, and especially <b>riding</b> at <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> has the highest level of safety with regards to harmful events. The purpose leads to the overarching research question for this essay, which is: How does the Safety work look at two <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> in the area of Karlstad? Out of this question, seven specified research questions have been constructed. They are: 1. Do the pupils get education and informed about the safety? 2. Is there one staff educated in safety questions and that have the main responsibility for the safety? 3. Do the parents consider that they get enough information about the safety? 4. Is there demands on reporting if there has been an accident and for insurance purpose? 5. Is there access to safety equipments (helmet and vest) and does the pupil use them? 6. Have the <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> taken part in Konsumentverkets work on safety? 7. Do the <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> use Ridsportförbundets safety directives? The conclusion is that both Kil and Färjestad have a good safety work at their <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> overall. There are although some deficiencies when it comes to the information about safety to parents and pupils...|$|R
40|$|Title of the work: Comparison of {{selected}} European <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> and <b>riding</b> education {{system in the}} Czech Republic Work goals: Mention all available <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> in the Czech Republic, their description and comparison with selected European <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> Methods: Analysis of literature sources and other available materials, description of individual programs of the mentioned schools, comparison {{based on the results}} of the individual schools and the level of their alumni Conclusion: The level of riding education in the Czech Republic is lower than in the compared foreign schools. The selected European schools have much longer tradition and also more elaborate education system. The Czech Republic faces lack of qualified trainers, as well as lack of funds. The success of the <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> alumni is much higher at the foreign schools than in the Czech Republic, which is caused both by the level of the alumni and more work opportunities abroad...|$|R
50|$|The Old <b>Ride</b> <b>School</b> (previously called The Old <b>Ride</b> Preparatory <b>School)</b> was an {{independent}} school in England, first at Canford Cliffs just outside Bournemouth, then Little Horwood, Buckinghamshire, and later at Bradford on Avon, Wiltshire.|$|R

5|$|The {{traditional}} horse training {{methods for}} Lipizzans were {{developed at the}} Spanish <b>Riding</b> <b>School</b> and {{are based on the}} principles of classical dressage, which in turn traces to the Ancient Greek writer Xenophon, whose works were rediscovered in the 16th century. His thoughts on development of horses' mental attitude and psyche are still considered applicable today. Other writers who strongly influenced the training methods of the Spanish <b>Riding</b> <b>School</b> include Federico Grisone, the founder of the first riding academy in Naples, who lived during the 16th century; and Antoine de Pluvinel and François Robichon de la Guérinière, two Frenchmen from the 17th and 18th centuries. The methods for training the Lipizzan stallions at the Spanish <b>Riding</b> <b>School</b> were passed down via an oral tradition until Field Marshal Franz Holbein and Johann Meixner, Senior Rider at the School, published the initial guidelines for the training of horse and rider at the School in 1898. In the mid-20th century, Alois Podhajsky wrote a number of works that serve as textbooks for many dressage riders today.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1920, the Piber Federal Stud, near Graz, Austria, {{became the}} main stud for the horses used in Vienna.

40|$|International audienceHorses' {{emotional}} reactivity is {{of a major}} {{importance in}} <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> where a variety of more or less experienced riders are present. Horses' learning abilities may also be important for work. Previous {{studies have shown that}} different intrinsic or extrinsic factors, such as breed, housing conditions, sire, and work may have an influence, and that different facilities present horses with different characteristics. In this study, we tested the reactions of 184 horses from 22 <b>riding</b> <b>schools,</b> all practicing the same type of work, but differing in particular in terms of housing conditions, to 3 emotionality tests and to one instrumental learning task, in order to (1) try and characterize <b>riding</b> <b>schools,</b> and (2) determine how general management could explain some of the potential differences observed between sites. Multivariate analysis conducted on the whole set of data showed that <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> could be classified into four categories from those where horses showed low emotionality levels and good learning abilities to those where horses showed high emotionality levels and poor learning abilities. Breed, in accordance to previous studies, {{had an impact on the}} time to cross a novel obstacle in hand (''Bridge Test'') (Kruskall-Wallis, H (14, N = 184) = 27. 08, p < 0. 05) while housing conditions (e. g. box housing) influenced emotionality (emotionality index, MW: p < 0. 05), when horses were released in the arena. Box housing was associated with more active locomotion patterns (including trot, canter and passage) (MW: p < 0. 005). These results underline the importance for <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> to take into account both the individual characteristics of the horse, and in particular the breed, and to consider the impact of general management including housing conditions, on horses' reactivity, and its consequences in terms of human security.

5|$|The first {{evacuation}} of the 20th century occurred in 1915 when {{the horses were}} evacuated from Lipica due to World War I and placed at Laxenburg and Kladrub. Following the war, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was broken up, with Lipica becoming part of Italy. Thus, the animals were divided between several different studs in the new postwar nations of Austria, Italy, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia. The nation of Austria kept the stallions of the Spanish <b>Riding</b> <b>School</b> and some breeding stock. By 1920, the Austrian breeding stock was consolidated at Piber.|$|E
5|$|The {{rescue of}} the Lipizzans by the United States Army, {{made famous by}} the Disney movie Miracle of the White Stallions, {{occurred}} in two parts: The United States Third Army {{under the command of}} General George S. Patton, was near St. Martins in the spring of 1945 and learned that the Lipizzan stallions were in the area. Patton himself was a horseman, and like Podhajsky, had competed in the Olympic Games. On May 7, 1945, Podhajsky put on an exhibition of the Spanish <b>Riding</b> <b>School</b> stallions for Patton and Undersecretary of War Robert P. Patterson, and at its conclusion requested that Patton take the horses under his protection.|$|E
5|$|The {{rest of the}} National Constituent Assembly {{followed}} the king within two weeks to new quarters in Paris. In short order, the entire body settled {{in only a few}} steps from the Tuileries at a former <b>riding</b> <b>school,</b> the Salle du Manège. However, some fifty-six monarchien deputies did not come with them, believing the mob threat in the capital to be personally dangerous. The October journées thus effectively deprived the monarchist faction of significant representation in the Assembly as most of these deputies retreated from the political scene; many, like Mounier, fled the country altogether.|$|E

5|$|Until the 18th century, Lipizzans {{had other}} coat colors, {{including}} dun, bay, chestnut, black, piebald and skewbald. However, gray is a dominant gene. Gray {{was the color}} preferred by the royal family, and so the color was emphasized in breeding practices. Thus, in a small breed population when the color was deliberately selected as a desirable feature, {{it came to be}} the color of the overwhelming majority of Lipizzan horses. However, it is a long-standing tradition for the Spanish <b>Riding</b> <b>School</b> to have at least one bay Lipizzan stallion in residence, and this tradition is continued through the present day.|$|E
5|$|A pony-sized Finnhorse must measure no {{more than}} 148cm (14.2-1/2 hands, 58-1/2inches) at the withers or the croup. Both sexes are also {{required}} to pass either a drivability or a ridability test. The horse's pedigree is also evaluated, and uncharacteristically small individuals descending from larger-sized lines are not accepted. The horse should be proportionately small all over, and express all the qualities of a full-size Finnhorse. Especially thorough {{attention is paid to}} the pony-sized horse's character, obedience and cooperation. The pony-sized Finnhorse is suited to practically any use the larger Finnhorse is, with the exception of heavy draught work because of its smaller size and proportionally reduced strength. However, some individuals have been able to compete with and even win against full-size Finnhorses in work horse competitions. Many pony-sized individuals are cross-registered for trotter section breeding, as small Finnhorses can be equal competitors in harness against larger ones. In combined driving, the pony-sized Finnhorse's size is an advantage, allowing for greater agility. The section is popular for therapy and <b>riding</b> <b>school</b> use.|$|E
5|$|From {{the north}} of the hall are two further approaches. The Eccleston Approach goes to the village of Eccleston, and {{slightly}} to the west, the Chester Approach bypasses the village, going through Eccleston Hill. Associated with these approaches are further listed buildings. Of these, the major structure is Eccleston Hill Lodge which was designed in 1881–82 by Douglas for the 1stDuke and is listed at GradeII*. This is a three-storey gatehouse tower with multiple attached smaller towers and a steeply hipped roof. The other structures are listed at GradeII and comprise Eccleston Lodge which was designed by Douglas and Fordham in 1894, its associated gates, piers and wing railings, a sandstone balustered causeway south of the lodge carrying the drive, a house called Eaton Boat, designed by Douglas about 1880, Garden Lodge designed by Waterhouse in 1881–83, a pair of gates, railings and screen walls adjoining the lodge dating from 1881–83 by Waterhouse, Stud Lodge storehouse and domestic offices, designed in 1883 by Douglas, the Stud <b>Riding</b> <b>School,</b> the Stud Stables, the house east of Stud, Eaton Estate Office, designed by Waterhouse in 1880, the North Lodge of 1881 by Waterhouse, the North Lodge gate and post from about 1881 also by Waterhouse, the Garden House of 1893 by Douglas and Minshull, and gates and gate piers to the south of Garden House.|$|E

5|$|The mounted police {{initially}} deployed with 310 {{horses in}} 1873, both as mounts and as draught animals, but {{large numbers of}} these died on the march, and {{for much of the}} 1870s there were shortages of horses, impacting on the police's work. The importance of horses to the force's work grew, particularly once the new patrol system was introduced by Commissioner Herchmer. By the 1880s the police's horses were looked after carefully and given good veterinarian support, although they were worked very hard. A large <b>riding</b> <b>school</b> was built in Regina at a cost of $30,000 in 1886 to allow training throughout the cold winter months. At their peak {{towards the end of the}} century, the force owned around 800 horses, and needed to purchase 100 new mounts each year. The police initially used a wide range of saddlery, mostly of the British Army's Universal pattern, but this was found to be unsuitable for the prairies. After some experimentation, the force settled on the Western, or Californian, style of saddle in the 1880s, which was more comfortable for both the rider and horse.|$|E
5|$|Five other chapels were {{demolished}} {{during the}} area's 20th-century redevelopment. The Sussex Street Strict Baptist Chapel {{stood on the}} section of that road which is now named Morley Street. It had lancet windows and a stuccoed exterior, and opened in 1867. The congregation moved out in 1895, and St Margaret's Church in Cannon Place established a mission hall in the building. The Circus Street market {{was built on the}} site after its demolition in 1937. Also on Sussex Street, a Primitive Methodist chapel was founded in 1836. The Kingswood Flats now occupy the site of the building, which closed in about 1950. Mighell Street Hall, demolished in 1965, stood on land now covered by Amex House. It was used by Baptists from 1878, then as the church hall of St John the Evangelist's, and finally (from January 1949) by Spiritualists. When the new Brighton National Spiritualist Church, a figure-of-eight concrete building, opened on Edward Street in 1965, the hall closed for good. The Carlton Hill Apostolic Church stood for 99 years until 1964, although its Catholic Apostolic congregation moved out in 1954. Latterly it was used as student housing for the adjacent Brighton Art College, which extended its premises onto the site when the building was demolished. The Salvation Army had a citadel at the junction of Edward Street and the now vanished <b>Riding</b> <b>School</b> Lane (near Mighell Street) from 1884 until 1965, when it was demolished for road widening. The denomination registered another building for worship and marriages in 1971: it stood at the junction of Carlton Hill and Mighell Street, and was deregistered in 1985.|$|E

40|$|International audienceHorses’ {{behaviour}} in <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> is {{of a wide}} importance regarding caretakers’ and users’ security. Previous {{studies showed}} that numerous intrinsic or extrinsic factors, such as breed, housing conditions, sire, and work could modulate horses’ emotional and cognitive abilities. Here, we compared the behaviour of 184 horses from 22 <b>riding</b> <b>schools,</b> practicing {{the same type of}} work, but differing in particular in terms of housing conditions proposed. Three emotionality tests (the arena and the novel object tests, with the horse released alone in a known arena and faced or not with a novel object, the bridge test with the horse led by the experimenter across a mattress) and one instrumental learning test (the chest test: in the box, the horse tries to open a wooden chest) were used to characterize the schools and determine how general management could explain the potential differences between sites. For the arena and novel object tests, emotionality indices were calculated, as well as frequencies of occurrence of active locomotion patterns (trot, canter and passage). For the bridge and the chest tests, times spent to cross or open were recorded. The ANOVAs and FCA showed that <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> could be classified amongst four categories according to the behaviour of their horses. In accordance to previous studies, two factors appeared to be particularly relevant: breed, that impacts on the time to cross the bridge (Kruskall-Wallis, H(14, N = 184) = 27. 08, P< 0. 05) and housing conditions with box housed horses showing higher levels of emotionality (MW: P< 0. 05). These results underline the importance for <b>riding</b> <b>schools</b> owners {{to take into account the}} individual characteristics of the horse, and to have a questioning about the impact of general management on horses’ reactivity, and the consequences in terms of security. Other factors (feeding practices, work conditions [...] .) remain to be tested...|$|R
