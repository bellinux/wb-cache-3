5|$|In 1984 Robert Holmes à Court, {{the wealthy}} Australian {{investor}} who owned ATV Music Publishing, {{announced he was}} putting the ATV catalog up for sale. In 1981, McCartney was offered the ATV music catalog for £20 million ($40 million). According to McCartney, he contacted Yoko Ono about making a joint purchase by splitting the cost at £10 million each, but Ono thought they could buy it for £5 million each. When {{they were unable to}} make a joint purchase, McCartney, {{who did not want to}} be the sole owner of the Beatles' songs, did not pursue an offer on his own. According to a negotiator for Holmes à Court in the 1984 sale, McCartney was given first <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> and declined to purchase. Jackson was informed of the sale by his attorney, John Branca, in September 1984. An attorney for McCartney also assured Branca that McCartney was not interested in bidding. McCartney reportedly felt it was too expensive, but several other companies and investors were interested in bidding. Jackson submitted a bid of $46 million on November 20, 1984. His agents thought they had a deal several times, but encountered new bidders or new areas of debate. In May 1985, Jackson's team left talks after having spent more than $1 million and four months of due diligence work on the negotiations. In June 1985, Jackson and Branca learned that Charles Koppelman's and Marty Bandier's The Entertainment Company had made a tentative agreement with Holmes à Court to buy ATV Music for $50 million; however, in early August, Holmes à Court's team contacted Jackson and talks resumed. Jackson raised his bid to $47.5 million, which was accepted because he could close the deal more quickly, having already completed due diligence of ATV Music. Jackson also agreed to visit Holmes à Court in Australia, where he would appear on the Channel Seven Perth Telethon. Jackson's purchase of ATV Music was finalized on August 10, 1985.|$|E

40|$|I {{examine the}} {{economic}} {{costs and benefits}} <b>of</b> granting a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> first <b>refusal</b> to one <b>of</b> two bidders in a procurement auction. This right permits the favored bidder to win a contract by matching the bid of the competing bidder. Such a right, is often observed in business interactions, especially procurement. It is commonly thought that the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> first <b>refusal</b> lowers the payoff to the auctioneer; however, I show conditions under which the auctioneer benefits. I also explore the effect of allowing the auctioneer to set a reserve price and find that the benefits <b>of</b> a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> first <b>refusal</b> still hold. An endogenous reserve price diminishes the cost-reducing effect <b>of</b> a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> first <b>refusal.</b> Both the reserve price and the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> first <b>refusal</b> serve to elicit more aggressive bids and hence, to a certain degree, are substitute tools. Generally, a reserve price will exacerbate asymmetry, while a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> first <b>refusal</b> will reduce asymmetry. ...|$|R

This right permits the favored bidder to win a contract by matching the bid of the competing bidder and is often observed in procurement auctions.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> first <b>refusal</b> and <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> first {{offer in}} a multiple-buyer, sequential bargaining setting. A <b>right</b> <b>of</b> first <b>refusal</b> entitles the right-holder {{to purchase a}} subject asset on the same terms as those accepted by a third party. A <b>right</b> <b>of</b> first offer requires a seller to first offer the right-holder to buy a subject asset and prohibits the seller from subsequently selling the asset to a third party on better terms than those offered to the right-holder. We examine when and how such rights yield benefits to or impose costs on the right-holder and the seller. We show that a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> first <b>refusal</b> transfers value from other buyers to the right-holder, but may also force the seller to make suboptimal offers. A <b>right</b> <b>of</b> first offer induces the seller to lower his first-period offer, which will tend to increase the net surplus to the seller and right-holder, but also forces the seller to make suboptimal subsequent offers. We find conditions under which {{it is in the}} ex ante interest of the seller and the right-holder to contract for a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> first <b>refusal</b> or a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> first offer, respectively...|$|R

2500|$|To avoid over {{development}} the Gibneys {{had a series}} of deed restrictions placed on the selling of their land. The deed restricted the property to a one family dwelling. In order to preserve the perfect and natural beauty of the land, the placement of any structure had to be pre-approved by the Gibneys. The Gibneys also placed deed restrictions that prohibited the rental of the property. [...] Also, in their deed, they had the right to repurchase the property if and when the Oppenheimers wanted to sell the land. This first <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> was {{the most important part of}} the deed to the Gibneys. At first, the Gibney's deed did not seem to restrict the Oppenheimers, but they began renting their vacation cottage, soon after it was built, through the local real estate agency. The Gibneys disapproved, and the Oppenheimers argued against the Gibneys and said that the tenants they were renting to were “just friends of theirs”. When Robert Oppenheimer died, Kitty began construction on a second building. Once again, the Gibneys protested and Kitty pleaded that this building was, “just a tool shed”. [...] The so-called “tool shed” was built on the property line between the Gibneys and the Oppenheimers, and was too close to the beach according to the Gibneys. That Christmas, both of the buildings built by the Oppenheimers were rented out to, “just friends”. The friendly relationship between the Gibneys and the Oppenheimers ended.
