Imaging {{is one of the most}} ubiquitous tools used by orthodontists to measure and record the size and form of craniofacial structures. Materials and Methods: The objectives of the study were to compare the measurements from human skulls and their images from cephalometric radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scanograms in order to gauge the potential use of CT in routine clinical practice. Based on the specific criteria including stable occlusion and condyles fitting stably in glenoid fossa, 15 dry human skulls were selected. Lateral, posteroanterior cephalograms, and CT scout views were taken of each skull by standardized methods. Linear measurements were made on all three records. Intraclass correlation coefficients, Pearson′s correlation coefficient and <b>regression</b> <b>constant</b> were calculated to assess the records. Results: The linear measurements of the cephalometric record are greater than CT measurements on scout images.

The prepared nanoadsorbents were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and BET surface area analysis.

40|$|Abstract—We have searched {{to define}} the major {{arterial}} parameters that determine aortic systolic (Ps) and diastolic (Pd) pressure in the dog. Measured aortic flows were used as input to the 2 -element windkessel model of the arterial system, with peripheral resistance calculated as mean pressure divided by mean flow and total arterial compliance calculated from the decay time in diastole. The windkessel model yielded an aortic pressure wave from which we obtained the predicted systolic (Ps,wk) and diastolic (Pd,wk) pressures. These predicted pressures were compared with the measured systolic and diastolic pressures. The measurements and calculations were performed for 7 dogs under control conditions during aortic occlusion at 4 locations (the trifurcation, between the trifurcation and diaphragm, the diaphragm, and the proximal descending thoracic aorta) and during occlusion of both carotid arteries. Under all conditions studied, the predicted systolic and diastolic pressures matched the experimental ones very well: Ps,wk 5 (1. 00060. 0055) Ps with r 50. 958 and Pd,wk 5 (1. 02460. 0035) Pd with r 50. 995. Linear regression for pulse pressure (PP) resulted in PPwk 5 (0. 9960. 016) PP with r 50. 911. We found the accuracy of prediction equally good under control conditions and {{in the presence of}} aortic or carotid artery occlusion. Multiple regression between pulse pressure and arterial resistance and total arterial compliance yielded a poor <b>regression</b> <b>constant</b> (R 250. 19), suggesting that the 2 arterial parameters alone cannot explain pulse pressure and that flow is an important determinant as well.

The aim was to supply basic information on the form of growth {{of the population of}} M. furnieri that uses the bay, as well as to assess changes in the fish condition. Most fish were young and subadults. The length-weight equation, based on 2499 unsexed individuals, was Wt = 0. 009095 * Lt 2. 99, where Wt is the total weight (g) and Lt is the total length (cm).

Spatially, the best condition was observed in the inner bay zone, where most fish were young-of-the-year, and in the outer zone where predominate larger sized fish, indicating that individuals of intermediary size could be allocating large amount of energy for growth, presenting, consequently, lowest condition.

30|$|As {{considered}} in the discussion following Eqs. (1) and (2), it was an implicit assumption of the ratio estimators used here that the target-auxiliary variable relationship can be represented as a straight line passing through the origin (Cochran 1977, Sect. 6.7; Särndal et al. 1992, Sect. 7.3; Gregoire and Valentine, 2008, p. 167). This {{is not a problem}} with model-assisted estimation because the intercept of the relationship on the target variable axis (the parameter α in Eqs. 1, 6.1 and 6.2) is determined and used directly as part of the estimation process. When the population example data used here were adjusted by addition of a constant to the target variable values, so that the target-auxiliary variable relationship was no longer through the origin, additional simulation studies found that the efficiency of all the ratio estimators declined and rapidly became much less than results obtained using simple random sampling if the constant used was large enough (results not reported here). However, it was found also that if the target-auxiliary variable relationship for any sample did not pass through the origin, it could easily be made to do so by fitting a straight line regression to the data and then transforming the sample data by subtracting the <b>regression</b> <b>constant</b> from all the target variable values in the sample. The modified data would then yield an estimate of the population mean (to which the constant that had been subtracted was added back) and would also yield the correct estimate of the standard error of the estimate of population mean because the variance of the sample data was unaffected by the transformation (these results also not reported here). Thus, even if the target-auxiliary variable relationship does not pass through the origin, it is quite simple to transform sample data so that any of the ratio estimators used here may be applied satisfactorily.|$|E
40|$|The {{motivation}} for writing U. S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 85 - 95 was to (1) {{show that the}} linear regression approach of transferring low-flow statistics (e. g., 7 -day, 10 -year low flow) from an index station to a partialrecord site was biased and (2) propose an alternative unbiased estimator. Most analysts who use a mathematical technique, use linear regression analysis to relate base-flow measurements to concurrent daily flows at an index station. Therefore {{it is important to}} document that this technique is biased. The purpose of this summary is to clarify the important conclusions presented in Open-File Report 85 - 95. Riggs (1972) describes how base-flow measurements at partial-record sites can be used to estimate low-flow statistics such as the 7 -day, 10 -year low flow. Riggs suggested the following estimator T (R) T XbaY + = (1) where =(R) TY D-day, T-year low-flow value in log units at the partial-record site, =TX corresponding D-day, T-year low-flow value in log units at the index station, and a, b = <b>regression</b> <b>constant</b> and coefficient. Unless otherwise noted, all estimates of low flows, means and variances are expressed in log units (base 10). Estimates of a and b are made by relating base-flow measurements at the partial-record site to concurrent daily mean flows at the index station. Riggs (1972) used graphical techniques to estimate a and b. As the use of computers became more prevalent, many analysts began to use linear regression analysis to define a and b. This latter technique is shown to be biased in Open-File Report 85 - 95 and an unbiased technique is proposed. The proposed unbiased technique (Stedinger and Thomas, 1985) involves first estimating the mean and variance of the annual D-day low flows at the partial-record site. These two statistics are then used to estimate the D-day, T-year low flows at the partial-record site. This is in contrast to equation 1 where the D-day, T-year low flow is estimated directly from the corresponding value at the index station. The following estimators for the mean and variance were proposed. xm bayµ + = and (2...|$|E
