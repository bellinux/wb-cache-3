40|$|International audienceThis article {{presents}} a Round Addition Analysis on a software {{implementation of the}} Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. The round keys are computed on-the-fly during each encryption. A non-invasive transient fault injection is achieved on the AES round counter. The attack is performed by injecting a very short electromagnetic glitch on a 32 -bit microcontroller based on the arm Cortex-M 3 processor. Using this experimental setup, {{we are able to}} disrupt the <b>round</b> counter <b>increment</b> {{at the end of the}} penultimate round and execute one additional round. This faulty execution enables us to recover the encryption key with only two pairs of corresponding correct and faulty ciphertexts...|$|R

50|$|The NICHD {{nomenclature}} defines baseline fetal {{heart rate}} as:The baseline FHR {{is determined by}} approximating the mean FHR <b>rounded</b> to <b>increments</b> of 5 beats per minute (bpm) during a 10-minute window, excluding accelerations and decelerations and periods of marked FHR variability (greater than 25 bpm). There {{must be at least}} 2 minutes of identifiable baseline segments (not necessarily contiguous) in any 10-minute window, or the baseline for that period is indeterminate. In such cases, {{it may be necessary to}} refer to the previous 10-minute window for determination of the baseline. Abnormal baseline is termed bradycardia when the baseline FHR is less than 110 bpm; it is termed tachycardia when the baseline FHR is greater than 160 bpm.|$|R
50|$|During testing {{some of the}} Object 187 prototypes were {{fitted with}} the 125 mm 2A46M smoothbore gun of the T-80B. Planned primary {{armament}} of the tank though was the ballistically improved 125 mm 2A66 smoothbore gun. Together with the gun, a new uranium-cored sub-caliber armor-piercing round was developed. The 2A66 had a different appearance to the 2A46M. A muzzle brake was installed primarily to keep a clear line-of-sight for the missile guidance system, while also decreasing effective recoil from the more powerful new gun. The barrel was strengthened, with chamber volume increased to accommodate the larger <b>round</b> and <b>incremented</b> charge. The tank was equipped with the most advanced fire control system of the time. Something similar began to appear more widely on tanks in the late 1990s.|$|R
50|$|Having {{found the}} desired number of digits, {{you can easily}} {{determine}} whether or not you need to <b>round</b> up; i.e., <b>increment</b> the last digit. You don't need to find another digit to see if it is equal to or greater than five. Simply append 25 to the root and compare that to the remainder; if it is {{less than or equal to}} the remainder, then the next digit will be at least five and round up is needed. In the example above, we see that 6839925 is less than 11669900, so we need to round up the root to 6840.0.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Some years ago, Crack and Ledoit (1996) {{discovered}} a strikingly geometric structure when plotting US stock returns against themselves. Since this pattern, in which lines radiating from the origin pop up, resembles the navigating tool {{it was named}} Compass Rose. Although authors differ in opinion when explaining {{the causes of the}} phenomenon, discreteness of price jumps is unanimously indicated as driver of the structure. This paper first documents the presence of a Compass Rose Structure within the illiquid Belgian stock market, looking at both individual stocks and stock indices. We then examine whether the presence of a Compass Rose, i. e. the discreteness of prices, affects normality tests. Based on simulated Brownian Motions with <b>rounded</b> price <b>increments,</b> we notice that two commonly used normality tests react differently to discreteness in the underlying data. As the tick size increases, the popular Jarque-Bera test is not able to detect the deviations from normality. The Lilliefors test, however, clearly rejects the normality assumption when the data exhibit tick/volatility ratios in excess of 2. 5...|$|R
5000|$|Bid is {{amount of}} scores player states he can achieve in this round. Every game round {{there has to}} be a player who has an {{obligation}} to get 100 or more scores, the player is determined by bidding round - the player who made the bigger bid wins the bidding round.. In order to support / give this player advantage - stock will be given to the player who wins the bidding round.After cards are dealt, player next clock-wise after the dealer starts the bidding with 100 points, this player is often called [...] "first hand". Players after observing their hand cards are taking part in bidding one-by-one strictly clock-wise in order. Only after previous player stated his bid or passed his turn, next player can bid. When both of opponent player will pass (will not make bigger bid), the player who make biggest bid wins the bidding round. It is possible that after first hand player said initial bid of 100 points - both of the opponent players can pass, in this case first hand player has no options and wins the bidding round.If a player passes bidding turn, he passes it permanently for this game round and can not make bid even if bidding turn came back again to him, he is not taking part in bidding for this <b>round</b> anymore.Minimum bid <b>increment</b> is 5 points, all bids have to be divisible by 5.

40|$|AIM: There is {{debate as}} to what {{constitutes}} an adequate excision margin {{to reduce the risk}} of locoregional recurrence (LRR) after breast cancer surgery. We have investigated the relationship between surgical margin distance and LRR in women with invasive breast cancer (IBC). METHODS: Tumour free margin distances were extracted from histopathology reports for women with IBC, treated by either breast conserving surgery or mastectomy, enrolled in the Breast Cancer Treatment Group Quality Assurance Project from July 1997 to June 2007. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were conducted to compare the risk of LRR for involved margins compared with negative margins, measured in <b>increments</b> <b>rounded</b> to the nearest mm. RESULTS: 88 of 2300 patients (3. 8 %) experienced an LRR after a mean follow-up of 7. 9 years. An involved margin, or a margin of 1 mm was associated with an increased risk of LRR (HR 2. 72, 95 % CI 1. 30 - 5. 69), whilst margin distances of 2 mm or greater were not. Risk of LRR with margin distances < 2 mm was particularly high amongst those not receiving radiotherapy (RT). CONCLUSION: Based on our findings, we recommend that a tumour free margin distance of 2 mm be adopted as an adequate margin of excision for IBC, in the setting of patients receiving standard adjuvant RT and adjuvant drug therapies as dictated by the current clinical treatment paradigms.

40|$|The round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) is {{extremely}} invasive fish species, capable to reach high abundance and make {{significant impact on}} invaded ecosystem. First round gobies occured in the Lithuanian part of the Baltic Sea in 2002. The population passed establishment (2002 - 2010), expansion (2011 - 2012) and adjustment (2013 - 2015) phases. Rapid <b>round</b> goby abundance <b>increment</b> induced dramatic decline of its major prey - the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis), which in turn negatively affected population of wintering long-tailed duck (Clangula hyemalis). Food competition between round goby and long-tailed duck was evaluated analysing changes in their diet composition, feeding efficiency and feeding niche overlap during different round goby invasion phases. During establishment both species preyed mainly on M. edulis; during expansion, the diet of round goby was dominated by M. edulis, Crangon crangon and Macoma balthica, while in the last invasion period it shifted to polychaetes. Long-tailed duck shifted its diet from epibenthic blue mussel to fish prey during round goby expansion and adjustment phases. Feeding efficiency of the round goby decreased from 100 % (percentage of full guts) determined during establishment to 80 % and 68 % during expansion and adjustment phases, respectively. The highest percentage of feeding long-tailed ducks was observed {{in the beginning of}} round goby invasion (74 %), it dramatically declined during 2011 - 2012 (26 %) and recovered (53 %) during 2015 - 2016. Feeding niche overlap between round goby and long-tailed duck was biologically significant during round goby establishment, but it lost significance after drastic decline of the blue mussel in natural environment...|$|R
