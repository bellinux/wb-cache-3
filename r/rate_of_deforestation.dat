Its habitat has been highly fragmented, with forest patches isolated by severely degraded grasslands.

25|$|Since 1990, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>deforestation</b> in the DRC has {{remained}} constant at 0.20%, which equates {{to the loss}} of 311,000 hectares, or roughly 1,200 square miles, annually. This amounts to destroying forests the size of Delaware every two years. The fact that the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>deforestation</b> {{has remained}} constant over the last twenty years is misleading as one might believe that government or non-government organizations (NGO) interventions have been responsible for the decline, but reports indicate otherwise. Three reasons have been postulated as to why deforestation rates have remained relatively low: 1) the road network within the country has been gradually in decline making access to more remote areas more difficult, 2) political and regulatory changes have disincentivized investment in the country, and 3) agriculture has expanded outside of forest areas.|$|E

25|$|Pittas are {{generally}} forest birds {{and as such}} are vulnerable to habitat loss caused by rapid deforestation. They can also be difficult birds to survey and are easily overlooked. Four species are assessed to be endangered, and a further nine are listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Additionally eight species are listed as near-threatened and one, the Louisiade pitta, is too poorly known to be assessed and is listed as data deficient. The Gurney's pitta was not seen for 34 years between 1952 and 1986, before a small population was discovered in southern Thailand. This small population continued to decline since its rediscovery, and by 2000 it had reached a low of 10 pairs, and was listed as critically endangered. In 2003 the species was found in Burma {{for the first time}} since 1914, and in large numbers, between nine and thirty five thousand pairs. Although the species was considerably less threatened than thought, it is still of considerable conservation concern as deforestation of the habitat in Burma continues. The rapid <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>deforestation</b> in Borneo has pushed the blue-headed pitta, previously considered common and secure as recently as 1996, into the list of species considered vulnerable. Pittas have also been targeted by poachers for the illegal wild bird trade. They are not targeted because of their song, as many songbirds are, and may simply be captured as bycatch from collecting other species, and because of their attractive plumage. According to some trappers they also may end up being eaten for food. On Manus, locals report that predation by snakes, including the brown tree snake, is responsbile for the rarity of the endangered superb pitta, but the snake, which is responsible for a number of extinctions across the Pacific, is native to the island.|$|E

Digital land use/land cover maps at scale 1 : 250, 000 from three different dates (1993, 2002 and 2007) were revised and integrated into a GIS database along with ancillary data (road network, settlements, topography, land tenure and socio-economical parameters).
