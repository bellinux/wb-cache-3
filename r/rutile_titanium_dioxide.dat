30|$|<b>Titanium</b> <b>dioxide</b> (TiO 2) or titania is a {{well-known}} photocatalyst material. Anatase, <b>rutile,</b> brookite and <b>titanium</b> <b>dioxide</b> (B) or TiO 2 (B) are the four mineral forms of TiO 2. It {{has been found that}} anatase TiO 2 takes part in photocatalytic reaction more efficiently than the other forms of <b>titanium</b> <b>dioxide</b> (Tanaka et al. 1991). This superiority originates from its band gap, which is 3.2  eV, compared to 3.0  eV of rutile. It means the conductive zone of anatase type is 0.2  eV higher and therefore is more favorable for driving conjugate reactions involving electrons. Moreover, during photooxidation reaction, very stable surface peroxide groups can be formed in the anatase type of this oxide (Baraton and Merhari 2004; Luo and Ollis 1996). Furthermore, there are also studies which claim that a mixture of anatase (70 – 75  %) and rutile (30 – 25  %) is more active than pure anatase (Muggli and Ding 2001; Ohno et al. 2001).|$|R

The mixture of the two isomers leads acrylated urethane resins to contain three oligomers (II, 111 and IV) in the final product.

Under such conditions, mass transfer in the OFPR was enhanced. Optimum photocatalytic activity for selected TiO 2 was achieved when the reactions were conducted with catalyst concentrations at 0. 5 g/L for Aldrich rutile and 0. 02 g/L for Degussa P 25 respectively. The rate of SA degradation was similar for the two catalysts; but the mineralization rate for micro-aggregated size Aldrich rutile TiO 2 was higher than nano-aggregated size P 25 when both catalysts received {{the same amount of}} UV flux. Reaction with micro-aggregated size TiO 2 was enhanced by the mass transfer due to local turbulence caused by oscillatory flow mixing. The photocatalytic reaction can be divided into two stages of development. In the first stage, salicylic acid was degraded to intermediates by hydroxyl radicals generated from photolysis of H 2 O 2. The amount of strong UV absorbing intermediates reduced the UV flux reaching the reactor wall. In the second stage, the intermediates were mineralized to carbon dioxide and water. The degradation was enhanced by the photocatalytic reaction on the catalyst. The first stage is the rate-limiting step while the second stage is mass transfer-limiting. lnvestigation of reaction intermediates from the degradation of salicylic acid was carried out using LC/MS. Dihydroxybenzoic acid and trihydroxybenzoic acid were found to be the primary intermediates; both are highly UV-absorbing organic compounds...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{was focused}} on the {{preparation}} of self-cleaning and photocatalyticaly active <b>titanium</b> <b>dioxide</b> thin films. Transparent and porous thin layers of <b>titanium</b> <b>dioxide</b> were prepared from sol-gel containing titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) as precursor with addition polyethylene glycol (PEG). Transparent thin layers of <b>titanium</b> <b>dioxide</b> were also prepared from colloidal solution <b>titanium</b> <b>dioxide.</b> The immobilization of thin <b>titanium</b> <b>dioxide</b> layers was performed by a sol-gel process on the soda lime glasses. Diffusion of sodium cation from soda lime glasses into <b>titanium</b> <b>dioxide</b> layer were blocked. Sol was deposited by printig method – micropiezo deposition. Sol and thin <b>titanium</b> <b>dioxide</b> layers were characterised by the physical-chemical method. For prepared sol viscosity, density and surface tension were measured. Thickness and hydrophilicity of <b>titanium</b> <b>dioxide</b> layers also were studied. The photocatalytic activity of the printed titanium layers were tested via the photocatalytic degradation of the 2, 6 -dichlorindophenol. The influence of addition PEG into the sol and influence of sol loading was studied. It was found that the addition of PEG into the sol significantly increased the photocatalytic activity of <b>titanium</b> <b>dioxide</b> layers...|$|R
