40|$|Linking {{observed}} or estimated ground incoming {{solar radiation}} with cloud coverage is difficult since {{the latter is}} usually poorly described in standard meteorological observation protocols. To investigate the benefits of detailed observation and characterization of cloud coverage and distribution, a fieldwork campaign {{has been set up}} in order to collect data about cloud cover conditions and daily evolution to directly analyse their impacts on solar <b>radiation</b> <b>fluxes.</b> To do so, daytime hemispherical images have been collected at a very high frequency, simultaneously to ground measurements of solar <b>radiation</b> <b>fluxes</b> in a scientific station close to Lake NamCo, China. After calibration, one of the main tasks was the classification of those hemispherical images and the extraction of meaningful indices to describe the cloud cover, such as cloud fraction or cloud cover distribution. The classification is based on automatic detection of threshold on the red channel histogram. The results show that several cloud indices could be successfully derived from the hemispherical images, even if very thin clouds can be difficult to detect. The indices are then correlated to the measured solar radiation values and the impact of cloud cover on surface <b>radiation</b> <b>fluxes</b> were analysed.

The vertical profile of the atmospheric net <b>radiation</b> entropy <b>flux</b> follows approximately that of the atmospheric net longwave <b>radiation</b> entropy <b>flux.</b> Sensitivity study further reveals that a ‘darker’ atmosphere with a larger overall atmospheric longwave optical depth exhibits a smaller net <b>radiation</b> entropy <b>flux</b> at all altitudes, suggesting an intrinsic connection between the atmospheric net <b>radiation</b> entropy <b>flux</b> and the overall atmospheric longwave optical depth.

It is well {{established}} that potential evapotranspiration (PET) can be reliably estimated using the energy budget at the canopy or land surface. However, {{in most cases the}} necessary measurements are not available. Because of this, many mostly-empirical temperature-based models have been developed and are widely used. Here we test whether a radiation based model (Priestley-Taylor) can reliably predict PET using air temperature to estimate the <b>radiation</b> <b>fluxes.</b> We used data from the AmeriFlux network to approximate net radiation from daily minimum and maximum temperature measurements, day of the year, and geographic location of the sites; i. e., readily available data in most places. We found good agreement between Priestley-Taylor PET calculated from measured <b>radiation</b> <b>fluxes</b> and Priestley-Taylor PET determined primarily via air temperature. The most difficult parameter to estimate was the atmospheric transmissivity to in-coming solar radiation. Overall the results suggest that radiation-based PET esti-mates can be made even when direct measurements of the <b>radiation</b> <b>fluxes</b> are unavailable...|$|R
40|$|Measurements {{of the net}} {{radiation}} balance of two forested sites on the opposite slopes of a valley in south-western Germany, made over 3 years, are presented in this study. Radiation sensors were mounted horizontally on two measurement towers above two beech stands. The direct part of the measured short-wave incoming radiation was adjusted according to the slope’s angle to convert horizontally measured radiation data into surface-parallel <b>radiation</b> <b>fluxes.</b> During periods when contemporaneous measurements of slope-parallel and horizontal <b>radiation</b> <b>fluxes</b> were available, the calculation of surface-parallel <b>radiation</b> <b>fluxes</b> from the horizontally recorded {{net radiation}} components were compared with measured values. The net radiative fluxes parallel to the slopes were calculated {{for a period of}} 36 months and analysed. Results show that the different aspects of both sites cause significant differences of the net radiation balance. In June, when the elevation of the sun is highest, incoming solar radiation K¯ received on the NE-slope was 9 % lower than K¯ received on the SW-slope. During the winter months, the differences were much greater and incoming solar radiation to the NE-slope was 50 % of that to the SW-slope. Due to the differing solar irradiance, net <b>radiation</b> <b>fluxes</b> were significantly higher on the SW-slope than on the NE-slope. For long-wave radiation only small differences between both slopes could be found.

40|$|The {{high-resolution}} {{measurements of}} the spectral solar irradiance {{at the top of}} the Earth's atmosphere by the Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) satellite suggest significant deviation of solar radiation from the commonly assumed blackbody radiation. Here, we use these spectral irradiance measurements to estimate the Earth's incident solar <b>radiation</b> entropy <b>flux,</b> and examine the importance of a proper estimation approach. The Earth's incident solar <b>radiation</b> entropy <b>flux</b> estimated by directly applying the observed spectral solar irradiance into the most accurate Planck expression is compared with that estimated with a conventional approach that uses the Sun's brightness temperature under the assumption of a blackbody Sun. The globally averaged non-blackbody incident solar <b>radiation</b> entropy <b>flux</b> {{at the top of the}} Earth's atmosphere equals 0. 31 W m− 2 K− 1 . This value is about 4 times larger than that estimated from the conventional blackbody approach, with the difference comparable to the typical value of the entropy production rate associated with atmospheric latent heat process. Further analysis reveals that the decrease of spectral solar <b>radiation</b> entropy <b>flux</b> with <b>radiation</b> traveling distance, unlike the decrease of spectral solar <b>radiation</b> energy <b>flux</b> with <b>radiation</b> traveling distance, is wavelength dependent, and that the difference between the two estimates can be attributed to the fact that the conventional approach ignores the influence of radiation traveling distance on the spectral solar <b>radiation</b> entropy <b>flux.</b> Moreover, sensitivity study further shows that the distribution of top-of-atmosphere spectral solar irradiance could significantly impact the magnitude of the estimated Earth's incident solar <b>radiation</b> entropy <b>flux.</b> These results together suggest that the spectral distribution of incident solar radiation is critical for determining the Earth's incident solar <b>radiation</b> entropy <b>flux,</b> and thus the Earth's climate...|$|R
