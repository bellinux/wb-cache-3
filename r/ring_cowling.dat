50|$|Except for {{the engine}} change and its Townend <b>ring</b> <b>cowling,</b> the YP-20 was not {{drastically}} {{different from the}} P-6 from which both it and the P-11 derived, though the YP-20 had more fin and less rudder area, and featured a steerable tailwheel, rather than the original skid. Later, a crankcase cover, gear strut fairings, and wheel pants were added.|$|E

40|$|Although the {{application}} of a <b>ring</b> <b>cowl</b> to an airplane with an air-cooled engine increases the maximum L/D and the high speed to an appreciable extent, the performance in climb and ceiling is not increased as much as one would expect without analyzing the conditions. When a <b>ring</b> <b>cowl</b> is installed on an airplane, the propeller is set at a higher pitch to allow the engine to turn its rated r. p. m. at the increased high speed. V/nD is increased and the propeller efficiency at high speed is increased slightly. The ratio of r. p. m. at climbing speed, V(sub c), to the r. p. m. at maximum speed, V (sub m) is dependent upon the ratio of V(sub c) to V(sub m). The increase in V(sub c) for all airplane with <b>ring</b> <b>cowl</b> i s not as great as the increase in V(sub m), so that the ratio V(sub c) /V(sub m) is less than for the airplane without ring. Consequently the r. p. m. and full throttle thrust power available are less at V(sub c) for the airplane with <b>ring</b> <b>cowl</b> and in spite of the increase in L/D due to the installation of the ring, the excess thrust power available for climbing is not appreciably changed. The same method of reasoning accounts for the small increase in absolute ceiling in spite of a large increase in L/D maximum...|$|R

5000|$|The short {{fuselage}} {{was also}} a welded steel tube structure, alloy skinned front and rear but with a fabric covered central section that contained the tandem seats under a continuous, multi-framed canopy which merged into the rear fuselage. The Wn 16's pusher configuration, [...] Salmson 9Ad nine cylinder radial engine was installed within a Townend <b>ring</b> <b>cowling</b> {{at the rear of}} the fuselage beyond the wing, driving a two blade propeller. The Wn 16 was later re-engined with a [...] Walter Mikron.|$|E
2500|$|The last, {{and most}} {{numerous}} production version, the Scout D, gradually came about {{as the result}} of a series of further improvements to the Scout C design. [...] One of the earliest changes appeared on seventeen of the 75 naval Scout Cs with an increase in the wing dihedral angle from ° to 3° and other aircraft in the 75 aircraft naval production run introduced a larger-span set of horizontal tail surfaces and a broadened-chord rudder, shorter-span ailerons and a large front opening for the cowl, much like that of Scout B but made as a [...] "one-piece" [...] <b>ring</b> <b>cowl</b> instead.|$|R
2500|$|In 1916 an {{improved}} version appeared as the Nieuport 16 {{which was a}} strengthened Nieuport 11 airframe powered by a 110hp (92kW) Le Rhône 9J rotary engine.

Later versions had a fuselage-mounted synchronized Vickers gun, but in this configuration the combined effect of the heavier 9J engine and the Vickers gun compromised maneuverability and made the craft nose-heavy. The Nieuport 16 was an interim type pending the delivery of the slightly larger Nieuport 17 C.1 which was designed for the heavier engine and machine gun with a new, full-perimeter <b>ring</b> <b>cowl,</b> and remedied the 16's balance problems, as well as improving performance.|$|R

50|$|Lisichkin and Rentel {{designed}} the LK-1 {{in an attempt}} to build a very efficient small transport aircraft with the wing blending into the fuselage, forming the cockpit and cabin, with seats for three passengers and one pilot with extensive glazing. Construction was all of wood/plywood, with a conventional single spar wing with plywood covering. The engine, with Townend <b>ring</b> <b>cowling,</b> was fitted on the centre-line between the font cockpits which gave the pilot an asymmetrical view through the leading edge glazing. The fixed tricycle undercarriage was fitted with spats to reduce drag.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{powered by}} a Wright Whirlwind J-5 of [...] {{take-off}} power and [...] nominal power, produced in the Polish Skoda Works as the Skoda-Wright J-5. This drove a two-blade metal propeller and was fitted with a Townend <b>ring</b> <b>cowling.</b> The PWS-54 had a conventional fixed undercarriage with a rear wheel. Each mainwheel was mounted on a V-form, steel tube strut hinged to the lower fuselage, with long, vertical shock absorber legs to the wings. The wheels were enclosed with spats that split into fore and aft sections for servicing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{prototype}} of a development, the J-6S, built for Jona by Piero Magni Aviazione was flying by 1938. This aircraft, {{intended as a}} military trainer, was powered by a 240 hp (180 kW) Alfa Romeo D2C.30 radial engine {{and did not have}} the tilting wing but was otherwise closely similar to the J-6. [...] The J-6S lacked a Townend <b>ring</b> <b>cowling</b> on the nine-cylinder radial, was slightly shorter with the front cockpit set slightly further aft and had a tailwheel instead of a skid. Six J-6S were built and used by the Staff Training Squadron at Centocelle Airport. One was armed in April 1940. They were later stored at Milan-Bresso and destroyed in an air raid in early 1942.|$|E

50|$|The SAB-SEMA 10 {{failed to}} gain a {{production}} contract when the competition was won by the Romano R.82. It was then re-engined with a more powerful 300 hp (224 kW) Lorraine 9Na Algol nine-cylinder radial with a Townend <b>ring</b> <b>cowling.</b> At the same time wing and tail modifications were made and the aircraft redesignated the SAB-SEMA 12. This was a single-bay biplane with N-form interplane struts. The lower wing had a smaller chord than the upper one but both carried ailerons, externally connected. The fuselage was flat sided and the tailplane was mounted on top of it. The fin was tall and the rudder extended {{to the bottom of}} the fuselage, moving between separate elevators. It had a conventional undercarriage with mainwheels in spats.|$|E
5000|$|The LEM-3 was {{designed}} by Yuri Vladimirovich Domrachayev & Leonid Sergeyevich Vild'grub as a very high efficiency transport akin to a motor-glider, with high aspect ratio wings and a low-powered engine. The all wood LEM-3 had a conventional tricycle undercarriage, long span wings were supported by a truss running from approx 1/3 span {{to the bottom of}} the u/c legs to the other wing. The initial version had a side-by-side open cockpit, for the two pilots, and an eight-seat cabin with four bench sets under hinged roof access panels with small windows as well as four cargo compartments in the enlarged wing roots. The engine drove a U-2 Propeller, with which the flight tests began in 1936. The factory testing was completed by early [...] when the aircraft was flown to Moscow for testing at the NII GVF(Naoochno-Issledovatel'skiy Institoot Grazdahnskovo Vozdooshnovo Flota - scientific test institute for civil air fleet), unfortunately the aircraft suffered a forced landing on arrival at the NII GVF airfield and further work was abandoned. A modifiied version with a large enclosed cabin, trousered main undercarriage, anti nose-over skid and Townend <b>ring</b> <b>cowling,</b> was mooted in a contemporary drawing, but there is no evidence that this version was built, modified, or flown.|$|E
25|$|The prototype, XFJ-1, {{was sent}} to Anacostia for testing after its initial flights, where the ground-looping habit was noted, and {{eventually}} resulted in a landing accident, necessitating return and repair. The company {{took the opportunity to}} add a Townend <b>ring</b> engine <b>cowling,</b> and upgraded the engine from a 450-hp Pratt & Whitney R-1340C to a 500-hp R-1340-92 Wasp. This and other improvements boosted speed from 177 to 193mph, and the Navy gave the reconstructed aircraft the designation XFJ-2. However, improved performance came at the expense of stability, and the ground loop problem persisted, and there was no interest in continuing with this design. Nevertheless, the prototype continued to be used for other tests for several years.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{powered by}} a [...] Lorraine 7Me Mizar seven {{cylinder}} radial engine which had a Townend <b>ring</b> type <b>cowling</b> and drove a two blade metal propeller with a conical spinner. Behind the engine the fuselage was fabric covered and flat sided, though with a polygonal underside and decking. The forward cockpit was under the upper wing trailing edge where a slight cut-out improved the pupil's upward view. The instructor's cockpit was further back. The C.251s empennage was conventional, with tailplane and elevators mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage and having a planform similar to the wins, apart from a cut-out for rudder movement. The fin profile was a shallow triangle; the rudder continued its upper line to a rounded tip and straight, vertical trailing edge.|$|R
5000|$|... 34 {{production}} aircraft (including prototypes).

They were built in July-December 1939 (MM 21689-21707 and 21847-21849). The limited production resulted in a curtailing of further type development.|$|R

The greater part of the tests were made with a Curtiss XF 7 Cc- 1 (Sea Hawk) with a 410 horsepower. Wasp engine, using three fuselage nose shapes and six types of outer cowling. The six cowlings were: a narrow ring, a wide <b>ring,</b> a wide <b>cowling</b> similar in the original NACA <b>cowling,</b> a thick <b>ring</b> incorporating an exhaust collector, a single-surface cowling shaped like the outer surface of the exhaust-collector cowling, and polygon-ring cowling, of which the angle of the straight sections with the thrust line could be varied over a wide range...|$|R

5000|$|The Rainbow {{featured}} a wing of straight taper with squared tips and high aspect ratio for maximum efficiency. The engines {{featured a}} sliding cowl arrangement to facilitate cooling airflow {{instead of the}} normal cowl flaps, which caused too much drag. At {{the front of the}} cowls, the engines were also fitted with a two-stage [...] "impeller fan" [...] directly behind the propeller hub and prop spinner. This allowed the engines to be tightly cowled for aerodynamic efficiency, but still provide the cooling airflow the engines required. When the sliding <b>cowl</b> <b>ring</b> was closed (during flight), the air used for cooling the engine was ducted through the nacelle to the rear exhaust orifice for a net thrust gain, as opposed to the usual cooling drag penalty.|$|R
50|$|The NiD 690 {{was a high}} wing, {{cantilever}} monoplane, {{with wings}} which were trapezoidal in plan. Its Algol engine was in the nose within a narrow-chord, Townend <b>ring</b> type <b>cowling</b> and behind it the forward and central metal-covered fuselage was, apart from the roof, flat-sided and rectangular in section. The pilots' enclosed cockpit was under the wing leading edge with all-around glazing of the multi-panel type and with lower side windows for better downward vision. Colonial aircraft were expected to fill a variety of roles, including transport, bombing, reconnaissance, observation, policing and medical, so needed a large and reconfigurable internal space. Since policing involved observation of and intervention in ground events, clear views and wide fields of machine gun fire were required. As on the NiD 590, Nieuport provided a long cabin behind the cockpit with windows on each side under the mid-wing and the trailing edge; towards {{the rear of the}} cabin its walls came closer together until they met the rear fuselage, which was T-shaped in section and built from three longerons, with T-shaped bulkheads and metal covering. Long wall openings towards the rear of the cabin allowed a gunner at its narrow convergence to fire backwards and downward {{as well as to the}} sides.|$|R
50|$|The 801 used a {{relatively}} complex system, {{integral to the}} BMW-designed, matching forward cowling system, to cool the lubricating oil. A ring-shaped oil cooler core was built into the BMW-provided forward cowl, just behind the fan. The outer portion of the oil cooler's core was {{in contact with the}} main cowling's sheetmetal, to possibly act as a heat sink. Comprising the BMW-designed forward cowl, in front of the oil cooler was a ring of metal with a C-shaped cross-section, with the outer lip lying just outside the rim of the cowl, and the inner side {{on the inside of the}} oil cooler core. Together, the metal <b>ring</b> and <b>cowling</b> formed an S-shaped airflow path, with the oil cooler's core contained between them. Airflow past the gap between the cowl and outer lip of the metal ring produced a vacuum effect that pulled air from the front of the engine outward and forward within the cowl's frontmost inner area just behind the fan, flowing forward across the oil cooler core in a separate airflow path from the rearwards-direction flow that cooled the engine's cylinders, just to provide cooling for the 801's oil. The rate of cooling airflow over the core could be controlled by moving the metal ring slightly forward or aft in order to open or close the gap.|$|R
50|$|The PWS-12 was a single-engined two-seat {{training}} biplane, fit {{also for}} aerobatics, designed in 1928 by A. Grzędzielewski and August Bobek-Zdaniewski at the PWS factory. The design shared similar parts, including fuselage and engine, as a high-wing trainer fighter plane PWS-11, {{developed at the}} same time. The main difference was {{the addition of a}} lower wing. It was powered by a nose-mounted Skoda-built version of the Wright J-5 Whirlwind radial engine. Two prototypes and an airframe for static tests were ordered by the Aviation Department of the War Ministry in February 1928 (along with the PWS-11 prototypes). The first prototype was flown by Franciszek Rutkowski in November 1929. It was later improved - among others, a Townend <b>ring</b> replaced NACA <b>cowling,</b> and it was fitted with N-shaped struts between wings instead of perpendicular struts. The second improved prototype was flown on 18 November 1930, and designated PWS-12bis. Testing was successful and a production order for 20 aircraft was placed by the Polish Air Force.|$|R
50|$|When the radial {{air-cooled}} engine was first introduced, the engine cylinders were cooled by exposing {{them to the}} air stream. In 1929 the NACA reported the results of some tests in which the cylinders were enclosed by a sheet-metal <b>ring</b> or <b>cowling,</b> which {{became known as the}} NACA cowling. This cowling reduced the drag of the radial engine to less than 20% of its original value and gave sufficient cooling for flight operation. In order to improve the cooling available with this cowling, deflectors or baffles were used to guide the airflow close to the cylinders. With the combination of baffles and cowling, a large gain over the exposed engine in both cooling and drag was realized. At that stage of development, cut-and-try methods were largely used in cowling design. Often a supposed improvement in design resulted in a decrease in performance and cooling. In 1935 NACA mounted a comprehensive investigation of the cowling and cooling problem, the general purpose of which was to furnish data on the physical functioning of the propeller-nacelle-cowling unit under varied flight conditions. The information obtained embodies the detailed principles ofoperation. If a complete understanding of the cowling and cooling problem is obtained, determining the installation dimensions becomes simple. Since an airplane designer has neither the time nor the opportunity to acquire a detailed knowledge of every part of the airplane, he wants a simple method of obtaining the optimum cowling dimensions, and some of the more important reasons for selecting these dimensions. It is the purpose of this report to present such a method and to illustrate the method by working a few examples.|$|R

2500|$|The {{eventual}} {{choice of}} the BMW 801 14-cylinder radial over the more troublesome BMW 139 also brought with it a BMW-designed cowling [...] "system" [...] which integrated the radiator used to cool the motor oil. An annular, ring-shaped oil cooler core was built into the BMW-provided forward cowl, just behind the fan. The outer portion of the oil cooler's core was {{in contact with the}} main cowling's sheet metal. Comprising the BMW-designed forward cowl, in front of the oil cooler was a ring of metal with a C-shaped cross-section, with the outer lip lying just outside the rim of the cowl, and the inner side {{on the inside of the}} oil cooler core. Together, the metal <b>ring</b> and <b>cowling</b> formed an S-shaped duct with the oil cooler's core contained between them. Airflow past the gap between the cowl and outer lip of the metal ring produced a vacuum effect that pulled air from the front of the engine forward across the oil cooler core to provide cooling for the 801's motor oil. The rate of cooling airflow over the core could be controlled by moving the metal ring in order to open or close the gap. The reasons for this complex system were threefold. One was to reduce any extra aerodynamic drag of the oil radiator, in this case largely eliminating it by placing it within the same cowling as the engine. The second was to warm the air before it flowed to the radiator to aid warming the oil during starting. Finally, by placing the radiator behind the fan, cooling was provided even while the aircraft was parked. The disadvantage to this design was that the radiator was in an extremely vulnerable location, and the metal ring was increasingly armoured as the war progressed.|$|R
5000|$|Inline and radial engines {{were both}} {{incorporated}} into the Kraftei concept : the Junkers Jumo 211 was a pioneering example of engine unitization, as used on both the Junkers Ju 88 using a novel annular radiator for both main engine coolant and engine oil cooling needs, with exactly the same nacelle packaging used to power the Messerschmitt Me 264 V1's first flights. Both the examples of the Dornier Do 217 medium bomber powered by inline engines, and the Axis Powers' largest-flown powered aircraft of any type, the Blohm & Voss BV 238 flying boat used essentially the same unitized Daimler-Benz DB 603 powerplants, complete with [...] "chin" [...] radiators under the nacelles as integral components. A differing Kraftei physical packaging is also {{believed to have been}} crafted by the Heinkel firm for the DB 603 engines used on its Heinkel He 219A night fighter, as {{what appears to be the}} same exact engine installation design used for the He 219A was also used for the quartet of ordered airframes for the same firm's He 177B four-DB 603-engined heavy bomber design's prototype series, as both airframe types' engine [...] "units" [...] used annular radiators and cylindrical cowls of identical appearance to enclose them. The air-cooled BMW 801 fourteen-cylinder, twin-row radial engine was also provided in both formats for a number of German designs, especially for twin and multi-engined airframes, with the [...] "M" [...] or [...] "T" [...] first suffix letter designating whether it was a Motoranlage (the original format of the Kraftei concept) or the more comprehensively consolidated Triebwerksanlage format unitized powerplant — the BMW-designed forward <b>cowling</b> <b>ring</b> always used with the 801 incorporated the engine's oil cooler, making it an easy task for aviation engineers to use for such a [...] "unitized" [...] mounting concept.|$|R
