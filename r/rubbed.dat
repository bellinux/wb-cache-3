50|$|Pericardial {{friction}} <b>rub</b> {{is one of}} several, similar sounds. A {{differential diagnosis}} may be possible, or not, depending upon the number of components that are audible.

One- and two-component <b>rubs</b> are ambiguous. A three-component <b>rub</b> distinguishes a pericardial <b>rub</b> and indicates the presence of pericarditis. Also, a pleural <b>rub</b> can only be heard during inspiration and expiration, whereas, the pericardial <b>rub</b> can be heard even after cessation of breathing. Pleural <b>rub</b> creates pain mostly on the lateral part of the chest wall, whereas pain due to pericardial <b>rub</b> is always central in location.

40|$|The rubella virus (<b>RUB)</b> {{capsid protein}} (C) is a {{multifunctional}} phosphoprotein with roles beyond encapsidation. It {{is able to}} rescue a large lethal deletion of the Q domain in the P 150 replicase gene at a step in replication before detectable viral RNA synthesis, indicating a common function shared by <b>RUB</b> C and the Q domain. The goal of this dissertation was to use constructs containing the N-terminal 88 amino acids of <b>RUB</b> C, the region previously defined as the minimal region required for the rescue of Q domain mutants, to elucidate the function of <b>RUB</b> C in Q domain rescue and viral RNA synthesis. In the first specific aim, the rescue function of 1 - 88 <b>RUB</b> C {{and the importance of}} an arginine-rich cluster, R 2, within 1 - 88 <b>RUB</b> C for rescue were confirmed. Rescue was not correlated with intracellular localization or phosphorylation status of <b>RUB</b> C. In the second specific aim, the involvement of <b>RUB</b> C in early events post-transfection with <b>RUB</b> RNA was analyzed. <b>RUB</b> C specifically protected <b>RUB</b> transcripts early post-transfection and protection required R 2. However, it was concluded the protection observed was due to the encapsidation function of <b>RUB</b> C and not related to Q domain rescue. No differences in the translation of the <b>RUB</b> nonstructural proteins in {{the presence or absence of}} <b>RUB</b> C were observed. Interactions of <b>RUB</b> C with host cell proteins were analyzed. Although the interaction of <b>RUB</b> C with cellular p 32 required the R 2 cluster, both wild type (does not require <b>RUB</b> C for replication) and RQQ (requires <b>RUB</b> C for replication) Q domain bound p 32, indicating interaction with this binding partner is not the basis of rescue. Using a human protein array phosphatidylinositol transfer protein alpha isoform (PITPα) was found to interact with <b>RUB</b> C but not its R 2 mutant. However, co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that this protein binds both forms of <b>RUB</b> C. Although the mechanism behind the rescue of the <b>RUB</b> P 150 Q domain by <b>RUB</b> C remains unknown, we propose a model that <b>RUB</b> C plays a role in generation of the virus replication complex in infected cells...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Rubbing</b> {{between the}} rotor and the stator is the {{frequent}} fault and will cause very serious accident, even catastrophe, to rotating machinery. Therefore, timely detection of such <b>rubbing</b> {{is very important}} avoid severe consequences. Vibration based methods are very mature and traditional methods but not effective to detect incipient <b>rubbing</b> in rotating machinery. <b>Rubbing</b> between the rotor and the stator will cause elastic strain in the <b>rubbing</b> location and thus can produce acoustic emission (AE).

In this paper, the AE based method is proposed for detecting and identifying the <b>rubbing</b> of the rotor-bearing system. An experimental study is presented to investigate the characteristics and features of <b>rubbing</b> AE using parameter analysis method.

Because the operating state of turbocharger in the life cycle changes as the work condition of diesel engine changes, the compressor wheel <b>rub</b> of turbocharger is applied by the variable stress which can causes the fatigue failure. In this paper, the effect of centrifugal load, thermal load and aerodynamic load on the stress of compressor wheel <b>rub</b> is studied, and then the fatigue stress spectrum of compressor wheel <b>rub</b> is developed based on the endurance test profile of vehicle engine. In order to research the fatigue strength of compressor wheel <b>rub,</b> the fatigue specimen is designed {{and the relationship between}} the stress and fatigue life of compressor wheel <b>rub</b> is built. Then, utilizing the linear Miner cumulative damage rule and the first-order reliability method, the reliability model of compressor wheel <b>rub</b> with fatigue failure mode is derived, and the rule that the reliability of compressor wheel <b>rub</b> changes with life is studied. Based on the reliability model of compressor wheel <b>rub</b> with fatigue failure mode developed, the method for determining the reliable fatigue life of compressor <b>rub</b> of turbocharger is proposed.
