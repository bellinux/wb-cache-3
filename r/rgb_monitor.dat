5000|$|BASIC 8 (or BASIC 8.0) [...] - [...] "The Enhanced Graphics System For The C128" [...] - [...] {{developed}} by Walrusoft of Gainesville, Florida {{and published in}} 1986 by Patech Software of Somerset, New Jersey, USA, was an extension of Commodore's BASIC 7.0 for the C128 home/personal computer. BASIC 8.0 provided commands lacking in BASIC 7.0 to generate (color) graphics in the C128's high-resolution 80-column mode (640&times;200 pixels) for <b>RGB</b> <b>monitors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The various RGB (red, green, blue) analog {{component}} video standards (e.g., RGBS, RGBHV, RGsB) use no compression and impose no real limit on color depth or resolution, but require large bandwidth {{to carry the}} signal and contain much redundant data since each channel typically includes {{much of the same}} black-and-white image. Most modern computers offer this signal via a VGA port. Many televisions, especially in Europe, utilize RGB via the SCART connector. All arcade games, other than early vector and black-and-white games, use <b>RGB</b> <b>monitors.</b>|$|R

5000|$|A third 320&times;200 4-color palette is {{achieved}} by disabling the composite color burst bit while in graphics mode. This is what IBM BIOS Mode 5 does, as described above. This switches the current color palette to red, cyan, white and the background color. The intense versions of these colors {{can also be used}} and the background color may be changed, but the palette cannot be switched to official palettes 0 or 1 without enabling the composite color signal again. As such, it can only be seen on <b>RGB</b> <b>monitors</b> and will simply appear in grayscale on composite displays. This palette was often used by games because it looked more attractive than the cyan/magenta/white colors. Notably, it is not mentioned in the IBM Technical Reference manual, and some CGA clones may not support it.|$|R
5000|$|When the CGA was {{introduced}} in 1981, IBM did not offer an RGBI monitor. Instead, customers were supposed to use the RCA output with an RF modulator (that they obtained separately, from a third party) to connect the CGA to their television set. The IBM 5153 Personal Computer Color Display would not be introduced until March 1983. Resulting {{from the lack of}} available RGBI monitors in 1981 and 1982, many users would use simpler <b>RGB</b> <b>monitors</b> (without provisions for the [...] "intensifier" [...] bit), reducing the number of available colors to eight, and displaying both colors 6 and 14 as yellow. This is relevant insofar as if an application or game programmer used either one of these configurations, they will have expected color 6 to look dark yellow instead of brown.|$|R

50|$|The Linux Kit {{turns the}} PlayStation 2 into a {{full-fledged}} computer system, {{but it does}} not allow for use of the DVD-ROM drive except to read PS1 and PS2 discs due to piracy concerns by Sony. Although the HDD included with the Linux Kit is not compatible with PlayStation 2 games, reformatting the HDD with the utility disc provided with the retail HDD enables use with PlayStation 2 games but erases PS2 Linux, though there is a driver that allows PS2 Linux to operate once copied onto the APA partition created by the utility disc. The Network Adaptor included with the kit only supports Ethernet; a driver is available to enable modem support if the retail Network Adaptor (which includes a built-in V.90 modem) is used. The kit supports display on <b>RGB</b> <b>monitors</b> (with sync-on-green) using a VGA cable provided with the Linux Kit, or television sets with the normal cable included with the PlayStation 2 unit.|$|R
50|$|Viggiano {{found that}} white {{balancing}} in the camera's native RGB color model tended to produce less color inconstancy (i.e., less {{distortion of the}} colors) than in <b>monitor</b> <b>RGB</b> for over 4000 hypothetical sets of camera sensitivities. This difference typically amounted to a factor {{of more than two}} in favor of camera RGB. This means that it is advantageous to get color balance right at the time an image is captured, rather than edit later on a monitor. If one must color balance later, balancing the raw image data will tend to produce less distortion of chromatic colors than balancing in <b>monitor</b> <b>RGB.</b>|$|R

5000|$|By Viggiano's measure, {{and using}} his model of {{gaussian}} camera spectral sensitivities, most camera RGB spaces performed better than either <b>monitor</b> <b>RGB</b> or XYZ. [...] If the camera's raw RGB values are known, one {{may use the}} 3x3 diagonal matrix: ...|$|R
5000|$|... 40&times;25 {{characters}} {{in up to}} 16 colors. Each character is a pattern of 8&times;8 dots. The effective screen resolution in this mode is 320&times;200 pixels (a pixel aspect ratio of 1:1.2), though individual pixels cannot be addressed independently. The choice of patterns for any location is thus limited {{to one of the}} 256 available characters, the patterns for which are stored in a ROM chip on the card itself. The display font in text mode (the hardware code page 437 character set) is therefore fixed and cannot be changed (although when using the original IBM CGA, it is possible to select one of two different fonts—normal or thin—by changing a jumper. Many clones didn't offer this possibility). The card has sufficient video RAM for eight different text pages in this mode. BIOS Modes 0 & 1 select 40 column text modes. The difference between these two modes can only be seen on a composite monitor; mode 0 disables the color burst, making colors appear in grayscale. Mode 1 enables the color burst, allowing for color. Mode 0 and Mode 1 are functionally identical on <b>RGB</b> <b>monitors</b> and on later adapters that emulate CGA without supporting composite color output.|$|R

50|$|The <b>RGB</b> display <b>monitor</b> for the X1 had a {{television}} tuner, {{and a computer}} screen could be super-imposed on TV. All the TV functions could be controlled from a computer program. The character font was completely programmable (A.K.A. PCG) with 4bit color, and it was effectively used {{into a lot of}} games. The entirety of the VRAM memory was mapped on to the I/O area, so it was controlled without bank change. Since X1 had these features, it was very powerful for game software.|$|R
50|$|Usually soft {{proof is}} done in {{software}} applications in combination with color management systems. The monitor used for soft proofing must be calibrated, so that {{the image on the}} screen looks like the image on the paper. The major problem is the difference of color spaces (<b>RGB</b> in <b>monitor</b> and CMYK in print), and this is solved by using ICC profiles for input and output devices. Moreover, colors on a monitor depend not only on its properties, but also on lighting conditions in a room where the image is viewed. Usually, lighting is standardized and is close to a daylight (D50).|$|R
5000|$|If {{the image}} may be {{transformed}} into CIE XYZ tristimulus values, the color balancing may be performed there. This has been termed a “wrong von Kries” transformation. Although it has been demonstrated to offer usually poorer results than balancing in <b>monitor</b> <b>RGB,</b> it is mentioned here as a bridge to other things. Mathematically, one computes: ...|$|R
