Bond analysis between ECC and rebar, in which fiber bridging effect of ECC at crack is considered, is conducted under the assumption of the bond stress - slippage relationship. Analysis results show that the tension-stiffening effect between ECC and steel rebar is relatively small rather than bridging action of ECC. It is also confirmed that bridging stress is smaller than crack strength of ECC as the average and strain capacity of ECC increases due to <b>restriction</b> of <b>crack</b> localization...|$|R
40|$|A major {{result of}} the use of the double {{cantilever}} beam test to provide a measure of the interlaminar fracture energy in composites subjected to simple Mode I-type loading is the observation that increasing the toughness of the matrix resin by as much as a factor of 20 produced a major (approximately four-fold) increase in interlaminar fracture energy. The data presently analyzed show that, with brittle polymers, resin toughness is fully transferred to the composite, while in the case of tougher polymers the resin toughness is only partially transferred due to the fibers' <b>restriction</b> of the <b>crack</b> tip deformation zone in the polymer, together with their changing of local stress field details. Factors which tend to increase interlaminar toughness are fiber nesting and bridging, as well as fiber breakage and pull-out during crack growth...|$|R

A certain minimum dimensioning of the reinforcement is required to assure a sufficient <b>crack</b> <b>restriction.</b> In the frame of this project {{the influence of the}} hydration heat on the material parameters and on the strain of the reinforcement have been subjected to experimental and numerical investigations.

The results suggested that with very strong laser scattering, the depth resolution of ZTA materials was very poor, which lead to a very significant amount of the signal being collected from the subsurface regions below the plastic zone. It was also found that zirconia phase transformation reduced the compressive residual stress in the alumina matrix within the plastic zone, except at the indentation centre, due to the tensile residual microstress generated by the zirconia phase transformation. In addition, the dislocation density on the indent surface of the ZTA samples was significantly reduced due to the <b>restriction</b> of <b>crack</b> propagation and energy absorption during the phase transformation process.

40|$|Abstract Today {{there is}} an {{opportunity}} to reinforce concrete with steel fiber reinforcement. In some cases, completely replace the conventional reinforcement. Replacing conventional mesh reinforcement with steel fiber reinforcement in slabs on ground has shown economic benefits, less crack width and less reinforcement amount. Today there are no Swedish standard for designing steel fiber reinforced concrete, what is there is different international recommendations. In this work, design methods for steel fiber concrete are used according to RILEM and Bekaer Swedish AB's software DRAPRO. For other design methods Eurokod 2 is followed. In this work, the design of slabs on ground that are not exposed by large tension strength been designed. Design of crack-reinforcement and <b>restrictions</b> of <b>crack</b> width have been conducted in three different slabs on ground. The calculations have been performed using only conventional reinforcement and only steel fiber reinforcement, and the results are then compared. The results of the theoretical analysis are summarized in tables that compare the amount of reinforcement, crack width and economic cost. This work showed that the slabs on the ground reinforced with steel fibers provide less crack width with a minor amount of reinforcement. The use of steel fiber concrete was also shown to reduce the reinforcement costs by about 70 - 75 %. The absence of a Swedish standard may have caused some uncertainty among Swedish structural engineers using steel fiber reinforced concrete and there is a limited understanding of the material advantages. This may be a reason for the use of steel fiber concrete is relatively small in Sweden. Another reason why the use of steel fiber concrete is not expanding may be that the current mesh is so easy to reinforce with and is therefore used of traditional reasons. Hopefully, this work will make structural engineers to review the possibility of using steel fiber reinforcement instead of conventional mesh reinforcement in slabs on grade. Partly because of its economic advantage but also its ability to minimize crack width with a reminiscent reinforcement amount, which in turn can be beneficial from an environmental perspective...|$|R
40|$|A surface strain {{measurement}} {{approach to}} understanding of delamination processes of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) under heat cycle conditions {{was described in}} this paper. Heat cycle tests between the high temperature ranged from 1473 K to 1073 K and the relatively low temperature (573 K) was carried out on thermal barrier coated type 304 stainless steel specimens. 8 mass%Y 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 and Al 2 O 3 coatings {{were used for the}} TBCs. The surface strain behavior during the heat cycle test was measured using a laser speckle strain/displacement gauge (SSDG). It was found that the thermal expansion of a substrate was almost reflected on a surface strain if a delamination wasnt initiated, while the value of a surface strain decreased to the value of the thermal expansion of a ceramics-coating if the delamination of the ceramics-coating was initiated. The state of a subsurface delamination was able to be nondestructively inferred by the surface strain behavior. The delamination life of a ceramics-coating in the specimen with a low-pressure-plasma-sprayed (LPPS) bond-coating was found to be longer than that with an atmospheric-plasma-sprayed (APS) bond-coating. The large roughness of a bond-coating was also found to be effective in improving the delamination life of a ceramics-coating owing to the <b>restriction</b> of a <b>crack</b> propagation parallel to the interface between the ceramics-coating and the bond-coating...|$|R
40|$|The fivefold {{symmetric}} {{modular stellarator}} Wendelstein 7 -X (W 7 -X) is currently {{under construction in}} Greifswald, Germany. The superconducting coils of the magnet system are bolted onto a central support ring and interconnected with five so-called lateral support elements (LSEs) per half module. After welding of the LSE hollow boxes to the coil cases, cracks {{were found in the}} vicinity of the welds that could potentially limit the allowed number N of electromagnetic (EM) load cycles of the machine. In response to the appearance of first cracks during assembly, the Stress Intensity Factors (SIFs) were calculated and corresponding crack growth rates of theoretical semi-circular cracks of measured sizes in potentially critical position and orientation were predicted using Paris’ law, whose parameters were calibrated in fatigue tests at cryogenic temperature. In this paper the Dual Boundary Element Method (DBEM) is applied in a coupled FEM-DBEM approach to analyze the propagation of multiple cracks with different shapes. For this purpose, the crack path is assessed with the Minimum Strain Energy density criterion and SIFs are calculated by the Jintegral approach. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is adopted to model, using the commercial codes Ansys or Abaqus;, the overall component whereas the submodel analysis, in the volume surrounding the cracked area, is performed by FEM (“FEM-FEM approach”) or alternatively by DBEM (“FEM-DBEM approach”). The “FEM-FEM approach” considers a FEM submodel, that is extracted from the FEM global model; the latter provide the boundary conditions for the submodel. Such approach is affected by some <b>restrictions</b> in the <b>crack</b> propagation phase, whereas, with the “FEM-DBEM approach”, the crack propagation simulation is straightforward. In this case the submodel is created in a DBEM environment with boundary conditions provided by the global FEM analysis; then the crack is introduced and a crack propagation analysis has been performed to evaluate the effects of the crack shape and of the presence of nearby cracks on the allowed number of EM load cycles...|$|R
40|$|The {{stress and}} {{fracture}} analysis of multilayered materials and structures containing crack-like defects {{is of interest}} in many research areas, such as composites, bio-mechanics, and geomechanics, and engineering applications, such as coatings, electronics, and adhesive joints. The main objective of this thesis is to further develop a general methodology and utilise it for the examination of fracture problems in multilayered materials. The general methodology {{is based upon the}} distributed dislocation technique and edge dislocation solutions obtained within the framework of plane theory of linear elasticity. This methodology has been shaped by the seminal contributions of many researchers over the past fifty years and currently represents a powerful tool for the analysis of crack problems. New theoretical models and techniques are developed in the present thesis for a range of multi-disciplinary problems utilising the adopted methodology. The research gaps and objectives are formulated specifically for each problem and discussed in separate chapters of this thesis. The solution of each of these problems represents an original and substantial contribution towards the respective area of research. The significant outcomes of this thesis include: a new approach for the analysis of reinforced cracks in layered media, a new mechanism for height control of hydraulic fractures in layered hydrocarbon reservoirs, and a new predictive model for skier-triggered avalanches. The original contributions of this thesis also include a new fundamental solution for an interfacial edge dislocation, which recovers all previously published solutions for edge dislocations in isotropic multilayered media. The obtained solution can be utilised to derive the governing integral equations {{for a wide variety of}} quasi-static crack problems in linearly elastic and isotropic multilayered materials, without any <b>restrictions</b> on the <b>crack</b> orientation or number of elastic layers. Therefore, the newly obtained solution further extends the general methodology to effectively solve a wide class of fracture problems in multilayered materials and structures. This thesis is presented in the form of a compendium of publications in high impact specialist journals. The main body of the thesis contains four articles which are united by the above mentioned theme and methodology. Three appendices are also included, which represent a compilation of the candidate’s publications on related topics. A complete publication list is provided in the forthcoming pages. Thesis (Ph. D.)
