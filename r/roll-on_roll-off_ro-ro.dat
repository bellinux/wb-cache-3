2500|$|In September 2008, an {{independent}} {{review of the}} safety and functionality of the ship revealed that some operating limitations {{will have to be}} accepted, as sea-keeping performance is poor in high sea states. The [...] "selection of a commercial <b>Roll-on,</b> <b>Roll-off</b> (<b>Ro-Ro)</b> design" [...] has [...] "been at the root of differences of opinion between Tenix, the Ministry of Defence and New Zealand Defence Force and the shortfalls in performance". The issues included that the propellers can come out of the water when the ship pitches in rough seas, with concern that this may affect the ship's machinery. The report also recommended relocating the ship's boats (or protecting them from waves if relocation was not possible) and adding more ballast or improving the ballasting system of Canterbury.|$|E

50|$|The next ferry, {{also named}} Bastø, was {{delivered}} in 1934 with {{a capacity of}} 400 passengers and 18 cars. It soon became too small, setting a new record of 210 cars in one day in 1937. From 1934 to 1936 the annual number of cars rose from 6,605 to 10,143. To get more capacity another Bastø II was delivered in 1939 from Moss Værft og Dokk, capable of holding 600 passengers and 34 cars. This ferry was the first <b>roll-on</b> <b>roll-off</b> (<b>ro-ro)</b> ferry on the route, with car access from a specially built quay. On 9 April 1940 the ferry continued its ordinary traffic in the stream of German warships, which were coming into the fjord to occupy Norway. During World War II six of the companies seven ships were {{taken over by the}} German Forces.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{tactical}} maritime fleet deployment problem in <b>roll-on</b> <b>roll-off</b> (<b>ro-ro)</b> liner shipping scenario, {{which deals with}} optimally assigning planned voyages to the available vessels in a fleet to determine the routing and scheduling of vessels across the given trade routes, {{in order to maximize}} profit or minimize cost. This paper presents a new model for a fleet deployment problem in liner shipping that considers inventory constraints at ports for vendor managed cargo in each route and determines optimal shipment sizes for those cargoes, between corresponding origin and destination ports. We present an MILP formulation for the problem described above, a scheme to generate appropriate datasets, and computational results for the problem...|$|E

40|$|Regular {{maritime}} {{lines with}} <b>roll-on</b> <b>roll-off</b> vessels must offer a reliable service without substantial cost increases {{in order to}} be competitive. Port terminals {{need to be able to}} respond quickly to any disturbance that might appear and return to a smooth operational state in the minimum amount of time (resilient terminals). In this paper a complete taxonomy of the disturbances affecting the operational processes in a <b>roll-on</b> <b>roll-off</b> terminal is introduced together with a system able to assess the performance of any measure used to mitigate them. The study is based on an overview of the existing literature on the topic, a detailed diagram of the operational processes of the terminal, and an exhaustive set of interviews of the staff involved in the processes occurring in a <b>roll-on</b> <b>roll-off</b> terminal, together with field measurements. The main vulnerabilities are identified and possible corrective and preventive measures are pointed out. Postprint (published version...|$|R
