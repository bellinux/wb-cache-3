R. S. Yeoman's 2014 edition of A Guide Book of United States Coins lists no Seated Liberty dollar in collectable condition (very good or better) at less than $280.|$|R

40|$|<b>For</b> too long, <b>size</b> {{perception}} {{research has}} been guided by the size distance invariance hypothesis. Although research to validate this hypothesis has been largely inconclusive, the hypothesis has endured, perhaps in part because alternative information sources <b>for</b> <b>size</b> perception were lacking. Here, I propose a binocular information source <b>for</b> <b>size</b> perception. The model, drawing on the binocular geometry of viewing a physical extent, is expressed solely in terms of four angular measures and interocular distance, with the explicit exclusion of egocentric distance information. Thus, the proposed information source, if utilized by the binocular system, {{should be able to}} augment the few existing sources of information <b>for</b> <b>size</b> perception (e. g., familiar size, texture gradient, and horizon ratio) ...|$|R

30|$|Conventional methodologies (empirical, analytical, numerical, hybrid, etc.) {{are used}} <b>for</b> <b>sizing</b> {{photovoltaic}} (PV) systems, {{especially when the}} required weather data (irradiance, temperature, humidity, clearness index, wind speed, etc.) and the information concerning the location of PV system are available [1, 2, 3, 4]. These methods present a good solution <b>for</b> <b>sizing</b> PV systems under the above conditions. However, such techniques cannot be used <b>for</b> <b>sizing</b> PV systems where the required data are not available. Moreover, {{the majority of the}} above methods need long-term meteorological data, such as total solar irradiance, air temperature, and wind speed, for their operations. To overcome this situation, newer methods have been developed <b>for</b> <b>sizing</b> the parameters <b>for</b> PV systems based on artificial intelligence techniques [5]. However, these methods require complex implementation and powerful calculators to reduce time calculation which makes simple methods, like worst month method, still largely used in sizing simple remote PV systems.|$|R
