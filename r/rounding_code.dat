40|$|The authors {{analyze the}} new Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) that was {{negotiated}} between {{a subset of}} General Agreement on Tariffs an Trade (GATT) members in the Uruguay Round, focusing especially on the expansion of coverage to services and on the strengthening of enforcement mechanisms. Coverage objective were substantially achieved, although commitments containmany exceptions for services. The transparency of signatories'procurement practices was enhanced and enforcement provisions were strengthened, particularly {{by the introduction of}} a bid-protest challenge mechanism, which allows private parties (firms) to invoke the Agreement before national courts. (A potential problem: domestic courts could produce divergent interpretations of the GPA). Unlike most of the other Tokyo <b>Round</b> <b>codes</b> - for example, the agreements on technical barriers to trade (standards), import licensing, customs valuation, subsidies, and antidumping - the GPA could not be"multilateralized. "Its disciplines apply only to World Trade Organization (WTO) members that have signed it. Public procurement represents a major source of demand for goods and services in most countries. Getting domestic procurement policies"right"can therefore have major effects on welfare. And improving developing countries'access to global procurement markets could help induce governments to adopt multilateral rules, if those could be shown to be in their interests. The authors explore why {{only a limited number of}} countries have signed the GPA. They suggest the pursuit of tariffication as one avenue through which the Agreement might be expanded to cover all WTO members. In the process, the GPA could be improved economically by eliminating current provisions that allow for measures with quota-like effects, and by weakening incentives to seek"absolute"sector-by-sector reciprocity.

Thus, using the proposed codes instead of classical binary codes such as Walsh codes results in slight increase of complexity of the system, mainly at the receiver side where sequence matched filtering will involve multiplications instead of sign shifts of sampled received signals. Although chip amplitude of balanced codes can have continuous values, in practical systems they should be rounded to remain in some discrete alphabet and thus facilitate digital processing. We have checked that 8 bits encoding of the chips of balanced codes is enough to avoid BER performance degradation for codes of length 32 and codes of length 256.

40|$|Abstract Background Although {{reproducibility}} {{in reading}} MRI images amongst radiologists and clinicians {{has been studied}} previously, no {{studies have examined the}} reproducibility of inexperienced clinicians in extracting pathoanatomic information from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) narrative reports and transforming that information into quantitative data. However, this process is frequently required in research and quality assurance contexts. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine inter-rater reproducibility (agreement and reliability) among an inexperienced group of clinicians in extracting spinal pathoanatomic information from radiologist-generated MRI narrative reports. Methods Twenty MRI narrative reports were randomly extracted from an institutional database. A group of three physiotherapy students independently reviewed the reports and coded the presence of 14 common pathoanatomic findings using a categorical electronic coding matrix. Decision rules were developed after initial coding in an effort to resolve ambiguities in narrative reports. This process was repeated a further three times using separate samples of 20 MRI reports until no further ambiguities were identified (total n = 80). Reproducibility between trainee clinicians and two highly trained raters was examined in an arbitrary <b>coding</b> <b>round,</b> with agreement measured using percentage agreement and reliability measured using unweighted Kappa (k). Reproducibility was then examined in another group of three trainee clinicians who had not participated in the production of the decision rules, using another sample of 20 MRI reports. Results The mean percentage agreement for paired comparisons between the initial trainee clinicians improved over the four <b>coding</b> <b>rounds</b> (97. 9 - 99. 4 %), although the greatest improvement was observed after the first introduction of coding rules. High inter-rater reproducibility was observed between trainee clinicians across 14 pathoanatomic categories over the four <b>coding</b> <b>rounds</b> (agreement range: 80. 8 - 100 %; reliability range k = 0. 63 - 1. 00). Concurrent validity was high in paired comparisons between trainee clinicians and highly trained raters (agreement 97. 8 - 98. 1 %, reliability k = 0. 83 - 0. 91). Reproducibility was also high in the second sample of trainee clinicians (inter-rater agreement 96. 7 - 100. 0 % and reliability k = 0. 76 - 1. 00; intra-rater agreement 94. 3 - 100. 0 % and reliability k = 0. 61 - 1. 00). Conclusions A high level of radiological training is not required in order to transform MRI-derived pathoanatomic information from a narrative format to a quantitative format with high reproducibility for research or quality assurance purposes. </p...|$|R
30|$|The {{development}} of new techniques has, however, now reached {{the point at which}} some of the newly designed experiments cannot be tested operationally at EISCAT, given the limitations of the current EISCAT hardware, though they have been tested elsewhere (e.g. Virtanen et al. 2013). For example, the work on polyphase codes, exploring how additional degrees of freedom can be opened up by the control of the transmitted polarisation to levels of polarisation change less than 180 °, cannot be exploited because the current EISCAT transmitters are not capable of the required phase control. In addition, the use of amplitude modulation in EISCAT coding, which has been extensively studied by the Finnish EISCAT user community, cannot be implemented in practice because the present transmitter exciters are not capable of the required amplitude control. These limitations will not exist in EISCAT_ 3 D, for which the transmitter is being designed not only to be sufficiently flexible to transmit all of the coding strategies which have so far been devised by the EISCAT community, but also to accommodate the next <b>round</b> of <b>coding</b> developments anticipated during the coming years.|$|R
30|$|The general {{procedure}} for performing the {{content analysis of}} annual reports is outlined below: the principal investigator and the research assistant performed the content analysis. Prior to the coding process, the research assistant was given a detailed briefing on what constitutes a CSR disclosure, {{the use of the}} coding instrument and an explanation of the different categories and types of disclosure. During the briefing session, the principal investigator used several different annual reports that were not part of the actual sample used for the study to highlight different types of disclosures. At the end of the session, the research assistant was then handed a few annual reports to attempt the coding. Upon completion of this preliminary <b>round</b> of <b>coding,</b> the principal investigator reviewed the coding and categorisations performed by the research assistant. The principal investigator addressed specific issues in coding raised by the research assistant. Following this initial round, the research assistant and the principal investigator both were involved in the coding process of the annual reports and discussed any ambiguity of the items of disclosure, which were reviewed and resolved. This was carried out to ensure consistency and reliability in the content analysis procedure.|$|R
30|$|Even {{with these}} coding rules, the biggest {{challenge}} was to ensure the consistent application of the codes throughout the database, particularly because the same code can have different meanings across languages and in different national contexts. For instance, although all points-based systems attribute points to specific migrant characteristics and all recruitment programmes imply state involvement, in practice the codes can reflect very different selection systems. No matter how detailed and objective the coding system and the definitions of the respective codes are, the actual coding exercise always involves interpretation, which creates potential biases. The elaborate DEMIG POLICY coding system, which was gradually developed through extensive internal discussions and several test <b>coding</b> <b>rounds,</b> served to minimize such biases and to maximize consistency.|$|R

Laws to govern "unfair " trading practices were put into place in the United States [US], early in the twentieth century, to deal with predatory pricing by foreign firms (antidumping [AD] law) and government subsidized foreign competition (countervailing duty [CVD] law).

40|$|International trade {{relations}} between {{developed and developing}} countries have been accommodated by means of multilateral trade negotiations. These negotiations ensured the birth of GATT in 1948. GATT has eight rounds of trade negotiations. The last one is the Uruguay Round (1986 - 1994). The principle of reciprocity of obligation (MFN) is well established in these trade rounds, {{as it is a}} central principle in traditional international trade law. This principle has negative effect on developing countriesand prejudice their interests. Developing countries made claims against this classical concept. They argued that the {{trade relations}}need a remedy to ensure their development and trade needs. A suitable solution to this critical issue is to grant special status and treatmentto countries at lower stages of development. This thesis contains five chapters. The method adopted in it is a historical, analytical and a critical approach. Chapter one deals with Uruguay Round and the establishment of WTO as a result of multilateral trade negotiations. It gives a historical background to all rounds before Uruguay Round. The study goes further to explain issues dealt with during the Uruguay Round. These include trade in goods, services and IPRs. The chapter also defines WTO and deals with categorization of WTO members. WTO recognizes four groups of members: developed, developing, least- developed countries and transitional economics. However, it defines one category (LDCs) as it is recognized by UN system. Moreover, the chapter deals with the notion of special and differential treatment in international trade law as an exception to the general rule of reciprocity. It explains developing countries’ efforts to express their views and legitimize their development and trade needs through the concept of special and differential treatment. These efforts institutionalized the concept in a number of amendments and decisions to the original GATT. WTO Agreements contain also about 145 provisions. Chapter two deals with special and differential treatment in pre- Uruguay Round. The main fields thathad this principle are Articles XVIII, Part IV, Tokyo <b>Rounds</b> <b>Codes</b> and the enabling clause. Chapter three explains the main provisions on special and differential treatment in WTO Agreements. They include provisions to enhance opportunities for developing countries to access markets of developed countries; safeguard developing countries’ interests by adopting national or international measures; provide longer transitional periods; and grant technical and financial assistance. Chapter four explains implementation of provisions on special and differential treatment. It focuses on difficulties that faced developing countries and prevented them from gaining the benefits of special and differential treatment under WTO Agreements.
