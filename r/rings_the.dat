5|$|In Time Trials, {{the player}} can freely race {{on a course}} to perform the best times, which are {{recorded}} in the game's data. In the Stunt Mode, the player must earn points by executing stunts and passing through <b>rings.</b> <b>The</b> points depend upon how many <b>rings</b> <b>the</b> player passes through without missing, {{as well as the}} class of stunt that has been performed. The multiplayer mode uses a horizontal split-screen and allows two players to compete against each other on a chosen course. Only the courses that have been unlocked in the Championship mode can be played in the Time Trials, Stunt, and multiplayer modes. The game offers four personalized racers for players to select from, each having their own strengths and weaknesses. A Nintendo 64 Controller Pak can be used to transfer saved data from one game cartridge to another.|$|E

5|$|The inner moons {{are closely}} {{associated}} with Neptune's <b>rings.</b> <b>The</b> two innermost satellites, Naiad and Thalassa, orbit between the Galle and LeVerrier rings. Despina may be a shepherd moon of the LeVerrier ring, because its orbit lies just inside this ring. The next moon, Galatea, orbits just inside {{the most prominent of}} Neptune's <b>rings,</b> <b>the</b> Adams ring. This ring is very narrow, with a width not exceeding 50km, and has five embedded bright arcs. The gravity of Galatea helps confine the ring particles within a limited region in the radial direction, maintaining the narrow ring. Various resonances between the ring particles and Galatea may also have a role in maintaining the arcs.|$|E

The mushroom fruits in the fall from September to October throughout much of its range, but in California the fruiting season tends to be from November to February.|$|E
5|$|Adventure 2 has 180 emblems, earned for {{a variety}} of tasks. Each level has five missions; only the first is {{required}} to continue the campaign, and other missions include completing a harder version of a level and collecting 100 <b>rings.</b> <b>The</b> player earns emblems by completing missions and other tasks, many related to Chao raising. Collecting all the emblems unlocks a 3D version of the Green Hill Zone stage from the original Sonic the Hedgehog.|$|E
5|$|An {{original}} non-canon story {{set in the}} legendarium {{created by}} J. R. R. Tolkien, the game takes place between the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the <b>Rings.</b> <b>The</b> player controls Talion, a Ranger who bonds with the wraith of the Elf Lord Celebrimbor, as the two set out to avenge {{the deaths of the}}ir loved ones. Players can engage in melee combat, and use wraith abilities to fight and manipulate enemies. The game introduces the Nemesis System, which allows the artificial intelligence of non-playable characters to remember the deaths of the game's protagonist and react accordingly.|$|E

5|$|Burst {{frequency}} offset (BFO) – The {{difference between the}} expected and received frequency of transmissions. The difference is caused by doppler shift as the signals travelled from the aircraft to the satellite to the ground station; the frequency translations made in the satellite and at the ground station; a small, constant error (bias) in the SDU that results from drift and ageing; and compensation applied by the SDU to counter the Doppler shift on the uplink. This measure can be analysed to determine where along the BTO <b>rings</b> <b>the</b> aircraft was located.|$|E

5|$|His first {{project for}} Webb and Knapp was an {{apartment}} building with funding from the Housing Act of 1949.

Zeckendorf loved the design and even showed it off to Le Corbusier when they met. The cost of such an unusual design was too high, however, and the building never moved beyond the model stage.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the flag of Artsakh, the Armenian flag colors influenced {{the design of the}} Pan-Armenian Games flag. In the center of the light blue flag are six interlocking rings, derived from the Olympic <b>rings.</b> <b>The</b> sixth, orange-colored ring, interlocks with the blue and red rings, which symbolize Armenia.

5|$|Similar {{to single}} interstitials, divacancies {{do not produce}} photoluminescence.

Annealing of vacancies changes diamond color from green to yellow-brown. Similar mechanism (vacancy aggregation) is also believed to cause brown color of plastically deformed natural diamonds.|$|E

Godfrey was Fleming's superior officer in Naval Intelligence Division {{during the war and}} was known for his bellicose and irascible temperament. During their Christmas lunch, M tells Bond of an old naval acquaintance, a Chief Gunnery Officer named McLachlan. This was actually an old colleague of both Godfrey and Fleming's in the NID, Donald McLachlan.|$|E
5|$|The game {{contains}} {{two types of}} bonus stages accessed by passing a checkpoint with at least 20 <b>rings.</b> <b>The</b> first type has Sonic or Knuckles orbit floating, glowing spheres, jetting off each one when a button is pressed, while a fence of light approaches from the bottom and will remove the player from the stage if touched.
