5|$|However, the Americans {{were not}} {{counting}} on Thảo {{and his fellow}} Catholic Phát trying to seize power on an explicitly religious platform, claiming fidelity to slain former Catholic President Ngô Đình Diệm and promising to recall Khiêm from the US to lead the new regime. This caused alarm among the Buddhist majority, who had campaigned heavily against Diệm's discriminatory religious policies {{in the months leading}} up to his ouster in November 1963. Although they wanted Khánh gone, the Americans did not want Thảo and Phát to succeed, so they sought out Kỳ and Thi in an attempt to have them defeat the original coup and then depose Khánh. During the initial attack, Thảo and Phát tried to capture both Khánh and Kỳ, but both men escaped narrowly, although some of their colleagues in the Armed Forces Council were arrested. Although the rebels were able to take control of Tan Son Nhut Air Base, the largest in the country and the military headquarters of South Vietnam, Kỳ was able to regroup quickly and retain control of the nearby Bien Hoa Air Base, using it to mobilize air power and stop the rebel advance with threats of bombing. Late in the night, Thảo and Phát met Kỳ in a meeting arranged by the Americans, where an agreement was <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> coup to be ended in return for Khánh's ouster. By early next morning, the bloodless military action was over as Thảo and Phát went into hiding, and the junta voted to sack their leader Khánh, who was absent on a military inspection tour, thinking that Kỳ and Thi were on his side.|$|E

25|$|The idea of {{coalition}} government {{came when the}} PPP and the PML-N won the biggest seats in the 300-seat Parliament of Pakistan, the elections were set to be held on 8 January 2008 but were postponed until 18 February 2008 due to the assassination of former Pakistani PM Benazir Bhutto, after the elections were conducted in a peaceful manner, within the country of Pakistan, and the overall {{results showed that the}} PPP had won 93 seats with the PML-N winning 70 seats, and in total winning a number of 163 seats, and has the majority of the seats. After widespread speculation of the two parties forming a coalition government, it was finally announced on 30 February 2008, 18 days after the elections, that both parties were discussing a coalition government.

25|$|Early spring can {{be quite}} cold, and {{occasionally}} the lowest temperatures of the year can occur in March, as it did at Heathrow Airport on 5 March 2001, 4 March 2006 and 8 March 2011. Temperatures below freezing are not unusual in March, even {{in the south of}} the UK. On the other hand, high temperatures above 30°C are generally rare but can occur on occasion; most recently on 25 May 2012. It was even hotter on 27 May 2005, when 31.9°C was recorded in London. Rarely, the hottest day of the year can be in spring. As stated below, 27 May was the hottest day of the year in 2012 {{in most parts of the}} UK. In Aberdaron, the hottest day of 2011 was very early on in the year on 21 April. Temperatures in March seldom reach 20°C, as they did in 1990, 1993, 2012 and 2017, and this temperature is usually <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time in April or May. Throughout spring, there can be very dramatic temperature swings between day night. On 9 April 2017, night-time temperatures fell to just 3°C at Northolt, but 25°C was reached in the afternoon. Warmth in Spring depends almost entirely on the strength of the sun, and can trigger thunderstorms and downpours.|$|E
