40|$|Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), the White Gold, {{occupies}} a pivotal position in Pakistanâ€™s economy {{as it is}} the major source of raw material for textile industry in the country. Currently, cotton crop is facing a number of restraints, resulting in low yield per ha. Some of the constraints include costly agricultural inputs (seed, fertilizers, pesticides etc), pest attack, lack of pest and disease resistant varieties, good quality seed, scarcity of irrigation water, improper cultivation method and unavailability of advanced technologies. The research was conducted at the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan, to explore the response of cotton to tillage, irrigation and sowing methods. The aim of the experiment was to assess most suitable and economical tillage system and planting method for cotton crop, to attain efficient irrigation water utilization and saving without affecting crop yield or quality and to quantify the irrigation water for cotton crop required for different planting methods. Keeping in view, two different experiments were conducted for two consecutive years. First experiment comprised of two tillage systems i. e., conventional tillage (one time disc harrow + two cultivations + planking) and deep tillage (chiselling twice + one cultivation + planking) and three sowing methods viz; flat sowing, <b>ridge</b> <b>sowing,</b> and bed sowing. The second experiment comprised of two irrigation levels (50 % field capacity and 75 % field capacity) along with three different sowing methods (flat sowing, <b>ridge</b> <b>sowing,</b> and bed sowing). Replicated three times, both experiments were laid out in split plot design randomizing tillage systems in main plots and sowing methods in sub-plots in experiment I while in experiment II irrigation levels were randomized in main plots and sowing methods in sub-plots maintaining a net plot size of 6. 0 m Ã— 9. 0 m. Bt cotton variety AA- 703 was sown at 75 cm spaced rows using 20 kg seed rate ha- 1. Data pertaining to growth and yield parameters were recorded and analysed statistically. In first experiment, higher root length was recorded at deep tillage than conventional tillage during both the years of the study. Deep tillage gave maximum leaf area index (LAI) and total dry matter (TDM) showing increase in seed cotton yield of 18. 72 % in 2010 and 11. 14 % in 2011. Bed sowing produced 8. 8 % higher yield than <b>ridge</b> <b>sowing</b> in 2010 and 4. 12 % higher during 2011 and 25. 61 and 16. 47 % higher than flat sowing respectively. Deep tillage with bed sowing gave maximum net returns of Rs. 121556 /- with benefit cost ratio (BCR) of 1. 81 in year 2010, while in 2011 it was Rs. 68627 /- with BCR 1. 45. In second experiment, application of irrigation at 75 % field capacity (FC) significantly increased LAI, crop growth rate (CGR), net assimilation rate (NAR) and TDM over 50 % FC in 2010 and similar trend was also observed in 2011. Water applied at 75 % FC enhanced 38 % yield during 2010 and 30. 49 % in 2011 than 50 % FC. Bed sowing produced 12. 1 % and 18. 09 % (in 2010) and 6. 08 and 19 % (in 2011) higher yield than <b>ridge</b> <b>sowing</b> and flat sowing, respectively. Irrigation level of 75 % FC with bed sowing gave maximum net return of Rs. 82574 /- with BCR of 1. 54 in 2010, while Rs. 43336 /- with BCR 1. 28 in 2011...|$|E

Increasingly serious water and temperature {{issues associated with}} global climate change may be problematic in the future, particularly in semiarid regions. This study explored the soil water and crop yield benefits of switching the sowing location of corn from ridges to furrows. Experiments were conducted over three years.

40|$|Cool, wet spring weather often delays {{the early}} growth of carrots (Daucus carota L.) in {{northern}} Europe. This effect may be partly obviated by <b>sowing</b> in <b>ridges.</b> Many types of ridges are used, {{but the most}} suitable for carrot cultivation under the conditions prevailing in northern Europe {{has yet to be}} determined. The effects of ridging, seeding rate and sowing system on the yield and visible quality of carrots were therefore studied in the field during three years. The highest yields were recorded for carrots sown in double rows on a narrow ridge. The effect of sowing system on mean root weight differed depending on the ridging regime. The mean weight of roots was higher for carrots cultivated on broad ridges than in other systems. Seeding rate had the most significant effect on mean root weight. For industrial purposes it is recommended that carrots be cultivated on broad ridges in double rows at low seeding rates with irrigation. The optimal cultivation technique for carrots destined for the fresh vegetable market would be narrow <b>ridges</b> <b>sown</b> in double rows at high seeding rates. The ridging system, seeding rate and row spacing did not appear to affect the external quality of roots.

40|$|A new {{variety of}} millet {{developed}} by Burkina Faso s agricultural research institute, l Institut national pour l étude et la recherche agronomique (INERA), is proving {{a big hit}} with farmers in the central southern region of the country. The IKMP 5 variety, nicknamed Kiipala (new millet) by local farmers, is popular because it ripens more quickly than the traditional variety and has greater resistance to drought. Kyelem Benjamin, a research technician at INERA, says it has a 70 -day cycle, almost half that of traditional millet. Farmers can therefore sow later, enabling them to manage their agricultural timetable more efficiently and {{to cut down on}} their workload. This means they have more time to devote to other activities such as growing maize, peanuts and cowpeas. In the words of one farmer, Souleymane Ouédraogo: With the improved variety, you have to plough and make <b>ridges,</b> <b>sow,</b> weed and earth up, while with the traditional variety {{you have to go back}} five or six times for weeding. Farmers are also enthusiastic about the flavour of the improved variety. It is easier to chew and much sweeter, so much so that it can be used to make zoom koom, a local drink based on millet flour, without adding sugar. Producers claim dishes made from this new variety are more appetising, since the millet is less yellow than the traditional version. The new variety was introduced in the country s Toessé department 2 years ago. Mr. Benjamin stresses that it requires more technical precision, i. e. a distance of 80 cm must be left between each row and 40 cm between each plant. Some farmers are so keen on the new millet that they maintain it produces higher yields, a claim that is denied by the INERA researcher traditional millet and the improved variety produce identical yields if grown in the same conditions. By contrast, he says, IKMP 5 is more resistant to mildew, the scourge of millet. Photographics credits: © IPGRI, © TDAU, © MPA, M. Malengrez © InfoSud, © Meantime Brewery, © Syfia International.

5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{farming methods}} of the Matengo are known as Ingolo or Ngolo. Over the last 100 years, the Matengo have developed an innovative method of farming on the steep hills, digging pits on ridges on steep slopes to prevent soil erosion and to promote sustainable fertile soils. The function of the pits is to prevent heavy rain washing away the soils on the steep slopes, acting as sedimentation tanks to trap green grasses, thus providing a source of nutrients for the following season. The main crops they grow are staple food crops and coffee under this unique system of cultivation known as [...] "Matengo Pit Cultivation". This cultivation practice usually starts in March following the rainy season. Their method involves a 2-year one-cycle rotation of crops, with a short-fallow period, generally maize, beans and peas. For example, with maize farming amongst the Matengo, in November a farmer will make furrows of roughly 5 centimetres on the <b>ridges</b> and <b>sow</b> the seeds, and commence weeding in December. The maize is then harvested in July and then the field is reduced to fallow until the following March to allow the soils to recover. If the planting of beans is delayed, cassava is often planted in the April or May. Often, the fields may only contain cassava which is known to the Matengo as [...] "kibagu" [...] and is generally grown for 2-3 years. Like sweet potato, cassava is often grown to increase food supply during bad harvests. It is common for fields to contain a mix of maize and beans {{and to a lesser}} extent cassava. Unlike maize, the beans are harvested earlier in the season in the March. Some are also known to cultivate onions, cabbage, Chinese cabbage and tomato.|$|R

An experiment was conducted for 2 years in Central Greece to evaluate two alternative systems. The experiment {{was carried out in}} a Vertic Cambisol and a Typic Regosol field. Cultivation practices tested were: (1) conventional tillage (CT) and sowing in a flat field, (2) ridge tillage (RT), using autumn <b>ridging</b> and (3) <b>sowing</b> in a flat field under clear plastic film (PF). Early and normal sowings were compared. The effects of the treatment on the crop establishment, growth and yield, {{as well as on the}} soil physical properties, were studied. Performance evaluation of the machinery was carried Out. The cost of cultivation practices was estimated. Results of soil physical properties were similar for both years. Soil water contents from sowing to plastic removal in 2000 were 14. 2, 13. 5 and 18. 0 g/ 100 g and temperatures for the same period at 0. 04 m depth were 17. 7, 18. 1 and 19. 8 degrees C for CT, RT and PF, respectively. PF resulted in higher emergence and higher plants with smaller roots. Average yields of seed-cotton in early sowing were 4936, 4591 and 4033 kg/ha for PF, RT and CT, respectively. In late sowing yields in RT and in CT did not differ significantly. Ridge tillage machinery saved 13. 6 kWh/ha (20. 9 %) compared to conventional tillage machinery. The higher yields under plastic film compensated for the higher cost of the practice at the present prices of seed-cotton. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) is a crop {{of great}} antiquity and {{probably}} one of the oldest oilseeds under cultivation. No records on sesame outdate those of Babylon in Sumeria where it was known in 2350 B. C. At present the crop is grown in many tropical and subtropical countries, among which India, China, Mexico, the Sudan and Venezuela rank first in production. Since 1967 most published research has been carried out in India and Venezuela. The total world production which varies considorably from year to year, has shown since 1950 / 1951 no consistent trend of increase or decrease. It amounted to about 1. 8 million ton both in 1950 / 1951 and 1969 / 1970. Approximately 10 per cent of the production moves into international trade. In Nigeria purchases of sesame seed by the Marketing Board arrived at 17, 459 ton in 1969 / 1970 and 5, 714 ton in 1970 / 1971. The export is mainly directed towards Italy. Sesame seed contains about 50 Per cent oil and 20 per cent protein, it is a popular constituent of various local dishes and is highly regarded because of the good quality of its oil. The crop is well established in parts of four province- of the Northern States of Nigeria. The production areas are characterised by their location between latitudes 6 ° and 10 °, a duration of the dry season of about 4 to 5 months, an annual rainfall of about 1, 000 - 1, 500 mm, a vegetation of rather open savannah woodland and a top soil of loamy sand. The cultivation and crop handling follow traditional patterns and the use of machinery is uncommon. Most of the experimental work reported here has been carried out at the Agricultural Research Station, Mokwa, Nigeria. Section 4 deals with spacing and density experiments. Ways of sowing vary in the different production areas of Nigeria but basically two methods can be distinguished. (a) The Igbirra method, characterised by <b>sowing</b> on <b>ridges</b> about 4 m apart at a spacing of 45 cm between the stands and with about 16 plants per stand, and (b) the Tiv method, which involves broadcasting,rarely followed by thinning; plant counts per unit area showed considerable variation, the mean plant density value being calculated as 673, 000 plants per ha. In view of soil and water conservation, <b>sowing</b> on <b>ridges</b> has been a recommended practice in Nigeria for a long time, the distance between the ridges usually being 91 cm. The experimental results under such conditions were interpreted as to give an optimum for a spacing of about 6 cm. on the <b>ridges.</b> <b>Sowing</b> on the flat in 1971 produced a maximum-yield at a spacing of about 22 x 13 cm. In this case a formula derived from Bleasdale and Nelder (1960) was found to describe well the relation between spacing and yield. In both methods, described under (a) and (b) there is room for improvement. In Nigeria. it is common experience that for a good number of crops early sowing, immediately after the onset of the rains, results in maximum yields and delay of sowing causes yield reduction. Factors thought to affect sowing date differences and their consequences for crop growth and yield, were, daylength changes, leaching of nitrogen, capping of the soil caused by hard rain, saturation of the soil with water, and differences in light intensity, disease and post incidence and temperature during the growing season. The data in section 5 provide a quantitative evaluation of the effect of sowing date on growth and yield of sesame. They indicate that the first four factors mentioned cannot explain the typical "sowing date delay effect. " However, changes in light intensity, disease incidence and possibly temperature during the season influence the relation between sowing date and crop growth. Most of the common sesame cultivars are characterised by opening or dehiscent capsules. This capsule character has the advantage that it simplifies threshing, but the disadvantage that it increases seed loss. The discovery in 1943 of the indehiscence character in Venezuela by Langham was of great significance, as it enabled increased mechanisation of sesame production, and was expected to reduce seed loss. However, the results of experiments described in section 6 showed that losses caused by shattering of seed from opening capsules is less than visually estimated, and that seed loss need not exceed 2 per cent if a good harvesting method is applied (Fence B). It is concluded that the character of indehiscent capsules will become of value only when combines can be employed economically at harvest. Picking or stripping of capsules appeared to be a method of no practical value. Section 7 mentions the main diseases and pests of sesame and deals in more detail with a virus, disease called leaf-curl. Attempts to transmit the disease with plant sap and with seed failed but white flies were observed to act as vectors of leaf-curl. The damage caused by the disease can be disastrous and it embodies an actual or potential threat to sesame cultivation in Nigeria. Sowing date trials showed that delay of sowing after the onset of the rains increases infection and that the disease incidence decreases when sowing is postponed till after the middle of July. Sowing after the middle of August results in disease-free crops. The magnitude of the white fly population, as estimated by counts on yellow, sticky traps, was not always a reliable indicator for the extent of disease infection. Resistance to leaf-curl was correlated with hairiness in an F 4 bulk population, but occurred also in glabrous plants and reduced the disease damage considerably. ...|$|R

The experiment was {{laid out in a}} randomized block design with combination of 2 sowing methods (flat sowing, 75 [*]cm apart rows, and <b>ridge</b> <b>sowing,</b> 75 [*]cm apart ridges) and 3 fertility levels (60 [*]:[*] 40 [*]:[*] 20, 75 [*]:[*] 50 [*]:[*] 30, and 90 [*]:[*] 60 [*]:[*] 40 N[*]:[*]P 2 O 5 [*]:[*]K 2 O[*]kg[*]ha− 1) with three replications. Various growth characters, namely, plant height, leaf area index, dry matter accumulation, number of days to different phenological stages, and yield, and yield contributing characters namely, cob length, number of grains cob− 1, cob diameter (cm), and 100 -seed weight (g), were significantly higher with S 2 over S 1 during both the years of experimentation. Fertilizer levels F 3 (90 [*]:[*] 60 [*]:[*] 40) and F 2 (75 [*]:[*] 50 [*]:[*] 30) at par with one another produced significant increase in growth and yield characters, namely, plant height, leaf area index, dry matter production at different growth stages, cob length, number of cobs plant− 1, number of grains cob− 1, and 100 -seed weight over F 1 (60 [*]:[*] 40 [*]:[*] 20). Significantly higher grain yield was recorded with fertilizer level F 3 (90 [*]:[*] 60 [*]:[*] 40) being at par with F 2 (75 [*]:[*] 50 [*]:[*] 30) and showed significant increase over F 1 (60 [*]:[*] 40 [*]:[*] 20) with superiority of 5. 4 and 5. 7 per cent during 2011 and 2012, respectively. The findings of the study concluded that ridge method of sowing of maize with NPK levels of 75 [*]:[*] 50 [*]:[*] 30 [*]kg[*]ha− 1 showed better performance of crop in terms of growth, yield, and yield attributes...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{to see the}} effects of levels of NPK fertilizers, plant density and sowing methods on the growth and yield of hybrid maize were carried out at the Agronomic Research Area, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan during spring 2006 and 2007. In experiment- 1, three fertilizer levels 200 - 100 - 100, 250 - 125 - 125 and 300 - 150 - 150 NPK kg ha- 1 and three planting densities 45 x 20 cm, 60 x 20 cm and 75 x 20 cm were used. Maximum grain yield (8. 56 t ha- 1 and 9. 12 t ha- 1 in 2006 and 2007, respectively) was recorded in T 6 treatment, when fertilizer was applied {{at the rate of}} 250 - 125 - 125 NPK kg ha- 1 and the crop was sown at spacing of 75 x 20 cm. Significantly higher values of physiological traits viz. harvest index, LAI and CGR in 2006 and 2007, respectively were observed with the same application of fertilizer and plant density as mentioned in grain yield. While, more values of NAR were recorded in T 9 treatment when NPK level was 300 - 150 - 150 kg ha- 1 and crop was sown at 75 x 20 cm in both years. Higher seed oil content (%) was recorded in F 1 treatment (200 - 100 - 100 NPK kg ha- 1, while maximum seed protein content (%) and seed starch content (%) were observed in F 3 (300 - 150 - 150 NPK kg ha- 1) and were not affected significantly by plant density in both the years. In experiment- 2, four levels of NPK (0 - 0 - 0, 200 - 100 - 100, 250 - 125 - 125 and 300 - 150 - 150 NPK kg ha- 1) and three sowing methods (flat sowing 75 cm apart rows, <b>ridge</b> <b>sowing</b> 75 cm apart ridges and bed sowing 120 / 30 cm apart beds) were compared. Higher grain yield (10. 02 t ha- 1 and 10. 54 t ha- 1 in both years) was recorded in T 8 treatment where fertilizer level was 250 - 125 - 125 NPK kg ha- 1 and maize was planted on 75 cm apart ridges. All grain yield contributing components were higher at this level of NPK and sowing method. All the physiological traits were significantly affected by different rates of NPK. Sowing methods, however, did not affect the HI (%) and CGR (g m- 2 day- 1), while significantly affected the LAI and NAR (g m- 2 day- 1). Higher values of HI were observed at 250 - 125 - 125 NPK kg ha- 1, those of LAI, CGR and NAR were obtained at 300 - 150 - 150 NPK kg ha- 1, respectively during 2006 and 2007. Higher seed oil content (%) was recorded in F 1 treatment (200 - 100 - 100 NPK kg ha- 1, while maximum seed protein content (%) and seed starch content (%) were observed in F 3 (300 - 150 - 150 NPK kg ha- 1) and were not affected significantly by sowing methods in both the years...|$|E
