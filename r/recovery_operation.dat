5|$|The {{original}} attempt, {{sponsored by}} Paul Allen and using his yacht Octopus, was abandoned after ten days in September 2012 due to unfavourable weather conditions. In 2015, {{the same team}} attempted a second <b>recovery</b> <b>operation</b> and the Hoods bell was finally retrieved on 7 August 2015. After conservation work, it was put {{on display in the}} museum in May 2016.|$|E
5|$|The <b>recovery</b> <b>operation</b> was {{guided by}} the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) with {{resources}} from the Canadian Forces, Canadian Coast Guard, RCMP, and other agencies. The area was surveyed using route survey sonar, laser line scanners, and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) to locate items. After being located, the debris was then recovered (initially by divers and ROVs, later by dredging and trawling).|$|E

5|$|The {{search and}} rescue response, crash <b>recovery</b> <b>operation,</b> and {{investigation}} by the Government of Canada took over four years and cost CAD 57 million (at that time approximately US$38 million). The Transportation Safety Board of Canada's (TSB) report of their investigation stated that flammable material used in the aircraft's structure allowed a fire to spread {{beyond the control of}} the crew, resulting in a loss of control and the crash of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Within {{three hours}} of the {{derailment}} {{the site of the}} accident had been sealed off with a five-mile cordon. The line was expected to be closed for two weeks, with Virgin Trains saying that the line would not reopen to passenger services until 12 March 2007. The <b>recovery</b> <b>operation</b> was slowed by problems in getting heavy lifting gear to the site which required temporary roads to be constructed.|$|E

25|$|During {{early stages}} of {{recovery}} after the accident the 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, flying RF-101C Voodoos out of RAF Upper Heyford near Oxford, England, provided aerial photographs {{to assist in the}} <b>recovery</b> <b>operation</b> and to document the crash site.|$|E
25|$|Following an outage in 2006 when an {{increase}} in creep-induced defect in boiler tubes was observed, Hinkley Point B and Hunterston B were restricted to about 70% of normal output from 2007 and operated at reduced boiler outlet temperatures. After <b>recovery,</b> <b>operation</b> at 80% of the nominal output was allowed.|$|E
25|$|On 6 August the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte {{announced}} that the <b>recovery</b> <b>operation</b> would be temporarily halted due to an upsurge in fighting around the crash site threatening the safety of crash investigators and recovery specialists, and that all international investigators and humanitarian forces conducting searches would leave the country leaving behind a small communications and liaison team.|$|E

25|$|A {{day after}} the prank was disclosed, Fleming's members began {{planning}} a <b>recovery</b> <b>operation</b> {{on the night of}} April 7. They immediately sent twenty-three members to Boston to retrieve their cannon. The Flems were greeted at MIT by a group of students and police who watched as the cannon was loaded into a truck. Afterward, a friendly barbecue celebrated the event.|$|E
25|$|The <b>recovery</b> <b>operation</b> {{was then}} {{taken over by}} the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command, whose primary role is to search for US {{military}} personnel missing overseas. On June 18, 2014, after two seasons of operations on the glacier, the Department of Defense announced that the remains of 17 of the victims had been identified and would be returned to their families for burial.|$|E
25|$|As {{the word}} of a missing diver in the Vortex Spring cave got out, other cave divers came for what they assumed would be a <b>recovery</b> <b>operation,</b> taking {{advantage}} of the weekend.

25|$|Throughout Antigua and Barbuda, {{losses from}} the {{hurricane}} amounted to EC$34million ($12.6million USD). In {{the wake of}} Earl, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies allocated roughly $50,000 (USD) in relief funds for the country. A three-month <b>recovery</b> <b>operation</b> was implemented {{within days of the}} storm's passage and focused on providing shelter and sustinance for the 1,000 families displaced by Earl. Additionally, economic assistance due to substantial crop losses was required, especially for families who depend on agriculture.|$|E
25|$|On 6 August 2014, {{the experts}} left {{the crash site}} due to {{concerns}} about their safety. In mid-September they unsuccessfully attempted to regain access to the site. On 13 October 2014, a Dutch-Ukrainian team resumed recovery of victims' personal belongings. In mid-November 2014, work was undertaken to remove part of the wreckage from the crash site. Earlier efforts by the recovery team to salvage the MH17 wreckage had been frustrated by disagreements with the local rebels. The <b>recovery</b> <b>operation</b> took one week to complete. The debris was transported to the Netherlands where investigators reconstructed parts of the plane.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{error correction}} procedures {{designed specifically for}} the amplitude damping channel. We analyze amplitude damping errors in the stabilizer formalism. This analysis allows a generalization of the [4, 1] `approximate' amplitude damping code of quant-ph/ 9704002. We present this generalization as a class of [2 (M+ 1),M] codes and present quantum circuits for encoding and <b>recovery</b> <b>operations.</b> We also present a [7, 3] amplitude damping code based on the classical Hamming code. All of these are stabilizer codes whose encoding and <b>recovery</b> <b>operations</b> can be completely described with Clifford group operations. Finally, we describe optimization options in which <b>recovery</b> <b>operations</b> may be further adapted according to the damping probability gamma. Comment: 11 pages, 12 figure...|$|R
25|$|On September 11, 2001, {{the city}} {{was the target of}} {{terrorist}} attacks. CUNY's Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC) lost an academic building called Fiterman Hall due to the collapse of the World Trade Center. The City University of New York BMCC Campus is the only higher education institution to have been directly affected by the 9/11 attacks. During the rescue and <b>recovery</b> <b>operation</b> for the World Trade Center, the Port Authority Police Department set up headquarters at CUNY's BMCC campus. The CUNY Public Safety SAFE Team evacuated neighboring apartment complexes such as Independence Plaza and assisted in area access control.|$|E
25|$|The job of {{individual}} identification took many weeks, and was largely done by teams of pathologists, dentists, and police. The mortuary team {{was led by}} Inspector Jim Morgan, who collated and edited {{a report on the}} <b>recovery</b> <b>operation.</b> Record keeping had to be meticulous because of the number and fragmented state of the human remains that had to be identified to the satisfaction of the coroner. From a purely technical point of view the exercise was both innovative and highly successful, with 83% of the deceased eventually being identified, sometimes from evidence such as a finger capable of yielding a print, or keys in a pocket.|$|E
25|$|The salvage {{operation}} {{was awarded to}} the Dutch salvage company Smit International. A team of five salvage experts boarded Kulluk on 2 January 2013 to assess the structural integrity of the grounded drilling barge. On 3 January, {{it was reported that}} Kulluk had suffered damage since the grounding but its structural integrity had not been compromised and there have been no leaks from the rig's fuel tanks. At the time of the grounding, Kulluk was carrying 139,000 gallons of diesel fuel and 12,000 gallons of lubricating and hydraulic oil. By 4 January, 14 vessels had been mobilized for the <b>recovery</b> <b>operation</b> and the United States Department of Defense provided two Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopters to transport heavy salvage gear to the site.|$|E
