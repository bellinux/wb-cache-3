Creep is described with Sherby's constitutive model. Secondary creep governing equations are derived and solved for a disc with two various boundary conditions and with linear distribution of SiC particles in pure Aluminum matrix. Since the creep rates are a function of stresses, time and temperature, there is not a closed form solution to these equations. Using a solution algorithm and the GDQ method, a solution procedure for these nonlinear equations is presented. Comparison of the results with other existing creep studies in literature reveals the robustness, precision and high efficiency beside rapid convergence of the present approach...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{analysis}} of steady state creep in a <b>rotating</b> <b>disc</b> made of Al-SiCp composite having variable thickness {{has been carried}} using Sherby’s constitutive model. The creep parameters have been evaluated using the available experimental results in the literature using regression analysis. Three variations in the thickness (constant, linearly and hyperbolic varying thickness) of the disc have been considered while keeping other material parameters same. The change in the radial stress in all the three cases is not significant while the tangential stress is changed with {{the change in the}} values of anisotropic constants. The tangential strain rates are highest at the inner radius of the disc and then decreases towards the outer radius of the discs. The radial strain rate which is compressive in nature becomes tensile in middle of the disc for some specific values of anisotropic constants. The study reveals that the anisotropy and thickness profile has a significant effect on the creep behavior of <b>rotating</b> <b>disc.</b> Thus for the safe design of the <b>rotating</b> <b>disc</b> the effect of anisotropy and profile should be taken care of...|$|R
