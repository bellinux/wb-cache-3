5|$|A {{population}} bottleneck is when {{a population}} contracts to a significantly smaller size over {{a short period of}} time due to some random environmental event. In a true population bottleneck, the odds for survival of any member of the population are purely random, and are not improved by any particular inherent genetic advantage. The bottleneck can result in <b>radical</b> <b>changes</b> in allele frequencies, completely independent of selection.|$|E

Mansell attempted to score the film based on Tchaikovsky's ballet but with <b>radical</b> <b>changes</b> to the music. Because {{of the use of}} Tchaikovsky's music, the score was deemed ineligible to be entered into the 2010 Academy Awards for Best Original Score.|$|E
40|$|This article {{offers a}} {{conceptual}} framework to understand <b>radical</b> <b>change.</b> It opens with a typology that defines change {{in terms of its}} pace and scope, and defines <b>radical</b> <b>change</b> as the swift transformation of an entire system. How <b>radical</b> <b>change</b> in public policy has occurred in the past is then documented. We find examples of <b>radical</b> <b>change</b> by chance, <b>radical</b> <b>change</b> by consensus, <b>radical</b> <b>change</b> by learning, and <b>radical</b> <b>change</b> by entrepreneurial design. <b>Radical</b> <b>change</b> by entrepreneurial design then becomes the focal point, in order to acquaint the reader with the strategies and tactics of well-known entrepreneurs who have been successful in molding and shaping the <b>radical</b> <b>change</b> process. The implications of this conceptual framework to acquisition reform conclude the paper, along with some suggestions for follow-on action.

Existing theories of change do not fully explain observations from our qualitative study; however, complexity theory constructs suggest how and why such change emerged. We offer four key findings. First, the <b>radical</b> <b>change</b> was unintended, emergent, and slow. Second, destabilizing conditions helped small changes to emerge and become radical. Third, subsequent actions amplified an initial small change and, though not intended to do so, promoted <b>radical</b> <b>change.</b> Finally, the dynamic interaction of amplifying actions, contextual conditions, and small changes led to continuous <b>radical</b> <b>change...</b>|$|R

As a member of a farmers' government, he was also involved in attempts to alleviate drought-induced poverty in southern Alberta and in investigations into the establishment of a provincial wheat pool.|$|E
5|$|On 11 October 1943, Lorković {{was named}} Minister of Interior, where he {{advocated}} stricter policing, {{and a second}} term as Foreign Minister from 29 April until 5 May 1944, after his friend Perić was removed from office. It was agreed that Lorković would remain Foreign Minister and Minister of Interior simultaneously, but was soon replaced by Mehmed Alajbegović as Foreign Minister. After realising that Germany would lose {{the war and the}} NDH would cease to exist, he advocated <b>radical</b> <b>changes</b> in state policy. In February 1944, he wrote a detailed memorandum in German which summarized the history, current situation and the fundamental problems of the NDH and its Armed Forces, as well as problems with the German Army.|$|E
5|$|The tactics {{were also}} {{unsuitable}} for fighter-versus-fighter combat. Packed in tight formation, the RAF pilots {{were more concerned}} with keeping their position and not colliding with each other than they were keeping watch for the enemy. It made them vulnerable to surprise attacks by Bf 109s and Bf 110s. Even if the British fighters reached the bombers without interception, the chaos of modern aerial combat {{made it impossible to}} concentrate attacks with large, rigid formations. Pilots were also forced into paying far too much respect to the bomber's defensive capabilities. Attacks were broken off far too early and caused little damage to bombers. These tactical failures were evident during the battles in Belgium and France. Moreover, rushed training with pilots who were barely able to use the old tactical methods meant that airmen could not cope with much needed <b>radical</b> <b>changes.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Radical</b> <b>change</b> can be {{conceived}} {{in terms of}} the reconceiving of ontological distinctions, such as those separating humans from animals. In building on insights from French pragmatism, we suggest that, while no doubt very difficult, <b>radical</b> <b>change</b> can potentially be achieved by creating “alignment” between multiple “economies of worth” or “common worlds” (e. g., the market world of money, the industrial world of efficiency). Using recent campaigns by animal rights organizations as our case, we show how the design of “tests” (e. g., tests of profitability, tests of efficiency) can help align multiple common worlds in support for <b>radical</b> <b>change.</b> Our analysis contributes to the broader management and organization studies literatures by conceiving <b>radical</b> <b>change</b> in terms of changing ontological categorizations (e. g., human/animals vs. sentient/ non-sentient), and by proposing that <b>radical</b> social <b>change</b> agents can be helpfully conceived as opportunistically using events to cumulatively justify the change they desire overtime...|$|R
40|$|Summary Based on {{the merger}} of two Swedish {{university}} hospitals, this paper examines top management's work in implementing <b>radical</b> <b>change</b> initiatives. Our case confirms {{the limitations of the}} classic top-down approach to <b>radical</b> <b>change</b> in professional organizations. We also identify an important paradox: contrary to contemporary change literature prescription, initial managerial success seems to impair the change process further down the organization. A key finding is that when mergers are used as tools to effect <b>radical</b> <b>change</b> in politically ambiguous environment, management appears to be limited to initiate change and to take the role of the scapegoat due to inherent factors in the change process. By elucidating management's difficult role vis-à-vis multiple stakeholders, this paper contributes to one aspect of managerial agency discourse that is rarely discussed in detail.

40|$|Leadership {{experts agree}} that a key {{challenge}} facing leaders {{now and in the}} future is responsiveness to <b>radical</b> <b>change.</b> This article continues prior work on <b>radical</b> <b>change</b> with theory and research on leadership style. The result is a model of <b>radical</b> <b>change</b> describing the leadership styles best suited to the successful implementation of each stage in the change process. Using the Leadership Style Inventory, leaders can determine which stages of <b>radical</b> <b>change</b> they are equipped to handle. The article explores how individual and group leadership style limitations can be dealt with to ensure <b>radical</b> <b>change</b> success. The key component of successful leadership now and in the next century is proactive and effective responsiveness to change. Experts agree that successful leaders must be flexible and capable of adapting to new conditions, open to novel alternatives, and willing to take greater risks (Kotter, 1990; O’Toole, 1996). Too often leaders and managers address technical dimensions of change but fail to consider what it takes at each stage for leaders to actually carry out tha...|$|R
5|$|Victorian {{painting}} {{had gone}} through <b>radical</b> <b>changes,</b> and by the 1870s the realism of Etty and the Pre-Raphaelites {{had given way to}} the ideas of the Aesthetic Movement, abandoning the traditions of storytelling and moralising in favour of painting works designed for aesthetic appeal rather than for their narrative or subject. Although the aesthetic movement ultimately led to a brief revival of history painting, these works were in a very different style to Etty's. The new generation of history painters such as Edward Burne-Jones, Lawrence Alma-Tadema and Frederic Leighton sought to depict passivity, rather than the dynamism seen in previous works depicting the classical world. By the end of the 19th century, the value of all of Etty's works had fallen below their original prices. As the 20th century began, the increasingly influential Modernist movement, which came to dominate British art in the 20th century, drew its inspiration from Paul Cézanne and had little regard for 19th-century British painting.|$|E
5|$|With the {{transition}} to more advanced gaming hardware, series artist Keiji Inafune explained {{that the development of}} Mega Man X involved reinventing Mega Man through gameplay expansion and a more mature storyline while still maintaining the basic concepts on which the franchise was built. Much like the NES Mega Man games that came before it, Mega Man X is a standard action-platform game where the player takes control of the eponymous character and must complete a set of eight, initial stages in any order desired. Defeating the boss character {{at the end of each}} stage grants the player one new weapon that can then be toggled and used at will for the remainder of the game. However, Mega Man X adds a number of new features and makes <b>radical</b> <b>changes</b> to the original gameplay mechanics of previous releases in the series. These include allowing the player to dash along the ground, scale walls, and obtain armor attachments which grant special abilities.|$|E
5|$|Wright {{was sacked}} by Arsenal in June 1966 {{and the board}} of {{directors}} hired the club's physiotherapist Bertie Mee as his successor. Mee insisted on an escape clause in his contract provided if the arrangement did not work, which the club duly obliged. The position became permanent eleven months later, even though Arsenal were 14th in the league table. The club's fortunes changed under Mee however, as he started to bed in youth players. He led Arsenal to successive League Cup final appearances in 1968 and 1969, and ended the club's 17-year wait for silverware when his side beat Anderlecht in the 1970 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final. Mee's greatest triumph was the club's league and cup double of 1970–71, but he struggled to better that achievement, having made <b>radical</b> <b>changes</b> to a successful team.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, {{preparations}} {{began to}} raise the school leaving age to 16. These were delayed in 1968, and eventually the decision was taken in 1971 that the new upper age limit be enforced from 1 September 1972 onwards. As well as raising the school leaving age in 1972, the year also saw {{the introduction of the}} Education (Work Experience) Act, allowing LEAs to organise work experience for the additional final year school students. In some counties around the country, these changes also led to the introduction of middle schools in 1968, where students were kept at primary or junior school for an additional year, meaning that the number of students in secondary schools within these areas remained virtually constant through the change. In others, more <b>radical</b> <b>changes</b> led to middle schools for pupils aged up to 13 opening in smaller secondary school buildings, with other schools accommodating students over 13. As of 2010, there are fewer than 300 middle schools across England, situated in just 22 local education authorities; the number of remaining middle schools has gradually fallen since the mid-1980s.|$|E
5|$|Domestically, Henry {{is known}} for his <b>radical</b> <b>changes</b> to the English Constitution, {{ushering}} in the theory of the divine right of kings to England. Besides asserting the sovereign's supremacy over the Church of England, he greatly expanded royal power during his reign. Charges of treason and heresy were commonly used to quash dissent, and those accused were often executed without a formal trial, by means of bills of attainder. He achieved many of his political aims through the work of his chief ministers, some of whom were banished or executed when they fell out of his favour. Thomas Wolsey, Thomas More, Thomas Cromwell, Richard Rich, and Thomas Cranmer all figured prominently in Henry's administration. He was an extravagant spender and used the proceeds from the Dissolution of the Monasteries and acts of the Reformation Parliament to convert into royal revenue the money that was formerly paid to Rome. Despite the influx of money from these sources, Henry was continually on the verge of financial ruin due to his personal extravagance as well as his numerous costly continental wars, particularly with Francis I of France and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, as he sought to enforce his claim to the Kingdom of France. At home, he oversaw the legal union of England and Wales with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 and following the Crown of Ireland Act 1542 he was the first English monarch to rule as King of Ireland.|$|E
