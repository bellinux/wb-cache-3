25|$|In 2009, Yak-Service {{had been}} {{investigated}} by the European Commission, following airworthiness and air safety concerns. Russian authorities imposed restrictions on the carrier, and made Yak-Service subject to <b>ramp</b> <b>inspections</b> to international standards. In 2010, Yak-Service had been banned from making flights into European airspace. The Russian transport ministry on 18 May 2010, prohibited Yak-Service from flying into Europe. On 11 August 2010, the operating restrictions were removed by Russian authorities. The European Commission, however, was not satisfied that mandatory equipment was present on all Yak-Service aircraft, and banned two of the company's Yakovlev Yak-40s from operating in European airspace.|$|E

50|$|However, <b>ramp</b> <b>inspections</b> {{are limited}} to on-the-spot {{assessments}} and cannot substitute for proper regulatory oversight, thus, they cannot guarantee the airworthiness of a particular aircraft. Where irregularities have an immediate impact on safety, inspectors can demand corrective actions before they allow the aircraft to leave.|$|E
50|$|On 28 October 2012, the Implementing Rules on Air Operations {{entered into}} force {{as the new}} legal basis for the EU ramp {{inspection}} programme, replacing the original system established by the SAFA Directive and its implementing regulations with a new system represented by the new EU <b>Ramp</b> <b>Inspections</b> Programme.|$|E
5000|$|Due {{to safety}} and {{maintenance}} concerns, Air Koryo {{was added to}} the list of air carriers banned in the European Union in March 2006. The European Commission found evidence of serious safety deficiencies on the part of Air Koryo during <b>ramp</b> <b>inspections</b> in France and Germany. Air Koryo persistently failed to address these issues during other subsequent <b>ramp</b> <b>inspections</b> performed by the EU under the SAFA programme, pointing to blatant systemic safety deficiencies at Air Koryo operations. The airline failed to reply to an inquiry by the French Civil Aviation Authority regarding its safety operations, pointing to a lack of transparency or communication on the part of Air Koryo. The plan by Air Koryo for corrective action, presented in response to France's request, was found to be inadequate and insufficient. The EC also held that North Korean authorities did not adequately oversee the flag carrier, which it was obliged to do under the Chicago Convention. Therefore, {{on the basis of the}} common criteria, the Commission assessed that Air Koryo did not meet the relevant safety standards.'''' ...|$|E
25|$|Design {{engineers}} {{decided to}} mount the nacelles directly to {{the underside of the}} wings to reduce the landing gear length and kept the engines low to the ground for easy <b>ramp</b> <b>inspection</b> and servicing. Many thickness variations for the engine attachment strut were tested in the wind tunnel and the most desirable shape for high speed was found to be one which was relatively thick, filling the narrow channels formed between the wing and the top of the nacelle, particularly on the outboard side.|$|R

5000|$|Shortly before 6:00 PM on Wednesday, October 15, 2014, a pilot on an in-bound FedEx Express McDonnell Douglas MD-10-30 {{noticed a}} {{possible}} engine fire {{on one of}} the engines, with smoke showing. The aircraft declared an emergency and landed successfully. Emergency ground crews reported to the incident and determined that the on-board extinguishers had successfully extinguished the fire. Maintenance crews determined the aircraft could safely be towed to the cargo <b>ramp</b> for <b>inspection</b> and repairs.|$|R

But, as rains started, the new parking lot became murky with slush and mud and it became difficult for drivers to drive out vehicles resulting in creation of traffic blocks in the city.

50|$|October 27, 1994 JACKSONVILLE, FL, CESSNA 210L, N732CQ, Injuries: 1 Uninjured: The {{pilot was}} on {{approach}} at the destination airport {{and lowered the}} landing gear. The right main landing gear did not illuminate. The pilot completed the emergency procedure from memory and visually checked the landing gear. The landing gear appeared to be extended. The pilot landed without further incident and taxied to the <b>ramp.</b> Visual <b>inspection</b> of the landing gear revealed the right main landing gear {{was not in the}} lock position. The pilot called maintenance personnel on the phone and was informed to reposition the airplane to another airport with the landing gear down to get a replacement airplane. The pilot flew the airplane to the maintenance base. On landing rollout, the right main landing gear collapsed. Examination of the landing gear by the FAA revealed improper rigging of the right main landing gear down lock mechanism due to normal wear. The probable cause was the pilot's decision to depart an airport and continue flight with known deficient equipment. Contributing to the accident was the failure of company maintenance personnel to adjust the down lock mechanism prior to flight.|$|R
50|$|DICV {{set up a}} {{manufacturing}} plant for the BharatBenz trucks in Oragadam, near Chennai in Tamil Nadu at an investment of over €700 million (44 billion). This is its biggest investment outside Europe. Construction area for plant is 400 acres, out of which 47 acres are dedicated to 3-lane 1.55 kilometer test track. Test track include a bump track, pothole testing and articulation sections, a water trough, an <b>inspection</b> <b>ramp</b> and a control tower. Initial production capacity at the plant was 36000 units per year for 2012 and was to be expanded to 70,000 units per year {{by the start of}} 2013 with an additional investment of 3.5 billion. Series production started in June 2012 with the 2523R truck; sales began in September 2012.|$|R
