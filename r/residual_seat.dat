50|$|Before the {{periodic}} review effected in 1983, the new town of Milton Keynes, including its older parts such as Bletchley and Fenny Stratford {{was in the}} constituency. The review followed the previous national review in 1974 and recognised the large increase in electorate in the seat. The sitting Buckingham MP William Benyon stood for the then-created Milton Keynes constituency where he was elected. The <b>residual</b> <b>seat</b> was won in 1983 by Conservative George Walden. Walden retired in 1997, and John Bercow won the following general elections in 2001, 2005, 2010 and 2015. In 2009, Bercow was elected as Speaker of the House of Commons following the resignation of Michael Martin {{and there is an}} inconsistently followed convention not to oppose a professed speaker candidate at election which is mostly kept by the major parties â€” nonetheless UKIP's leader stood against Bercow in the 2010 election but finished third behind the Buckinghamshire Campaign for Democracy founder who previously founded the Pro-Euro Conservative Party.|$|E
50|$|However, the way {{residual}} {{seats are}} assigned, {{by using the}} D'Hondt method, a highest averages method, means that smaller parties are unlikely to get a <b>residual</b> <b>seat,</b> while larger parties have a bigger chance of getting one and may even get more than one. Firstly, numbers of seats are always rounded down, meaning there are always residual seats and parties that did not reach the quota do not get any seats (they do not {{take part in the}} following calculation). Next, the number of votes is divided by the assigned seats plus one. The party with the highest resulting number then gets one extra seat. Next, the process is repeated, with the party that got the extra seat participating again, albeit with a number one higher because they got an extra seat (the calculation stays the same for the other parties, which got no extra seat). But later on in the process, that party may get another extra seat. And since there are many parties in the House of Representatives, this is not unlikely to happen.|$|E
50|$|When {{the largest}} party gets over 35% {{of the votes}} and is {{considerably}} bigger than the next biggest party, that party may even {{get as much as}} 3 or even 4 <b>residual</b> <b>seats.</b> This has, however, never happened. The percentage of votes for the biggest party is usually around 30% and rarely goes far beyond that. The largest result ever was at the 1989 elections, when CDA got 35.3% of the votes. Even then, however, CDA only got two <b>residual</b> <b>seats</b> because next biggest party (PvdA) had 31.9% of the votes. The biggest difference {{between the first and second}} party was at the 2002 elections, the most dramatic elections in Dutch history, when especially PvdA lost many votes to LPF, which became second biggest after CDA with 17.0% of the votes. CDA, however, had only 27.9% of the votes and therefore still only got 2 <b>residual</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|R
50|$|For example, in 2003 (see table here), {{the three}} biggest parties each got {{two of the}} six <b>residual</b> <b>seats,</b> even the VVD (150*0.179=26.85, but they got 28 seats, {{representing}} 18.7% of the seats instead of 17.9%), whereas the Socialist Party got none (150*0.063 = 9.45, but they got only 9 seats, representing 6% of the seats instead of 6.3%).|$|R
50|$|Parties may, however, form an {{alliance}} (lijstencombinatie), {{in which case}} they participate in the above calculations as one party and get a bigger chance of gaining <b>residual</b> <b>seats</b> (or getting one in the first place). The division of those seats between those parties is, however, done in a different way, by using the largest remainder method, which favours the smaller parties rather than the bigger ones {{if there is a}} considerable difference in size. But the overall advantage is greatest for small parties of comparable size.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{establish}} the validity and reliability of a hydrostatic weighing method using total lung capacity (measuring vital capacity with a respirometer at the time of weighing) the prone position, and a small oblong tank. The validity of the method was established by comparing the TLC prone (tank) method against three hydrostatic weighing methods administered in a pool. The three methods included <b>residual</b> volume <b>seated,</b> TLC seated and TLC prone. Eighty male and female subjects were underwater weighed using each of the four methods. Validity coefficients for per cent body fat between the TLC prone (tank) method and the RV seated (pool), TLC seated (pool) and TLC prone (pool) methods were. 98,. 99 and. 99, respectively. A randomised complete block ANOVA found significant differences between the RV seated (pool) method and each of the three TLC methods with respect to both body density and per cent body fat. The differences were negligible with respect to HW error. Reliability of the TLC prone (tank) method was established by weighing twenty subjects three different times with ten-minute time intervals between testing. Multiple correlations yielded reliability coefficients for body density and per cent body fat values of. 99 and. 99, respectively. It was concluded that the TLC prone (tank) method is valid, reliable and a favourable method of hydrostatic weighing...|$|R
