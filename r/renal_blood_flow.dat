25|$|Regardless of the cause, {{sequestration}} {{of fluid}} within the abdomen leads to additional fluid retention by the kidneys due to stimulatory effect on blood pressure hormones, notably aldosterone.

Decreased erythrocyte deformability and increased aggregation may be detected after surgery performed under general anesthesia. It was shown that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs decrease erythrocyte deformability. Lornoxicam and/or intravenous (iv) ibuprofen are commonly preferred analgesic agents for postoperative pain management. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of lornoxicam (2  mg/kg, iv) and ibuprofen (30  mg/kg, iv) on erythrocyte deformability, as well as hepatic and <b>renal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flows,</b> in male rats. Methods: Eighteen male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into three groups as follows: iv lornoxicam-treated group (Group L), iv ibuprofen-treated group (Group İ), and control group (Group C). Drug administration {{was carried out by}} the iv route in all groups except Group C. Hepatic and <b>renal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flows</b> were studied by laser Doppler, and euthanasia was performed via intra-abdominal blood uptake. Erythrocyte deformability was measured using a constant-flow filtrometry system. Results: Lornoxicam and ibuprofen increased the relative resistance, which is an indicator of erythrocyte deformability, of rats (P= 0. 016). Comparison of the results from Group L and Group I revealed no statistically significant differences (P= 0. 694), although the erythrocyte deformability levels in Group L and Group I were statistically higher than the results observed in Group C (P= 0. 018 and P= 0. 008, respectively). Hepatic and <b>renal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flows</b> were significantly lower than the same in Group C. Conclusion: We believe that lornoxicam and ibuprofen may lead to functional disorders related to renal and liver tissue perfusion secondary to both decreased <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and erythrocyte deformability.

50|$|Angiotensin II has {{a direct}} effect on the {{proximal}} tubules to increase Na+ reabsorption.

A number of other mechanisms can affect <b>renal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and GFR. High concentrations of Angiotensin II can constrict the glomerular mesangium, reducing the area for glomerular filtration. Angiotensin II is a sensitizer to tubuloglomerular feedback, preventing an excessive rise in GFR. Angiotensin II causes the local release of prostaglandins, which, in turn, antagonize renal vasoconstriction. The net effect of these competing mechanisms on glomerular filtration will vary with the physiological and pharmacological environment.|$|E

40|$|Effect of l-arginine on adrenal and <b>renal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flows</b> during {{hemorrhage}} in cats. Our {{earlier studies}} have shown development of endothelial dysfunction in the feline renal artery during hemorrhagic hypotension. Because l-arginine (L-Arg), the precursor of nitric oxide (NO), reportedly improves endothelial function in several pathophysiological states including hypotension, we investigated its possible beneficial effect on the adrenal and renal circulations during hemorrhagic hypotension in anesthetized, ventilated cats. Hypotension (mean arterial pressure 50 mm Hg) significantly increased vascular resistance and decreased <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> (radiolabeled microspheres) in both adrenal and renal cortices. L-Arg (30 mg/kg bolus, 10 mg/kg/min infusion, i. v.) had no significant hemodynamic effects in normotension but prevented the increase of the vascular resistance and improved <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> in the adrenal cortex during hypotension. In the kidney, L-Arg also prevented hemorrhage-induced vasoconstriction, although its effect on <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> did not reach significance. The NO synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-l-arginine (30 mg/kg bolus, 1 mg/kg/min infusion, i. v.) increased adrenal and renal vascular resistances to a similar extent as that observed during hypotension.

Twelve months after left renal artery clipping or sham, mean arterial pressure, <b>renal</b> cortical <b>blood</b> <b>flow,</b> and <b>renal</b> cortical and medullary oxygen tension were measured after acute administration of Tempol followed by enalaprilat or candesartan followed by enalaprilat. The mean arterial pressure of the 2 K, 1 C rat was reduced by candesartan (9 %) and, more effectively, by Tempol (35 %). All of the applied treatments had similar blood pressure–lowering effects in sham rats (average: 21 %). Only Tempol increased cortical <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> (35 %) and cortical and medullary oxygen tensions (17 % and 94 %, respectively) in clipped kidneys of 2 K, 1 C rats.
