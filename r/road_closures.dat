5|$|As {{the storm}} made {{landfall}} in Nova Scotia, the outer bands produced heavy rains and strong winds over eastern Maine. Wind gusts were recorded up to 45mph (75km/h) in coastal Hancock County. The strong winds toppled trees, leaving 500 customers without power. Rainfall generally amounted from 3 to 4.5in (76.2 to 114.3mm), {{with a maximum}} of 7.15in (181.61mm) in Sedgwick Ridge.

5|$|Double deck buses show an {{intermediate}} points display, {{as well as}} a final destination. The company's double decker buses are unique in Scotland in still displaying the destination at both the front and rear. In early mornings and late evenings, some services are curtailed to the city centre or to early termini, in the transition to the night bus service. In such cases, 'Part Route' is displayed in the intermediate display. Certain routes have all day short working termini, and minor diversions which are often indicated through the use of internal or external 'tram boards'. Since 2006 double-deck deliveries feature a 'Route Diverted; intermediate display, used when <b>road</b> <b>closures</b> cause a service to be diverted from its normal route.|$|E
5|$|Fierce waves pushed {{large amounts}} of water to coastal areas in Fujairah of the United Arab Emirates, forcing roads to be closed and traffic diverted. Civil defence and police were on duty to manage the <b>road</b> <b>closures,</b> while {{municipal}} workers pumped the excess water off the roads. The road connecting Kalba and Fujairah was closed due to the road being submerged by water. The waves along the coastline were reported to be 10m (32ft) high, which destroyed about a dozen fishing boats. About 300boats were moved from the water or emptied of equipment, and overall damage to the port of Fujairah was reported as severe. A boat sank by the port, leaving its ten passengers missing.|$|E
5|$|The club {{succeeded in}} a further legal {{challenge}} bought by small firms in January 2005 as the High Court upheld {{a decision by}} then-Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott to grant a compulsory purchase order {{in support of the}} scheme. The stadium later became issue in the local elections in May 2006. The Metropolitan Police restricted supporters' coaches to being parked in the nearby Sobel Sports Centre rather than in the underground stadium car park, and restricted access to 14 streets on match days. These police restrictions were conditions of the stadiums' health and safety certificate which the stadium requires to operate and open. The <b>road</b> <b>closures</b> were passed at a council meeting in July 2005.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} brought light precipitation to Bermuda, but {{no significant}} damage was reported there. Moderate rainfall accompanied its two landfalls in the United States, causing localized flash flooding and <b>road</b> <b>closures.</b> Floodwaters forced {{the evacuation of}} a nursing home and several mobile homes in South Carolina. Kyle spawned at least four tornadoes, the costliest of which struck Georgetown, South Carolina; it damaged 106buildings and destroyed seven others, causing eight injuries. Overall damage totaled about $5million (2002USD, $ USD), and no direct deaths were reported. However, the remnants of Kyle contributed to one indirect death in the British Isles.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{tropical}} cyclone warnings and watches were issued for areas along the East Coast of the United States. A {{state of emergency}} was declared for 26North Carolina counties, and both mandatory and voluntary evacuations were imposed along the state's coast. Several hundred government personnel were deployed to assist in evacuation and preparation efforts, along with heavy equipment capable of removing sand and debris. Due to the hurricane's timing, many Independence Day activities in the U.S. were cancelled or rescheduled. Damage was limited to strewn debris and inundated roads, and though 44,000power outages were reported and widespread flooding occurred along northern sections of the coast, no deaths or serious injuries were reported. In New England, Arthur brought flash flooding and caused additional power outages, resulting in widespread <b>road</b> <b>closures</b> and suspension of ferry service. Losses in the country amounted to US$3.25million.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} disturbance to Tropical Storm Arlene dropped {{heavy rainfall}} over Central America. As a result, 20fatalities occurred, {{all of which}} were from a mudslide in El Salvador. Heavy rainfall also produced heavy rainfall on the Yucatán Peninsula. After Arlene became a tropical cyclone, rainfall in Mexico inundated areas of Campeche, where damage totaled US$33million. In total, five people were killed in Mexico. Flood damage in South Texas was extensive, with widespread urban flooding and <b>road</b> <b>closures.</b> Entire plots of farmland were inundated by torrential rains brought by Arlene. The landfalling Arlene interacted with a passing cold front which helped to produce showers further northeast, though damage in those locales was comparatively less severe. In total, Arlene caused 26deaths and at least US$60.8million in damage.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Humberto left 10homes {{completely}} destroyed in Galveston County, {{with an additional}} 19 severely damaged in the county; several homes received minor shingle damage, and <b>road</b> <b>closures</b> left about 5,000houses isolated in the county. The combination of saturated grounds and strong winds uprooted many trees and downed power lines across {{the path of the}} hurricane, with at least 50high voltage transmission poles blown down or seriously damaged; over 120,000power customers in Orange and Jefferson counties lost power, with 118,000Entergy customers in the state without electricity. Widespread flooding occurred in Jefferson and Orange counties, and at least 20homes in Beaumont were flooded. Additionally, several roadways were flooded. The passage of the hurricane caused one fatality in the state; a Bridge City man was killed when his carport crashed on him outside his house. Initially, press reports indicated that the storm wrought up to $500million in damage; however, final damage estimates were about $50million.|$|E
5|$|Rainfall {{reached over}} 10inches (250mm) {{in the coastal}} region of Jalisco, and lighter amounts of {{precipitation}} extended further to the southeast and northeast. One person was reported missing in Jalisco. The heaviest 24‑hour rainfall total {{in the state of}} Sinaloa was 8.66inches (220mm), whereas in Sonora a maximum of 4.72inches (120mm) of rain were recorded. Strong waves from the hurricane struck the Mexican mainland, with four people injured at Mazatlán when their boat washed onto rocks and was destroyed. Rainfall from the storm flooded 15communities in and around Mazatlán, and the Army assisted residents in emergency evacuations. At Los Mochis, near the point where Isis made landfall, the hurricane resulted in the destruction of 300homes, as well as in seven fatalities. Throughout the city, strong winds from the hurricane downed street posts, tree limbs, and power lines, with one person seriously injured from a downed power line. Additionally, the roof of a gas station collapsed from the winds. More than 1,200bus passengers in Sinaloa were stranded due to <b>road</b> <b>closures</b> from the hurricane, including the closure of the coastal highway in the southern portion of Sinaloa as it had been washed out due to floodwaters. Rainfall from the storm caused severe river flooding in some locations, and authorities advised those living along the Fuerte River to be prepared for a possible evacuation. The winds from Isis left about 120,000people in the municipality of Ahome without power.|$|E
