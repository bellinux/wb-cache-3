25|$|On 18 March 2015 it was {{announced}} that Stand Alone Complex would receive a full weekly <b>rebroadcasting</b> in Japan on BS11, starting on 1 April 2015 onward.|$|E

25|$|In December 1956, {{two years}} after its inaugural telecast, CFRN-TV {{increased}} its transmitter's power to 180,300 watts. In 1958, CFRN-TV fed live {{the opening of the}} Alberta Legislature, by microwave to a five-station Alberta Network. In June 1961, <b>rebroadcasting</b> stations were established at Edson and Carrot Creek. CFRN disaffiliated from CBC Television on September 30, 1961, as that network established its own station in Edmonton, CBXT (channel 5). On October 1 of that year, CFRN-TV became an affiliate of the CTV Television Network, receiving its programming via microwave relay during hours when the CBC was not using it, and time-delaying programs via videotape. Two more <b>rebroadcasting</b> stations were added at Whitecourt and Ashmont in 1966.|$|E
25|$|The 2012 Summer Olympics {{prompted}} BBC Breakfast {{to temporarily}} broadcast from an interim studio near the Olympic Park in Stratford. During the games, former presenters Sian Williams and Chris Hollins also returned {{to lead the}} morning programme, in addition to Bill Turnbull and BBC Sport presenter Hazel Irvine. The show ended its temporary London return with broadcasting from the BBC News Channel's studio on the morning following the closing ceremonies before <b>rebroadcasting</b> from Salford the next day.|$|E
25|$|Sailor Moon {{sparked a}} highly {{successful}} merchandising campaign of over 5,000 items, which contributed to demand internationally and translation into numerous languages. Sailor Moon has since {{become one of the}} most famous anime properties in the world. Due to its resurgence of popularity in Japan, the series was rebroadcast on September 1, 2009. The series also began <b>rebroadcasting</b> in Italy in Autumn 2010, receiving permission from Naoko Takeuchi, who released new artwork to promote its return.|$|E
25|$|In September 1966, network colour {{transmission}} started, {{with local}} colour facilities for program and commercial production being installed in 1970, and a mobile colour television unit became operational in 1975. More <b>rebroadcasting</b> stations were added at Lac La Biche (1968), Grande Prairie and Peace River (1970), Rocky Mountain House and Crimson Lake (1971), Red Deer (1973) and Slave Lake, Grouard and Lougheed (1979), Jasper (1992) and Athabasca (1993). In 1974, CFRN-TV moved its transmitter {{to a new}} site with a 915-foot tower, operating at 250,000 watts.|$|E
25|$|On August 18, 2011, the CRTC {{issued a}} {{decision}} that allows CBC's mandatory market <b>rebroadcasting</b> transmitters in analogue to remain on-air until August 31, 2012. Before that deadline, CBC's licence renewal process would take place and CBC's digital transition plans would be examined {{as part of that}} process. The requirement remains for all of CBC's full-power transmitters occupying channels 52 to 69 to either relocate to channels 2 to 51 or become low-power transmitters. In some cases, CBC has opted to reduce the power of existing transmitters to low-power transmitters, which will result in signal loss for some viewers.|$|E
25|$|WJRT-TV (ABC), {{formerly}} one of ten ABC owned-and-operated stations, {{is currently}} the only area station to operate from Flint. WSMH (Fox) and WCMZ-TV (PBS) are licensed to Flint, but their programming originates from outside of Flint proper, with WSMH originating from Flint suburb Mt. Morris Township (though its mailing address says Flint) and WCMZ <b>rebroadcasting</b> WCMU-TV of Mount Pleasant. WEYI (NBC), licensed to Saginaw, and WBSF (The CW), licensed to Bay City, share studios with WSMH. Other stations outside the Flint area that serve the area include Saginaw-based WNEM-TV (CBS) (which has a news bureau in Downtown Flint), Delta College's WDCQ-TV (PBS), and Saginaw's WAQP (TCT).|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} prior BS Zelda games, Inishie no Sekiban was also well received, winning {{official}} recognition by Nintendo for gaining a spot among the Top 30 Player's choice votes for BS titles. The Korean Game Developer's Conference would later cite Inishie no Sekiban {{as one of}} the Satellaview titles primarily responsible for fostering a sense of collegial competition between Japanese players through St.GIGA's publishing of score ranking tables. The successes of the game among the gaming public prompted Nintendo and St.GIGA's <b>rebroadcasting</b> it again for three additional reruns. Reruns were broadcast in June 1997, in December 1998, and to mark the dissolution of the partnership between St.GIGA and Nintendo as the final SoundLink Game ever broadcast via Satellaview in May 1999.|$|E
25|$|A {{consequence}} of the conflict in Niger {{was a series of}} arrests of domestic journalists, and expulsions or closings of foreign press and aid groups. The state of emergency in the Agadez Region, re-authorised every six months since November 2007, has barred foreign press or aid from the area. In mid-2008, the French charity Doctors without borders (MSF) was forced to close a childhood malnutrition treatment program in Maradi Region which had been operating since 2005. MSF was subsequently ejected from the country by the Nigerien government. The <b>rebroadcasting</b> of foreign radio broadcasts in Niger has been interupped several times since mid-2007 by government order. Nigerien journalists say they are often pressured by local authorities. The north, under a state of emergency, has become off-limits to both domestic and foreign press, and the independent Radio Agadez in the north has been closed by the government.|$|E
500|$|The Minister may {{declare that}} any foreign {{broadcasting}} service which is rebroadcast in Singapore has been [...] "engaging {{in the domestic}} politics of Singapore". <b>Rebroadcasting</b> such a [...] "declared foreign broadcasting service" [...] is prohibited without the Minister's approval, which can be refused, revoked without reasons, or granted on conditions, which may include restrictions {{on the number of}} people permitted to receive the service and suspensions of the service for certain periods. Failing to comply with the above rules is a crime punishable by a fine of up to $100,000.|$|E
500|$|Skelton changed {{sponsors}} in 1948; Brown & Williamson, {{owners of}} Raleigh cigarettes, withdrew due to program production costs. His new sponsor was Procter & Gamble's Tide laundry detergent. The {{next year he}} changed networks, going from NBC to CBS, where his radio show aired until May 1953. After his network radio contract was over, he signed a three-year contract with Ziv Radio for a syndicated radio program in 1954. His syndicated radio program was offered as a daily show; it included segments of his older network radio {{programs as well as}} new material done for the syndication. [...] He was able to use portions of his older radio shows because he owned the rights for <b>rebroadcasting</b> them.|$|E
500|$|According to the Nielsen Media Research, [...] "Woman Seeking Dead Husband: Smokers Okay, No Pets" [...] {{was viewed}} by {{a total of}} 4.35million people in its {{original}} USA Network broadcast. This totaled to approximately 3.04million households which viewed the episode. The NBC <b>rebroadcasting</b> of the episode received a 2.8rating/5share in the 18–49 demographic, meaning that on average 2.8percent of all television-equipped households were tuned in to the installment at any given moment, while 5percent of households watching TV were tuned into it during the time slot. This was a drop in viewership compared to the previous episode, [...] "Speak Now or Forever Hold Your Piece", which brought in 4.69 million viewers and a 1.6rating/5share. The viewership was also significantly lower than the following episode, [...] "9 Lives", which was seen by 4.72 million people and also brought in a 1.6rating/5share.|$|E
500|$|Mutual {{also began}} {{building}} {{a reputation as}} a strong news service, rivaling the industry leaders in quality if not budget. The broadcasts of WOR reporter Gabriel Heatter from the Lindbergh kidnapping [...] "trial of the century" [...] in 1935, heard over Mutual, were highly regarded; Heatter soon had his own regularly scheduled newscast, aired nationally five nights a week. In 1936, also via WOR, Mutual began broadcasting the reports of news commentator Raymond Gram Swing, who became one of the country's leading voices on foreign affairs. In November 1937, conservative commentator Fulton Lewis Jr., heard five nights weekly from Mutual affiliate WOL, became the first national news personality to broadcast out of Washington, D.C.; he would remain with the network until his death almost three decades later. In 1938, Mutual started <b>rebroadcasting</b> news reports from the BBC and English-language newscasts from the European mainland. The network also began employing its own reporters in Europe as the continent headed toward crisis, including John Steele, Waverly Root, Arthur Mann, and Victor Lusinchi. Among these was Sigrid Schultz, the first accomplished female foreign correspondent to appear on American news radio.|$|E
500|$|The Minister may {{declare that}} any foreign {{broadcasting}} service which is rebroadcast in Singapore has been [...] "engaging {{in the domestic}} politics of Singapore". <b>Rebroadcasting</b> such a [...] "declared foreign broadcasting service" [...] is prohibited without the Minister's approval, which can be refused, revoked without reasons, or granted on conditions, which may include restrictions {{on the number of}} people permitted to receive the service and suspensions of the service for certain periods. Failing to comply with the above rules is a crime punishable by a fine of up to $100,000. Similar provisions exist in the NPPA to enable the circulation of foreign newspapers in Singapore to be restricted. In February 1987, the Asian Wall Street Journal was declared to have engaged in domestic politics and its circulation was limited to 400 copies. The newspaper's publisher, Dow Jones Publishing Co. (Asia) Inc., applied unsuccessfully to the High Court for certiorari to quash the Minister's orders. On appeal to the Court of Appeal, Dow Jones argued that the Minister had acted irrationally and misinterpreted scope of his powers under the NPPA by not considering the right to free speech protected by Article 14(1)(a). The Court dismissed the argument on the ground that Dow Jones could not rely on the Article as it only applied to Singapore citizens. Furthermore, even if Dow Jones could raise the constitutionality of the relevant provisions of the NPPA on the basis that Singapore citizens were indirectly affected by it, it was not evident that the right to free speech included the right to receive information. In any case, even if the latter argument was accepted, it might be said that the right of Singapore citizens to receive information by reading the Asian Wall Street Journal had not been impaired since 400 copies of it were still in circulation. The Court interpreted the term domestic politics broadly, holding that in Singapore's context it included: ...|$|E
2500|$|After the Nine Network {{restarted}} broadcasting 9HD in November 2015, Ten {{confirmed that}} it was working on <b>rebroadcasting</b> Ten HD. However, they did not put a time frame on it, stating that they are [...] "working through some technical and rights issues". On 11 February 2016, some smart TVs began receiving notification messages advising of Ten HD through a [...] "ghost broadcast" [...] that soon disappeared.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2015, Radio Nova {{announced}} that it intended to seek an injunction preventing Transport Infrastructure Ireland, as operators of the Port Tunnel, from <b>rebroadcasting</b> the FM signals of 7 of its competitors. The Sunday Business Post published [...] outlining that the installed leaky coax system, designed to rebroadcast mobile and FM radio signals had limited capacity and was only able to rebroadcast 7 FM channels. Radio NOVA {{was not one of}} these channels. NOVA stated that it was suffering loss and damage on account of its signal not being available while those of its main competitors are.|$|E
2500|$|A {{large number}} of Periscope streams were used to {{broadcast}} the fight, either indirectly {{with a focus on}} reactions from viewing parties, or simply <b>rebroadcasting</b> television feeds of the fight. One stream reportedly peaked at around 10,000 viewers, although these streams had inconsistent uptime due either to connection issues or to being reported and taken down by the service. Representatives of both Meerkat and Periscope reported that they acted upon takedown notices received throughout the evening. ESPN's Ryan McGee dubbed Periscope the [...] "winner" [...] of the fight due to the prominence it received through this manner. Dick Costolo, CEO of microblogging service and Periscope parent company Twitter, made a similar remark; although it was initially assumed to be in reference to the illegal streams, he clarified that it was actually in reference to HBO's usage of the service to stream behind-the-scenes from the fighters' locker rooms.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{airing of}} [...] "Dennō Senshi Porygon", the Pokémon anime took a four-month break until it {{returned}} on April 16, 1998. After the hiatus, the time slot changed from Tuesday to Thursday. The opening theme was also redone, and black screens showing various Pokémon in spotlights were broken up into four images per screen. Before the seizure incident, the opening was originally one Pokémon image per screen. Before {{the resumption of}} broadcast, [...] was shown. Broadcast in Japan on April 11, 1998, host Miyuki Yadama went over {{the circumstances of the}} program format and the on-screen advisories at the beginning of animated programs, as well as showing letters and fan drawings sent in by viewers, most of whom were concerned that the incident would lead to the anime being cancelled. The seizures were actually caused by animation errors. After that episode aired, prior episodes with seizure-like effects were edited for <b>rebroadcasting</b> (especially the non-Japanese releases).|$|E
2500|$|The world's first {{commercial}} communications satellite, called Intelsat I and nicknamed [...] "Early Bird", was launched into geosynchronous orbit on April 6, 1965. The first {{national network of}} television satellites, called Orbita, {{was created by the}} Soviet Union in October 1967, and was based on the principle of using the highly elliptical Molniya satellite for <b>rebroadcasting</b> and delivering of television signals to a network of twenty ground downlink stations each equipped with a parabolic antenna [...] in diameter. The {{first commercial}} North American satellite to carry television transmissions was Canada's geostationary Anik 1, which was launched on 9 November 1972. ATS-6, the world's first experimental educational and Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), was launched on May 30, 1974. [...] It transmitted at 860MHz using wideband FM modulation and had two sound channels. The transmissions were focused on the Indian subcontinent but experimenters were able to receive the signal in Western Europe using home constructed equipment that drew on UHF television design techniques already in use.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 April, {{the media}} met with Carmona at Miraflores and denounced his {{decision}} to dissolve the National Assembly and arrest supporters of Chávez. Such opposition to Carmona's moves resulted in his Minister of Defense, Admiral Hector Ramirez Perez, stating that the media was [...] "opposed" [...] to Carmona's interim government. Carmona's Minister of Defense also called on the media to stop reporting the violence so it would not provoke more violent actions. The head of Globovision reportedly called to CNN in Atlanta [...] "to request the U.S. network join the blackout." [...] Venezuelan television media failed to broadcast news of Chávez supporters retaking of the Miraflores palace; the four major television networks stopped providing news reports altogether. The St. Petersburg Times reported that [...] "RCTV was showing Walt Disney cartoons. Venevisión ran a daylong marathon of Hollywood movies: Lorenzo's Oil, Nell and Pretty Woman. Another station, Televen, told its viewers 'to stay indoors,' treating them to baseball and soap operas. Globovisión, the country's top 24-hour news station and CNN affiliate, {{spent much of the}} day <b>rebroadcasting</b> upbeat footage of Chávez's ouster. An announcer repeatedly cautioned viewers, 'We are living in times of political change'" [...] while also urging viewers to remain [...] "prudent" [...] and not to spread [...] "false alarms" [...] or [...] "rumors". According to the media, such actions were performed for safety reasons since there were threats against the media organizations. Two of the three major newspapers El Universal and El Nacional cancelled their Sunday editions, for safety reasons. The third major newspaper, Últimas Noticias, printed a limited Sunday edition accurately reflecting events; some tabloids and regional television stations also covered the news. Chavez supporters on 13 April were also creating an intimidating atmosphere, attacking the offices of RCTV, breaking windows and shouting [...] "The palace is in our hands, why aren't you showing that?" [...] When CNN announced the rebellion against the coup of a key military division in Maracay (commanded by General Raúl Baduel), [...] "CNN expressed amazement that the press were saying nothing." [...] After Chávez loyalist forces had re-taken Miraflores, the military coup plotters drafted a statement demanding the restoration of democracy; it had to be read to CNN studios since no Venezuelan media would broadcast it. Only by 8 o'clock on 13 April was the reinstalled government able to inform the people of the situation, via state television channels. On 18 April, Globovision president Alberto Ravell [...] "asked for forgiveness 'from any viewer who feels we failed them that day'", further stating that [...] "Sacrificing our credibility ... and freedom of expression, we decided not to broadcast images of violence and looting.".|$|E
