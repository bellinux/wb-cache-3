Herein, we discuss methods for improving discharge protocols for these patients. We examined patients who sustained osteoporotic fractures and were operated on for a hip fracture between 2001 and 2003 (83 males and 386 females; 81. 2  ±  9. 0 years old) and between 2011 and 2013 (121 males and 462 females; 83. 1  ±  9. 3 years old). In a follow-up study, we examined patients who moved into our related <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>institution</b> over a 3 -year period, from 2011 to 2013. The incidence of hip fractures had increased from 2001 – 2003 to 2011 – 2013 in both genders, and it tended to increase in patients greater than 80 years of age in male and 90 years of age in female. The most common destination residence after discharge from the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>institution</b> was the pre-fracture place of residence.

40|$|Rehabilitering som verksemdsområde kan forståast som eit mangfaldig tverrprofesjonelt, tverretatlig, komplekst og utfordrande fagleg kryssfelt. Denne kvalitative studien ser nærare på kva utfordringar fagpersonar på rehabiliteringsfeltet skildrar i arbeidet mellom første- og andrelinjetenesta. Målet er å kaste lys over kva som faktisk skjer i spenningsfeltet mellom brukarar, fagfolk, institusjonar, fag og økonomi på rehabiliteringsfeltet. Data er henta inn gjennom tre tverrfagleg samansette fokusgruppeintervju med til saman 19 fagpersonar frå private rehabiliteringsinstitusjonar, spesialist- og kommunehelsetenesta. Funna kan indikere at: valg av rehabiliteringsarena kan vere tilfeldig, det er behov for «mellomstasjonar» mellom første og andrelinjetenesta, fagpersonane etterlyser eit felles tankegods knytt til rehabilitering og økonomi kan sjå ut til å overstyre faglege vurderingar. Studien konkluderar med at: valg av rehabiliteringsarena bør bestemmast ut frå funksjonsnivå framfor diagnose, det kan sjå ut til å vere behov for «mellomstasjonar» mellom første og andrelinjetenesta, ein fare ved å utvikle eit felles tankegods kan vere at ein misser den kimen til framdrift som ligg i at ein ser, og forstår «verda» frå ulike ståstadar og at aktørane på rehabiliteringsområdet bør ta eit felles ansvar slik at brukarane ikkje blir skadelidande på grunn av uklare ansvarsforhold.

This qualitative study looks into the challenges connected to the interaction and coordination between the primary and secondary health services as described by healthcare professionals.

Data is obtained through interviewing 19 participants from private <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>institutions,</b> primary and secondary health services, from three different interprofessional focus groups. Results indicate that: choice of rehabilitation arena can be random, that there is a need for <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>institutions</b> in between the primary and secondary health services, professionals call for a common rehabilitation philosophy and economy seems to overrule professional assessment. The study concludes that: choice of rehabilitation arena should preferably be determined by level of functioning rather than diagnosis, there seems to be a need for <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>institutions</b> in between primary and secondary health services, by developing a common rehabilitation philosophy healthcare professionals can lose the advantage of seeing and understanding the world from different perspectives, and that the professionals within the field of rehabilitation should take/share a common responsibility so that clients/users don´t end up as casualties due to unclear responsibilities.

40|$|Rationale: Stroke {{is leading}} cause of serious, {{long-term}} disability in adults. Consequently, many individuals with stroke {{are in need of}} specialized rehabilitation. However, the content of specialized rehabilitation may vary. Aims: To describe the content of specialized stroke rehabilitation, and possible influence on the physical and social functioning after specialized rehabilitation, in nine <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>institutions</b> representing seven different countries. Design: The design is a prospective, descriptive study of the specialized rehabilitation of stroke patients in <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>institutions</b> in Norway, PR China, the United States, Russia, Israel, Palestine and Sweden. Patients with a primary diagnosis of stroke consecutively attending an institution for specialized rehabilitation will be invited to enroll in the study. Study Outcomes: General descriptive data of the rehabilitation centers, the content of their programs for specialized rehabilitation for stroke patients, and descriptive data of enrolled patients will be registered. Primary outcome measures are the Barthel Index (BI), alternatively, the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), which reflect performance of the activities of daily living. Secondary outcome measures are the Life Satisfaction Scale (LISAT- 11), the Modified Rankin Scale (MRS), the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and a semistructured questionnaire with focus on the social situation. Tests will be performed on admission to rehabilitation, 18 - 22 days into rehabilitation, at discharge, six and twelve months after discharge. Discussion: The study will contribute to the knowledge about the content of specialized stroke rehabilitation with examples from nine clinics in seven different countries. The study will highlight how the different models of specialized rehabilitation may influence patients’ outcomes. Data from all sites will target what physical and psychosocial situations persons with stroke face in different settings. The international aspects of specialized stroke rehabilitation may serve as background for the discussion on the optimal rehabilitation services for stroke patients. © 2014 Langhammer B, et al.

The inverse is equally true, since, from issues encountered in the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>institutions,</b> clinical practice guides the direction of scientific activities. Other goals of the CRIR are to strengthen partnerships between the universities and the clinical community, to build a succession of future researchers through the graduate study programs and scientific activities it organizes, {{and to develop a}} research culture in the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>institutions.</b> When the first volume of the Publications du CRIR was launched just over a year ago, the Publishing Committee made a commitment to publish a second volume on the theme of traumatic brain injury (TBI). This issue currently provides very fertile ground for research and reflection among the members of our research centre. Moreover, we must not forget that this type of trauma causes high morbidity in Canada and Quebec. Progress in advanced medical technologies and the speed of emergency response have raised the life expectancies of these individuals, and have clearly made a significant impact on them and their families in the short, medium and long term. One year later, this second volume is an indicator of our efforts to respond, as well as possible, to the needs of those affected by TBI and their families. This volume is intended to disseminate the research and clinical studies on TBI that have been conducted {{under the auspices of the}} CRIR. Throughout the writing of this book, our hope was that it would bring together the interests of the diverse health care professional in the rehabilitation community, including the researchers and their students, all those who care for individuals who have sustained a TBI, the managers of the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>institutions,</b> and the trauma victims themselves, along with their families.

40|$|Conventional {{rehabilitation}} {{for people}} with physical difficulties is based on mostly a biomedical approach to health focusing on isolated {{parts of the body}} without recognizing the patients’ other needs. While more holistic and bio-psycho-social rehabilitation models have been developed, these are generally not recognized and as a result multiple needs are unlikely to be addressed. This qualitative investigation of a rehabilitation in group setting explored the experience and impact of Conductive Education and draws on a complex, person centered, bio-psycho-social rehabilitation method.
