In each age group, six animals (3 each sex) were used. The specimens of eight different skin regions were collected. They were fixed in 10 % formaldehyde solution and processed through routine paraffin embedding, cut at 5 - 7 µ and stained with H&E, Masson trichrome, Ayoub-Shklar, Verhoeff and Foot’s method for reticulum.

40|$|The immunocytochemical {{identification}} and characterization of indigenous dermal dendritic cells (dermal dendrocytes) using a rabbit polyclonal antibody to clotting enzyme factor XIII subunit A (FXIIIa) {{was carried out}} on normal and inflamed human cutaneous tissue. The immunophenotype of FXIIIa positive dendritic cells was analysed with a panel of 18 monoclonal antibodies using immunoperoxidase and double immunofluorescence staining techniques. The antibody against FXIIIa detected highly dendritic dermal cells located particularly in the upper <b>reticular</b> and papillary <b>dermis.</b> Double fluorescence microscopy showed that FXIIIa positive cells were bone marrow derived (HLe-I +) and co-expressed monocyte, macrophage or antigen presenting cell markers (HLA-DR +, LFA-I +, HLA-DQ +, OKM 5 +, MoI +, Mono-I +, Leu M 3 +). No labelling was obtained with cell markers for Langerhans cells (CDI), T lymphocytes (CD 2), granulocytes (LeuMI) fibroblasts (Te 7), intercellular adhesion molecule-I (ICAM-I) or endothelial cells (Factor VIII related antigen). Gamma interferon induced increased expression of HLA-DR and co-expression of ICAM-I on FXIIIa + dermal dendritic cells in normal skin in organ culture. Moreover, in benign inflammatory dermatoses such as atopic eczema and psoriasis there was an increased number of FXIIIa +, DR +, ICAM-I + cells in the upper dermis and foci of FXIIIa + cells in the epidermis closely associated with lymphocytes. FXIIIa positive cells in human skin represent a specific population of bone-marrow dermal dendritic cells, distinct from Langerhans cells, that share some features common to mononuclear phagocytes (monocyte/macrophages). In addition, the detection of HLA-DQ on 48 % of FXIIIa + cells {{and the lack of}} OKMI in combination with high OKM 5 expression suggests an antigen-presenting cell phenotype...|$|R
40|$|Bortezomib (BTZ), a {{selective}} proteasome inhibitor, {{is a potent}} antineoplastic drug to treat multiple myeloma. In clinical practice, a significant peripheral sensory neuropathy (PN), generally associated with impairment of Adelta and C type primary afferent fibers, represents the most significant side effect of its administration. However, the mechanisms underlying BTZ harmful effects remain still to be fully clarified. To investigate BTZ-induced neurochemical changes possibly involved in neuropathic pain development, we {{examined the effects of}} a single-dose administration of BTZ and a well-established chronic schedule in a rat model of BTZ-induced PN. At the end of treatment, the expression of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was examined in the rat L 4 -L 5 dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and intraepidermal innervation of hindlimb footpad skin. Mystacial pad skin was also examined in parallel as a territory known to be spared under BTZ treatment. In the DRGs, RT-PCR revealed a decrease of CGRP mRNA relative levels after chronic treatment. Immunohistochemistry showed that CGRP-labelled neurons were mostly small- and medium-sized and that their percent frequency increased after treatment. In the skin, both CGRP and the panneuronal marker PGP 9. 5 were used to label total cutaneous nerve fibers. On the whole, labelled nerve fibers were distributed in the <b>reticular</b> and papillary <b>dermis</b> and within the epidermal lining. In agreement with the sensory peripheral manifestions of BTZ-induced PN, the quantitative analysis of PGP 9. 5 - and CGRP-labelled intraepidermal nerve fibers revealed that the BTZ treatment induced a statistically significative decrease of the linear density of the sensory innervation. Our findings show that BTZ treatment selectively affects subsets of DRG neurons likely involved in the processing of nociceptive stimuli and that BTZ-induced neurochemical changes may contribute to development and persistence of pain in BTZ-induced PN...|$|R

Within the reticular region are the roots of the hair, sebaceous glands, sweat glands, receptors, nails, and blood vessels. The orientation of collagen fibers within the <b>reticular</b> <b>dermis</b> creates lines of tension called Langer's lines, which are of some relevance in surgery and wound healing.|$|E

They start from a plexus with the tinctorial characteristics of elaunin fibers which is connected with the thicker elastic fibers of the <b>reticular</b> <b>dermis.</b> At the electron microscopic level the oxytalan fibers are formed by bundles of tubular microfibrils 10 to 12 nm in diameter.

In the elaunin fibers the amorphous material is sparse, while in the elastic fibers it is abundant and compact." ...|$|E
50|$|Superficial fascia is the {{lowermost}} {{layer of}} the skin in {{nearly all of the}} regions of the body, that blends with the <b>reticular</b> <b>dermis</b> layer. It is present on the face, over the upper portion of the sternocleidomastoid, at the nape of the neck, and overlying the breastbone. It consists mainly of loose areolar, and fatty adipose connective tissue and is the layer that primarily determines the shape of a body. In addition to its subcutaneous presence, superficial fascia surrounds organs and glands, neurovascular bundles, and is found at many other locations where it fills otherwise unoccupied space. It serves as a storage medium of fat and water; as a passageway for lymph, nerve and blood vessels; and as a protective padding to cushion and insulate.|$|E
50|$|The dermis is {{the layer}} of skin between the {{epidermis}} and subcutaneous tissue, and comprises two sections, the papillary dermis and the <b>reticular</b> <b>dermis.</b> The superficial papillary dermis interdigitates with the overlying rete ridges of the epidermis, between which the two layers interact through the basement membrane zone.

5000|$|The dermis or corium is a {{layer of}} skin between the {{epidermis}} (with which it makes up the cutis) and subcutaneous tissues, that primarily consists of dense irregular connective tissue and cushions the body from stress and strain. It {{is divided into two}} layers, the superficial area adjacent to the epidermis called the papillary region and a deep thicker area known as the <b>reticular</b> <b>dermis.</b> [...] The dermis is tightly connected to the epidermis through a basement membrane. Structural components of the dermis are collagen, elastic fibers, and extrafibrillar matrix. It also contains mechanoreceptors that provide the sense of touch and thermoreceptors that provide the sense of heat. In addition, hair follicles, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, apocrine glands, lymphatic vessels and blood vessels are present in the dermis. Those blood vessels provide nourishment and waste removal for both dermal and epidermal cells.|$|E
50|$|Microscopically, the vesicles in lymphangioma circumscriptum {{are greatly}} dilated lymph {{channels}} {{that cause the}} papillary dermis to expand. They {{may be associated with}} acanthosis and hyperkeratosis. There are many channels in the upper dermis which often extend to the subcutis (the deeper layer of the dermis, containing mostly fat and connective tissue). The deeper vessels have large calibers with thick walls which contain smooth muscle. The lumen is filled with lymphatic fluid, but often contains red blood cells, lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. The channels are lined with flat endothelial cells. The interstitium has many lymphoid cells and shows evidence of fibroplasia (the formation of fibrous tissue). Nodules (A small mass of tissue or aggregation of cells) in cavernous lymphangioma are large, irregular channels in the <b>reticular</b> <b>dermis</b> and subcutaneous tissue that are lined by a single layer of endothelial cells. Also an incomplete layer of smooth muscle also lines the walls of these channels. The stroma consists of loose connective tissue with a lot of inflammatory cells. These tumors usually penetrate muscle. Cystic hygroma is indistinguishable from cavernous lymphangiomas on histology.|$|E
50|$|Dermabrasion {{procedures}} are surgical, invasive procedures that typically require a local anaesthetic. Often they are performed in surgical suites or in professional medical centers. Since the procedure can typically remove {{the top to}} deeper layers of the epidermis, and extend into the <b>reticular</b> <b>dermis,</b> there is always minor skin bleeding. The procedure carries risks of scarring, skin discoloration, infections, and facial herpes virus (cold sore) reactivation. In aggressive dermabrasion cases, there is often tremendous skin bleeding and spray during the procedure {{that has to be}} controlled with pressure. Afterward, the skin is normally very red and raw-looking. Depending on the level of skin removal with dermabrasion, it takes an average of 7-30 days for the skin to fully heal (re-epithelialize). Often this procedure was performed for deeper acne scarring and deep surgical scars. Dermabrasion is rarely practiced currently and there are very few doctors who are trained and still perform this surgery. Dermabrasion has largely been replaced all over the world by newer and somewhat simpler technologies including lasers, CO2 or Erbium:YAG laser. Laser technologies carry the advantage of little to no bleeding and are often less operator dependent than dermabrasion.|$|E

However, little is known concerning IGF-I in the skin of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The aim was to evaluate IGF-I immunoreactivity of skin in patients with ALS.  METHODS— IGF-I immunoreactivity of skin from 18 patients with ALS and 16 controls was examined.  RESULTS—IGF-I immunoreactivity was markedly positive in the epidermis and dermal blood vessels and glands and was moderately positive in the <b>reticular</b> <b>dermis</b> in all patients with ALS. On the other hand, the epidermis and dermal blood vessels and glands and the <b>reticular</b> <b>dermis</b> showed a weak IGF-I immunoreactivity in controls. The optical density for IGF-I immunoreactivity of the epidermis and dermal blood vessels and glands, and the <b>reticular</b> <b>dermis</b> in patients with ALS {{was significantly higher than}} in diseased controls, and was significantly increased with duration of illness.  CONCLUSIONS—These data suggest that a metabolic alteration of IGF-I may take place in the skin of patients with ALS. ...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{report on}} {{a case of a}} 65 -year-old man with {{pigmented}} clear-cell acanthoma located on the right thigh. Dermoscopy disclosed a peculiar picture consisting of diffuse black pigmentation with a superficial greyish veil in the central portion, dotted-to-globular dark red-black structures mainly located at the periphery with a homogenous regular reticular arrangement; peripheral translucid desquamation. Dermoscopic features are correlated with the histology, where hemosiderin deposits present in a sheet-like arrangement in the perivascular papillary dermis and in a band-like disposition in the <b>reticular</b> <b>dermis</b> {{at the base of the}} lesion can account for the pigmented picture. The lesion arose on a trauma-prone skin site; thus the authors believe that traumatic irritation may be responsible for the clinical and dermoscopic pictures, giving rise to a reaction similar in a way to the Auspitz′s sign provocated by trauma for psoriasis.

40|$|Vascular {{involvement}} is frequent in systemic sclerosis, but {{the role of}} the lymphatic vasculature is poorly known. Our aim was to evaluate lymphatic vessels in systemic sclerosis skin lesions. We studied skin forearm biopsies of 9 patients with systemic sclerosis and 7 age-matched controls. Lymphatic vessels were labeled with the monoclonal antibody D 2 - 40 and blood vessels with a polyclonal antibody to von Willebrand Factor. All blood and lymphatic vessels present in each section were counted and total area, inner luminal area, and shape factors were measured. The number of blood and lymphatic vessels in papillary dermis was greater and their diameter lower than in <b>reticular</b> <b>dermis</b> both in systemic sclerosis and controls. In the <b>reticular</b> <b>dermis,</b> the number of lymphatic vessels was markedly reduced in systemic sclerosis (4. 9 +/- 1. 1 microm(- 2) versus 8. 9 +/- 1. 2 microm(- 2) P =. 03), and a similar trend was observed in papillary dermis (8. 4 +/- 3. 7 microm(- 2) versus 8. 1 +/- 5. 3 microm(- 2)). Interestingly, the number of periglandular lymphatics in systemic sclerosis was not different from controls. The inner luminal area (possibly indicating compensatory dilation) of lymphatic vessels, particularly the periglandular ones, was greater in systemic sclerosis than in controls. No differences were observed in the number of blood vessels, but the percentage of blood vessel profiles (without lumen) was significantly less in systemic sclerosis both in papillary and in <b>reticular</b> <b>dermis.</b> In conclusion, our data show that skin lesions in systemic sclerosis are characterized by a selective rarefaction of lymphatic vasculature that spares periglandular vessels and that might have a pathogenic role in the evolution and in the clinical manifestations of the disease...|$|E
