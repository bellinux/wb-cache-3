40|$|Piglet {{survival}} is of importance because {{it affects the}} farmer’s economy and {{the welfare of the}} pigs. There are several factors affecting piglet survival and they are often linked to each other. This paper will focus on how the behaviour of the sow can affect the growth and survival of the piglets and also possible causations of differences in maternal behaviour. Sows in intensive production systems have different possibilities to express their maternal behaviour than free <b>ranging</b> <b>sows.</b> They often live in small pens or crates, have fewer choices because of the restricted environment and are depended on human provided resources. One of the major problems in piglet production is that piglets are crushed by the sow and then dies from traumatic injury or suffocation. Sow behaviour when she lies down or when she has a piglet under her body affects the mortality and the risk of injures on piglets. Also, sow behaviour during farrowing can affect piglet survival in a positive or negative way. There are differences in nursing patterns between sows. The variation in maternal behaviour between sows can therefore be of interest, in order {{to find a way to}} reduce piglet mortality and increase growth...|$|R

A crop model was developed for 7 cultivars from diverse origins to identify if photoperiod sensitivity is involved in determining phenological development, {{and if that is}} advantageous in avoiding low-temperature damage. Cultivars that were mildly photoperiod-sensitive were identified from sowing to flowering and from panicle initiation to flowering. The crop models were run for 47 years of temperature data to quantify the risk of encountering low temperature during the critical young microspore stage for 5 different sowing dates. Cultivars that were mildly photoperiod-sensitive, such as Amaroo, had a reduced likelihood of encountering low temperature for a wider <b>range</b> of <b>sowing</b> dates compared with photoperiod-insensitive cultivars. The benefits of increased photoperiod sensitivity include greater sowing flexibility and reduced water use as growth duration is shortened when sowing is delayed. Determining the optimal sowing date also requires other considerations, e. g. the risk of cold damage at other sensitive stages such as flowering and the response of yield to a delay in flowering under non-limiting conditions. It was concluded that appropriate sowing time and the use of photoperiod-sensitive cultivars can be advantageous in the Riverina region in avoiding low temperature damage during reproductive development...|$|R
40|$|Crop {{models have}} become {{valuable}} tools for designing efficient cropping systems, particularly once model reliability is documented {{for a given}} environment. For this use, the timing of crop phenology has to be accurately simulated to predict life cycle and the correct allocation of assimilates to yield components. The CROPGRO-Fababean model was developed based on adaptation of the generic CROPGRO legume model to simulate faba bean grown in Cordoba, Spain (Boote et al., 2002) but the model has not been tested extensively in other environments. Therefore, the model needs {{to be tested for}} additional environments, and may need to be modified to improve its reliability under a wide range of field conditions.

To cope with the changing scenarios, adoption of appropriate management strategies is of paramount importance. A study was undertaken to evaluate the most appropriate combination of sowing date and phosphorus fertilization level for peanut crops grown in sandy loam soil in a subhumid region of eastern India. Field experiments were conducted during the summer seasons of 2012 and 2013 on peanut crops at the farm of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. The DSSAT v 4. 5 CROPGRO-Peanut model was used to predict the phenology, growth, and yield of peanut crop under combinations of four sowing dates and four phosphorus fertilization levels.

Difficulties encountered by selected models such as CERES-sorghum and STICS to simulate crop development {{may result from}} the representation of sorghum response to daylength during the photoperiod inductive phase. Four modeling approaches combining two temperature and photoperiod responses (linear, hyperbolic) and two calculation methods for development rates (cumulative, threshold) were evaluated to simulate time to panicle initiation (PI) in highly photoperiod sensitive Guinea sorghum variety CSM 388. In the cumulative method, development rates were computed as summations of daily photothermal ratios, whereas in the threshold method accumulated degree days were tested against thermal time requirement to PI modulated by current photoperiod. Each model was calibrated based on observations from a Sotuba, Mali (12 ° 39 ′N) planting date experiment spanning a 2 -month period in 1996. Observed time from emergence to PI decreased from 54 to 22 days for a 20 min variation in daylength.

Numerical experiments {{based on the}} modelling of these early stages in relation to major environmental factors at sowing were used as a powerful tool to browse {{the effects of the}} genetic diversity of Medicago truncatula, one of the model legume species, under a range of agronomic scenarios, and to highlight the most important plant parameters for emergence. To this end, the emergence of several genotypes of M. truncatula was simulated under a <b>range</b> of <b>sowing</b> conditions with a germination and emergence simulation model. Methods After testing the predictive quality of the model by comparing simulations to field observations of several genotypes of M. truncatula, numerical experiments were performed under a wide range of environmental conditions (sowing dates x years x seedbed structure). Germination and emergence was simulated for a set of five genotypes previously parameterized and for two virtual genotypes engineered to maximize the potential effects of genetic diversity. Key Results The simulation results gave an average value of 5 - 10 % difference in final emergence between genotypes, which was low, but the analysis underlined considerable inter-annual variation. The effects of parameters describing germination and emergence processes were quantified and ranked according to their contribution to the variation in emergence. Seedling non-emergence was mainly related to mechanical obstacles (40 - 50 %). More generally, plant parameters that accelerated the emergence time course significantly contributed to limiting the risk of soil surface crusting occurring before seedling emergence. Conclusions The model-assisted analysis of the effects of genetic diversity demonstrated its usefulness in helping to identify the parameters which have most influence that could be improved by breeding programmes.

Weed management can be difficult in lentil because of its poor early growth and the limited range of safe selective post-emergent herbicides available. Experiments were conducted at Minlaton, South Australia, and Horsham, Victoria, {{to examine the effects}} of early vigour on the ability of lentil to compete against a broadleaf weed. Early growth in lentil was manipulated by selecting genotypes with different levels of early vigour and by using a <b>range</b> of <b>sowing</b> rates. Canola (Brassica napus cv. Beacon) was used to mimic the growth of a cruciferous weed and it was sown at 0, 0. 25 (Minlaton only), 0. 5, 1 or 2 kg/ha. Lentil genotypes were selected that represented the range in early vigour currently available within the breeding program. Another experiment examined the effect of plant density of lentils with different degrees of early vigour on the yield of canola. Grain yield of lentil declined as the density of canola increased. The initial reduction in canola yield over sites was about 4 %/plant. m 2, but was as high as 12 %/plant. m 2 in one treatment. This yield loss is similar to that reported for other grain legume crops, but is much higher than the initial yield loss reported for wheat. The differences in early vigour between genotypes were insufficient to affect the competitive ability of lentil. In contrast, increasing the sowing rate of lentil significantly reduced canola grain yield and increased lentil grain yield. When the density of canola was low (10 plants/m 2), doubling the lentil plant density to 200 plants/m 2 limited the yield loss to 10 %. The results suggest the level of variation in early vigour among the present genotypes is insufficient to increase the competitive ability of the crop. Increasing the plant population of lentil is a more effective means of suppressing weed growth and increasing grain yield. G. K. McDonald, K. L. Hollaway, and L. McMurra...|$|R

High parent heterosis in Hyno Esta over a <b>range</b> of <b>sowing</b> densities was mostly exhibited in total biomass but also, {{in one of two}} years, in harvest index. High parent heterosis in Hyno Renta was associated more with harvest index than with biomass.

Respiration rates (breaths/min) were collected on 50 sows (control, n = 25; SH, n = 25) over an 8 -wk period when the maximum temperature exceeded 32 °C. Ten milliliters of clotted blood and 20 mL of whole blood were obtained by jugular puncture from each sow on the day of weaning to determine total white blood cells, acute phase proteins, packed-cell volume, and chemotaxis and chemokinesis. Descriptive water temperature profiles were measured by using data loggers positioned at 3 levels per wallow: surface water, shallow mud, and deep mud. Behavioral, postural, location, performance, and physiological measurements did not differ (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) among wallow treatments. Regardless of treatment, sows spent approximately 82...|$|R

Euphytica, 142 (1 - 2), 149 - 159 Heterosis in hybrid wheat varieties produced using a chemical hybridising agent was assessed in field experiments. Hyno Esta and its parents were compared in factorial combinations of four-seed rates (25 ? 300 seeds m? 2) and two nitrogen fertilizer rates (0 and 200 kg N ha? 1) in 2001 / 02 {{and again in}} 2002 / 03. Hyno Rista and Hyno Renta and their parents were compared at two-seed rates in 2001 / 02. Hyno Rista and its parents were added factorially to the Hyno Esta experiment in 2002 / 03, while Hyno Renta and Hybred and their parents were compared at two seed rates in 2002 / 03. Mid parent heterosis for grain yield was found in three hybrids and two of these showed high parent heterosis. High parent heterosis in Hyno Esta over a <b>range</b> of <b>sowing</b> densities was mostly exhibited in total biomass but also, {{in one of two}} years, in harvest index. High parent heterosis in Hyno Renta was associated more with harvest index than with biomass. The heterosis for biomass in Hyno Esta resulted from greater interception of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) than the male parent, with better radiation use efficiency than the female parent. In both seasons Hyno Esta achieved grain numbers per ear at least as high as the high parent for this trait (Audace), and combined this with mean grain weights at least as heavy as the high parent for mean grain weight (Estica). Much of the increased biomass and grain yield in the hybrid came late in the season as high parent heterosis was expressed for both maximum grain filling rate and grain filling duration. Heterosis was higher when nitrogen was applied than when withheld; only greater at lower seed rates when expressed in proportionate terms (e. g. {{as a percentage of the}} parents), rather than in absolute terms (e. g. t ha? 1); and greater in the year with the cooler and wetter summer.

40|$|Sows {{are often}} {{selected}} by their body size and gestation groups are formed from this initial selection. However, size of sow {{and rate of}} feeding speed have not been determined, and instead of body size as the selection criteria, would rate of feeding be a better determinant for sows being grouped? Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to (1) estimate the range of speeds that a sow consumes a pre determined ration, (2) determine how sow parity affects the rate of feeding and (3) ascertain if feeding rate differs when feed is presented on the floor versus a raised ledge. To avoid aggression, 11 clinically normal, mixed-parity, crossbred sows were purchased from a commercial producer in Iowa and housed in individual pens at Iowa State University. Sows were all feed by hand and the ration was formulated to meet the NRC (1998) requirements for that sow at her stage of production. Data was collected on the afternoon feeding (1600 h) and each sow received 0. 90 kg (2 lb). Treatment One; Floor; defined as food being placed centrally 1 m in distance on the rubber mat from the back of the home pen. Treatment Two; Ledge; the ledge was defined as a raised concrete step. Scoring of feeding rate was conducted by live observation (one person to one sow). Data were analyzed using the PROC MIXED procedure of SAS and a repeated measure statement of date nested within sow was used. A P 3 ̆c 0. 05 was considered significant and PDIFF was used to separate the means. The feeding rate (sec) <b>range</b> for <b>sows</b> within parity will be presented descriptively. No differences were found for parity (P = 0. 59) of sow, although parity one sows ate quicker (14 mins) compared to parities two (20 mins) and three (19 mins). There was a difference (P = 0. 02) for rate of feeding when sows were presented with feed on the floor of their home pen or on the raised feeder. In conclusion there was no difference between rates of feeding by parity when sows were housed individually in a home pen. However, when feed was presented on the floor the sows ate more quickly compared to a raised ledge...|$|R
40|$|Remote sensing {{offers a}} {{low-cost}} method for developing spatially continuous crop production statistics across large areas and through time. Nevertheless, {{it has been}} difficult to characterize the production of individual smallholder farms, given that the land-holding size in most areas of South Asia (< 2 ha) is smaller than the spatial resolution of most freely available satellite imagery, like Landsat and MODIS. In addition, existing methods to map yield require field-level data to develop and parameterize predictive algorithms that translate satellite vegetation indices to yield, yet these data are costly or difficult to obtain in many smallholder systems. To overcome these challenges, this study explores two issues. First, we employ new high spatial (2 m) and temporal (bi-weekly) resolution micro-satellite SkySat data to map sowing dates and yields of smallholder wheat fields in Bihar, India in the 2014 – 2015 and 2015 – 2016 growing seasons. Second, we compare how well we predict sowing date and yield when using ground data, like crop cuts and self-reports, versus using crop models, which require no on-the-ground data, to develop and parameterize prediction models. Overall, sow dates were predicted well (R 2 = 0. 41 in 2014 – 2015 and R 2 = 0. 62 in 2015 – 2016), particularly when using models that were parameterized using self-report sow dates collected close to the time of planting and when using imagery that spanned the entire growing season. We were also able to map yields fairly well (R 2 = 0. 27 in 2014 – 2015 and R 2 = 0. 33 in 2015 – 2016), with crop cut parameterized models resulting in the highest accuracies. While less accurate, we were able to capture the large <b>range</b> in <b>sow</b> dates and yields across farms when using models parameterized with crop model data and these estimates were able to detect known relationships between management factors (e. g., sow date, fertilizer, and irrigation) and yield. While these results are specific to our study site in India, {{it is likely that the}} methods employed and the lessons learned are applicable to smallholder systems more generally across the globe. This is of particular interest given that similar high spatio-temporal resolution micro-satellite data will become increasingly available in the coming years...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the behavior of some high oleic sun-flower hybrids towards the race of Plasmopara halstedii present in the envi-ronment and to analyze the main climatic factors affecting development and spread of the disease in order to draw up the basis for a prediction model of disease incidence. The race was determined by means of artificial infection of differential inbred lines in a growth chamber experiment and a field trial was also done to study the effects of the factors genotype, sowing time and seed dressing on the infection percentage of P. halstedii during different sunflower growing stages. The Pl genes responsible for resistance to race 700, detected in the trial area and named according to the international code, were absent in all the high oleic hybrids studied, which, however, manifested a partial resistance to downy mildew, probably due to the partial polygenic, non-qualitative and non-specific resistance to the race detected. Seed treatment with metalaxyl helped to limit the severity of P. halstedii attack to 5 % of plants infected, but with a maximum of 19. 6 % in the susceptible check. Concerning the environ-mental conditions, water availability did not result as being limiting for the infection, whereas the most favorable mean air temperatures during the 5 days following <b>sowing</b> <b>ranged</b> from 10 to 15 °C.

40|$|Early {{growth is}} a {{critical}} phase of the crop cycle, which lasts from emergence {{to the beginning of}} competition between plants and is sensitive to sowing conditions and species characteristics. Providing tools to improve the management of this critical phase in intercrops is a challenge for agroecology as these cropping systems are the subject of renewed interest for their ability to maintain yields while requiring fewer inputs. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate variations in early growth under different sowing conditions in different species with contrasted seed and seedling characteristics (seed mass, hypogeal or epigeal emergence, and legume and non-legume species), especially species used as intercrops. Experiments were carried out in glasshouses using different sowing depths and levels of mineral nutrition, first for each species separately, then in mixed sowings. In the first set of experiments, biomass at emergence and relative growth rate after emergence were measured and then modelled as a function of seed mass, mineral nutrition, and time to emergence. Predictive equations were tested by comparing simulations with biomass measured in the second set of experiments, for two intercrops grown under varied sowing conditions. Finally, simulations were run to analyse variations in the early growth of two intercrops (durum wheat/pea or alfalfa) under a wider <b>range</b> of <b>sowing</b> conditions (seed mass, sowing depth, and with or without mineral nutrition). Biomass at emergence was positively correlated with seed mass, and in epigeal species, was also negatively impacted by time to emergence. Relative growth rate was highly stimulated by mineral nutrition whereas its response to time to emergence varied among species. The amount of seminal reserves at emergence (in hypogeal species) and the cotyledon specific mass (in epigeal species) were correlated with the establishment of the relative growth rate. When evaluated, the model was shown to satisfactorily predict the early growth of two intercrops. Used as a simulation tool, the model indicated that all the sowing techniques tested can have a major influence on total biomass and on the proportion of each component species when competition begins. This model can thus contribute to the management of sowing techniques for sole as well as combined crops whose effects are difficult to predict and are also difficult to analyse from field experiments alone because of the number of possible combinations and interaction...|$|R
40|$|Sowing {{date and}} {{cultivar}} choice influence yield of wheat in Mediterranean climatic regions where crop production is constrained by waterlogging in winter on clay soils and terminal water deficit in spring. Because {{of the large}} seasonal variability in Mediterranean environments, a combination of experimental data and simulation results were used to investigate optimal sowing date and cultivar choice. The Agricultural Production Systems SIMulator (APSIM), which had been rigorously tested for bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in Mediterranean-type environments, was further tested with measured durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum) experimental data from the Mediterranean basin. The model reproduced most of the observed seasonal variability of grain yields but tended to overestimate, particularly some of the observed low grain yields. Comparing the model with detailed field experiments from two seasons and three durum wheat cultivars over a wide <b>range</b> of <b>sowing</b> dates highlighted the importance of reproducing the measured phenology and in particularly the observed anthesis dates for the general performance of the model. The use of a specific phyllochron for each sowing date instead of a single value per cultivar regardless of sowing date, as in APSIM, improved anthesis predictions {{and other aspects of}} the model. Hence, the phyllochron was varied in the model through a simple relationship based on observed phyllochrons and sowing dates. The new phyllochron routine was then used to explore management options to increase yields by combining the model with 47 years of historical weather records from Oristano, Sardinia, Italy. The simulation results showed that sowing wheat before December can result in higher yields in the absence of waterlogging. However, the high frequency of waterlogging on the clay soils, even with the observed decline of rainfall in the last 20 years in winter, showed no average yield advantage of sowing before December. Early maturing cultivars outperformed late cultivars at standard and late sowing dates. Hence, sowing early cultivars as soon as rainfall has started from December onwards is currently proposed to give the best yields in this environment in most seasons. Increasing temperatures and declining rainfalls in all months of the year as a consequence of future climate change projections will substantially reduce grain yields. Under such conditions, sowing as early as October to avoid terminal water shortage and heat stress will minimise the negative impact from climate change...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} rainfall patterns on the water-use efficiency of wheat in a transect between Horsham (36 ◦S) and Emerald (23 ◦S) in eastern Australia. Water-use efficiency was {{defined in terms of}} biomass and transpiration, WUEB/T, and grain yield and evapotranspiration, WUEY/ET. Our working hypothesis is that latitudinal trends in WUEY/ET of water-limited crops are the complex result of southward increasing WUEB/T and soil evaporation, and season-dependent trends in harvest index. Our approach included: (a) analysis of long-term records to establish latitudinal gradients of amount, seasonality, and size-structure of rainfall; and (b) modelling wheat development, growth, yield, water budget components, and derived variables includingWUEB/T andWUEY/ET. Annual median rainfall declined from around 600 mm in northern locations to 380 mm in the south. Median seasonal rain (from sowing to harvest) doubled between Emerald and Horsham, whereas median off-season rainfall (harvest to <b>sowing)</b> <b>ranged</b> from 460 mm at Emerald to 156 mm at Horsham. The contribution of small events (≤ 5 mm) to seasonal rainfall was negligible at Emerald (median 15 mm) and substantial at Horsham (105 mm). Power law coefficients (τ), i. e. the slopes of the regression between size and number of events in a log-log scale, captured the latitudinal gradient characterised by an increasing dominance of small events from north to south during the growing season. Median modelled WUEB/T increased from 46 kg/ha. mm at Emerald to 73 kg/ha. mm at Horsham, in response to decreasing atmospheric demand. Median modelled soil evaporation during the growing season increased from 70 mm at Emerald to 172 mm at Horsham. This was explained by the size-structure o...|$|R
