Former Congressman Christopher Cox (of Newport Beach), a White House counsel for President Ronald <b>Reagan,</b> <b>is</b> also {{a former chairman of}} the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Orange County was also home to former Republican Congressman John G.

In 1996, Curt Pringle (later Mayor of Anaheim) became the first Republican-elected Speaker of the California State Assembly in decades.|$|E
25|$|Robert Bork's America {{is a land}} {{in which}} women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at {{segregated}} lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the Government, and {{the doors of the}} Federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens for whom the judiciary is—and is often the only—protector of the individual rights that are the heart of our democracy... President <b>Reagan</b> <b>is</b> still our president. But he should not be able to reach out from the muck of Irangate, reach into the muck of Watergate and impose his reactionary vision of the Constitution on the Supreme Court and the next generation of Americans. No justice would be better than this injustice.|$|E

500|$|Reagan's {{policies}} {{proposed that}} economic growth would occur when marginal tax rates were {{low enough to}} spur investment, which would then lead to higher employment and wages. Critics labeled this [...] "trickle-down economics"—the belief that tax policies that benefit the wealthy will create a [...] "trickle-down" [...] effect to the poor. Questions arose whether Reagan's policies benefited the wealthy more than those living in poverty, and many poor and minority citizens viewed Reagan as indifferent to their struggles. These views were exacerbated {{by the fact that}} Reagan's economic regimen included freezing the minimum wage at $3.35 an hour, slashing federal assistance to local governments by 60%, cutting the budget for public housing and Section 8 rent subsidies in half, and eliminating the antipoverty Community Development Block Grant program. The widening gap between the rich and poor had already begun during the 1970s before Reagan's economic policies took effect. Along with Reagan's 1981 cut in the top regular tax rate on unearned income, he reduced the maximum capital gains rate to 20%. Reagan later set tax rates on capital gains at the same level as the rates on ordinary income like salaries and wages, with both topping out at 28%. <b>Reagan</b> <b>is</b> viewed as an antitax hero despite raising taxes eleven times {{over the course of his}} presidency, all in the name of fiscal responsibility. According to Paul Krugman, [...] "Over all, the 1982 tax increase undid about a third of the 1981 cut; as a share of GDP, the increase was substantially larger than Mr.Clinton's 1993 tax increase." [...] According to historian and domestic policy adviser Bruce Bartlett, Reagan's tax increases over the course of his presidency took back half of the 1981 tax cut.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{confirmation}} of Neil Gorsuch in 2017, the Court consists of five justices appointed by Republican presidents and four appointed by Democratic presidents. It is popularly accepted that Chief Justice Roberts and associate justices Thomas and Alito (appointed by Republican presidents) comprise the Court's conservative wing. Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan (appointed by Democratic presidents) comprise the Court's liberal wing. Justice Kennedy (appointed by President <b>Reagan)</b> <b>is</b> generally considered [...] "a conservative who has occasionally voted with liberals", and up until Justice Scalia's death, he was often the swing vote that determined the outcome of cases divided between the conservative and liberal wings. Gorsuch had a track record as a reliably conservative judge in the 10th circuit.|$|E
2500|$|Then-movie star Ronald Reagan {{had moved}} to {{television}} as the host and a frequent performer for General Electric Theater during 1954. <b>Reagan</b> <b>was</b> later fired by General Electric in 1962 {{in response to his}} publicly referring to the TVA (TVA being a major customer for GE turbines) as one of the problems of [...] "big government". Some claim that <b>Reagan</b> <b>was</b> instead fired due to a criminal antitrust investigation involving him and the Screen Actors Guild. However, <b>Reagan</b> <b>was</b> only interviewed; nobody was actually charged with anything in the investigation.|$|R

2500|$|An {{icon of the}} American {{conservative}} movement, <b>Reagan</b> <b>is</b> credited by {{his supporters}} with transforming {{the politics of the}} United States, galvanizing the success of the Republican Party. He brought together a coalition of economic conservatives, who supported his supply side economics; foreign policy conservatives, who favored his staunch opposition to Communism and the Soviet Union; and social conservatives, who identified with his religious and social ideals. Reagan labeled the Soviet Union the [...] "evil empire." [...] Conservatives also supported the Reagan Doctrine, under which the U.S. provided military and other aid to insurgency movements resisting governments aligned with the Soviet Union. For these and other efforts, Reagan was attacked by liberals at the time as a dangerous warmonger, but conservative historians assert that he decisively won the Cold War.|$|E
2500|$|In 1982, Nakasone became Prime Minister. Along with Minister of Foreign Affairs Shintaro Abe, Nakasone {{improved}} Japan's {{relations with}} the USSR and the People's Republic of China. Nakasone was {{best known for his}} close relationship with U.S. President Ronald Reagan, popularly called the [...] "Ron-Yasu" [...] friendship. Nakasone sought a more equal relationship with America, and said: [...] "President <b>Reagan</b> <b>is</b> the pitcher and I'm the catcher. When the pitcher gives the signs, I'll co-operate unsparingly, but if he doesn't sometimes follow the catcher's signs, the game can't be won". Nakasone said Japan would be [...] "America's unsinkable aircraft carrier" [...] in the Pacific and that Japan would [...] "keep complete control of the four straits that go through to Japanese islands, to prevent the passage of Soviet submarines". He was attacked by political opponents as a reactionary and a [...] "dangerous militarist". Nakasone responded by saying [...] "A nation must shed any sense of ignominy and move forward seeking glory". However his attempt to amend Article 9 failed.|$|E
2500|$|The League of Women Voters had {{announced}} {{a schedule of}} debates similar to 1976, three presidential and one vice presidential. No one had {{much of a problem}} with this until it was announced that Rep. John Anderson might be invited to participate along with Carter and Reagan. Carter steadfastly refused to participate with Anderson included, and Reagan refused to debate without him. It took months of negotiations for the League of Women Voters to finally put it together. It was held on September 21, 1980 in the Baltimore Convention Center. Reagan said of Carter's refusal to debate: [...] "He [...] knows that he couldn't win a debate even if it were held in the Rose Garden before an audience of Administration officials with the questions being asked by Jody Powell." [...] The League of Women Voters promised the Reagan campaign that the debate stage would feature an empty chair to represent the missing president. Carter was very upset about the planned chair stunt, and at the last minute convinced the League to take it out. The debate was moderated by Bill Moyers. Anderson, who many thought would handily dispatch the former Governor, managed only a draw, according to many in the media at that time. The Illinois congressman, who had been as high as 20% in some polls, and {{at the time of the}} debate was over 10%, dropped to about 5% soon after. Anderson failed to substantively engage Reagan, instead he started off by criticizing Carter: [...] "Governor <b>Reagan</b> <b>is</b> not responsible for what has happened over the last four years, nor am I. The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend," [...] to which Reagan added: [...] "It's a shame now that there are only two of us here debating, because the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement." [...] In one moment in the debate, Reagan commented on a rumor that Anderson had invited Senator Ted Kennedy to be his running mate by asking the candidate directly, [...] "John, would you really prefer Teddy Kennedy to me?" ...|$|E
