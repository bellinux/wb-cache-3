50|$|The koff {{had been}} {{developed}} in the late 17th century in the Netherlands. Smaller than the fluyt, its <b>rounded</b> <b>bow</b> and stern provided however for more storage on board. This made it a popular type that saw increasing service.|$|R
25|$|Most {{letters are}} {{constructed}} {{by a combination}} of two basic shapes: a vertical stem (either long or short) and either one or two <b>rounded</b> <b>bows</b> (which {{may or may not be}} underscored, and may be on the left or right of the stem).|$|R
60|$|Charlie's {{progress}} was now comparatively easy. A few vigorous strokes brought {{him under the}} lea of the wreck, which, however, {{was by no means}} a quiet spot, for each divided wave, rushing <b>round</b> <b>bow</b> and stern, met there in a tumult of foam that almost choked the swimmer, while each billow that burst over the wreck poured a small Niagara on his head.|$|E
50|$|Its body is {{made out}} of a {{calabash}} or wood which is covered by animal skin. The strings are made from horse hair and are connected near the neck, and runs over a two-part bridge. The <b>round</b> <b>bow</b> is also equipped with horse hair.|$|E
50|$|The {{ship was}} about 20 meters {{in length and}} {{displaced}} between 60 and 100 tons. The ratio of length to beam was between 2.5:1 and 4.5:1, which made for a relatively nimble ship, though still sufficiently stable to be seaworthy. It was a round-bilged keel ship with a <b>round</b> <b>bow</b> and stern, the latter relatively high, and with a gallery. The broad deck provided space to process the catch on board.|$|E

50|$|The {{exterior}} {{design of}} the Bohème/Freewinds {{is very similar to}} the Finnhansa class ships built as ferries. She has a moderately raked and slightly <b>rounded</b> <b>bow,</b> <b>rounded</b> forward superstructure, terraced rear superstructure and two slim side-by-side funnels. She differs from her sisters with the superstructure expanding further on promenade deck (on the other ships it only extends as far as the bridge), swimming pool added to the rear of promenade deck, and the observation lounge missing from the topmost deck; this was replaced by an open sunbathing area.|$|R
25|$|In another {{variation}} of the <b>rounded</b> <b>bow</b> fibula, the bow became fat and swollen-looking. In many of these Leech Bow, or Sanguisaga, fibulae the catch plate became large and triangular. Another variant, the Certossa type, had a small square or ribbon cross-section bow and a short bilateral spring (possibly the first use of a bilateral spring). Certossa fibulae are almost always very small.|$|R

50|$|HMS Lyme was a 28-gun, sixth-rate frigate of the Royal Navy. Originally ordered as a 24 gun ship to {{the draft}} of the French {{privateer}} Tyger. The sixth vessel of the Royal Navy to bear the name, Lyme, as well as , which was a near-sister, were the first true frigates built for the Royal Navy. They were actually completed with 28 guns including the four smaller weapons on the quarterdeck, but the latter {{were not included in}} the ships official establishment until 22 September 1756. The two ships differed in detail, Unicorn having a beakhead bow, a unicorn figurehead, two-light quarter galleries and only five pairs of quarterdeck gunports, while Lyme had a <b>round</b> <b>bow,</b> a lion figurehead, three-light quarter galleries and six pairs of quarterdeck gunports.|$|E
5000|$|Mintos {{design was}} based on CGS Stanley, Canada's {{previously}} constructed icebreaker. Minto was larger and had no bowsprit and a <b>rounded</b> <b>bow.</b> Minto was intended to augment Stanley in servicing Prince Edward Island. The ship had a gross register tonnage (GRT) of 1,089 tons and was 225 ft long overall with a beam of 32.5 ft and a draught of 20.5 ft.|$|R
50|$|The {{critical}} detail for the péniche is the dimension, 38.50m (126 ft) {{long and}} 5.05 m wide. They were especially {{designed for the}} Belgian and French canal locks, {{and as a result}} of the wish to maximise space for freight, the barges tend to be flat-sided, with short, <b>rounded</b> <b>bows</b> and sterns. Nowadays the specification is still applied for commercial navigation as Class I in the Classification of European Inland Waterways.|$|R
25|$|The {{second major}} design of fibulae has a high, rounded arch (bogen in German) {{instead of the}} low flat arch of the violin bow fibula. At first, the bow was thin. In later {{variants}} the bow was made of thicker metal or of two pieces of thin wire twisted together. These <b>rounded</b> <b>bow</b> fibulae were first found in the 12th century BC, but lasted in use in some places {{for more than five}} centuries.|$|R
5000|$|Polar Sea has {{sufficient}} hull {{strength to}} absorb the high-powered ice ramming common to her operations. The shell plating and associated internal support structure are fabricated from steel with superior low-temperature strength. The portion of the hull designed to ram ice is 1¾ inches thick (44 mm) in the bow and stern sections, and 1¼ inches thick (32 mm) amidships. The hull strength is produced almost entirely from a sophisticated internal support structure that features [...] ribs for approximately the forward two-thirds of the ship's frame. Polar Sea's hull shape is designed to maximize icebreaking by efficiently combining {{the forces of the}} ship's forward motion, the downward pull of gravity on the bow, and the upward push of the inherent buoyancy of the stern. The curved bow and heavy weight allows Polar Sea to force ice edges to break off downward as cusps. Contrary to some myths, this design does not use sharp edges or hammer-like blows to cut or break the ice, as the <b>round</b> <b>bow</b> and massive weight are sufficient. With high power to back it up, the 13,000-ton (13,200-metric ton) Polar Sea is able to continuously progress through 6 feet (1.8 m) of new hard ice at 3 knots (6 km/h) and break up to 21 feet when using back-and-ram methods.|$|E
40|$|Drugu godinu zaredom provedena su probna arheološka istraživanja prapovijesnog groblja Glavičice. Istražen je najjužniji tumul 6 pod kojim su se nalazila dva paljevinska groba u vertikalnom stratigrafskom odnosu. Prilozi u grobovima ukazuju da su pokojnici pokopani početkom željeznog doba (Ha C 1 a) spajajući tradiciju paljevinskog pokopavanja kulture polja sa žarama s halštatskom modom – označavanjem groba nasipom tumula. For {{the second}} year, archaeological trial {{excavations}} of the Glavičice prehistoric cemetery in Dolina were conducted. The southernmost Tumulus 6 was excavated, under {{which there were}} two incineration graves in a vertical stratigraphic relationship. The grave goods suggest that the deceased were buried {{at the beginning of}} the Iron Age (Ha C 1 a), thus connecting the tradition of cremation burials of the Urnfield culture with the Hallstatt fashion of marking graves by erecting tumuli. Under a mound of grey mixed earth in the south-western quarter of the tumulus, incineration remains of a rectangular shape with a large amount of soot were identified as Grave 1. It was constructed with four wooden pillars in the corners, along which planks were probably laid. In the grave, thus prepared, a pot was laid – an urn with the incinerated bones of the deceased, among which an iron wire double-looped fibula was unearthed with a triangular foot and a <b>round</b> <b>bow</b> cross-section. The fibula is relatively small. In the urn-pot, an iron bead was found, along with small bronze rivets of 0. 5 cm in diameter. The urn was covered with the remains of a funeral pyre with soot, among which incinerated bones, pottery shards, a large amount of small bronze rivets, fragments of a burned iron artefact, two bone pendants, one of which was decorated with concentric circles, and a stone pendant which had deliberately been broken in three parts, were found. Grave 1 was sunk in the mound of Grave 2. Finds in Grave 1, Tumulus 6 suggest a burial of a prominent person from the beginning of the Early Iron Age. The incineration burial partly in the urn and partly in the rest of the grave testifies to the traditions of the Urnfield culture. In the grave, a whetstone was unearthed, frequently encountered in graves at Dalj and Batina (Metzner-Nebelsick 2002 : T. 6 : 26 passim). The find from Grave 1 of Tumulus 6 might be the currently westernmost known find of this type of whetstone, associated with eastern, so-called Thraco-Cimmerian, influences. Another extraordinary find is that of a double-looped iron fibula with a triangular foot and a bow with a round cross-section of the type 2 a based on Gabrovec, for which there are close analogies in Grave 250 in Ljubljana (Gabrovec 1970 : 24, Map V, T. 8 : 8). The densest distribution of this type of fibulae has been documented in Slovenia (Lower Carniola, Ljubljana, Inner Carniola). However, isolated finds are also known from Glasinci and Vukovar (Gabrovec 1970 : map V) and the find from Dolina fits well into this picture. Particularly interesting is the find of approximately one hundred small bronze rivets of 0. 5 cm in diameter, which formed a constituent part of the attire or equipment of the deceased, and were cremated along with them. They can be interpreted in two ways: a part of their attire (belt, mantle or waistcoat) decorated with rivets, or a bowl-shaped helmet of the Libna group (Škoberne 1999 : 88, Fig. 59 – 60). The iron fibula and the presumed bowl-shaped helmet from Grave 1 testify to western influences, while the ceramic vessels, whetstone and bone pendants suggest eastern connections, which is not surprising considering the geographical position of Dolina in the Sava valley, a transversal between the south-eastern Alps and Danube region. The Grave 2 mound was made of brown sandy earth, and is situated in the central part of the grave, in its south-eastern and south-western quarters. Grave 2 was placed in the southern part of the tumulus. Incinerated bones mixed with pottery shards and an amount of soot were laid in some sort of organic material. North of the incinerated bones, a set consisting of three pots, a cup and a bowl was laid. Grave 2 was covered with brown sandy earth and marked from the outside, as Grave 1 lay above it and north of it. Grave 2 lay on a layer of sterile soil consisting of light yellow sand. In Grave 2, Tumulus 8, a pottery set was unearthed. The shapes of the vessels belong to types of the late Urnfield culture in Posavina, while two pots are extraordinarily biconical, which, along with an incised decoration filled by an incrustation, has analogies in the central Bosnian group (Čović 1987 : Fig. 27). The shapes and incised decoration might equally have been inspired by the East, where biconical pots with incised decorations appear in the further eastern Vis-Pivnica group (Čović 1988 : 102, Fig. 28), while the incised geometrical decorations and wavy lines were a fashionable pottery decoration style in the wider area between the Lower Danube region from Banija and Kordun in the west, along the River Sava to Slovenian Podravje and Pomurje along the River Drava in the period between the 11 th and 8 th centuries BC (Hänsel 1976; Teržan 1995). At a later stage, similar ornamentation was inherited from the Basarabi style, also present on sites in northern Bosnia (Gavranović 2007) and in the west up to White Carniola in Slovenia (Dular 1979). The idea of the pottery set and tumuli, documented in Grave 2, Tumulus 6 testifies to the presence of Hallstatt ideas on the periphery of the eastern Hallstatt circle. Both excavated tumuli (T 6 and T 8) in Dolina testify to a community that communicated with its contemporaries in the neighbourhood but also from a wider area. Besides parts of attire suggesting wider connections and the local expressions in pottery, there are other elements suggesting that the members of the community living in Dolina {{at the beginning of the}} Iron Age were open to innovations (e. g. the idea of tumuli), which they applied in their everyday life (burial with two incineration graves with separate mounds in a single tumulus). This is a hypothesis that needs to be confirmed in excavations of a larger surface...|$|E
