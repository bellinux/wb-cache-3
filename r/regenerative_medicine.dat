In 2006, Rowling contributed a substantial sum toward {{the creation of a}} new Centre for <b>Regenerative</b> <b>Medicine</b> at Edinburgh University, later named the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic. In 2010 she donated a further Â£10million to the centre. For reasons unknown, Scotland, Rowling's country of adoption, has the highest rate of multiple sclerosis in the world. In 2003, Rowling took part in a campaign to establish a national standard of care for MS sufferers. In April 2009, she announced that she was withdrawing her support for Multiple Sclerosis Society Scotland, citing her inability to resolve an ongoing feud between the organisation's northern and southern branches that had sapped morale and led to several resignations.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) {{commissioned}} a 'mock technology appraisal' {{to assess whether}} changes to its methods and processes are needed. This report presents the findings of independent research commissioned to inform this appraisal and the deliberations of a panel convened by NICE to evaluate the mock appraisal. METHODS: Our research included reviews to identify issues, analysis methods and conceptual differences and the relevance of alternative decision frameworks, alongside {{the development of an}} exemplar case study of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for treating acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. RESULTS: An assessment of previous evaluations of <b>regenerative</b> <b>medicines</b> found that, although {{there were a number of}} evidential challenges, none was unique to <b>regenerative</b> <b>medicines</b> or was beyond the scope of existing methods used to conceptualise decision uncertainty. Regarding the clinical evidence for <b>regenerative</b> <b>medicines,</b> the issues were those associated with a limited evidence base but were not unique to regenerative medicines: small non-randomised studies, high variation in response and the intervention subject to continuing development. The relative treatment effects generated from single-arm trials are likely to be optimistic unless it is certain that the historical data have accurately estimated the efficacy of the control agent. Pivotal trials may use surrogate end points, which, on average, overestimate treatment effects. To reduce overall uncertainty, multivariate meta-analysis of all available data should be considered. Incorporating indirectly relevant but more reliable (more mature) data into the analysis can also be considered; such data may become available as a result of the evolving regulatory pathways being developed by the European Medicines Agency. For the exemplar case of CAR T-cell therapy, target product profiles (TPPs) were developed, which considered the 'curative' and 'bridging to stem-cell transplantation' treatment approaches separately. Within each TPP, three 'hypothetical' evidence sets (minimum, intermediate and mature) were generated to simulate the impact of alternative levels of precision and maturity in the clinical evidence. Subsequent assessments of cost-effectiveness were undertaken, employing the existing NICE reference case alongside additional analyses suggested within alternative frameworks. The additional exploratory analyses were undertaken to demonstrate how assessments of cost-effectiveness and uncertainty could be impacted by alternative managed entry agreements (MEAs), including price discounts, performance-related schemes and technology leasing. The panel deliberated on the range of TPPs, evidence sets and MEAs, commenting on the likely recommendations for each scenario. The panel discussed the challenges associated with the exemplar and <b>regenerative</b> <b>medicines</b> more broadly, focusing on the need for a robust quantification of the level of uncertainty in the cost-effective estimates and the potential value of MEAs in limiting the exposure of the NHS to high upfront costs and loss associated with a wrong decision. CONCLUSIONS: It is to be expected that there will be a significant level of uncertainty in determining the clinical effectiveness of <b>regenerative</b> <b>medicines</b> and their long-term costs and benefits, but the existing methods available to estimate the implications of this uncertainty are sufficient. The use of risk sharing and MEAs between the NHS and manufacturers of <b>regenerative</b> <b>medicines</b> should be investigated further.

30|$|While several organs in mammals retain partial {{regenerative}} capability following tissue damage, {{the underlying}} mechanisms remain unclear. Recently, the Hippo signaling pathway, better known for its function in organ size control, {{has been shown to}} play a pivotal role in regulating tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Upon tissue injury, the activity of YAP, the major effector of the Hippo pathway, is transiently induced, which in turn promotes expansion of tissue-resident progenitors and facilitates tissue regeneration. In this review, with a general focus on the Hippo pathway, we will discuss its major components, functions in stem cell biology, involvement in tissue regeneration in different organs, and potential strategies for developing Hippo pathway-targeted <b>regenerative</b> <b>medicines.</b>|$|R

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in <b>regenerative</b> <b>medicines</b> indicate that adult Mesenchymal Stromal Cells are promising candidates for cell-based therapies {{because of their}} large in vitro expansion potential. During this expansion {{one of the main}} questions is obtaining a perfect combination of antibiotics that can be used safely on cultures with minimum interference on cellular levels. Considering this basic need current investigation is designed to propose antibiotic combination with optimum concentration having minimum effect on cells characteristics. For the analysis we used four types of antibiotics with three different concentrations each; Amikacin, Gentamycin, Cefoperazone Sodium, Vancomycin. It is observed that Amikacin showed slight alterations in cell viability and morphology as compared to other antibiotics. Out of four antibiotics Vancomycin proved to be the best antibiotic followed by Gentamycin and Cefoperazone Sodium. Hence Vancomycin can be used along with the Gentamycin; Cefoperazone sodium being a third generation antibiotic can be used alone to avoid detrimental effect of other antibiotic on cell lines...|$|R

25|$|Cells {{produced}} with SCNT, or iPSCs could eventually {{be used in}} stem cell therapy, or to create organs {{to be used in}} transplantation, known as <b>regenerative</b> <b>medicine.</b> Stem cell therapy is the use of stem cells to treat or prevent a disease or condition. Bone marrow transplantation is a widely used form of stem cell therapy. No other forms of stem cell therapy are in clinical use at this time. Research is underway to potentially use stem cell therapy to treat heart disease, diabetes, and spinal cord injuries. <b>Regenerative</b> <b>medicine</b> is not in clinical practice, but is heavily researched for its potential uses. This type of medicine would allow for autologous transplantation, thus removing the risk of organ transplant rejection by the recipient. For instance, a person with liver disease could potentially have a new liver grown using their same genetic material and transplanted to remove the damaged liver. In current research, human pluripotent stem cells have been promised as a reliable source for generating human neurons, showing the potential for <b>regenerative</b> <b>medicine</b> in brain and neural injuries.|$|E

25|$|While most {{definitions}} of tissue engineering cover {{a broad range}} of applications, in practice the term is closely associated with applications that repair or replace portions of or whole tissues (i.e., bone, cartilage, blood vessels, bladder, skin, muscle etc.).

The term has also been applied to efforts to perform specific biochemical functions using cells within an artificially-created support system (e.g. an artificial pancreas, or a bio artificial liver). The term <b>regenerative</b> <b>medicine</b> is often used synonymously with tissue engineering, although those involved in <b>regenerative</b> <b>medicine</b> place more emphasis on the use of stem cells or progenitor cells to produce tissues.|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{effectiveness of}} new disease-modifying drugs that suppress disease activity in multiple sclerosis {{has opened up}} opportunities for <b>regenerative</b> <b>medicines</b> that enhance remyelination and potentially slow disease progression. Although several new targets for therapeutic enhancement of remyelination have emerged, few lend themselves readily to conventional drug development. Here, we used transcription profiling to identify mitogen-activated protein kinase (Mapk) signalling as an important regulator involved in the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) into oligodendrocytes. We show in tissue culture that activation of Mapk signalling by elevation of intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) using administration of either dibutyryl-cAMP or inhibitors of the cAMP-hydrolysing enzyme phosphodiesterase- 4 (Pde 4) enhances OPC differentiation. Finally, we demonstrate that systemic delivery of a Pde 4 inhibitor leads to enhanced differentiation of OPCs within focal areas of toxin-induced demyelination and a consequent acceleration of remyelination. These data reveal a novel approach to therapeutic enhancement of remyelination amenable to pharmacological intervention and hence with significant potential for translation...|$|R
40|$|Microparticles {{encapsulating}} <b>regenerative</b> <b>medicines</b> {{have been}} used in tissue engineering because of their several advantages, including non-invasive drug delivery and controllable drug release rates. However, microparticles implanted in tissue defects are readily displaced by external mechanical forces, decreasing their regenerative efficacy. We hypothesized that a drug-encapsulated colloidal gel formed through colloidal attraction between microparticles would resist displacement at an implant site, and subsequently improve therapeutic efficacy. This hypothesis was examined using a colloidal gel formed from the mixing of negatively charged microgels composed of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) microgels and poly(sodium acrylate), and positively charged microgels composed of PEG and poly(vinyl benzyl trimethyl ammonium chloride). The structural strength of the colloidal gel could be tuned with the zeta potential and volumetric ratios of the oppositely charged microgels. Furthermore, the implantation of the colloidal gel, encapsulating vascular endothelial growth factor, significantly increased the vascular density while limiting host inflammation, as compared with the implantation of unary microgel suspensions. This study demonstrates the enhancement in the efficacy of microparticl...|$|R

30|$|The {{nanomaterial}} {{based on}} graphene {{has been widely}} used in nonmedical fields since the last decade. Recently {{from a number of}} publications, we have evidence that graphene is attracting the attention of biomedical scientists. The wide range of applications in the delivery of gene/drug has exploited various properties of graphene such as ÏâÏ stacking and the loading of small molecular drugs on two-dimensional plane surface by hydrophobic interactions. The utilization of free Ï electrons, which disclose a negative charge on the surface, has been used to precipitate proteins and genes. GO surfaces enable possibilities for covalently linked and chemically assorted small molecules and similar proteins [105]. Although the research on graphene and its derivatives is at its early stage, in the upcoming days it will provide wide applications for biomaterial science and <b>regenerative</b> <b>medicines</b> [95, 159, 160].

40|$|Multivalency {{is the key}} {{principle}} dictating receptor-ligand {{interactions in}} biological systems. To understand these interactions in detail a model system taken out of biological complexity is required. Most of the model systems reported {{so far have been}} focused on employing strong intrinsic interactions between ligands and receptors. But strong intrinsic interactions in a multivalent system cause large changes in affinity with valency (i. e., cause a high multivalent enhancement factor) and cause the interaction pairs to be in the bound state for most of the time. These properties can lead to a kinetically trapped state of the multivalent complex, which is in contrast to biological systems in which lower multivalency enhancement factors avoid such a kinetically trapped state. To resolve this issue a weakly multivalent system has been developed in this thesis. The result is a model system with a small multivalency enhancement factor, thus ensuring higher valences not result in a kinetically trapped state of the complex. We envision that the weakly multivalent model system described in this thesis will help to understand the mechanism of multivalent interactions, for example, the interaction of the influenca virus with a cell, in a biological context. This improved understanding will help to design the next generation of molecular and <b>regenerative</b> <b>medicines...</b>|$|R
