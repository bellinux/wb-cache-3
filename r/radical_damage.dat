30|$|Antioxidants are {{molecules}} which retard the oxidation process. The oxidation reactions {{may produce}} free <b>radicals</b> which <b>damage</b> the cells by starting various chain reactions. Free <b>radicals</b> which <b>damage</b> the cells cause cancer {{and many other}} diseases. Antioxidants terminate the free radicals and stop the chain reactions. Examples of antioxidants include beta-carotene, lycopene, vitamins C, E, and A and other substances. Oxidative reaction is one of most important destructive reaction. Free <b>radical’s</b> <b>damage</b> is responsible {{for a lot of}} disorders in human like nervous disorders, inflammation, debates and viral infections. When drugs are metabolized in body the free radicals are produced. Sometimes the environmental changes and hormones become the reason of free radical production. These free radicals are responsible for all the oxidation reactions [57].|$|R

[...] It accumulates {{in the body}} because of liver damage, reacts with UV light on the skin, and leads to free radical formation.

500|$|Although {{oxidative}} phosphorylation {{is a vital}} part of metabolism, it produces reactive oxygen species such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, which lead to propagation of free <b>radicals,</b> <b>damaging</b> cells and contributing to disease and, possibly, aging (senescence).

25|$|<b>Radical</b> <b>damage</b> to DNA {{can also}} occur through the {{interaction}} of DNA with certain natural products known as radiomimetic compounds, molecular compounds which affect DNA in similar ways to radiation exposure. Radiomimetic compounds induce double-strand breaks in DNA via highly specific, concerted free-radical attacks on the deoxyribose moieties in both strands of DNA.|$|E
25|$|SOD {{may reduce}} free <b>radical</b> <b>damage</b> to skin—for example, to reduce {{fibrosis}} following radiation for breast cancer. Studies {{of this kind}} must be regarded as tentative, however, as there were not adequate controls in the study including a lack of randomization, double-blinding, or placebo. Superoxide dismutase is known to reverse fibrosis, possibly through de-differentiation of myofibroblasts back to fibroblasts.|$|E
25|$|Free <b>radical</b> <b>damage</b> to DNA {{can occur}} {{as a result of}} {{exposure}} to ionizing radiation or to radiomimetic compounds. Damage to DNA as a result of free radical attack is called indirect DNA damage because the radicals formed can diffuse throughout the body and affect other organs. Malignant melanoma can be caused by indirect DNA damage because it is found in parts of the body not exposed to sunlight. DNA is vulnerable to radical attack because of the very labile hydrogens that can be abstracted and the prevalence of double bonds in the DNA bases that radicals can easily add to.|$|E

500|$|How {{epilepsy}} develops {{after an}} insult to the brain is not fully understood, and gaining such understanding may help researchers find ways to prevent it, or make it less severe or easier to treat. [...] Researchers hope to identify biomarkers, biological indications that epileptogenesis is occurring, as a means to find drugs that can target pathways by which epilepsy develops. [...] For example, drugs could be developed to interfere with secondary brain injury (injury that does not occur at the moment of trauma but results from processes initiated by it), by blocking pathways such as free <b>radical</b> <b>damage</b> to brain tissue. [...] An increase in understanding of age differences in epilepsy development after trauma may also help researchers find biomarkers of epileptogenesis. [...] There is also interest in finding more antiepileptic drugs, with the potential to interfere with epileptogenesis. Some new antiepileptic drugs such as topiramate, gabapentin, and lamotrigine have already been developed and have shown promise in treatment of PTE. [...] No animal model has all the characteristics of epileptogenesis in humans, so research efforts aim to identify one. [...] Such a model may help researchers find new treatments and identify the processes involved in epileptogenesis.|$|E

50|$|The {{free radical}} theory of aging (FRTA) states that organisms age because cells {{accumulate}} free <b>radical</b> <b>damage</b> over time.

Several studies have tested the efficacy of melatonin to counteract oxidative damage in diseases of newborns such as chronic lung disease, perinatal brain injury, necrotizing enterocolitis, and retinopathy of prematurity, giving promising results. The peculiar perinatal susceptibility to oxidative stress indicates that prophylactic use of antioxidants as melatonin could help to prevent or at least reduce oxidative stress related diseases in newborns.
