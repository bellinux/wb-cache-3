25|$|FTICR-MS differs {{significantly}} from other mass spectrometry techniques {{in that the}} ions are not detected by hitting a detector such as an electron multiplier but only by passing near detection plates. Additionally the masses are not resolved in space or time as with other techniques but only by the ion cyclotron resonance (<b>rotational)</b> <b>frequency</b> that each ion produces as it rotates in a magnetic field. Thus, the different ions are not detected in different places as with sector instruments or at different times as with time-of-flight instruments, but all ions are detected simultaneously during the detection interval. This provides {{an increase in the}} observed signal-to-noise ratio owing to the principles of Fellgett's advantage. In FTICR-MS, resolution can be improved either by increasing the strength of the magnet (in teslas) or by increasing the detection duration.|$|E

Although the details of the glitch process are unknown, it is thought that the resulting increase in the pulsar's <b>rotational</b> <b>frequency</b> is caused by a brief coupling of the pulsar's faster-spinning superfluid core to the crust, which are usually decoupled. This brief coupling transfers angular momentum from core to the surface, which causes an increase in the measured periodicity.

50|$|The idea to use pulsars as {{gravitational}} wave detectors was originally proposed by Sazhin and Detweiler {{in the late}} 1970s. The idea is to treat the solar system barycenter and a distant pulsar as opposite ends of an imaginary arm in space. The pulsar acts as the reference clock {{at one end of}} the arm sending out regular signals which are monitored by an observer on the Earth. The effect of a passing {{gravitational wave}} would be to perturb the local space-time metric and cause a change in the observed <b>rotational</b> <b>frequency</b> of the pulsar.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the electrodynamic surface properties of bare strange quark stars. The surfaces of such objects {{are characterized by}} the formation of ultra-high electric surface fields which might {{be as high as}} ∼ 10 ^ 19 V/cm. These fields result from the formation of electric dipole layers at the stellar surfaces. We calculate the increase in gravitational mass associated with the energy stored in the electric dipole field, which turns out to be only significant if the star possesses a sufficiently strong net electric charge distribution. In part two of the paper, we explore the intriguing possibility of what happens when the electron layer (sphere) rotates with respect to the stellar strange matter body. We find that in this event magnetic fields can be generated which, for moderate effective <b>rotational</b> <b>frequencies</b> between the electron layer and the stellar body, agree with the magnetic fields inferred for several Central Compact Objects (CCOs). These objects could thus be comfortably interpreted as strange stars whose electron atmospheres rotate at frequencies that are moderately different (∼ 10 Hz) from the <b>rotational</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the strange star itself.

40|$|We employ {{computational}} {{methods to}} investigate {{the possibility of using}} electron-donating or electron-withdrawing substituents to reduce the free-energy barriers of the thermal isomerizations that limit the <b>rotational</b> <b>frequencies</b> achievable by synthetic overcrowded alkene-based molecular motors. Choosing as reference systems one of the fastest motors known to date and two variants thereof, we consider six new motors obtained by introducing electron-donating methoxy and dimethylamino or electron-withdrawing nitro and cyano substituents in conjugation with the central olefinic bond connecting the two (stator and rotator) motor halves. Performing density functional theory calculations, we then show that electron-donating (but not electron-withdrawing) groups at the stator are able to reduce the already small barriers of the reference motors by up to 18 kJ mol(- 1). This result outlines a possible strategy for improving the <b>rotational</b> <b>frequencies</b> of motors of this kind. Furthermore, exploring the origin of the catalytic effect, it is found that electron-donating groups exert a favorable steric influence on the thermal isomerizations, which is not manifested by electron-withdrawing groups. This finding suggests a new mechanism for controlling the critical steric interactions of these motors.

50|$|Inertial Response is a {{property}} of large synchronous generators, which contain large synchronous rotating masses, and which acts {{to overcome the}} immediate imbalance between power supply and demand for electric power systems, typically the electrical grid. Due to the ever existing power imbalance between mechanical power supply and electric power demand the <b>rotational</b> <b>frequency</b> of the rotating masses in all sychronous generators in the grid either speed up (excess power supply) or slow down (excess power demand). This enables the grid operator to rebalance the system {{in order to stop}} the speed change, resulting in a relatively small variation in AC frequency ideally within the allowable frequency range of that system. i.e. A 50 Hz system may allow a ±0.5 Hz deviation in the frequency of the AC voltageThe grid frequency is the combined result of the detailed motions of all individual synchronous rotors in the grid, which are modeled by a general equation of motion called the Swing Equation.|$|E
50|$|AEG {{developed}} {{a much more}} advanced system during the war, and this {{formed the basis of}} most post-war experiments. In this case the disk was pattered with a series of opaque regions, often in a series of radial stripes forming a pizza-slice pattern. Like the Hamburg, an AC signal was generated that matched the <b>rotational</b> <b>frequency</b> of the disk. However, in this case the signal does not turn on and off with angle, but is constantly being triggered very rapidly. This creates a series of pulses that are smoothed out to produce a second AC signal at the same frequency as the test signal, but who's phase is controlled by the actual position of the target relative to the disk. By comparing the phase of the two signals, which is trivial electronically, both the vertical and horizontal correction can be determined from a single signal. A great improvement was made as part of the Sidewinder program, feeding the output to the pilot's headset where it creates as sort of growling sound known as the missile tone that indicates that the target is visible to the seeker.|$|E

50|$|Internal waves, {{also called}} {{internal}} gravity waves, go by many other names {{depending upon the}} fluid stratification, generation mechanism, amplitude, and influence of external forces. If propagating horizontally along an interface where the density rapidly decreases with height, they are specifically called interfacial (internal) waves. If the interfacial waves are large amplitude they are called internal solitary waves or internal solitons. If moving vertically through the atmosphere where substantial changes in air density influences their dynamics, they are called anelastic (internal) waves. If generated by flow over topography, they are called Lee waves or mountain waves. If the mountain waves break aloft, they can result in strong warm winds at the ground known as Chinook winds (in North America) or Foehn winds (in Europe). If generated in the ocean by tidal flow over submarine ridges or the continental shelf, they are called internal tides.

[...] His technique was to exploit resonance and the nonlinear saturation {{characteristic of the}} iron rotor to use the alternator as a frequency multiplier {{as well as a}} generator.

[...] The output frequency of the Goldschmidt alternator waswhere N was a small integer, the harmonic number. N was limited to 4 in most practical machines, as losses due to leakage flux increased rapidly with increasing N. Thus a 100 kHz Goldschmidt machine with P = 300 poles would require a rotor speed of only U = 5000 RPM, one-fourth that of an equivalent Alexanderson machine. 80% efficiency could be achieved, but {{in order to keep the}} leakage flux low enough to achieve this the machine required a very narrow clearance of 0.8 mm between the stator and rotor, which could weigh 5 tons and be moving at a peripheral speed of 200 meters per second. [...] Another challenge was that to reduce hysteresis losses in the iron rotor at radio frequencies, it had to be made of very thin foil laminations, [...]05 mm (.002 in) thick, separated by paper sheets, so the rotor was more than 1/3 paper.
