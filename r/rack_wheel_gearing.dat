5000|$|In the September 1814 {{edition of}} Annals of Philosophy two {{locomotives}} with <b>rack</b> <b>wheels</b> are mentioned (probably Salamanca and Blücher), {{then there is}} mention of [...] "another steam locomotive at Newcastle, employed for a similar purpose coals, and moving along without any <b>rack</b> <b>wheel,</b> simply by its friction against the rail road". From the context this is at a different location to Blücher, so is probably Puffing Billy.|$|R

The eccentric disc is connected to the planetary wheel support (4) or an annular wheel (3) of the planetary <b>wheel</b> <b>gear</b> which has an extra drive (11, 12) for varying the speed of the press ram.
