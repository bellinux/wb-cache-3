2500|$|Thread {{grinding}} {{is done on}} {{a grinding}} machine using specially dressed grinding wheels matching {{the shape of the}} threads. The process is usually used to produce accurate threads or threads in hard materials; a common application is ball screw mechanisms. There are three types: center-type grinding with axial feed, center-type <b>infeed</b> thread <b>grinding</b> and centerless thread grinding. Center-type grinding with an axial feed is the most common of the three. It is similar to cutting a thread on a lathe with a single-point cutting tool, except the cutting tool is replaced with a grinding wheel. Usually a single ribbed wheel is used, although multiple ribbed wheels are also available. To complete the thread multiple passes are commonly required. Center-type <b>infeed</b> thread <b>grinding</b> use a grinding wheel with multiple ribs that is longer than the length of the desired thread. First, the grinding wheel is fed into the blank to the full thread depth. Then the blank is slowly rotated through approximately 1.5 turns while axially advancing through one pitch per revolution. Finally, the centerless thread grinding process is used to make head-less set screws in a similar method as centerless grinding. The blanks are hopper-fed to the grinding wheels, where the thread is fully formed. Common centerless thread grinding production rates are 60 to 70 pieces per minute for a [...] long set screw.|$|R
40|$|This is {{a report}} on {{grinding}} action of high speed steels in constant feeding load, that is, free <b>infeed</b> plunge-cut <b>grinding.</b> A grinding wheel is WA 46 G 6 V and the used high speed steels are SKH 4 (18 - 4 - 1 - 10) and HV 5. The latter {{is said to be}} improved in the resistance of tool wear behaviour by adding high vanadium and high carbon. The relations between grinding ratio, grinding force and grinding time are obtained. The wheel wear in grinding is observed by a micro-scope also. The conclusions are as follows. 1. Though a small difference in grinding force between SKH 4 and HV 5 is observed, SKH 4 differs remarkably from HV 5 in grinding ratio. The grinding ratio of SKH 4 is far better than HV 5 in both this value and in a tendency of G-t curves. 2. The poor grinding raio of HV 5 will make it difficult to apply it to multiple teeth cutter in the grinding accuracy. SKH 4 is more preferable than HV 5. 3. The wear, fracture and breakdown of a grinding wheel grains progress rapidly in case of high load. 4. The free <b>infeed</b> plunge-cut <b>grinding</b> process is seemed to be severer in view of the poor grinding ratio than the conventional grinding method of high speed steels...|$|R

40|$|Because {{of recent}} {{advances}} in precision engineering that allow controlled <b>grinding</b> <b>infeed</b> rates as small as several nanometers per grinding wheel revolution, {{it is possible to}} grind brittle materials so that the predominant material-removal mechanism is plastic-flow and not fracture. This process is known as ductile-regime grinding. When brittle materials are ground through a process of plastic deformation, surface finishes similar to those achieved in polishing or lapping are produced. Unlike polishing or lapping, however, grinding is a deterministic process, permitting finely controlled contour accuracy and complex shapes. In this paper, the development of a research apparatus capable of ductile-regime grinding is described. Furthermore, an analytical and experimental investigation of the infeed rates necessary for ductile-regime grinding of brittle materials is presented. Finally, a model is proposed, relating the <b>grinding</b> <b>infeed</b> rate necessary for ductile material-removal with the properties of the brittle workpiece material...|$|R
40|$|The {{machining}} of cemented carbides after sintering is done {{mainly by}} grinding operation. They are {{very hard and}} brittle in comparison with high speed steels. Therefore grinding cracks occur easiliy in grinding operation of sintered carbides. Grindability of sintered carbides (JIS. P 10,P 30,K 10,K 30) is examined in free <b>infeed</b> plunge-cut <b>grinding</b> with silicon carbide grinding wheel. The results obtained are as follows. 1. Metal removed is more affected by grinding cracks and pitts than hardness of sintered carbides. This {{is different from the}} grinding of high speed steels in preoious reports. 2. More wheel wear appears in the grinding of hard sintered carbides. 3. Grinding ratio of P grades is larger than K grades...|$|R

The changed <b>infeed</b> time of <b>grinding</b> process is researched as an important parameter to compare AE signals and surface roughnesses with the different infeed time in the grinding process. The experiment results show the AE signal is increased by the increased feed rate. In the infeed period of the grinding process, the surface roughness is increased at first, and then is decreased...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This article {{presents}} improved grinding roughness model established for cylindrical plunge grinding though analysing the existing roughness models. The proposed roughness model {{is to consider}} the uncertain effects of grinding, such as changes of grinding conditions and circumstance, as grinding procedure is progressed. In order to consider the uncertain effect of grinding, the time delay between programmed and actual <b>infeed</b> rate of <b>grinding</b> table is selected as weighting factor of the proposed roughness model. The developed roughness model is also used for the optimization algorithm of grinding procedure. Optimization algorithm {{in this study is}} constructed to minimize the grinding cost and to obtain the optimized dressing and grinding conditions under grinding constraints such as no-burn condition, limitation of roughness of workpiece, grinding power, etc. The optimized results also give an optimized dressing interval in batch production. The used optimization algorithm is an Evolutionary Strategy algorithm, and performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated with experiments...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{mitigate}} the problems in CNC grinding of a camshaft caused by varying grinding depth along {{the periphery of the}} cam, a novel grinding strategy is proposed to keep the grinding depth constant during the process. In comparison with the current cam grinding strategy, analysis results derived from the modelling of the process indicate that it is applicable to keep the grinding depth constant. Consequently, in combination with a constant <b>grinding</b> <b>infeed</b> speed, the material removal rate (MRR) is also kept stable. With the same grinding depth, the volume of removed material in a certain single revolution with the new processing strategy is less than the conventional process. This new strategy can increase the grinding depth without causing grinding burns. Therefore, the total number of grinding revolutions/steps decreases dramatically. Moreover, experiments for comparison of both the single revolution machining and the whole cam grinding have been carried out on a CNC 8325 B camshaft grinder. The results show that the new process improves machining efficiency dramatically while ensuring the machining quality. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|With intensifying global competition, {{manufacturers}} are facing challenges {{to reduce the}} cost of production as much as possible and yet improve their product quality. A digital machining system, which is the kernel of a virtual machining system, is desired to design optimal process conditions and evaluate processing alternatives with a minimal cost and time before the process is implemented on the shop floor. ^ The goal of this research is to develop a digital machining system based on mechanistic models. The system consists of integrative dynamic machining process models, which combine the machining process modules developed by the previous researchers in the author 2 ̆ 7 s group, a spindle analysis model, and new machining process models, such as endmilling and grinding process models developed for the integrative system. To this end, the expandable general base model is built in the system and the interfaces for extending to upper level models are provided for easy integration. ^ A comprehensive endmilling model is developed that simulates the process under general cutting conditions. A new method to extract cutting pressure coefficients is also introduced. Time-domain dynamic models are also developed to simulate cylindrical plunge grinding, surface <b>grinding</b> and <b>infeed</b> centerless <b>grinding</b> processes under general grinding conditions. The models focus on the prediction of grinding chatter. Critical issues are considered in the model, including the distributed nonlinear forces along the contact length and the geometrical interaction between the wheel and workpiece based on their surface profiles. A simulation program is developed using the models to predict regenerative forces, dynamic responses, surface profiles, stability regions, and chatter thresholds. The models are validated using numerical and experimental results. ^ The development of the digital machining system is completed by integrating the 2 ̆ 2 Dynamic Thermo-Mechanical Spindle-Bearing 2 ̆ 2 model (Li, 2002) through a modular interface using modal superposition methods. The digital machining system is evaluated in aspects of determining spindle related machining process constraints, predicting spindle status-dependent chatter boundaries and selecting cutting tools. ...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{research}} {{goal was}} to investigate localized fracture damage due to single point cutting of ceramic materials and then to compare this to multipoint cutting during precision grinding of the same materials. Two test systems were designed and constructed for the single-point cutting tests. The first system used a PZT actuator for closed-loop load control. An acoustic emission data acquisition system was used for crack initiation detection. The second test system employed a high-precision diamond-turning machine for closed-loop position (cutting depth) control. A high stiffness load cell and data acquisition system were used for crack initiation detection. Microcutting tests were carried out on silicon, borosilicate glass and CVD silicon carbide. The crack initiation thresholds and the fracture damage distribution were determined {{as a function of}} the loading conditions using a Vickers diamond as the cutting tool. The grinding tests were done using a plunge-grinding technique with metal-bonded diamond wheels. Optical microscopy, surface roughness and specific cutting energy were measured in order to characterize the fracture damage {{as a function of the}} <b>grinding</b> <b>infeed</b> rate. Simulation models were developed in order to estimate the average grain-depth of cut in grinding so that the response could be compared to the single-point microcutting tests...|$|R
