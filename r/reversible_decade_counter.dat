We also find that people who were morally contaminated by hate groups (i. e., by being led to believe that they share compatible ideological beliefs with hate groups) perceived more racism in their environments than people who are not morally contaminated by hate groups.

40|$|A novel {{approach}} to hardware fault tolerance is demonstrated that takes {{inspiration from the}} human immune system {{as a method of}} fault detection. The human immune system is a remarkable system of interacting cells and organs that protect the body from invasion and maintains reliable operation even in the presence of invading bacteria or viruses. This paper seeks to address the field of electronic hardware fault tolerance from an immunological perspective with the aim of showing how novel methods based upon the operation of the immune system can both complement and create new approaches to the development of fault detection mechanisms for reliable hardware systems. In particular, it is shown that by use of partial matching, as prevalent in biological systems, high fault coverage can be achieved with the added advantage of reducing memory requirements. The development of a generic finite-state-machine immunization procedure is discussed that allows any system that can be represented in such a manner to be "immunized" against the occurrence of faulty operation.

This paper presents a new overview over all recoveries and detailed analyses of Stonechats ringed during the breeding season in Britain, Benelux countries, and Germany. Stonechats showed stronger migratory tendencies than previously thought. Birds of known origin {{from all parts of}} Europe were recorded in north African winter quarters. Local overwintering was only observed in Britain, France, Spain, and Italy. Benelux Stonechats were fully migratory, just as their German conspecifics. British Stonechats were partially migrant; according to conservative estimates almost half (42. 1 %) of the British Stonechats migrated. Instead of segregating into residents and migrants they travelled over a continuous range of distances. Some reached north African winter ranges but median routes were shorter than those of Benelux and German Stonechats. Surprisingly, natal dispersal and post-fledging movements were longer in British partial migrants than in continental obligate migrants. These movements tended to be biased in migration directions. Sexes and age classes showed identical migratory behaviour, an unusual observation among individually migrating birds. Furthermore, migration of Stonechats did not change consistently over the last <b>decades,</b> <b>counter</b> to predictions.

It is design to be a low cost ultrasonic insect repeller. Human beings can’t hear these high-frequency sounds. Unfortunately, all insects do not react at the same ultrasonic frequency. While some insects get repelled at 35 kHz, some others get repelled at 38 to 40 kHz. Thus to increase the effectiveness, frequency of ultrasonic oscillator has to be continuously varied between certain limits. By using this circuit design, frequency of emission of ultrasonic sound is continuously varied step-by-step automatically. For each clock pulse output from op-amp IC 1 CA 3130 (which is wired here as a low-frequency square wave oscillator), the logic 1 output of IC 2 CD 4017 (which is a well-known <b>decade</b> <b>counter)</b> shifts from Q 0 to Q 4.

5000|$|PWM is most {{commonly}} used in radio control equipment today, where transmitter controls change the width (duration) of the pulse for that channel between 920 µs and 2120 µs, 1520 µs being the center (neutral) position. The pulse is repeated in a frame of between 10 and 30 milliseconds in length. Off-the-shelf servos respond directly to servo control pulse trains of this type using integrated decoder circuits, and in response they actuate a rotating arm or lever {{on the top of}} the servo. An electric motor and reduction gearbox is used to drive the output arm and a variable component such as a resistor [...] "potentiometer" [...] or tuning capacitor. The variable capacitor or resistor produces an error signal voltage proportional to the output position which is then compared with the position commanded by the input pulse and the motor is driven until a match is obtained. The pulse trains representing the whole set of channels is easily decoded into separate channels at the receiver using very simple circuits such as a Johnson counter. The relative simplicity of this system allows receivers to be small and light, and has been widely used since the early 1970s.Usually a single-chip 4017 <b>decade</b> <b>counter</b> is used inside the receiver to decode the transmitted multiplexed PPM signal to the individual [...] "RC PWM" [...] signals sent to each RC servo.Often a Signetics NE544 IC or a functionally equivalent chip is used inside the housing of low-cost RC servos as the motor controller—it decodes that servo control pulse train to a position, and drives the motor to that position.|$|R

Over the last <b>decade,</b> <b>reversible</b> electroporation has been intensively pursued as a very promising technique for the treatment of cancer.

This study suggests that irreversible electroporation may become an important and innovative tool in the armamentarium of surgeons treating cancer.
