500|$|A {{major problem}} for the team from the start was that wreck sites in the UK lacked any legal {{protection}} from plunderers and treasure hunters. Sunken ships, once being moving objects, were legally treated as chattel and were awarded to those who could first raise them. The Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 also stipulated that any objects <b>raised</b> from <b>a</b> <b>wreck</b> should be auctioned off to finance the salvage operations, {{and there was nothing}} preventing anyone from [...] "stealing" [...] the <b>wreck</b> and making <b>a</b> profit. The problem was handled by forming an organisation, the Mary Rose Committee, aiming [...] "to find, excavate, raise and preserve for all time such remains of the ship Mary Rose as may be of historical or archaeological interest".|$|R
