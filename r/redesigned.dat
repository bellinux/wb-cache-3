Analysis of the <b>redesign</b> process indicates the &quot;first generation &quot; computer-based tools are inadequate for <b>redesign</b> today.

The field results reveal insights into the use, utility and potential of this agent technology, and the paper closes with a number of promising future directions for related research. 1. <b>Redesigning</b> process <b>redesign</b> With nearly all major corporations—and many other enterprises in the military, government, universities and elsewhere—actively engaged in business process reengineering (BPR; see [2]), the reengineering phenomenon continues to be very important in business and management. However, reengineering practice to date reflects a questionable record of success, and as currently practiced, process <b>redesign</b> is an expensive, {{time consuming}} and labor-intensive activity. This makes the process of process <b>redesign</b> an attractive target for process <b>redesign.</b> Analysis of the <b>redesign</b> process (i. e., meta-redesign) indicates the &quot;first generation &quot; computerbased tools are inadequate for <b>redesign</b> today [6]. Although a plethora of tools exist for the modeling and simulation of enterprise processes [5], such tools fail to support the deep reengineering knowledge and specialized expertise required for effective <b>redesign.</b> Rather, the key, intellectual <b>redesign</b> activities must be performed manually at present, or provided through expensive BPR consulting services.

40|$|Product <b>redesigns</b> happen across {{virtually}} {{all types of}} products. While there is substantial evidence that new varieties of goods increase welfare, {{there is little evidence}} on the effect of product <b>redesigns.</b> We develop a model of <b>redesign</b> and exit decisions in a dynamic oligopoly model (a la Bajari et al. (2007)) and use it to analyse <b>redesign</b> activity in the U. S. automobile market. We find that automobile model designs become obsolete quickly in this market, leading to fairly frequent <b>redesigns</b> of models despite an estimated average <b>redesign</b> cost over $ 1 billion. Our model and estimates show that firm <b>redesign</b> decisions depend crucially on competition for market share through introductions of new <b>redesigns,</b> as well as internal incentives for planned obsolescence of the existing model design. Based on our structural model estimates and the simulated counterfactuals, we find that <b>redesigns</b> lead to large increases in welfare, as well as substantial profit for firms, due to the strong preferences consumers display for new model designs. We also show that welfare would be improved if <b>redesign</b> competition were reduced, allowing <b>redesign</b> activity to be more responsive to the planned obsolescence channel. The net effect of these changes would reduce total <b>redesigns</b> by roughly 10 %, increasing total welfare by roughly 3 %. While our model and welfare simulations are focused on the new automobile market, we provide some evidence that the gains from <b>redesigns</b> in the new automobile market are an order of magnitude larger than the losses in the secondhand automobile market...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Business Process <b>Redesign</b> is a {{process-oriented}} methodology {{to improve}} organizations through a continuous evaluation and <b>redesign</b> {{of their business}} processes. We propose {{the use of an}} evolutionary approach towards process <b>redesign,</b> which is based on <b>redesign</b> best practices. The approach is evolutionary, because local updates are made to an existing process. In this paper, we focus on one part of the approach: the creation of <b>redesign</b> alternatives. The first step in the creation of an alternative process is the selection of a process part for <b>redesign.</b> This is followed by a process transformation that determines an alternative for this selected part. Finally, the original process part is replaced by the transformed part, resulting in the alternative process. Using Petri net analysis tech-niques, the correctness of such a <b>redesign</b> creation is ensured. ...|$|R

By examining the problem-solving behavior of a number of existing <b>redesign</b> systems and approaches, we came up with a collection of problem-solving methods for <b>redesign</b> and developed a task-method structure for <b>redesign.</b> In constructing a system for <b>redesign</b> a large number of knowledge-related choices and decisions are made.
