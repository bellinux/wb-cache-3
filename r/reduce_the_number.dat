5|$|A second {{improvement}} project involves {{building a}} pedestrian tunnel to interconnect the Gallery Place station with Metro Center. A July 2005 study proposed connecting the eastern mezzanine of Metro Center {{with the western}} mezzanine of Gallery Place that are only one block apart. The proposed connection would <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of passengers that use the Red Line to transfer between the Yellow Line and the Blue and Orange lines at Metro Center. As of 2011, the project remains unfunded.|$|E
5|$|After {{hearing that}} ZAFT plans {{to attack the}} base his friends are staying at, Kira decides to {{continue}} battling to bring the war to an end. Lacus then gives Kira ZAFT's new mobile suit, , which he uses to accompany the Archangel, whose objective has also changed to ending the war. When piloting Freedom Kira is noted to avoid hitting enemy mobile suits' cockpits to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of human casualties. Kira joins the Archangel and Lacus' faction to fight both the Earth Alliance and ZAFT to stop both sides from destroying each other.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} {{section is}} being constructed {{at the city}} end that will <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of congested intersections buses must traverse to enter the Adelaide city centre; {{this is due to}} open in late 2017. The development of the O-Bahn busway {{led to the development of}} the Torrens Linear Park from a run-down urban drain into an attractive public open space. It has also triggered urban development around the north-eastern terminus at Modbury.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{emergence}} of MDR-TB, surgery has been re-introduced for certain cases of TB infections. It involves removal of infected chest cavities ("bullae") in the lungs to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of bacteria and to increase exposure of the remaining bacteria to antibiotics in the bloodstream. Hopes of completely eliminating TB were ended with the rise of drug-resistant strains in the 1980s. The subsequent resurgence of tuberculosis resulted in the declaration of a global health emergency by the World Health Organization in 1993.|$|E

5|$|Fishing gear is {{the biggest}} threat to loggerheads in the open ocean. They often become {{entangled}} in longlines or gillnets. According to the 2009 status review of loggerheads by the Fisheries Service, drowning from entanglement in longline and gillnet fishing gear is the turtles’ primary threat in the North Pacific. They also become stuck in traps, pots, trawls, and dredges. Caught in this unattended equipment, loggerheads risk serious injury or drowning. Turtle excluder devices for nets and other traps <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> being accidentally caught.|$|E

5|$|In April 1998, Wooller {{claimed that}} the council of the ICAEW was obstructing his {{campaign}} to increase democracy after it refused to allow the original text of motions that were to be published to be heard at the annual general meeting in June 1998. Wooller's first motion was about electing {{the president of the}} ICAEW democratically by ballot. The other two motions came about from the Gerrard report. The second motion said the district societies should be self-financing and the third motion was on reducing the number of council members to fifty-three. The first motion used a quotation from an Accountancy Age interview with council member Ian Hay Davison, and Wooller was told to stop circulating Hay Davison's quotation after he objected to being quoted. The ICAEW asked members to vote on {{an increase in the number}} of council members from seventy-five after requests made in the Gerrard report. Wooller asked members to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of council members to fifty-three, which was recommended by the Gerrard report as the ideal council quota. A 54% majority of the ICAEW members supported Wooller's motion to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E

On 3 November 1918, the Austro-Hungarian government signed the Armistice of Villa Giusti with Italy, ending their participation in the conflict. After the end of the war, Kaiser Karl VI was ceded as a war prize to Great Britain, {{under the terms of the}} Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye.
