40|$|This thesis {{conducts a}} robust and {{granular}} {{examination of the}} concept of ‘object’ under Article 101 (1) TFEU and its resulting legal and practical implications. To that end, a methodology focusing on the case law of the European Courts and other primary sources is adopted. This enables a legal analysis of the meaning, application and role <b>of</b> <b>restrictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition</b> by object to be undertaken. The case law reveals three key approaches adopted by the European Courts to restrictions by object: the ‘orthodox approach’, the ‘more analytical approach’ and an amalgamation of these two approaches, the ‘hybrid approach’. This finding immediately questions the dominance of the orthodox approach within legal discourse over the years. The orthodox approach contends that a limited category of agreements are considered by law to automatically restrict <b>competition</b> by virtue <b>of</b> their object. This is reflected in the European Commission’s Article 81 (3) Guidelines and is encapsulated by the widely recognised ‘object box’. This thesis poses a direct challenge to such narrow interpretation of the law. It argues that this depiction of the law does not fully reflect the jurisprudence of the European Courts. Rather the case law reveals an alternative interpretation {{of the concept of}} object based on the seminal case of Société Technique Minière concerned more with determining the aim of the agreement within its legal and economic context as opposed to its categorisation. Moreover, the ‘more analytical approach’ benefits from greater judicial support. Having established the three key approaches and their application under Article 101 (1) TFEU, the question of what is the best interpretation of the law on <b>restrictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition</b> by ‘object’ is reflected on. Based on the case law of the European Courts, it is argued the more analytical approach provides the best interpretation of the law. This is assessed in relation to the framework of Article 101 TFEU as a whole. Finally, this thesis briefly explores whether such conclusion is then consistent with the optimum function of the object criterion from an enforcement perspective...|$|R

5000|$|Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson {{emphasize}} the importance of the distribution of political power in shaping the differing paths of financial sector development in the United States and Mexico in the 19th and early 20th century. They note that in the United States banking and financial services grew rapidly because American politicians did not have the power to create monopolies in the banking sector that they could appropriate rents from. The federal nature of the US political system meant that states ended up competing with each other to attract inward investment. This in turn, made the <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition</b> in the banking sector untenable. In Mexico, on the other hand, power was centralized in the hands of Porfirio Díaz, the dictator who came to power in 1910. Suffrage was highly restricted and there were no competing federal states which meant that political power was not widely spread. As a result, [...] "the central government granted monopoly rights to banks" [...] which enabled them to [...] "raise revenue and redistribute rents to political supporters." [...] Only businesses with close personal connections to the banks and the politicians were able to gain access to finance which hindered the development of arms length finance.|$|E

50|$|The Sherman Act of 1890 {{attempted}} to outlaw the <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition</b> by large companies, who co-operated with rivals to fix outputs, prices and market shares, initially through pools and later through trusts. Trusts {{first appeared in}} the US railroads, where the capital requirement of railroad construction precluded competitive services in then scarcely settled territories. This trust allowed railroads to discriminate on rates imposed and services provided to consumers and businesses and to destroy potential competitors. Different trusts could be dominant in different industries. The Standard Oil Company trust in the 1880s controlled a number of markets, including the market in fuel oil, lead and whiskey. Vast numbers of citizens became sufficiently aware and publicly concerned about how the trusts negatively impacted them that the Act became a priority for both major parties. A primary concern of this act is that competitive markets themselves should provide the primary regulation of prices, outputs, interests and profits. Instead, the Act outlawed anticompetitive practices, codifying the common law restraint of trade doctrine. Prof Rudolph Peritz has argued that competition law in the United States has evolved around two sometimes conflicting concepts of competition: first that of individual liberty, free of government intervention, and second a fair competitive environment free of excessive economic power. Since the enactment of the Sherman Act enforcement of competition law has been based on various economic theories adopted by Government.|$|E

We consider three reasons why restricting entry could be beneficial to the government: by decreasing bid processing and solicitation costs, by increasing the chance of selecting a favored contractor and consequently reaping benefits from the favored contractor, and by decreasing the expected amount of price to the winning contractor. When the participation is costly and bidders are heterogeneous, the expected amount of price to the winning contractor may decrease by excluding ex-ante less efficient contractors.

5000|$|In Case E-8/00 Landsorganisasjonen (commonly {{referred}} to as ‘LO’) the EFTA Court had to provide an Advisory Opinion. The issue before the national court was whether a number of Norwegian municipalities had breached certain provisions of the Basic Collective Agreement for Municipalities when they transferred their occupational pension insurance scheme from one supplier, KLP, a private mutual life insurance company wholly owned {{by members of the}} Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities, to other insurance companies. The municipalities submitted that several provisions in the Basic Collective Agreement were void because they infringed Articles 53 and 54 EEA, the provisions mirroring Articles 81 and 82 EC. The contested provisions stated, inter alia, that {{in the event of a}} change of the pension company, this should be discussed with union representatives; that before the decision-making body might begin to deal with a possible change of company relevant offers for a new occupational pension scheme should be put before those members of the pension committee who represent the parties to the collective agreement; that the occupational pension scheme had to be based on a financing system that is gender-neutral and does not have the effect of excluding older employees; that before the matter might be decided upon by the municipality there had to be approval from the Norwegian Public Service Pension Fund; and that the pension scheme had to be taken note of by the Banking, Insurance and Securities Commission. The EFTA Court found that the relationship between the national law of collective bargaining and the EEA competition rules must be assessed by applying the test established by the ECJ in Case C-67/96 Albany and in related cases. It concluded that on that basis, the contested provisions would prima facie fall outside the scope of Article 53 EEA. If, however, the national court found that the contested provisions do not pursue their purported objectives, the provisions, in light of the objectives actually pursued, fall within the scope of Article 53 EEA. If so, and if the national court found that these provisions in effect required the municipalities to obtain supplementary pension insurance services from specific insurers, thus excluding, or severely limiting, their possibility of selecting other qualified service providers, these provisions were also held capable of constituting a <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition</b> within the meaning of Article 53 EEA. The Court held that, in any case, the good faith of the parties in concluding and implementing a collective agreement must also be taken into account. When examining the several elements of a collective agreement, the national court must consider their aggregate effect. Whether an agreement restricts competition, and thereby infringes Article 53 EEA, is a legal question that must be examined in light of economic considerations. The EFTA Court found furthermore that Article 54 EEA may apply if the national court were to find that the supplier of the occupational pension scheme, KLP, enjoyed a dominant position in the relevant market, that an identification might be made between the Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities and the supplier, and that their conduct in relation to the conclusion or the implementation of the contested provisions of the Basic Collective Agreement had in practice prevented transfers of supplementary pension insurance schemes from KLP to other insurance companies, in order to protect the position of KLP.|$|E

While {{more recent}} {{documents}} have placed {{more emphasis on}} maintenance of competitive markets as the first objective <b>of</b> EC <b>competition</b> policy and seemingly demoted the single market objective to second place, {{there is no doubt}} that both are important. Because the Community welcomed ten new members in 2004 and expects two to three more in 2007, the single market objective may well take on renewed importance. Many of the new Member States and candidates for EU membership are former Communist states to whom "free market" has been a pejorative term for most of the decades since the close of World War II.

40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} from an {{economic}} perspective two alternative views <b>of</b> <b>restrictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition</b> by sports associations.

In contrast, the vertical approach views the sports association as being a dominant upstream firm enjoying a monopoly position on the market stage for competition organizing services, an important input for the actual product - the sports game. Taking the recent financial fair play (FFP) initiative by UEFA (the Union of European Football Associations) as an example, we demonstrate that the different views lead to different assessments of restrictive effects and, thus, matter for competition policy decisions. The economic story of the potential restrictive effect of FFP on players' and player agents' income may fit more plausibly to the horizontal approach, whereas the potentially anticompetitive foreclosure and deterrence effects of FFP may be economically more soundly reasoned by taking the vertical view...|$|R

It analyzes the essential facility doctrine {{raised in the}} Glaxo Smith Kline case which was settled by the South African Competition Commission {{against the backdrop of}} the EU line of case law. This contribution “reopens” the settled case and provides some insights on the legal challenges (and economic implications) that the case would have raised if it had followed the Magill approach with the new product rule for which there is a consumer demand. The EU line of case law seems to emphasize more the need to promote innovation as evidenced by the “innovation surplus” requirement. However, for countries that are importers of technology where local innovation is limited or nonexistent, the “innovation surplus requirement” would be difficult to meet. Access to existing technology or to patented products would therefore be limited. From a consumer-interest perspective of a developing or technology-importing country, access to technology, in some cases, is more relevant than innovation in the first place. In addition to the discussion pertaining to “innovation” and “access”, the paper takes a transversal approach and shed light on the treatment of IP related issues in selected Sub-Saharan African countries competition laws.

Namely, the article first describes the set of traditional advocacy tools available to the Authority in order to fight the public <b>restrictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition,</b> and notes {{that it has been}} strongly strengthened in recent years as a result of important legislative innovations. Second, it analyses and elaborates on the success rates of advocacy decisions issued over the period 2013 - 2014. In this analysis, outcomes are considered positive (or partially positive) when the public administrations or legislators, national or local, have decided to comply (fully or partly) with the advice given in the opinions. On the whole, the analysis shows levels and figures of success rates outperforming the negative responses, especially when the Authority intervenes while the decision processes - of administrative or legislative acts - is ongoing, in particular when the Authority is asked for opinions, rather than issuing guidance on its own. A consultative role in competition matters can be clearly drawn for the Authority, which can provide interesting cues for competition advocacy policies in the future. Third, the article pays special attention to the new competences introduced by the legislature in 2011 and 2012, with regard respectively to Article 21 -bis of the Law No. 287 / 90 which assigned to the Authority the power to take legal action against general administrative provisions, regulations or measures of any public administration which unreasonably restrict competition; and to art. 4 of the Decree-Law n. 1 / 2012 under which the Authority can issue opinions to the Presidency of the Council of Ministers with respect to regional laws that unduly restrict competition, aimed at challenging them before the Constitutional Court.
