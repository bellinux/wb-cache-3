40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the inefficiencies {{associated with the}} regionalisation <b>of</b> milk <b>quota</b> trade. An optimisation model is developed to estimate the economic value <b>of</b> <b>quota.</b> Quota values are aggregated to derive supply and demand curves under two scenarios; first where quotas can trade nationally and second where the trade <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> is regionally restricted. Quota trade is simulated and the consequent effects on supplier structure are estimated. Through the derivation of sectoral cumulative cost curves {{it is possible to}} estimate the impact <b>of</b> regionalising <b>quota</b> trade on sector efficiency. The model is solved using National Farm Survey data from Ireland and the inefficiencies <b>of</b> regionalised <b>quota</b> trade in Ireland is estimated at€ 20 million. The model is also used to quantify the effect of policy uncertainty on quota trade. The implications of an early abolition or expansion of the EU milk quota on quota trade is quantified.
