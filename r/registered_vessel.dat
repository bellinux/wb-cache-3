50|$|Since {{the vessel}} was {{operating}} between two international ports, CATS decided to register Spirit of Ontario I under {{the flag of}} Bahamas, a flag of convenience nation, to avoid Canadian or U.S. taxes.

5000|$|The Board of Trade enquiry {{into the}} {{accident}} opened at Poplar, London, on 20 December. It was not usual to hold such an enquiry {{in the case}} of a foreign <b>registered</b> <b>vessel</b> being wrecked outside the three-mile limit, and it may have been done to respond to the criticisms which had been raised regarding the delay in coming to the ship's aid. Charles Butt QC, who had been briefed by the German government, stated that it was surprising that [...] "a large steamer with upwards of 200 persons aboard should have lain on a dangerous sand close to the English coast for thirty hours before any assistance came to her".|$|E
50|$|The {{average age}} of a seaman aboard a British <b>registered</b> <b>vessel</b> in 1938 was about 36 years and by 1945 it was about 32 years old.During the war many ships were armed with old {{artillery}} pieces and small arms, later light 20mm canons. These weapons were variously manned by trained merchant seamen of the crew, or pensioned gunlayers of the Royal Navy or Royal Marines who signed on {{as members of the}} crew and later by members of the Royal Artillery Maritime Regiment. These vessels were known as DEMS (Defensively Equipped Merchant Ships). Gunners varied in number with the armament and could be as few as one or two or as many as 30 men.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{multiple}} scanner vendor registration method for pathological retinal 3 D spectral domain {{optical coherence tomography}} volumes based on Myronenko’s Coherent Point Drift and our automated vessel shadow segmentation. Coherent point drift {{is applied to the}} segmented retinal vessel point sets used as landmarks to generate the registration parameters required. In contrast to other registration methods, our solution incorporates a landmark detection and extraction method that specifically limits the extraction of false positives and a registration method capable of handling any such noise in the landmark point sets. Our experiments show modified Hausdorff distance is reduced by a minimum of 91 % between target and <b>registered</b> <b>vessel</b> point sets with at least 94 % of bifurcations correctly overlapping based on ground truth, a significant improvement over current methods...|$|E

50|$|Because of the {{increasing}} popularity of water sports (particularly PWC), the number of vessels in use has increased {{in the last several}} decades. According to the U.S. Coast Guard, the number of <b>registered</b> <b>vessels</b> was 8,557,857 in 1980 and 12,875,568 in 2007. This has resulted in more-crowded waterways and increased hazards. Because of the increased congestion caused by the number of vessels, a heightened need for attention and caution is required by operators. In 2007, 17.2 percent of all PWC-related accidents were caused by driver inattention.|$|R
