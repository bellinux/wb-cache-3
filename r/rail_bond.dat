The rail bondings welded by alumina-thermic and electric contact methods are examined. The program for testing rails welded by alumina-thermic method consisted of two stages.

This was first used in the early 20th century, the isolated traction current return allowing a train's position to be detected using DC track circuits, and reduced any earth leakage currents that could affect service pipes and telephone cables.|$|R
50|$|Originally, {{the line}} was {{electrified}} in the 1920s using the fourth rail +420 V / -210 V system, as used by London Underground. This was changed in the 1970s to +630 V / 0 V, which in itself required no changes to the trains, only to the substations. However, the trains (1957 stock at the time) were modified for return current to be by the running rails, as on other third rail systems, so the fourth rail and the centre shoes on the trains were removed, except that four-rail running was retained between Richmond and Gunnersbury for the Underground trains that share this section, with the centre <b>rail</b> <b>bonded</b> to the running rails. The line is now electrified using that same third rail system from Richmond to , but with overhead lines now used from Acton Central to Stratford. The line into Broad Street used third rail supply and, when the through service to North Woolwich started in 1985, trains used the third rail throughout. When the trains were replaced {{a few years later}} by dual-voltage Class 313 trains, it became possible to use the overhead line equipment which had been added to parts of the line for the benefit of freight trains; there had been some unexpected difficulties with earth currents from the third rail system which this overcame. This use was steadily extended, and trains had to make a number of changes between traction current supplies during their short journey; these were at Hackney Wick, Dalston Kingsland, Camden Road and Acton Central. With the final upgrade of the line between Camden Road and Stratford, the need to change traction current systems on this stretch was eliminated, and now the only changeover takes place at Acton Central for the short section to Richmond. The line ran on third rail throughout the 1980s until 1996 when it was closed for conversion to overhead lines. In 2010, the last of the third rail sections around Camden Road station were completely removed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Adhesively <b>bonded</b> {{insulated}} <b>rail</b> joints {{are used}} to electrically isolate sections of track into discrete blocks to detect the positions of trains, and are sometimes useful in detecting rail breaks. Recent advances in high-strength rails allow {{for the use of}} higher-weight cars. With this increased axle loading of the freight lines, <b>bonded</b> <b>rail</b> joints are encountering early breakdown through either electrical or mechanical failure. Service lives as short as 12 – 18 months have been reported on some rail lines, significantly lower than the lifetime of other railway components. The cost of replacing the joints has significantly increased the desire for a joint with improved durability. Commercially available <b>bonded</b> <b>rail</b> joints are typically double butt-strap joints consisting of two steel reinforcing joint bars, <b>bonded</b> to the <b>rails</b> with an epoxy adhesive that may contain a fibreglass or aramid cloth layer. This paper investigates a tapered bonded joint that was proposed to reduce the high stresses that can result in the more typical butt-strap joint configuration. The first type of analysis models the rails and joint bars as beams, and the adhesive and ground as distributed elastic springs. Approximate solutions are obtained {{with the use of the}} Rayleigh–Ritz method. The finite-element method is used in the second type of analysis. Deflections, bending moments, andstresses areobtained. Basedon theseanalyses, tapered insulated joints shouldpro-vide some advantages over conventional insulated rail joints, such as lower deflections, bending moments, and shear stresses in the adhesive...|$|R
2500|$|In the 1970s, {{the track}} and the rolling stock used on this line and the North London Line were changed to use a {{modified}} version of the BR standard third rail system, with the fourth <b>rail</b> (now <b>bonded</b> to the running rail used for returning traction current) left in place on the sections of line shared with LU Bakerloo line trains. North of Harrow & Wealdstone, now the limit of LU operation, the fourth rail has in most places been dropped onto the sleepers and remains bonded, thus leaving the resistance of the current return path unaltered. The fourth rail remains in the normal position from Queens Park to Kilburn High Road up platform, where a trailing crossover between those two stations is maintained in use to allow reversal of Bakerloo line trains unable to gain access to London Underground at Queens Park, due to planned work or other reasons. [...] The line is currently electrified (like all shared lines) using the standard compromise voltage of 660V.
