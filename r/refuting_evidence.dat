40|$|Two new {{approaches}} for mitigating the confirmation bias are proposed and evaluated {{in the domain}} of collaborative intelligence analysis. Trainee Naval intelligence analysts and reservists (N= 27) role-played analysts working 10 problems, taking one of two different collaborative roles across problems. Each problem’s hypothesis had an equal proportion of supporting and <b>refuting</b> <b>evidence.</b> Participants chose and prioritized a subset of available evidence that would be most important in evaluating a particular hypothesis. Bias manifested itself as selecting or prioritizing a skewed subset of supporting evidence to focus on or share. Two new low-workload debiasing methods were evaluated. First, supporting or <b>refuting</b> <b>evidence</b> was laid out graphically, instead of in text. Second, other analysts shared their interpretations of evidence, instead of analysts having to interpret the evidence on their own. Results showed a significant bias to focus on and share confirming evidence across all conditions. The highest ranked evidence was also the most supportive evidence. However, bias was reduced for problems worked with the graphical evaluation format for one collaborative role. Also, participants were less biased to accept hypotheses for problems worked in a graphical format when they had interpreted the evidence-hypothesis relationship themselves. These results have implications for the basic study of decision bias (conflating support and importance) and applied design of systems that help to reduce bias...|$|E

40|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{proposed}} evolutionary and ecological explanations for why some species have more extensive geographical ranges than others. One of the most common explanations is variation in species’ dispersal ability. However, the purported relationship between dispersal distance and range size has been subjected to few theoretical investigations, and empirical tests reach conflicting conclusions. We attempt to reconcile the equivocal results of previous studies by reviewing and synthesizing quantitative dispersal data, examining the relationship between average dispersal ability and range size for different spatial scales, regions and taxonomic groups. We use extensive data from marine taxa whose average dispersal varies by seven orders of magnitude. Our results suggest dispersal is not a general determinant of range size, but can {{play an important role in}} some circumstances. We also review the mechanistic theories proposed to explain a positive relationship between range size and dispersal and explore their underlying rationales and supporting or <b>refuting</b> <b>evidence.</b> Despite numerous studies assuming a priori that dispersal influences range size, this is the first comprehensive conceptual evaluation of these ideas. Overall, our results indicate that although dispersal can be an important process moderating species’ distributions, increased attention should be paid to other processes responsible for range size variation...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: UK {{demographic}} and legislative changes combined with increasing burdens on National Health Service manpower and budgets {{have led to}} extended roles for community optometrists providing locally-commissioned enhanced optometric services (EOS). This realist review's objectives were to develop programme theories that implicitly or explicitly explain quality outcomes for eye care provided by optometrists via EOS and to test these theories by investigating the effectiveness of services for cataract, glaucoma, and primary eye care. METHODS: The review protocol was published on PROSPERO, and RAMESES publication standards were followed. Programme theories were formulated via scoping literature searches and expert consultation. The searching process involved all relevant electronic databases and grey literature, without restrictions on study design. Data synthesis focussed on questioning the integrity of each theory by considering supportive and <b>refuting</b> <b>evidence</b> from the source literature. RESULTS: Good evidence exists for cataract, glaucoma and primary eye care EOS that: with appropriate training, accredited optometrists manage patients commensurate with usual care standards; genuine partnerships can exist between community and hospital providers for cataract and glaucoma EOS; patient satisfaction with all three types of service is high; cost-effectiveness of services is unproven for cataract and primary eye care, while glaucoma EOS cost-effectiveness depends on service type; contextual factors may influence service success. CONCLUSIONS: The EOS reviewed are clinically effective and provide patient satisfaction but limited data is available on cost-effectiveness...|$|E

In the present paper this line of research was extended. A corpus analysis and an eye-tracking experiment revealed that when taking into account lexical properties of the NP host sites (i. e., animacy and concreteness) the frequency pattern and the on-line comprehension of the relative clause attachment ambiguity do correspond.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{contribution}} of different GluN 2 subunits of the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor to the induction of bidirectional hippocampal synaptic plasticity is a controversial topic. As both supporting and <b>refuting</b> <b>evidence</b> for {{the hypothesis of}} subunit specialization in opposing directions of plasticity has accumulated since it was first proposed a few years ago, we hypothesize that differences in experimental conditions may have in part contributed {{to some of the}} inconsistent results from these studies. Here we investigate the controversial hypothesis that long-term depression (LTD) is preferentially induced by GluN 2 B-containing NMDA receptors in area CA 1 of hippocampal slices. Results We find that brain slices from 2 - 3 week old rats prepared in the sagittal orientation have GluN 2 B-independent LTD whereas slices prepared in the coronal orientation have GluN 2 B-dependent LTD. There was no difference between the orientations in the fraction of the NMDAR EPSC sensitive to a GluN 2 B-selective antagonist, leading us to believe that the intracellular signaling properties of the NMDARs were different in the two preparations. Coronal slices had greater association of LTD-related intracellular signaling protein RasGRF 1 with GluN 2 B relative to sagittal slices. Antagonism of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) in the sagittal slices returned LTD to a GluN 2 B-dependent form and increased the association of GluN 2 B with RasGRF 1. Conclusions These results suggest a novel form of NMDAR modulation by mAChRs and clarify some disagreement in the literature. </p...|$|E
30|$|It {{is often}} {{pointed out that}} several field studies have failed to confirm the adverse effects shown in {{laboratory}} studies like ours and those of others [7, 26]. These field studies are taken as proof of safety and <b>refuting</b> <b>evidence</b> of the adverse effects observed in laboratory studies. We maintain, however, that not only have Schmidt et al. [1] put their studies in the proper context, but also devoted at least three rather long paragraphs to discussing the problems of detecting these effects in the field, given the diversity of possible exposure routes in the field. This treatment of the topic is hardly 'superficial' by any standard of a scientific journal with strict page limitations. In fact, Schmidt et al. [1] clearly stated that 'exposure of ladybirds to Bt toxins in Cry 1 Ab maize fields is, therefore, rather unlikely {{as long as they}} feed solely on aphids.' They further explain that this is grounded on the findings of an earlier study where neither aphids feeding on Cry 1 Ab maize nor the phloem sap of that Bt-maize event were found to contain Cry 1 Ab toxins [27]. However, many of the published field studies (including the list provided by Ricroch et al. [7]) worked at the community level (i.e., differences in species diversity between Bt and non-Bt crops) or/and at the population level (abundance/densities of populations of species or larger taxonomic units). Many of these field studies worked with temporal sampling intervals spanning at least 1 week or more (e.g. [28 – 30]) and are confounded by a number of other factors such as use of pesticides and focus on the pesticide-intensive industrial crop cotton [31, 32]. Any coccinellid or other predator larva detected at one sampling date has long developed into a pupa or adult until the next sampling date. Hence, all of these above-listed parameters measured in field trials can at best detect intergenerational effects. Underlying this approach is the assumption that diversity indices or population densities are the proper parameters for validating ecotoxicological trials that studied intragenerational effects of individual insects. While it might seem trivial that an increase of mortality of a species should lead to the decline in abundance in the field, in nature, few processes if any work in such a linear manner. All species are part of complex food webs next to many other species and many environmental factors confounding such supposedly trivial relationships (e.g., immigration/emigration, movement behavior) [33]. For a more elaborate discussion whether single species measurements can be used to anticipate community consequences, we refer to the literature that exists on this topic, for example, Holmes and Kareiva [33]. Also, in the ecotoxicology science community of chemicals, there is an ongoing, lively discussion on these issues spanning now at least four decades and the field is constantly striving for improved protocols to gain more relevance for field situations. However, on principle, these discussions affect all ecotoxicological laboratory studies regardless of their outcome as they are all riddled by the same limitations.|$|E
40|$|Autonomous agents {{within a}} multi-agent system can {{undertake}} behaviors that, while profitable for them, are {{damaging to the}} system as a whole. One way of regulating an agent's behavior is by obliging it to act in accordance with a set of specifications set out in a contract, and sanctioning it otherwise. In this paper, We propose a framework that performs two major subtasks of contract based behavior enforcement in partially observable multi-agent environments: behavior specification and behavior violation detection. The framework consists of three main components. The first is a contract specification language used to specify desired agent behavior. The second is a dialogue game used to present and <b>refute</b> <b>evidence</b> about an agent's actual behavior. The final component of the framework is a mechanism used to combine the evidence so as to reach a decision regarding an agent's guilt or innocence. We also examine existing approaches for performing contract enforcement, and describe a concrete environment where investigations into the effects of policing can take place...|$|R

30|$|As more {{observations}} {{are made and}} more knowledge is acquired and accumulated, the geological framework of the area under study becomes better understood. Other investigation tools for O&G exploration then come into play. With the advent of 2 D seismic techniques that reach great depths, this technology became a fundamental part of the suite of exploration tools utilized by the O&G industry. Offshore exploration, in particular, often begins with extensive 2 D seismic surveys. The visualization of geologic sections in great detail can suggest the presence of structures (traps) that may hold hydrocarbons, rock layers that may act as source rock, reservoir rock and seals, as well as faults, intrusions and rock kinetics that may provide adequate migration routes. Seismic technology can thus help define exploratory leads and their relative favorability, based on information about depths, structural organization and other information (Chopra and Marfurt 2005). All these could represent key indications to reinforce or <b>refute</b> <b>evidence</b> of a functioning petroleum system, that is, one that generated, migrated and accumulated hydrocarbons.|$|R
