40|$|We {{previously}} {{showed that}} disease-linked metabolic genes are often under combinatorial regulation. Using the genome-wide ChIP-Seq binding profiles for 93 transcription factors in nine different cell lines, {{we show that}} genes under high <b>regulatory</b> <b>load</b> are significantly enriched for disease-association across cell types. We find that transcription factor load correlates with the enhancer load of the genes and thereby allows the identification of genes under high <b>regulatory</b> <b>load</b> by epigenomic mapping of active enhancers. Identification of the high enhancer load genes across 139 samples from 96 different cell and tissue types reveals a consistent enrichment for disease-associated genes in a cell type-selective manner. The underlying genes {{are not limited to}} super-enhancer genes and show several types of disease-association evidence beyond genetic variation (such as biomarkers). Interestingly, the high <b>regulatory</b> <b>load</b> genes are involved in more KEGG pathways than expected by chance, exhibit increased betweenness centrality in the interaction network of liver disease genes, and carry longer 3 ′ UTRs with more microRNA (miRNA) binding sites than genes on average, suggesting a role as hubs integrating signals within regulatory networks. In summary, epigenetic mapping of active enhancers presents a promising and unbiased approach for identification of novel disease genes in a cell type-selective manne...|$|E
40|$|Most {{diseases}} {{are characterized by}} altered epigenetic and metabolic states, pointing to the need of a global and combined understanding of mechanisms underlying epigenetic and metabolic changes as an important piece to enable disease eradication. Adipocytes impact systemic homeostasis and their differentiation encompasses a phenotypic change whose function becomes impaired with diseases such as obesity and metabolic syndrome. Following an integrative systems biology approach, we combined different omics data from the differentiation of Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) adipocytes with a human metabolic model to observe key metabolic changes upon differentiation, their regulation and relevance for disease. Pursuing the link to disease, we used public data from the genome-wide binding of TFs and location of active enhancers to test for disease association in function of the <b>regulatory</b> <b>load,</b> revealing a cell type-selective enrichment for disease of the high <b>regulatory</b> <b>load</b> genes. Diverse experimental data were collected, covering a gene expression time-course during adipogenesis, with identification of miR- 27 a, miR- 29 a and miR- 222 target genes, the genome-wide binding profiles of PPARg, C/EBPa and LXRa, and the H 3 K 4 me 3 histone modification mark for actively transcribed transcription start sites (TSSs). Metabolic genes showed a highly dynamic expression pattern during adipogenesis, most being targeted by PPARg and C/EBPa. Lipid metabolism pathways including triacylglyceride synthesis showed extensive and combinatorial regulation by TFs and miRNAs, converging on known dyslipidemia genes. For data visualization, we developed a web portal that interactively renders metabolic pathways with omics data overlaid (IDARE, [URL] Public ChIP-seq data revealed a general principle of higher disease association of genes under higher regulatory control in a cell type-selective manner. First, data from the genome-wide binding of 10 TFs in HUVEC cells showed an enrichment for vascular diseases on metabolic genes targeted by > 6 TFs. Second, data from the binding {{of a total of}} 93 TFs confirmed the enrichment for disease association of genes with the top TF load in 8 additional cell lines. Finally, active enhancer data from 139 samples spanning 96 cell types and tissues demonstrated the cell type-selective disease enrichment of the genes with the highest active enhancer load. High <b>regulatory</b> <b>load</b> genes enriched for disease association beyond genetic variation, including association types like “altered expression” and “biomarker”, among others. Additionally, high <b>regulatory</b> <b>load</b> genes appeared on average in more KEGG pathways and had higher betweenness centrality in a liver disease network than other genes, showing longer 3 ’UTRs harboring more binding sites for diverse microRNA families, suggesting also a higher post-transcriptional <b>regulatory</b> <b>load</b> and a role as signal integrators within biological networks. Our results point to the pertinence of including high <b>regulatory</b> <b>load</b> genes for unbiased prioritization of novel candidate genes for disease association...|$|E

40|$|Large notch damage usually {{consists}} of failed or completely severed stiffeners or spars, or chord with failed or completely severed attached skin or web. Large notch damage results from unknown damage sources so the damage event is immediately obvious {{to the flight}} crew. The airplane must be capable of successfully completing a flight with such damage. The determinate accidental damage event is to ensure a balanced design approach in which the damage size in linked to the structural configuration. The criterion that is generally used, called the “two bay crack criterion,” states that the damage tolerant composite structure should sustain the <b>regulatory</b> <b>loads</b> with damage in skin like sharp slit or notch which extends two adjacent bays with severed center stiffener. For this damage state, any structural design must demonstrate the residual strength load capability not less than as defined in the regulations. In order to reduce costs and product lead-time, Virtual Testing (VT) {{can be used to}} reduce the scale of physical testing necessary for structures development and certification. Virtual Testing involves an accurate simulation of physical tests using multi-scale Progressive Failure Analysis. In this paper residual strength evaluation for composite structures with large notch damage using MSC. Nastran SOL 700 advanced composite based on AlphaSTAR GENOA Software has been investigated. Accurate prediction of failure of all structural aerospace component is crucial in order to achieve the goal of weight minimization, material savings and improved performances. MSC software provides a very convenient solution to perform complex analyses of the aerospace structure as well as for nonlinear analysis including materials and large deformations and strains. Using this tool we are able to optimize configuration and complete the design in less time than have been required using traditional design methods.

40|$|Background: The {{reconstruction}} of context-specific metabolic models from easily and reliably measurable {{features such as}} transcriptomics data will be increasingly important in research and medicine. Current reconstruction methods suffer from high computational effort and arbitrary threshold setting. Moreover, understanding the underlying epigenetic regulation might allow the identification of putative intervention points within metabolic networks. Genes under high <b>regulatory</b> <b>load</b> from multiple enhancers or super-enhancers are known key genes for disease and cell identity. However, their role in regulation of metabolism and their placement within the metabolic networks has not been studied. Methods: Here we present FASTCORMICS, a fast and robust workflow {{for the creation of}} high-quality metabolic models from transcriptomics data. FASTCORMICS is devoid of arbitrary parameter settings and due to its low computational demand allows cross-validation assays. Applying FASTCORMICS, we have generated models for 63 primary human cell types from microarray data, revealing significant differences in their metabolic networks. Results: To understand the cell type-specific regulation of the alternative metabolic pathways we built multiple models during differentiation of primary human monocytes to macrophages and performed ChIP-Seq experiments for histone H 3 K 27 acetylation (H 3 K 27 ac) to map the active enhancers in macrophages. Focusing on the metabolic genes under high <b>regulatory</b> <b>load</b> from multiple enhancers or super-enhancers, we found these genes to show the most cell type-restricted and abundant expression profiles within their respective pathways. Importantly, the high <b>regulatory</b> <b>load</b> genes are associated to reactions enriched for transport reactions and other pathway entry points, suggesting that they are critical regulatory control points for cell type-specific metabolism. Conclusions: By integrating metabolic modelling and epigenomic analysis we have identified high <b>regulatory</b> <b>load</b> as a common feature of metabolic genes at pathway entry points such as transporters within the macrophage metabolic network. Analysis of these control points through further integration of metabolic and gene regulatory networks in various contexts could be beneficial in multiple fields from identification of disease intervention strategies to cellular reprogramming...|$|E

40|$|Paradigms like Internet of Things and {{the most}} recent Internet of Everything are {{shifting}} the attention towards systems able to process unbounded sequences of items in the form of data streams. In the real world, data streams may be highly variable, exhibiting burstiness in the arrival rate and non-stationarities such as trends and cyclic behaviors. Furthermore, input items may be not ordered according to timestamps. This raises the complexity of stream processing systems, which must support elastic resource management and autonomic QoS control through sophisticated strategies and run-time mechanisms. In this paper we present Elastic-PPQ, a system for processing spatial preference queries over dynamic data streams. The key aspect of the system design is the existence of two adaptation levels handling workload variations at different time-scales. To address fast time-scale variations we design a fine <b>regulatory</b> mechanism of <b>load</b> balancing supported by a control-theoretic approach. The logic of the second adaptation level, targeting slower time-scale variations, is incorporated in a Fuzzy Logic Controller that makes scale in/out decisions of the system parallelism degree.

40|$|Theoretical thesis. Bibliography:The {{deregulation}} of Australia's electricity grid {{led to the}} development and growth of derivative financial products used to offset risk. These derivatives have formed a market of their own: the secondary electricity market. To date, there has been no investigation of the regulation of the secondary electricity market. This paper presents an empirical investigation of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission's ('ASIC') regulation of the secondary electricity market. Using {{a modified version of the}} regulatory conversations model, regulatory effectiveness is examined from the perspective of the subjects of regulation. The findings reveal dissatisfaction with ASIC's regulatory approach. Viewing the results through the lens of historical institutionalism further reveals that the cause of this dissatisfaction has become ingrained in ASIC as a result of ASIC's historical development. From the perspective of the subjects of regulation in the secondary electricity market, three critical junctures in ASIC's historical development prevent ASIC from properly regulating these derivatives: 1. The formation of ASIC as a 'pro-industry' body. 2. The switch from ASC to ASIC, which promoted an anti-regulatory ideology. 3. The growth in derivatives in the 90 s, which forced ASIC to adopt ineffective, pragmatic regulation. Both the existence and justifiability of these perceptions pose challenges for ASIC. This paper suggests that ASIC's historical development has left it unable to achieve its own measures of effectiveness in regulating electricity related derivatives. It further suggests that, given ASIC's funding and <b>regulatory</b> <b>load,</b> that it would be undesirable for ASIC to attempt to address the specific needs of the secondary electricity market.

40|$|Recent {{progress}} in high-throughput data acquisition has shifted the focus from data {{generation to the}} processing and understanding of now easily collected patient-specific information. Metabolic models, which have already proven to be very powerful for the integration and analysis of such data sets, might be successfully applied in precision medicine in the near future. Context-specific reconstructions extracted from generic genome-scale models like Reconstruction X (ReconX) (Duarte et al., 2007; Thiele et al., 2013) or Human Metabolic Reconstruction (HMR) (Agren et al., 2012; Mardinoglu et al., 2014 a) thereby {{have the potential to}} become a diagnostic and treatment tool tailored to the analysis of specific groups of individuals. The use of computational algorithms as a tool for the routinely diagnosis and analysis of metabolic diseases requires a high level of predictive power, robustness and sensitivity. Although multiple context-specific reconstruction algorithms were published in the last ten years, only a fraction of them is suitable for model building based on human high-throughput data. Beside other reasons, this might be due to problems arising from the limitation to only one metabolic target function or arbitrary thresholding. The aim of this thesis was to create a family of robust and fast algorithms for the building of context-specific models {{that could be used for}} the integration of different types of omics data and which should be sensitive enough to be used in the framework of precision medicine. FASTCORE (Vlassis et al., 2014), which was developed in the frame of this thesis is among the first context-specific building algorithms that do not optimize for a biological function and that has a computational time around seconds. Furthermore, FASTCORE is devoid of heuristic parameter settings. FASTCORE requires as input a set of reactions that are known to be active in the context of interest (core reactions) and a genome-scale reconstruction. FASTCORE uses an approximation of the cardinality function to force the core set of reactions to carry a flux above a threshold. Then an L 1 -minimization is applied to penalize the activation of reactions with low confidence level while still constraining the set of core reactions to carry a flux. The rationale behind FASTCORE is to reconstruct a compact consistent (all the reactions of the model have the potential to carry non zero-flux) output model that contains all the core reactions and a small number of non-core reactions. Then, in order to cope with the non-negligible amount of noise that impede direct comparison within genes, FASTCORE was extended to the FASTCORMICS workflow (Pires Pacheco and Sauter, 2014; Pires Pacheco et al., 2015 a) for the building of models via the integration of microarray data. FASTCORMICS was applied to reveal control points regulated by genes under high <b>regulatory</b> <b>load</b> in the metabolic network of monocyte derived macrophages (Pires Pacheco et al., 2015 a) and to investigate the effect of the TRIM 32 mutation on the metabolism of brain cells of mice (Hillje et al., 2013). The use of metabolic modelling in the frame of personalized medicine, high-throughput data analysis and integration of omics data calls for a significant improvement in quality of existing algorithms and generic metabolic reconstructions used as input for the former. To this aim and to initiate a discussion in the community on how to improve the quality of context-specific reconstruction, benchmarking procedures were proposed and applied to seven recent contextspecific algorithms including FASTCORE and FASTCORMICS (Pires Pacheco et al., 2015 a). Further, the problems arising from a lack of standardization of building and annotation pipelines and the use of non-specific identifiers was discussed in the frame of a review. In this review, we also advocated for a switch from gene-centred protein rules (GPR rules) to transcript-centred protein rules (Pfau et al., 2015) ...|$|E

The <b>loading</b> method was based on reversible hypotonic hemolysis, which allows the opening of transient pores in the cell membrane to be crossed by DSP. The efficiency of encapsulation and the biochemical and physiological characteristics of the processed erythrocytes were investigated in blood samples from 34 healthy donors.
