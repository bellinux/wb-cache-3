25|$|After {{the merger}} between Square and Enix in 2003, many rookie staff members {{had to be}} trained and there were more new {{platforms}} to develop for {{with the release of}} the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable. Toriyama decided to assemble and direct a team of scenario writers and joined various game projects. He later collaborated with Final Fantasy X main programmer Koji Sugimoto and supervisor Yoshinori Kitase to create a Final Fantasy VII tech demo for the PlayStation 3. Development of this took around 6 weeks. During the first year after the development start of Final Fantasy XIII in April 2004, Toriyama thought up a story premised on the Fabula Nova Crystallis mythology created by Kazushige Nojima. In March 2006, when the structural part of the narrative started to come together and lead scenario writer Daisuke Watanabe joined the team, Toriyama showed him a <b>rough</b> <b>outline</b> of what he had written and asked him to flesh out the story and to correct how everything would connect.|$|E

500|$|After {{designing}} the show, {{the two had}} significant difficulties getting the series green lit. It was not picked up for fifteen years. In their final pitch to the Walt Disney Company, the creators designed a recorded storyboard, featuring a very <b>rough</b> <b>outline</b> of characters. The prototype Phineas was ruder to others than the version in the eventual show, where the creators decided to make him more kind. Citing comedy's [...] "big duos" [...] including Wallace and Gromit and Jay and Silent Bob, the creators chose to give Phineas most of the dialogue while Ferb remains almost silent.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} approached Armitage in November 2007, {{following the}} completion of the second series of Robin Hood, for which he played the regular part of Sir Guy of Gisbourne.

500|$|All of the season's episodes {{began as}} simple two-to-three-page {{outlines}} that contained the necessary plot information. These outlines were then handed off to storyboard artists, who would then expand the <b>rough</b> <b>outline</b> {{into a full}} storyboard. The episodes' design and coloring were done in Burbank, California. Animation was handled overseas in South Korea, either by Rough Draft Korea or by Saerom Animation. The season was storyboarded and written by Muto, Elizabeth Ito, Ward, Sean Jimenez, McHale, Luther McLaurin, Armen Mirzaian, Kent Osborne, Pete Browngardt, Niki Yang, Cole Sanchez, Tom Herpich, Bert Youn, Ako Castuera, and J. G. Quintel. Quintel, who would later go on to create the popular Cartoon Network series Regular Show, co-wrote and boarded the episode [...] "Ocean of Fear" [...] after asking Ward if he wanted any freelance help for Adventure Time.

500|$|Once Barwood and Falstein {{completed}} the <b>rough</b> <b>outline</b> of the story, Barwood wrote the actual script, {{and the team}} began to conceive the puzzles and to design the environments. The Atlantean artifacts and architecture devised by lead artist William Eaken were made to resemble those of the Minoan civilization, while the game in turn implies that the Minoans were inspired by Atlantis. Barwood intended for the Atlantean art to have an [...] "alien" [...] feel to it, with the machines seemingly operating on as yet unknown physics rather than on magic. The majority of the 256-color backgrounds in the game were mostly mouse-drawn with Deluxe Paint, though roughly ten percent were paintings scanned {{at the end of}} the development cycle. As a consequence of regular design changes, the images often had to be revised by the artists. Character animations were fully rotoscoped with video footage of Steve Purcell for Indiana's and Collette Michaud for Sophia's motions. The main art team that consisted of Eaken, James Dollar and Avril Harrison was sometimes consulted by Barwood to help out with the more graphical puzzles in the game, such as a broken robot in Atlantis.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{original}} {{score was}} primarily composed, arranged, and produced by Shoji Meguro. The soundtrack features songs with vocals by Shihoko Hirata, whom Meguro felt {{was able to}} meet the range of emotion needed for the soundtrack, with the lyrics being written by Reiko Tanaka. Meguro was given a <b>rough</b> <b>outline</b> of the game's plot and worked on the music in the same manner and simultaneously with the development of the story and spoken dialog, starting with the overall shape of the songs and eventually working on the finer details. According to Meguro, the songs [...] "Pursuing My True Self" [...] and [...] "Reach Out to the Truth" [...] were composed to reflect the inner conflicts of the game's main characters; the former song, used as the opening theme, helped to set an understanding of the characters' conflicts, while the latter, used in battle sequences, emphasized the [...] "strength of these characters to work through their internal struggles." [...] The [...] "Aria of the Soul" [...] theme used in the Velvet Room, a concept common to all the Persona games, remained relatively unchanged, with Meguro believing [...] "the shape of the song had been well-defined" [...] from previous games. Composers Atsushi Kitajoh and Ryota Koduka also contributed music for the game. Kitajoh, who had previously written music for Atlus with Growlanser VI and , contributed four themes to Persona 4, while Koduka wrote the [...] "Theme of Junes".|$|E
500|$|The season {{also saw}} {{several of the}} show's cast write their own episodes. Series co-star Gillian Anderson {{directed}} and wrote her first episode of the series, [...] "all things". Anderson originally approached Carter about writing and directing an episode of the series during the sixth season. Anderson crafted a script that would see Scully pursuing a [...] "deeply personal X-File, one which in [...] is taken down a spiritual path when logic fails her". Anderson had only a <b>rough</b> <b>outline</b> of the script until one day she wrote {{a majority of the}} story in one sitting. She explained, [...] "A certain concept began to form, [...] I just wrote the entire outline for 'all things' right then and there. It all just kind of came together on the page". The next day, Anderson pitched the script to Carter, who approved of the [...] "personal and quiet" [...] characteristics of the story. In addition, series regular Davis wrote his only episode, [...] "En Ami". Davis approached Carter with his idea about Cigarette Smoking Man trying to seduce Scully with medical knowledge, and Carter, who was intrigued, responded positively to the idea. He assigned executive producer Spotnitz to work with Davis and craft a full-fledged script. The script went through many revisions. Because Cigarette Smoking Man was able to manipulate Scully, Carter later referred to the [...] "En Ami" [...] as [...] "the creepiest episode of the year." ...|$|E

Rachel Saltz of The New York Times wrote [...] "Piku, {{directed}} by Shoojit Sircar from a script by Juhi Chaturvedi, isn't a typical Hindi movie. It lopes along, following no formula beyond the <b>roughest</b> <b>outlines</b> of a romantic comedy." ...|$|R
50|$|Espenson {{notes that}} a recent trend {{has been to}} {{eliminate}} {{the role of the}} mid-level writer, relying on the senior writers to do <b>rough</b> <b>outlines</b> and giving the other writers a bit more freedom. Regardless, when the finished scripts are sent to the top writers, the latter do a final round of rewrites. Espenson also notes that a show that airs daily, with characters who have decades of history behind their voices, necessitates a writing staff without the distinctive voice that can sometimes be present in prime-time series.|$|R
50|$|The most {{frequent}} problems heard by Jean McTaggart, the Bureau’s executive director, {{came from the}} wives upset about the effect unemployment and inactivity was having on their husbands. She recalled the typical report of “…worries, unemployed husbands under their feet, {{and the sight of}} arguing, fist-waving men on the street corners…”. The bureau, which tried to encourage self-help as an important part of its counselling, had already established knitting and sewing clubs for women. Following the <b>rough</b> <b>outlines</b> of a men’s social club established in Winnipeg, the Bureau began a service club.|$|R
500|$|In March 2006, {{when the}} {{structural}} {{part of the}} narrative started to come together, lead scenario writer Daisuke Watanabe joined the team. Toriyama gave him a <b>rough</b> <b>outline</b> of the first eight chapters, which included several cornerstone scenes {{that needed to be}} kept, like when party members were separated or reunited. He told Watanabe what he wanted to express with the scenario, and asked him to flesh out the story and to strengthen how the points in his outline connected. For example, Toriyama's rudimentary instructions in the document would say [...] "Snow and Hope reconcile". Watanabe had to decide about how the scenes with this reconciliation would play out, then write the scenario that way. To emphasize what the story tried to express, Watanabe adjusted the personalities Toriyama had given to each character. For example, he felt that the party should not have a [...] "reliable and calm leader type" [...] {{at the beginning of the}} story, in order to more accurately show the confusion and unease after the protagonists transform into l'Cie. Toriyama has said that one of the storytelling challenges was the despair of the characters and the many points at which they are seemingly cornered. He mentioned the scene where Sazh tries to commit suicide as one such example: Although Toriyama felt it was [...] "almost a little too dark", he wanted to include something like it in the game. In contrast, he said that lighthearted elements such as Sazh's Chocobo chick helped maintain a good balance.|$|E
500|$|For XIII-2, Toriyama {{wanted a}} dark and serious tone {{to the world and}} story, in {{contrast}} to the jovial atmosphere of Final Fantasy X-2, and the story was scripted to play out as [...] "pieces of drama" [...] like a television series. Its story and characters were focused around the concepts of mortality and, in Toriyama's words, the [...] "wish for rebirth": the latter theme was directly inspired by the Great East Japan earthquake. Watanabe stayed as one of the game's writers, with writer and novelist Emi Nagashima, better known under her pen name of Jun Eishima, coming on as a story consultant. Lightning's outfit for the game was designed by Isamu Kamikokuryo, who worked from a <b>rough</b> <b>outline</b> done by Nomura, who also designed the characters' facial features. Two new character designers were brought in: Hideo Minaba, who contributed to new character outfits such as Hope and Alyssa's, and Yusuke Naora, who designed outfits for Serah, Noel and Caius. Lightning and Serah's designs were created to directly reflect the environments they start out from. The character of Noel was added at a later stage in the original planning, since the original plan for Serah to travel alone with the moogle Mog seemed to clash too much with the game's serious nature. For Lightning Returns, the developers decided to have Lightning as the sole protagonist so that players could get to know her better. The story was created to bring closure for the characters of the series. The core themes of the game were the [...] "salvation of souls", and the [...] "rebirth of Lightning", the latter being the main reason the game was not called XIII-3. Norura returned to design Lightning and Snow's new looks and Kamikokuryo returned to design new outfits for Lightning and help with the world design. Two new designers brought in were Toshitaka Matsuda, an artist for , and Toshiyuki Itahana, who had worked on Final Fantasy IX and the Crystal Chronicles series. Both designed multiple battle costumes for Lightning, many of them inspired by the artwork of Yoshitaka Amano. Itahana and Matsuda also respectively designed Lumina and Bhunivelze. Watanabe returned as the main scenario writer, while also receiving ideas for scenes from Toriyama and other members of staff. His work on the script was slow, causing problems {{from the rest of the}} development team: in response to this, he worked hard to create an appropriate finale. During his work, he had a strong nostalgic feeling while writing the characters' lines.|$|E
