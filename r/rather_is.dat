5|$|All {{observation}} involves both {{perception and}} cognition. That is, {{one does not}} make an observation passively, but <b>rather</b> <b>is</b> actively engaged in distinguishing the phenomenon being observed from surrounding sensory data. Therefore, observations are affected by one's underlying understanding {{of the way in}} which the world functions, and that understanding may influence what is perceived, noticed, or deemed worthy of consideration. In this sense, it can be argued that all observation is theory-laden.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen, as atomic H, is {{the most}} {{abundant}} chemical element in the universe, making up 75% of normal matter by mass and more than 90% by number of atoms. (Most {{of the mass of}} the universe, however, is not in the form of chemical-element type matter, but <b>rather</b> <b>is</b> postulated to occur as yet-undetected forms of mass such as dark matter and dark energy.) This element is found in great abundance in stars and gas giant planets. Molecular clouds of H2 are associated with star formation. Hydrogen plays a vital role in powering stars through the proton-proton reaction and the CNO cycle nuclear fusion.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Ka, {{which is a}} measure of how much energy is needed to stretch the bilayer, Kb {{is a measure of}} how much energy is needed to bend or flex the bilayer. Formally, bending modulus is defined as the energy required to deform a membrane from its intrinsic curvature to some other curvature. Intrinsic curvature is defined by the ratio of the diameter of the head group to that of the tail group. For two-tailed PC lipids, this ratio is nearly one so the intrinsic curvature is nearly zero. If a particular lipid has too large a deviation from zero intrinsic curvature it will not form a bilayer and will instead form other phases such as micelles or inverted micelles. Addition of small hydrophilic molecules like sucrose into mixed lipid lamellar liposomes made from galactolipid-rich thylakoid membranes destabilises bilayers into micellar phase. Typically, Kb is not measured experimentally but <b>rather</b> <b>is</b> calculated from measurements of Ka and bilayer thickness, since the three parameters are related.|$|E

5|$|Survivors is a British {{science fiction}} {{television}} series {{produced by the}} BBC. It depicts {{the lives of a}} group of people who survived a virulent unknown strain of influenza which has wiped out most of the human species. According to the producers, the series is not a remake of the 1970s BBC television series Survivors (1975–1977), created by Terry Nation, but <b>rather</b> <b>is</b> loosely based on the novel of the same name that Nation wrote following the first series of the 1970s programme. Two series were produced of the new show: series 1 ran on BBC One and BBC HD in November–December 2008, and series 2 ran in January–February 2010, ending with a cliffhanger. The BBC announced on 13 April 2010 that, due to poor viewing figures and other considerations, Survivors had been cancelled.|$|E
5|$|The Imperfect {{portrays the}} verb as an {{incomplete}} action {{along with the}} process by which it came about, either as an event that has not begun, an event that has begun but is still in the process, or a habitual or cyclic action that is on an ongoing repetition. The Imperfect can also express modal or conditional verbs, as well as commands in the Jussive and Cohortative moods. While often future tense, it also has uses in the past and present under certain contexts. Biblical Hebrew tense is not necessarily reflected in the verb forms per se, but <b>rather</b> <b>is</b> determined primarily by context. The Participles also reflect ongoing or continuous actions, but are also subject to the context determining their tense.|$|E
5|$|The second {{campaign}} {{reveals that}} Kerrigan was not {{killed by the}} Zerg, but <b>rather</b> <b>is</b> captured and infested {{in an effort to}} incorporate her psionic traits into the Zerg gene pool. She emerges with far more psionic powers and physical strength, her DNA completely altered. Meanwhile, the Protoss commander Tassadar discovers that the Zerg's cerebrates cannot be killed by conventional means, but that they can be harmed by the powers wielded by the heretical dark templar. Tassadar allies himself with the dark templar prelate Zeratul, who assassinates Zasz, one of the Zerg's cerebrates in their hive clusters on Char. The cerebrate's death results in its forces running amok through the Zerg hives, but briefly links the minds of Zeratul and the Zerg Overmind, allowing the Overmind to finally learn the location of the Protoss homeworld Aiur, which the Overmind has been seeking for millennia. The main Zerg swarm promptly invades Aiur while Kerrigan is dispatched to deal with Tassadar and despite heavy Protoss resistance, the Overmind is able to embed itself into the crust of the planet.|$|E

It should be noted, however, that although Seventh-day Adventists do not {{believe that the}}y are saved by keeping Saturday as the Sabbath, they attach considerably greater significance to Saturday-Sabbath keeping than other denominations attach to worship on Sunday.|$|E
25|$|In most regions today, maize {{grown in}} {{residential}} gardens is still often planted manually with a hoe, whereas maize grown commercially {{is no longer}} planted manually but <b>rather</b> <b>is</b> planted with a planter. In North America, fields are often planted in a two-crop rotation with a nitrogen-fixing crop, often alfalfa in cooler climates and soybeans in regions with longer summers. Sometimes a third crop, winter wheat, {{is added to the}} rotation.|$|E
25|$|Similar to {{the issue}} of a point of {{reference}} is the issue of orientation: a displacement in 2 or 3 dimensions is not just a length, but is a length together with a direction. (This issue does not arise in 1 dimension, or <b>rather</b> <b>is</b> equivalent to the distinction between positive and negative.) Thus, to compare or combine two dimensional quantities in a multi-dimensional space, one also needs an orientation: they need to be compared to a frame of reference.|$|E

25|$|The terms {{draw and}} tie, which are synonymous in many sports, have {{distinct}} meanings in cricket. A tie {{refers to a}} match in which the game is completed and the two teams finish with exactly the same score. A draw refers to a two-innings match that does not reach a conclusion, usually through a lack of time and/or rain. A limited overs match which does not reach a conclusion due to rain is not considered a draw, but <b>rather</b> <b>is</b> said to have no result.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} morality, Kant {{argued that the}} source of the good lies not in {{anything}} outside the human subject, either in nature or given by God, but <b>rather</b> <b>is</b> only the good will itself. A good will is one that acts from duty in accordance with the universal moral law that the autonomous human being freely gives itself. This law obliges one to treat humanityunderstood as rational agency, and represented through oneself as well as othersas an end in itself rather than (merely) as means to other ends the individual might hold. This necessitates practical self-reflection in which we universalize our reasons.|$|E
25|$|The {{information}} on his Ethics is scanty. He tried {{to supplement the}} Platonic doctrine at various points, {{and at the same}} time to give it a more direct applicability to life. He distinguished from the good and the bad something which is neither good nor bad. Following the ideas of his Academic predecessors, he viewed the good as that which should be striven after for itself, that is, which has value in itself, while the bad is the opposite of this. Consequently, that which is neither good nor bad is what in itself is neither to be striven after nor to be avoided, but derives value or the opposite according as it serves as means for what is good or bad, or <b>rather,</b> <b>is</b> used by us for that purpose.|$|E

25|$|If the Taoiseach {{loses the}} support of a {{majority}} in Dáil Éireann, he/she is not automatically removed from office but, <b>rather,</b> <b>is</b> compelled either to resign or to persuade the President to dissolve the Dáil. The President may refuse to grant a dissolution and, in effect, force the Taoiseach to resign; to date, no president has exercised this prerogative, though the option arose in 1944 and 1994, and twice in 1982. The Taoiseach may lose {{the support of}} Dáil Éireann by the passage of a vote of no confidence, or the failure of a vote of confidence; or alternatively, the Dáil may refuse supply. In the event of the Taoiseach's resignation, he/she continues to exercise the duties and functions of his/her office until the appointment of a successor.|$|E
25|$|Sin is not {{viewed by}} the Orthodox as a stain on the soul {{that needs to be}} wiped out, or a legal {{transgression}} that must be set right by a punitive sentence, but rather as a mistake made by the individual with the opportunity for spiritual growth and development. An act of Penance (epitemia), if the spiritual guide requires it, is never formulaic, but <b>rather</b> <b>is</b> directed toward the individual and their particular problem, as a means of establishing {{a deeper understanding of the}} mistake made, and how to effect its cure. Because full participatory membership is granted to infants, it is not unusual for even small children to confess; though the scope of their culpability is far less than an older child, still their opportunity for spiritual growth remains the same.|$|E
25|$|Several {{critics and}} {{scientists}} {{have expressed concern}} that the nature of the main couple's relationship is not BDSM at all, but <b>rather</b> <b>is</b> characteristic of an abusive relationship. In 2013, social scientist Professor Amy E. Bonomi published a study wherein the books were read by multiple professionals and assessed for characteristics of intimate partner violence, or IPV, using the CDC's standards for emotional abuse and sexual violence. The study found that nearly every interaction between Ana and Christian was emotionally abusive in nature, including stalking, intimidation, and isolation. The study group also observed pervasive sexual violence within the CDC's definition, including Christian's use of alcohol to circumvent Ana's ability to consent, and that Ana exhibits classic signs of an abused woman, including constant perceived threat, stressful managing, and altered identity.|$|E
