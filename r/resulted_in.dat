5|$|Despite {{these new}} rules, {{football}} remained a violent sport.

A 1905 peak of 19 fatalities nationwide <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> a threat by President Theodore Roosevelt {{to abolish the}} game unless major changes were made. In response, sixty-two colleges and universities met in New York City to discuss rule changes on December 28, 1905, and these proceedings <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> {{the formation of the}} Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States, later named the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).|$|E

In addition, river flooding <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> the closure of one school and large swells produced by the storm <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> several lifeguard rescues at island beaches.
