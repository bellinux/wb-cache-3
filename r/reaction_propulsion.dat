Two differing revised {{versions}} - one designated as the Me 328C, to be fitted with a Jumo 004 turbojet — and another, in-house proposal that did not receive a letter suffix, used two As 014 pulsejets mounted on pylons mounted onto the rear fuselage sides — refitted with a twin tail empennage design — along with a Porsche 109-005 single-use turbojet of 500 kg thrust in the same dorsal rear location as meant for its use on the V-1, allowed with the new twin-tail design — but neither of these proposals came to anything.

Some nanomotors can even be propelled by multiple stimuli, with varying responses.

40|$|Abstract. Water jet propulsion(WJP) with {{positive}} displacement pump (PD pump), in which the suction thrust of PD pump (Due {{to the effect of}} pump suction and the influence of the suction boundary layer) and the reaction thrust of water jet are used to push watercraft forward, has many advantages like high efficiency,low noise, high maneuverability, good adaptability to variable working conditions, simple transmission mechanism over traditional propulsion methods. A mathematical model is developed and the WJP theory with PD pump is analyzed. Numerical studies are carried out to study the suction thrust, <b>reaction</b> thrust, and <b>propulsion</b> efficiency of the thruster with Bernoullihyperbolic suction inlet-PD pump-Bernoulli hyperbolic nozzle. The results show that: 1) in the conditions of no cavitation in suction inlet and constant flow rate, the suction thrust is inversely proportional to the inlet diameter and reaches around 8. 5 % of the total thrust; 2) the reaction thrust increases with the decrease of the nozzle diameter; 3) the pump-suction coefficient v is proportional to the speed ratio µ; 4) the efficiency of WJP with PD pump is higher than with negative displacement pump under the same speed ratio.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} several missions that exploit the capabilities of a Low Energy Nuclear <b>Reaction</b> (LENR) aircraft <b>propulsion</b> system. LENR {{is a form of}} nuclear energy and potentially has over 4, 000 times the energy density of chemical energy sources. It does not have any harmful emissions or radiation which makes it extremely appealing. The global reliance on crude oil for aircraft energy creates the opportunity for a revolutionary change with LENR. LENR will impact aircraft performance capabilities, military capabilities, the environment, the economy, and society. Although {{there is a lot of}} interest in LENR, there is no proven theory that explains it. Some of the technical challenges are thermal runaway and start-up time. This paper does not explore the feasibility of LENR and assumes that a system is available. A non-dimensional aircraft mass (NAM) ratio diagram is used to explore the aircraft system design space. The NAM ratio diagram shows that LENR can enable long range and high speed missions. The design space exploration led to the conclusion that LENR aircraft would be well suited for high altitude long endurance (HALE) missions, including communications relay and scientific missions for hurricane tracking and other weather phenomena, military intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and airspace denial missions, supersonic passenger transport aircraft, and international cargo transport.

40|$|The {{development}} of endothermic fuels {{is important for}} providing efficient cooling to scramjet combustors operating at high Mach numbers. Generally the fuel itself {{can be used as}} coolant for the engine elements. Since preheating the fuel is desirable before combustion, it can be circulated in heat transfer passages em-bedded inside the hot engine parts so that the excess heat of the engine is removed by the fuel and in the process the fuel is also regeneratively preheated to the desired temperature. Endo-thermic fuels pertain to a class of fuels, which make use of certain endothermic reactions to provide an additional heat sink for cooling the engine hot end parts through embedded heat ex-change devices. While traditional fuels use only the sensible heat of the fuels for cooling, endothermic fuels provide cooling through two routes, namely, the absorption of the sensible heat and through the use of endothermic <b>reactions.</b> At the <b>Propulsion</b> Division, NAL, the concept of endothermic cooling has been ex-perimentally demonstrated using kerosene as the fuel and molec-ular sieves as the cracking catalyst.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} {{was to determine the}} effects of chronic plantar fasciitis on intrinsic foot structures with respect to biomechanics, muscle atrophy and muscle energetics. This was accomplished in three parts. Methods: In Part I, a three-dimensional motion capture system with a synchronized force platform quantified multi-segment foot model kinematics and ground reaction forces associated with walking. Healthy individuals were compared to individuals with chronic plantar fasciitis feet. Typical kinematic variables, measures of coupling, phase and variability were examined in rearfoot, forefoot and hallux segments. In Part II, foot and leg magnetic resonance images were taken in subjects with unilateral plantar fasciitis so that within each subject, the healthy limb could be compared to the plantar fasciitis limb. Cross sectional areas (CSA) of the plantar intrinsic foot muscles (PIFM) and tibialis posterior muscle were computed from user-digitized images. In Part III, the metabolic demands of the PIFM were evaluated using phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy at rest and after barefoot walking. Muscle pH and the ratio of inorganic phosphate to phosphocreatine (Pi/PCr) were compared in healthy and plantar fasciitis feet. Results: In comparison to healthy feet, plantar fasciitis feet exhibited significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) : 1) greater rearfoot motion, 2) greater sagittal plane forefoot motion, 3) fewer rearfoot-forefoot frontal anti-phase movements, 4) reduced rearfoot-forefoot transverse coordinative variability, 5) greater first metatarsophalangeal (FMPJ) joint dorsiflexion, 6) greater FMPJ-medial longitudinal arch (MLA) coupling variability, and 7) decreased vertical ground <b>reaction</b> forces at <b>propulsion.</b> Also, plantar fasciitis feet had 5. 2...|$|R
40|$|This team is {{exploring}} a modified Z-pinch geometry as a propulsion system, imploding a liner of liquid lithium onto a pellet containing both fission and fusion fuel. The plasma {{resulting from the}} fission and fusion burn expands against a magnetic nozzle, for propulsion, or a magnetic confinement system, for terrestrial power generation. There is considerable synergy in the concept; the lithium acts as a temporary virtual cathode, and adds <b>reaction</b> mass for <b>propulsion.</b> Further, the lithium acts as a radiation shield against generated neutrons and gamma rays. Finally, the density profile of the column can be tailored using the lithium sheath. Recent theoretical and experimental developments (e. g. tailored density profile in the fuel injection, shear stabilization, and magnetic shear stabilization) have had great success in mitigating instabilities that have plagued previous fusion efforts. This paper will review the work in evaluating the pellet sizes and z-pinch conditions for optimal PuFF propulsion. Trades of pellet size and composition with z-pinch power levels and conditions for the tamper and lithium implosion are evaluated. Current models, both theoretical and computational, show that a z-pinch can ignite a small (~ 1 cm radius) fission-fusion target with significant yield. Comparison is made between pure fission and boosted fission targets. Performance is shown for crewed spacecraft for high speed Mars round trip missions and near interstellar robotic missions. The PuFF concept also offers a solution for terrestrial power production. PuFF can, with recycling of the effluent, achieve near 100 % burnup of fission fuel, providing a very attractive power source with minimal waste.

Selection of these launch systems and engines is driven by numerous factors including development cost, existing infrastructure, operations cost, and reliability. Incorporation of green systems for sustained operations and extensibility into future systems is an additional consideration for system design.
