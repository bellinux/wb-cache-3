The Minneapolis—St. Paul market is unique in that all three television duopolies in the market, which besides KMSP/WFTC, include Twin Cities Public Television's KTCA/KTCI and Hubbard Broadcasting's KSTP and KSTC, have merged their various signals onto the same VHF PSIP channel slots for easier viewer reference (with all but KMSP-TV transmitting on UHF). KMSP and WFTC unified all of their over-the-air channels as virtual subchannels of KMSP. As a result, the PSIPs of WFTC changed to channel 9.|$|E
50|$|A {{multi-frequency}} network (MFN) is {{a network}} in which multiple radio frequencies (<b>RFs)</b> (or <b>RF</b> <b>channels)</b> {{are used to}} transmit media content. One type of MFN is a horizontal multi-frequency network (HMFN) where a distribution waveform is transmitted over different <b>RF</b> <b>channels</b> in different local areas. The same or different content may be transmitted as part of distribution waveforms carried over different <b>RF</b> <b>channels</b> in such local areas. Another type of MFN is a vertical multi-frequency network (VMFN) in which multiple radio frequency (<b>RF)</b> <b>channels</b> are used in a given local area to transmit independent distribution waveforms with an aim to increase {{the capacity of the}} network (in terms of the ability to deliver more content to a device/end user). An MFN deployment may also consist of VMFN in certain areas and HMFN in certain other areas.|$|R

40|$|We propose and {{investigate}} Multi-Channel Extremely Opportunistic Routing (MCExOR) {{which is a}} protocol that extends Extremely Opportunistic Routing by utilizing multiple <b>RF</b> <b>channels</b> in multi-hop wireless networks. Large numbers of transmissions per end-to-end delivery combined with interference are {{the main reasons for}} the low capacity of wireless multi-hop networks. MCExOR reduces the overall number of transmissions in wireless multi-hop networks by opportunistically skipping nodes in a packet’s forwarding path. The use of multiple non overlapping <b>RF</b> <b>channels</b> contributes to the reduction of overall interference. In contrast to other approaches MCExOR only needs one RF transceiver per device. We present algorithms for route discovery and packet forwarding. A significant benefit of MCExOR is that the selection of <b>RF</b> <b>channels</b> is independent of the routing function. Finally, with the help of simulations we show that MCExOR outperforms traditional protocols like ad-hoc on-demand distance vector routing through the simultaneous use of multiple <b>RF</b> <b>channels.</b> In combination with realistic radio propagation models an increase in the throughput is observed due to the opportunistic feature of MCExOR. With the increasing number of <b>RF</b> <b>channels</b> the overall throughput increases superproportionally. Unlike other multi channel approaches even a single packet flow can benefit from the existence of multiple channels...|$|R
25|$|Because the {{information}} {{collected by the}} MIDAS satellites was extraordinarily time-sensitive, the designers of the system could not use the film-canister dropping system that had been pioneered by the Discoverer/Corona/Samos series of reconnaissance satellites. In that system, the cameras aboard the satellites used photographic film capsules that physically re-entered the atmosphere before being retrieved mid-air by a military airplane. The MIDAS satellites would instead have to transmit their warning signals earthward via radio waves. Actual infrared images would not be transmitted due to the limited <b>RF</b> <b>channel</b> capacity that was available then. Instead, the satellite would simply send radio messages that it had detected a suspected missile launch {{as well as the}} time and location of the launch.|$|E

The dual–tracking RF front–end is composed of a few RF components that are duplicated to form the two <b>RF</b> <b>channels.</b> Employing a dual–channel Analogue–to–Digital Converter (ADC) enables synchronisation of the <b>RF</b> <b>channels</b> and minimises the errors resulting from the differences in the satellite clocks and the propagation delay between the two <b>RF</b> <b>channels.</b> The digitised GNSS signals are processed by two separate acquisition and tracking engines that are driven by the front–end’s master clock. This setup provides two synchronised receivers that are integrated onto one piece of hardware.

30|$|Multipath {{dispersion}} severely {{limits the}} diffuse channel bandwidth {{and a vast}} array of modulation, coding and equalization techniques have been applied to combat this effect [27, 89, 100 – 103]. An important aspect of these techniques is that amplitude constraints must also be imposed on all signals transmitted on OW channels, since the optical power signal must satisfy a non-negativity constraint. In addition, due to eye- and skin-safety requirements a limitation on the average optical power is also mandatory as imposed by international eye-safety limitations [13]. This power limitation is {{in stark contrast to the}} mean squared constraint in <b>RF</b> <b>channels.</b> As a result, the use of modulation and coding for <b>RF</b> <b>channels</b> directly on OW channels is seldom efficient and the unique power and bandwidth efficiency requirement of the OW channel must be considered in any communication system design [60].|$|R

40|$|Providing {{security}} {{guarantees for}} wireless communication {{is critically important}} for today's applications. While previous {{work in this area}} has concentrated on radio frequency (<b>RF)</b> <b>channels,</b> providing security guarantees for <b>RF</b> <b>channels</b> is inherently difficult because they are prone to rapid variations due small scale fading. Wireless optical communication, on the other hand, is inherently more secure than RF communication due to the intrinsic aspects of the signal propagation in the optical and near-optical frequency range. In this paper, secure communication over wireless optical links is examined by studying the secrecy capacity of a direct detection system. For the degraded Poisson wiretap channel, a closed-form expression of the secrecy capacity is given. A complete characterization of the general rate-equivocation region is also presented. For achievability, an optimal code is explicitly constructed by using the structured code designed by Wyner for the Poisson channel. The converse is proved in two different ways: the first method relies only on simple properties of the conditional expectation and basic information theoretical inequalities, whereas the second method hinges on the recent link established between minimum mean square estimation and mutual information in Poisson channels.
