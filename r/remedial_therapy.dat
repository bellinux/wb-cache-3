40|$|This study {{explored}} the potential value of alternating Philosophy with Picture Books (PB) within the Integrated Approach to Literacy Instruction (IATLI), to support two boys with dyslexia. PB was chosen in this explorative study {{because of its}} use of visual instruction, which a child with dyslexia is likely to respond more favourably to, because visual modes of learning is more complimentary to such learners. PB originates from the approach Philosophy with Children (P 4 C) that supports a pedagogy involving communicative virtues and collaborative thinking. Such attributes are likely to add value to an intervention as it {{may lead to the}} development of meta-cognitive strategies, which could both support and motivate their learning. The Integrated Approach to Literacy Instruction (IATLI) was also chosen in this explorative study because research suggests that children with dyslexia struggle with the acquisition of phonological awareness. One of the aims of the IATLI is to develop such a weakness. This study explores in particular how alternating the IALTI and PB could possibly add value in supporting two boys with dyslexia. The responses of both boys to the two approaches, in-depth interviews with both boys’ English teachers, and developmental diaries kept by the English teachers, the researcher, as well as the participants was analysed utilising thematic coding. In addition, pre and posttesting was administered and added to the triangulation of this study.

40|$|Aim of {{the study}} This {{research}} considered the clinical and organisational issues for integrative medicine from the multiple viewpoints of its primary stakeholders: GPs, Clinics, Patients and the CAM therapist, studying the interface between complementary and orthodox practitioners working together. Methodology Two National Health Service (NHS) primary care clinics were recruited and <b>remedial</b> massage <b>therapy</b> was made available to patients referred by their GPs. Action research methods then provided opportunities to study the working relationships through reflexive, inter-professional problem solving in clinic situations. Data collection included questionnaires, recorded interviews and meetings, case notes, field notes, reflexive journals, pictures, emails and letters. Results The reflexive cycles of action research identified practical problems and collaborative solutions within the clinic. Data highlighted aspects of IM relationships, for example clinical decision-making, organisational effects, inter-professional dynamics, and patient input. Whilst outcomes included improved patient satisfaction and enhanced GP-patient relationships, cycles of learning also suggested overarching barriers, particularly noting the mainly unstructured, ‘ad hoc’ relationships between CAM and orthodox professionals, {{and the lack of}} opportunities for meaningful inter-professional dialogue. Discussion and conclusions This research contributes an experiential perspective to the field of integrative medicine through action research, a collaborative and participative approach to investigate the complexities of best practice. Data indicate that CAM providers need to upgrade their dialogue with NHS practitioners and policy-makers and to negotiate structures that support IM within the NHS. Without the underpinning of more ‘structure’ and ‘dialogue’, working models of IM can be unstable and lacking in accountability...|$|R

This study compares three learning methods in a within-subject design by having 18 good and 18 poor 8 -year-old writers master unfamiliar, letter-like patterns by (1) tracing a trajectory on a screen, (2) tracking a moving target (pursuit), and (3) performing the pattern using written explicit instructions. Following each 10 -trial learning phase, the children completed a short test phase. Besides errors and kinematic data, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) was used to calculate the deviation for each pattern from the ideal shape (DTW-distance). As predicted, the number of errors and DTW-distance were very low during the learning phase of the tracing and pursuit conditions and higher in the explicit condition. Conversely, in the test phase, tracing yielded the highest DTW-distance and the explicit condition the lowest DTW-distance and error percentages.

Sixty adult Wistar rats were randomized into five groups: the control group (administration of saline), the morphine-only group (systematic administration of morphine without electrode implantation), the morphine-sham-stimulation group (systematic administration of morphine with electrode implantation but not given stimulation), the morphine-stimulation group (systematic administration of morphine with electrode implantation and stimulation) and the saline-stimulation group (administration of saline with electrode implantation and stimulation). The stimulation electrode was stereotaxically implanted into the core of unilateral NAc and microdialysis probes were unilaterally lowered into the ipsilateral ventral tegmental area (VTA), NAc, and ventral pallidum (VP). Samples from microdialysis probes in the ipsilateral VTA, NAc, and VP were analyzed for glutamate (Glu) and c-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The levels of Glu were increased in the ipsilateral NAc and VP of morphine-only group versus control group, whereas Glu levels were not significantly changed in the ipsilateral VTA.

The aim was to explore how eurythmy can support students with Asperger‟s Syndrome (AS) and Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The study attempts to place eurythmy into a larger framework of understanding through the examination of current research and to provide guidelines for eurythmy practitioners working with AS and ASD. The research methods used were participant observation and interviews, supplemented by data gathered from student self-assessment forms. Eurythmy was carried out on a one-to-one basis with seven students for 10 - 12 weeks. The observations made by the therapist and a second observer were compared with those of two eurythmy therapists working in similar contexts. Interviews were also held with college staff and with the seven students to obtain feedback on the effects of eurythmy and learn how the activity supports the practical-skills based educational approach of the college. The study identified predominant symptoms of bodily/movement difficulties in students with ASD and AS, such as lack of body awareness and control, disturbances of bodily/spatial orientation, problems of balance, rhythm, and a general lack of flexibility and fluidity. In the light of current research, which has shown that motor/sensory experiences provide the basis for perception, cognition, and the sense of self, the study concludes that this compromised motor/sensory development has repercussions on the students‟ ability to learn as well as on their self awareness and self esteem. Specific eurythmy exercises and techniques that support the students‟ engagement at the college are identified and described. The exercises were found to give students increased bodily awareness and control, and integrate the sense of touch, balance, proprioception, and movement. They helped the students exercise self-management skills, practice inner and outer „balance‟, handle their own „boundaries‟ more skilfully, and interact with others. Eurythmy improved their ability to focus and maintain attention, capacities necessary for engagement in other lessons. The findings indicate that eurythmy also brought about significant changes in the students‟ mood, inner attitude and emotional response, two of the main effects of eurythmy being a reduction of anxiety and a growing sense of confidence. These results are underpinned by comparison with the experience of other researchers and remedial practitioners...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundIn {{patients}} with Marfan syndrome, {{the complications of}} aortic degeneration, including dissection, aneurysm, and rupture represent {{the main cause of}} mortality. Although contemporary management of ascending aortic disease requires open surgical reconstruction, endovascular repair is now available for management of descending thoracic and abdominal aortic pathology (ie, thoracic endovascular aortic repair [TEVAR], endovascular aneurysm repair [EVAR]). The short- and long-term benefit of endovascular repair in Marfan patients remains largely unproven. We examine our outcomes after EVAR in this patient population. MethodsAll {{patients with}} a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome who were treated with TEVAR/EVAR were evaluated in a retrospective review. Perioperative, procedure-specific and patient covariate data were aggregated. Primary endpoints were overall mortality and procedural success as divided into three categories: (1) successful therapy, (2) primary failure, or (3) secondary failure. ResultsBetween 2000 and June 2010, 16 patients were identified as having undergone 19 TEVAR/EVAR procedures. These included three emergent operations (two for acute dissection/malperfusion and one for anastomotic disruption early after open repair). All 16 patients had previously undergone at least one (range, 1 - 5) open operation of the ascending aorta or arch at a time interval from 33 years to 1 week prior to the index endovascular repair. During a median follow-up of 9. 3 months (range, 0 - 46 months), there were four deaths (25 %). Six patients (38 %) had successful endovascular interventions. Despite early success, there was one death in this group at 1 month postintervention. Seven patients (44 %) experienced primary treatment failure with five undergoing open conversion and one undergoing left subclavian coil embolization (the seventh was lost to follow-up and presented 4 months later in cardiac arrest and expired without repair). There were three deaths in the primary treatment failure group. Two patients experienced secondary treatment failure. One underwent the index TEVAR for acute dissection with malperfusion and required a subsequent TEVAR for more distal aortic pathology. He is stable without disease progression. The other patient underwent open conversion after a second EVAR with four-vessel “chimney” stent grafts and is stable with his entire native aorta having been replaced. ConclusionsAortic disease associated with Marfan syndrome is a complex clinical problem and many patients require <b>remedial</b> procedures. Endovascular <b>therapy</b> can provide a useful adjunct or bridge to open surgical treatment in selected patients. However, failure of endovascular therapy is common, and its use should be judicious with close follow-up to avoid delay if open surgical repair is required...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the number}} of adopted {{children}} with special needs in the Netherlands has increased, while the total number of adopted children has declined. Because of this shift, adoption agency Meiling requested an exploratory study on the welfare of adopted {{children with special needs}}. In this study parents of adopted children from Taiwan have been questioned by using a digital questionnaire. The research question of this thesiswas: “Are there differences in the care of adopted children from Taiwan with and without special ?” To answer this question, the Leiden classification of special needs was used to specify the special needs. This classification focuses on physical/medical impairments of children. This resulted in two groups: 131 adopted children with special needs and 179 children without special needs. The results of this study showed that adopted children with special needs were more likely to show developmental delays than adopted children without special needs, both when they were placed for adoption and {{at the time of the}} study. Also, adopted children with special needs used more guidance and support from different agencies, such as physiotherapy, <b>remedial</b> teaching, speech <b>therapy,</b> and health care than adopted children without special needs. Adopted children with special needs attended special education more frequently and/or needed more additional adjustments in school than adopted children without special needs. Adoptive parents of children with special needs used health insurance, provided additional funding themselves, and received a personal budget (PGB) more often than adoptive parents of children without special needs. When adopted children with special needs from Taiwan were compared with adopted children with special needs from China (N = 189), the results showed that they did not differ in developmental delays at the time of placement nor at the moment of the study. However, adoptive parents of children with special needs from Taiwan more frequently used physical therapy, education and support around temporary assistance / care. From these findings, recommendations for practice are made, such as providing maternity care after the adoption, better collaboration between different agencies, specializing in adopted children with special needs by professionals and long-term follow-up care for adopted children with medical problems, possibly leading to developmental delay. Finally, it is concluded that further research is necessary to gain information about the development of adopted children with special needs.

The priority is given to the non sedative high potential neuroleptocytes. The group of basic sedative low potential neuroleptocytes should be avoid, because of the shown sedation, which has an negative influence towards the cognition and learning, which are already damaged in mentally retarded children. We treat conditions of neurotic of these children with “anksiolitici” and “tranklizeri”. We should be very cautions using these drugs from the group of “benzodiazemini”, because of the possibility of development of tolerance and possible dependency. According to the direct remedial actions under the retardation i. e. the attempts to improve them with different cerebral stimulate and vitamin preparations, there are different and opposite opinions for their benefit and justification. From one point of view there is a statement that these preparations are necessary in the frame of complete treatment of mentally retarded children, from another point of view there are statements that unluckily prove that there is still no evidence of their therapeutic effectiveness. We have paid more attention to the problem of antiepileptic therapy, which according to our notices, has indications for very frequent usage because the epileptic manifestations are the most accompanied symptomatology t. e. parallel disease of mentally retarded children. Remedial treatment of this disease is very serious and severe problem, that is why we have pointed out some important, practical notes that one should have on mind in the long term treatment.

(2) Clonal sequencing showed that 40 out of 46 MDR samples harbored mutations in the same HBV genome, and MDR mutations in the other 6 were in individual HBV genomes. Fifteen mutational patterns of MDR HBV strains were detected, including 10 both LAM-/LdT-and ADV-resistant mutations and 5 both ETV-and ADV-resistant mutations. (3) In vitrophenotypic analysis showed that combination use of ETV or LAM plus ADV efficiently inhibited the replication capacity of rtL 180 M+M 204 V+S 202 G+A 181 V MDR strain in HepG 2 cells, whereas the synergistic inhibitory effect was not observed in the wild-type strain. (4) Clinical drug usage showed that MDR HBV infection mainly emerged in patients receiving long-term sequential NAs therapy. Among them, 22 with LAM switched to ADV and 10 with LAM switched to ADV, followed by switching to ETV, and they successively developed virological and/or biochemical breakthrough. <b>Remedial</b> <b>therapy</b> consisting {{of a combination of}} LAM and ADV or ETV and ADV could effectively inhibit HBV replication to undetectable level in most patients harboring MDR HBV strains. Conclusions 　The MDR HBV strains isolated from Chinese patients display diversity and complexity. Phenotypic analysis and clinical observation support combined use of nucleoside and nucleotide analogs for control of MDR HBV infection. The development of MDR HBV is closely associated with sequential suboptimal NAs treatment. It is necessary to intensively monitor viral response and resistant mutations during NAs therapy for planning an optimal therapeutic schedule as early as possible...|$|E
40|$|This {{series is}} the first to {{approach}} the problem of language disability as a single field. It attempts to bring togeth,er areas of study which have traditionally been treated under separate headings, and to focus on the common problems of analysis, assessment and treatment which characterize them. Its scope therefore includes the specifically linguistic aspects of the work of such areas as speech <b>therapy,</b> <b>remedial</b> teaching, teaching ofthe deaf and educational psychology, as well as those aspects of mother-tongue and foreign-language teaching which pose similar problems. The research findings and practical techniques from each of these fields can inform the others, and we hope one of the main functions of this series will be to put people from one profession into contact with the analogous situations found in others. It is therefore not a series about specific syndromes or educationally narrow problems. While the orientation of a volume is naturally towards a single main area, and reflects an author's background, it is editorial policy to ask authors to consider the implications of what they say for the fields with which they have not been primarily concerned. Nor is this a series about disability in general. The medical, social, educational and other factors which enter into a comprehensive evaluation of any problems will not be studied as ends in themselves, but only in so far as they bear directly on the {{understanding of the nature of}} the language behaviour involved. The aim is to provide a much needed emphasis on the description and analysis oflanguage as such, and on the provision of specific techniques of therapy or remediation. In this way, we hope to bridge the gap between the theoretical discussion of 'causes' and the practical tasks of treatment-two sides oflanguage disability which it is uncommon to see systematically related. Despite restricting the area of disability to specifically linguistic matters-and in particular emphasizing problems of the production and comprehension of spoken language-it should be clear that the series' scope goes considerably beyond this. Forthe first books, we have selected topics which have been particularly neglected in recent years, and which seem most able to benefit from contemporary research in linguistics and its related disciplines, English studies, psychology, sociology and education. Each volume will put its subject matter in perspective, and will provide an introductory slant to its presentation. In this way, we hope to provide specialized studies which can be used as texts for components of teaching courses, as well as material that is directly applicable to the needs of professional workers. It is also hoped that this orientation will place the series within the reach of the interested layman-in particular, the parents or family of the linguistically disabled...|$|R
40|$|Stroke is a {{major health}} burden {{throughout}} Europe and consumes {{a large amount of}} health care resources. 1 Great differences exist in stroke management and outcome in Europe. Optimal models for delivery of stroke care, resulting in optimal outcome at reasonable cost are of great importance. 1 Our understanding of the components of inpatient stroke rehabilitation that are critical for patients’ outcome is still limited. Comparing practice and outcome across European countries may give clues that can help to develop new hypotheses and intervention strategies. Therefore, longitudinal long-term follow-up studies are needed to monitor the progress of individual patients, to assess the performance of hospital and community services and to evaluate intervention. 2 Optimally, such research should take place in a multi-centre study in a collaborative framework. The overall aim of this doctoral thesis was to identify components of inpatient stroke rehabilitation that have an impact on patients’ recovery. Therefore three studies were set up in four European rehabilitation centres (BE, UK, CH, DE). The findings of these studies are summarized below. In study 1, the use of time of stroke patients while in the rehabilitation centre was documented. In each centre, 60 patients were monitored during 30 time sampling sessions: 10 morning (7. 00 am- 12. 00 noon), 10 afternoon (12. 00 noon- 5. 00 pm) and 10 evening sessions (5. 00 pm- 10. 00 pm). Therapy time was minimal in the evening session. Therefore, the data of the evening sessions were not included in statistical analysis. The data of morning and afternoon sessions were analyzed with a generalized estimating equation model, controlling for serial dependency of the data and for confounders as age, initial motor and functional deficit. The main significant finding was that patients in the UK centre spent significantly less time in therapy compared to the other centres. The average absolute time in therapy was 1 hour in the UK centre, 2 hours in the Belgian centre, 2 hours 20 minutes in the German centre and 2 hours and 46 minutes in the Swiss centre. Low therapy time in the UK centre was in contrast to the time available for patients from all professional groups. A possible explanation may be the different division of tasks. Participant observations indicated that professionals in the UK centre spent more time in legally required administration, leaving less time for patient care. In all four centres, physiotherapy and occupational therapy together accounted for more than half the total therapy time. Compared with the other centres, patients in the UK centre spent less time in occupational therapy, but received more nursing care. This was probably the results of the high nurse staff levels. Sports-related activities and autonomous exercising were rarely observed in any centre, suggesting a potential for self-directed <b>remedial</b> <b>therapy.</b> Overall, this study revealed that in the participating centres, stroke patients spent a large amount of the day in their rooms, inactive, and without any interaction. Sitting, lying and sleeping accounted for a third to half of the day. The evidence that more intensive rehabilitation improves outcome after stroke 3 was not reflected in the rehabilitation practice observed. Still, great differences occurred across the centres with patients in the UK and Belgian centres spending less time in therapy compared to patients in the Swiss and German centres. The latter centres had a more structured rehabilitation program. This may have resulted in more therapy time and a more challenging environment for the patients, physically and mentally. Therapy time devoted to stroke patients in a rehabilitation setting seems to be more dependent on the management style than on the number of staff available. In study 2, the content of physiotherapy and occupational therapy for stroke patients was compared across the centres. First a scoring list was developed to define the content of individual physiotherapy and occupational therapy sessions for stroke patients. The therapeutic categories of the list were based on previous lists, 4, 5 neurological textbooks of stroke rehabilitation 6 and existing videotapes of physiotherapy and occupational therapy sessions with stroke patients, made in different European rehabilitation centres. The list was finalized considering the suggestions of five physiotherapists and five occupational therapists, who had more than two years of experience in the field of neurological rehabilitation. The final scoring list consisted of 12 categories and 46 subcategories. An inter-rater reliability study was carried out with the four researchers of the different centres. Comparing the frequency of occurrence of the categories resulted in intra-class correlation coefficients, indicating high reliability for eight categories, good reliability for one category, and fair for two categories. One category was not observed. The developed scoring list was a helpful and reliable tool to unravel and compare the content of individual physiotherapy and occupational therapy sessions for stroke patients in inpatient rehabilitation settings in various European countries. The results encourage further use of the list in future research and practice aiming to improve evidence-based stroke rehabilitation. In a second phase, the list was used to compare the content of physiotherapy and occupational therapy sessions between the four rehabilitation centres. Every researcher scored 15 physiotherapy and 15 occupational therapy sessions, recorded in their own centre. Patients with different impairments might receive different treatments. Therefore therapy sessions were recorded from stroke patients fitting predetermined clinical criteria. This was done to cover the full spectrum of potential disabilities and to ensure an equivalent patient group in each centre. Additionally the data was pooled over the centres to compare the content of both therapeutic disciplines. Data were analyzed using a generalized estimating equation model controlling for serial dependency of the data and for confounders as age and duration of the treatment session. Comparison of physiotherapy and occupational therapy between centres revealed significant differences for only two of the twelve categories. Ambulatory exercises occurred more often in the physiotherapy sessions in the Belgian and UK centres and relearning selective movements occurred less in the physiotherapy and occupational therapy sessions in the UK centre. Comparison of the two therapeutic disciplines on the pooled data of the four centres, revealed that ambulatory exercises, transfers, exercises & balance in standing and lying occurred significantly more often in the physiotherapy sessions. ADL, domestic and leisure activities and sensory, perceptual training & cognition occurred significantly more often in the occupational therapy sessions. This study revealed that the content of each therapeutic discipline was consistent between the four centres. Physiotherapy and occupational therapy proved to be distinct professions with clear demarcation of roles. In study 3, motor and functional recovery patterns were compared across centres. In the four centres, 532 stroke patients were recruited. On admission to the centre and at two, four and six months after stroke the Barthel Index (BI) 7 and Rivermead Motor Assessment-Gross Function (RMA-GF) 8 were assessed. At two, four and six months, also the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living (NEADL) 9 was assessed. The statistical comparison of the recovery patterns across centres over time required an adjustment for case-mix and a mechanism for handling missing data (intention-to-treat analysis). Two other issues that complicated the comparison were the skewed distribution of the outcome variables and the earlier baseline measurement in the UK centre compared to the other centres. Therefore random effects ordinal logistic models were used for the analysis. The results showed that patients in the UK centre {{were significantly more likely to}} stay in lower RMA-GF classes compared to patients in the German centre. In the Swiss centre, patients were significantly less likely to stay in lower NEADL classes compared to patients in the UK centre. These findings should be interpreted in view of the previous studies. In chapter 1, we found that overall therapy time in the UK centre was significantly less compared to the other three centers. 10 Also time in occupational therapy was significantly less in the UK, compared to the Swiss centre. In all centres, physiotherapy and occupational therapy comprised more than 50 % of therapeutic time. In the UK centre, 35 % of therapy time consisted of nursing care, which was more than in the other centres. In chapter 2, we reported that the content of physiotherapy and occupational therapy was consistent over the centres. The higher input of therapy in the Swiss and German centres was not related to higher staffing levels, but to a different time allocation of therapists and a strictly timed rehabilitation program for patients and therapists. This formal management led to a higher input of therapy, which in turn resulted in better motor and functional recovery for the patients. In contrast to the results for RMA-GF and NEADL, patients in the UK centre were significantly less likely to stay in lower BI classes compared to those in the German centre. This might be the result of the ceiling effect of the BI, the higher input of nursing care in the UK centre, the emphasis on self care to enable early discharge and the fact that middle band patients can expect more functional gain. 11 The recovery patterns of the Belgian patients did not differ significantly from patients in any other centre. In summary, motor and functional recovery in the Swiss and German centres was better compared to the UK centre, with exception of self care recovery in the UK centre. In the German and Swiss centres, patients received noticeably more therapy per day. This higher therapy input was not a consequence of higher staffing levels, but of a more efficient organization of rehabilitation services. This study indicates a potential for further improvement of the services in the UK and Belgian centres without additional cost. In study 4, the prevalence and predictors of post-stroke affective disorders were documented. Post-stroke depression and anxiety were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) 12 at two, four and six months after stroke. Based on the original publication, a score > 7 on HADS-depression or anxiety subscale (range 0 - 21) was considered to reflect the syndrome of depression or anxiety, respectively. 12 Prevalence and severity were compared across centres using Chi² and Kruskal-Wallis tests, respectively. Predictors and time course of severity of depression and anxiety were examined using linear mixed models on the pooled data. Of the 532 patients enrolled in the study, the HADS was not completed at any time for 27 patients. Consequently, 505 patients were included in the analysis. Overall the prevalence of depression at the several evaluation points varied between 21 % and 39 %. The overall prevalence of anxiety ranged between 15 % and 30 %. There was no significant difference in the prevalence or severity of both affective disorders between centres. Therefore we pooled the data from the four centres to examine if the high proportion of depressed and anxious patients at each time point comprised the same individuals. Results showed that patients reporting an affective disorder at six months comprised only half those with an onset before two months. The other half had a later onset. Linear mixed models analyses showed that stroke severity, functional disability, motor impairment and baseline sensory deficit were univariate predictors of severity of both depression and anxiety. Additionally baseline cognitive disorder, dysarthria, pre-stroke Barthel index and age were associated with the severity of depression. In the multivariate models only the initial Barthel Index was retained. After correction for predictive factors, levels of depression were stable over time, while anxiety levels decreased slightly. In conclusion, this study showed that the prevalence and severity of affective disorders after stroke was similar in the four European centres. Monitoring for affective disorders is crucial as many patients risk becoming depressed or anxious in the first 6 months after stroke. The multivariate models suggest a relationship between emotional distress and functional disability after stroke. References 1. Markus H.
