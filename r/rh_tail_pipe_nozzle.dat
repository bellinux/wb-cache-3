40|$|It is {{standard}} practice in one-dimensional gasdynamic simulations of high performance twostroke engines {{to model the}} exhaust <b>tail</b> <b>pipe</b> entry as an area change using an algorithm similar to the area change of the reverse cone. In the reverse cone the area continually steps down while at the <b>tail</b> <b>pipe</b> entry it changes from stepping down to constant area. At this point a vena contracta can form that effects the flow resistance of the <b>tail</b> <b>pipe.</b> In an effort to improve {{the accuracy of the}} gasdynamic simulations the area change algorithm at the <b>tail</b> <b>pipe</b> entry was replaced with a restriction algorithm that incorporates a coefficient of discharge and allows an increase in entropy on the expansion side. The coefficient of discharge is defined as the actual measured mass flow divided by the mass flow predicted by the restriction algorithm. An experimental set up was designed and constructed to measure mass flows for a variety of <b>tail</b> <b>pipe</b> entry geometries at a range of pressures covering the pressure ratios encountered in a real engine. From the mass flow results the coefficients of discharge for a range of pressure and area ratios and reverse cone angles could be calculated and arranged into matrix form to define Cd-maps.

50|$|And in most muffler applications, Si and So, {{the area}} of the exhaust <b>pipe</b> and <b>tail</b> <b>pipe,</b> are {{generally}} made equal, thus we have:Thus, TL equals 20 times the logarithm (to the base 10) of the ratio of the acoustic pressure associated with the incident wave (in the exhaust pipe) and that of the transmitted wave (in the <b>tail</b> <b>pipe),</b> with the two pipes having the same cross-sectional area and the <b>tail</b> <b>pipe</b> terminating anechoically. However this anechoic condition is normally difficult to meet under practical industry environment, thus it is usually more convenient for the muffler manufacturers to measure insertions loss during their muffler performance tests under working conditions (mounted on an engine).|$|R
40|$|In {{this current}} work it is {{presented}} the two-dimensional axisymmetrical air flow simulations under laminar regime in a conical diffuser using Computer Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The use of diffusers in laminar flow {{can be seen in}} micro-pumps applications, especially for micro-electronics cooling. The objective is to analyze the static pressure recovery coefficient (Cp) for Reynolds 64, varying the diffuser expansion angle and the diffuser exit/entrance area ratio (A 2 /A 1 = 1. 5 and 2. 0) for the cases with and without <b>tail</b> <b>pipe.</b> The diffuser geometric configurations and the Cp formulation are based in the current ESDU 73024 (Engineering Sciences Data Unit) publication. The partial differential equations system (Continuity and Navier-Stoke) was solved using a computer program based in the numerical Finite Element method. For diffusers without <b>tail</b> <b>pipe</b> (A 2 /A 1 = 1. 5 and 2. 0), the Cp values under turbulent flow are higher than Cp values under laminar flow for the same expansion angles. For diffuser with <b>tail</b> <b>pipe</b> (A 2 /A 1 = 1. 5 and 2. 0), the Cp values under turbulent flow are higher than Cp values under laminar flow up to 18 diffuser expansion angle. Above 18, the Cp for turbulent and laminar flow follow a similar trend. For diffuser (A 2 /A 1 = 1. 5 and 2. 0) under turbulent flow with and without <b>tail</b> <b>pipe,</b> the Cp results were similar up to 10 diffuser expansion angle. Above 10, the diffusers with <b>tail</b> <b>pipe</b> presented Cp results higher than diffusers without <b>tail</b> <b>pipe.</b> The same occurs for diffuser (A 2 /A 1 = 1. 5 and 2. 0) under laminar flow with and without <b>tail</b> <b>pipe.</b> Therefore, the finite element method showed a good agreement to solve this kind of problem and the results are important once static pressure recovery coefficient data for laminar flow is scarce in the literature...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} and reported that in pulse combustors of Helmholtz type the heat transfer is two to five times higher than expected. From experiments, where the temperature profile in the <b>tail</b> <b>pipe</b> of a pulse combustor has been measured, we have no indication why the heat transfer should be enhanced. In the <b>tail</b> <b>pipe</b> of a pulse combustor the radial component of the temperature gradient vanishes in {{the main part of}} the of the cross-section of the <b>tail</b> <b>pipe</b> except close to the boundary of the pipe. Evidently, a temperature drop along the <b>tail</b> <b>pipe</b> of up to 500 degrees C/m, indicates that the classical linear constitutive assumption of heat conduction, i. e. Fourier's law, is incapable of describing the phenomenon observed. A powerful coupling between the oscillating velocity field and the oscillating temperature field might be able to explain the observed enhanced heat conduction. In Fourier's law neither a direct dependence of the heat conduction on the velocity and the velocity gradient, nor an interaction between the velocity and temperature field is given. A first extension would be to introduce a more general constitutive relation for the heat conduction vector. For that reason, in order to describe the observed phenomenon, a new non-linear constitutive relation for the heat conduction vector has been suggested. An additional term, dependent on the velocity gradient operating on the temperature gradient, will effect the heat transfer. To be able to examine the consequences of the new nonlinear constitutive relation suggested, a thermo-mechanical pulsating flow between two parallel plates is considered. By approximating the general constitutive equations in the postulated general equations of motion, analytical solutions of the velocity and temperature fields can be found to be in good agreement with experimental results. The analytical expressions for the velocity and temperature profiles can then be used in the estimation of the heat transfer, which can be compared with experimental observations...|$|R
