5|$|ARCHER is {{a daytime}} {{non-invasive}} technology, which works by analyzing an object’s <b>reflected</b> <b>light.</b> It cannot detect objects at night, underwater, under dense cover, underground, under snow or inside buildings. The system uses a special camera facing down through a quartz glass portal {{in the belly}} of the aircraft, which is typically flown at a standard mission altitude of 2500feet (800meters) and 100 knots (50meters/second) ground speed.|$|E

5|$|Iron(III) chloride, {{also called}} ferric chloride, is an {{industrial}} scale commodity chemical compound, with the formula FeCl3 and with iron in the +3 oxidation state. The colour of iron(III) chloride crystals {{depends on the}} viewing angle: by <b>reflected</b> <b>light</b> the crystals appear dark green, but by transmitted light they appear purple-red. Anhydrous iron(III) chloride is deliquescent, forming hydrated hydrogen chloride mists in moist air. It is rarely observed in its natural form, the mineral molysite, known mainly from some fumaroles.|$|E

5|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{a medical}} imaging technique using low-coherence interferometry to provide tomographic visualization of internal tissue microstructures. As seen in Fig.22, {{the core of a}} typical OCT system is a Michelson interferometer. One interferometer arm is focused onto the tissue sample and scans the sample in an X-Y longitudinal raster pattern. The other interferometer arm is bounced off a reference mirror. <b>Reflected</b> <b>light</b> from the tissue sample is combined with <b>reflected</b> <b>light</b> from the reference. Because of the low coherence of the light source, interferometric signal is observed only over a limited depth of sample. X-Y scanning therefore records one thin optical slice of the sample at a time. By performing multiple scans, moving the reference mirror between each scan, an entire three-dimensional image of the tissue can be reconstructed. Recent advances have striven to combine the nanometer phase retrieval of coherent interferometry with the ranging capability of low-coherence interferometry.|$|E
5|$|Although Etty had {{traditionally}} {{worked in}} the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of <b>reflected</b> <b>light</b> on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, {{and closer to the}} style of Titian. This is likely owing {{to the nature of the}} subject matter. Until then his history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical mythology, and took place in brightly lit Mediterranean settings. The Seasons, by contrast, was seen as an explicitly English work, requiring a more muted palette to deal with the typical lighting conditions of Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{effects of}} light only {{last for a}} few minutes, thus the canvases documenting such ephemera {{received}} attention {{for no more than}} a few minutes a day. Further complicating matters, the light of subsequent sunrises, for example, could alter substantially and would require separate canvases within the series. Subsequently, different hues are evident in each painting, and in each work, color is used to describe not only direct but <b>reflected</b> <b>light.</b> At differing times of day and in various seasons stacks absorb the light from diverse parts of the color spectrum. As a result, the residual light that is reflected off of the stacks is seen as ever-changing, and manifests in distinctive coloring.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter is {{the fifth}} planet from the Sun and {{the largest in the}} Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but {{two and a half times}} that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune are ice giants. Jupiter has been known to astronomers since antiquity. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an {{apparent}} magnitude of −2.94, bright enough for its <b>reflected</b> <b>light</b> to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.|$|E
5|$|Once a colossus is found, {{the player}} must {{discover}} its weaknesses to defeat it. Each colossus dwells {{in a unique}} lair, and many colossi cannot be defeated without making use of the surrounding environment. Every colossus {{has at least one}} weak point, indicated by a glowing sigil that can be illuminated and identified by the sword's <b>reflected</b> <b>light.</b> Each colossus has areas covered with fur or protruding ledges, which Wander may use to grip and scale the colossus while it thrashes about in an attempt to dislodge him. While scaling a colossus, the player must act quickly, as Wander has a limited stamina gauge that decreases while he hangs onto the creature.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of {{slow lorises}} are forward-facing, which gives stereo vision. Their eyes {{are large and}} possess a {{reflective}} layer, called the tapetum lucidum, that improves low-light vision. It is possible that this layer blurs the images they see, as the <b>reflected</b> <b>light</b> may interfere with the incoming light. Slow lorises have monochromatic vision, meaning they see in shades of only one color. They lack the opsin gene {{that would allow them}} to detect short wavelength light, which includes the colors blue and green.|$|E

5|$|There {{are some}} {{circumstances}} {{where this is}} not the case, and it is desirable to make the width of the transition line larger than the Doppler profile. For instance, when tracking a quickly accelerating object, the band-pass of the ALF must include within it the maximum and minimum values for the <b>reflected</b> <b>light.</b> The accepted method for increasing the band-pass involves placing an inert gas in the vapor cell. This gas both widens the spectral line and increases the transmission rate of the filter.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{hypothesis}} was put forth that argued the impactor {{that killed the}} dinosaurs belonged to the Baptistina family of asteroids. Concerns have been raised regarding the reputed link, in part because very few solid observational constraints exist of the asteroid or family. Indeed, it was recently discovered that 298 Baptistina does not share the same chemical signature {{as the source of}} the K–Pg impact. Although this finding may make the link between the Baptistina family and K–Pg impactor more difficult to substantiate, it does not preclude the possibility. A 2011 Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, (WISE), study of <b>reflected</b> <b>light</b> from the asteroids of the family estimated the break-up at 80Ma, giving it insufficient time to shift orbits and impact the Earth by 66Ma.|$|E
5|$|The {{scales on}} {{butterfly}} wings are pigmented with melanins {{that can produce}} the colours black and brown. The white colour in the butterfly family Pieridae is a derivative of uric acid, an excretory product. Bright blues, greens, reds and iridescence are usually created not by pigments but through the microstructure of the scales. This structural coloration {{is the result of}} coherent scattering of light by the photonic crystal nature of the scales. The specialised scales that provide structural colours to <b>reflected</b> <b>light</b> mostly produce ultra-violet patterns which are discernible {{in that part of the}} ultra-violet spectrum that lepidopteran eyes can see. The structural colour seen is often dependent upon the angle of view. For example, in Morpho cypris, the colour from the front is a bright blue but when seen from an angle changes very quickly to black.|$|E

5|$|The use of Yehudi {{lights to}} {{camouflage}} aircraft by matching their luminance with the background sky was developed, in part, by the US Navy's Project Yehudi from 1943 onwards, following pioneering {{experiments in the}} Canadian diffused lighting camouflage project for ships early in the Second World War. A Canadian professor, Edmund Godfrey Burr, had serendipitously stumbled upon the principle when he saw an aircraft coming in to land over snow suddenly vanish; {{he realized that the}} <b>reflected</b> <b>light</b> had increased its brightness just enough to match the background sky. The ships were fitted with ordinary projectors mounted on small platforms fixed to their sides, with the projectors pointing inwards at the ship's side. The brightness was adjusted to match the brightness of the sky. The Canadian experiment showed that such counter-illumination camouflage was possible, arousing interest in both Britain and America, but the equipment was cumbersome and fragile, and neither the Royal Canadian Navy nor their allies brought it into production.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{biosphere}} {{has significantly}} altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved , forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today. This change enabled {{the proliferation of}} aerobic organisms and, indirectly, {{the formation of the}} ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3. The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land. Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature. This last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18°C, in contrast to the current +15°C, and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be <b>reflected</b> <b>light</b> from ice crystals in the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|In 1848–49, Hippolyte Fizeau {{determined}} {{the speed of}} light between an intense light source and a mirror about 8km distant. The light source was interrupted by a rotating cogwheel with 720 notches that could be rotated at a variable speed of up to hundreds of times a second. (Figure1) Fizeau adjusted the rotation speed of the cogwheel until light passing through one notch of the cogwheel would be completely eclipsed by the adjacent tooth. Spinning the cogwheel at 3, 5 and 7 times this basic rotation rate also resulted in eclipsing of the <b>reflected</b> <b>light</b> by the cogwheel teeth next in line. Given the rotational speed of the wheel and the distance between the wheel and the mirror, Fizeau was able to calculate a value of 315000km/s for {{the speed of light}}. It was difficult for Fizeau to visually estimate the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, and his value for light's speed was about 5% too high. Fizeau's paper appeared in Comptes Rendus: Hebdomadaires de scéances de l’Academie de Sciences (Paris, Vol. 29 , pp.90–92).|$|E

This technique causes all closed polygons (such as a triangle within a 3D mesh) to <b>reflect</b> <b>light</b> equally in all directions when rendered. In effect, a point rotated around its normal vector will not change the way it <b>reflects</b> <b>light.</b> However, the point will change the way it <b>reflects</b> <b>light</b> if it is tilted away from its initial normal vector since the area is illuminated by a smaller fraction of the incident radiation.

This number is then multiplied by the color of the surface and the intensity of the light hitting the surface: ...|$|R
5|$|The nymph is the {{dominant}} life history stage of the mayfly. Different insect species vary in their tolerance to water pollution, but in general, the larval stages of mayflies, stoneflies (Plecoptera) and caddis flies (Trichoptera) are susceptible {{to a number of}} pollutants including sewage, pesticides and industrial effluent. In general, mayflies are particularly sensitive to acidification, but tolerances vary, and certain species are exceptionally tolerant to heavy metal contamination and to low pH levels. Ephemerellidae are among the most tolerant groups and Siphlonuridae and Caenidae the least. The adverse effects on the insects of pollution may be either lethal or sub-lethal, in the latter case resulting in altered enzyme function, poor growth, changed behaviour or lack of reproductive success. As important parts of the food chain, pollution can cause knock-on effects to other organisms; a dearth of herbivorous nymphs can cause overgrowth of algae, and a scarcity of predacious nymphs can result in an over-abundance of their prey species. Fish that feed on mayfly nymphs that have bioaccumulated heavy metals are themselves at risk. Adult female mayflies find water by detecting the polarization of <b>reflected</b> <b>light.</b> They are easily fooled by other polished surfaces which can act as traps for swarming mayflies.|$|E
