40|$|Adding and {{removing}} liquid from socket bladders {{is a means}} for people with limb loss to accommodate residual-limb volume change. We fit 19 people with transtibial amputation using their regular prosthetic socket with fluid bladders on the inside socket surface to undergo cycles of bladder liquid addition and removal. In each cycle, subjects sat, stood, and walked for 90 s with bladder liquid added, and then sat, stood, and walked for 90 s again with the bladder liquid removed. The amount of bladder liquid added was increased in each cycle. We used bioimpedance analysis to measure residual-limb fluid volume. Results showed that the preferred bladder liquid volume was 16. 8 +/– 8. 4 mL (mean +/– standard deviation), corresponding with 1. 7 % +/– 0. 8 % of the average socket volume between the bioimpedance voltage-sensing electrodes. Residual-limb fluid volume driven out {{of the residual limb}} when bladder liquid was added was typically not recovered upon subsequent bladder liquid removal. Of the 19 subjects, 15 experienced a gradual residual-limb fluid volume loss over the test session. Care should be taken when implementing adjustable socket technologies in people with limb loss. <b>Reducing</b> <b>socket</b> volume may accentuate residual-limb fluid volume loss...|$|E
40|$|This article {{reports the}} design, {{realisation}} and preliminary testing of an innovative multisensor controlled prosthetic hand. The mechanical design is strongly oriented {{to satisfy the}} requirements of delivery a penta-digital prosthetic hand with reduced hand size, low weight, independent finger movement and bio-mimetic shape. Moreover, an ad hoc sensing architecture has been designed including traditional EMG system together with in socket force measurement and inertial sensing. This sensing architecture is intended to <b>reduce</b> the <b>socket</b> complexity in terms of adaptation to different patient forearms, without loosing the possibility of performing multiple hand grips. An innovative concept introducing inertial sensing in order to select appropriate robotic hand configurations is also described. A first prototype of the prosthetic hand has been realised and preliminary tests are reported...|$|R
30|$|Barbosa et al. {{described}} an alternative technique which minimizes suture in the bony socket, proposing that suture wrapping the tendon in the bony <b>socket</b> <b>reduces</b> the bone-tendon contact area crucial for biologic {{integration of the}} graft (Barbosa et al., 2017). Their technique eliminates the cerclage suture {{at both ends of}} the graft in favor of directly suturing the whip-stitched free ends to the Fiber Loop. Unfortunately, a biomechanical evaluation of the technique was not conducted, which would be an important consideration in the clinical use of this model.|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} intraalveolar placement of gel containing 0. 2 % chlorhexidine and 10 gm of metronidazole on the incidence of alveolar osteitis. A total of 300 impacted third molars were extracted in 150 patients enrolled in this trial. In each subject a socket was randomly selected and packed to the crest of alveolar ridge with the gel. The contralateral socket was packed with placebo dressing. The occurrence of dry socket was assessed during 3 rd and 5 th postoperative days. The data was analysed using a meta analytical program. Double blind, prospective, placebo controlled trial. The combination of metronidazole + chlorhexidine gel significantly <b>reduced</b> dry <b>socket</b> incidence from 22. 6 % to 6. 6 % (P ≤ 0. 001) [McNemar and chi-square tests]. The decrease in incidence of adverse reactions and complications related to local application of metronidazole and chlorhexidine gel explains its clinical use, specifically in mandibular molar extractions where the chances of dry sockets are high...|$|R
30|$|The 5  mm borer {{requires}} smaller torque for coring. Due to its smaller reaction force, we used thinner reaction bar {{of smaller}} diameter and a lighter square drive <b>socket,</b> <b>reducing</b> the total weight to 6.0  kg (Table  1). Due {{to the larger}} torque required for sampling 12  mm cores, we had to increase the total weight of the device for sampling 12  mm cores to 9.5  kg. The rotation speed of the bit stayed almost constant irrespective of penetration depth and the wood species sampled. Using the gear ratios of 1 : 24 and 1 : 118, the penetration speeds of the 5 and 12  mm bits were approximately 50  cm and 12  cm per min, respectively (Table  1).|$|R
50|$|A normal {{integrated}} circuit (IC) socket requires the IC {{to be pushed}} into sprung contacts which then grip by friction. For an IC with hundreds of pins, the total insertion force can be very large (hundreds of newtons), leading to a danger of damage to the device or the circuit board. Also, even with relatively small pin counts, each pin extraction is fairly awkward and carries a significant risk of bending pins, particularly if the person performing the extraction hasn't had much practice or if the board is crowded. Low insertion force (LIF) <b>sockets</b> <b>reduce</b> the issues of insertion and extraction, but because of its lower insertion force than a conventional socket, are likely to produce less reliable connections.|$|R
40|$|Implant {{placement}} in maxillary anterior region has most aesthetic challenges in implant dentistry because tooth loss lead to bone resorption and collapse of gingival architecture, {{which lead to}} aesthetic compromise and inadequate bone for implant placement. Immediate implant {{placement in}}to fresh extraction <b>socket</b> <b>reduces</b> the treatment time, cost, preserved the gingival aesthetic and increases {{the comfort of the}} patient. This article describes the procedure for immediate implant placement in fresh extraction socket and early loading of implant with zirconia crown. Clinical and radiographic examination revealed width and length of the tooth for selecting implant size and design. Cement retained zirconia crown was used for early loading. Implant was successfully loaded and was functional during 36 months follow up period. Immediate placement and early loading of dental implant provides advantages like fewer surgical procedures, shorter treatment time, and improved aesthetic and psychological confidence...|$|R
40|$|Alveolar atrophy {{following}} {{tooth extraction}} remains {{a challenge for}} future dental implant placement. Immediate implant placement and postextraction alveolar preservation are 2 methods {{that are used to}} prevent significant postextraction bone loss. In this article, we report the management of a maxillary tooth extraction socket using an alveolar pres-ervation technique involving placement of a cone of beta-tricalcium phosphate (ß-TCP) combined with type I collagen without the use of barrier membranes or flap surgery. Clinical examination revealed solid new bone formation 9 months after the procedure. At the time of implant placement, histomorphometric analysis of the biopsied bone showed that it contained 62. 6 % mineralized bone, 21. 1 % bone marrow and 16. 3 % residual ß-TCP graft. The healed bone was able to support subsequent dental implant placement and loading. After tooth extraction, the residual al-veolar ridge generally provides lim-ited bone volume because of ongoing, progressive bone resorption. 1 Healing events within postextraction <b>sockets</b> <b>reduce</b> the di...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Interface {{pressures}} {{were measured}} during ambula-tion {{with a normal}} total-surface weight-bearing suction socket and a vacuum-assisted socket. The vacuum-assisted socket {{has been shown to}} eliminate daily volume loss. Urethane liners were instrumented with five force-sensing resistors to measure positive pressures and one air pressure sensor at the distal end of the liner to document negative pressures. Nine unilateral tran-stibial amputees participated in the study. The vacuum-assisted socket created significantly lower positive-pressure impulse (42. 8, 39. 6 kPa•s) and peak pressures (83. 5, 80. 0 kPa) during the stance phase. The pressure impulse (– 10. 5, – 13. 3 kPa•s), average (– 21. 2, – 26. 5 kPa), and peak (– 28. 5, – 36. 3 kPa) nega-tive pressures during swing phase were significantly greater in magnitude with the vacuum-assisted socket. We believe that lower positive pressures seen during stance using the vacuum-assisted <b>socket</b> <b>reduces</b> the fluid forced out and greater negative pressures seen during swing increases the amount of fluid drawn into the limb, thereby preventing volume loss...|$|R
500|$|The {{skull of}} the holotype, which {{measures}} [...] long, {{is long and}} narrow, with a tapered snout that slopes downwards at an angle of 15°. The eye sockets were roughly {{the same size as}} the temporal openings immediately behind them. A narrow, rounded ridge along the middle of the top surface of the skull extends from near the front of the premaxilla to the back of the eye sockets. The frontal bones form a rectangular bar that separates the eye sockets down the middle. A ridge running across the bar intersects with the forward-extending ridge to produce a dagger-shaped protrusion. The jugal bone, which extends from the bottom of the eye socket back to the level of the temporal openings, is entirely bordered on its bottom by the maxilla. The squamosal bones arch around to form the curved back of the skull, and bear a ridge on top for attachment of neck muscles. There is also a ridge at the point where the two bones fuse. A cast of the braincase shows impressions of the semicircular canals and membranous inner ear, as well as canals of the hypoglossal, accessory, glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves, which can also be observed on the bony exoccipital-opisthotic of the braincase. On the imperfectly-preserved lower jaw, the coronoid eminence seems to be relatively low, judging by the narrow and slightly curved top edge of the surangular bone. While the teeth have been lost, they were initially described as long, slender, and awl-shaped, with rough ridges on the outer surfaces. Although it has been suggested that Brancasaurus had very <b>reduced</b> tooth <b>sockets</b> in the premaxilla, as in Leptocleidus, this is impossible to verify because of damage to this portion of the skull.|$|R
50|$|The Stoner 63 {{series of}} weapons are gas-operated, air-cooled, belt or magazine-fed and in rifle and carbine configuration, fire from a closed bolt to ensure maximum accuracy, or in machine gun mode, {{fire from the}} open bolt {{position}} to prevent cook-offs and enhance cooling. The weapon has a rotary bolt locking mechanism with 7 radially symmetrical locking lugs that engage a series of recesses in the barrel extension, and is actuated by a conventional long-stroke piston. The radial arrangement of locking lugs distributes the firing load evenly around the bolt head and barrel <b>socket,</b> <b>reducing</b> stress and increasing the longevity of these critical components. Attached to the piston extension is the bolt carrier which {{is equipped with a}} curved cam track that guides the bolt's cam pin (retained by the firing pin) and rotates the bolt 22.5° during the movement of the piston to either lock or unlock the bolt from behind the abutments in the barrel socket. Incorporated into the bolt carrier/piston group is an anti-bounce device, consisting of a 4 in carbide rod that rides within the piston extension’s hollow interior and moves back and forth during the recoil and counter-recoil cycles, reducing bolt bounce and preventing the possibility of firing out of battery during closed bolt firing (in the Rifle/Carbine models).|$|R
40|$|Background: Individuals {{who have}} {{undergone}} a transfemoral amputation (TFA) due to causes other than peripheral vascular disease (PVD) constitute a sub-group of all amputees. This group is usually of young {{age at the}} amputation. Conventionally, prosthetic suspension is achieved with a socket. Using the osseointegration method, prostheses can be attached directly to the bone (OI prostheses) without a socket. Aim: The overall aim {{was to investigate the}} health-related quality of life (HRQL) and prosthetic function in persons with a unilateral TFA, due to causes other than PVD, with socket prostheses and OI prostheses. Material, methods and results: General HRQL was assessed using the SF- 36. For condition-specific HRQL, a new self-report questionnaire was constructed: the Questionnaire for Individuals with a Transfemoral Amputation (Q-TFA). It provides results for four scores (prosthetic use, prosthetic mobility, problems and global health) and adequate levels of validity and reliability were demonstrated (Paper II). Physical assessments included measurement of the energy cost using the Physiological Cost Index and hip range of motion (ROM). The HRQL and prosthetic function are described for 97 persons (62 % male, 38 % female, mean age 48 years, mean time since amputation 22 years, cause: 55 % trauma, 35 % tumour, 10 % other) (Paper I). The energy cost was investigated for 41 individuals with socket prostheses (Paper III), while hip ROM was investigated for 43 persons with socket prostheses and 20 with OI prostheses (Paper IV). Finally, prospective results at the two-year follow-up for the first 18 consecutive patients treated with an OI prosthesis within a clinical investigation are reported (Paper V). For the study group (Paper I), the general HRQL was reduced compared with healthy norms. Daily use of the socket prosthesis was reported by 82 %. A large number of subjective complaints reducing the HRQL were reported. The most common were heat/perspiration (72 %) and sores/skin irritation (62 %) with the socket. Further, 48 % reported phantom limb pain, 47 % back pain and 44 % uncomfortable sitting with the prosthesis. The energy cost was increased by 77 % compared with controls. The hip ROM was <b>reduced</b> with the <b>socket</b> prosthesis, while individuals with an OI prosthesis had no restriction in hip ROM. Prospective results for the treatment with OI prostheses revealed that 17 / 18 used the prosthesis and reported an increase in general physical HRQL and more prosthetic use, better prosthetic mobility, fewer problems and better global health at the two-year follow-up compared with the preoperative situation. Conclusions: For persons with an established TFA, for reasons other than PVD, the general HRQL is lower than that of healthy norms and a considerable number of specific problems are perceived. The Q-TFA is a valid and reliable tool for assessments of this population. Treatment with OI prostheses represents a promising development in the rehabilitation of individuals with TFA who report improved general and condition-specific HRQL at the two-year follow-up...|$|R
