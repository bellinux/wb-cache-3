50|$|US-25E departs Pineville {{and heads}} northwest, {{indirectly}} serving Tinsley via KY 92, crossing into Knox County, and bypassing Flat Lick to the west. The route makes an S-shaped curve, dipping south then turning back northwest as it approaches Barbourville. After serving {{the east side}} of Barbourville, the highway passes near Heidrick and <b>runs</b> <b>through</b> Baileys <b>Switch.</b>|$|R
50|$|New Shannock Switch is {{separated}} from the larger village of Shannock by the Pawcatuck River, which divides the towns of Richmond and Charlestown. Amtrak's Northeast Corridor <b>runs</b> <b>through</b> New Shannock <b>Switch</b> after leaving Shannock. After running through the village it crosses the Pawcatuck again, reentering Richmond {{in the village of}} Kenyon.|$|R
2500|$|Further west, {{there was}} an {{absolute}} three-aspect signal, [...] east of the switch at Dalehurst that showed three solid-red lamps, indicating a stop. [...] The freight still did not slow down, instead running through the DCS and entering the section of single track occupied by the Super Continental. [...] Had the Super Continental been even a minute early, {{it would have been}} past the DCS at this point, but it was not. [...] Seconds after the freight <b>ran</b> <b>through</b> the <b>switch,</b> at 8:40am, the two trains collided.|$|R
50|$|For CPR's {{purposes}} these ports had {{two major}} problems. One {{was that the}} rail lines all ran south, where they connected to mainlines that <b>ran</b> <b>through</b> Toronto and <b>switched</b> near Bathurst Street. Only one of the lines in the southern Ontario area avoided Toronto and was ideally placed; the Midland Railway of Canada (MR) ran around {{the eastern side of}} Lake Simcoe and connected to the Lake Ontario mainlines at Port Hope. Unfortunately, the PHL&B was already leased by the GTR, who proved uninterested in sharing when a deal was attempted in 1902.|$|R
2500|$|Shortly after 6 a.m. on August 10, 1958, {{a string}} of {{a dozen or more}} cement cars and a caboose broke loose from Port Morris Wye, {{beginning}} what was likely among the longest runaways in North American railroading history. The crew of the East End Drill was awaiting orders to move the cars when they began to drift westbound down the grade. Engineless, the cars <b>ran</b> <b>through</b> a <b>switch</b> and onto the eastbound track of the Cut-Off, beginning a [...] journey that reached a top speed of perhaps [...] or more. A chase locomotive was dispatched from Port Morris in a futile attempt to try to catch the cars. [...] Within a half-hour the string had derailed at the sharp (...) curve at Point of Gap in the Delaware Water Gap, falling into the Delaware River at approximately the same location as the 1948 accident. [...] No one was injured, although an eastbound freight quickly took Greendell siding just ahead of the runaway cars, narrowly avoiding a catastrophic collision. [...] The runaway was blamed on a worker who had not properly set the brakes.|$|R
50|$|Early {{cartridges}} were 2 KB ROMs for the Atari 2600 and 4 KB for Intellivision. This {{upper limit}} grew steadily from 1978 to 1983: up to 16 KB for Atari 5200 and Intellivision, 32 KB for ColecoVision. Bank switching, {{a technique that}} allowed two {{different parts of the}} program to use the same memory addresses, was required for the larger cartridges to work. Atari 2600 carts got as large as 32k (Final <b>Run)</b> <b>through</b> bank <b>switching.</b> In contrast, some Arcadia family members (e.g. Palladium Video-Computer-Game) supported up to 31 KB without any need for bank switching. In the game consoles, high RAM prices, especially during the early period of the second generation, limited the RAM (memory) capacity of the systems to a tiny amount, often less than 1 KB. Although the cartridge ROM size limit grew steadily, the RAM limit was part of the console itself, and all games had to work within its constraints. In the case of the especially constrained Atari 2600, which had only 128 Bytes of RAM available in the console, a few late game cartridges contained a special combined RAM/ROM chip, thus adding another 256 bytes of RAM inside the cartridge itself.|$|R

A chase locomotive was dispatched from Port Morris in a futile attempt to try to catch the cars.

25|$|By the 1930s {{the volume}} of {{agricultural}} traffic on the Cane Belt had steeply declined. In 1939, the railroad applied to the ICC {{to shut down the}} Bonus Loop from Bonus to Eldridge, the site of Eldridge's one-time plantation. The application was granted and service stopped on September 16, 1940. The Eldridge post office closed two years later. By this time shipments of rice, livestock, oyster shell for road surfacing and other freight began to fall. Sulphur was the backbone of the railroad. In 1945, in addition to 3,824 bales of cotton, the Cane Belt shipped 17,789 carloads of sulphur, 1,613 of oyster shell, 1,122 of petroleum products, 354 of rice and 82 of fruits and vegetables. The only fatal wreck during World War II claimed the lives of two brakemen when a train <b>ran</b> <b>through</b> an open <b>switch.</b> In those days brakemen earned $0.82 per hour.|$|R
